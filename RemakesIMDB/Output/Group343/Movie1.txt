		<shortDescription>Not so horrible for a Saturday afternoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went to see PULSE yesterday afternoon (got to the theater too late for DESCENT). I have not seen the original KAIRO for comparison. So, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, and not the best. Yes, it was slow to start and get to the point. But IMO it had a creepy, dark atmosphere (god, if I lived there I'd want to commit suicide in any case), the visuals weren't bad, and it had a few good scares. Unfortunately, it also depended on VOLUME to enhance the scare. If you're more of a gore fan, then it's probably not the movie for you. The movie may not be worth the price of a ticket, but I think it's worth a rental. Eh, I'm just your average moviegoer and don't watch movies to analyze them to death. I even liked The Grudge. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>strange...but not that bad (minor spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had just went to see a pre-screening of pulse last night, and I must say that it was not all that bad compared to recent horror films. The main problem with pulse is that in trying to be original it borrows from other films. I understand that this is an American version of a film from Japan. The film just reminded me of too many other films for me really to appreciate it. Once again this was a pre-screening and I am 100% sure that parts of the version I have seen will be changed. The other problem with pulse is that it is very hard to follow at times, and you are left to interpret the movie in your own way. The deaths are also very cheesy, and not really that creative. I am a huge horror fan and I was really interested to see this film because of the trailer that I very much enjoyed. The movie gets a boost in points for breaking away from the normal horror films we have been seeing as of late. Another thing that I had to pick at was the mediocre acting of the main star Kristen Bell. She just did not give a great performance...the rest of the cast with the exception of Ziagler give somewhat good performances. To continue on the scares were another part that bothered me..once again we see a pg13 movie relying on loud noises and crashes to make the audience jump...but on a brighter side there are a few scenes (the laundry room scene, and the car attack scene towards the end) that were actually pretty scary. One last thing the ending is not all that great, it is one of those things that you either love or hate...the audience at our screening mainly hated it, I will assume it will be changed come the release date. Overall "Pulse" is a decent horror film which is a step above the horror movies that I have seen as of late, just do not be surprised if you are left scratching your head after this film is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Have Nothing Better To Do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We just came home from seeing Pulse. Sorry friends, this is one film you won't be sorry you missed. Slow, boring, and lots of loose ends. No thrills, chills or characters you can care about. You are presented with a group of close friends -- yet no one seems concerned or even to notice that one of their buddies hasn't been around, anywhere, for a few days. No one seems to care when his fate is discovered. For some reason, all the college students seem to reside in apartments with black walls and leave food scattered all over the place to rot. I'm guessing the props dept had a lot of bugs around and wanted to use them up. Better to wait until this film shows up on cable at 3 am and you have nothing better to do before you watch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old predictable schlop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's another in a long, long line of predictable horror movies aimed at teens.Like so many tired teen horror films before it, we get a semi-interesting premise that is never given the chance to take off the ground. We get a tried-and-beaten-to-the-ground formula that's becoming nearly a parody of itself. "Pulse" has the laziest of horror film ambitions: an endless series of characters making slow, deliberate walks to some sort of random objective (in this movie, it is usually a computer screen) with the steadily rising score beneath their paces. And then, the orchestra crashes, the sound effects are blasted at dangerously high levels, and something (ghost, corpse, animal, landlady, Dick Cheney, etc.) bursts out at the character. Over and over and over. If the characters aren't doing that, they are setting up an opportunity to do so. Again and again and again. Such payoffs are not payoffs. They are sudden, very loud noises that explode suddenly after rising, slightly-softer noise.It's tough to tell whether the director is a cookie-cutter hack emulating everything that's been released in the last five years, or if he is just being ordered by the studio to emulate everything that's been released in the last five years. Either way, "Pulse" is a dreary movie with nothing to say and little thrills to share. Mostly, it's a take-off of "The Ring"...we get the always-overcast urban setting. A Naomi Watts look-alike as our lead. A lonely piano hits nearly the same keys as the above-mentioned film. And we get the quick cuts of single scenes. Instead of the mysterious video used in "The Ring", we get equally mysterious images in computer screens. At times, it has the disorienting sensation of watching a film student's class project titled "How To Make Creepy Images Like What Was Used In That Video In The Ring".Throughout the movie, characters go through the motions as if they've just been locked in a room watching a marathon of awful teen horror films. They laugh, they grieve, they act confused, they act scared, they act concerned, blah, blah, blah.A plot summary for those interested: an internet virus is rapidly spreading across a college campus. Basically, ghostly images appear on your computer screen, and then at some point in the near future, a ghostly image will sneak up on you and take what appears to be your soul. Thus, you are left very sad to the point of being despondent. After that, you off yourself. Or you just spontaneously combust into ash. Either way.The better looking of our leads manage to doge the virus, unlike literally the rest of civilization, despite the fact that they are more immersed in the virus than anyone else. Funny how that works. Whether or not they succeed in stopping this ghost virus (if you're the screenwriter there's no need to explain anything beyond "ghost virus" when all you're writing are set-ups for characters to peek slowly into things) is for you to find out. If you choose to find out, God bless you. Please keep in mind that it is a real bitch getting your ticket refunded at the average multiplex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altogether awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sure you are all familiar with how a good book can be ruined by its movie rendition. Well, this is a perfect example of how a good movie can be ruined by its American remake. Sure there are advantages to Hollywood-ification; take a look at the difference in special effects for 'The Ring' and 'The Grudge'. But, in turn, what is then sacrificed is quality in story and plot development, case and point being the American 'Ring 2' involving an attack from possessed deer. Yes... deer.The movie that inspired this one, 'Kairo' (aka 'Pulse'), had a very complex plot line with real suspense, real attachment of audience feeling, and real take-home messages. The storyline for the new 'Pulse' is something a child could have come up with and is highly reminiscent of a movie released a few years back - 'Dot com'. The whole direction and point of the American version is so far distant from that of the original Japanese that I have no idea why they didn't just separate themselves from it in the first place. Basically, whoever wrote the script had just seen 'Kairo' and thought to himself, "Hey, some of those scenes were awesome! And the way they did this and that? Wow." Twenty minutes later, the script for an 'original' Pulse was created where certain events were directly copied but liberated from all that 'plot' baggage.Honestly, I cannot find an ounce of merit for this film. Not suspenseful, not scary in the least, and even the effects failed to impress. The action felt rushed, the logic behind everything abandoned for the sake of a 'just go with it', and the message dumbed down so far that even the densest of movie-goers can get smacked across the face with it.I am not preaching that you should watch the original; just, please, for the sake of America's general intelligence level, do not consider this movie good or clever or inventive. Or good. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story really killed this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Pulse knowing it was PG13, so I didn't expect much gore, but couldn't the writer of this story at least have done something more with it?Pulse is a movie about a hacker who releases a strange computer virus which immediately affects computers everywhere as well as cell phones and even TV screens. We soon find out that the virus is really the dead who have found a way to return to the living world. What they want is the life force of every living being. So it is up to our heroes to try and find a way to stop them before they can consume the entire world.That's the plot which in my opinion was a rather clever idea. Too bad that the story makes very little sense and is filled with implausibilities that go against the very story that the writer and director were trying to get across. I won't explained these because of the spoilers that would be involved. Of course there aren't many spoilers anyway, since the commercials give much of it away.The acting was decent, and some of the visuals were nice, but there is very little suspense. This is more of a simple shock film like so many other horror movies that have been filling our theaters for about three years. There is one horror movie that is the exception, and that is The Descent which was released last week. If you want to see one of the best horror movies in the past couple years, go see that one instead and forget about Pulse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Idea Needing Better Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original Japanese film, "Kairo," upon which "Pulse" is based. There was enough here to make me want to see the original, though, because the central ideas in this film are very interesting. I suspect that much of the core of the original was lost in translating the story into a summer film for an American audience.The essential element of the story here is the idea that the technology that was created to connect us and make our lives more interesting is equally capable of sapping our individuality and will to live a real life, as opposed to giving ourselves up to thing like the Internet and cell phones. These things are meant to augment an already full existence, but when they become the most important things in our lives, we soon lose ourselves entirely. The ghosts in this movie are what is left of a person who has abandoned themselves to technology. They can "only exist where there's a signal," as the movie puts it, because when there is no signal, there is no life for such people. They rely on the real lives of others to give substance to their own artificial, inhuman existence, in other words. This is a powerful idea, and I wish that "Pulse" had taken more care in developing it.Instead, "Pulse" touches on this theme from time to time but sacrifices much of its importance to become a summer horror flick targeted to an 18-24 year old demographic without giving its audience much credit for its intelligence... and that's too bad, because the film winds up doing the very thing that the story should be a warning against doing. It sells its soul in the end.That's not to say there aren't some good scares here. There are certainly some very effective scenes in the film that will raise the hairs on a few necks. Considering that there is absolutely no gore anywhere to be seen in "Pulse," it does manage to frighten viewers with some potent ghostly images. Horror-savvy audiences will recognize elements from both "The Ring" and "Night of the Living Dead" at work here. Unlike the latter horror classic, however, "Pulse" tries too hard to shift between the plight of its central group of characters and the demise of civilization at large, diluting both and leaving me wishing that it had focused on one or the other.The acting in "Pulse" is nothing special. None of the characters ever fully develops. Other than the special effects nightmare that happens to them, one never has the chance to feel any connection to them before they evaporate in a puff of black ash. Considering how much the main theme of the movie rests upon the idea of someone's losing their will to live, that's a big problem. It would have been much more effective to show the transformation of people who actually have lives into depressed shells than what happens in "Pulse," where we see people who live vicariously through computers stop living altogether. There isn't much contrast between the two states; it's all a matter of which side of the computer screen a character is sitting on at any given moment.Still, if you're up for a couple of quick and effective scares, there's something to be said for "Pulse." It could have been so much more, though, with just a bit more work. Ah well. I'll have to see if "Kairo" did any better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Commentary from a former Japan resident</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For what its worth, I enjoyed this movie. I tend to rent all B-movie DVD's from my local Blockbuster (big plug for the movie pass). Despite what many of the folks have posted on this site, I can tell you that I have seen The Grudge, The Ring, The Darkness, and many other Japanese remakes. I also have lived in Japan for many years and (as much as westerners can), I claim an understanding of their film-making. I thought that this movie was well done, but I cannot in good faith recommend any other remakes. Unfortunately, there is generally an element lost in translation. Luckilly, IMO, Pulse does not lose that and manages to keep its Japanese nature very well intact in its U.S. translation. Kudos to the producers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as you might think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the trailer for this movie some time ago, and I decided to watch it. It's one of those horror movies with eerie sets and shots. They chose Bucharest, Romania as a main location, so I found familiar places in it. The campus featured in the film is the one from "Politehnica" University.The movie itself is well written and has a coherent plot. Of course, there are times when you can predict the next turn of events. But this does not happen very often.The special effects are OK, not dated or something. They integrate very well in the unfolding of the plot. The soundtrack is also good, many low frequency noises, kind of electric ones (reminds me of "The Ring").For a remake of a J horror movie, this one does a pretty good job. Worth watching if you have a couple of hours to spare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God I had a girl to make out with during this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happened to go to Universal Citywalk (Universal Studios, Hollywood) to watch this film. That means I actually paid an additional dollar (11.00 ticket) plus the ten dollars parking. This isn't even factoring in the fact that I was on a date (Yet another occasion in which Tom Leykis is dead on). Essentially I wasted nearly triple what it would have cost me had I had the sense to watch this at the local theater, let alone avoiding it altogether.This movie is utter garbage. The actor Samm Levine was in the theater watching the movie, perhaps curious to see the audience's reaction (He played the character Tim in the film). The girl I was with spotted him, having watched "Freaks and Geeks", a program I haven't seen, but a large number of people were whispering about the fact that he was there."Isn't that guy in the movie?" "Hey, it's that Freaks and Geeks guy." The guy walked out of the movie, after people were booing as the credits scrolled, and said to his friends, "Seriously, what kind of idiot would agree to be in a film like that?" The sarcasm was clear. His entourage found it quite amusing. Apparently, he realized that the script sucked, and agreed to be in the film for the paycheck. Good thing he isn't a better known actor, or he might have actually been attacked by people wanting their money back for this waste of time.Having virtually no character development, this film depicts the story of a internet virus that apparently has the ability to manifest itself in the physical world. Whether this is simply a virus, or supernatural phenomenon is never clearly explained. It is quite possible the virus simply happens to appear in a form which typically causes teenage girls to fling popcorn in fright.At a certain point, we learn that the virus, or 'PULSE', is only able to cause manifestations of these creatures through electronic devices, or hot-spots. So, for example, a creature could attack you if you were simply walking anywhere within cellphone coverage. (This is never clearly explained, it is stated in the film that cellphones act as conduits through which the creatures can manifest, yet apparently they are able to appear in any area covered by a cell satellite, yet leaving cellphones behind has some sort of beneficial effect...) Aside from the fact that half the theater left halfway through the movie, I continued to watch it, why... I cannot tell you clearly. Perhaps it was the same reason people slow down on the freeway to view car accidents.I cannot think of a simple redeeming quality about this film. Sorry to spoil it for the slightly perverted, or any fans of celeb porn sites, who might perhaps be hoping to see Veronica Mars show some skin, but she barely exposes her neck during the film.One of my favorite moments in the film was the scene in which Dexter (Ian Somerhalder) addresses Mattie (Kristen Bell) by her first name, regardless of the fact that she never introduced herself.Oh, by the way, these rules, regarding the presence of the creatures, or whatever you want to call them, is not clearly explained until the end of the film. The only thing revealed at the beginning is that Red Duct Tape repels the creatures. I guess you aren't supposed to think about this, because following this course of logic established in the movie: 1: The creatures exist within the virtual world, and in the real world in areas under the reach of wireless internet access and cellular transmission.2: The creatures are repelled by Red Duct Tape, which blocks the frequency at which they exist.THEREFORE Conclusion: Red Duct Tape blocks cellphone signals.Someone alert medical institutions nationwide, because this movie has just revealed the solution to those annoying people using their cellphones in hospitals, which disrupt medical equipment.All we need to do is coat the buildings in Red Duct Tape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulse flatlines!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Towards the end of Pulse, a US remake of the hit Asian horror Kairo, there was a moment which actually made me jump. It was a cheap mechanical scare that was totally predictable, but it still managed to jolt me. And I was grateful that it did, because it stopped me from lapsing fully into a coma.After the dreadful American remakes of other J-horror hits such as The Ring, The Grudge and Dark Water, all of which did their best to cause my brain to shut down entirely, I did wonder about the wisdom of watching yet another. But I'm a fair man, and I like to give films the benefit of the doubt, so in went the disc...Sporting a grungy, desaturated look, and nasty MTV style editing, Pulse is typical of the unimaginative and stale horror output that has blighted the genre this decade. The film, aimed at the teen demographic, does away with logic, suspense and a decent plot; instead, we get an easy-on-the-eye cast, some cool CGI effects, and a story that makes no sense whatsoever.In this confusing tale, a hacker accidentally allows strange creatures from another dimension to come into our world, using communication devices as conduits. Once in our world, these things suck out our will to live, which results in people either disintegrating into ash, or committing suicide (and by the end of the film, you'll know exactly how they feel!). As these monsters slowly take over any part of the world in which technology allows them access, a couple of teens discover the existence of a computer virus which may be able to put an end to the evil invaders, but with red tape as their only protection (don't ask!), will they succeed?Dreary cinematography, coupled with a dull-as-ditchwater script and uninspired performances from a bored looking cast, make Pulse an experience that I am not in a hurry to repeat. Director Jim Sonzero manages one or two visually impressive moments (involving the bizarre other-worldly freaks, which look like they're straight out of a Chris Cunningham video), but for the most part, he seems content to translate the illogical, badly written and plot-hole ridden screenplay into uninspired visual tripe, without giving a moment's thought to the fact that nothing makes much sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd rather spend a night lancing blemishes with a rusted needle than watch this again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no words in the English language that can adequately describe just how terrible this film really is, but let's see if I can try to describe it.First, a question to Wes Craven: Did you even THINK about research before writing this script? Was it too much effort to actually research the topic of modern technology before attempting to write this pseudo-trendy wannabe horror film? Perhaps it's time for that nursing home now, Wes. Perhaps you could scare your roommates there because you surely didn't scare anybody with this film.The only thing that frightened me about this movie is the knowledge that there are people out there who will actually like it. That's far scarier than anything you will see in this pathetic mix of 'Scream' and 'The Ring'. Imagine 'The Ring' with annoying, spoiled college kids forced into suicide after a computer virus decodes demons out of thin air. Somehow, the only way these kids can defend themselves is with red duct tape - something that is neither explained nor remotely conceivable. If you can imagine that, then don't see this film as whatever you've pictured HAS TO BE BETTER THAN THIS.First in the long, long list of problems with this film is the fact that it was made at all. Second to that, the absolute lack of anything close to logic regarding technology is astounding. It's as if the person that wrote this simply skimmed an issue of PC Weekly and wrote the entire script by randomly inserting technological terms they thought sounded modern or impressive. Third problem in the list is how desperate the film feels - desperate to be "hip" or "in". This film is not unlike the woman you see hanging around in the mall wearing clothes that she is WAY too old to be wearing. That's how this movie feels. It tries so hard to pander to a young audience that it literally becomes a joke. Wes should have called this script "Hey kids, I'm still cool, right?". Yawn.Another one of the many flaws is the "heroine" of the story. So stupid is she that she hears a military message on the radio stating that cell phones, computers and PDA's are dangerous and IMMEDIATELY opens up her cell phone - only to get attacked. I found myself ENCOURAGING the internet demon things - I actually cheered the thing on - "Eat her, yeah, suck out her soul or whatever it is you're supposed to be doing!" Already I've spent more time discussing this terrible excuse for a waste of time so I'll summarise : From inane opening to ridiculous end, this film is a larger waste of time than harvesting maggots for fun and profit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intense, Awesome Horror Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As remakes of Japanese horror movies go, Pulse is actually pretty good. It's directed by commercials whiz Jim Sonzero, who combines low lighting and impressive effects work to create a genuinely creepy atmosphere. Despite the high-tech nature of the premise, Sonzero is careful to have the creepiest scenes occur in all-too-familiar places such as the bath, the toilet and, in the film's most terrifying scene, the laundry room. Kristen Bell makes an excellent lead and even survives a not-at-all-gratuitous T-shirt change scene with her integrity intact. Somerhalder is good too and there's strong support from Milian and from Ron Rifkin as Mattie's skeptical shrink. There's also a superb crowd-pleasing cameo, which it would be churlish to reveal here. The only problem with the film (providing you buy into the premise in the first place) is that Kel O'Neill (as the mysterious Zieglar) really overacts his crucial explanation scene and comes close to derailing the movie altogether. Fortunately, however, he's only in the one scene.In short, Pulse can comfortably join the ranks of Japanese horror remakes that are actually quite good, alongside The Ring and Dark Water. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad movie of the fifth kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we say that a movie is "bad", we should to be more specific; I can think of at least five different kinds of bad movies.1) Bad movies with One Obvious Flaw (often the ending, sometimes the casting of a major player) which ruins everything else, but the filmmakers seem oblivious to this. See: I Am Legend, whose epilogue tosses the source material's darkly ironic twist into the dumpster.2) Bad movies of the "slick Hollywood blockbuster" variety. Competent cast, fine cinematography, the whole thing shallow and toothless: a neatly wrapped package with garbage inside. See: The Haunting remake.3) My favorites: unintentionally hilarious bad movies. See: The Wicker Man remake.4) "Lowest common denominator" bad movies - sex comedies, torture porn, sentimental maudlin. The cinematic equivalent of stepping into canine feces. See: Hostel.5) And, finally, bad movies like Pulse - so aggressively worthless they don't give critics much to chew on. They are not funny, but tedious; you can't list plot holes, because there isn't a plot and there isn't a story; everything is so useless, the only possible reaction is an incredulous shrug.The subtext here is actually interesting, if not too subtle: technology surrounds us (internet, cell phones...), and yet it isolates us, sapping our vital energies, like the ghost-like entities haunting the protagonists.Or the movie itself, I guess.Pulse is shot in washed out grays and blues; the purpose is creating a creepy atmosphere, the result is an ugly-looking film where everything has a cadaverous hue. It's a movie which features a twenty-five years old Kristen Bell taking a hot bath and manages to make it look boring, for crying out loud.Actors don't really matter here. Laurence Olivier couldn't have done much better; a beginning drama student couldn't have done much worse. Characters don't have any depth or personality - they're rats in a maze, although without the frantic quality of the rodents. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go watch the original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would just like to say that you'd probably be better off watching the original. For reasons that make the Japanese version that much more powerful.1) The Japanese version is set in a time period where the Internet is "new" so this makes for a much more mysterious set of events as people are still not use to the everyday aspects of the Internet. 2) Since this movie is another import from Japanese horror one could say that this is just another attempt to capitalize on the genre that Hollywood has created for itself, that of the imported/re-shoot/foreign film. 3) There is a certain aspect of desperation in the original as the director &amp; writer try to convey the concept that despite technology we as humans are growing further apart and finding it harder to connect leaving us alone in a world full of people. So please for your sake, if you want to enjoy this movie go get the Japanese original. It's at Blockbuster, you can watch it in the comfort of your own home and if you don't like subtitles then put the dubbing option in the audio settings on...because the movie is worth it.- Teno Dulina</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard a lot of bad things about this movie, so instead of seeing it in the theater, I waited for it's video/DVD release, but I actually kind of wish I'd seen it in the theater to begin with. The film centers around Mattie, a college student. After her boyfriend becomes withdrawn, she goes to check in on him - but she notices his behavior is somehow different, like a mindless drone. He then unexpectedly kills himself in his bedroom. Mourning his death and trying to find answers, Mattie, along with a man named Dexter (who was sold Josh's computer after his death) begin to discover a chain of bizarre suicides and some very frightening material on Josh's hard drive. Strange events begin to plague Mattie and her circle of friends, and Josh keeps on contacting them through his computer, despite the fact that he's dead. It seems like the entire city is dropping like flies and becoming a dead zone, and strange entities are communicating and taking people's lives through electronic devices - cell phones, computers, etc. As the ghosts slowly begin to take over, Dexter and Mattie try to fight it with a virus that Josh had built, in hopes that they can destroy the system of ghosts that are spreading.After watching this movie and seeing the IMDb user rating (which is currently a 3.8), I was really surprised. "Pulse" is a pretty solid movie. It's based on a Japanese horror film, so I'd have to give the original filmmakers the credit for coming up with such a unique storyline, but I still have to give a good amount of credit to those involved with this remake. Since the story was so interesting, it makes sense for the film to be remade in English, so that Americans and others will be able to experience the film (along with the other strings of Japanese horror remakes, like "The Ring" and "The Grudge"). The sense of impending doom is hovering over the film the entire time, and that makes things even more uncomfortable. I liked the idea that something that we rely on so much in this day and age - modern technology - can become something that can ultimately lead to our downfall. Is there an underlying message in this film? I think so.Along with the great plot, the film is brought to life with some very good writing, interesting cinematography, and a worthwhile cast. Kristen Bell plays the lead, Mattie, and makes herself a very likable character that we can easily relate to. Dexter is played by Ian Somerhalder, who doesn't have a whole lot of screen time, but does what he can with it. The movie is consistent with it's color scheme, everything seems to have a very blue-ish and dark tint to it, and it really makes the audience feel like they're experiencing the end of the world themselves. The special effects featured in the film were really mind blowing though. The ghosts weren't too overdone, and there was some great (and very convincing) CGI used quite appropriately. All in all, "Pulse" is a pretty underrated movie. Along with similar end-of-the-world type thrillers, this film boasts an interesting premise that really speaks for technology, and is brought to life very well. I'm kind of surprised at how low the rating here is. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfarily judged, not a bad movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having looked at some of the posts for this movie, i find it to be well unfairly frowned upon. This movie wasn't actually that bad, the plot was actually a little better to swallow than a crazy demon beasty that hacks people legs off and uses em as drumsticks. OK this ain't a true story or anything but the acting was above average and the tension built in several key scenes was pretty good. OK the use of music as in all horror movies does tend towards the quiet to loud shrieky violin type shock tactics but hey, this film ain't going for an Oscar ya know. The only grievances i had was the handling of a couple of the sub characters come the end but ah well you cant have everything, also the ending was a bit lacking i personally would have cut it a little shorter by a couple mins but ah well.To sum up you want a horror movie to watch but without the huge amounts of blood, maiming, demon ass whooping!, then this ain't the one for you. If you want to watch a movie where the scary points actually do try to make you jump out of your seat then it is worth a view.Ah well there is my two pennies worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really as bad as many say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I spent my Sunday afternoon catching up on some films, one of which was Pulse. While I certainly do not think that it is a superb representation of the horror genre I thought it was very effective and a decent way to spend a couple of hours. I think a large number of commenter's who dislike the film feel that the open-endedness of it contributed to its demise. I wish they would have left it more open-ended however. The final voice-over offered to provide closure to the audience could have been left out in my opinion.The film is largely commentary on todays online and connected society. In many ways it represents the fact that people are sucked into this online life and as a result, the technology that was meant to bring us all closer together, instead tends to lead to isolationism and loneliness. The film lacks many true horror moments in which elicit screams (or for that matter much of any reaction) from the audience. In fact, several people in the theater in which I saw it laughed. It does have some very well constructed scenes. I felt the set design led to an overall feeling of despair, and the dark gloomy lighting very effectively spun the mood. It is another one of those films where we do not have our hands held throughout the film while the director spoon feeds the theme to us. I tend to like films that leave something for the viewer to figure out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible. Rent Kairo and save yourself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all-just don't go see this movie. If you have netflix-or thirty bucks, buy the original pulse, known as 'Kairo' in japan. If you think the trailers look promising, believe me, they aren't. Those scenes are the only scary ones in the entire movie, and you know when they're coming. Plus, the scary scenes were taken frame by frame from Kairo, and Kairo actually has a plot. The acting was horrible, and although written by Wes Craven, the dialog is weak and cheesy. I feel bad for the poor people who haven't seen Kairo, because I own and have seen it several times, and I still cannot understand this American version. Kairo was scary. Kairo had a message. The closest thing Pulse got to a message was Kirsten Bell's character at the end, with her mediocre narration and sums up of the situation she found herself in. Just awful. Go see The Descent. Definitely worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant. A post-9/11 horror masterpiece!I have to defend this excellent little epic of nightmare cinema from all you logic hounds out there who can't stand movies that don't explain everything to you. This is dream-logic film-making at its creepy, subconscious best. Irrational, inexplicable, inevitable, and inescapable: It's the end of the world as we know it. Like the amazing Dawn of the Dead remake, it taps into our post-9/11 anxieties and turns everyday reality on its head. Like the French thriller Cache, it brings real terror and paranoia into our homes. And like Todd Hayne's Safe, it offers no easy way out.Surprisingly, this American version retains the original Japanese film's bleak atmosphere and irrational plotting, leading the viewer slowly and inexorably to the bitter end. Spoiler: The protagonists try to save the world and actually fail: how often does that happen in Hollywood movies these days? Pulse reminds me of apocalyptic horror classics like Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, David Cronenberg's Videodrome and Crash, Roman Polansky's Repulsion, and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining -- visionary films that were also dismissed when they were first released.Visually, this new Pulse is stunning, probably because director Jim Sonzero comes from the disciplined world of commercial advertising. Check out his high-tech ghosts in slow-motion on your DVD. Freaky. And notice how the streets and classrooms keep getting emptier, darker and grimier as the film progresses; the world is quietly coming to an end but no one is doing anything about it! Chilling. All in all, the over all effect is downright disturbing.Too bad Pulse isn't getting the recognition it deserves. I, for one, can't wait to see what the director does next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate when people laugh in movie theaters. This is the only time that I can condone, and even participate, in this juvenile activity. That's how horrific this film is - and not the good kind of horrific, either. The whole audience was laughing throughout at all the unintentionally funny parts. It's almost a parody of the recent horror movies ala Ringu and Ju-On. It literally lifts shots straight from The Ring and The Grudge. The acting is astonishingly wooden and vomit-inducing. What could've been an effective, intense chiller instead was the worst horror movie I've ever seen. It's as if it was directed by a robot that had seen horror movies, but when attempting to make one, had no idea how to pull it off like the others did. I'll admit, the sets were creepy. But this movie is proof that it takes more than freaky nightmare imagery to make a scary movie. It's as if the writers took Horror Movies 101 and took notes on every single cliché, and instead of avoiding them, accidentally thought they were supposed to use them. We get:-fake jump scares (a friend walks up to a girl and yells, "Hey!" in her ear, then apologizes when she is startled, as if what he did was perfectly natural) -scary ghosts in mirrors -pale white corpse ghosts that walk in a glitchy, jerky fashion -they even walk like a spider in one scene! -creepy videos -hot blonde lead woman in a bra for no real reason other than: hot blonde lead woman...in a bra! -crazy black woman that gets mad for no reason! -random decrepit withering cat in a closet -stupid people doing insanely stupid things like walking into a dark room where they heard a ghostThe two funniest scenes that garnered the most laughter were: The lead is in a bathtub and she sees a face in the water. Then, a sponge plops up to the surface! AHHHH!And the scene where a woman is doing laundry and her clothes keep falling out of the washer. Whoops!!I was waiting for a child to say, "You let the dead get in." I had a good time, though. The only people I can imagine would find this scary are people that have never seen a horror movie before. Everyone else, stay away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiffy Productions review of Pulse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*note* If you were freaked out by the ring, this is a movie for you!*note*Went to see Pulse today, expecting it to deliver, and it was everything I Expected, and maybe more! Pulse was another one of the movies I like to call "Electronic Horror" which involves T.V's, Cpu's, And anything else like that. In this film you will see some things that are, putting this lightly by the way, Freeky! You'll see crap that maybe haunt you for awhile, but still keeps a great cinematic atmosphere and also keeps it fun at the same time. You'll watch People losing there will to live and also watch them... well, Go see the movie and you'll find out ^_^Anyway, lets talk about some of the positives and negatives+: 1. Great Directing: through out the entire film you'll see interesting angles and motions that you usually never see!2. Interesting script: The screenplay was co-written by Wes Craven. Yea I know he's delivered some bad crap before *cough*Redeye*cough* but this may have redeemed him! OF course though, he can't take all the credit because this was originally a Jap. film, but I Know he added some thrills of his own!At any rate, the story was awesome and it may leave you wanting to turn off your cellular Phone for awhile.3. Decent acting: acting was a little better than normal, but some people still sucked. It was believable though!-: 1. Some cheesiness: In true Wes Craven Fashion, some cheesiness will be detected. But it's not Full Blown like Freddy though.2. Some Problems with details: One thing that is commonly rampant through horror films is the absence of details. Sure, some use this as a way to really make you fear the unknown, but this film should have had some more details to it. They should not give you some details and then leave figuring out the rest. 3. some annoying sound effects: Some scenes make you cringe, not because of the script, but because of the rampant annoying screeching from the background. this is a turn off.Overall score: 7.5 Out of 10 *rounded up to 8 for the IMDb poll*Final thoughts: Great movie considering Hollywood lately has been shoveling out crap *cough*Zoom, material girls, barnyard, ATV, anything Micheal bay, etc.*cough*. Hopefully more films this year will improve!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's bad, it's bad, it's really really bad!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's far too easy to ridicule "Pulse" for being the latest in a never ending carousel of Asian horror remakes. Yes, the picture has the same familiar scent and taste as "The Ring" and "The Grudge," yet "Pulse" has the cruel distinction of being the harebrained production that took a healthy swig of goofball juice and actually tries to pretend that everything it dramatizes makes sense in the end. Now that's ballsy.The first mistake made in "Pulse" was asking Wes Craven to take a crack at the screenplay (with Ray Wright). Having long ago lost his horror mojo, Craven is the last guy to ask to write a film where the internet is the bad guy. That's right, that delightful place where goods are purchased with ease and pornography is readily available is supposed to be evil incarnate here; a portal for some type of creature to sneak in to our tennis court called life and rocket a volley down our throat. In my book, "Fear Dot Com" was pretty much the final word on the nonexistent potential for online horror, but hey, "The Ring" made 100 mil+ in the U.S., so I can't blame Hollywood for trying to remake anything Japanese they could get their greasy hands on.It would've helped to have someone of artistic weight directing "Pulse" who had a capacity to manage the puzzle pieces of the plot with a splash of clarity. Riddled with obtuse plotting and a noticeable lack of continuity, "Pulse" steams forward with such unabashed inanity, you really have to give your brain a rest to even make it to the end. This film is making up its rules up it goes, using bizarrely conceived (and PG-13 neutered) fright set-pieces to cover up the fact that the story is a mess and not a lick of effort was put into caring for any of the characters.Featuring bone-white ghost people (check), a cast of no discernible talent (yep, seen that before), and a contrived nihilistic tone the slumbers into baffling apocalyptic proportions, there's nothing to "Pulse" that feels urgent. It wears its box office aspirations on its sleeve, leaving creativity to fend for itself while it dishes up the same tired scare routines for teenagers with nothing better to do on a Saturday night.What "Pulse" is trying to say about the dangers of a fully wired community is made crystal clear in the finale. However, this message makes much more sense when placed on more claustrophobic Japanese grounds. Transplanting the story to America relieves the film of its primal horror, along with the feeling of isolation and constipated communication that's built into the premise, but forgotten by the filmmakers. Of course, this is the same movie that, after establishing doomsday is making a stop in their town, features a scene where Milian's character takes time to do her laundry. Because if the end is near, you'll want to feel clean for the demons that are spilling out of hard drives to nibble on your soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven Does it again. And that's not saying much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since "scary" movies have started getting away with accepting a PG-13 rating, most of them have gone to crap. That's not to say that gore is my thing and some PG-13 movies actually succeed at fitting the genre.I gave this movie a very generous 1 (almost a 1.2) because the ending get's more imaginative, yet still incredibly predictable and the whole cast of characters gullible and oblivious to anything that resembles intelligence.Somewhere around 1988, Wes Craven lost his originality and became formulaic. The SCREAM series began the bubble gum pop culture horror flicks that just weren't based on much more than some new teen faces who you didn't mind seeing get whacked. This movie just seems to reek of the last creative thing he did do. A Nightmare on Elm St. College Campus vs. High school. The evil you can't see is comin' to getcha. I think Wes' finer current moments will be defined in the slew of remakes other people do of his older works like THE HILLS HAVE EYES. He use to be one of the defining writer/directors in the genre, but took a dump on that in the 90's. Even Sam Raimi knew when to move onto other things.These remakes of Asian horror flicks never capture me. That may just be a me thing. The enemy is always grey and bends in ways that would make a chiropractor jealous. Just not scary. The sad thing is that this is the redeeming element of this flick.Bottom line = This is the kind of movie that will only encourage illegal movie downloading and still make you want your money back for the CD you burned it to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulse is a misnomer. This film is lifeless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pulse is a strong candidate for worst film of the year. It's completely devoid of any interesting characters, any interesting camera work or visuals, and anything the least bit horrifying.Set in what i assume to be a futuristic time where everything looks the same as it does now, only there's no sunlight or working indoor lighting, Pulse tries to makes us afraid of our digital machinery, as if it were a new storing place for hell's angels. Instead, it makes us afraid of more Japan horror being remade as cheap one-note American crap.i don't know where to begin to describe the banality of this film. Another reviewer really nailed it when they said the film would be more tense if we actually cared whether the lead actors lived or died. Even the normally plucky and watchable Milian is relegated to interchangeable terrified and puzzled looks. The soul stealing imagery and black plague like marks that are supposed to be so terrifying get lost in the film's direction, and would be scarier as a series of still photographs.The lack of sunlight makes the characters seem pale and boring, or maybe they were just that way to begin with. Inexplicable coincidences and convenient meetings attempt to stitch the film together but it's a total lost cause. Who, what, or where it all happened are completely lost by the end of the film, and the sense of bewilderment i felt at the end was perhaps the most horrifying part of the experience.i have seen the future of reality horror, and it is sitting through a screening of Pulse.Grade: F</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally an actual horror movie that isn't all blood and guts. The first this year maybe? But anyways I didn't know what to expect from this movie after seeing the previews but I was quite surprised because it delivered.The plot is.....unique. Someone let out a virus where the dead will come out of anything that has any sort of communication waves. Phones, Computers, etc. So many of the people get taken over by this virus until one of the main characters boyfriend who committed suicide's computer was found and inside of the casing was a hidden anti-virus on a separate disc so it would be off the network away from the dead. So they need to upload the anti-virus on the main computer network that started it all. Confusing in words but it will make sense in person.The acting was good. Everyone displayed emotion well and was very enthused about the movie. Also the director did a good job keeping everything on track and keeping any loose ends out of the movie. The fact that it all had a very good flow made this movie a pleasure to watch and made it actually creepy.Now like I said this is one of the only horror films of the year not consisting of all blood and guts. And I thank them for making this movie. And guess what, it actually was kinda scary. Even though one part of the movie was really stupid but oh well we'll just ignore that. The movie was overall creepy and made me walk out of the theater thinking 'Whoa', and a movie that does that to me is a well made movie.The way it was shot was interesting too. The way the dead sort of cut out and came back like an actual computer was wicked. Even sometimes the whole screen had little cut out waves on it so it feels like your vision is actually happening exactly like you're in the movie. Which impressed me and I really enjoyed that factor.Overall I loved this movie. Everything about it, if I want to see a scary movie I'll see this movie, and you should go see it as well, for you won't waste your money on it....Unless you some how don't like it.</fullReview>

A drowned girl becomes a supernatural videographer. How preposterous? The Grudge was so un scary compared to Pulse. The little boy in white pancake make-up . Wow. I was shaking in my seat. I think this director broke new ground. The film looks awesome and the monsters are so cool. The laundry room scene with Christina Millian is the scariest sequence I have seen in a PG 13 horror film. Pulse is a visual joyride and a visceral thrill. The audience I saw it with was screaming and jumping out of their seats. If you haven't seen Pulse yet you should.

		<shortDescription>a different step</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eh I think this movie deserved an 8 actually, but with the insane amount of people just voting 1, I need to balance that out.The reason why it's 8 is mainly because, although a bit unfair reason, the actors are all new ones. Another HUGE reason is because Wes craven did the screen play, hence all the epileptic flashing of the computers/ghosts. Another downside is that the movie is a bit too short and it doesn't cover many things mentioned in the plot (eg 'bagman'). Same goes with the rushed ending. I would've preferred the Japanese version's ending.In my summary, I wrote a different step mainly because unlike The Descent, this movie doesn't need to rely on cheap 'jump' scares that many movies do. However, if that's your thing, then go for it, but Pulse is more on the line of disturbing and downright morbid. This film certainly also has a very depressing tone to it too, what with the dark images and atmosphere of all the shots. The cuts made to the film by Dimension Films really raped the movie. They took out many key scenes (tower-jumper, etc.) just to hit the pg-13 rating.Honestly, I think PG-13 is pretty unfair, as there's a HUGE theme on suicide and many images are very disturbing, especially for some kids.Versus the Japanese version, I actually prefer this one over the Japanese one, although the Japanese covers more plot and the ending is better. With the remake, the story moves at a MUCH faster pace without boring, dragged on scenes. And I know many of you want the 'subtleness' or the 'deepness' of the slow shots in the Japanese version, but it was really testing my patience.I definitely prefer this over The Descent and over the Japanese version (you should watch both though, Japanese one first). And this movie definitely hit many interesting concepts and never kept you bored without the use of 'jump' scares, a major accomplishment for many American movies.The remake of the Grudge is also worth checking out too.</fullReview>

The story was easy to follow, the perfect "freak out" moments were there, and the cast was pretty good. I personally enjoyed watching Ian Somerhalder. There are the cheesy horror movie moments, but what movie doesn't have that? The ghosts are pretty scary. They have a human element, that is overtly freaky. It was a good late night scare.

The lead actress Kristen Bell is gorgeous and maybe a good actress for romantic comedies, but her face has no expression in the dramatic scenes when her friends die, or in the creepy and scary scenes, when she is attacked by the forces.

		<fullReview>I just don't know why is the film made? What was the purpose? I wanted to watch "Pulse" when it was on the cinemas but I never got a chance because it was hardly on for a week, so I rented it when the movie was out on DVD. It was completely crap, stupid, dull, boring, depressing and simply the worst film I have ever seen! Although I really like films that have advance modern technology. Then I understood why the film dropped out the cinemas so soon it would be a miracle if it was on at least for a week. The movie was about an hour &amp; a half and I hated every second of it, first a ghost appears out of nowhere later someone wants to commit suicide then someone else turns into ashes, I mean nothing but nonsense. The filmmakers tried to take technophobia to a new level e.g. fear of computers &amp; mobile phones which did not work, I don't think anyone will unplug their computer or throw away their mobile phone. I text my friends with my mobile phone to tell them how rubbish this film is and I logged on my computer to give my comment for this title &amp; I had no trouble using them. Although it has a very low rating but not low enough it should be No.1 on IMDb bottom 100! Do not fall for the tag-line which is "Scariest film of the year" it's not even a jot scary, definitely did not make my pulse pound the only horror that occurred was the money I spent for the rent. The tag-line should be "Stupidest film of the century" so avoid this torture device at all costs or you will be sticking red tape all over your TV screen!

		<fullReview>I think this movie rocks! I think it's one of the scariest movies of the year. I just don't get why people hate 'Pulse' so much. But I think I know why. I think people watched the preview, and it seemed like it had a pretty good storyline. And then when they watched the movie, it had a totally different storyline than they thought it would have.I'll admit, when I saw the preview, it did look scarier than the movie. But the preview left a lot of stuff out that the movie didn't have. It's hard to explain, but once you see the movie, you'll know what I mean.'Pulse' is a very chilling film that is about the dead finding a portal in computers, cell phones, etc., into our world. And because of this plot line, people might get scared of their own computers and cell phones. I think that's a really good way to scare people because instead of 'Pulse' having lots of jump-out-at-you surprises (which by the way, it does), it has a way of scaring people in real life.I'm just surprised they didn't think of televisions as portals for the dead to get through. The only things mentioned and seen in the movie for the dead to get through from were computers and cell phones.'Pulse' is full of jump-out-at-you scares and other kinds of surprises that make your mouth fly open in shock. Each scare kept eclipsing the last and each thrill kept eclipsing the last, too.All in all, 'Pulse' is a very chilling movie that is well...chilling.Oh, and when you read the back of the DVD, at the end of the summary, it says 'astonishing surprise ending', or something like that, but I know it said surprise ending. Well, the ending isn't really that surprising. But, to see an astonishing ending, read this tips: 1. Go to the special features menu on the 'Pulse' DVD.2. Go to Deleted/Alternate scenes.(MINOR SPOILER HERE): 3. Go to the 'Dexter Dies' deleted/alternate scene.(MINOR SPOILER ENDS) 4. Enjoy the deleted/alternate surprise ending.I don't know why the filmmakers didn't keep the scene there. The ending would have been so much better.My MPAA rating: PG-13: Intense Sequences of Sci-Fi Terror, Deeply Disturbing Images, Language, Some Brief Sensuality, and Thematic Material My Canadian rating: 14A: Frightening Scenes, Disturbing Content, Mature Themes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting movie this Pulse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This pulse movie is interesting in its own science fiction Horrer sort of a way. Talking with the dead through computers now this is a new one for me. Sure looks like something taken from the world of Asia anime or film. Looks more so trendy over there as well. The actresses play a key role in the development of the plot of this film, which most people are saying is pretty shallow from the heart up. I am wondering how much did it cost to actually make this film. I highly doubt this film will be a cult classic, but there is enough in this film to have an entertaining evening I have to say. Not as catchy as Ricky bobby, but shows that any kind of strange idea can go these days when putting together a film.Mikhalt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie yesterday with a couple of friends. Lets start off by saying this was a movie that Dimension (studio that should not make horror movies) had cut down over 30 minutes of footage to make it pg-13 which supposedly equals more money. Anyway the movie was actually well done. The atmosphere was really dark, the lighting really good, make-up, and visuals were awesome. If you like the Ring or the Grudge, you should definitely watch this. If you like gore, maybe this isn't your thing. I'm into the more atmospheric, visual, and sound of a movie, so this thing freaked me out. Don't pass it up, though. I can't wait for a directors cut when it comes out on DVD. To summarize it up, I enjoyed it, give it a chance. Oh and props to Kristen Bell and Christina Millian. They did a pretty damn good job in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Insult To The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to see the original 2001 Japanese movie Pulse(Kairo)But I was also lucky enough to see his earlier films the best being Kyua (1997) (Cure).His films tend be abstract set pieces dealing with complex human emotion, in the original Pulse the central theme was extreme isolation and loneliness, suddenly people you cared about were disappearing and the world was ending. Basically everything I've just written summarized the entire experience of the original film.But then how did all that change? Enter Wes Craven, who after making this film is clearly out of touch to what makes a good modern horror film. He literally took out all the abstract surreal spookiness that made the original good and did what any cliché director would do. He used Expositing like it was going out of style, he explained Everything. Then when you do that, you basically end up a with a pointless special FX boo driven nonsense. Craven will be the kiss of death for modern horror. (For the record: Kiyoshi Kurosawa did not take part in the screenplay process, if pay close attention to the opening credits it was Wes Craven and another writer.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pulse was not the worst horror flick I've seen but it was far from the best. For her first horror film Kristen Bell did a great job. As did Ian Somerhalder. The rest of the cast seemed to be lacking quite a bit. Honestly when the whole thing was over and done with the only characters I felt were worth anything were Mattie and Dex. The others were all so blah, its hard to care about them. Ron Rifkin played his part quite well, even though we're never really sure what his character's purpose is. From what I gathered he is some kind of psychologist or something that is around to tell Mattie shes imaginging things. Then when his computer asks him if he wants to see a ghost it shows some woman who he has framed on his desk. Who the hell is this woman? And who the hell is he?! I know I shouldn't nitpick but damn they could give us a little back story! The ending was the best part of this film. I was completely fooled. I thought Dex would install the virus that would kill the server the ghosts are coming through on just in time and it would actually work and the world will be saved. I think its pretty neat that they took it in a different direction than most horror movies. However, I left the thing feeling a little disappointed. This movie had some great potential, but I think they ruined it on focusing too much on world destruction rather than the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid, sometimes rewarding look at modern living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pulse is a relatively close translation of a subtle Japanese horror film called "Kairo". Unlike its brethren (Ring, Grudge, etc.) Kairo was less a fantastical horror film than a grim psychological look at modern, tech-laden urban living. Despite a lot of slick looking supernatural content, Pulse largely succeeds in preserving the focus of the original--steering our attention to individuals rather than ghosts or evil entities.The plot, which some will find tough to embrace, has a computer virus interacting with ghosts of some kind. The end result is a suicide pandemic striking all known urban areas. To the extent that the film focuses on ghosts and computers, it is easy to fault the plot for its lack of continuity and simplistic explanations--and this is really the central problem with the film; not the plot mind you, but the extent to which the film gets side-tracked with expository content that shifts focus away from the individuals struggling with depression and isolation to its devices (ghosts/computers).Minus the ending and superfluous explanations, Pulse is good. And relevant. And really, relevance is what makes it good. It's not tough to spot the growing paradox of ever-increasing connectedness and isolation in our world of text messages, email and mass-produced culture. Pulse uses this paradox and exaggerates, and to a large extent, succeeds in provoking thought and maybe a glimmer of recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulse is dry and stuffy horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pulse is a remake of a 2000 Japanese horror film of the same name, but after seeing the American remake, I am scared to see the original (and not in the way the filmmakers intended). The movie is so dry and lifeless that it is impossible to get anything but a few minor cheap thrills out of it. Whatever feel the director wanted to extract from this dry film whether it be unease or sorrow I do not think he accomplished. These horror filmmakers are not making it loud and bloody, but quiet and dull. Even slasher flicks have more excitement than this dry piece of boredom. It's as if the director and screenwriter Wes Craven think they are making a Hitchcock film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another lame remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLOT OUTLINE: After her hacker boyfriend hangs himself in front of her, psychology student Mattie Webber &amp; her friends start receiving messages from the dead man, as well as seeing ghosts everywhere. Anyone who is exposed to these creatures are infected with a virus that causes them to commit suicide &amp; the whole city is becoming exposed.This is yet another dumbed-down remake of a Japanese horror film. It comes co-written by horror legend Wes Craven &amp; is directed by Jim Sonzero, who has had experience making commercials.While the original PULSE was not that great a film ? it had a plot that was almost impossible to follow, &amp; resembled an art film ? this remake does not come anywhere near it. The reason is, despite a good script, the film's direction left a lot to be desired. Sonzero has a rather limited bag of tricks, which include sped-up motion, flashy cuts &amp; CGI effects. These effects are thrust onto the viewer in the hope that they will be unnerved? yeah right.The central concept of Pulse is an extension of the same technophobia that this reviewer found to be irritating ? we don't need a film which has the message that technology is evil ? there must be someone in Hollywood who thinks that we're better off in the Dark Ages. That said, the idea that soul-sucking ghosts can invade our world through computers &amp; cell phones does have some merit, considering the way our technology seems to be evolving.The acting is passable. Kristen Bell looks pretty but is perhaps the only member in the cast who can act, everyone else being reduced to cardboard cut-outs. There are some notable cameos from Ron Rifkin as Bell's shrink &amp; Brad Dourif, who makes yet another notch in his long belt as a nutty café customer.When it comes to the big question ? is this film scary ? I would have to say that it isn't. Pulse goes through its 84-minute running time on autopilot, without anything interesting to justify the effort taken in making it. The CGI effects are okay but wholly unnecessary. As I said before, the film's message ? that we have become too reliant on computers &amp; cell phones ? is out of place in this modern world.That said, the film does have some things going for it. The script manages to neat trick of explaining the original's plot without becoming ludicrous ? the creatures can be kept at bay by red tape, while Sonzero brings a couple of new shocks to the table. The part where one of the students is attacked by a creature with multiple limbs that comes out of a washing machine; Kristen Bell's computer printing out a number of pages that, when assembled, resemble a skull; several shots of people killing themselves (the scene where a woman climbs onto a water tower &amp; jumps off to her death is slightly disturbing) are these shocks but even they can't enliven the film.At the end of the day, Pulse has its moments, but fails to rise above the routine.</fullReview>

There is no smart plot, the idea has been consumed already and the horror scenes are not scary at all! There are stupid scenes as well like when they try to reach the server at the end to stop the virus, they manage to walk through thousands of ghosts and nothing happens to them! Then she proceeds alone as Dexter fails to follow her and you logically suppose afterwards that he won't make it but miraculously he does! This is just stupid!</fullReview>

I can actually think of this as more of a comedy, so terrible, so painful. Please save your rental money and see something else. Rock Gonzalez and Samm Levine are great actors in general, but the terrible script and sloppy direction makes them seem like they're reading from cue-cards. The overall aura of the film is very dark, maybe too dark...because the viewer gets so used to the darkness all the time, that when it comes time for a scare, a yawn or giggle is the result.</fullReview>

It would have been better if they had explained more about what was happening. The friends well it appears that these films are developing a now you see me now you don't mentality. As someone else said Does nobody care. Now that may be part of the message and maybe if they had gone with that it would have been something. I understood the uncaring attitude of themselves as they resided in squalor, as their lives where no longer theirs. But hey I have seen my sons room in a state such as that and he is very much alive. The ending had potential but then they blew it again. As others have said this movie is not one for the archives. Go get a Japanese horror instead. Cheers Furdion</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is it that the only horror films getting big screen treatment these days are the ones aimed squarely at the teen market? Where are the days when a Re-Animator could lumber into multiplexes unrated and kick some major butt? I long for those days. Then we wouldn't have to put up with stuff like Pulse. I read another post where the writer said that it amounts to a student film trying to put together every creepy image possible. That about sums it up. Pulse tries to be scary but it just isn't. There's a kernel of a plot in there with the dead wanting to get back into our world, but it is lost in endless scenes of someone walking ever so slowly towards a computer screen only to have something jump out at them. Oooo scary. On the bright side, the ghosts do have a nice unique look to them. Its just too bad that they are wasted on a film like this. Do yourself a favour and go see the superior ghost story The Abandoned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicide acts as some kind of disease in this movie. The dead come back and take away the life from the living as punishment. "You didn't see that I was sad, you didn't help me. Now, you die." Anybody who has been through the death of a loved one in that way will recognize and sympathize. It seems like nothing can get through to you, like the slightest mistake will set you in the same direction.Having said that, the movie doesn't deserve that recognition. The whole point of the movie is that the separation is what kills people, but there isn't any connection in this movie, it's too busy killing people in visually interesting ways. Look, someone jumped off the tower! He dissolved into the wall!! And look at at the washing machine with all the limbs hanging out of it!!! Are you scared? The sad thing about this movie is that it is one of the bad guys, it's synthetic and distancing. There is no life or joy in this movie. You can't fake that by having a party girl and one bar scene. Nobody really talks to anybody in this movie and when they make it to the dead zone where all the people are, we see it for a second before we go back to the city and the excitement! This movie is dead and it wants to take you with it.</fullReview>

Although all the movie doesn't tell us too much about the focus or the main idea, it has a especial ingredient for having a good time and not miss even a second. May be the home theater helps but some scenes were made very good, really I almost fell out of my seat in different parts. The acting was OK,and some visual effects were nice, but there was very little suspense.I agree with the ending was not all that great, much better if it'd have had a different one, perhaps, one with more action.

This movie smacks of Wraith: The Oblivion.The basic premise of the movie is a previously unknown frequency of radio waves is discovered. The radio waves are actually the resonance of the dead, the angry dead or something else. Because of this, the dead are able to take notice of us for the first time, where they may not have noticed us before. They 'infect' other frequencies and slowly wear away the walls between our world and theirs.Put the acting aside, put the script aside and pay attention to the plot. This is one of the darkest movies of the last few years because of the premise. Alas they tried to make it into a monster movie instead of making it more like The Mist, they made it more of a "lets stop the bad things" instead of a "how normal people deal with this situation."

		<shortDescription>One of the worst horror movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago when Wes Craven was still attached to direct this American remake of the almost perfect Japanese thriller, I was quite excited to see it. Seeing as Craven had never made a bad movie (except for the Hills Have Eyes sequel, which was taken away from him), I thought it would be great. Unexpectedly, the project was canceled when Bob Weinstein thought it was too similar to THE RING and sent Craven to work on the disastrous CURSED instead. Eventually Weinstein found a way to make a cheaper, ultra dumbed down version of PULSE, completely scraping any intelligence left in Craven's original screenplay (he still maintains a writing credit, which Craven says does not reflect his work). The result is one of the top five worst horror movies ever made. A complete and total insult to anyone who pays money to watch it. This made-for-teens only abomination represents everything that is wrong with the horror genre today: over-explanation to the point of aggravation (the producers must think we are brain-dead as an audience), the casting of pop stars instead of actual actors (Christina Milian), and cookie-cutter editing due the number of times the picture was re-edited and re-shot to get a PG-13 rating. Even Kristen Bell, great on "Veronica Mars", seems bored here. You will be too if you make the mistake of watching this. It's ironic that a movie called PULSE doesn't have one. 0/10.</fullReview>

It seems that the dead are trying to come back by stealing the will and souls of the living. Everywhere there is a communications signal these destructive beings cam enter and live. The present themselves like specters or ghosts and can take almost any form. They stalk the living and take their will and the living eventually disintegrate and become one of the beings. Interesting concept, but the biggest flaw is that eventually the electricity will run out and communications will stop. Another tactic would be an EM pulse to destroy the electronics that allows the entities to move around and live in out realm. Film rating of B+ for originality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake of the Japanese Kairo, which for me is one of the scariest movies of all time. The story is about a how breach between this world and the next is allowing the ghosts to pass over. Both scrupulously faithful to and painfully dismissive of the original film (it either copies scenes verbatim or short circuits them by going in odd directions) this is a film thats neither fish nor fowl. It refuse to be a shot for shot remake but doesn't have the ability to break free of the source and do something unique. The film also comes off as a cliff notes version running some thirty five minutes shorter than the original Japanese film with no real reason since the film is such a close copy. Clearly this is one of those periodic films that (re)writer/producer Wes Craven puts out that makes people wonder why he has such a great reputation. Things aren't helped by the cast which comes off as more than a bit whiny and vapid, speaking lines that never are clearly not coming from their brains. On the plus side the film does possess some great visuals thanks to the need to spell out what was only implied in the original.(If you're looking for images from the trailer be warned that several of them do not appear since they were stolen outright from the original film for sequences in the trailer that do not appear in the finished film.) Unless you are a student of horrific images this is a film to avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond the fact that PULSE is based on an Asian film, it also plays like a cross between THE RING and THE GRUDGE. And the lead actress, Kristen Bell, bears a strong resemblance to Sarah Michelle Gellar and Naomi Watts, which is not the worst thing in the world. Anyhow, beings from another dimension are breaking through into our world via electronic signals. They may be ghosts, they may be aliens, and then again they may be something entirely different, like the creatures in EVENT HORIZON. The apparitions are scary, but the death scenes involve an energy transference, so there's no blood or gore and this is rated PG-13. The CGI work is outstanding, especially in suggesting the rot these creatures spread everywhere as they enter our world. In the end, though, this is a kids' film, with one teen/young adult after another being knocked off in fairly quick succession. In this way, PULSE proved a disappointment. SILENT HILL, with its similar theme of alternate realities/dimensions, was actually more entertaining -- and SILENT HIll was nothing to write home about. Bell is attractive but has a way to go as an actress. She'll get there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into Pulse expecting nothing special, but left with a serious case of the chills. For a Pg-13 movie I was amazed at how scary it was. Although admit I scare fairly easily, I have to say that i spent a good chunk of time watching it between my fingers. A good cast adds to the scare factor, Kirsten Bell's character became a tad annoying at times but managed to get past that and portray some serious spine-chilling terror. Ian Somerhalder has been a rising young star since Lost and continues on the way up. Christina Milian, the well known "Dip It Low" singer gives an unexpectedly eerie performance, and all the other actors portray their roles extremely well also. While fans of blood and gore probably won't go nuts for it, those who enjoy a good creep-fest will be thrilled and chilled. Although it frequently relied on musical build-ups and situations seemed a tad on the extreme side, the movie overall pulled through and came out as what I believe to be one of the scariest movies made in decades. Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

The actors did a great job with there roles, mind you this isn't a Oscar winning film. The sound effects and music add to the bizarre, eerie, and strangeness of the film. This film had a good story about how we(modern America/world)use technology and isolate ourselves and basically self-destroy ourselves for using texts, internet, television etc. And the special effects were good. I've seen so many horror films that this wasn't scary at all for me but it could be different for you and it did build tension especially when there's the "Fake climax" scene which happens right after Mattie gets off the elevator. And Wes Cravens uses Dramatic Irony in the very begging with josh which is an odd and successful effect to put to use in a horror film. The cinematography is good and editing is in top notch firm. Go see this good American remake film. Pulse: You are now infected. There were some frequencies we were never meant to find. 10/10.</fullReview>

No thrills, chills or characters you can care about. You are presented with a group of close friends -- yet no one seems concerned or even to notice that one of their buddies hasn't been around, anywhere, for a few days. No one seems to care when his fate is discovered. For some reason, all the college students seem to reside in apartments with black walls and leave food scattered all over the place to rot. I'm guessing the props dept had a lot of bugs around and wanted to use them up.

It was completely UN-cliché to the endings of most teen horror flicks. The story was great and the acting wasn't that bad. If the acting had been better this would have got a 10. Note to all horror fans - GO SEE THIS!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar to US-"Ring"-Remake, but much weaker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a (horror-)genre-fan then a screening is entertaining, but do not expect too much. Mostly, it's style over substance.The visual effects are good, but not outstanding. The main weak point is the story. The story is - compared to the US-"Ring"-Remake - much weaker, more illogical, confusing and much more worse explained. So, mainly, it lacks a new, genuine idea which could lie beneath the horror. The ghosts and attacks are scary, but unfortunately the background is not, it's just not profound enough.I must say that I'm not a particular fan of Kristen Bell. She is okay in the role, but I'm not enthusiastic about her. The other actors are okay, too.Maybe the alternate ending/deleted scene on the DVD can compensate for the weaknesses of this movie, at least a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst things we have ever produced as a species</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh boy have I waited a long time for this. My hour of revenge is at hand, at last Pulse you will suffer my wrath!!! When wireless technology puts humans into contact with an unstoppable force that's determined to claim the lives of the living for the souls of the damned, it's up to a group of determined teens to close the gate before it's too late in director Jim Sonzero's remake of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's apocalyptic horror classic. A doorway between the human realm and the spiritual realm has been opened, and now the technology that once made humankind the ruler of the planet has become its digital Achilles heel. With every call made and every e-mail checked, life is slowly being stolen from the living and claimed for the dead. With no way of turning off the connection and no means of reasoning with a force they cannot understand, a desperate group of college students must discover a means of stopping the takeover before the entire planet is transformed into a cosmic haunting ground for wayward souls in search of a home. ~ (Jason Buchanan, Rovi) Let me just come out and say it: I have no problem when ghost interact with technology, if it is done well. Granted, I don't think a movie has done it well (Does the Grudge 1 and 2 count?). But this movie is just silly. The movie tries to be all "Preventing the apocalypse" and stopping an invasion from another realm, problem is that that those causing said apocalypse are ghost. Yeah, I'm sorry but am I the only one who thinks the idea of Ghost vs Humanity is the stupidest idea ever?! Zombies I'll buy. Aliens I'll buy. Demons, I'll buy. Ghost however, ghost stories like this are supposed to be small scale. When you try to incorporate the larger picture it kind of fall apart. Here is how it basically is: An army of the Grudge ghost vs the entire human population, military included. Casper is trying to destroy humanity. Completely effin stupid. There are no scares in this movie. Even the jump scares fail miserably, which is kind of pathetic actually. And the acting and script... you know what I'm going to say. But what truly seals this movies fate is the ending. That ending has to be the worst ending I have ever seen in a movie ever. Basically everything that happened in the movie... IT DIDN'T MATTER!!!! I haven't been this furious at a film because of its ending...ever. Like this is everything that an ending should not be. This movie can kiss my funky ass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Avril Lavigne dyes her hair blonde, then watches as her boyfriend opens the gates to internet ghostdom, after which everything turns even more blue than before. The wraiths try their best to be as scary as the ones in "Kairo", the Japanese original, but to no avail. Even Avril doesn't seem quite as scared as she should ought to be.Apparently, the blue-loving undead had been waiting all these millenia for mankind to finally get internet and mobile phones so they can invade us. Why were TVs not good enough? The acting is pretty bad. The low point was one of the movie's numerous amateurs shouting in the blueish-hue streets about WiFis. There is something inherently annoying about a bad actress mentioning WiFis in a mediocre horror film about internet terror.The photography is quite good (I actually love blue movies), but there is no sense in yet another inferior remake of a superior Japanese original. There used to be a time when the Japanese copied just about every aspect of American culture... A role-reversal?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another bad American remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has a habit of making remakes of foreign horror movies these days and most of the time they suck. Pulse is no exception, it's another over the top horror remake that doesn't scare. The original Japaniese movie Kario (Pulse) was a great ghost movie since it was creepy, atmospheric and had a interesting storyline. The ghosts were scary mainly because the didn't rely on over the top GCI to make them work. There was only a small amount used for the ghosts while the rest was live action, that made the creepier because they looked real. The remake uses to much CGI which makes them look fake, it's like American remakes have to throw everything at the audience just to scare them.The ghost effects are good but not scary because they over do it. Another thing the remake overuses is the red tape, in the original the red tape was only used a few times but in the remake it's done too much and it makes the movie seem kind of silly.The acting in this movie is so-so. The plot is loosely based off the original since Kairo focused more on death being lonely while the remake focuses more on computer technology being used to bring the dead into our world. The whole death being lonely is only really mentioned in one scene. I don't really mind if the American remake's plot is kind of different to the original because it does give the movie some originality, if it was identical to Kairo (Pulse) I would have turned it off and just put the original on. I think the main problem with most of these American remakes is that they put more effort into the effects rather than the story. It's a prime example of style before substance.Pulse is another disappointing American remake that's not really worth seeing. I give it three stars only because the ghost effects were kind of cool. If you want to see a better ghost movie watch the original Japaniese version Kairo (Pulse)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Japanese original of this movie was about people fading out because they weren't connecting with others.. It began interestingly, and then gradually trailed off (like a lot of its director's movies), but left behind a distinct feeling of bleak hopelessness, much in the Ingmar Bergman mode.The writer for the remake was Wes Craven, who I'm fairly sure has never been regarded as like Ingmar Bergman. He takes the original and turns it, as far as one could do, into Scream: four American teens (or teenlike persons) suddenly find themselves playing I Didn't Survive a Japanese Horror Movie.To the original bleak idea, Craven adds a boffo topper: dead zombie-ghosts are Breaking Through The Breach. Hey, just like in H. P. Lovecraft! But wait a minute - haven't I seen that movie before? Like three or four times? Evidently everybody realized this, so they don't bother to keep the audience in suspense about it: as their very first scene, they have a guy running from zombie ghosts, who he keeps getting flash visions of. We don't know who he is or or what they are - well, actually, we do, from They Live, Flatliners, Nos Miran, etc. - but not from this movie. However, we have now seen what we're going to see in the rest of it and feel we don't need to watch it any further. And we're even more right than we know, because most of the rest of the movie consists of variants of that same scene repeated over and over.Such scenes can be scary - and _were_ scary in those other movies I mentioned, which weren't so great themselves. But to be scared, the viewer has to be involved, and has to be surprised. Here you're not, for just about every possible reason.First of all, you know what's coming, because each ghost scene is just the same as the last one and you can predict where the next is going to occur. I'll sit naked in my bath now! I'll do my laundry in the creepy laundry room! (Why do laundry rooms in horror movies look like Halloween spook houses?) Then, there's no suspense of the don't-open-that-door kind: the flash visions can come at any time, and be of anything. And when they do come, you can't tell what the **** you're looking at: the shots are staged and cut in in such a way that you don't know exactly where the zombie-ghosts are, or exactly what they're doing, and so you don't know what you're supposed to be scared of. Finally, they're just special effects: creepy make-ups, shot flickeringly, like video. The ghost in Ringu was scary because she _came out_; she wouldn't have been so scary as a broadcast transmission.The other big problem with the movie is, it's not a movie; it's TV. To be exact, it's like an episode of Supernatural, with Veronica Mars as the guest lead - actually the same actress, still playing basically the same character. Watching her at this length, I realized she's just a second-string Sarah Michelle Gellar; if it were a radio play, she'd _be_ Sarah Michelle Gellar. So the movie is also like an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, without jokes. For two hours, you're watching young TV actors doing TV soap acting, employing the same stock readings and stock reactions you've seen over and over; you might as well be watching their audition videos. The script gives them no characters to play outside the minimum the scenes require, and the actors add nothing to that. And they don't even have the attractiveness we're used to from TV soaps: they're shot in desaturated color, to give the movie a creepy feel, and so they all look pasty and dead.Then, there's the music. It is in fact horror music, and might make a good CD for playing on Halloween. But it's laid on almost irrespectively of what it accompanies: although nothing is happening, it blares on and on, letting us know how how scared we should be - and probably would be, if the scenes were doing what they were supposed to.In a movie of this kind, the fact that the story doesn't truly make sense almost goes without saying. What's more lacking here, I believe, and what ultimately undoes the movie, is the sensibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Argh i hate it when they make an absolutely fantastic trailer for a film...then the film turns out CRAPOLA - this keeps happening to me.I was sceptical about this film so i did a quick look on the net and saw the trailer on youtube and it looked bloody brilliant but it really wasn't all that.I will admit some bits are jumpy and i hid behind my eyes like twice but thats about it. It was a very wes craven film...rubbish basically.Another this that did me in was the tone of the film. The obviously were trying to create a dull techno atmoshpere and it backfired. By the end of the film in was practically black and white...i know this sounds weird but it really was!!!! Wasn't suttle at all.As for the story there was something missing and it all seemed a bit too fast and not enough was really explained. They were too ambitious with the storyline and i think thats where it went all wrong. Maybe if Kirsten Dunst was in it like she was supposed to it could have been a bit better.Don't watch it save your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a trend that should have ended with the first one.This was boring and self-conscious with its artsy pretensions. I was looking all around at the scenery to see if I could tell where it was filmed rather than paying too much attention to the story. Still, I didn't miss anything.I'm not surprised that this is from producer Wes Craven. It's full of his anti-technology hippie ideals, with plenty of nonsensical "movie science" that teens and pre-teens will take as fact.Of course, all of the technology being slammed here as detrimental to our existence by removing in-person interactions, are being used fully by all those making this tripe, including Craven himself, and by the blank-minded ones who will love this and not even realize the irony that it comments on their technology addiction.I'm also sick of all the grays, sickly-looking greens and putrid blues used in these type of films to present the civilized, yet oppressive, society, along with the grungy, unclean characters with pale faces and dark eyes under constant fluorescent lighting. Cities don't look like this, there is color and life all around, even in the poorest areas. This film's view is the misguided angst of rebellious teens with nothing to rebel against.And then we are treated to Craven's simplistic Waltons-like ending that, once you go rural, you are colorful and clean. Here's a suggestion, Wes Craven, why don't you go rural and give up all your non-personal technology, so that we don't have to see any of your productions again?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ho hum. Another scary movie with dull occurrences that results in a cowardly and unimaginative ending. Maybe the ending is meant as a message to mankind regarding its usage and dependence upon the internet and its devices, or maybe it is just to leave an opening for a sequel. Personally I think it is unoriginal and lame. Too many scary movies these days lay open a path for a sequel, and it is really ridiculous considering that the movies are so bad, who'd want to see a sequel?There was no real explanation as to what the creatures in this movie were or where they came from. Were they supposed to be aliens or souls from another realm? On top of that, it was hard to tell whether they were ghost type beings with bodies that couldn't be touched or physical tangible beings that could be shot, killed, or kicked (as one was at the end). In the end the movie failed to trigger any real emotions other than apathy. The evidence is in the fact that I'm writing a review online right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another average teen horror movie. It set the characters up for stupid scenes where something loud and annoying popped out at the character. Honestly though, the director put the characters in a good spot for a gory or violent scene, but it had to be a pg-13 movie I guess. The atmosphere was great, always dark, a helpless feel, but other than that it sucked. From now on I'm only watching R Rated horror movies, because this, The Ring and the Grudge were big letdowns.- I do say though that the acting was farely well, and that the original version the Japanese one looks much better.

		<fullReview>I just finished watching Pulse and I have to admit I am fairly disappointed. The trailer looked good to me and I was looking forward to something similar to The Ring et cetera. At the beginning the movie looked promising in that aspect, although not really original, it just seemed to be The Ring moved to computers. But somehow every small bit of the thin plot that is revealed makes the thing worse.After the rather interesting premise of some sort of "wraiths" being able to get to us through our computer networks the movie goes on to explain that red duct tape repels those creatures... red duct tape? couldn't they think of anything better as a simple defense against those things? Something that has even a slight logical relation to the things happening?In the first half of the movie it seems that only people are killed / kill themselves that watch some kind of video stream, so you got something like a haunted video story again. Somewhere in the last half of the movie it suddenly begins to depict some sort of apocalyptic setting where those ghosts randomly kill everybody, which leads to the ending that our technology is our doom. They even made the heroine say some cheesy prophetic lines at the end about that. Kind of reminded me of Terminator.One thing I found odd is that the heroine herself doesn't do much in the whole movie. All she does is watch her friends die and scream along. The only thing she really does is make another guy investigate while she has more or less creepy confrontations with the ghosts while being on the toilet, taking a bath or sleeping. The results of the investigation led by that guy are not really clear, except for that vague "some guy researched some new broadband transmission technology and meanwhile stumbled across those things". That researcher btw was by far the weakest performance in the whole movie, which for me completely spoiled the whole "explanation" part of the movie.The last confrontation with these "wraiths" is downright ridiculous. I would have expected that someone knowing that there are ghost-like beings out there to kill you that can get to you through every kind of network you can imagine would ditch his cell phone _instantly_, especially when everyone you would like to call is dead anyway, but somehow that must have slipped the mind of our heroine while they were fleeing from the city to get as far away from any computers as possible. So aside from doing nothing effectively she's also stupid.Conclusion: Starts like The Ring, leaves out the background story, doesn't even try to explain the ghosts and then somehow switches to an "all people with technology die" apocalypse setting that completely neglects the video stream thing they were focusing on for the first half of the movie. Boring for the bigger part, confusing for the rest of it, with only one good scare (the ghost coming out of the laundry machine).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to this movie, if you ever want to stop ghosts from coming into your room from electrical devices, cover all walls and windows with red tape. That makes a lot of of sense doesn't it? And that's the main problem with this film is that there are too many instances of the plot making little sense.There were some good scenes that will make you jump. But the whole idea of ghosts coming through the computer and phones and sucking the life out of someone was too silly. And to stop this the answer is to release a computer virus. The movie never explained how dead people were trapped in the computer and could watch the living and eventually come through the wires. Plus, the writers came up with red tape as the way to stop the ghosts. Just to far out there for my tastes.FINAL VERDICT: Not a very good horror film. No blood and the plot is too out there.</fullReview>

A lot of the original movie never made the final cut (go figure) which makes it suffer (watch the bonus material if you rent it) The 2006 version has some decent acting, but no actor can carry a piece that isn't worth acting in, the movie just can't carry your interest for longer than 45mins since there is a problem with the screenplay adaptation. If the ghosts come thru technology then why would everyone still be retaining their gadgets aka Mattie? Also, how does red tape stop a ghost who walks thru walls or elevator shafts? The movies was just too short in material to make into a horror flick. I found myself "soul less" in continuing to watch so I turned away in time but went to my laptop to look for better movies. Surprisingly I waited but no ghosts arrived!</fullReview>

It seems to be a recent trend of the past few years to remake any 70's horror or any of the recent Japanese offerings that film makers can get their greasy little unimaginative hands on. One thing they are good for is making you realise how good the original is. This movie fell flat on it's face in the scare stakes. I didn't feel scared once. Try watching 'The Eye' by the Pang Brothers if you want to experience real fear. The acting is terrible, the plot is ridiculous. Since when has some red tape stopped anyone, let alone some ghosts or whatever they are supposed to be. The pre-credit ending tries to be really dramatic but just turns out like a load of cheese. I almost laughed. You could probably get through it if you really have nothing better to do, but i'd advise against it. Good job it's only 90 minutes long is all i can say. That's long enough.

		<fullReview>I rented this movie off of On Demand, and despite a few really crappy effects, I found Pulse to be a pretty good movie.The movie had some true fact linked to it. Basically it emphasizes a reality that computers are actually becoming stronger than their users. The fastest computer today can actually process faster than can the human brain. If the computer is capable of this, then it very well could be that they could advance to becoming even more powerful.One of the things that I disliked about this movie is that a few of the effects were pretty bad. The crashing plane scene was the fakest explosion that I have ever seen in my entire life. Despite this scene, the effects get maybe a 7 out of 10.This movie left you hanging at the end, and I am 99.9% sure that there is going to be a Pulse 2. We'll just have to wait and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And boy did I still not like it...When I see Wes Craven's name stuck on something, I'm generally expecting to develop a nagging groin pain and some intestinal cramping, it's what Craven does. I recall at one point thinking he's made a good movie in the past, but to be honest, I can't remember what it was anymore. He only produces this, not that it changes anything.Like every horror movie that was released by a studio in the last decade, not only did this movie suck, blow and lick, it just didn't make a lot of sense. Have a seat and I'll run you through some of the awesomeness.As a recurring chunk of the movie, these otherworldly, pasty, ghostly dudes keep popping up to suck the faces off whoever happens to be around. Which I guess is fine, but why are they such jerks? First, are they even ghosts or some kind of extra dimensional high frequency wi-fi demons? I don't know, but meh, I'll get over that and still wonder...why are they jerks? Why do you throw wet laundry out of the machine first...then leap out all contortionist-like and suck the will to live out of Christina Milian? Or why toss books around in that dank, dank, DANK library to get the attention of that foolish kid at the beginning? Speaking of dank, why couldn't the production team get a swear jar together or something to pool funds for a couple of 60 watt bulbs? The 40's they used throughout the entire movie really weren't helping me out much. I thought my brain might be giving up on me or my retinas were detaching in an effort to seek stimulation elsewhere.I enjoyed the way the director so slyly gave us shot after shot after shot...after shot, of people using cell phones and PDA's and laptops. Oh no, we're a society so reliant on this technology and even when with others we distance ourselves from them with this technological over-saturation. Whatever could it all mean?? It's so friggin subtle!I'm all for idiotic story telling, but the moment you put on a big sandwich board sign that says "Hey, I'm an idiot and I don't know what's going on," your story suffers a little bit. Such was the case with red tape, accompanied by the note to the effect of "this stops them, I don't know why." Dude, I dunno why either. And since it's a significant plot point, maybe someone could work on a why. All I got was a sketchy character introduced in the last 15 minutes who guesses about it blocking frequencies. Which makes even less sense. Jerk ghost/demon/pale kids have a frequency that doesn't mesh with red tape? What the hell does that even mean? I want to grab every character in this movie and shake them until they get whiplash.I'm gonna be honest, I was a little tired by the end of this, so maybe I lost some of the monumental meaning or whatever. But what the hell was that? Come on! Let's download this virus and get...system overload? Yeah, I get that warning on my PC all the time. Then the system reboots and the ghosts come back and even though we already decided nothing was going to happen thus making the last like 45 minutes of this movie pointless we tried anyway and look, nothing happened so let's run away but I'm gonna keep my stupid cell phone and we're just gonna stop the truck in the middle of nowhere and have a nap!!! A NAP?? Oh yes, then a voice over monologue about the end of the world.Wait, what? No seriously...what?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I sat down to see this movie, I had pretty low expectations, and as it turns out, they where justified. The original Japanese film, although not a very good movie, is probably the film that has scared me most these last few years, the first 35-40 mins simply scared the living crap out of me, I don't know why. This remake however, did no such thing, only one scene came close to making me feel unsettled, and thats the scene when Stone goes over to Josh's apartment, and the pale lady slowly walks out of the shadows and towards him, that was a good scene. The rest of the film is just a Mich-mash of stereotypes, clichés and bad acting. I would not recommend anyone to buy this on DVD, but if you are a horror movie buff like myself, then it might be worth spending 90 minutes or so on a windy night, watching this movie on TV and eating popcorn. I would also like to mention that I'm in no way a "all remakes suck ass" kind of guy, in many cases(my prime example being The Ring) the remake exceeds the original by far, but this was not one of those remakes I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pulse" (2006) Directed By: Jim Sonzero Starring: Kristen Bell, Ian Somerhalder, Christina Milian, Rick Gonzalez, Jonathan Tucker, &amp; Sam Levine MPAA Rating: "Unrated" (for intense sequences of sci-fi terror, disturbing images, language, sensuality and thematic material)***PLEASE NOTE: This Is A Review Of The "Unrated" Version Of The Movie*** If there was ever a mixed-up horror movie, "Pulse" is most definitely it. I have such mixed feelings about this film, starting with, of course, the fact that it is a remake of a Japanese horror film released only five years ago. Why can't American audiences just read subtitles? Why do we need a remake of nearly every foreign movie released? "Pulse" also overloads on the cheesy special effects, eliminating any true fear we may have felt for the ghouls and ghosts that haunt the various scenes. On top of that, there are no truly solid scares and the pacing is almost numbingly slow. However, with all of that said, "Pulse" does sport a bleak, cheerless setting that is perfectly depressing, as well as likable characters that are not the typical, clichéd stereotypes (okay, some are, but most are not). I also adored the underlying message of the downfall of society brought on by the overuse of electronics...sure, it was borrowed from its superior predecessor, but this remake does capture this symbolism as well.Mattie Webber (Bell) is a typical college student who is devastated when her boyfriend, Josh (Tucker), commits suicide. A few days later, Mattie and her friends receive a message from Josh?in a chat room. As students and people everywhere begin to either vanish or commit suicide, terrifying occurrences begin to plague Mattie and her friends. They discover that dark forces are invading the world through the wires and that the forces rob their victims of the will to live and, if they do not kill themselves, they will simply decompose completely into a pile of thick, black ash. Mattie and her friends, including Izzy (Milian) and Dexter (Somerhalder), must now race to save the world before the spirits overtake it and the world as we know it is completely demolished. "Pulse" could have easily been a chilling, haunting pre-apocalyptic tale. It could have easily been one of the most effective horror movies of the decade?but it's not--plain and simple. "Pulse" is just not. It's a mediocre horror movie, plagued by excessive use of CGI and virtually no scares. What happened? Even this "Unrated" cut fails to maximize on its terror. The added scenes of violence (okay, the single scene of added violence) centers around a character we do not know and who we never truly see. What could have been a moment of disturbing shock, became a moment of?well, not much really.The performances in "Pulse" are nothing to scream about, but they aren't necessarily bad. Kristen Bell does a nice job. Was she as good as Sarah Michelle Gellar in "The Grudge" or Naomi Watts in "The Ring", no, but she handles herself decently. Ian Somerhalder kind of wandered around aimlessly for the most part. Why couldn't they just kill him off early and be done with it? His character was flatter than a pancake. Christina Milian did everything she could, but, like Somerhalder, was given a nothing part. She didn't really do anything. Rick Gonzalez suffered from the same problem. He was wasted on a two-dimensional part that existed solely to add another body to the pile. Obviously, the filmmakers thought that, as long as heaps of college students get killed, then the movie would be disturbing and actually scary. Unfortunately, they forgot to make said college students people we actually cared about. I found myself strangely detached when someone was killed. That's not a good thing.When "Pulse" ended, I felt nothing--not an ounce of caring or interest, but I also didn't dislike it and that's something. This movie is not bad, but it isn't necessarily good. It somehow falls into a dead spot right in the middle. There was no spark whatsoever. The performances are passable. The script is average. The special effects are patchy. The ending seems a little tacked on. The scares are also just the usual same old thing (not a good thing). I just don't know what to say about this movie. I can't honestly say that you shouldn't see it, but I also can't tell you not to see it. Overall, "Pulse" is just an average movie, not groundbreaking and instantly forgettable, but not bad. When deciding whether or not this movie is worth it, it really is all in the eye of the beholder. Recommending it or not doing so would not be the responsible thing for me to do, because, when everything was said and done, "Pulse" was just typical Hollywood. But, is that enough to warrant a watch? Final Thought: Does "Pulse" have a pulse? You decide.Overall Rating: 5/10 (B-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulse makes heartbeat stop with boring plot, cheap scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Want to meet a ghost?" displays on the computer screen to the cast of the new movie "Pulse." No, no I don't. Please go away, and take your movie with you. "Pulse" is the latest lame PG-13 we-want-to-draw-in-teenagers-to-make-more-money horror movie to come out. Starring Kristen Bell ("Veronica Mars"), Ian Somerhalder ("Lost") and Christina Millian, the movie surrounds a group of college friends and the strange images they see through their computers. Mattie's (Bell) boyfriend Josh has committed suicide out of nowhere. Suspicious, Mattie and her group of college friends investigate Josh's "suicide." Well, sort of; they really just talk about his death and don't really do anything. Searching for Josh's computer, Mattie finds out it was taken by a mechanic named Dexter (Somerhalder) and tracks him down at his shady apartment in a bad neighborhood. Because, as you know, we all search for thieves in bad neighborhoods without telling the cops. When Mattie catches up with Dexter, he tells her that there are strange occurrences on Josh's CPU, and the two begin to investigate. "Do you want to meet a ghost?" pops up, and when clicking yes, they see images of people who look dead or lifeless being killed or having creepy creatures stalk them in the background. One of them ends up being Josh, and the group of friends freak out. The computer scenes start out freaky, but just end up being annoying by the end. Anyway, it is soon discovered that the dead are jealous of the living, so they decide to come out of computers and electronic devices to steal the living's souls. What? One by one, Mattie's friends start to disappear. The rest of the friends, like earlier, just talk about them missing and never really look for them. As Mattie soon finds out, and remembers about Josh, when one of the dead steal your soul, you first start out with black bruises, then eventually decompose and sometimes even get sucked into the wall? OK. Eventually they find out that the dead can be stopped in two ways. Your first choice is to go to a location that has no cell phone service or computers -- so really either going to the country or below the Mason Dixon line. Of course, they wouldn't think about destroying computers or cell phone towers?. The other way they can be stopped is by surrounding all the doors and windows with red tape. Why does the red tape stop them? Don't worry, it's never explained. Even the ending is awful. The two main characters, Mattie and Dexter, of course find the computer where the virus first started. They shut down the computer and it restarts, making the scene pointless and frustrating. I guess destroying the computer wouldn't make sense. The movie is completely awful. Kristen Bell is hot, but that might be the only thing that was positive about this movie. Why would the dead steal souls through electronic devices? Nothing in the movie is ever really explained so the audience understands. The movie is basically just used for cheap scares and to earn the almighty dollar. Also, the group of friends that hang out reminds me of a bad "Saved by the Bell" cast. You have the hot girl and hot new boyfriend, the sassy black girl, the nerd and the gangster afro guy. When have you ever seen these kinds of people hang out? The correct answer is never. The movie becomes an apocalypse-type of movie with the whole world being taken over by the dead and the main character ending with the "we must live on" speech. Vomit. Basically, if you spend or have spent the money to rent this movie, I am sorry. If you bought this movie, please do not submit to this section. Your opinion on movies has no value here. "Pulse" is a terrible movie. See, even the title doesn't make sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2006 "Pulse" is a remake of the original Kurosawa film by same name. This version, penned in part by horror great Wes Craven) stays away (for good reasons) from the Japanese ghost myths that inspired the original. I say "good reasons" because it would be a formidable challenge for a westerner to transmit the same sense of dread, uncertainty, and unease that permeates movies like "Pulse", the "Ringu" series, "Ju-on", "One Last Call" series, etc. The premise of the American version is simple: just like in medieval Europe, when people lived shoulder-to shoulder, and plagues spread like wildfire, our far more antiseptic world is nonetheless characterized by the multiple connectivities we maintain with other humans (via the wired, wi-fi, etc.), in on-line chat rooms, or by simply staring at the world through the boob tube. While alienated from the physical bodies of others, we are intimately connected by the sinews of fiber-optic, and the ethereal (and ephemeral) neurons of wireless. Thus, unlike the Dark Ages when one had to "Reach Out and Touch Someone" in the flesh, we now are capable of this, and hence spreading our malaise, by remote control. Anywhere in the world - just try that in 1211 AD. "Pulse" shows the apocalyptic outcome of just such an eventuality ? the digital plague blooming like madness in the gardens of our technosavy world. The story line here is actually much closer to "One Last Call" the than the original movie.It is a standard "eye candy" set up. Cool, hip teenagers feverishly tap at the computer keyboards and phone touch pads trying to score, steal phone service, and download the latest (fill in the blank). Unknown to them, and rest of us a communications researcher Ziegler and his team stumble upon "something" in the ultra-wide wi-fi. A hacker named Josh unwittingly releases the menace by hacking Ziegler's servers. And it is coming. Just like the original, the ghostly apparitions turn their victims into dust and ash, after a suitably agonizing period of essentially rotting from inside out. There is nowhere to run except away from all the glittering knickknacks of modern science and technology. The film was atmospherically shot in Romania where the prefabricated grey hues of the Ceausescu- cum-Stalinist architecture helps create the constant and oppressive sense of dread. The theme is Luddite, but not to extreme. As Brad Douriff, appearing in a wonderful cameo, rants: "We broadcast to everyone where we are, and we think we are safe???" It is all too real, as many unwise found themselves in peril after stumbling on a predator on-line. The point is, while the latter cruise playgrounds and summer camps, the weight of statistics is heavily against an on-line junkie; there are many more "digital" eyes watching you on the Web.Some criticize this movie as being simplistic. True, it doesn't ponder the universal themes of friendship, alienation, and soul-searching inherent in the Japanese originals. However, let's be honest, the originals appeal to a narrower slice of the audience, they are more art-house than multiplex. And, they are slow and cerebral (just recall the simulation running in the computer labs of the original film, of the souls that die should they get either too close or stay apart too long). This movie simply shows that our penchant for easily accessible "multiple partners" and digital "soul mates" can be both a blessing and a huge curse should something decide to invite itself for a ménage a trois (or is it ménage a trop beau-coup?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable but scary nevertheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think this was too bad considering the scores it had received, so when I put it on, I continued with my housework. Whilst the beginning was more than a little confusing, I was about to turn it off when it started to get better. Without the background music and the darkened cinematography, this would be pretty similar to the usual 'good looking and young American adult' type horror and has similarities to a few other hacker horror films, but there are plenty of edge-of-your-seat moments as you get into it. It is about someone who hacks into computer systems and hacks into "the wrong one". Then anybody who gets involved mysteriously becomes entwined into the computer system with deadly consequences. I can't say any more without spoiling it, but if you choose to watch this film, stick it out past the first ten minutes and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even worth on cable at 3am</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the preview of this movie I was intrigued and waited until it was out on DVD so I could rent it. Despite the number of people who told me that it was a horrible movie I was still not convinced but I was deterred from renting it. Then, when I'd finally made up my mind to rent the movie it came out on cable and I eagerly got ready one evening to sit down and hopefully enjoy a creepy flick that most have not.Unfortunately for me this time most of the critics were dead on with their views. This is a terrible movie with all the clichés you can imagine- actors going alone in a dark, creepy place, the tortured pretty lead, the so called lead hero who's got the "bad" boy image and at the same time being a hacker/computer expert...Kristen Bell is terrible- she looks and acts like a two bit version of Sarah Michelle Gellar, who's no princess herself, and I was wishing that she had been the first victim. The movie was so bad I had to stop it a quarter of the way through and am going have to get really desperate in order to continue it.All in all, if you haven't got anything better to do...then get cracking and find something because this movie is definitely not worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie after drinkin' three days in a row, in a small paranoia, and I was scared. And it's all thanks to the mood of this movie. I like the feeling in this movie when things start to evolve from tragedy to ...well...no spoilers here. The ghosts are near unique in this movie. The places that they appear aren't that unique except in the end of the film. The mood in the cities after the halfway of the movie is very creepy. The growing despair and ...still no spoilers here.. is acted well by the extras, but not very well by the main characters. When the ghosts do what they do, it's made well. It really looks nasty without gore.All in all, I enjoyed this movie in a hangover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will first admit, I have not seen the original Kairo, so i cannot compare, and maybe if I had seen the original Kairo, I might think differently about Pulse.Was it great? No, was it Horrible? No, was it watchable with some cool effects with some great mood and atmosphere? yes. Could the story have been more developed? Yes! Was the ending amazing and cool, and oh my god I have to see this movie again? No. Is it better then The Ring 2, I know what you did last summer 1 &amp; 2, Motor home Massacre, and many other pathetic sequels, remakes, and first timers? YES! Is it better then a lot of the greats like Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm street, Seven, 28 Days later, The Ring part 1? No, could it have been something special? yes, was it? No. Is it worth a watch on a Friday night with your boyfriend or girlfriend so the two of you can snuggle in the dark for a good spook! yes!Motor home massacre received a rating of 2.7, Pulse received a rating of 3.9, folks rent Motor Home massacre. And you might change your mind about Pulse. 6/10 for pulse. Not great! Not bad, but a fun spook for a Friday night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a zombie-movie feeling to it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is in my opinion clearly underrated even if it does have some drawbacks and problems. Thing is however - it's a horror movie! And it does create a scary atmosphere and give you a good scare just like you want it too! So it does deliver the goods so to speak. The effects are quite good and the actors are also unusually good, some of the supporting actors in particular. The plot-idea is interesting but the movie itself is sometimes a bit incoherent as if it was cut too short perhaps.So why only a five out of ten? This movie is very gloomy and gray - it is shot that way, with very little color in it. That's OK. That's just fine. But after a while you get annoyed at people who's apparently never heard of light-switches! They will walk into any dark apartment, room, tunnel, closet, whatever without ever turning any lights on whatever! After a while it is so obvious it starts to annoy you. They don't just "not turn the lights on" - they'll do anything to avoid doing so! =) Another problem I had with this movie was the the fact that the "things" actually should have been able to catch who-ever they were chasing on numerous occasions and didn't. There are major logical tears in the plot which are hard to ignore. Another - minor - drawback was the main actress or character who's behavior I felt was a little stiff and sometimes even unnatural at some occasions. I don't know if it is the script or the actress who is to blame though.But all things considered I got a good scare out of this one, and the movie actually built up an atmosphere that strongly resembles some of the better zombie-movies I've seen. Without the logical drawbacks in the plot and with the light allergy taken care of I probably would have given this movie an eight instead! See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulse unrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone that saw Pulse in the theater and didn't like it, i recommend that you buy the unrated DVD because they add in all the deleted scenes that weren't shown in theaters. Do you remember seeing a scene of a person jumping off of a tower in the trailer for the PG-13 version? Do you remember not seeing that in the movie? Yea well they put that scene back in the unrated version and i have to say that its one of the coolest things i've ever saw in a movie. They also add some other cool scenes that weren't in theaters. Overall, the unrated version wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't the best movie i've ever seen in my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie started off OK with some good scares (the bath scene) but by 30 minutes in the film made no real sense no continuity in the hauntings and deaths of the protagonists all of whom were forgettable. Sub par acting throughout Christina Milian should stick to singing and looking good cause shes good at both but acting isn't her bag at all. By an hour into the film people were disappearing into ash or dying via suicide left right and centre, let me point out by the hour stage my eyelids were heavy and i eventually let sleep take over, my housemates assured me there was little point watching the remaining 20 or so minutes as it was more of the same.All in all poor and who ever is quoted as saying 'the most scary film of the year' on the box cover is either A. a liar or 2. a five year old girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Very, very minor spoiler... don't worry, it's pretty safe.) Everybody is giving this movie such bad reviews! I'm not just saying this to cause a disturbance, but I really thought it wasn't half bad. Sure, there were a few unrealistic things, say, the cat in the closet or the maggots in the refrigerator. But altogether I thought this movie was scary enough to earn at least an 8/10. I thought that Kristen Bell did a good job at acting scared, and Christina Milian surprised me with her good acting, because, not to be stereotypical, but a lot of singers-turned-actors aren't the best. I say, if you want a good amount of scary surprises that don't leave you nervous afterword, give this one a look. It's pretty interesting, and the plot isn't too confusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Story - Inspired and Taken Seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first fifteen minutes we put up with Wes Craven's usual setup of teenage (in this case, college level) characters acting their age, and so I was hesitant about Pulse. A few months ago I also saw the original version with subtitles, and although the story was amazing I found its pace too slow to stick with. In this version, however, there is the same dark and brooding atmosphere, but with a pace that kept me watching past the introduction of the characters. From there the plot thickened almost immediately, and I will say no more lest I spoil it for those of you who are checking here to see if it is worth watching. Pulse takes its subjects seriously (think all the good things about White Noise meets the Boogeyman meets They) and does not cross over into the ridiculousness that many of today's horror movies do (as in over the top CGI or silly events that completely ruin one's suspension of disbelief). Although I would change a few things (why does it have to be twenty-somethings who stumble on the Pulse secret? Not that I have a problem with that, only that so many movies use this age group in order to attract a younger audience and in so doing often are taken less seriously by older viewers). Example: if they were to remake John Carpenter's The Thing (one of my favourites) today, they would NEVER use the age of men that they did in the original. In my opinion, seeing the cast of Friends in Outpost 31 fighting aliens would just not have the same impact as the adult men used in the original. Anyway, Pulse speeds forward into what was for me a totally unexpected plot direction (doom and gloom and end o the world) and I thought it was an excellent ride. As I have said in so many of my other reviews, today's horror movies, for the most part, are garbage and are only vehicles for potential pop stars and advertisers. Every now and then a movie like Pulse comes along and, mostly, does a good job of telling a good story. WATCH it, and see if you ever look at your computer the same again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alternative to The Ring and a derivative from an Asian production Kairo, this movie survives if looked at as a standalone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pulse revolves around an alternative dimension into which several people made a connection when they came upon a new wireless frequency. What they came upon wasn't nice and for some reason it started spreading through electronics like a virus, entering the real world and stealing everyone's soul one by one, destroying the body in the process. Before you know it, the whole world is in danger.The movie finds its routes in a Japanese production, originally called Kairo. There are a lot of complaints from the viewers of Kairo, condemning Pulse to be a total copycat of that movie, except the Hollywood version is not nearly as artistic and scary as the original. Having never seen Kairo, I can not take that possibility into account while judging.As a standalone, Pulse has got to be one of the creepiest movies ever. The reason for that probably lies in the new monster. Humans have a lot of material fears with clear borders that the movie makers often take advantage of. The last time artificial intelligence took over machines and rebelled against humans, it resulted in a practical and understandable Terminator, a machine that can be seen, understood in English and destroyed with guns. However, the fear factor jumps through the roof when people are introduced to something scary that they can't really mentally grasp or deal with. In Pulse it is the 21st century's technology that's exploited for the sake of horror entertainment.The storyline never goes too deep, probably not to raise unnecessary questions that would obviously shake the storyline's foundation and common sense in general, or perhaps the makers had to watch the length of the movie carefully for budget reasons. Whatever the reason, some parts of the story are left unexplained and the obvious lack of an ending leaves plenty of space for a sequel.There is no spectacular acting (or really good actors for that matter) in the movie, but then again, the movie relies on silence and special effects much more than on talking.Special effects are mostly along the lines of The Grudge and The Ring. They consist out of unnatural (and thus scary) blurs, camera speedups, slowdowns, morphs, and pale naked skinheads crawling out of washing machines.Conclusion:Apart from an empty ending, which obviously leaves plenty of space for sequels, the movie is interesting and worth watching, especially for a Ring fan. Higher than average acting and special effects pull this dark production through just fine. Perhaps not nearly as good as the original, but for a Western viewer this should be a more than satisfying Hollywood adoptation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend rented this movie and we all went to her house to watch it. And I'm glad she rented it because if i saw it in theaters I probably would have walked out. The movie was awful! Every thing was so dark, I know its a scary movie and its supposed to be dark and scary but it just wasn't. It made me mad when they knew something was following them but they still never turned on a light. Not to mention the movie wasn't even a bit scary. Honestly if their going to make a scary movie, then make one thats good not something that sucked as much as this one did! The character Maddie Webber was the worst of them all. She already watched that Do You Want To See a Ghost thing on a different computer, and she got freaked out and told that guy to turn it off. But when it came on her computer she acted like she has never see it before and she clicked on it. All her friends clicked on it and thats just one of the reasons that made this movie stupid. So I give that movie a 1 because it SUCKED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pulse is a thriller along the guidelines of "White Noise" which starred Michael Keaton.i did enjoy White Noise,but I thought Pulse was a bit better at the thrilling aspects.Basically,the premise of Pulse is that dead spirits have found a way to break through the barrier between their world and ours and have taken over all our communication networks ans begun taking over people's bodies and infecting them with a deadly virus in order to eliminate the human race and take control.Kristen Bell,of Veronica Mars fame,plays the heroin in the movie and does a very convincing job in the role.i should mention that White Noise is much narrower in its scope.it does deal with spirits,but there no is subplot involving spirits taking over the world.Anyway,i hope i haven't said too much.both movies are great.it just depends on your taste.White Noise is more suspenseful and Pulse is more of a thriller,though each contains both elements.anyway pulse gets a strong 7* out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Bad As I Was Expecting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I never saw KAIRO (the original Japanese film that was re-made as PULSE here in the States) - so I give no comparisons to that film. All I can really say is that this was one of those "I-don't-know-what-to-rent" rentals, and as such - I figured PULSE would suck balls. Turns out, it was relatively entertaining which was more than I was hoping for.A computer-hacking post-teen lets loose a strange "force" when he hacks into the database of a team doing research on alternate bandwidths (or some such other nerdy sh!t...). The things that are released are a sort of ghost that materialize to suck your soul out and use things like computers, cell-phones, PDA's, etc...as their means of "transportation". Soon a whole town and eventually the world is infected and effected by these bizarre spirits, and a few other kids are out to stop the spreading threat...A pretty ridiculous premise, but I felt it worked well enough in this one. it seems that since such films as RINGU, and PHONE, and a few others - there is an upswing in techno-horror based on common technological advances. I don't see any problem with this as mankind is always afraid of progress and change, so horror films based on this type of change is bound to happen. Anyway - PULSE is nothing ground-breaking by any means, but it starts off quick and never really lets up, so the pacing is decent. The atmosphere of the film is dark and the apocalyptic ending worked for me too. Again, this isn't a great film by any means, but I found it far more entertaining than I was expecting. I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to check it out - but if there's nothing else of interest at the ol' vid-store, go ahead and give this one a look - I've done far worse with blind-picks...7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this complex and interesting movie, Kristen Bell (best known as Veronica Mars) plays Mattie. Along with her friends, Mattie's computer comes infected by a virus which can travel any where, where there is a WiFi connection or mobile signal. This virus Kills! The Movie is amazingly complex and different to your average horror movie, with a strong lead, along with its differentiating aspects make it an amazing movie. Along with the Fantastic Kristen Bell, Christina Millian plays Mattie's best friend who encounters the virus through her computer."Pulse" is a remake of "Kairo". Kairo is the original Japenese version. Although most Japenese film remake are awful (The Ring 2) - Pulse is just as frightening and suspenseful as the original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually i have not got anything to say about this film. Really, i mean come on! It's just bloody great, maybe that's why i gave it a "one", you know people, just take a look at the director, the actors, take a look at this, and maybe, maybe you will already find it all great, but if it's not enough for you, let's go through the plot. So, some guy, got virus out of nowhere with dead people coming out of it. Then his soul gets stolen, and he kills himself, his girlfriend does not find it strange...then his friends start to act themselves weird, and die...then, god, that's too hard. The point is this movie is about nothing, people die, and then comes the end of the world. And that's it. So, have a nice evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was awful on so many levels it is hard to fathom. I have seen a few of the Japanese horror adaptations (The Grudge, The Ring, etc.) and thought I had found a refreshing new genre. That is until the inept writing ability of Wes Craven brought my lucky streak to a screeching halt! Congratulations Mr. Craven. It took you 17 years to write a screenplay as awful as "Shocker", but you have returned! Of course, what would a ridiculous story and terrible dialogue be without a heavy helping of acting performances so bad they would make a porno director squirm? Just to maintain continuity, the film isn't even visually interesting. For heaven's sake, take off the blue filter!! I went to the theater restroom immediately following the movie, and my eyes were so goofed up, I thought I was peeing green. Don't even worry about an occasional "Boo!" scene. If you have seen the trailer, you have seen everything there is to offer. If you absolutely insist on seeing "Pulse", at least do yourself a favor and don't buy the big bucket of popcorn. You're going to want to walk out before it's finished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who buys this storyline shouldn't be allowed to use wireless. Period. Get off your cell phone. Get off your laptop. Go read a book about how networks (wired/wireless) work.What happened to the good old days where a virus created zombies, and ghosts haunted houses? You know, back when things MADE SENSE.They made sense because they used unknown variables (virii, ghosts, etc.) that weren't actually real, defined, things in life.Wireless networks are not all connected to each other. Every wireless network is broadcast from some tier of a wired network. Why didn't these monsters spread to the wired networks? How did they get into all of the home networks that operate on different frequencies, independently of each other? How did they get past the WEP/WPA encryption found on most home networks nowadays?Nobody can answer these questions. Not even the screenwriter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most worthless movie I have ever seen,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So tonight I hung-out with some friends and these good friends of mine felt like it would be fun to see a movie. Looking at the huge digital board hanging high above my local multiplex we pondered what to see. Me being me I told them half of those movies I have already seen... Talladega Nights? "That just happened." (Yes it's that funny, go see it already.). The Descent? You know it. Miami Vice? You bet cha'. Pirates of the Caribbean 2? Who hasn't? Aye aye aye they didn't want to see a flick I've already had the honor of seeing --yes honor, after Pulse any movie is a honor to see.We started to check out the new films released this week. Zoom, Pulse, World Trade Center, and Step Up. What the hell is Step Up you may ask? Heh, just do a search for it. Taking the advice of a friend I asked them if they wouldn't mind seeing WTC. They all just stare at me, I shut up. We started to think about "Zoom" but then we remembered Tim Allen was in it... do I miss his Home Improvement days. So we decided on Pulse. Did I want to see this? Hell no, looked bad from the beginning. But I was with some friends and they wanted to go, so I was not going to be the one to ruin their fun.I'm gonna steal Mr. D's words here but watching a film about suicide I really wanted to end my own life while I sat there. This movie is excruciating to view, there is nothing scary, nor funny, nor entertaining whatsoever about this at all. Pulse is the most worthless movie I have ever laid eyes on. I used to think the same about a film called When a Stranger Calls but I could watch that a hundred times over compared to what I've just witnessed tonight. I am sitting here right now and I cannot think of anything at all that I can say was good about this flick.The directing was all point and shoot, the camera rarely ever moved around during a shot. Not what you want to do with a horror movie, especially one being designed for teenagers. The actors, who weren't terrible, had no script to work with. There is seriously one scene where everybody is standing around and they decide they need to head back to an apartment of friend who died because his computer is still sending them messages (which means the place is dangerous to be in). Right then a character blurts out: "I'll go by myself." I blurted out in laughter, I just couldn't help it, I mean come on, that's terrible. The whole look of this film is bad as well, we're all the audience suppose to get this feeling that the end of the world is upon us. But I just sat there wondering why the streets are completely empty, why Kristin Bell is such a cutie, and why the hell this movie makes me want to give up movie watching all-together.I sincerely believe this movie might just bring the horror industry the end of this PG-13 J-horror remake trend. It's that bad. Avoid this at all costs, even if your friends are with you. There is no worse pain then to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save your money!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into the theater not expecting much from this film, and that's basically what I got. Not much.The premise is very tired (paranormal evil invades our computers, brings death and destruction) the plot is convoluted, and the acting is sub-par. Kristen Bell gives a weepy, melodramatic performance, while Christina Milian and Ian Somerhalder are basically extended cameos. The characters are pitifully undeveloped, and the interaction between them is awkward and forced. Unfortunately, I imagine the actors did the best they could with what they were given.The film itself utterly fails to fit the description of a "horror" title. For a movie about malicious ghosts spreading throughout our telecommunications technology, it's hardly scary. Even scenes that are meant to make you jump in your seat fall flat, due to the complete lack of tension in the characters. The best that can be said of this film is that it has moments of mediocre creepiness.Honestly, save your money. If you absolutely have to see it, wait until it's available for rental and save a few bucks. As a friend said when we exited the theater, "On a scale of 'White Noise' to 'The Ring', I give it a 'Fear dot Com'."</fullReview>

No? Darn, all the useful lessons I learned from this great film don't seem to be panning out!Seriously though, this movie was very very bad. I was in hysterics through most of it. And at the end, I just couldn't help but wonder why they didn't just cut the power to the city? Last time I checked, signals being present infers that technology is present. They said all this trash about abandoning cell phones and PDA's and what not, and then you have some terrible punch out ending where the girl says "Oh, the cities? yeah, we can never go back, we lose. bye."

		<fullReview>You know it's bad movie when the cinema is only 40% capacity on a summer Saturday afternoon. The actors can't act. I don't know who's bright idea it was to cast Kristen Bell aka the Veronica Mars chick as the lead, because she is B.A.D. She was talentless on TV, and worse on the big screen. Christina Milian should stick to her singing career - if you can call it that - because that girl did not mutter more than 5 lines in the entire movie. And throwing in Boone from Lost (Ian Somerhalder) does not help - he's believable as a spoilt brat with an incestous crush on his sister - but as a grungy, techie who tries to save the world, not so much. I have one word for the acting = weak. The movie tries really really hard to be like "28 Days" replacing the zombie virus with a computer virus, and fails really really badly. Ugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghosts in the Wi-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the advertisements, the American remake of the Japanese horror film "Pulse" has very little to do with the original.I saw the Japanese original on DVD last month and I liked it. It gave me nightmares, but I didn't think it would go over well with American audiences because it was slow and creepy, but not very scary.Apparently American horror-meister, Wes Craven, felt the same way and he rewrote the script to include much more scary ghosts in the same vein as his "Nightmare on Elm Street" series or "Poltergeist." The result is less artistic than the original "Pulse," but it is more likely to appeal to what Americans expect from a horror film.Unlike "The Descent," which I saw last week, this film does not rely on the gimmick of quick cuts of monsters jumping out at the screen. "Pulse" is filmed with a lot of style and has plenty of scary ghosts."Pulse" would have been even better if it had more subtle editing, a more discreet soundtrack, better actors, and better dialog; but most horror fans will not care about that.If you like a good, old fashioned, scary, ghost film; you will probably like "Pulse."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compared to The Ring, I'd rather watch Pulse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I've heard that this movie was coming out, I've wanted to see it. I adore Kristen Bell on Veronica Mars, and Jonathan Tucker is my favorite actor. Plus, some eye candy with Ian Somerhalder, and a movie in my favorite genre; I had to see it.It kept getting pushed back, but finally, it was released, and I saw it opening weekend. To no surprise to me, most of my friends refused to see it, saying they'd be too scared, or that it just didn't look good. But finally, I got someone to go with. After what others who had seen it told me, I was a little wary, but still knew I had to see it.During the movie, my friend compared it to The Ring, which is, as we all now, another movie based on a Japanese horror. It could also be compared to The Grudge. But all three are different movies, and I'm not saying you'll like this if you liked those, but you might be more open to Pulse.When it comes to scares, this movie relies on loud noises to frighten it's watchers, but for me, it worked. I didn't expect to be scared at all, so I was pleasantly surprised when I jumped more than once. Sitting in the theatre, I was creeped out, unsure of what was behind me in the shadows.Also, I wasn't sure of the plot, an infection being spread through wireless networks sounded a little strange to me, but watching the movie, I was drawn in. The characters, the plot, everything was interesting to me.Pulse is my kind of movie; dark, a little twisted, and pretty much weird. It makes me think of Cry Wolf. And in my opinion, better than The Ring. I'll enjoy watching it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Josh Ockmann is attacked in the library. His girlfriend Mattie Webber (Kristen Bell) finds him in a disturbing state at his apartment and then he hangs himself. After getting mysterious computer messages, her friend Stone (Rick Gonzalez) goes to shut down Joss's computer but it's already taken. Stone is attacked just like Josh. The landlady sold Dexter McCarthy (Ian Somerhalder) the computer. Josh had sent Mattie 3 rolls of red duct tape 2 days before he died. The rolls are split up between Mattie and her friends Izzie Fuentes (Christina Milian) and Tim (Samm Levine). There is an epidemic of suicides in the area.The movie is saturated with the color blue. Along with the Eastern European location, this drains the life out of the movie. It tries quite a few jump scares. Mostly, they don't work because the story is lifeless. The other problem is that the spirits come out of nowhere randomly. It actually gets a bit boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully done but really confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of a friend, a group of college friends find themselves the targets of ghostly beings spread over the internet by logging onto a computer system and must try to survive the freed hordes.This was quite a bland and dull remake. Among the many flaws here is that what happens for the most part simply isn't scary as this one goes against so many different tactics that it never gives off any kind of creepy feeling. This starts with the ghosts themselves, as there's nothing here about what they are, where they came from or even the purpose behind their appearance here which really leaves just an endless series of questions about them. There's only one real piece of information given to this series of creatures about being able to exist on broadbands and wave-lengths emitted from most of modern technology, but that's all we get here as far as going out to mention what they are or tormenting the people here. It's so light on explanations that even that factor alone is given with nearly ten minutes or so left in the film, and it really makes the film really lame by being so unwilling to reveal the truth about its main threat which is needed to score fear against them. It doesn't matter much as the computer-static blue that represents the ghostly figures in the few scenes they're on-screen isn't all that terrifying anyway so the physical appearance doesn't matter much and the explanations are a non-factor which makes the ghosts overall a total sour point. Thais leads into the fact that there's hardly any attacks here which makes this one feel so drawn-out and overlong when it doesn't need to as well as keeping this one focused on areas that don't generate anything as this is mostly focused on an investigation into their friends' behavior and the origins of the beings that turn up nothing so there's simply nothing to these scenes as they just tend to focus on these useless scenes. The last flaw to hold this one down is the bland gray-coloring that flows throughout the film, making for a truly tough time here since that makes this one almost impossible to really get into as it causes this to be bland unappealing and really impossible to watch. That's' more than damaging enough to lower this one, though amidst all this there's a few enjoyable moments. These are deviated entirely around the few ghostly encounters here, from the opening in the library to the startling Laundromat attack and the apartment encounter where the disappear into ash though the big scene here is undoubtedly the final attack in the computer lab where the ghosts are finally freaky-looking in their numbers, the action works and overall the scene is impressive and freaky. Otherwise, there's not much at all to this one.Rated PG-13: Language and Mild Violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you check out other reviews for the U.S. remake of the Japanese horror film 'Pulse' you'll see that the majority of people hated it. And I can see why. The first time I watched it I wasn't interested to begin with. It came across as your regular slasher film, only with computer ghosts stalking and killing teenagers instead of a physical killer.Then there were the - obvious - similarities to the (far superior) Ring. However, I thought it actually picked up a bit of pace in the second half. Once the more 'apocalyptic' side of the story takes over then there are a few nice moments.If you have high expectations for this film, then you'll definitely hate it. However, if you're just looking for a (slightly) better than average horror flick then give it a go. Acting - average. Plot - average. Special effects - average. Yet, somehow, if you're in the right mood, you may give it that extra 'mark' to turn its rating from a 6 to a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this in a cinema while on holiday in Thailand and although I knew nothing about the movie, it looked interesting enough to give it a go and I was not disappointed.A computer hacker unwittingly hacks into the computer of a fellow student who was working on technology to discover alternate frequencies. Unfortunately what he hacked into was also a pathway for spirits and demons to gain access into our world of the living. It sounds like a stupid premise for a film plot, and it kinda is, but for a horror movie it sets a rather interesting chain of events in motion that for me at least, seemed to work.Josh, the computer hacker, is attacked by a spirit and becomes withdrawn. His girlfriend, Mattie, worried about his state of mind, goes to see him. She finds his apartment is unkempt and Josh in a zombie-like state. He walks off and when she goes to look for him she finds that Josh has suddenly hanged himself in the other room. Mattie and her friends start to receive messages from Josh's computer repeatedly asking them for help. This starts her investigation into what he was up to and what has led him to commit such an act.Throughout the movie people start to randomly become withdrawn and display tendencies of no longer caring about themselves or anything around them, including her other friends, until they either suicide or their bodies wither and die leaving nothing but ash. As more and more people end up disappearing the only remedy seems to be to lock yourself away and seal the room with red electrical tape. This has something to do with the colour spectrum and not allowing the spirits to penetrate through that colour.The spirits that find their way through via internet connections, WiFi and any kind of digital signals, prey on the living and literally suck their will to live. Being the spirits of the dead, they seem to draw on the life force of people. The whole things appears to start by way of a viral program that appears on computer screen entitled "do you want to see a ghost". What appears next is a series of images of people that are in a dark and withdrawn state either staring blankly back at the viewer or they are engaged in some form of suicide; and as the movie progresses, you realise that these images are people that have recently succumbed to having their life force drained.Mattie discovers what is going on and with the help of Dex, who had purchased Josh's computer, discover that there was a program developed by Josh that may put an end to the whole thing. Mattie and Dex find the university computer server where it all apparently started and upload the counter virus and the whole system crashes. However after it reboots, the spirits re-emerge and it starts all over again. Their only solution is to get away from the cities and therefore, away from anything that can receive a signal such as mobile phone etc. Essentially this means the world is back in the stone age.Overall I enjoyed this film yet it's not one of those horrors that people will want to see over and over and it did suffer from some inconsistencies which do let it down as they could have been handled better. It's dark, depressing and moody and despite people losing friends and family and multiple suicides happening regularly, people seem to be caught up with their own personal struggle rather than overly worrying or mourning about others. Some people have commented that this doesn't make any sense and the whole movie is stark and lifeless, yet for me it's deliberately allegorical for today's society. How many people do you see these days, with their heads buried in iPhones and iPads, caring more what's happening in the digital world than what's just outside? It's not always noticed when a friend doesn't surface for a few days, so the dark mood and sombre tones are in keeping with the story. Pulse is also the Americanised version of the Japanese film Kairo, which I have since also seen and unlike other awful Americanised movies such as The Eye, I enjoyed Pulse much more than it's Japanese counterpart.There have unfortunately been 2 or 3 sequels to Pulse which were direct to DVD which try to expand on the story, but this was totally unnecessary as Pulse can quite easily be a stand alone film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pulse is a movie with a point. Almost a fable. The moral of Pulse is not to mess around with things you don't understand.Pulse has fairly decent pacing, and is more creepy/psychological than shock-horror, which I appreciate in today's torture-porn infused horror scene.While some parts of the movie are slightly unrealistic, in an Amazing Spiderman "no computer nerd uses Bing!" kinda way, for the most part the movie actually has the actors respond in a realistic way to what is happening. When a friend dies they are clearly emotionally disturbed, in a much more believable manner than throwing their hands in the air and screaming. When a static-infused computer-thing comes out of the computer screen, they don't sit there and try to talk to it or touch it, they get the heck out of there! All in all, I actually enjoyed this movie. The premise is good, the music rather unremarkable, the explanation of things is vague enough that I feel they didn't give it all away and ruin the terror, but I can see why people might have an issue with the ending, although I felt it was okay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Josh (Jonathan Tucker), a computer hacker, breaks into a novelty IT facility, which by pure chance has created a computer virus that invokes the dead. By hacking into the joint Josh unwittingly releases the virus into the world and is soon to become one of the first victims, when an undead phantom steals his lifeforce. His university girlfriend Mattie (Kristen Bell) worried about the lack of contact from Josh decides to visit him at home. There however she only finds a lifeless shell of her boyfriend, who after a short chit chat decides to end his decrepit existence. Preferred suicide: hanging. This however is just the beginning, as the end is the end of the world as we know it...Probably said a bit too much in the intro, but truthfully it won't really matter, as the plot is essentially quite absurd. It either catches on to you or it doesn't. In my case I admire the intention, but must wallop the execution. The script doesn't hold up well to the Japanese original and basically takes on the form of the teenage horror flick with an end of the world twist. Also a lot of the scenes seem forced, especially those with computers turning themselves on or running without power.The biggest no-no is the big finale, where our hero (a random guy called Dexter, who comes to Mattie's aide) has a chance to destroy the contagion by installing a special code made by Josh that would destroy the original programming. This initially works, but soon the system starts rebooting. A logical conclusion would be to try to pull the plug before that happens. But Dexter decides to run...Additionally there is almost total lack of character building with stereotypes being given free reign in the pic. Basically we are rushing through the story until we reach a rather subpar conclusion. But well...Not all is bad. There are scenes that work and the special effects are really adequate to the scare in hand. Here and there you find very nice ideas behind the movie, but just not enough of them to push the film into the 'good zone'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries to be more like an horror movie than the original, which goes at the expense of the story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, the Japanese movie "Kairo" was an huge surprise. I was expecting a "Ringu" like Japanese horror movie but instead got a thought provoking, well scripted movie, that was not even really an horror at all. It was an highly original movie with some great themes in it. Like all successful or remotely interesting foreign movies, Hollywood also decided to remake this movie for the more mainstream audiences. It means that they changed quite a lot for this movie, which unfortunately is not for the good of it.I can definitely see how this movie can come across as incredibly confusing and as hard to understand nonsense, if you haven't seen the original movie. The original movie already was an incredibly hard one to follow at times but at least it all in the end made sense. This movie does however too hard its best to make sense, by simplifying lots of stuff in the movie. So what you have now in its core is a difficult main plot, with some simplistic explanations hanging around it. It doesn't make the movie easier but instead more ridicules. It's hard to buy anything in this movie, if you don't understand what the story in its essence is all supposed to be originally about.It was quite surprising to see how much of the story they had changed for this movie. The original movie in essence was all about loneliness, while this movie is simply about ghosts, causing some kind of apocalypse, when they get unleashed through the Internet. No, most of the changes are not for the good of this movie. Suddenly the ghost are murderous evil characters, trying to scare and kill people and even the reason for the red tape in this movie has changed into something quite ridicules and it doesn't even get explained well enough. The title "Pulse" even doesn't make sense anymore.This movie was obviously aiming toward an horror audience, with its creepy atmosphere, scare moments and lots of special effects. The average horror lover however will care very little about this story and are more interest in some good gore and scares, which this movie does simply not have. So it's kind of hard to tell what is the right audience for this movie, which should also be the reason why the movie didn't do too well and it's being rated quite poorly. This movie will get probably watched by mostly horror lovers, who will simply not love this movie.But in all honesty, it just isn't an horrible movie. But again, this might also probably be due to the fact that I already knew what the story was all about and heading toward because I had already seen the original Japanese production. I'm sure if I hadn't watched that one, I would had hated this movie far more, strangely enough because it would had been a far more confusing movie. Now I could understand the story, even when it didn't got told too well. Some of the good ideas of the original are still present in this movie, though they do not get handled too well. It's a simplistic movie, with an hard main story, that doesn't really know how to reach the right kind of audience. I can definitely say you are better of watching the original and then come back and revisit this movie. Changes are you'll probably like it better then.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Perfect, But Way Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS! DO NOT READ AHEAD UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN IT OR JUST DON'T CARE*Wow. Pulse. This movie is one bizarre trip. Ever since The Ring became a huge success, it has opened the floodgates, inviting American companies to remake Japanese horror films. Most aren't that great. But something in Pulse was a little different. It wasn't incredible or anything, but the surreality of it was mesmerizing. The movie felt like is took place in someone's twisted dream. There is no gore, there are few boo-scares, and the movie relies on sheer creepiness and dark, subliminal imagery to mess with us. The cinematography is pale and cold, and puts a sense of eerie menace even over the happier parts of the movie. The black spots on the people are really disturbing and add very much to the dreaminess, and it raises the question: don't we all just become black spots after death? I haven't seen the original, which I hear is more ponderous than horrific, but I think that movies should be judged individually, not against its predecessor. After all, the predecessors are almost always better. The bathroom scene was truly symbolically original. Normally the ghost would lock the door to the room and crawl out after her, but instead, they insinuated that ghosts are always around us, and aren't always the monstrous and evil beings Hollywood makes them out to be. Sometimes they just want to make themselves known. The lesson they are trying to teach is that technology is very new. We will learn more and more things through what we find, and we won't always like what we learn. And the entire thought of a ghost apocalypse is just plain freakin trippy. I don't really get the plane crashing. After all, those idiots who run the planes won't let you use your cell. My only complaint are the flat actors. But I guess they could've had a signal, maybe. Anyway, Pulse deserved a 6.5 out of 10, for its bizarre take on the modern Japanese import film and dreamy state.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary ghost story showing strange and mesmerizing images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake from Japanese film begins when a hacker penetrates the computer of Josh(Jonathan Tucker) and spontaneously releases a weird virus, starting to happen rare things to the University residents. His ex-girlfriend, a psychology student named Matte(Kristen Bell) along with her friends(Christina Milian, Rick Gonzalez,Samm Levine) investigate a series of suicides linked to an Internet web cam which causes visitors an interacting with astonishing dead. Some of them watch crawling shadows on the wall and vision of dead people . Later Matte befriends a new boy(Ian Somerhalder), both facing spectres from beyond the grave when sinister deeds are going on.This creepy movie contains ghostly images,chills, thrills and a completely eerie mood throughout.This supernatural horror film talks about people may become solitary, the loneliness in modern society, in spite of connecting wireless technology, cellphones and internet .Ghastly and astonishing frames about apocalyptic happenings with dark skies, deserted streets,creepy mood, similarly to classic films, such as 'Lifeforce and Quatermass and the pit'. Casting is quite good, along with young actors,Bell, Milian,Tucker,Somerhalder, appear distinguished veterans,as Brad Dourif, Zach Grenier and Ron Rifkin. Well written by Wes Craven and Kiyoshi Kurosawa, original author of Kairo(2001) and professionally directed by Jim Sonzero. Dark photography with muted colors generating a horror sensation by Mark Plummer. Haunting and incredibly eerie musical score by Elia Cmiral. Followed by an inferior sequel titled : ¨Pulse, after life¨(by Joel Soisson with Jamie Bamber, Giorgina Rylance).Rating : Acceptable and passable, this psychological horror tale will leave you stunned and squirm for intensely eerie events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good attempt at translating a complex movie for North America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the original, I had some idea of what to expect. However, this movie tried to explain the plot to death and it was just too much to handle. The beauty of the original is just how much is left unexplored in detail. All the little things that don't quite fit; that has the power to unnerve us. This was too sanitized and too supercharged to get the job done. The pacing was far to fast and it lacked the intrigue of the Asian version.However, it does manage to stand alone as a fairly well executed ghost story in its own right. The effects were excellent and there were some genuinely scary moments. Perhaps North American audiences are more attuned to zombie enemies, something corporal... ghosts may be less immediate and visceral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Very Much Horror.. Be Glad I Didn't Walk Out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really consider this movie horror. It reminds me of an action-themed movie with guns and rivers. I don't know why. This movie had too many faults to begin with. Ghosts, viruses, a laptop, suicide.. just doesn't fit together perfectly as I wanted it to.Although, it did have some faults, I did enjoy it. I don't know why it has a 4/10 estimated rating at the moment, but just give this movie a chance. Think of the positives. I enjoyed it because I'm interested in computers, also this movie was just exciting and had some suspense.I loved the characters and that one evil old man in the gas station people thought was crazy. Or it was a restaurant. But it was some typical old thing you see all the time, I still liked it. "Do not go! Leave town". I also love the webcams of the dead. It was just so creepy! I recommend this movie for if you like something that's slightly creepy but exciting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am extremely easy on how I vote on horror movies, I'm lenient some might say compared to other genres. First off I had no idea this was a remake of a Japanese movie before I saw it, yet within 5 minutes I knew it was, no need to tell me in advance I could tell from the style of the film, my first thought was "is this a jap remake" and it turned out to be so, no surprise there.For what it's worth, I thought this film was half decent. The acting didn't make me cringe and the story was not so bad compared to other horror films. Of course it's full of the usual clichéd aspects but as horror fans you should be used to that. The film is really blue in tone, in fact i'm sure the makers just said screw it lets film with a blue tint without but I feel it works well and suits the tone and pace of the film. In the end it had some decent ideas and was a decent film but still ends up falling short. It's worth a watch but I can't see anybody wanting to go back for repeat viewings.Overall a decent flick with not much repeat value, acting wasn't terrible and the story was half decent but it wont live long in the mind as being anything special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another Hollywood movie with hints of creativity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another typical Hollywood movie with sub par acting. This movie was a bit far fetched even for fiction and this is easily concluded with analyzation of its plot, which subsequently contained a few holes. Overall the movie itself is watchable with some creative moments, above average visuals and decent special effects. With it PG13 rating its one of those horror movies that uses volume for effect rather than violence and gore, with the exception of 1 or 2 scenes. Lots of sudden spontaneous moments are this movies main efforts. I thought the ending was stupid and added to the "hollywood-esque" feeling of the movie. I wouldn't really recommend this movie to anyone wanting a great horror flick but rather as a bored Sunday type of movie. Almost a winner but falls way short of anything ingenious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Horror concept-- but they flubbed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghosts, or ethereal dead are always there-- but unseen until humans unwittingly open up the extra bandwidth and let them in.There was a Twilight-zone/Outer Limits quality to the concept. The problem was that I did not care about the characters. No build-up, no history, no emotional hook. Nothing. First college kid gets killed/sucked dry? and then we're listening to another bunch of zero-personality college brats try and give us a sense of angst over the strange goings on. Just because a pretty actress-girl-clone loses her boyfriend, I'm supposed to be on the edge of my seat? And the Bluish tint of the movie didn't do anything mood-wise for me. It made it feel more washed out.By the time we're seeing the scenes of post apocalypse empty streets and burning wrecks, my reaction was: 'Eh, so what, who cares?' The rest of the cast was a bunch of bluish nobodies anyway.The sad thing, when a story is done badly-- it's hard as hell to do it Right thereafter. This could have given me goosebumps just from looking at my cell-phone or static on my monitor in a shadowy room.Lost opportunity, folks. Creative ruin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You could of gotten a better vote than a 4 from me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well the reason why I gave this movie Pulse a 4 is because you took out Jonathan Tucker right away. And you made him look like a drunk, like the bad one. Then, you put in Ian Somerhalder in as Dexter. So I think that you should of switched Josh ( Jonathan Tucker ) and Dexter ( Ian Somerhalder ) characters. Because when I saw Hostage and The Texas Chainsaw movie with Jonathan Tucker, he was a great actor, and when you put him as a crazy guy, that put your grade down. Like Pulse could of gotten a 10 from me and probably a lot more people if you switched those two characters! But other than the bad parts in the film,, I really enjoyed the movie and I hope you make a part two. But as my suggestion, I think that you should put Jonathan Tucker in it ( if you even make a part two ) but pretend he's a ghost. Because with that guy and like probably more guys, the film/movie would get better votes if you do it. Thanks_____Stefanie.</fullReview>

Now, regarding the above comment on loose ends: I agree 100% here, the writing of the movie was pretty weak, and it leaves you pretty frustrated at the end. Loose end after loose end stopped this movie from being better, which it potentially could have been with a little more effort.All in all, I would at the very most rent this one, or better yet download it...it's out of theatres so no one else can waste money there, but you're better off leaving this one for a rainy, bored day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad film on the whole I must say. The special effects are very good, especially the way the dead take your 'will to live' as they say. The scenes in the 'other world' are good too, particularly that face made of hands. However, there are some flaws I'd like to mention. First of all, I find the story somewhat poor - bringing ghosts into our world through computers and mobile phones is ridiculous in my opinion. And blocking the transmission with Red Tape is even worse. Also, the ghosts could have been made more scary. And how come in the laundry various pairs of hand and feet where coming out of the washing machine when there was only one ghost! By the way, who killed the cat in the beginning?

I was very disappointed with the story line and the grungy darkness that was in every scene until the very end when the sun is finally shining. The ghost in question whom stalks everyone was not scary by any means I believe a good horror movie needs to be believable in some sense and the pulse delivers none of that. It did not appeal to me with the story or characters. Not worth my watching again and definitely not worth the money to rent it. If your interested in watching a movie dealing with the same aspect of ghosts haunting someone, there is an older movie called "White Noise" one of the best I have ever seen dealing with the paranormal.</fullReview>

I should have waited for it to come on Dish instead of ordering the pay-per-view. They could have left the cat scene out of it (personal preference).

What is unfortunate is that it is neither challenging nor scary. If it was scary one could excuse the silliness however the movie never quite gets to the point of being scary.That said, I have seen far worse movies. This certainly wasn't the worst one I've seen.

		<fullReview>Spoiler**** Here's the red-tape to cover up some of the holes OK, So after watching Pulse, i think I may have answers that could "fix" some of the holes in this movie.First off the creatures...whatever they are, ghosts, monsters, lost souls, whatever...they're signal based, the stronger the signals the stronger their power (that would suck for ppl at any hot-spot) without a signal they cannot exist. This is stated in the movie.The red-tape, again another thing explained in the movie. Usually things block signals, for some reason i guess this is magic, holy, admin blessed tape.Answer to "Why not just unplug the power?" It was based in a server room, if it was as easy as unpluging the power to the system they probably would have done that. They would have had to disconnect and remove all of the servers, switches, hubs, routers, wireless connections. This would have been solved with a molotov cocktail (unless there was a halon based system in the room, which I am assuming that there was).Why didn't the virus work? Again assuming that there were backup measures to keep the server from crashing, there was probably some restore feature on the server."Why didn't they just come through the Radio?" It would have had to be connected to the network. Everything that was effected was connected through the creatures' portal, the system in the server room. The computer was connected to the internet, which is connected to pretty much everything now, cellphones, lan-line phones, etc. The Radio that the army was broadcasting through was an outgoing signal.Solution: Get some soldiers, wrap them in red tape, break into the server room, and destroy the "wide-band" device. It could make a foundation for a horrible action-suspense movie.</fullReview>

The reason this movie is not getting a 1/10 from me is because the idea is somewhat interesting and the acting wasn't half bad. Pulse, however, did not deliver for me. I am a guy all about great endings. If a movie doesn't have a good ending then it leaves viewers disappointed, and I was very disappointed with the ending to Pulse.

I just liked the dark look of this movies, just like you see in "Underworld" or "Gattaca".

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie was a bit of a knock off of the ring, grudge and any other Japanese remake made in the past four or five years, still though I enjoyed it a bit. I thought it moved rather fast, and it was not boring for me so there you go. If I was a film critic I would lament the movie and curse its ever being made, but as just a dude who likes horror movies I liked it okay enough. This movie is a remake of a Japanese movie called "Kairo", and I found this movie to be better than that one. It had better images and scary stuff. That movie was a bit overlong and did not really explain anything at all. However, this movie did explain to much...let me just say if you combine the two movies you would probably have a really good scary movie. This one is typical, everything is told to us and to be frank I hated the whole stealing the will to live thing. This was not in the original, but then this one only has some scenes that resemble each other and some of the plot is similar as well, but for the most part they are different. The movie has an eerie force coming through computers and other devices of a communication nature and coming after people. That is the extent of the film, nothing groundbreaking and certainly nothing original as the back of the box claims. I think it was wireless magazine that said it was the most original horror movie of the year, I am guessing this is the only one he has seen. This movie is more about ghosts coming to get you, while the Japanese version was more of a tale of loneliness and isolation that only gets touched on once here. So should you watch it...I don't know, if you are like me and give horror movies a break and enjoy them for what they are, an hour and a half cheesy diversion, then see it. If you tend not to like movies of this nature, basically "The Ring" and stuff skip it, you will not like it.</fullReview>

Really, I think this movie on some levels competes with Spielberg latest sci-fi movies. I think I wouldn't have made that comment if I had seen this movie in the theaters.The special features played a big part in my vote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst horror movie ending of 2006!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kristen Bell is very good actress. She done well in "Veronica mars". But in "Pulse", she done a huge mistake. This movie has the disaster at the ending. The whole movies good, but ending... I don't know what to say. Americans almost all Japanese horror movies remakes and almost all remakes are awful. Hollywood had to make good movies their own, not to remake Asian cinema...Acting was normal, except Christina Milian. She hed her place in music and she had to stay there, because she acts very bad... Inexperienced producer had no skills making this movie.I give a 4 for the ordinary bad remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen the film and people keep seeming to be under the premise that it is a the film is about a computer virus going around.It is in fact not a virus, at the end you find out that some telecom folk were doing some work with different wave patterns and found "patterns that we didn't even know existed" that is where the ghosties are living (sorry dead).The ghosts use this as a conduit to enter our world.I'm not quite sure why the dead want to suck out our souls, but there you go.... make a good film.I actually enjoyed the film. The beginning was a bit slow, character development was pretty non existent. Lots of predictable camera flashes - eerie sounds, that got a bit annoying, but by the middle of the film the suspense was all there.The way things were going - I am surprised that anyone managed to survive, especially the main leads - when they go into the server room at the end and there are about 50 ghosts ready to get them they luckily manage to escape....Well anyway - i rate this a 6</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in a sneak preview in Germany. I dislike Wes Craven, but when the movie began i hoped for a surprise. Although the first half is some kind of interesting, it gets worse when the real story comes out. The actors are not that bad, but the threat itself did not really affect me. The voice at the end, warning mankind not to ignore the risk of radio waves and wireless devices, reminded me very much of Outer Limits... Maybe this is a new kind of Internet/Wlan Horror, but it feels like an online version of The Ring. Dawn of the Dead for example is lot lot better, and it does not take itself too serious. I would not recommend "pulse", and i wonder if Wes craven would...</fullReview>

The movie have some good boo scares and have a creepy atmosphere and there are some parts that are pretty scary for example when a monster come out of the washing machine in the laundry room and take over the girl and see all the zombies or dead people in the computer screen and the movie have a pretty good start off and a good ending(not really a happy ending)but the only thing I don't like about this movie is the plot is easy to understand but is not really good they could make the story far more interesting and better. Over all this is a pretty decent movie definitely not the best I watched or the worst movie I watched the only thing this movie can improve on is the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I think the question is how long have they been watching me." - Dexter McCarthey Not a good film in any regards, but in an era where most horror films that are released suck and make no sense, Pulse has one-up on them. Instead of being laced with over-the-top ridiculous and laughable dialogue and ceasing to be scary, 'Pulse' offers a decent screenplay (not great, but decent) and a couple of spooky shots. Some of it doesn't make sense, but a great majority of it does, which is more than I can say for 'The Grudge', 'The Ring 2', or dozens more of these recent mindless wastes of film horror movies. Kristen Bell is decent in her role but the rest of the cast is worthy of Razzies. Ian Somerhalder 'Lost' proves once again just because you look good, doesn't mean you act well. However, when all is said and done and those ending credits are rolling, 'Pulse' really doesn't seem like that big of a waste of time. If you like horror movies, I recommend this.

Not only is the film boringly confusing, but it's also incredibly predictable. The only decent thing about it is that Christina Milian looks beautiful in it. The acting talent of Jonathan Tucker is completely put to waste, and if Kristin Bell wants to have adecent acting career, she should choose to be in films that have muchmore depth and plot than this.

It is so frightening and makes you forget breathing. I heard people saying after seeing the film "I will never switch on my computer again!" It has the specific atmosphere of Japanese films that is often - unfortunately mostly - lost when they are adapted by Western filmmakers. I can imagine that they tried to change the partly unexplained and not rational aspects of the original film but for me that is one reason why that film is so special. And that feeling of being lonely and lost in the world (although you can reach almost everybody in the world by internet) really catches you. So if you want to see a good PULSE watch the original!</fullReview>

Just as all children don't all understand a given subject in the same format, neither do adults. Different perspectives will appeal to different sectors of the viewing public. All versions are worthwhile as they all have something to offer. Different frequencies and dimensions is one of the most important subjects in this day and age, and Pulse is just showing a different point of view. The original, brilliant in its point of view, needs not to compete with other films addressing the the same subject matter. Watch all of them, they are all worth the investment of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find the critic's loathing of Pulse to be a bit of an overstatement. Okay so the film is not very suspenseful, the acting is weak and the ending is silly. Aside from that, I found Pulse fairly intriguing. I can't say I've seen a plot similar to this, but maybe I haven't seen enough ghost stories. It is weird, twisted and kind of freaky. The last act of the film is especially bleak and spooky, with a strange little cameo from Brad Dourif, who some might recognize from Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers, and TV goers will know him as the doctor from Deadwood. I mentioned that the film seems creative and unique, but if I thought about it for a while, I'm sure I'd be able to come up with a number of films which this either borrows from or directly resembles. Although labeled as a bad movie, Pulse can still be enjoyed by horror fans. Just do not expect to be scared out of your pants. If you approach the film that way, than yes, you may be disappointed. I didn't know what to expect when I approached Pulse, but what I saw didn't disappoint me.</fullReview>

Sometimes the pace is a bit slow but the very, very, good artwork and the great scares make it worth your while. The atmosphere is great. The artwork might be to much for some people, it might not be what you expect. I think this is the kind of movie where in about ten years everybody says it's a classic.If you like movies like The Ring or Silent Hill, I think you will like this one, it has many elements of both movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone wants to meet a ghost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oops I clicked on the link. I was never a fan of the original Japanese film, and this updated American take on the story isn't any better or make me feel any different about it. It's forgettable (like how the victims fade away to ashes) when it comes to shove, but for the moment it agreeably past the time with little worries. Again its plain dreary with a terrifically patient concept (about technology development and obsession being society's eventful downfall when a virus is let loose) that's a little more to it than your normal ghost seeking revenge yarn. Ray Wright and Wes Craven offer up a reliable screenplay. I hand it to the remake that it does feel far less drawn out (brisk pacing) and more complete, but this does lessen the hopelessly apocalyptic downbeat sense that breaks out and goes on to smother the air. Although the ending here is ultimately non-effective. The thing I couldn't figure out though, doesn't anyone know how to turn lights on. Oh there are so many passages? where obviously a light-switch was about. Was it to create atmosphere or to simply save energy? Director Jim Sonzero ably paints some stylish and shady cuts, but the scares are predictable (the usual jump tactics) and suspense minimal. Playing tricks with shadows and sounds feature largely. Elia Cmiral's suffocating score chimes in some eerie numbers. The performances are all solid and very well projected with Kristen Bell and Ian Sommerhalder leading the way. Look out for a short cameo role from an amusingly raving Bard Dourif.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J-horror fans may be upset at the way that Wes Craven took a great psychological horror film and turned it into something completely different, but it is really a good film on a different level.Horror isn't always about blood. In fact, it was never about blood in the early days. it's about fear, and this film does a good job of scaring the bejesus out of you.The existentialism of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Kairo is replaced with a Luddite view that technology is the source of our problems and we are all going to die because we are connected only though computers and phones.CGI was fantastic and Craven gave a good story with a lot of the same scenes as appeared in Kairo.The best feature of the film is Christina Milian, who had some serious booty and really kept me focused throughout. Too bad this is the first movie I have seen her in, and probably the last.I did see Kristen Bell in Deepwater, but didn't remember her. She really did a good job of acting, even if some of her scenes were unrealistic.Horror fans should find enough here to keep their interest unless they are just looking for blood.</fullReview>

The effects are good and the sets are appropriately depressing...The students DO seem to live in old style Communist Russia Housing Blocks, but the grayness and dinginess are probably supposed to help us feel that even the city itself is losing its will to live...think perhaps the writers and set decorators went to lots of classes on Symbolism in American Cinema?

		<shortDescription>Garden variety or just plain assembly line horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody can do a horror film, but it takes a certain art to do a horror film well. Given, as a must in horror you need to add extremely hot women, this movie succeeds at that but falls flat on it's face in a horror aspect. The idea of supernatural communication has existed since the dawn of time, and yet it seems fairly new to the horror genre, with a few exceptions. Pulse tries to add a horror element through establishing to some degree of believability, that the dead can communicate with us through the internet and all forms of modern technology, including cell phones and pda's, haunt us, and ultimately steal our will to live, turning us into ash, and eventually digital shadows of our former selves. This film is good for a laugh. The scariest moment in this film comes when the opening credits roll and one of the film's main protagonists is searching for a hard drive to upload a virus to destroy the communication line that he has established with the "other side;" keep in mind this is the scariest moment in the film, but it is not scary at all. By the time the ending credits roll you will want the last hour and a half of your life back. A suggestion to the wise; rent "the entity" or "poltergeist" before sitting through this abomination. If you want a disturbing internet horror, either rent "Hard Candy," or give all your personal information to a total stranger that you meet online. Otherwise, do not watch this film unless you need a lot of sleep. See you at the ticket window.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all the hate?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie last night and thought that it was an interesting and engaging piece of film making - but according to many of the comments on here it seems some people disagree.Certainly, the set-up isn't perfect and it does come across at first like another in the stable of The Ring (or, heaven forbid, feardotcom...) with the good looking lead and their not quite so good looking friend, to whom weird stuff starts happening. And yes, you will need to suspend a little bit of disbelief, but to anyone who starts railing about the red tape aspect warranting a '1' vote: not only is it ignoring the ideas actually put forward in the film that the wireless/phone coverage area allows the creatures to move but they themselves are blocked by the red (imagine it being the difference between oxygen and a brick wall) - why are they watching a supernatural thriller instead of a documentary? The acting is fine, no Oscar winners but nothing to drag the film down. The thing that really piqued my attention about this film is that although it begins like one of the same old same old Ring-lite films, the rising theme of a nationwide virus epidemic that swiftly spreads into crashing planes and deserted offices brings to mind films such as Day of the Dead of 28 Days Later, the ending somewhat more suited to apocalyptic zombie films than modern day 'self contained' supernatural thrillers. I enjoyed it for what it was, and would recommend it to be watched again. Of course, this was the UK cut complete with splatty tower suicide, so the emasculated PG-13 version in the US may be somewhat weaker. Seek out the hard stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Typical Supernatural Slasher Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that Pulse is not a horrible film. I've seen much worse. Of course, it's not nearly as good as the original Japanese film that it's based on ? Kairo.Like most horror films of recent release, Pulse suffers from it's inability to stray from formula conventions of the genre. For example, there is a false jump scare within the first 5 minutes of the film. The next one comes a minute later and is so damned predictable that I literally mocked my television screen the very second the ghost flew out of the bookshelf. Then, there's another pointless jump scare less than a minute after that. Then ? well ? I'm sure you get my point. The bottom line is that you've seen these same tactics used a hundred times before.The main problem that I have with this film is that it attempts to implement the philosophical concepts of Kairo, but fumbles them horribly. Some defenders of the film actually claim that it is BETTER than the original at expressing these concepts to the viewer. Needless to say, I have a real problem with this. So much so that I am going to provide specific wording in this review in CAPS in order to better emphasize the important points.The remake severely mishandles ? and even downright destroys ? the entire theme of loneliness that the original established so well. In the original, the characters encounter ghosts who COMMUNICATE their eternal loneliness to the living. After being faced with the reality of eternal loneliness, the characters lose their desire to live, and thus take their own lives conventionally (physical damage) or supernaturally (dissolving into ash).The creators of Pulse lose control of the concept of loneliness when Milan says: "(Ghosts) want what they don't have anymore. They want life. They're coming for you too." This is echoed again at the very end of the film: "The will to live never dies. Not for us, and not for (ghosts)." Goodbye loneliness! If people are killing themselves because they're lonely, why the hell would they want to live again!? It makes no logical sense, and it contradicts the entire premise of the film. At this point, Pulse regresses into a typical supernatural slasher flick devoid of any intelligence. This is characteristic of Hollywood horror movies, which almost always circumvent subtlety and intelligence, primarily because the filmmakers lack any sense of patience to allow concepts and themes to fully develop.Unfortunately, it's gets much, much worse as Pulse progresses. The Ziegler dude says: "Last thing you ever want is for them to get to you. Cause when they grab a hold of you, they take your will to live. Everything that made you you is gone." I'm perplexed that anyone would seriously claim that this film is about loneliness. It's almost as if the filmmakers wanted to beat a dead horse by providing obvious statements that Pulse IS NOT ABOUT LONELINESS. It's about ghosts who IMPOSE DEATH upon the characters because they want to live again. The original had none of this supernatural slasher stuff. In fact, none of the ghosts even touched the living. As mentioned earlier, they COMMUNICATED the fact that existence is eternal loneliness. Confronted with this INFORMATION, the characters lose their will to live in this world AND THE NEXT. It is this concept that makes Kairo an amazing piece of cinema, because it uses philosophical terror that applies to both the living and the dead. Pulse is just a slasher flick. This is explained to the viewer like a nail in the head near the end: "What was meant to connect us to one another, instead connected us to forces that we could have never imagined." Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. This has nothing to do with loneliness and everything to do with killer ghosts. This fundamental misunderstanding of communication is also expressed in the filmmakers' use of red tape. In the original, the red tape was used by characters to COMMUNICATE with other characters in an effort to warn them not to enter the forbidden rooms. In the remake, the tape is used to literally PROTECT the characters from the ghosts. Yet again, we see the unsophisticated, thoughtless foundation of Hollywood horror rearing its ugly head.The underlying theme of Kairo can be expressed as follows: The superficial "connections" that we sustain with each other are brittle, meaningless trivialities that shatter when confronted with the relentless isolation that exists on a much deeper level.Obviously, Kairo is mature, intelligent, and provides an interesting exposition on the concept of loneliness. Pulse will only satisfy those who ask less from their horror films.</fullReview>

But my friend just so desperately wanted to see it, so we rented it and watched it last night, while I wouldn't say that this was a great film, it was good, just an average horror film that had good potential, it just needed work. Some things were left unexplained and the ending just well... ended. But the film in the first hour was pretty good, I think they just didn't think it through, you know? Not to mention the acting got pretty crappy towards the ending.Mattie is worried about her ex boyfriend, Josh, since he left a weird message on her answering machine, so she decides to check on him herself at his apartment. There is a scary looking cat in the closet, the place is a mess, and Josh looks like he's not having a nice day, he hangs himself while she's there. All of a sudden there is a "suicide" epidemic we find out later is being caused by the ghosts who are spreading through technology.It actually sounds silly, but it worked for a little while, the makers of this film just got a little cocky or something. It's better than most of the Asian horror film remakes I've seen, but that's still not saying too much. But I always tell my mom to give a movie a shot, because you never know, you might like this film, I don't think it deserves a 4.0 rating, believe me when I say, that I've seen worse.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my amusing summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See the basic idea of this movie was ghosts traveling through the "WiFi". In the real world WiFi means wireless fidelity and was developed specifically for mobile computing devices and is not used by radio stations or cell phones that aren't VOIP. That doesn't really matter though for the purposes of the movie because the writers use it to mean any kind of invisible vibes floating around they don't understand including FM and AM radio. You see the ghosts "got in" because "we discovered a new frequency we didn't even know was there". Clearly that frequency should have been 99.1 megahertz so Spanish ghosts could start climbing out of the signal of radio WLZL "El Zol." Frequency in their context should have meant the number of crests of the wave per second (hertz). Apparently there was just some number civilization never discovered, or maybe the new frequency they discovered was... negative seven! In science fiction everything you say is automatically possible!So anyways these ghosts start messing with people's digital vibes and finally decide to start stealing souls. Stealing souls apparently drains your will to live for unexplainable reasons and makes black stuff grow on you, so then people kill themselves or turn into black stuff. To be fair the black stuff looked kind of itchy. There are two ways to stop this menace. You can cover all openings in your room with red utility tape. "It blocks part of their frequency" (apparently the same part of a radio frequency that needs you to open your window to let it in). Anyways, that's about equivalent to saying that red utility tape will make me easier to fight because it blocks part of my weight. Frequency is a simple measurement, like speed. Oh, but the other way to escape is to run for your life until your so far away that cell phones and radios don't receive a strong enough signal to work. After the standard horror movie requisite of 80% of the prominently starred teenagers and a skeptical adult die off the movie ends without resolution, but not before a grumpy ghost throws wet socks out of the laundromat dryer it resides in.Yeah.The end.The movie would have been terrible but in all fairness some of the imagery was very creepy. Watch it if you're a fan of the cheesy horror flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you want to meet a ghost??Pulse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does Hollywood insist on remaking movies from foreign countries when they haven't even been out for five years? If Asian horror is really the best form of the genre out there, why don't production companies buy distribution rights and show them stateside? Instead they spend that money to get rights and then invest even more to get actors and a production off the ground for a full-blown reshoot. I mean when has an American remake ever been better than the original? Yeah, that's right, never. The Ring was at least moderately interesting, I'm sure mostly due to Gore Verbinski's directing and ability to bring something new to the film. With Pulse, I have to believe the people involved just wanted to create a platform to get pretty people on screen to make a quick buck. Seriously, this film is repetitious and boring to the point where I thought I read the 90 minute playtime wrong, thinking I was at the two hour mark when I still had a half hour left.I will say one thing though, seeing this trash makes me want to see the original, Kairo, even more. If a film this bad could have a chance of being made, then the first incarnation must be a masterpiece, cause if it's as bad as this, I don't see why anyone would bother. This story is ripe with possibilities, as a frequency of ghosts has overtaken humanity through its ability to move through our wires and airwaves. The exposure to the problem of being connected worldwide, so well that it could spell extermination, is a fantastic idea to build a film around. While a TV show like "Battlestar Galactica" broaches the subject to the fact that they have been destroyed because the enemies superior prowess in technology allowed them to shut down the planet in the matter of minutes through the networks, Pulse only mentions the problem during the final voice-over, finishing the movie. "Battlestar" builds on the idea that our need to be Gods led us too close to the sun and therefore allows them to take a step back, dissolve networks and tunnels into their survival structure to find a way to stay alive. Unfortunately, rather than touch on the overreaching ego we humans have grown, the filmmakers decide to show people get killed one after the other in the exact same way the previous victim did. Not only do they miss the opportunity to make a plot line with some depth, they refuse to add a sense of spontaneity to get an audience's interest. A character sees the ghost, has his will to live sucked out, goes home to be found depressed by a friend, and ultimately kills himself or turns to ash. You can only stand seeing the same thing so many times.While the film itself was a disaster, there were some redeeming qualities, the best of which was the visual look and special effects. The pulse of electricity prevalent throughout was nice and the way the filmmakers dealt with the apparitions realistic and well done. Scenes like that which is depicted on the poster above were amazing to watch, especially the few dream sequences clouded in a fog with a hyper-stylized monochromatic color palette. Also, the acting wasn't so bad. Something about Kristen Bell annoys me, though. Whether it's the fact that she can go from very attractive to weird looking in the matter of one eye blink, I don't know. I will say the Avril Lavigne look was not becoming and totally wrong for the character it is that she plays, her acting however is good enough. Ian Somerhalder is pretty decent as well, albeit the same thing we've seen from him before. Besides a fantastic, yet brief appearance by the wonderful Brad Dourif, the real quality lies with Rick Gonzalez. Always someone that gets put in lackluster films, he seems to never fail in bringing a performance better than the movie itself. Usually just the comic relief as in Old School, the emotional resonance he exudes here is effective as it was in the decent Coach Carter. His scenes post- ghost-viewing are real good. It's just a shame that all the interesting characters fall so easily to the enemy when our two protagonists get cornered time and time again and seem to just be able to run away. Damn, why didn't the rest think of that? Run away?what a novel idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a guy who hacks in a computer which holds something so terrifying that it's spreading around the world. Now a group of friends will try to stop from the dead to come in the real world from our own technology.Technology is our main support to get through our world. It's practically with us everyday in our entire lives. Having put this in mind, what if ghosts are trying to contact us - trying to take over our world because of our technology which is the gateway to our world?Well, this is the point to the film.The acting by Kristen Bell is good. Although similar to White Noise, the entertainment value is a lot better in this film. In fact, Pulse is better than White Noise. This is an underrated film. The camera in the film is very slick. This entire look of the film looks fantastic.I did not watch this film in theaters but rented the unrated version, instead. I was expecting this film is be a really bad horror film but it turned out not so bad. There's a great scene that wasn't in the theatrical version of where a college students jump down on a tower to the floor. There are other good scenes like this that makes you squirm. Sometimes it's boring and sometimes it's enjoyable.So what if the plot is ridiculous? So what if it's a PG-13 horror film? It's not half as bad as everyone is saying it really is. It could've been a lot better, though. A good thing about this film is that there's no regular clichés in this film. The CGI effects are well in this film, too.If you're looking for a scary, terrifying film, this film will disappoint. It's not scary but it's disturbing and kinda enjoyable. The acting goes well for the cast and the vision of the film is slick. It's overall not a terrible remake so you should check it out if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge: Ring, Ring!: One Dark Watery Missed Call Part 3 (this rip-off remake is a time/money rip-off)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this Pulse remake, I was immediately became annoyed by (among other things) how this movie uses that same color bleaching and blue tint so common in some Asian horror movies and their American remakes. I wish if they were going to use this, that it would be at least a bit more motivated by the environmental conditions.The lines from Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral, "everything's blue in this world" came to mind. Funnily enough, I wasn't the only person for whom that was true - Brad Brevet's review for Rope of Silicon said the same thing.The original came highly recommended to me, but I found it disappointing overall, with just some haunting scenes. In Kairo (to call the original by its original title), people who have died and then reappear later are then subtly are replaced by black smudges on the walls. Given the Japanese origins of that film, some resonance with Hiroshima and Nagasaki is inevitable, the smudges left on walls by people who died in the nuclear blasts. In this remake, the effects are over the top, digital nonsense - blackness grabbing out of walls pulling people in, distorting their features, etc. The dead people sucking souls resemble Aphex Twin's Come to Daddy music video; some of them aren't even human, but some kind of mutants with human components (the one in the washing machine, for example).This remake is also one that seems mixed up with a number of other similar Asian horror movies and remakes. The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, One Missed Call - it's hard to remember which rip-off we're watching! I prefer ones that strike out into more unfamiliar territory, or really have a unique spin on the familiar.The movie rarely rings true. After someone commits suicide, one would expect the police to comb the apartment for a suicide note or indications of why the person might have committed suicide, and to take the means used. Instead, the means is left, the computer is left, it hasn't been cleaned, etc. The guy had no family, I guess? No funeral?When somebody else later starts talking the same way as the guy who killed himself, nobody thinks to personally check in on him right away. They seem not to care. When evidence of suicides is found on a computer, it's not taken to the police or the media (who say the string of suicides is unconnected), but kept a secret. When people see the message "Would you like to see a ghost?" on their computer, rather than assuming it's a virus, they click on it - and always on the word "to."Unexceptional acting. The lead female, Mattie (unisex name probably consciously chosen by writers familiar with "final girl" trope), is played by Lipglossie McMascara. Was there an actress underneath that cake? When she finds a black spot on her shirt, she automatically takes it off - never mind she had no qualms about holding her friend who was covered with some black disease moments before, or that she leaves on her raccoon eye makeup and black bra.In the end, I guess the movie has a neo-luddite/back to nature/human connectedness message, except I don't think the filmmakers were trying to make a message film, so it doesn't really work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, this Americanized version of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's film is just..americanized. The plot is essentially the same except completely elaborated upon instead of elusive like the Japanese film. We get all the information on why these ghosts do what they do and how they got here. Why the red tape is essential to keep them at bay, and also we learn how they travel. The ones that die turn into ash, but we actually see how the ghosts take over those who have to surrender their life force. Victims are left with only a shell of what was once a vibrant, living human being. Through technological means, they are able to seek out and destroy those who use such equipment as cell phones and computers.The numb skull who unleashes the "virus" is Josh(Jonathan Tucker), a master hacker who taps into these ghostly apparitions which roam free in our world taking the will to live from humans leaving them to slowly turn into eventual ash or to commit suicide because the pain as they dies drives them into a deep abyss of depression(as one victim friend of our heroine Mattie explains..the slowly dying tastes like lead with each breath taken). Mattie(Kristen Bell..I like her, but she deserves a better vehicle to express her talent which is unfortunately dormant in dread like this movie)is Josh's girlfriend and through her we see the chaos that erupts thanks to the ghosts that lurk as clear shadows(almost like river pool ripples we can see appear in moments). After Josh's death, Dexter(Iam Somerhalder)receives his computer and finds out what Josh was up to finding a video diary mentioning a computer guy named Ziegler. Ziegler might hold the knowledge on how they came unto this world and how to stop them. Also, Dexter finds a possible computer part that might execute the virus of ghosts that Josh had hidden in a safe place on his computer. We see a city in complete desolate ruin where nearly an entire populations is gone.The film strip is drained of color like other Americanized remakes of Japanese films and for once I'd like to see a film show vibrant colors. This film looks like it was shot on the outskirts of Antarctica or something..completely dreary and lifeless. The characters have no life, the cast is going through the motions. The film has no energy or heart. When you pay more attention to how great Bell looks in her tight jeans than what her character is going through in the movie, something is indeed wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst advice ever from a college counsellor, the funniest thing ever to fall out of a tumble drier and the worlds most pivotal USB drive, make for some of the lowlights here.Pulse takes the techno-fear CGI crap-fest genre to a new low, with a dreary, colourless effort of a film that consists of series of increasingly funnier and shittier encounters with a crackling bald man made of TV screen static.The upshot of it all, is that this ghostly cross-platform virus monster pops out of your PC/cell phone/ PDA/ (in much the same way as the lass out of the ring movies flops out of TV's- although less effectively) and turns a selection of lifeless, drippy nerds into some stains.On walls, chairs, car seats, etc. The monsters in this film turn you into a smudge. Or you commit suicide first. Its not explained well really.Unsurprisingly it wipes out almost all of the nerdy students before any regular people spot anything awry.The intensely irritating ghost apparently drains the will to live from the victim - much like the film itself (cheap shot - my bad) And from the opening scene (surely no one could read a word in a library that badly lit!) you know you are about to be regularly assaulted by noisy blurting MTV visuals featuring Jacob's ladder-esquire, speeded up shots of shuffling bald idiots, trying to pass themselves off as scare scenes.No amount of stupid looking under-lit geeks grovelling in front of web-cams, will ever be scary, and the threat from the nebulous crackling static man, is so CGI that its difficult to give a toss.The main problem is the film takes itself so seriously with such a dour humourless approach to the whole scenario, lacking any kind of irony or intelligence, that its apocalyptic ambitions are hollow and distinctly unimpressive.Which is a pity - as the premise is vaguely Lovecraftian, as these ghosts come to slaughter nerds through a wide bandwidth frequency "from Beyond" - with a bit more time spent on developing this idea, it could have been a lot more interesting.About an hour and seventeen minutes in, a frantic race with pounding music attempts to drag this pedestrian dross into some form of life, but by then its too late, and a gurning cameo from Brad Dourif sadly only reminds us that his B-movie career far outweighs his successes in film.What the film lacks in IT savvy terror, it less than compensates for with splatter - of which there is also none at all.To top it all, there's obviously an unsubtle attempt at pointing out how reliant on communication technology we are, but like the rest of the film, its such a redundantly shallow point, devoid of character or wit, that its unsatisfying and hollow.Someone should have pressed alt+F4 on the whole thing somewhere along the line. I can only presume the original is superior - its hard to imagine a worse attempt at this techno-invasion idea - but I now feel no compulsion to watch it.overall 9/10 kidding 4/10 really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Pulse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched the original movie which Pulse is based upon. As is the current trend, Asian horror movies are being adapted or remade by their western counterparts at a rapid pace in an attempt to offer something different in style of the genre to its own audiences. If you haven't watched Kairo, you might think that Pulse is genius. If you had watched Kairo however, and didn't like it, this remake will make you appreciate the original a whole lot more. If you liked Kairo, then Pulse is a blasphemy, whether or not you're a purist.While the original is measured in its delivery, keeping its cards close to its chest while the story developed, Pulse suffers from the dumbing down of plot to cater to the masses - any theme and everything is explained like an instruction manual, and this goes right down to offering some kind of a decent explanation of what exactly is happening, and creates a weak origin to go along too. From the onset, within the first ten minutes, it smacks the ideas of communication and modern day isolation so in your face, you wonder what else are they gonna cover as the movie progressed.Luckily it lasts a little less than 90 minutes, and somehow sustained interest with its nicely done special effects, which you cannot deny is much superior to Kairo, made 5 years ago. However, nifty special effects isn't sufficient to gloss over a serious lack of effort in delivery to make this be at least as creepy as the original. Contrasted with the simple effects of shadowy figures, and the atmospheric chilling mood in Kairo, which you do not get to feel at all when watching Pulse, it degenerates this movie into a level of generics.As with all remakes, some liberties are taken to create new characters, or recreate some from an amalgamation of others. From the trailers you do see iconic scenes taken from Kairo lock stock and barrel, but somehow didn't make the final cut, or was modified. There were some nice touches though, in their recreation of the dank apartment where the first signs of trouble surfaced.Are there any good points at all? Compared to Kairo, this one is paced faster, because of its action sequences with the showing of the ghouls. So for those with attention disorder, its lack of lingering scenes will make Pulse more palatable to you. But one thing that really stuck out like a sore thumb, is its use of pop music, wiping away any sense or attempts at creating a horror movie truly dependent on mood, which is what made Asian horror stand out against the usual western horror movies in the first place.All in all, I think it's about time remakes cool off the factory floor. If anything, Pulse should generate some interest on Kairo, and allow those who backtrack, discover the genius of the original Kiyoshi Kurosawa masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie not expecting too much, and that was exactly what i got. No one in the movie theater seemed frightened at any parts, and i believe i heard more laughs than screams. Which should be embarrassing to Wes Craven and the director, because the movie was trying to be serious, but only instilled laughter.It seemed at first the movie was trying to be like the Ring(Maybe The Ring 2, since that was just as bad as pulse), with all the camera angles. There was actually a part in the movie where a lady started walking towards the camera , exactly the same way the little girl does in the ring. But then the movie tried to switch gears midway, and it tried to become a movie like 28 days later. Except that movie was actually believable. In the pulse you had no feeling for the characters, and you could care less what happened to them which partly may have been because of the bad acting (who are these people?).Overall the movie was very disappointing,and really confusing. Nothing really made since, and didn't follow a certain pattern. The one thing that really annoyed me was the fact that people kept disappearing, but all the other characters did not seem to notice and just went on with there everyday life. It is too bad I didn't go see Talladega Nights instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's got the cast so down in "Pulse"? The screenplay, of course</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was happy to discover as I entered 'Theater 2' this afternoon, that there were very few people attending this movie besides me. With my buddy we numbered six, no joke, but you can laugh anyway because we sure did.And we didn't laugh to make the experience any less frightening, we did it to get some entertainment out of this dead horse. Actually, seeing a real dead horse probably would've scared me more than this film.It's nice watching a movie like this if a halfway decent actor shows up, and luckily one did eventually (Ian Somerhalder), though his performance wasn't all that wonderful. But, hell, compared to the other actors he was a deity.Kristen Bell leads the show in this depressing, dimly shot flick. And she likes to gaze away, stare intently at someone/something, or pretend she actually cares about whatever's gobbling up her stereotypical college friends (and the whole city for that matter) like candy corn."Red tape keeps them out. I don't know why" Her emo boyfriend says through a sticky note pasted onto a generous amount of the adhesive stuff inside of his social security box. What does it keep out? Why the ghosts of course. Or are they some sorta electronic frequency? In the end, it doesn't matter. The spirit/virus/signal/pulse/horror movie cliché wants to suck everyone into the underworld, and I don't mean the one Kate Beckinsale lives in. You're better off accepting the ghost-things as typical evil monsters than trying to figure them out, because once you do come to a conclusion, like I did, you'll realize that it DOES NOT matter what they are because they still devour people in this movie all the same.However, as one of Kristen's friend's points out, the ghosts want life again and will try to "infect" you in an attempt to get it back. Neat concept.That's why it had already been done to death in countless movies before...My real question for this movie is why there are apparently only evil ghosts. Are we all supposed to become spiteful, pale demons that prey upon our living kindred when we die? This, too, doesn't really matter at all.There are plenty of "Boo!" scares and some weird images, but this isn't anything new. The horror franchise thrives on that stuff.After the long opening credits (think of "Firewall") the movie unfolds with a scene that looks very much like it belonged in the *middle* of the movie. Wes Craven thinks he's clever by sllllloooooowwwwwwlllllyyy revealing one little answer after another and tries explaining this awkward beginning to keep the audience from going "Huh?" most of the time. He also cannot write dialogue to save his life, or maybe that was his non-Japanese partner whose name you will read in place of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's like the movie's main page here on IMDb advertises. All this adds up to is another force-fed Hollywood plot that left me feeling as empty as the depressed characters in this movie.Maybe the ghosts got to me? If they did I guess they panicked and left me alone after they realized how bland of a movie I was watching."Why do I care about any of this?" is a good thing to remember throughout this film. Nothing is worth figuring out because you, and the movie, won't give a care by the end of it all.Just a waste of time. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes I must admit that the comparisons between the other Japanese horror remakes are inevitable with our blonde heroine and her companions coworkers friends family (depending on the movie) fighting a growing evil force entity presence (again depending on the movie). Also the movie itself is a fairly derivative work, except for where the bad guys are hiding, though there are a few examples that come to mind, Ghost in the Machine being one of the more obvious (run on sentences anyone?). However, the performances are very good perhaps even in spite of the implausibility quotient and if you don't think about it too much there a a couple of good jolts, and a few scary moments. Although the ending lacks a real kicker and there isn't much sequel potential It's a passable way to spend your 90 minutes.</fullReview>

Okay i didn't see the original, But i saw The Grudge and the ring still..Pulse was good cause it didn't have blood or stuff like that, but It was OK so far.But i love horror films a lot, as much as i love blood like the movie The Descent, that movie creeped me out, i loved that one but Pulse Hmm something was missing....maybe cause it was on the internet? I don't know but i give pulse a 5/10 that's all i can say. Well I'm sorry but this is my choice and for The descent i would rate that movie 7 on 10. One last thing about Pulse, I like how they did the Ghosts (spirits) and into The Descent the creatures were simply more horrifying.Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as it's being made out to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pulse, the remake of the Japanese film Kairo, seems to be getting a bad rap. Personally, flaws and all, I enjoyed it.The acting was nothing special as far as I'm concerned. The cast, while not exactly chosen for their acting abilities, performed decently (with some exceptions) and there were no points (save perhaps Zieglar's explanation scene and the landlady scene) that made me cringe - that's always a good thing.The scares are mostly shock scares - loud noises, disturbing imagery flashed for brief seconds. Nothing to leave you with nightmares, seeing as how what, in my opinion, would have been the most psychologically scary aspect of the movie (the video feeds of the ghosts in various poses, ala The Ring + web cams) was downplayed in favor of the shock-based scares, which are not without their own fun merit. The freakish ghoul that terrorized Isabell in the laundry room was very cool. The initial wet laundry chucking should have been laughable, but I still found myself on the edge of my seat.I didn't like that most of the 'major' players were killed off with as little screen time as possible but with the rate of devastation unleashed by the time the end of the movie rolls around, I guess it's only natural to assume that people were just dying (or fading to ash) left and right at the time.Some of the techno babble flaws are pretty silly. In fact, the whole concept behind the 'invasion' is pretty silly but in no way is it worse than any other reasonably decent horror movie thats come out recently. Don't let that dissuade you from seeing this. Most average horror fans will enjoy it on at least a visceral level because when it does scares, it does them pretty well, for the most part. The deeper message of the film may be lost on most but it's there.Which brings me to the serious issues that this movie, in my opinion, addressed. While they may not have come across perfectly, they were presented pretty well. The first major issue addressed (although both are interconnected) is the rise and dominance of the electronic application in our daily lives. Cell phones, PDAs, computers, etc. The movie's warning is that we've become so immersed in this digital world that if something were to go wrong with it (such as, say, ghosts using computers, cell phone signals, and wifi to travel around and suck out human energy). During the movie, I felt like they over saturated this aspect - everyone was always on their device of choice: at the club, in class, at home, etc, but then I thought about it and realized that it was a pretty accurate portrayal of a world where someone will text message someone ten feet away to try and borrow their PSP.Secondly, an issue brought up and addressed (somewhat unsuccessfully) was the issue of how this new world of technology creates loneliness in human beings, particularly the youth. We see people so tied down to their machines that their level of social interaction begins to deteriorate. People are recluses in their rooms, chatting with people online but alone all the same. As Mattie says at one point, her relationship with her (soon to be dead) ex-boyfriend Josh was reduced to text messages back and forth. When Isabell goes to the laundry room and sees one other girl there, she makes the comment that it seem's like she's the only person left living in the building and asks what everyone is doing tonight. The girl replies with a blunt "I don't go out much." That seems to be the underlying statement of this movie. Social interaction is slowly dying out. People are becoming more alone even as they become more connected to the world.Truly, as the movie progresses, we get an idea of this loneliness expanding. As more and more people resort to suicide or get sucked into walls as black ash, the once vibrant college campus becomes desolate - classes empty, the main entrance way bleak and lifeless. We can assume this is a small example of what is happening on a large scale but the movie doesn't attempt to show that nor should it have. Instead we have dreary shots of lifeless apartment complexes and red taped windows, desolate classrooms and a blue tint that has become so much a staple of horror movies that I can't wait to see a new horror movie without any sort of color tinting on it.Overall, decent enough scare flick with a semi-unconventional ending (at least they don't try and brawl with the ghosts ala Michael Keaton in the terrible White Noise, a similar themed technology gone bad flick, with three times the laughs and two times the bad). Don't expect TOO much of it or you might be disappointed. If you like shock horror, you'll have a fun time with this. It's not the best horror movie in recent times, but it's nowhere near as bad as some of these reviews make it out to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the WORST remakes I've ever seen. :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SHOJ!!!!!! Watch the special features and you'll get it. Man this movie is retarded. The ENTIRE FILM with only ONE exception (the scene where the girl talks to the dude outside next to his car) is filmed in some stupid colored lighting. Shows that the DP and director have no real vision for this film and that they just wanted things to look dramatic rather than trying to light it in a way that might highlight the point of the scenes or show any kind of progression for the characters during the film.And dude...all the hands???? Do we REALLY need a GIGANTIC FACE MADE OF HANDS AND ARMS!?!??!!? What is the freaking point? It's retarded. My friends and I watched this as a B-movie. It was hilarious. There's no way I can take this movie seriously. Sure Ms. Bell is a super hottie and all (:D), but a cute girl does not a good movie make! In fact this film has almost nothing to do with the original Japanese film. Yeah the plot is similar and all but the pacing is made super fast...as though an American audience can't sit still and watch the movie or something. The writing on this film is awful (thank you very much Wes Craven), as the characters freak out way more than they need to in order to get the point across. The ending is similar but the original is better in every single way. Let's look at the part where the person jumps from the tower as the main character turns around to see. In the Japanese version the person is climbing up the tower, everything's normal. It's also a STILL single shot. When they finally jump you look over and HOLY CRAP, they just leaped out. In the American version we have to FOCUS on the death rather than the main character. The camera is MUCH MUCH CLOSER to the person and PANS DOWN watching the person as they fall. This focuses more on the dead person rather than the horrifying circumstance of the death as witnessed by the main character. In the Japanese version we watch the person die as someone seeing it on the street by chance. In the American version they FORCE you to focus on the person dying.....which is pointless, and retarded.This is just a SINGLE SCENE where this kind of stupid "remaking attitude" comes into play. The entire film is filled with scenes that are similar to the original but much sillier after being redone. Plus, people seem to not only miss the POINT of these original films but also miss the pacing, the actual way that the drama is handled between the characters and the focus (like I mentioned in the last paragraph) is ALWAYS in the wrong place and always for the wrong reasons. There's even a part near the end of the film where the main guy and girl go into a room where this guy taped everything over with red. Well in the original Japanese version of the film they didn't have to cover the ENTIRE ROOM and light everything to look blood red...because they probably thought it'd be stupid...which it is. Anyway, so there's this guy in there who is freaking out. In the original film there's a similar scene (I think, it's been a while since I've seen it) but in that scene he's upset. He's not certifiable. The guy in this version is CRAZY. He goes on and on and EXPLAINS EVERYTHING having to do with anything...as though the audience didn't realize what was happening and for some reason ALSO lacked the mental capacity to put ANYTHING they've seen throughout the rest of the film together. The entire scene is pointless from a writing standpoint. There's no reason to explain every single thing in a horror film. In fact the mystery is often what keeps the film scary, not like this movie had either of those qualities in the first place. We once again turn to Wes Craven. HOW oh HOW can you fall so far Wes? The original Hills Have Eyes from the 70's is a GREAT movie, and now you're churning out this fecal surprise? Did you have some contractual obligation to work on this for some reason? Man, get some talent back dude, cuz you've lost it all.Sadly it's not just THIS remake that does "get it" either. Too many (pretty much ALL of them from the past few years) miss the point, drop the ball, and go left on Awful Avenue straight into Suck City. There's nothing good I can say about this film except that it's REALLY GOOD..........for a laugh...many laughs actually. And that Kristin Bell is a super hottie. Other than that, it's just too funny.I give this film ZERO stars out of FOUR. And on a B-Movie scale I give this film....oh THREE out of FOUR I guess. It's really quite funny with your buddies, just don't expect anything of quality from it. Why am I still typing anything about this terrible movie? What is wrong with me? Why are you still reading!? Either go watch it, and have a laugh or stay away and don't have a good laugh session.</fullReview>

I am not easily frightened by most movies, and this one did it, (rated pg-13) i might add.There was a loose end or two and maybe a couple of minutes where i found myself wondering what was going on, but it all comes together in the end, and await the sequel, (if ever there is to be one, I HOPE) Its worth the rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the incredibly creepy tailer for "Pulse" while at the movies, and couldn't wait to see it. The cinematography was stunning and the film itself looked very interesting. It wasn't just your average horror. This was end of the world (evacuate your homes) horror! So did the movie live up to it's 2 minute trailer? - indeed it did. "Pulse" was one of the scariest movies of 2007.Some will probably pass this by, targeting it as "Another Japanese remake." I understand why. Though I'm a fan of "The Grudge", "The Ring", etc.. The idea does get some what tiresome. More and more of these popular Japanese stories, legends are being remade for American audiences. Some say there is no need. They look at it the same way as remaking a cult classic such as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." - Why bother? Others on the other hand (myself) think remaking cult classics &amp; popular Japanese movies is a great idea. A lot of people today will not watch Japanese films - simply because of the subtitles. Many won't watch old horror movies because they feel it's too dated. So I think bringing those great stories back to the silver screen is a great idea. Whether they do any justice to the original - that's a different story."Pulse" (In my opinion) is one of the better Japanese remakes. But sadly the film received mostly negative reviews. The thing I realised was, most people weren't targeting the actual movie, it was like I said before. They were bored of the whole Japanese thing. So It was very overlooked. If it had been released before "The Ring", or "The Grudge" - the rating and reviews would have been a lot higher.The movie is very different from it's other contenders. Some will be happy to hear the movie doesn't feature a little girl/woman with long black hair and bulging red eyes. It's also not based on a curse. The evil was hatched from a virus in a computer. It unleashed these powerful, nightmare monsters, abeling them to get you through your phones, lap tops, wi-fi etc.. Things that we use in our ever day lives.The monsters are very different - they're normal people. Only they're body's have been drained. They drain everything that makes you, you. So all you wanna do is die. Then you become "one of them." The monsters are very haunting. They are genuinely frightening. There's no lurking in the shadows, spying on you. When they want you - they're gonna get you.Kristen Belle plays the lead female "Maddie". A young girl in college, who suddenly starts to realise somethings going on. Kristen is a great actress and she showed a whole different side of herself on here. When your a star of your own TV show (Veronica Mars) it's difficult to break that mold. To not be the same character everyone knows you for. To appear as someone else. Kristen did an amazing job. Her acting is very genuine. Very real. She brings real emotion and character to this movie - plus she can scream in almost 10 different ways. The rest of the cast all did a superb job. Especially the talented singer/actress "Christina Milian" - she surprised me in this movie. She's very natural and has a great screen presence.All in all "Pulse" is a top notch horror flick. Great script, great acting, great CGI, great suspense - the list goes on.If you want to be truly scared. Put down "The Ring" and snatch "Pulse" - you wont be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually quite enjoyed this film. I don't see why so many people hated it. It didn't terrify me or anything, but I thought the concept was pretty good. The way it was filmed, special effects, actors, writing, and special effects I also enjoyed.Many people say that this film copied off of other movies such as Fear Dot Com and others. I did indeed see some similarities. But what with the millions and millions of films out there now of course your gonna come across movies that are similar. And in my own personal opinion I think this movie was better than the ones people say it "copied off of".I'll admit that at first I didn't quite get how in the begin everything was so slow moving and only a few people died, but at the end half the world was gone. I thought things moved WAY too fast for me. But then I thought about what it would be like if this really did happen and I believed it.So, I think that if you haven't seen this movie you should at least give it a shot and ignore all the negative comments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Pulse' follows up on the recent surge of American adaptations of Japanese horror flicks. The problem with following up on a trend is simple to see: if you're the first person to try a new thing (such as those bringing the coolly creepy sensibility of Japanese horror to American shores), you're going to try to choose the very best material ("Ringu") to get the very best results ("The Ring"). Then, when later people come along and try to duplicate that success ("The Grudge," "Dark Water," and now "Pulse"), they're going to have a harder time, because they are NOT working with the best material, but with the stuff you passed over the first time through.So it is with "Pulse." While "The Ring" offered a real sense of controlled story (other than that miserable final sequence), the key word for "Pulse" is "excess." The supposed undergraduate-age protagonists are TOO pretty, TOO hip (and a good deal TOO old), and way TOO connected to their cell phones. Look, I teach college for a living. I see real students, in California no less, in their native environment. NOBODY acts like these tech-heavy clowns.Yes, I know it's all to prove the political point of the film ("technology BAD"), but what it seems like is laziness. Like too many badly done horror movies, the protagonists are so godawfully smug about their sophistication in the face of creepy happenings that by the time people start getting their faces chewed off, we're really willing for it to happen to them.Ah well. Maybe someone somewhere has some better material for American adaptors. Bollywood horror, anyone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Expected Awful, I Got Awful... So Is That Good or Bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young woman (Kristen Bell) tries to track down her boyfriend, only to find he commit suicide by hanging himself with a phone cord. But that's just on the surface... a weird technological virus has been unleashed that kills people off through the powers of the Internet and cell phones.This film was riddled with failure before it even got off the ground. Kirsten Dunst was supposed to star, but she was not able to... so they got her less costly doppelganger, Kristen Bell. (Although, with all due respect, Bell was a great actress in this... she just appeared in an awful movie.) Wes Craven was set to direct, then bailed out, leading the film to be officially canceled for a while. What project is so bad Craven runs from it? My friend Jason and I debate the careers of Craven and John Carpenter, with my contention that Carpenter has failed for the last ten years. But Craven came back to this one (though not as director) and it will be a blemish on a record that was already failing. Wes, my friend, what have you become? Horror movie icons Kane Hodder and Brad Dourif also appear... and make no impact.Bob Weinstein canceled the film considering it to be too similar to "The Ring". When do the Weinsteins hide from easy money? They, too, came crawling back... but the point was all too accurate. Not only are some of "The Ring"'s aspects in here, but "Stay Alive" and "Fear Dot Com" show up, too. So, um, when will we get a new movie about technology that isn't derivative? Some people have talked up the "tower suicide" scene, which is allegedly the best part of the Japanese version. Well, I can't speak for the Japanese version, but this one can be summed up in one word: weak. The suicide was nothing compared to the hanging from "The Omen", for example.The best part, in my opinion, was with the nutty diner man scene where Kristen Bell says, "You're freaking us out, man. You need some booze in your coffee." But this part was comedic, not even horror at all, and could have worked well in any movie.A theme of this film is technology, and particularly dangers that can arise from technology out of control. Unfortunately, there is no real social critique here... no one would reasonably believe ghosts would merge from cell phones and laundromats. Better critiques have been made by a plethora of movies and books -- not this one. I hear that the Japanese version plays down the technology and focuses more on "isolation" and on how technology disconnects us from the world. That theme is not only more realistic, but more adaptable to horror -- the best horror involves isolation and hopelessness.Am I being too harsh on this movie? I don't think so, because it made little sense, wasn't overly intelligent, and wasn't even scary. I think the filmmakers counted on the popularity of Bell ("Vronica Mars") and Ian Somerhalder (Boone from "Lost") to drive this film home, but even their decent acting cannot save this hodge podge of banality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the moment this movie opens, i could tell it was going to be a horrible movie. The special effects are great as with the cinematography but it just wast scary. The lead actress, the blond chick from some TV show, was horrible. I don't understand why actors don't ask what scene proceeds the one they are currently shooting. Her fake crying was horrible and when she tried to be scared, it only lasted a few seconds. Plus, there are major plot inconsistencies that i need not mention for you will find out when you see it. This movie also borrows heavily from the ring and tries very hard to make it scary but again, it just doesn't work. i should have listened to the advice given on this website, there is a reason it has such a low rating, its horrible. Pulse, has left me searching for a vein.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably one of the stupidest Movies of all time. Nothing was plausible, such a far leap in the suspension of disbelief. I really tried to enjoy it, but there was no way, the movie has to be at least somewhat believable. The dialogue was so generic. And, some scenes were so dumbed down, it was insulting. Solid story, but a stupid story. Some of the CG work was pretty cool. But you can have the greatest graphics in the world, but if the Story has no significance then what's the use. Also, why do the black people always die horrible deaths in these movies ? So cliché. I say the only redeeming element of this film was the...uhmm.. the blonde chick. Don't waste your time or money on a movie like this unless you're another director or screenwriter and you wanna learn what NOT to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie of '06</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... I wonder if any of the people involved with this film, from the actors to the producers to the dolly tech, even watched this film once it was " completed" . This was absolutely the worst film of the year; I am so disappointed.Continuity was awful. There were numerous wardrobe and prop changes through the whole flick. strangers knew each others names without introducing themselves. I think it was due to poor editing ( probably to cut time down), it felt like the beginning and end of many scenes were just missing leaving the audience to assume things.The acting was just poor in general. Timing was so off in sections I wanted to laugh, but I was too nauseous to attempt a chuckle. Emotions were forced, and too over the top. I blame this entirely on th director, because I have seen great performances by most of the cast especially Kristen Bell.Cinematography was pathetic, there was no single style to the film. there were multiple ones borrowed and pasted together atrociously. there was an abundance of shots that would open with Kristens chest, which I found appallingly childish. If this were a slasher film where it was all about blood and tits I'd accept it, but it was shot as a Japanese horror mostly( not to mention that K.B. is pretty "average" in that area anyway).The whole plot was way too egotistical which might sound weird in print, but watch and you'll understand. Pulse's predecessors ( Ring, Grudge, Dark water, Uzumaki etc...) are all centered around a very minute amount of victims ( for lack of better term). Pulse is basically your average Zombie where it starts small spreads uncontrollably and affects the majority of the planet, except instead of Zombies we get pixelized ghosts. On top of it's over-dramaticness it doesn't really even make sense. These ghosts supposedly " want what they don't have.... life", but in no way do they ever achieve any sort of reincarnation. All they do is suck the will to live from the living. Doesn't seem like to big of a deal but i just can't let it slide. A good director or screenwriter would include how they attack mercilessly and obsessively because they don't achieve life.I know Japanese remakes have never given us incredible movies, but the debate is usually whether or not you personally where scared by it. This movie just completely stinks of Uwe Boll or something. I'm serious when I say this movie is right on par with Manos: Hands of Fate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The colors are washed out in an effort, I believe, to give the plot a sort of impending peril. The blue/gray tone was very hard on my eyes. There were no frightening scenes, nothing new, and I wouldn't even watch this movie for free on television. There were a couple of bright spots. The brightest spot had to be the acting of Christina Milian. She is, in my jaded opinion, an awesome actress. The computer graphics of the city are also quite well done. It appeared to me that the closeups of the main characters showed that many were wearing a surfeit of makeup. I am aware that Ms. Bell is a very beautiful young lady, but I believe the makeup obscured her naturally pretty face. I saw the movie for five dollars and at least I was in an air conditioned theater for two hours while my friends were shopping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pulse sucked. I can't say that enough. Maybe if it was the original Japanese version that they put in theaters instead of this boring re-hash then I would've been pleased. But no, this piece of crap masquerading as a promising remake is not worth anyone's time.God, what did they do to the wonderful creepy nature of the original? OK, let me tell you why I was so disappointed by this flick. In the original version, there is a striking subtlety. Once Pandora's box is open, it slowly starts to take effect and before you know it the planet is beyond saving. It's bleak, it's a nightmare. In the American version it is completely dumbed down and the filmmakers have done something akin to treating the audience like children as they hold your hand and walk you through exactly what happened. The Japanese version catered to a more mature crowd and did not rely on the typical jump/scare tactic that seems to define horror films these days. Oh, and that cast!Kristen Bell is a dopey beautiful woman. I don't know if she is dopey in real life but in this film, she was hardcore dopey. Wait, I don't mean dopey, I mean forlorn?you could see how I might confuse the two if you watch the film in question. Needless to say, she is just the concerned girlfriend of the first victim of them?this is worse than pulling teeth. Them = Ghosts. See, this guy has been unreachable by phone or e-mail for the last few days and you know what that means in this high tech world. That man is DEAD! So, Bell's character, Mattie Webber, goes to investigate. She finds him alive, relatively speaking. Something's wrong with him, he's not himself. His apartment is a mess and he's got this awful looking sore by his neck. He seems distant, not concerned with anything like it's not worth it. Finally, he leaves the living room where they've been talking and he proceeds to hang himself. Mattie is traumatized from there.News spreads about the young man's death to all the friends and a few days later when Mattie and her closest friends are on a live chat Josh messages them: "Help me" is all he says.This is when the film just turns into The Ring and they call it a night. Kids run away from ghosts who walk/glitch towards you and who suck your will to live, rather than your soul (perhaps because the "will to live" is 30% less fattening!). The movie is naturally dark and kind of grimy but the gravity of the ghosts, and how menacing they are, is handled so poorly. These are not scary creatures. They do scary things here and there but on the whole they're just dudes and gals looking like junkies in white make-up and clearly digitally mocked up for added Zao!!In the original version the ghosts looked like human beings from a distance until you started to notice that they were slightly blurred as they move towards you. The CGI shading in the original was more subtle. Also, they moved in the strangest slow motion. When you saw the otherworldly spirit it was something that literally forced you to rub your eyes because you couldn't believe what was moving towards you. The reactions of the Japanese actors to the ghosts were stellar, genuine and you really felt sorry for each victim. Here, in the American version, you don't give a damn about any of the characters and the ghosts are just so uninspired in terms of appearance and movement.A few actors that surprised me, not only for taking part in this crap fest but also for being so bad in it, included Ian Somerhalder who was amazing in Rules of Attraction but has since taken up acting lessons from Neo. I swear, he says a few single lines just like the, oh so, esteemed Keanu and it made me laugh each time it happened. Samm Levine, who was a really fantastic cad in Freaks &amp; Geeks is just a shell of his former self (maybe the ghosts got to him when the camera wasn't rolling). Ron Rifkin, who played Sloan on Alias, is Mattie's shrink who just yells at her as treatment. Even Joseph Gatt as Dark Figure could've been a whole lot darker, way to hold back, Gatt! I must admit though, Christina Milian is so utterly sexy even when she gets dirty a little later into the movie. There is a part where she gets some black soot like substance on her or whatever. Anyway, she looks awesome throughout. But she really didn't do a great job as Mattie's friend. The only character that I really felt sorry for was Rick Gonzalez's Stone. Man, it sucks being a minority! I feel your pain, brother! You didn't survive War of the Worlds either. Sucks dude. Anyway, stay away from this movie. Wes Craven?start directing again, properly. You produce bad, bad movies, my friend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Saw the movie Pulse yesterday. Although it did have some good parts, i found the plot line to be very hard to follow, the scenes were short, it jumped from one idea to the next with no real story, it went from people committing suicide, to a video feed online, to these, things (ghosts?) not being able to get through red tape, you cant even figure out what is going on and how this got started till Mattie and that one dude go and talk to a paranoid little geek named Ziegler. They're talking to him for a couple minutes, and then leave, he has no real part in the movie, and you are supposed to think he is important. By the end, when Mattie turns on her phone and sees there's a signal, the things, attack. If They Had Just gone to an Amish town none of this would have hyphened, the story lacks plot, and a story line, I do NOT recommend this movie to any of you.....i found it to be a waste of time...after seeing it, my friends and i made many jokes about it....such as red tape...and that if they had had dial up, the things that killed everyone...wouldn't't have killed them....cause dial up sucks....JUST LIKE THE MOVIE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmm...Well this movie goes down in other horror movie clichés' as wait for the scary moment to jump out and get ya. But this movie does that pretty poorly. I waited for something to happen before the movie finished but it never came through. It seemed like this movie was to scare you out of not doing so many electronic things in your everyday life. But instead I want to do it that much more if this message gets across all frequencies...even the dead ones...to say that this movie leaves very little to be desired.I felt that it had a lot of plot holes but continued on without anything to explain the initial story of ghosts coming through from electronics. People will lose their soul, act weird, then disappear. The red tape I felt became useless in the story. The end of the world has to do with Wi-Fi. Characters did the usual check out an empty or dark space despite being chased by something that's coming after them. I'm starting to think cyberspace should be left alone on the ghost spectrum for a while because White noise carried on for a bit but got across a point while this movie dragged across a story that has a hard time explaining itself. Also the tension failed. It seemed like it wanted to be quicker and better than other horror movies but suffers greatly by the bad rise in tension.But as the dead want life in this movie, I say I want my life and money from this movie. Now I'm gonna insult the message of this cyber virus of a movie and check my Myspace.</fullReview>

The only down side was that once people start dying, other than the main character and the one guy, they start dying like crazy. The whole country being infested by the dead was kind of a stretch but it was a cool addition. Most horror movies keep the evil in one house or one city, but Pulse allowed the horror to go anywhere it wanted. The laundry room part was pretty cool and it scared the crap out of me and my girlfriend. It had a great opening with the library part. When he moves the book and the face is there it is just so cool. The red tape kind of made a cool thing. Who would have ever thought of using red tape to keep the dead out?! Plus the whole idea of them coming out of our electronic devices made an even cooler story. But all in all I would give Pulse a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing Pulse one thing stood out in my mind above all else. The absolutely unforgivably awful acting. I would say that the leads in this film seem to have been cast simply on looks but even the normal or downtrodden looking secondary and background characters are terrible. In addition the characters are predictable annoying and seem to have been spewed out of the random horror movie character generator.Bad acting is only one of the many pitfalls that make Pulse unwatchable. The story seems to have been hastily conceived. It borrows the basic idea from the Japanese original and tries to differentiate itself by adding distinctly Hollywood plot elements. Unfortunately they seem extremely out of place in what should be a highly atmospheric fairly slow moving dreary film. The film suffers pacing issues as well. It blows through everything so fast the eeriness and apocalyptic feel of the original is completely lost. I would think that anyone who hadn't seen the original would sit in the theater wondering how a few college kids not showing up for class turns into the end of civilization in about thirty minutes or less.Special effects seem to be the main focus here. Problem is they aren't very good. Nothing in Pulse is it all falls somewhere between the awful and the mediocre. Don't waste the money the time or the braincells.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i am not a fan of horror movies and now i know why...the movie has several heart throbbing moments but the plot is not there...i feel like i wasted an hour and a half on my life on nothing...it was obvious this was a Japanese spin off...filmmakers need to understand that the ring is the only movie that we like from our pacific friends....i would not even want a role in this movie if they offered it...totally too much hype for a waste of time....it started out really well and suddenly got really stupid....there were people walking out the movie thirty minutes before it was over....what happened to the good old scary American movies...i still do not know what the movie was about...i would rather watch the outer limits</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thumbs Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, myself, am a fan of Kristen Bell and her work. This was one of the first reasons i thought this movie was going to be pretty good. But as i watched it, i was very disappointed. First off, you RARELY see the guys in this film. It's made up of mainly 3 characters the whole time- Mattie (Bell), Izzy (Milian), and Dexter (Somerhalder). The rest of the "main" characters are killed with in the first 30 minutes of the movie. The movie is basically about a group of friends that receive a bunch of creepy IMs from their deceased friend, Josh (Tucker). All of the friends survive except for Mattie. But she isn't alone. She befriended Dexter when he started to explain all of the creepy things on Josh's computer (how that bonded them together as friends, i have no idea). The ending is basically them driving and Mattie explaining why the will to live is so great. It was a very, very, disappointing movie. Another upsetting thing is that you never got to understand the backgrounds of the characters. Their personalities are never shown, with the exception of the first 5 minutes of the movie. I highly DO NOT recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What...the...HELL?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I love scary movies. Lately, I have been upset by the content and lack of "scare" in most movies out, but this movie takes the cake on sucking. It started out a little jumpy. My friend screamed. It was annoying. Not as annoying as the story line for this movie. OK, brace yourselves for the horror. The creepy scary bad thing in this movie...was a computer virus that GASP takes your will to live! Oh God! Say it is not true! It starts with Veronica Mars' bf and then gradually everyone in the world gets it minus a few people who make it to a "no service area" where the will to live taker can't get you. So basically, this will to live sucking virus takes over and the human race goes and lives in the prairie with no technology whatsoever. Cause some virus wants your will to live. What a stupid stupid stupid idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(barely a) PULSE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite possibly one of the worst movies that has ever been made and released. I would rather sit through a movie like White Chicks or Date Movie than ever see this abomination of film ever again. First and foremost the editing is TERRIBLE! scenes cut abruptly and with no cause. The extremely watered down plot is so loosely tied together it is hard to even follow what the actual story is. We virtually had a seizure in the opening sequence with all the flashing I'm messages and modern internet mumbo jumbo, it was so corny and lame! The preview to this movie makes it look SO much better than it really is, I would have been happier seeing the preview and never seeing the movie, then at least I would have had a fantasy of how wonderful it could be but no, I had to drag my most cynical friend with me to see it, now she thinks I am a complete idiot and will never let me pick the movie again. This was the biggest letdown of the summer 2006 movie season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice idea, poor execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pulse was a really great idea -- I loved the basic plot of computer ghosts hunting living users. Sadly, the idea wasn't developed much beyond that point.The characters were 2 dimensional: I found myself not really caring whether they lived, or wishing they would die quicker so the movie would end sooner.The lighting and set design were awful. The movie was BLUE! Using light filters to create a mood is one thing, but the actors alternately looked like corpses or like they were 45 feet under water. And the set design was just sick: someone needed to paint the walls with some KILLZ, cos the whole city looked like it had a serious mildew problem. Supposedly it was set at a university in Columbus, OH -- but it couldn't be OSU since Ohio State isn't that dirty. Perhaps it was Jacob's Ladder U? Whatever...but you can tell the students never visited campus before enrollment.And back to the plot. It had a lot of potential, but you never found out the ghosties' motivation. Sure, they wanted life, but how did they come to inhabit computers? How did they die? Are they affected by magnets or other sources of EM fields? What's with the red tape? "It blocks a wavelength, or something" we're told, but there's never any conclusions drawn.All in all, the film presents only questions, and no answers. But the biggest question I was left with was "why did I bother?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer makes this movie look very interesting and frightening but I was really let down. It's kinda hard to explain but every time the movie intended for me to be scared, I wasn't. I'm a wimp with scary movies so don't think I'm desensitized or anything like that. First of all the bad guys..things.. whatever they are, aren't scary or even creepy. You never really care about the good guys, partly because they are stupid enough to go investigate everywhere alone, and partly because the acting was uninspired.This is all a shame, since the concept was very interesting, but everything else was boring, lame, or just bad. Don't waste your money on this stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PULSE (2006) * Kristen Bell, Ian Somerhalder, Christina Milian, Rick Gonzalez, Jonathan Tucker, Samm Levine, Ron Rifkin, Kel O'Neill, Zach Grenier, Brad Dourif. Inept and harrowingly unscary tech horror flick ? based on a "J" horror Japanese thriller "Kairo" ? about a bunch of moronic college pals who discover that their friends are being killed off by ghostly apparitions that are using technology as their m.o.'s to a new order. Boring, terribly acted and awful in all regards; in fact the ONLY reason this film didn't get a ?* or realistically a 0 * was the delightfully out-of-nowhere cameo by Dourif as a crazily spouting believer in the end of the world that had me giddy. Trivia note: the Weinsteins kept this from being released due to a falling out with Wes Craven who gets a screenplay credit despite his attempt to direct the remake; go figure! Skip this altogether and pray there is no sequel! (Dir: Jim Sonzero)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in the bottom 10 horror films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>excluding independent bad stuff like Manos the Hand of Fate, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. the acting is flat and lacks conviction, the supernatural premise itself is impossible to summarize since the rules the filmmakers set for the supernatural phenomena seem to change from one minute to the next. The plot is completely incomprehensible since no explanation is given for any action undertaken by the characters. The only other studio film of a similar genre i can think of that was this incoherent was Underworld evolution. Again there are many films on mst3k that are awful but most of those were made outside the Hollywood system, this film had every chance to be original and the director failed spectacularly under the circumstances. One can only imagine why someone with no ideas or desire to tell an original story ends up being a director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was ambitious at best. The movie was slow and anyhting but frightening. The characters had a direction in the beginning but the movie failed to go anywhere with them. The actors did a fine job but the story was lacking in almost every aspect. There were several questions left unanswered. The plot was chalked full of gigantic holes and was boring to boot. I found it annoying that every environment in the picture was dirty and scummy. I swear these characters couldn't seem to find a clean place anywhere. If your looking for a scary flick this isn't your movie. If your looking to be entertained ,this isn't your movie and if your looking for a good movie guess what this isn't your movie. If you cant wait to see it at least wait for it to come out in the video store. The worst was probably the ending I wont spoil it for you but the movie ends badly. I expected more from Wes Craven who co wrote the screen play. This is just one guys opinion take it or leave it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well at least the female characters look good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So my friend Pat calls me up at work to see if I want to go see a movie with his brother Sean and him after I get off my shift. If I could do it over again I would not have picked up the phone. Instead, I might have actually stayed at work overnight. This is because I was asked to go see the new horror movie 'Pulse". I hated this movie with the fiery kind of hate that only burns in the souls of Stalin and that dude form Korea. The general idea of the movie is as follows: college kids release super computer virus that unleashes ghosts on unsuspecting wifi users. And then *SPOILER* everyone dies. I have to use the phrase "general idea' because I feel that the word "plot" just doesn't apply here. Put it this way, if I were to use the word "plot" then I would also have to say that this movie has plot holes that would lead to China. Now that that's out of the way, let's get into some of the characters. We have the white chick, the ethnic chick, the Latin guy, some other guy, and some dude that has all the makings of the next Ashton Kutcher, only minus the talent because this guy makes Ashton look like Jack Nicholson. This is all I need to say about the characters because they all act like the dead things that they are constantly trying to get away from. I know I said I would not go into the general idea again but I will anyway because there are still certain aspects of the general idea are so not worth talking about that they fall through one of those plot holes to China and come out on the other side worth talking about again. So, first off the virus is contracted when a black background with white lettering appears on the screen. The letters say, "Do you want to see a ghost?" Every character in the whole movie is shown clicking on the letters to indicate an answer of yes. Now, at what point am I to believe that every person that this happens to would want to see a ghost. I know that this may be a hard offer to pass up, but I would guess that at least one of these characters would say, "You know what? I think that this looks an awful lot like a virus so, no, I would not like to see a ghost. They're way too scary anyway." All right guys, that is all I can really say about the general idea, as the aspects of the general idea fell back into one of the plot holes and they ended up not worth talking about again. In the end, this movie ripped off so many other movies that I can't even count. These movies include: "Resident Evil" and "Fear.com." Think about that for a millisecond, they ripped off "Fear.com." Wow; I haven't even seen "Fear.com" but?wow. "Resident Evil" sucked too. Enough said. As Joel Siegel would say, "Someone call a crash cart because this "Pulse" doesn't have one."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love, death, comedy, tragedy, conflict, death, rebirth--the qualities that very well classify the building blocks of a wonderful movie that strikes the hearts of its viewers. This movie had none of these qualities, yet somehow it managed to satisfy the dearth in my pocket after burning $9.25 at the box office with its overabundance of sexy dead guys with huge eyes. The special effects in this movie pushed the limits of new age graphic design--static images of what I think were dead people that appeared as if they were copy and pasted in photoshop and animated in macromedia flash on the film. The dazzling effects did not overshadow the wonderful acting of this starstruck movie, including some of the greats such as that Spanish kid from Old School. I recommend this movie for people of all ages yet I do not believe you should go see this if you have an extreme phobia of the internet or air that wireless internet may travel through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attack of the PG-13 rating!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching Kurosawa's original "Kairo/Pulse" a few years ago. For the first 20 minutes or so, I was moderately engaged. AND THEN came the scene where, in the extreme foreground, the heroine/protagonist is snarfing around in her purse for something while far, far away in the background a tiny blip of an anonymous character calmly climbs an 8-story water tower, flings herself from it, and splats on the ground unceremoniously?no big clashing cymbals and violin strikes, no crazy epileptic-style editing. Just one clean, smooth, continuous, absolutely heartbreaking and breathtaking shot.At that moment, my "moderate engagement" became something else entirely. My jaw dropped open and I said aloud to the empty room: "Oh no, I did not just see that! That did not just happen! What the--?" From that moment, "Kairo/Pulse" became one of my top ten movies of all time.Sitting in the theater today watching Sonzero's remake of "Pulse," I guess I shouldn't be surprised that my jaw didn't drop open a single time. Like so many of us, when I heard the final rating on the remake was to get the kiss-of-death PG-13-rating, I thought I'd skip this remake entirely, and just stay in love with the original apocalyptic vision of Kurosawa. But I had a free few hours and was able to get into a matinée for cheap. Glad the ticket only cost me $5.Let's go back to that nonchalant, but heart stopping, image of the water-tower suicide for a second. It didn't exist in the Hollywood remake?not anywhere. I'm not arguing that a single scene makes a movie; but in Kurosawa's original, this was a breaking point in the narrative. This was the image that represented a world that clearly and irreversibly started sliding down the toilet. The image of this "anonymous, nonchalant suicide in the background" was his thesis, I think, on isolation, abandonment, loss. The remake seemed to have no such thesis, anywhere.When I got home, I (once again) saw the commercial for "Pulse" on the tube (it is in heavy rotation at the moment of course). And what did I see there? A .2-second clip of someone hurtling themselves off a water tower! There it was?in clipped, epileptic, trailer form?Kurosawa's thesis. Yet, that sequence does not exist in the movie, anywhere. What the hell?'Ah!' I thought to myself, 'Attack of the PG-13 rating once again.' I've got to stop going to these PG-13 rated "horror" movies.Before I close, allow me to mention two things, one good and one bad. The good thing is that the script/direction/etc. managed to somehow keep that overbearing ennui and restless sadness that Kurosawa's original film is bathed in. I was glad to see that this heavy sadness was still present in the movie?albeit in smaller and more easily-digested doses.And now to the bad thing: Where did this Kristen Bell person get her acting diploma exactly? Stinko.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, and I use the term loosely has been the worst 8.95 spent in the history of cinema. This was only the second movie that I had to leave in the middle of, and the prior needs no mention as to not take any spotlight away from this film abomination. Story stands out as perplexing and annoying along with loosely bound threads of weak plot that fail to tie the hopeless acting in any way. There was only about 10 seconds of interesting footage, specifically when Christina Milian was walking around looking all smoking and sexy. That's it. There is nothing scary or intelligent about this Kurosawa screenplay, or fascinating about Sonzero's directing second try. It's not Sonzero's fault. This ship has sunk even before leaving port.Do not go see this movie unless accompanied by a bucket of tomatoes to chuck at the screen. I literally left in the middle of the movie and have asked the remaining 20 or so people in the theater if they're kidding about watching the rest,- guess what, five more left along with me. A definite, PASS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I initially watched this movie because of Ian Somerhalder starring in it. I just downloaded it to have seen all his movies and was gladly surprised. The movie IS a successful remake unlike some others, and the cast was great. It wasn't really scary (or maybe I'm just used to scarier things), but it did keep me tense till the end. I have to congratulate the movie makers, especially the director, for the great solutions they have come up with. And it's really good that after all Bell was cast here instead of Dunst, she is much better of an actress and I liked THAT Mattie better next to Dexter. Speaking of, the reason I watched the Pulse was Ian Somerhalder, and I was very glad to see him out of his usual "Look how fun, smart, cool and hot character I am" pose. Hell, that man is good! Not many can so perfectly shift absolutely different personalities we see him play in Pulse, Tournament and Vampire Diaries, and be a completely different person in real life at the same time.

		<fullReview>The spirits of the dead discover a way to contact the living and enter into their world through electronic devices. Moreover, these decidedly nasty and dangerous spirits suck the lifeforce from the living. A select group of folks find out what's going on, but can they figure out a way to stop the angry and lethal spirits before it's too late? Director Jim Sonzero, working from an inspired and intriguing script by Wes Craven and Ray Wright, relates the absorbing premise at a steady pace, stages the shock set pieces with considerable flair and skill (a sequence in an underground apartment laundry room is especially harrowing), and does an expert job of creating and maintaining a potently spooky, paranoid and sinister atmosphere which becomes more increasingly eerie and unsettling as the plot unfolds towards a startlingly downbeat surprise apocalyptic conclusion. This film further benefits from solid acting by the sturdy cast: Kristen Bell is appealing as the perky and worried Mattie, Ian Somerhalder is likewise fine as shrewd computer boffin Dexter, Brad Dourif has a neat cameo as a raving doomsayer in a café, plus there are sound contributions from Christina Milian as the sassy Isabelle Fuentes, Rick Gonzalez as slick internet hustler Stone, Samm Levine as the easygoing Tim, and Kel O'Neil as the unhinged Douglas Ziegler. The ghosts are genuinely freaky and scary. The special effects are excellently done and quite convincing. Best of all, there's no obtrusive silly humor to detract from the grim severity of the bleak premise. The filmmakers warrant extra points for staying true to said bleak premise to the literal bitter end. Why, we even get a valid and provocative central point on how our over-reliance on technology could possibly reap the seeds of our eminent destruction. Mark Plummer's gloomy cinematography gives the picture an appropriately dreary look. Elia Cmiral's shivery and ominous score hits the shuddery spot. An unjustly maligned and underrated fright feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't Understand Why More People Don't Like This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This American horror film, shot in Romania, is one of the better movies of it's kind during the last several years. But I seem to be in a minority here as most viewers don't seem to share my opinion. The movie kept me interested all the way through and most of all, I thought it was scary. There's nothing worse than a horror film that doesn't scare you. {Anyone see "Boogeyman" lately?} I've heard the movie was hard to follow. Funny, I had no problem knowing what was going on. The special effects are very creepy. I'd rate this movie higher than "The Grudge" or even "The Ring," which are two other recent movies in this mold that were more popular but much harder to follow and not as scary. The overall look of the film is dark, bleak, and foreboding. But that may have more to do with being filmed in Romainia rather than the filmmakers overt attempt to make it appear that way. Either way, it adds to the creepiness of the movie. Give Pulse a try. It's so much better than what you've heard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give 5 for potential. Since the movie got its potential. The general idea of some "Invasion". I have not seen the Japan movie. Personally I do lot like this type of movies from Japan - scaring just for scaring. You saw one girl getting out from the well - you saw them all. So having not being watcher of Japan original I watched the movie with fresh mind and potential interest. I feel disappointed because of two things: 1. The authors were unable to make their minds as for "explanation" of what really happened. Getting from simple horror to the nice cheap S-F would get the movie a nice boost. I would even prefer to watch "alien invasion" on radio frequency waves that seeing ghosts that are so ugly. Some tend to believe ghosts are caring for their relatives. I tend to believe in it If I have to believe in ghosts :) 2. Proportions of accents. There are scenes in some movies that kill the atmosphere. So you do not feel scared anymore. You just sit and watch since you feel stopping watching would be like to admit that you lost your time on your demand. So there is a scene when the Aliens from Computers get at large and there is a TV message and the guy speaking that there are problems, difficult situation, crisis.... And all of the sudden...our main character...does nothing! She just watches...sits, takes off the jacket and does nothing. This moment was the end of serious watching. Just like a script writer told me "Hey we lost the pace and ideas so you know...help yourself..but we need to sell this movie anyway to someone. So nothing personal :)"Finally I am a bit surprised that action is located on some campus. We do not know what they study. They mental capabilities are rather low. They live like pigs eating fast food, sitting at computers, chatting, celling. Of course there were scenes we could understand the message - we are addict to hi tech of communication. But later on these young people we just calling themselves and turning computers on and off. The first one to get killed was really hard to believe to be capable to writing anything more than some simple code. I would feel safer seeing highly educated people getting with experiment that got awry. These young people would not be able to experiment with the microwave cooking. I cannot imagine them experiment with new technology - global one - while living like rats.So... the idea of invasion of such aliens would apply to me. Especially if we could fight back to repair what we have done.I hope the next movie would be more sophisticated. I tend to believe there must have been some issues with production. I cannot believe someone decided to produce something like this with no arguments.Again - very good idea - wasted to fissionable Japanese series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first off I love Asian horror, i love horror period ... but this movie I could tell by the trailers it was going to suck and big time. I watched it this weekend and the previews proved to me what I already new a sucky movie. I was praying maybe they previews didn't do it justice so I watched it anyway.**** Possible Spoilers for those who haven't seen this horrible film known to man******* It wasn't scary at all, it had horrible acting, horrible plot, and it just didn't catch my interest. It is a white noise wanna be, this movie made White Noise look like a 10 star movie and i HATED white noise. What was with the tape? they didn't explain why the red tape kept the ghosts out. Why couldn't it be any other tape? Why did the people turn to ash when they got infested by them? How did the main character's ex boyfriend and the hacker guy friend stumble on to the frequencies that let the dead escape into the real world, where did the frequencies come from? All this movie explained were a group of college friends who some how wind up with a dead friend whom they want to discover how he died. Then we get the new guy Dexter who had no point in this movie other than eye candy for the ladies and the main chick eye candy for the guys.So all in all this movie sucked. If you want to watch it go right ahead but your in for a disappointment and for those who like it sorry but it wasn't that great of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people live their lives around the computer; without having much human contact. Lives drained of real human contact. I like going out and wonder if the idea of the electronic world sapping ones soul of real living experiences inspires this movie. The preview is awful, but actually watching the film is a better experience. The concept and acting are great. The movie is comparable to an outerlimits episode. I love the doomsday style ending. I find the ending not to scary, for the electronics would die out after a while without proper up keep. The female actress Bell reminds me of that Buffy girl from the Grudge. I wonder if this movie was done in Japan first? Pulse reminds me of The Ring and The Grudge? 7 out of 10 Rent the DVD on cheap night like I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pulse is the latest horror film to grace South Africa's big screens. When a group of techno-geeks discover strange frequencies, they unwittingly unleash an evil presence into the human realm. This unstoppable computer virus assumes a life-force all of its own. Internet-servers crash; telecommunications networks shut down and total global chaos ensues. The electromagnetic apparitions appear as trapped energy forces inside the hard-drives of personal computers. However they soon morph through into the real world and wreak total mayhem. After what appears to be a few unrelated suicides, people start disappearing en masse. Luckily, two brave college kids have the guts to get to the bottom of it. These gruesome phantoms desire no less than the very essence of human life and there is precious little that can stop them.Wes Craven of Nightmare on Elm Street fame was co-opted to oversee the screenplay of Pulse. The film would have scored well, had it not been hamstrung by the clichéd concept of demons invading humanity from cyberspace. Sadly, this film rapidly disintegrates into a rather mundane affair. It fails to do the one thing essential to being rendered a success in the horror-genre ? captivating the audience's attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Sonzero directs a screenplay by Wes Craven and Ray Wright. Too much technical babble and a story line that I found just not very interesting. A computer hacker accidentally downloads a strange wireless signal that threatens to consume the world. It is a vicious signal that allows the dead to enter the world by use of electrical appliances, cell phones and computers. The gateway is wide open and the hacker, before committing suicide, tries to warn his college friends of what has been unleashed. Will this evil cause world wide suicide? The special effects are very good and some terrifying scenes are very disturbing. The cast includes: Kristen Bell, Christina Milian, Ian Somerhalder, Johathan Tucker, Octavia Spenser and Joseph Gatt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not awful not amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very hesitant about seeing this film due to all the awful reviews it received. However, I don't regret spending money on it at all. Simply put, the film does manage to deliver a narrowly passable plot, with OK acting into a film that does succeeds in entertaining you for its 90minute duration. Furthermore the film does succeed in scaring you for roughly 3/4 of its running time. Though when I say scared I don't mean terrified, rather, I mean your shocked and disturbed frequently and feel a dreaded suspense through large parts of its duration. The films method of scaring you is not particularly clever, an example would be: suspenseful music, disturbance coming from the fridge, character edges towards fridge, opens fridge, nothing there, turns to leave, AND suddenly large feral monkey/ human creature rendered in grayish black and white shoves its deformed face while making scream/ bark noise into the camera lens for a frame or two of the film all of this shot in a depressing Stalinist apartment block atmosphere. The film repeats this method frequently (perhaps to frequently) because after 3/4 of the film the audience is mostly desensitised and the only thing that keeps your interest is the termination of the plot. I should also not that the film attempts to scare you by showing depressing black and white images that are somewhat disturbing on various computer screens exactly like the Ring.Anyway my point is this: this is not a great horror film, its just entertaining, you are not bored, you do have some empathy with some of the characters, the plot is just passable and it is scary in a cheap kind of way. If there isn't much on and you see this film you won't leave the cinema feeling glad that its all over. Also I think many of the reviewers are to critical, you should not expect to see a masterpiece from what is essentially a teen movie nor is it absolutely dreadful, its simply an OK movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not For Kairo Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying, if you are a fan of the original Japanese film Kairo (2001), do not watch this with the expectations of a faithful reproduction. Being a huge fan of the original film I had great expectations of a descent 'Americanisation' a la The Grudge. My hopes were shattered just after the opening credits and it never got better.The acting is below par, the directing is questionable and the screenplay is toiletpaper at best. The intense psychological thrills of the original have been replaced with typical jack-in-the-box style scares that, frankly, were predictable and unsatisfying.Perhaps a redeeming element is some pretty nice visual effects, but thats not enough to bring this typical teen 'shocker' back to life.Its crap from the start to the end, Kiyoshi Kurosawa would be turning in his grave if he was dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to choose one particular aspect of this film without sounding like you're trying to put it down or bashing, but it's hard to find the opposite either. It just doesn't have much going for it, except a premise that it's not even that exciting.Once again, the rather strange approach taken by marketing in the film industry has put together an exercise in frustration, a film that doesn't have much life because there is no really conflict. The entire film keeps sinking along with all the hope of the protagonists. It seems as if the executives and creative powers that worked on this movie were subjected to the same fate than the "heroes" in "Pulse".The look of the film is interesting and appropriate to its mood, yet after a while one grows tired of its monotonous palette. The actors are competent and try to work their respective lines in some of the deadliest dialog ever to reach the screen. This film is a perfect example of what one someday will refer to as "the darkest ages of Cinema", a period characterized by either tasteless or unimaginative work that almost destroyed an industry.There is something very particular about the way films like "Pulse", which appear to have originated in some type of Japanese media. Either something disappears or is misunderstood in the translation, or there is something cultural that we can't relate to, some subtlety that doesn't work in American Horror cinema. It's a mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie not expecting too much, and that was exactly what i got. No one in the movie theater seemed frightened at any parts, and i believe i heard more laughs than screams. Which should be embarrassing to Wes Craven and the director, because the movie was trying to be serious, but only instilled laughter.It seemed at first the movie was trying to be like the Ring(Maybe The Ring 2, since that was just as bad as pulse), with all the camera angles. There was actually a part in the movie where a lady started walking towards the camera , exactly the same way the little girl does in the ring. But then the movie tried to switch gears midway, and it tried to become a movie like 28 days later. Except that movie was actually believable. In the pulse you had no feeling for the characters, and you could care less what happened to them which partly may have been because of the bad acting (who are these people?).Overall the movie was very disappointing,and really confusing. Nothing really made since, and didn't follow a certain pattern. The one thing that really annoyed me was the fact that people kept disappearing, but all the other characters did not seem to notice and just went on with there everyday life. It is too bad I didn't go see Talladega Nights instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to lie...this was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen...not just horror movies, all movies. The plot was terrible, the scenes were terrible, and the ending was the icing on the cake. I actually gave this movie a 2 only because the scenes were still just a little bit scary. After the first scene I knew that the movie was going to make no sense whatsoever. By the time the ending showed up I was saying to myself 'maybe the ending will make up for the plot.' But I was dead wrong. The movie ended with a sort of 'To Be Continued...' look, but there's no way they could dignify themselves to make a second movie. I hope that didn't spoil the movie for you, but if I were you, I'd wait about seven months before this movie premieres on HBO/Cinemax/Starz/etc. I honestly wish I could get my nine dollars back from the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In itself, Pulse (2006) wasn't THAT bad. The big problem is : the trailer showed all the impressive scenes of the movie.Think about that : The Ring (2002)was really good. Why ? No massive amount of trailers on TV, only some banners on the net. (Actually, this might be because I live in Montreal, Qc, Canada. Here, we had no cue on what that movie might be. Maybe there has been a lot of publicity in the US.) So the only way of knowing anything about it was to read a plot summary somewhere. That's what my sister and I did. We arrived at the cinema awaiting to see a horror B-movie. We've been astonished, you bet !Same thing for Saw (2004) : the trailers didn't show much. Same thing as Thir13en Ghosts (2001).Why did The Grudge (2004) or Pulse (2006) didn't work that much ? The answer is simple : too much meat in the trailers. Don't give away everything on TV, please ! Keep some surprise ! IF YOU'RE UNABLE TO MAKE A TRAILER FOR YOUR MOVIE THAT DOES NOT GIVE AWAY ALL THE SURPRISING MOMENTS OF YOUR MOVIE, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO STORY TO TELL ABOUT ! YOUR PLOT IS AWFUL ! SO DON'T DO IT !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another movie where I simply regret of going. Another product of failing Hollywood that horribly mix computer with ghost (similar to White noise, Stay alive, etc). The idea is perhaps not as original but still appreciable if the movie could be done with some real and articulate more detail on the plot - but unfortunately, it isn't. To some extent what makes this film watchable is its cinematography. Every angle of each scene is beautifully shot, and the CGI was absolutely astonishing. However this is not be accompanied by 'watchable plot'. There is too much focus on ghost and computer itself while not showing us the character development or uniqueness (the acting is bad by the way)- it ends up where everybody has gotten either dead or suddenly gone after some ghosts appear. As I mention before, the plot does not make any slightest sense and for me is incredibly disappointing. All in all, the great cinematography dominates the movie but with no real plot - it unfortunately can't save the movie.Its simply annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake ruined by director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I laughed out loud several times during this movie. It was just poorly timed in the action sequences and the plot crescendo. To me, it was clear most of the problems of the film were largely due to the director. Several horror genre rules: Never reveal the creature in the first 5 minutes. Once you've seen it over and over, it becomes numbingly unscary by the 120th minute. When you have an actress with a great fan base like Kristen bell, don't ruin it for everyone by doing a bathtub scene that is totally unappealing. What lies beneath was totally better. Please watch this movie to see how it's done. Yes the script was bad, but you can do another take if the actor's delivery seems particularly insincere. If you have good character actors, use them. I could count at least 3 people whom I have seen in many other things and they ALWAYS do a good job. If they were given more meat, the movie could have been better. Because let's face it, the teeny boppers have the looks, but not the range. There were SO MANY continuity problems I could scream. I counted about 10 or 15. The movies just seemed hacked together which is probably why the flow of the storyline was so jarring. I LOVED the look and it was clearly a remake of a recent Japanese horror flick based on the rather odd plot and theme of "emptiness".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, like all, had good points and (several) bad points. Overall, this was a pretty bad movie. The less than impressive acting was one thing, but it relied on noises and flashing images to make the viewers jump, rather than actually being scary. The only part of the movie I actually found to be scary were the web cam sequences. Other than that, after a few appearances of..well whatever they were, it's never really explained...the shock wore off and the scenes just seemed drawn out. Along with the ghosts, demons, virus or whatever you wish to call it, something else that was left unexplained was the use of the red tape. The best explanation we got was "it works...I don't know why." The whole movie just seemed to not make sense and left too many holes. It's very common for movies to be plot-less but gory just because it can be, but this movie doesn't even do that. The death scenes make the victims seem like vampires when they explode into dust, and leading up to that point is not even satisfying, it just looks like they had an accident with black paint. The only thing that saved this movie was how hot "Dexter" was. I think it was a good concept for a movie, but in the end, not something that should gave made it to filming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers within.I thought that the first half of Pulse had some genuine creepy, scary moments. In the first 45 minutes, I was already planning to sleep that night with the lights on and probably not even turn on my computer or TV set. I found it to be THAT creepy.Then, in the second half, the momentum dropped. The creepy atmosphere, the unknown supernatural presence all dissolved away into a ho-hum science fiction movie.I had 3 MAJOR problems with the movie:1) These spirit beings have been able to grab *anyone* that they want at *anytime*. The WHOLE planet is in a crisis because people are being converted and absorbed\killed by the spooky spirit things that live in the electronics. For some reason the 2 main characters are able to waltz around spirit city and the spooks CANT get them. Come on!!! People are dropping left and right because there is no defense (other than red tape), yet the 2 characters walk into the HEART of where all this began and walk right back out again??!!! Yes, the spooks "seem" to be following them the whole time but are *unable* to get them. Whatever!2) Therewere plot holes galore mainly because of the inconsistencies of the spirit-creatures. They can appear anywhere, even in normal mirrors, yet they are driven off by a cellphone that cant get a signal, because they need cellphone signals .. . .? What...? There was just TOO much inconsistencies in how the spooks could appear and what their limits were, etc.3) Okay, after you see the same, creepy white skinned guy 50 times, he stops losing his spookiness :POverall, I thought that the first half was great, then it just went downhill. I rate this movie 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

I think it was suspenseful, but the entirety of it was just sort of strange. A character comes in to the story in the middle of the movie, and suddenly starts to be with the "in" group, or whatever. Wha--?! I did like the idea of that the ghosts steal your will to live, but the way that most of them died (turn to ash), it was just stupid!! The first death, that's what I would have assumed all of them would do; kill themselves. And Stone, he kept screaming "I don't want to die!!", so obviously he wasn't affected by the ghosts, but he had the mark and he turned to ash. But he had a will to live. This movie kept contradicting itself! In the previews, it seemed that the ghosts were coming out of the computers (and/or living in the computers) like in "The Ring". But they came wherever there was electronic use. And Dexter said that the people he was watching on his computer were actually watching him. Why? Because they were looking at the web cam? I don't understand why he would think that...I also don't understand the "dead zones". I think it meant that wherever there wasn't any electronic use, the ghosts couldn't be. SO WHY NOT STAY THERE?! This movie did want me to stay away from computers, TVs, cellphones, etc., especially since they didn't end it! But, it was so ridiculous, that I said "Forget it! I'm writing a review about it!!"

		<fullReview>here we go again, the dead coming through, but this time it's not the TV screen or the radio, like white noise, this time it's cell phones, satellites, and the computer most of all. i thought the script wasn't to bad actually. i loved the car crash that was awesome, especially with my new surround sound hooked up, my butt vibrated off the couch. i loved the plane crash that was awesome also. i liked the premise of the movie where there is a hole somewhere and we left it open and the dead are watching us constantly, jealous of what we have that they want and that is life. i also liked the special features on the disc they were better than average. the dead had some very good makeup, i like the parts where the dead sucks the soul out of the living characters. and the part where there is all of these hands grabbing at the lead character, and when the camera pans back , it takes the shape of a face. all in all i liked the movie, it wasn't perfect, but it takes a lot to please me horror wise. but i would watch it again definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well i bought this on DVD, and really enjoyed it, if ur going into it, thinking its a horror, u wont enjoy it its more of a sc-fi type film, and i don't know why people are giving it such bad reviews, i really enjoyed it and have seen a lot worse films such as reign of fire and that was a hit. Christina millan was my fav she stole the scene every time she was in it,a very good actor and hope to see her in more. Kirsten bell, who i love from Veronica mars is really good in it and it sort of has a dark atmosphere to it and i would kill myself if i lived there, everything is grey and so morbid lol. so overall i would give it a 7 as it was a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you kidding me?! This movie sucks!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been to IMDb before but NEVER posted, just read reviews and ratings of the movies. I did feel like posting a review on some movies but I didn't like doing the whole "creating an account" thing. Well, after seeing PULSE I just HAD to tell everybody how AWFUL this movie is!!! Words can not describe the desperation I went through while watching this movie. The first couple of minutes made me want to turn off the T.V., but I felt obligated to watch it, after all I did pay money to rent the stupid movie. But I just couldn't. My frustration turned into a mellow calmness and I ended up going to sleep. I didn't finish watching the whole movie; I returned the movie the VERY next day.THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER!! STAY AWAY! Spend your money on renting another movie, or save if for gas money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend and I were so excited for this to come out on DVD since we missed it in the theaters so this weekend I bought it. We have seen MANY horror/thriller movies and this was literally one of the worst we've seen. Especially considering the decent cast they had! It started out as a somewhat scary (albeit carbon copy of movies like "The Ring" and "The Grudge" in the way it was filmed) and got progressively worse. It tried to be too many things; by the end it actually took on a 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead theme that was laughable. I am so bummed that I spent 20 bucks on this movie. I mean, See No Evil and Stay Alive were even better and that's not saying much! Don't do it. Pick up the phone and call someone that can help you through your cravings for over-budget cheesy horror movies; you are not alone...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film was naff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film after my husband told me it had received 'rave' reviews. Well I don't know where he found those from because this film was a pile of doggy doo doo. I admit, it made me jump, but the storyline was rubbish. Nothing was explained; ie the red tape and suchlike.Throughout I was constantly looking at the clock waiting for it to end. If it was supposed to be the dead looking for life then why were they still ghosts when they sucked peoples will to live out? And if they were coming through the internet why wasn't that the first thing shut down? There are much better ways to spend an evening. This is definitely a "wait for it to be on TV" movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silly concept, but interesting execution. A lot of eye-candy and few "jump" scenes make up the bulk of it. If you want to go into a movie that is "visually" compelling while leaving your brain at the entrance, this is a decent, even so far as to say interesting shocker. The cast are attractive, yet not very well known actors. The filming quality is stylish, with some pretty effects- some used before, others unique to this film. However, the entire plot concept relies solely on the viewer's gullibility, and that's where I think Pulse made it's biggest mistake. The plot is just a little ham-fisted and is hard to swallow for anyone who isn't completely open-minded. Not to mention that a few completely pointless scares creates what begins as a shallow film.Acting in some places is a bit cheesy but in scenes that rely on realism to come through, i believe that it does. The cast achieves just enough balance to even out the good acting and the bad and there is one stand out performance that actually unnerved me. No it wasn't Christina Millian. She wasn't that bad.Pulse is definitely a movie which is pushed along by it's effects and while not ground breaking, the style comes across as interesting. One thing i did like is how they tied the title of the movie to the film. A bit subtle, but catchable. If you're into horror that tries harder to immerse you via mood and visual direction rather the putting together a believable plot, then Pulse is right up your alley. For any real critics, expect to tear it apart from the ground up, but for those of us in the middle, it averages to decent depending on whether we want to suspend our dis-beliefs, oh and COMPLETELY forget that we ever watched, "The Ring".5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie without any meaning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid film watcher, especially noting on the horror genre, I expect all horror movies to at least impose some sort of originality throughout the film, this however was not the case in the American remake "Pulse".The film constantly reminded me of other horror films made within the last decade or so. To name a few, The Shining, 28 Days Later, Constantine and The Ring were all obviously ripped off.It's hard to think that there was actually a budget on this movie. It leaves no suspense or room to think, practically serving it on a platter with "this is what's happening" lines, as if the audience couldn't figure out something so obvious.The sad thing is, the movie actually had potential, but the whole premise of ghosts contracting through virus's is absolutely ridiculous, to me, the message was simply this: Don't hack, and don't take your gadget and internet for granted or else some hi-fi, hacker electronic ghosts will take over your city.Now, if everyone owned a MAC then there wouldn't be any ghost revealing virus's in the first place. Yeesh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was dull and boring and as bad as the original Japanese version. when I went to see it, there was at most a small handful of people in the theater seats and this was on a Friday night! The plot and storyline for this movie is so far fetched and stretches so far that your eyes glaze over, your mind goes numb and you slump in your seat from sheer boredom. This movie looked like a hacker computer movie, a bad Japanese horror movie remake and a end of the world movie all mixed in one, throw in bad actors, dark muted colors and an occasional quick jump scare and you got this mess.Save your time and money and do something worthwhile and fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kairo shouldn't have an American counter part. The original was horrible and the remake is just as horrible. There is a lot of stuff (not to mention the entire plot line) that is new, but that doesn't make up for lack of of originality. It's not scary, it's not even amusing. It's good for background noise and that's about it. I do not recommend watching this movie until you have seen the original, and can compare the awfulness, but be warned- the original will bore you to death. It has the same plot is Ju-on and everything other Japanese horror movie ever made. The American counter parts to these movies though intended to be scarier, fall about 100 yards from being remotely scary. This movie is no exception and in fact, this movie is the worst.</fullReview>

I was watching with friends and one of them was calling for the stoppage of it, but I kept trying to defend it, saying that it might make sense and come together at the end, like a lot of movies I have seen, but of course I made them continue to sit through this garbage until the end. Whatever happened to good old horror movies? I would love for anyone who liked the movie to explain what I am missing. It just doesn't seem possible to be liked by any intelligent person. Venting about it sure was a waste of time but I do feel a little better, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In few words, George Romero meets Fear dot Com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this movie has cool effect. This movie have cool sounds. But if you see this movie with a little volume is not that scary. I think this movie has the look of the George Romero's zombies with a Fear dot com and Silent Hills mix (so is not that original). The acting is one of the lowest that I ever seen (typical of Dimension Films). Dimension film has this perfect models world that to me is a fantasy in a real world (the protagonist is a model, all his friend are pretty or Old navy fashion style). This movie is fine to have a good time, but if you want to be very scare to jump in the chair, I don't recommend Pulse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>white noise flashbacks--only worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not much of a movie buff, but even I couldn't keep from laughing through this one. The "special effects" with the monsters from....dun dah nuh nuh...the internet...sucked. Also, the fact that it was affecting the whole world was just kind of unbelievable and stupid. I saw White Noise and thought it was OK, and, to me, all Pulse adds up to is a White Noise flashback-only worse! At least the only thing stupid about White Noise was the ending! However, to be fair, I didn't start hating it until about the second half. The beginning is pretty interesting and you think you are about to watch a pretty cool movie, but then it just becomes dumb and predictable. I'm very jumpy (I couldn't sleep for two nights after watching The Hills Have Eyes), but even I just laughed at the "scary" parts. Oh well, at least it is rated PG-13, so if you are 14 and you want some cuddle time away from mom and dad, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I need to check my PULSE (come on it's not that bad of a remake)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie today. I was somewhat excited to see this film. After all I am always enthusiastic to see a remake of a film. I came into the movie, reading a lot of reviews from other IMDb by-passers and taking in to consideration all the comments. I did see Kairo way before I knew they were making a remake of the movie too. In comparison to the original I thought the story was well thought. To my surprise it more so stuck to the original story than what I expected, with a few minor add-ins here and there. (More Americanized if you know what I mean) I am disappointed about the "ballerina sequence", taken from the original, in the movie it was cut vary short and did not give it justice. Over all, the movie was good, but I have to say that us, Americans always want to Digitalize everything, which isn't always bad but it takes away from what the original brought to the screen. I don't want to give any of the plot away, but if you have seen Kairo then you kind of know what to expect. As for the acting, it was good enough for me, and wasn't to cheesy. I thought everyone played their roles well. Also, the story makes you think about how a lot of advancements in our society can sometimes over power what really matters in life. As for the ending, I WON'T SPOIL IT! (BUT IF YOU SEEN KAIRO, I DON'T THINK YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED) -technology seems to run our lives-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pulse is possibly the worst film I've seen in a theater the past ten years. Trying to be a techno ghost story for the internet age, it fails miserably. The story involving the release of vicious extra-dimensional creatures through a bandwidth experiment makes no sense. The creatures mainly attack to make the victims depressed. Check out the film for more info on this. Finally, it just doesn't work when this intimate horror story suddenly tries to become a worldwide event without half the necessary budget to pull it off. The final sequence appears to be a last minute addition to spice up a rather dull finale. The director apparently thought it was "cool" to film with a depressing and ugly blue palate for no reason I can figure out. The sets are filled with rotting food and decaying flesh. This has nothing much to do with the story, but must be to set the "mood" he wanted. Poor Kristen Bell better stay with her TV series. She shows precious little big screen charisma. The rest of the cast are either slumming or have reached the pinnacle of their careers with this film. It's not often you find a total failure, but sadly this s it.</fullReview>

A complete and utter waste of time and money. The plot was good and made a lot of sense except some of the schematics with some of the characters left you a little confused. I think that it needed a lot more work and effort then what was given. You don't get really any answers to this movie as to the relevance with a lot of things that happened in the movie in the first place. Overall not a good movie to go and see if you think if looks good i thought that till i watched the movie. Hopefully this will help you guys out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk about a blah experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see why Weinstein canceled this. I would disagree with the being too similar to the Ring as the real reason though. The real reason it should've never been made is because the premise is blah, the writing is horrendous and the set design is boring. Note to filmmakers here...Putting a blueish tint does not make for an artistic vision as when what is being filmed doesn't flow and entertain, you have garbage but in this case, darker garbage. The actors in this have some talent but all they did was scream a little bit. Combine that with the bland dialog in the boring setup makes the director the primary problem here. I could pick out a number of local high school filmmakers and they could put together a more coherent vision of their own and be much more interesting. To begin, it is similar to the Ring in some aspects like the communication though electronic equipment and also a lot like White Noise. There is nothing wrong with taking homage with other frightfests but to pretty much tweak a few things and make it your vision is a flawed concept. There is a number of quick-cutting horror films that get thrown out every week on video and this should be right there with it. The idea of them trimming it to get a PG-13 shows where the studio sits with this waste of time. They will try to get as much money as possible out of 1 week and it will be on video around Halloween or so. Save your time and money and go see the Descent or better yet, rent the original Japanese version as it is better than this waste of time. Weinstein probably saw the garbage that this was to become and passed to make something/anything else. I give it 2 as a couple of the actors in this have talent here but on just about every other level, it gets the lowest possible score.</fullReview>

Any "horror" part is shown in the trailers and previews, and really, if you watched those...you saw this movie already. The end..well..see for yourselves...but, leaves much to be desired, and some more of an explanation would have been nice, but, if you can see it cheap...well...still don't, f*ck this movie, and f*ck its crappy acting and "almost attempt" at scares, see something else for 8 bucks.</fullReview>

The movie was highly predictable and like all modern films the movie ends with a failure ends and hope fails because the movie producers believe their so genius by changing what used to be considered the normal ending where good prevails to having good fail. Ontop of this the acting was horrible and as in all horror movies the people had a IQ of a banana. The person who makes the first horror film with people that have intelligence will be the richest man in the world. The movie was also incredibly short and the producers had rushed everything and had used all the good scenes in the previews which seems to be a repeated habit recently from Hollywood. The movie needed more useful scenes facing the fact that about 50 percent of the movie could of been cut out and also could of had a better explanation and the opening scene of been when the ghosts first came through. Overall terrible movie!</fullReview>

I SWORE at the end you'd see a post logo somewhere. Kristen: Well we've learned a lot today Ian: We sure have. Kristen: But If there's one thing I've learned, its to always use your local post office. Ian: the post office, for ALL your communication needs. *cheese smiles*Or what about this:Matty: What do they want. Izzy: What they don't have. They want life.OK, so....after the ghosts kill everyone in the world..they just do...what exactly. Live? cause...I dunno doesn't look like there's any real PURPOSE to taking everyones life...they just do.Uberghost: I've done it! I've taken EVERYONES life force...*sigh* ...now what?I just REALLY don't understand the point. I mean, you take someones life so you can...live again... ? and then after that what? they kill YOU?? So THEY can live again... and then it's just some giant circle of sucking???And What happens to Tim?Tim: I just wanted to see you again.Matty: thats...thats great...um...point to this?And at the end? I swear it was a spoof of million dollar manMatty: *driving into the sunrise* We will rebuild it..make it better, faster, stronger...They're just supposed to build colonies in rural areas with no wi-fi? Until what? How do you get food? How do you GO get food?? You're pretty much trapped in clumps of farm land until you go try and get survivors then the UberGhost just goes:"Haha!! life force sucking....haha....why again?"Like people were laughing at so many things I just figured I didn't get the joke. It's just too bad that this was Kristen Bells movie debut, she' be praised and criticized for sure!awesome. It was so bad, it was awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited to see this movie, but I ended up being supremely disappointed. The basic (but not really, this is one of the worst and most convoluted plots I've ever seen) story is that a group of friends stumbles onto a virus-like infection in wireless gadgets that is causing the deaths of them and millions around the country. Kristen Bell as Mattie, along with Ian Somerhalder as Dexter (who form a very, very fast and almost not believable friendship) scramble to beat the virus before it kills them. The acting was pretty sub par at best. Kristen Bell's character is introduced and seems like a lively, fun-loving girl. She quickly turns into an angry, angsty, and bitter character. Granted, the events that precede this sudden change would make anyone do an about-face, but it just didn't seem like she had any of that to begin with. In the beginning there seems to be a tight-knit group of four friends, two guys and two girls. The guys are barely given any screen time, it is only Mattie and Christina Milian as Izzy who matter. The plot twists and turns and never really stops to explain anything that is going on. There are maybe two jump moments in the entire film, but that's it. The creatures coming from the electronics look like demons of some sort, but it is never explained who or what they are and what happens to their victims. The first moment that is supposed to be scary takes so long to build up that you know exactly what is coming so when the clichéd thing-jumping-out-loudly-out-of-nowhere happens, you aren't even scared. All in all, this is a skip.</fullReview>
