		<shortDescription>The creepiest horror movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry for the hyperbole topic but I mean it. I am a horror movie fanatic and I have become desensitized to cheap scares with loud noises and murderers running around with axes. I am very picky and only like one out of every few dozen horror movies I watch. I also don't like nonsensical supernatural horror that uses creepy images as a gimmick without actually bothering to make any sense. So when I say that this is the creepiest horror movie ever made, it is not hyperbole.That said, this movie will bore or confound the average horror movie watcher. It is not linear or logical and it doesn't explain everything that is going on, but it doesn't have to.This is an apocalyptic horror movie about loneliness and how people may become distant islands and ghosts even through connecting technology like cellphones and the internet. I don't know how anyone can make a horror movie about loneliness and make it creepy as hell but Kiyoshi Kurosawa pulled it off.That's all you need to know. Experience it with the lights off, no breaks, noise or distractions, or I will lock you in a room with a depressed ghost and tape the door shut with red tape until you become so lonely you will evaporate into nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why isn't this available in the US?I don't know how to describe this with out making it sound like something its not, but I have to say that this is one of the creepiest and most disturbing films I've seen in quite some time. Its not perfect, even if I gave it a 10 out of 10, simply because few films have left me that uneasy.Operating well with a sense that I can only describe as dream logic this concerns the really weird events surrounding several people who notice something is wrong when a friend goes missing. The friend is not the trigger, but the event that they notice making them suspect that all is not right in their world.Everything about how this story is calculated to send slowly building shivers up and down your spine. There are no real moments of shock, just ever growing horror and unease. I hated the way that this movie made me feel but couldn't stop watching.If there are any flaws is that the film is a bit long at just under two hours. The pacing wears and the logic, while frightening gets stretched almost to the breaking point.If you can stand slow calculating horror films that freak you out with images and implications then see this movie. Its one of the best I've seen in a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiyoshi Kurosawa's "Kairo" has to be one of the most mesmerizing supernatural horror films I have ever seen.The film is loaded with extremely dark and brooding atmosphere and some scenes actually scared me.The photography by Junichiro Hayashi is truly beautiful and the score is very haunting.The theme of "Kairo" is that at the end of the line there isn't anything except a fearful nothingness-no heaven or hell,just a miserable eternity of living in between states.The film is cold and bleak,even nihilistic in its portrayal of total isolation."Kairo" is pretty slow-moving and there is absolutely no gore,so fans of "Scream" or similar crap will be disappointed.Still the visuals are amazing:dark skies,deserted streets and crawling shadows will leave you stunned.A must-see for fans of Japanese horror.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Creepy and Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film works on many levels. What's odd is that one place it is weak in is the plot - it does somewhat tie it all up and make sense but my main point is it doesnt really matter - the director set out to make a scary ghost story and that it is! I see horror films from all over the world so I am pretty jaded when it comes to something "scaring" me but this film has many sequences that truly are frightening and disturbing. Some of the images have stayed with me for weeks. The lighting, the art direction and the use of muted colors (aside from reds used effectively)all make up for a creepy, eerie visual. I have to laugh at the arrogance of some of the comments on this and other "horror" films that claim since it didnt scare them the film is NOT SCARY. That is b.s. What scares one person may not scare another. You can say the piece didn't scare you but to make such a sweeping statement is vain. I personally didn't like any of the Friday of 13th movies, but obviously those films work on some level for millions of people. This film is so non-American in it's pace and core that that is what might turn off some viewers, but that's what I loved about it. The director just sets up the camera and keeps it on a space and then has things slowly emerge from the sides - he has you start to look and scope and wonder if you are REALLY seeing something as opposed to the lazy, bloated SHOCK moment of most US horror films. There are moments when people are confronted by visions/images of ghosts that move and terrorize just like real dreams - slow movements, awkward movements as the ghost approaches you. Terrifying. The film definitely doesn't know how to wrap it all up but in many ways, I found this film even scarier than the original RING. Well made ghost story. Seek it out, fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably my favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very touching. In fact, almost painfully so. I would recommend it to anyone in the mood to engage in a thought-provoking narrative about the human condition.I have to admit that when I first saw this film I did not expect it to be what it is. The basic premise involves a haunted website, so when I sat down to view it I was expecting something at the same level of terrible as fear.com; instead, I was shocked to find a truly provocative story full of surrealism and drama that examines the concept of isolation and the deep fear that all people have of loneliness.This, of course, means that the fear that Kairo invokes is not typical of the horror movie genre--at least not the North American horror movie genre; I can't speak for the Japanese--because it isn't really scary. It's disturbing and eerie, and frankly I wouldn't watch it alone in the dark, but I'll admit that I'm a bit of a coward (The Grudge still terrifies me, so make of that what you will). If you go into this movie wanting to see people being hacked apart, or if you want to be jumping out of your seat every few minutes by fake-out scares, you will probably be pretty angry by the time this one's over. Seriously--you'll probably be more freaked out by the original version of Dark Water, and that's saying something.However, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. This film provides a very moving portrayal of people's inability to truly connect with one another. It offers a bleak examination of human nature without being heavy-handed or pretentious; it doesn't come off as condescending and the creators obviously aren't trying to be snobbish or "intellectual". It simply asks the question: can we ever truly connect with one another, or are we doomed to be alone by our very natures?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm an old horror buff. I've seen some of the more notorious stuff around (Salo, Cannibal Holocaust, Caligula,...), but they all more or less about visceral horror.Which doesn't work if you helped slaughter a few pigs.What does work? Psychological horror. Impending doom you cannot prevent. Things you can't see or understand, but that are there right in front of your face. Music that shouldn't be scary, but which lingers anyway.It's a typical, slow moving J-Horror with an atypical idea behind it. That oblivion is actually preferable than immortality. Gore doesn't scare me - but some ideas do. Like i said - it made me squirm... One of the best horror movies ever made - for the patient ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>truly frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>a horror film hasn't given me chills in a while. this film made me feel as isolated and terrified as the characters in the movie. I had seen the American re-make before this film, and i'm kind of glad I did, because I got to save the best for last. If you were disappointed by the American Pulse, this predecessor will certainly make up for that sorry excuse for a horror.I can say without a doubt this is one of my top films to watch alone in a dark room if I wanted to scare the hell out of myself. And that just puts a big grin on my face. Not to mention, the lighting and cinematography in this film is also really well done, and adds a lot to the completely creepy mood throughout. While the story may be hard to follow if you don't know the history behind the film beforehand, it's scary either way. I've watched it twice now, and it's just as good the second time around. Even though this film is considered an older J-horror film, it's still fresh in my book.I think horror film makers that rely on cheap thrills and gore should take Kairo for a spin, they'd learn a lot from it. Kairo is a truly haunting, scary film that will leave your eyes wide open in terror. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More depressing than scary, and not worth 2 hours...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fully anticipate some hate in my direction, as some people have really taken to this film, but I have to say that it has just never done anything for me. I first watched it a couple of years ago and I had to force myself to finish it, for the sake of finishing it, but I was overwhelmingly bored. I returned to it again this afternoon (with a little bit of an older head on my shoulders :)) and I feel I can sort of offer a little more than 'boredom' as a comment.I think you have to start off be coming to this film with the right preconceptions, or at least not the wrong ones. It doesn't fit the same 'type' of J-Film as the Grudge or Ring, there are deaths but it's not some vengeful she-ghost hunting you for eternity, this film tries to utilise a different sort of 'horror', on a more emotional or psychological level by focusing on very everyday human fears such as death, the afterlife, and loneliness.It's interesting to see how (although much of the technology in the film is now very dated) some of the comments on it - such as those about how the internet doesn't really connect people - are still quite valid. But one of the problems I came to realise that I had with the film is that its message of an isolated world, with people ultimately being unable to face existing alone any more, felt too forced. It was alluded to or actually stated by the characters quite repeatedly, it was unmistakable what they were trying to 'say', and the more they said it the more depressed I felt.I wasn't scared by the thought, I wasn't horrified or disturbed I just felt a bit blue. Watching the world become less and less populated just felt a little too unbelievable, I felt I was watching a film taking place in some kind of parallel Earth, I felt distanced from it and that distance just sort of numbed the impact.One of the things I did like were the two separate stories playing alongside each other, and the meeting up, but I felt that the male student's story was far more engaging than the co-workers, they never seemed to progress in the story, they just kept dropping out one by one until the requisite one was left behind.I also have to agree that some of the film is beautifully shot, but to balance it there are also lots of grey scenes (some of which are quite hard to see), intended I think to add to the isolated, cold, world, but it's not really enough to break up the film or to keep it visually exciting. You can only sit and watch people having conversations, or wandering around unhappily, for so long. The use of music is very good, actually lifting up some scenes and making them quite memorable (I'm thinking of the jumping woman, for those who have seen it). But there seem to be quite long periods without it, or where it isn't used to contribute at all.I'm not saying that this is a horrible film, but I'm trying to balance out that it won't suit some people. Rent it first if possible, this isn't the kind of J-Horror film (can we call it horror?) that all films seem to be marketed as at the moment, it really might work for you, but it just didn't have the effect on me that it seems to have done on others here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique Japanese horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kario (Pulse) is unlike any Japanese horror I have seen. As much as I love the Ju-On series, the scares come from creepy ghosts that pop-up from unseen places. They are good movies, but those scares wear off after awhile. However, in Kairo the ghosts don't pop up suddenly and they aren't accompanied by loud music. They are just there and boy are they creepy. Sometimes they do nothing, they just stand there, staring. It creates a feeling of unease and constantly keeps the viewer on edge.It's not just the ghosts that are unique, the story is incredibly interesting and intelligent. But it is not linear, logical and it doesn't explain everything (it doesn't have to, though). It really leaves it up to us what to decide. This is what is so good about this movie, it's much unlike most horror films. Forget all the recent American horror films, although some are excellent they really aren't like this. This film is almost like a dream in some ways. It goes at a very slow pace (clocking in just under 2 hours) and there aren't a lot of scares. At times the story may seem illogical but I beg to differ.Kairo is really an apocalyptic horror much like the 2002 British horror film 28 Days Later (just replace zombies with ghosts). Also like 28 Days Later, this film carries a very profound social message but unlike 28 Days Later this one is about loneliness and how people become distant through the use of technology. There's also a heavy emphasis on the evils of suicide.Kiyoshi Kurosawa has created an intelligent, unique horror film that doesn't quite get the attention it deserves. If your willing to experience movie that will leave your unsettled and weired out afterwards, look no further than Kairo.4?/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch before bed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing this review because I'm too scared to walk to my room and get in bed.This movie is terrifying. It's slow, but keeps you completely engaged the entire time. The plot is confusing, but adds to its appeal. It's open to interpretation, which I like in a movie. I don't want everything laid out. Where's the mystery in that? You don't realize what's happening until it creeps up on you very, very gradually. You think you have the movie pinned, then you start questioning what's going on. Everything feels wrong, out of place, and extremely dreadful throughout. You won't like how you feel, but you'll want to see it through anyway.If you like plot-driven movies where there's a place for everything and everything in its place, so to speak, this one's not for you. This movie's focus is atmosphere and pure psychological terror, not logic.There's definitely some social commentary in this one. It's a thoughtful film and for being low-budget, the special effects are well-done. You'll be thinking about what this movie means to you.I really want to warn everyone who is considering watching this- it will haunt you. The ghost images are NOT your everyday American shock-fest. They will burrow into your psyche and live there, probably for a long time. And they are not pleasant.I honestly almost wish I hadn't seen this movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary, not coherent, but not completely bad (or good either)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend let me borrow this. With my friend being a major film buff and having a refined taste in films, I was expecting something really good here. And me being a graduate from film school (still making short films and Japanese horror films no less) I've come to realize that the Japanese horror genre is something truly gritty, dark and frightening. Films like Ring, Ju-on and Audition are completely terrifying pieces of horror. This film however is not a part of that category.While billed as a horror film, it really doesn't feel like horror. There really is no tension built up because the pacing is very dream like. Also in all horror films there is a clear "evil" plaguing the main characters. But throughout this movie I was left wondering "what the ?#($ is going on? Are these ghosts? Whats the motivation?" Even after the "explanation." In this movie, the explanation is trying to be logical, but if you think about it, the logic of it is completely ludicrous. And more importantly it doesn't explain anything. It doesn't give connections to why this is happening with the computers and why these "red tape" rooms are being created. Now I don't know if this lack of coherency is a result of a bad translation of the subtitles (but I can speak Japanese and could understand some of the original as well). It feels like certain things were "left out." For example, in the tag-line used for the movie on this site, it talks about a web-cam that is used. There is never once a mention of a web-cam in the movie, nor did I see one.And that is the second problem. This film is so gritty and so dark that its really difficult to see things properly. (that's my one complaint about Japanese films, they are all so poorly lit) I grew more frustrated than intrigued because things were not clear enough the make out.And lastly the characters and situations are not really plausible. The world this story takes place is overly contrived. Everyone is lonely and has no friends. I mean, not one friend. That's not normal, even for someone who is lonely. The way everyone reacts also isn't very believable. It feels like the film maker had something to say, but in doing so created a place and characters which aren't totally believable.I have to say that this movie was completely baffling to me. But there was a very creepy and gritty atmosphere built up. But for this viewer, it is not enough. A movie is supposed to be everything coming together to tell a visual story. Here the story is lost somewhere in the murk of the atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not easy to rate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no easy way to express my opinions on this film, so I will explain it.There may be spoilers in here.Background: I was sceptical when I started watching this movie. There used to be a time when I was captured by the hype and forced myself to believe slow Japanese movies simply have to be good. Anyone who does not like them, simply does not get it. Yet lately, I have come to understand that many of those movies really are just boring, shallow, and expressionless. Japanese movies are not great in general because of their nationality, just like American or German films are not. I just recently saw Dark Water and Tomie and thought they were very dull. I did not really expect this to be very different. Luckily, I was positively suprised. Right at the beginning I noticed how incredibly beautifully this film was shot. Towards the middle of it though, it seemed to me as if this would be just another bad Japanese movie. It developed all the signs of that. E.g. charachters that are unnaturally introverted, even for a Japanese; that don't talk about the things, that happen to them. You can't really connect to those charachters, they don't have much of a charachter development. We've got a lot of atmosphere shots, but nothing really happens. Just what I feared. This kind of movie is not arty or culturaly meaningful. Its just shallow. Yet, as the film went on, I noticed this one is different. It seems to criticize the japanese culture for this lack of communication. What I thought would be a bad charachteristic of it, is actually the central point of it. It seems like the director consiously displayed the charachters, the way I described before, not because this is just another boring japanese movie, but because he tries to criticize this charachteristic of the Japanese society. At some point in the movie it is being said that the ghosts attempt to capture the people in their eternal loneliness. This may be a very strong hint. In the end it seems like this movie does not merely inherit the same bad aspects of other movies but analyzes them and more so the society behind it. In the end it is being said that there seem to be people alive in Latin America. Guess why: because they talk! They communicate, talk about the ghosts and don't let themselves become lonely that easy. None of the Japanese charachters in this movie seem to have friends. The main charachter tells the girl with the car that he had one friend who he did not really know. He also said earlier that he maybe got an internet connection to meet people. I think this does all support my theory. What do you think?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "blurry things will scare you" flick. Decidedly average.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Righto, another Japanese ghost story along the lines of The Ring and The Grudge, among others. I hadn't heard of Kairo but picked it up off the shelf after reading some glowing blurb on the DVD cover, (Stupid. Stupid! STUPID!!). What I found was a depressing, disjointed and generally confusing piece of low rent film making in search of inspiration that never came. The basic premise of Kairo is that there simply isn't enough room for ghosts anymore, so they must find "other means" to be heard, and are often forced into the environment of the living. At least that is what I am going with, this thing is as confusing as f*ck. When I say "other means", in this case it means ghosts have gone high-tech, they are more internet savvy than most teens, and aren't averse to calling the odd mobile phone for a chat. Where the title Pulse comes in I have no idea, a more catchy title would have been Ghost Hackers, would've made more sense too. Now a bunch of stuff happens in Kairo and I'm sure if you took the time to watch it you might initially not notice that none of it makes sense whatsoever. It seems that from the early stages the ghost(s) seem to be targeting the employees of a Japanese plant store, as one by one they are bumped off. So this is a summary of the first hour: "Taguchi is missing? and he has the disk!" Shortly after: Exit Taguchi. "Oh no, not you too Yabe!" Exit Yabe. "The Boss too?" No more Boss. (Yay sickies for everyone!) "Now Junco!" It's like an "Axe-murderer slaughtering horny teens flick without the benefit of T&amp;A, gore and inventive kills. You might ask "What time does the next bus leave?", to which I would reply "What the hell type of question is that?". You might then more rationally ask "But is it scary, do they build tension?" Well now that's a better question. The answer? Not really aside from one scene that took forever, also made no sense, and then finished up by being a wannabe The Grudge out-take, not something I would aspire to. Sure there are the subliminal things that seem to come up a lot these days: - The reflection that can magically be enhanced and magnified from a crappy resolution image on a PC screen. - The "did I just see that?", rub the eyes, nothing there, "wait now it's back" thing. - The shadow on the edge of the screen walking behind while a "whoosh" sound effect is used to highlight the sheer scariness of it all. - The dimly lit room that when better lit shows a motionless person standing behind you. The one scene that is effective, occurs when one of our loyal Plantco employees visits The Forbidden Room. Now you aren't supposed to visit the Forbidden Room. Why? Because it's forbidden, that's why. The scene plays out like it should and while you wonder what is going on tension does build. Taking away a little is some ludicrously cheesy and offputting "Oooooohhhhh" music, (it's really bad). There are many more scenes that are quite randomly edited together so as to remove all continuity and not allow the tension to build. This frequently took me out of the movie as I was always on my heels wondering "Why are we back with this guy when 5 seconds ago we seemed to be right in the middle of the other girl doing something?" The Ring was a great remake of a Japanese horror flick, The Grudge less so but justified a look, The Uninvited mainly sucked. I know they have made a remake of Shutter but think that the original was good enough on its own. I know they have made remakes of many other Asian horror flicks and I haven't bothered looking most of them up. In the case of Kairo I think the US filmmakers had a better than normal chance of improving on the original, because it just isn't much chop in the first place and is all over the shop. Final Rating ? 5.5 / 10. All sloppy editing and pursuing a concept that isn't scary in the first place makes Kairo a dull movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts out well, limps to a long drawn out conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts out well, doing all the right stuff. It had me going for awhile.But it get's slower, and slower, and slower--not to mention murkier. It is one of those films that would have worked fine as a 90 minute movie--even with some flaws.But , anyway, this film goes on for about two hours, long after the viewer's interest has begun to wander and you've started scratching your head, wondering exactly what is happening.Toward the end it kind of degenerates into overly long scenes of people running around in blasted, derelict industrial buildings breathing very hard into their microphones and shouting uninspired, predictable dialogue.Some things just aren't very dramatic. Longish scenes of people poking around in pretty much abandoned industrial settings looking for stuff and breathing hard into their microphones isn't dramatic.By the end, we are working our way through a checklist of horror movie clichés in excruciatingly slow motion. Ancient horror movie clichés have to be executed with a certain cleverness, a certain panache, and perhaps a little inventive camera work/cutting. Some snappy dialogue, some attitude. Or maybe you just have to get them out of the way fast. That's not what happens in this film.The premise is rather interesting, but some of the exposition kind of conflicts with the stated premise--unless the stated premise was a red-herring. It's hard to tell from what they give you on screen and the film didn't motivate me to try to figure it out.So, nice idea, good start ... really, really slow, pretty much unimaginative ending.Maybe if they had had a bigger special effects budget ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ghost of a chiller, this is classic low budget spookiness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not to be mistaken with the empty and misdirected Aphex Twin video-styled American remake, the original Pulse is one of the creepiest films ever made. It's one of those horror films that catches you off guard by first coming across as an orthodox kind of ghost story before taking you way beyond the barriers of abnormal and just outright chills you to the bone.Japanese University students happen upon a phenomenon of student suicides triggered by something on the internet. Considering that Japan is rife with suicide amongst the young, this becomes the theme for much of the film.Lives become entwined when the close friends and family of the leads either disappear off the face of the earth or go on to kill themselves as the vastly overpopulated city they live in quickly becomes the loneliest place on earth, but then it becomes a global phenomenon.The few people left go about their lives regardless, getting lonelier by the day as the city becomes a haunting ground for the dead but it isn't long before they discover that somebody used the internet to find a way to look into the afterlife, which started the phenomenon. In a desperate race against time, the survivors look for a way to survive even though their will grows weaker every day as the haunting ghosts of the passed away quickly come to outnumber the living.Kiyoshi Kurasawa makes a point of living being no better than being dead if you become lonely enough. When the dead reach out to their victims, it isn't death that takes them but the loss of their will to live in loneliness when life becomes defeatist. By the characters' refusal to let their loved ones go and the refusal to see death as a tangible threat or something that exists where it shouldn't, they repel death although they don't want to live in this world anymore.Not only is loneliness unacceptable to the young, they cannot face the fact that in life, it comes to consume us all at one point sooner or later and so it seems to be about the fear of losing one's soul and identity to a life worse than death.The film takes its time in delivering the story and the shocks like a true ghost story and the little chills sometimes work the best or at least help to deliver the creepiest moments in film history. There's something about Japanese acting that sets you up for every moment realistic or absurd. It's all so well delivered and even if you're reading from subtitles, the point is put across in all devastating simplicity, making Pulse not only a creepy horror but also a tragic drama of epic proportions.The scenes of the city streets deserted and looking war torn when civilisation has simply vanished deliver some of the most impacting scenes in film and I guarantee that after this film you will be left feeling haunted.No cheap thrills, Pulse works hard to get into your mind and deliver an important message at the same time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kairo aka Pulse is a 2001 Japanese psychological horror film directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa and starring Haruhiko Katô and Kumiko Aso. The film(produced by the legendary Toho studios) is a modern day ghost story set in urban Japan which follows a group of young adults who are at the centre of a paranormal epidemic.The film follows the two parallel story lines involving Kudo (Kato)and Kawashima (Aso). Kudo is a young woman who works at plant shop and starts to notice something very wrong with her friends. After witnessing her friend Taguchi inexplicably hang himself at the beginning of the film, one by one Kudo's friends fall into despondent trances and lose the will to live. The victims often receive phone calls from the recently deceased who can only utter the words "help me" and Kudo soon starts to notice doorways lined with red tape appearing all over Tokyo.The Kawashima storyline offers more a of an insight into the mythos of the ghosts and explains that the spirit world has somehow found a portal to spill over into our world via the internet. Kawashima himself discovers a strange website which shows grainy snuff-like web cams featuring depressed individuals which asks the chilling question "Would you like to meet a ghost?". Through consulting university staff Harue and Yoshizaki it is further revealed that it is the isolation in Japanese youth culture that is creating these suicides, and that after realising there is no life after death people simply lose the will to live. The string of deaths eventually escalates in to an apocalyptic situation by which time the two story lines converge as Kudo and Kawashima try and escape the city and it's ghostly inhabitants together.Kairo is a very subtle and underplayed horror film, it won't necessarily make you jump or scare you as you watch it but the imagery and concept will stay with you long after the film finishes. It is certainly the look and feel of the film that gives it it's unique quality, the amateur webcam footage, the slow-mo effects and the look of the ghosts themselves. Instead of the over used pale-faced, long-haired Japanese ghost the film makers opt for a more classical style. For the most part the ghosts are simply shadows, against walls, lurking in public places etc. This is a brilliantly simplistic approach as it encourages the viewer to use their imagination and really engage with the themes of the film. Thematically speaking the film is very rich and philosophical, to understand the film fully though it is important to have some background knowledge on Japanese culture. Hikikomori is the Japanese phenomena referring to young adults who withdraw from society and isolate themselves in their houses, couple that with the well known suicide problem in Japan and you start to see what the film is really about. Which makes it all the more sinister.The trouble with Kairo however is no matter how metaphorically interesting it is or how eerie and unsettling some of the sequences are it is still, at it's core, a faintly silly premise. This was something much more apparent in the hideously misjudged American remake (Pulse 2006) but it's still there. The atmosphere and dread built up in the first half of the film is somewhat undermined by absurd conversations later in the film about how the spirit world is now full to the brim so now ghosts will invade our world and kill anyone they come into contact with. Simply putting red tape around a doorway seems like quite a flimsy safeguard against this and along with a number of other things is never really fully explained. It's a real disappointment that after engineering such a smart and thoughtful concept for a horror film that the execution feels a little bit clumsy and underdeveloped.If you can suspend your disbelief then Kairo is a great psychological horror film much in the same vein as Ringu (1998) or Dark Water (2002)with genuinely meaningful metaphors behind the scares. The fractured narrative is typical of the Japanese style and does require extra focus but if you let yourself be engaged you will be scared out of your wits. The film perfectly encapsulates the feelings of isolation, loneliness and despair which are certainly not exclusive to Japananese youth and also reflect a time when there was still much aprehension about the internet and it's effects. For these reasons Kairo should definitely be given a chance and just to reassure you, that shadow in the corner of your bedroom is definitely not a ghost.4 Stars **** Have you seen Kairo or Pulse (remake)? Did the film affect you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mysterious series of suicides start occurring in Tokyo, Japan. Several unconnected people try to understand the mysterious occurrences, but in the end they are forced to guess and doubleguess their theories with no real explanation to be found. People around them are found taping their doors with red tape, while a mysterious printout warns of the forbidden room. Within a matter of days life in the city has come to a stop with only a few rag-tag survivors roaming the streets...As it is said in circles this is an existential horror movie, which delves at times into philosophy, life, death and the concept of loneliness. With its unwavering negative message and unfailing dark haunting atmosphere it has the capacity to engulf and captivate. Even though the movie is extremely iffy as far as acting is concerned and the special effects may not be up to par to the American remake you can have no doubt that this is a far superior movie.Unlike the American "Pulse" it does however shy away from making a predictable and typical horror flick based on random scares and body counts (as in who is next). Instead it takes the route of creating such a consistent atmosphere that pulses you in with the terror lurking in fuzzy shots and not in shock sounds. But nonetheless it is not all that people make it out to be. The existential questions are thrown out in the movie, but they seem very random and inconsequential, almost like a forcible attempt to make the movie more meaningful than in reality. Also some of the scripting is well below par, as character actions lack the necessary cause-effect relation to make the film flow. Additionally too many events are chaotic and seemingly pointless, as though too much information from the book was cut from the script and this made it incoherent (like what is up with all the red tape?).A decent, unconventional and adventurous J-horror which is worth the time spent on watching it, but not deserving of the admiration thrown at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i watched hundred titles of Asian horror movie. and this is, my best Asian horror movie i've ever see since Noriko's dinner table and a tale of two sisters.this movie totally different than any other Asian horror film, it has no vengeful ghosts lurking around killing people, or haunting people like Shutter or Ju-On.after that, this movie has a deep meaning, philosophical, and totally haunting (yet beautiful). the atmosphere and cinematography were gorgeous and well done.i think this movie was beautiful, haunting, mesmerizing, and i LOVED this movie so much!!!!i don't have any problem with the extremely slow pace of this film. and i've watched this movie more than 35 times (yes, i counted on it). and i still loved it!! overall, i highly recommended this movie, but not for average ghost/slasher horror fans. if you want to see something different, watch this. but if you want anything about vengeful long-haired woman haunting people, you can pick many Thai/Korean/Japan horror flicks (Shutter, Alone, Coming Soon, Ju-On, Chakushin Ari, Arang, Ryeong, etc.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated and not scary at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because I was impressed by Cure. But compared to the earlier film, Pulse is a big disappointment. I was expecting Kurosawa to say something interesting about psychological terror, which he did masterfully in Cure. Instead, Pulse is a not-so-subtle indictment of the internet and how it makes young people feel alone and alienated. Not exactly a fresh idea. Plus the acting in this movie really sucks -- the kids are pretty whiny, and I didn't empathize with them at all. This movie needed a stronger actor, like Koji Yakusho from Cure (who only makes a cameo here). Hopefully, Kurosawa's next movie will be an improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is not for everyone---I found it VERY tough going</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There's a lot of mumbo-jumbo about the internet (i.e., if you install a program on the computer, you see dead folks--much like if you play a videotape you'll die in RINGU). Frankly, most of this seemed rather silly and lost me. What I did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence--being totally alone for eternity. This was sobering and fascinating.I love Japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most Americans. However, one genre that has become popular in recent years that I just can't relate to very well are these horror films. I know they are super popular--especially since they seem to be remade so often in the States. I've seen both RINGU as well as THE RING, JU-ON and THE GRUDGE and was rather ambivalent despite their popularity. About the only recent horror film I really liked from Japan was SEANCE--a reworking of the great British film, SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON. And what, do I think, made SEANCE different? Well, unlike the other films as well as KAIRO, gobs and gobs of money weren't spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience--instead, the emphasis was on the story. The bottom line is that these other films are a lot like American films like HALLOWEEN or Friday 13th--with scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary (at best). For me, I want story--not cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the film.With a relatively high rating, I know I am in the minority, but I just don't find this a very satisfying film. All too often, minor things occur that might startle someone slightly--but the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say "this is the scariest film ever made so you'd better start shaking". Well, I think it just tries too hard and I wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and plot progression--not scare tactics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not What You Might Expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in expecting a typical supernatural J-horror affair. Instead, I got a hauntingly emotive exploration of the nature of loneliness. This starts off like a straight horror film but becomes more esoteric as it progresses, with a focus on alienation and the desire and possible futility of connecting to others. Here, horror is an eternity of loneliness. Even the cinematography surrounding the characters evokes a sense of being alone even when together. For those who love a puzzle, there is plenty of symbolism as well as a unique and cryptic lore surrounding the preternatural elements, which you may find interesting to piece together. This is the kind of movie you understand more and more with each additional viewing. It does not offer answers on a silver platter, but leaves enough information for you to draw your own conclusions.Make no mistake: this is a horror film, albeit a more existential one. There are several extremely memorable and well done horror scenes that fans of the genre should eat up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulse (2001)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pulse (orig. Kairo, nothing to do with the capital of Egypt but instead translates to Circuit), later granted with a pointless US remake, is cult director Kiyoshi Kurosawa's attempt at crossing modern J-horror with social commentary. And, yeah, well, he did it. There's nothing spectacularly bad about this movie, but nothing mind-blowingly awesome either. It's just what it is - J-horror crossed with social commentary. And that's all I can say about it.Pulse follows two different story lines which connect later on in the film, but both have the same basis - people are mysteriously disappearing, there's some freaky computer stuff going on (websites that advertise communication with the dead), and random students investigating the ordeal. This is basically a story about alienation and how modern technology consumes us as people, not particularly subtle but also pretty cryptic as well. A lot of things are left to your own personal interpretation and it's hard to fully understand the storyline.About 3/4 in, the movie ditches its atmospheric ghost story elements and instead becomes an apocalyptic tale of survival, with people all around the world disappearing (Koji Yakusho, one of Kurosawa's regulars, appears as a ship captain during these scenes), and reveals that basically the majority of the film was a flashback. The apocalyptic reveal is certainly unexpected, but I wouldn't say it's all that clever. If anything, it ruins the movie because it completely shatters the entire unnerving atmosphere that the rest of the film was building up.But is it scary? Well, some parts are certainly uncomfortable, and the storyline itself is very creepy, but I can't say that this movie really scared me at all. Even though I think atmosphere is one of the most important aspects of a film to me, atmospheric horror films rarely do anything for me. Also, the dialogues/script here are pretty bland and don't give the actors much to work with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PULSEI love Japanese horror movies. I believe that the Japanese are the best at making horror. The atmosphere that these guys give the movies is what is the scary part.This movie is about a web site that apparently allows you to communicate with the dead. It all is not as it seems. People start killing themselves and it is down to 2 people to find out why their friends are dying.The film is very confusing. I watched this with a friend of mine and we both were wondering what was happening through the film. It is a shame because I was enjoying it, but even when the movie finished I was still not sure what the hell was going on with it. I had to Google the film to read the synopsis to confirm what it was about. The atmosphere was there which was good. There were times when it was a bit spooky and you wondered what was going to happen.The acting was good, but then I don't know any Japanese film where the acting is bad. I suppose it does make it better for them that I don't understand much Japanese. I did learn quite a bit a few years ago, but not enough to understand a film. If I could speak Japanese I wonder if I would still think they can all act very well. The movie stars Haruhiko Kato, Kumiko Aso and Koyuki.This film is good and I will watch it again to try and understand it a little more, but overall I was disappointed in it a little bit. I much preferred Ring, Battle Royale, Audition and Versus? these are my favourite Japanese films that I will watch soon hopefully and review for you.I will give this film 5 out of 10. Maybe I will give it more after the second watch? time will tell."Death was... eternal loneliness"For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie's pulse is racing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pulse" is a compelling, haunting, and insightful portrait of disconnection, loneliness, and the impersonal nature of technology. From the opening shot of the lone vessel adrift on a vast, turbulent ocean, Kiyoshi Kurosawa establishes a pervasive sense of foreboding and unnaturalness. The sequences throughout are effective in their restraint -- Kurosawa has no interest in shock scenes or excessive gore."Pulse" follows two intersecting story lines. One involves a young woman (Kumiko Aso) who works at a plant nursery in a high-rise building, whose investigation of a colleague's suicide leads her to some very murky places. The second strand follows a computer-illiterate student (Haruhiko Kato) who teams with a female geek (Koyuki) who's researching paranormal phenomena on the Internet. These characters encounter mysterious and frightening images on their computer screens. The images are linked to various disappearances.Significantly more original than American internet-related horror films, Kurosawa effectively focuses on the fear and melancholy resulting from the urban isolation that the Internet promotes. He is able to establish a sinister atmosphere with dark interiors, diffused tonal lighting, shadows, and delayed focus shifts. Kurosawa is less interested in tying up loose ends than in creating a sense of melancholy and depicting psychological states like dislocation. A bit redundant, but philosophical, atmospheric, genuinely scary horror films are few and far between. "Pulse" serves as a relevant social allegory on the dichotomy of human interaction and the self-induced alienation inherent in contemporary urban existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has haunted me for a year, so: review time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I watch horror movies, with a preference for spooky supernatural horror.This movie was unlike anything else we'd seen, and we talked about it on and off for days afterward. It probably helps if you've seen a LOT of unusual/indie movies -- end-of-the-world stuff like Carriers, The Crazies, Pontypool, or out-there twist supernatural movies like Heartless or Triangle, or zany "horror" movies like Fido, A Barking Dog Never Bites, and Delicatessen. Also mind-bending movies like Primer or just plain nonsensical but modestly disturbing movies like Mulholland Drive.If you enjoy those kinds of movies, and you don't mind not having everything explained or necessarily even "rational", then I think you'll find Pulse to be an _exceptionally_ good ghost story that sticks with you for a long time.Often when I'm sleepy and it's late, I find my thoughts wandering back to the characters, the imagery and the overall premise. It fills me with a strange sense of dread, almost an ache. It's been over a year since I saw the film, and it still haunts me occasionally. I think that's a sign of a pretty good movie.I just wish the film had been less blurry. I watched it on Netflix over a questionable connection, and we don't know to this day whether the film quality was just grainy (maybe on purpose), or if it was due to lossy compression.People have said (rightly) that this is a movie about loneliness. But make no mistake -- it's also a movie about the end of the world, so don't expect it to be a pick-me-up or happy ending.</fullReview>

The filming is flawless, perfect colors, Kurosawa describes calmly how at the end of summer, human race began to slowly vanish from the surface of the earth. There's no fancy effects during the scenes showing the ghosts, the actors emotions are rare and deep. the scary moments are based on non aggressive monsters, who are disturbing because they looks like humans but are in fact remnants of their own entity trapped into "eternal isolation", and all this is filmed with the magnificent descriptive/pessimistic Kurosawa style.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiyoshi Kurosawa does it again with this extremely atmospheric ghost story about the dangers of excessive reliance on technology. It is his undoubted masterpiece and refuses to play nice with the audience. Isolation, dehumanization and industrial decay all creep into the narrative and stick in your mind's eye long after you've finished watching it. Being a bit of a nihilist myself, the feeling of desolation and despair as well as the extremely creepy "ghosts in the machine" that haunt the film really turned my crank. Kurosawa has a perfect eye for this kind of stuff and he has yet to make a mediocre movie, let alone a bad one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kairo concludes with an apocalypse, with archetypal images of the end, empty city streets and the last survivors of disaster. It concerns itself with an eschatology of the soul of course, but what about its metaphor, what is the end it foreshadows in the present life? Kairo's failure as a great film is twofold for me. One is a failure of a story that makes poor sense. One random happenstance is presaged by another. Moments before the boy randomly encounters the girl of a disparate plot strand so they can forward the story together, he discovers a curious vending machine standing in an empty corner street, he goes over to buy a drink and finds the door of the vending machine magically open of its own accord. The happenstance of a similar event in Seance is meaningfully fateful, here it's an excuse.The other is a failure of metaphor. We got this year in The Social Network that modern technology, our growing obsession with being logged on and tuned in, fosters alienation and when Hollywood has something to say it's usually long past a point of awakening. Back in 2001 the point may very well had been an important one, not too late but certainly not too early it foreshadowed our reality.What matters for me is the meditation on the idea, than the idea itself. The shots of haggard individuals anguishing in dreary rooms, reclining in various states of spiritual decomposition. Kairo mythologizes and tells us these people are ghosts, what strikes a chord for me is the absence of faces or discernible characteristics or their unstable walk, existence hanging in the balance with this suggested loss of identity.Kairo's horror is not simply one of alonenness for me, it's one of dissolution of the self. The metaphysical aspect of this I feel is hampered by the pursuit of a mythologic frame, of a world of ghosts invading our own, as such I consider this film inferior to Seance which I saw a few days ago, though it may be a sensual triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb horror permeated with social commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking for a good horror movie to watch, and I decided on this because it got some pretty good reviews and looked fairly interesting. Also, I've never seen any sort of Asian horror before, but I like the few horror classics I've seen (Halloween, Scream, etc.). What I got was way beyond your average horror flick with subtitles.I'm in my fourth year of studying Japanese, so I'm fortunate enough to have a decent understanding of the language and culture, and it helped immensely to know at least a bit of the rapidly changing state of Japan's culture from its proud, individualistic roots to today's insulated, tech-centered society. All Japanese are also known for being very polite, but with this comes a sort of isolation with avoidance of almost any physical contact. All three of these traits are explored in the movie; though loneliness and alienation are an element of American society as well, they are not nearly as ingrained in our culture as they are in that of the Japanese.And if this doesn't sound like a horror film, don't worry, because Kurosawa is fortunately a skilled enough director to weave this into the slow-developing but immensely appropriate horror device unique to this movie. I don't even understand it fully after having watched it, but if you can't suspend your disbelief, why the hell are you watching a horror movie? What counts is that it is really creepy, suitably convoluted, and it serves the film's message of loneliness perfectly - the combination of all three make it gut-wrenching to see some of the things that happen.If this piques your interest, don't hesitate to see it, and it's best to watch it at night by yourself, or at least with a friend who also wants to concentrate on it, because it has a profoundly atmospheric, desolate, and almost dreamlike mood that shouldn't be broken by side conversation. Don't see it under any conditions without a brain ready to think, and if you're familiar with Japanese culture you get brownie points for being able to understand many of the movie's subtleties that would fly over the heads of American viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film with such high expectations after reading so many glowing user reviews on IMDb. Perhaps my expectations were set too high, I don't know, but it failed to deliver on all counts. If blurry images of people are likely to scare you then this is definitely the horror film for you. I may as well have just taken my spectacles off and looked at my house mate for an hour and a half though. The story is so disjointed and I spent the majority of my time discussing what the hell was going on with my house mate. He didn't know either. Neither of us are idiots but we are massive horror fans. The characters turn up at what are meant to be significant locations but you've got no idea where these places are or what significance they play in the film. I can kind of see what they were trying to do with the film but it felt like they were trying to be too clever and then did a rush job putting it all together. If the scares were good then it would have saved the wishy-washy story, but my grandma with her false teeth out is ten times more scary than people standing around in dim light looking at the camera.</fullReview>

While director Kiyoshi Kurosawa got the mood right, it wasn't a particularly scary movie, which is the darnedest thing, since he managed to build up a good amount of tension in some scenes and yet they deflated. The story is semi-interesting and semi-WTF. Actually, I'm kinda reading the Wiki summary as I'm writing this and it seems a lot more interesting than what came across in the movie - maybe because I got kinda bored and tuned out at some point. I think the problem with having a lot of enervated people with a gloom-and-doom ambiance is that it'll take a lot of skill to not have the movie enervate the audience too, and Kurosawa didn't pull that off, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite not having one scene where something ill-defined and much less pleasant to look at jumps at the viewer in that "Boo" gesture -- a requisite and staple of modern horror -- Kiyoshi Kurosawa's KAIRO is an unnerving collection of disturbing images that are so freakish in nature as to make the skin creep in bouts of goose-flesh. All throughout, there's this escalating dread that like the slow advance of these people who are not quite "there", and it just keep on tightening its noose, as if asking one to put the DVD on pause or maybe even turn it off altogether. And for someone like me who keeps on stating that the horror genre is dead, this just made me eat my words.For years, horror movies have been about the way we encounter the supernatural, and the way it haunts us. All of the modes of employ have been used up and exist only as backdrop. There are no longer haunted houses where an ancient curse befell a family -- though I may have to cross that out as JU ON is exactly about that. No longer do Dracula or the Werewolf or Frankenstein (and a huge roster of other monsters) scare us, and the more esoteric entries into its web are stale. It was only time when what we do use on a daily basis -- phones, faxes, printers, television, and of course the World Wide Web -- would be the harbinger that could thin the layers separating us from those who are in another dimension and create an escalating panic.Two stories play themselves out until they dove-tail at the right moment in KAIRO. The first one concerns Michi, a girl working at a plant store in Tokyo. She notices that a co-worker, Taguchi, hasn't shown up for work in a week, and decides to check in on him. When she arrives at his apartment, he seems fine to her, but when she goes searching for a particular disk she needs, he hangs himself. Later on Michi and two other co-workers notice that within Taguchi's files there is a strange picture of his own room and what seems to be Taguchi standing still to the side of his computer, which is also showing the same image. They notice a face on a second computer, and a blow-up shows it to be that of Taguchi's, blankly staring out.Yabe then receives a phone call from Taguchi -- which is impossible -- and goes to his apartment to find Taguchi's body gone (of course) except for a black smear on the wall where he was found dead. As he leaves, he sees a door framed in red tape which catches his attention, so much that he makes the mistake of opening it. Once he does, he has one frightening encounter, one of the strangest, and scariest, I've ever seen in horror movies.It seems that within Taguchi's disk seems to contain a horrific virus that is spreading rapidly, causing mass suicides all throughout Tokyo. One in particular is gruesome even when seen from a distance as Michi is on the phone: a woman throwing herself off a high tower, her body hitting the floor in a flat thud.The second story makes itself present by introducing itself as another young man's incursion to the Internet. Ryosuke is getting his Internet installed on his computer, but the package seems to have a malfunction: immediately he is introduced to a bizarre website that presents images of people in the act of being alone in their bedrooms, languid, tired, on the veer of terrified. A prompt ("Would you like to see a ghost?") freaks him out and he disconnects the computer immediately, but it turns itself on again, and an unsettling image of a person, his head covered in a black bag, plays itself.What neither of them know is that from the other side, something has seeped its way into the world of the living. It is malevolent in ways that is only hinted at, as the dead feed off the life-force of those who are alive and literally turn them into ash. One explanation points at something that began almost innocuously -- a seed -- but has grown to such size that it is now using computers as a way to filter its way through and walk among us. Kurosawa inter-cuts this explanation with one extremely queasy image: that of an empty room lit in a sick-green light, as an apparition materializes. That as well as many, are what make KAIRO so overwhelmingly terrifying.Where KAIRO may limp just a little is in its plot pacing and decisions made by its characters. For example, computer geek Harue's (Koyuki) own crucial left turn is an exclamation point of logic but an overpowering descent into virtual hell seen in low resolution video, complete with hoots and clicks and her terrified smile of relief as she embraces something unspeakable. Despite this, it is drenched in sepia tones and suffocating anxiety -- it's the tension that doesn't find an automatic release, but gets stronger and stronger, without stopping for a rest. And nothing is so frightening as to see the vaguely formed image of a man moving so freakishly towards you as you are unable to react, and once he is up and close, all you see are his eyes, staring, quite alive, as he tells you he is real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful and Creepy, if not altogether Convincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thoughtful AND Creepy. Two words not used in tandem to describe many recent domestic Horror films. One of the key secrets to the recent Asian Horror boom is that the films and the filmmakers take their subject seriously. Not content to either just 'gross out' the audience or to be ironic and coy about the genre (or both) as most USA Horror films are these days, Directors like Kurosawa here delve into the very meaning of life and death. There is, of course, a subgenre of gore films such as AUDITION and the recent THREE EXTREMES, but even those display a deeper psychological bent than is found in most domestic product. That stated, PULSE isn't all of a piece. The early section is slow and somewhat meandering is setting up the situation (there isn't a strong enough plot to really term it a "storyline"). Further, having been made in 2001, one might get a little impatient that they felt it necessary to drag out the explanations of how the internet runs. A College student who doesn't know how to Bookmark an internet page? Still, once the situation is set up and the events go into motion it's a creepy ride, fueled in large measure by the serious tone and even thoughtful discussion of WHY the ghosts are here, and what the meaning our lives today are. These ghosts are clearly symbolic. They force the "living" to examine their own lives. A world in which it is easier to communicate via a computer than it is with a co-worker in the same living, breathing workspace.SPOILERS ALERTAt this point, the film takes a sharp turn into an apocalyptic vision of an entire Japan, and perhaps, the entire world being taken over by the ghosts. The transition from a story of a small group of young people to an ON THE BEACH-like waiting for the end of the world scenario isn't' entirely convincing, sobering as it may be.Not surprisingly, an American Remake is on the way. What is the betting line on what gets more play in the USA version - The Horror, Action and Special Effects or the Philosophical Discussions on the meaning of existence in the Modern World?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My pulse remained constant...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so excited to finally watch "Pulse" after receiving it from Amazon, and I have to say I was utterly disappointed. I perhaps think I was too hyped up. I had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew this would find a place in my heart.The story was slow, painfully so. I am a diverse fan of horror. I love the brutal, bloody craziness of "The Devil's Rejects" and I love equally the steady, growing macabre of "A Tale of Two Sisters". "Pulse" offered little from either spectrum, sadly.Along with the sluggishness of the plot, it was also very muddled. I hadn't a clue why characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem. It seemed as if the director spouted off the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was improf from our actors. Unlike "A Tale of Two Sisters", which also has a rather hard-to-follow plot line, "Pulse" clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated, confused and uninterested in the characters' endeavors. My closing statement about the plot was its inconsistency. At first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world overflowing and their medium of escaping is the Internet. That's a damn original idea. I like that. But as the plot drones on, plot-holes and unexplained happenings rearing their heads in, it seems the director switched to some apocalyptic tale (as evident by the ending) that just hasn't been clear enough throughout to execute.I realize the dreariness of the shots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated, but the dullness of the movie was only intensified by the grainy, shadowy surroundings. I will admit there was a certain feel of surrealism with the movie, but that may have just been my attention waning in and out.The actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well, and perhaps if I was more enthralled by the story I would've been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being unmotivated so too were some of the characters. Like I mentioned previously, the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot. Perhaps it was a result of the plot's incoherence that the characters do questionable things. To be honest I don't really care.The acting was decent. Certainly nothing outstanding but nothing terrible either. No outliers to mention on either side of brilliant or plain awful.Now I'll stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of creepy moments. One towards the end especially that if there were more like it throughout, I would've enjoyed this movie (almost) wholly. I thought whenever the website was shown it was pretty unsettling, as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face. The things that went on between these ghastly run-ins were just too lackluster, baffling and "WTF" for me to truly appreciate.Now for something pertaining to the DVD itself... Magnolia's release of "Pulse" comes with subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are off. They aren't said at the correct time of the character's speech. It may sound nit-picking but it bothered me a little and it may bother some others. I think this is the only North American release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing (NEVER WATCH DUBBING!!!) I tried to like the film, I really did. I WANTED this film to live up to the hype... but sadly, it fell flat for me. If you're looking for other creepy Asian cinema I can recommend you "Audition", "Shutter", "A Tale of Two Sisters", "Strange Circus" and "Marebito" -- all of which are more my palette.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transmissions from the End of the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me be perfectly clear: I am not a fan of J-Horror. Ringu and the Grudge were tedious. That was enough for me. Audition? Forget about it. I guess it is, as they say, different strokes for different blokes. Pulse, though, rises above the other scary movies finding their way out of Japan because it's not small--Pulse is an epic, apocalyptic nightmare of a movie. It's terrifying but the terror boils under the surface. The film didn't make me jump, but it got under my skin and gave me chills. Like the novel the House of Leaves, the premise is just twiggy enough to tolerate for a while. When the movie gets deeper and deeper into its tale, though, you start feeling those claws grip at you. By the end, you're in its vice- like grip, chilled to the bone. It's an awesome experience and very much unlike my other favorite horror films. It's a more visceral conceptual terror than you have in Romero's Dead films but it's not as visceral as Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's not as beautiful as Argento or Bava, but it has crisp lines and significantly better acting than the films of those masters. I'm not going to try too hard to describe the plot of Pulse. Basically, the Internet kills people. I think. Some strange explanations are thrown out but they really don't suffice as explanations. If you're looking to be spoon fed rational horror, watch the American remake. You have been warned. Why was this scary? I dunno--I think it was because about three-quarters of the way through, you realize that everyone is disappearing. It's a terrifying though. Here you are, a young person trying to make their way through contemporary life in Tokyo and then it hits you--there's no one around any more. This concept preys on our most basic fears of isolation and disorientation. It's something out of a dream. The ghosts just sort of serve as conduits for Kurosawa to explore contemporary isolation and alienation. It's a brilliant maneuver. Like I said, though, if you're looking to jump out of your skin, go elsewhere. If, however, you get chills thinking about being completely alone in a megalopolis or if the thought of a house bigger on the inside than it is on the outside frightens you, then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One major pattern most Asian horror films follow is deadened pace. Too often Japanese filmmakers remain a little too laid back in their story-telling. Their films, despite capturing your attention visually, lumber along and instead of entertaining they lull the viewer to sleep or worse boredom. In this film perhaps it's the characters that kept me from really integrating myself into the plight of they who are struggling within this, but most of the time the story just simply either takes too long to develop or meanders without hitting the target goal. The film follows two people for a while, Harue(Koyuki)and Kawashima(Haruhiko Katô)as they watch civilization vanish thanks to these ghostly apparitions which have found a place out of their realm into ours. The process seems to seduce the loneliness from within each individual eventually "taking" them over or something(..what really occurs just doesn't have much true explanation). We watch as they try to fight what has happened to all those around them, but the apocalyptic doom leaves little hope for them. Death leaves a "residue" which shows the viewer that those who were human have now been "turned" over to the dead. One of the ghosts admits that death is a lonely existence which might explain why they wish to exist in our plane, but that isn't quite elaborated on either. Nothing within the story is ever truly explained, whether how anyone was able to come to the knowledge of how to keep ghosts at bay with red tape or how the ghosts work within our world. Sure, we have characters guess and try to explain to us what they feel it is, but how(and, better yet, why)they operate and kill just doesn't get told to us. We see two people alone in an entire city once vibrating a beat of crowds now down to just them(..why they are able to escape such a fate for their time isn't explained either). One thing that really bothered me was an introduction to a third character who is supposed to narrate to us how it all began. She(that being Kumiko Aso's Michi)is introduced to us nearly 90 minutes in and we are supposed to just accept her after all that has already taken place. Harue, for some unknown reason not quite ever explained even when she is "absorbed", separates herself from Kawashima and goes to her apartment where the computers show a ghost for which she'll soon become. This sequence among so many aren't quite explained but merely open to interpretation. This film seems to use spooky happenings and ghostly apparitions merely as a tool to confront it's main story..how we as a community of people isolate ourselves from everyone else. Our technological advancement has assisted in the progressive separation from the outside world. The ghosts that have to find a new home will have a nesting place here where the living wish to die(..the opening and closing show many sad souls just wishing to end their not so wonderful lives). Ultimately, the film does seem to explain one thing right, death is a cold, lonely place and we that are alive ought to appreciate our time on earth. I chalk this up as an interesting failure.Kurosawa has captured our minds visually as the world seems to be desolate once everyone is taken away, but misses because the ghosts and their story just aren't quite developed enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK but far from perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a true fan of Japan horror in general, but I did not find the voting results of this piece at IMDb fair to what I did see. The piece can't simply compete with other Japan horrors who's into the same style (for example; "Ringu" &amp; "Dark Water"). It's OK, but I felt time from time that it was very confusing, and at some parts it was rather difficult to keep up with the twisted storyline and the development of the movie. I like the atmosphere of this piece, but I'm afraid it's too weak to turn out in a movie highscore. I wish they had added more depth to the characters and perhaps some more depth to the story itself in general, to put more perspective on what's really going on. Anyhow, it's well worth it's time it serves in the VCR and if you're into Japan horrors, well this one might entertain you for tonight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It wants to scare you (slight spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie weren't trying so hard, it would be scarier. Like many horror films, it sets to work on us right from the beginning, before anything is happening to be scared about: immediately the Psycho music kicks in and the camera moves jarringly. These devices have the effect on me of recognizing them to be independent of what the screen's showing. At the same time, the movie develops in the standard deliberate monotone of Japanese thrillers, but whereas in some of them, e.g. Ring, the audience is actually being fed information at a steady rate, here it has to wait a long time to find out what's going on, and this does not particularly arouse curiosity. It is quite interesting, however, once it's revealed--more interesting than the story that's built around it. Although the theme--the erosion of the line between the living and the ghostly--is accurately illustrated by the central image--ghostlike figures on monitors--somehow the phenomenon seems not quite to jibe with the explanation of it. And the last stage of the invasion, if it can be called that, happens very suddenly, and I don't understand how it came to happen. (This section of the movie looks a lot like anime.)This director's films all tend to remind me of other movies. Cure is like Angel Dust, and this one is like Ring, with computers. To me they never seem to get far beyond the resemblances; never seem quite to get where they're going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just went on and on forever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a major disappointment for me. I am a huge fan of horror movies, and Asian horror movies in particular. So I so this DVD cover and picked it up. The DVD cover does look promising, a fairly weird face covered in black with a toothless open mouth. So it was with a heart full of anticipation I put this movie on.And wow, the movie just kept on going forever and ever. Perhaps it seemed longer because I lost interest in it fairly early along the way.There were no scare factors or scary moments in the movie, though there were a bit suspense, but hardly enough to be called horror. And that is where I fell off the wagon and lost interest.The story deals with people disappearing and is caught somewhere between life and death, and is capable of communicating with people through the computers and internet. Yeah, it is a good enough base for a story, but it just didn't work out all that well.As for the cast, well there were no one that I immediately recognized in the movie. And I must say that the lead guy and girl were doing a rather bad job, especially the guy. It seemed like he would rather be somewhere else doing something else."Kairo" is very different from the 'standard' Japanese horror movies that make it to the market. It might be good with some deviation, but this movie just failed to leave a lasting impression. There are many other far better Japanese horror movies available, and you might be better off with one of those...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your pulse won't be racing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Japanese horror (which had a quite a belated release for western audiences) seemed to have impressed many viewers, but for me it wasn't entirely the case. 'Kario' is a dreary supernatural industrial techo thriller that never seemed to get going and establish enough meat upon its themes of technology advancement leading to loneliness and being frightened of the unknown. It's got a complex and fascinating base to work off, but it comes off being incoherent and overlong as the idea seems too big with its unfocused intentions. While the cluttered narrative plods along (at least it's unpredictable), it's director Kiyoshi Kurosawa's gloomy and at times chilling imagery that commands your attention. A couple moments can cause goosebumps, but genuinely can't sustain that edginess throughout even with the looming dread amongst the working class urban setting. The environment paints a shady and cold look like something of apocalyptic proportions. Visually speaking it had everything going for it and Junichiro Hayashi's sprawling cinematography sumptuously lenses every frame. Some flashes of arty pretensions seep in. The eerily sicking and subtly shuddery music score pushes all the right buttons. Hayashi's patiently crisp handling is broodingly tailored, alienating and is basically all mood? or otherwise you could call it undoubtedly bland. Your choose? The characters are quite a forgettable and senselessly disposable bunch of saps who struggle to feel any empathy for. Kumiko Aso, Shun Sugata and Haruiko Kato simply cruise through it with distant performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best J-horror movie, just to many incomprehensible plot points and going's on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seemed interesting enough to start, but I quickly became lost as the plot goes from one set of characters (greenhouse workers) to another (the dude who was just starting to play with the computer and the computer major). Apparently, people are committing suicide for reasons that really aren't making much sense at all. There is a also ghosts popping up and a theory on them and then the suicides still don't make much sense. There is some commentary on isolation in modern society due to the internet, which could be the main problem for me. I am not one to be scared at the prospect of being alone, I in fact thrive on it as I just don't care for people that much anyway so that removes the main fear causer of the film for me so therefore it is destined to be disappointing. Still, it could have worked had a couple of points been fleshed out a bit more. One minute a dude is looking on a website and it mentions the forbidden room the next thing you know he is there at one of these rooms that are not explained at all (well I couldn't pick up on anything that explained their reason in the movie). Anyone who goes in to these rooms seems destined to die, if they in fact look at the disturbing things there (well it isn't that disturbing really). There is a rather good scene where a couple is driving through a dying and deserted city, but once again why were they doing this? I don't see what drove them to suicide even factoring in the loneliness theme. Just to much left unexplained, I like some mystery, but the point of a movie is to tell a story and this one does not do that very well for me. I do wonder if the red tape on the forbidden room was kind of taken from a Japanese short called "Crevices" or vise versa? Now that little short didn't explain anything either, but it was more effective than this movie in presenting itself.</fullReview>

Please don't confuse me with someone who thinks horror means blood guts and false scares. Indeed, Kairo has, at times, a delicious brooding unnerving sense of dread, and some undeniably classic visuals and moments. But I found myself becoming less and less affected as the movie progressed, irritated even, that such a tantalizing idea was being drained of it's primal effectiveness. In the end, the haunting deeply felt fear that Kairo sporadically creates is left stranded, and the only thing that I talked about after-wards was how it should've been better.</fullReview>

Bad CGI plane crash at the end is the worst Cg effect and isn't really needed. Nor is much of the running time, the pacing just gets slower and slower and we have less and less people as the plot unfolds so you got few people with less happening.Murky story doesn't help and a sort of stoic Japanese feeling keeps things from every exploding into the full fledged panic the story wants to demand, instead it's methods of scaring you become rather predictable and too much is left unexplained. At least there is no long haired little girl in it. Good potential here for a better remake which could bring out the suggested themes and give the damn thing a sense of urgency.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I started watching the movie I initially enjoyed it. I found it quite suspenseful and atmospheric; the message that loneliness was a risk in modern society felt very interesting. After a while, however, the story seemed to become quite diffuse, containing several plot lines and events that were hard to combine. The movie wants to make a statement about society, but the unnecessary complexity of what is unfolding detracts from the clarity of the message. There is always suspension of disbelief in supernatural films, but I didn't feel that Kairo provided clarity through its alternate reality. As other comments mentioned, the movie feels like it was written on a day-by-day basis, rather than having a destination in place from the beginning to guide the movie's plot.</fullReview>

Can someone please give me a coherent explanation?2) Not Scary At All I was watching this movie alone in the dark, *YAWN*, Nothing really scared me at all...

		<shortDescription>Does this even deserve a genre?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cant even describe how terrible this movie is. It started off very interesting with the tagline "do you want to meet a ghost?" I've always been a fan of Asian horror movies so I decided to give this movie a try after reading some of the reviews on this site and rotten tomatoes. As I started watching this, I was waiting with anticipation to see what kind of story would be unfolded; the movie ended and still nothing had happened except the best part--the credits. How did this even get passed off as a movie???????? Some things I will never understand!This movie was seriously overrated. It has a pretty slow build up that just eventually levels off because you start dozing off. My friend literally fell asleep on me in the middle of this movie. He woke up and was like "Did I miss anything?" And folks you already know what my response was. The characters in this movie were so static. They had no character development and heck, when they died I didn't feel anything at all. I actually felt happy because that was one less character who would potentially add a subplot and drag out this horrible movie. You feel no attachment to any of the characters in this movie nor do you care what they are doing or what is going to happen to them. To answer my question, yes, this movie does deserve a genre. It belongs in the trash. I didn't like this movie, but you might so you can still give it a try. Just don't watch this movie with the expectations of an actual thriller/horror. This movie is extremely slow paced and gets caught up in its own storyline. I understand that not every movie will have a suspenseful/"scary" part but if you want to make a horror/thriller part you need SOMETHING at least! Throw me a scary face or something will ya?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about ghosts, both living and dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although perhaps not a great film in the traditional sense, Pulse (2001) is nonetheless a completely fascinating work, offering a great mood and atmosphere rife with claustrophobia and a continual sense of loneliness and cultural alienation. The themes and concerns expressed here are very much Japanese in context - both in terms of their design and in their actual presentation - with the slow pace, inexplicable supernatural element and concern over the growing seclusion and alienation of Japanese youth enslaved by their technology. It would seem to be a persistent fear/concern for most Japanese filmmakers, with other films, such as the massively successful Ringu (1998), Shinya Tsukamoto's Bullet Ballet (1997) and Takashi Miike's masterpiece Visitor Q (2001) also looking at the breakdown in communication between the different generations, as well as the overwhelming and often negative effect that technological dependence and consumer culture has had on the post-war generation, in regards to slowly eradicating the basic principles of traditional Japanese social values.The central character of Pulse is a clear representation of this phenomenon; secluded in his small flat, wandering lonely through nocturnal streets and attempting to master the use of his home computer in the apparent attempt of forging a literal connection with other, similarly lost souls. However, instead of attempting to create a straight drama from such a pertinent social dilemma, director Kyoshi Kurosawa has instead presented the idea within the context of a horror film. It is important to establish and appreciate these deeper themes if you're hoping to get the most out of this film, as Kurosawa structures it in such as way as to create horror from the simple premise of globalised alienation. Is the theme successfully conveyed? Well, perhaps... but that eventual judgement will really be down to the individual. Regardless, the film presents an intelligent idea - backed by a series of stark, atmospheric and heavily cryptic images - and invites the audience to interpret them on a subjective and entirely personal level. It can occasionally be quite confusing, with the film often feeling incredibly austere or dreamlike. A waking nightmare of sorts in which the loneliness and alienation of one character is visualised on an almost apocalyptic scale. There's also the theme of suicide and the various social taboos and spiritual aspects that such a notion can present in regards to the afterlife, which again, comes back to the central idea of alienation and characters being disconnected from other characters, even in death.If there is a representation of the afterlife here then it is one that is every bit as lost and lonesome as the depressing presentation of our everyday life, with the characters here forced to live out every morbid, repetitive, soul destroying action again and again in the most excruciating detail. This is where the horror aspect of Pulse arises; not in scenes of quick cuts and the occasional burst of loud, spectral noises, but in the cultural wind of change, melancholy and alienation in which the empty, soulless void that for many people can come to represent their everyday life spills over into the eternal afterlife; giving us the representation of ghosts haunted by their own terrified memories of a life they never knew. If you attempt to view this within the context of a conventional, westernised idea of what a horror film should deliver you may be incredibly disappointed. As with the majority of Japanese cinema, the mood is sombre, the narrative slow and the characters prone to much in the way of silent brooding. However, if we view the film within the context of the social and spiritual concerns described above we get a greater sense of the true horror threatening these characters.The depiction of drab, empty loneliness presented here is frightening and very unsettling; with the gloomy cinematography, ambient music and grey, minimal production design turning Tokyo into a cavernous, empty ghost-town of truly epic proportions and reminding me very much of Danny Boyle's similar, socially aware nightmare 28 Days Later (2002). Whereas that film targeted post 9/11 fear and the rising sense of aggression apparent in British youth, Pulse takes isolation, technological overload and the loss of traditional Japanese values and creates a labyrinthine underworld of wandering lost souls, both living and dead. The ending of the film takes these concerns and turns them into something epic and apocalyptic, but the focus remains tied to the human struggle. Yes, it can at times be slow and muddled, and does requires a great sense of understanding Japanese cultural taboos to really becomes accessible, however, this is a fascinating film; one that despite falling short of true greatness is nicely directed and very much worth experiencing by anyone with a fondness for films that make you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wasn't a horror movie; just a horrid movie. Now I've seen and liked The Grudge (both US &amp; Japanese versions) and Audition, so don't think I'm in some way biased against Japanese horror or films. This film is not just worth the time, and it feels like a LONG time. I watched this with five friends and after an hour-and-a-half one asked, "Does this movie END?" The plot is week and contradicting, and the depth of the characters is shallow. I felt no sympathy for the characters as they were apparently compelled to give up on life. This film was SLOW, never managing to build suspense and usually cut away (often disjointedly) when any suspense did try to build. When any "shocking" moment did occur there was no thrill; just a sense of relief that something finally happened. I did like some of the cinematography (such as a scene through the city at the end) as it often worked well to set the mood, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to salvage the story. I'm not looking for blood and gore for a horror movie to be good, but it has to be more than just bleak and despairing. Anyone who actually thinks this was scary might consider therapy and stay away from more frightening fare like Disney's Black Cauldron or Bambi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mind slow films (hey, Tarkovskijs "Stalker" is a favourite film of mine...) but this film was beyond boring and uncompelling. And the story itself was quite stupid at times (like someone pointed out earlier with the guy who went through the red door for the gas cap, c'mon!).*spoilers*It had a few neat touches like the apocalyptic scenario at the end and the female freefall dive camera shot. But that (a total of 10 minutes?) doesn't make up the film as a whole.And it wasn't scary.Nah, skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First draft of what could have been a fine movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kairo (Pulse or Circuit in English) feels like a movie which was shot without a script or even an outline. The director starts with an interesting idea and simply rambles thereafter, throwing one interesting idea or cool visual effect after another at the viewer with only the vaguest idea of why or how one leads to another. The movie relies excessively upon a heavy handed score to create apprehension in the viewer, and the characters repeatedly fall victim to the tried and true horror convention of splitting up just at the moment that the imminence of danger would dictate sticking together, and doing exactly what everyone in the audience is screaming at them not to. If you do see this film, be sure to compare it to Ring, a J Horror movie that is only much scarier (without being tedious and repetitive) but also makes sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only heard about this movie after seeing the 2006 American remake. While the remake was certainly not a great movie, this is one of those cases where it was an improvement upon the original."Kairo" is, above all else, slow-paced and traumatically boring. The editing is laughably poor at points as well, with one scene abruptly chopping off into another in a manner that leaves the viewer scratching his head as to what just happened.If you can stay awake through the first forty-five tranquilizing minutes, you'll then be treated to such earnestness, such seriousness and gravity, that you will yourself wish you could be sucked into the nearest wall. Perhaps you will be. This film is quite capable of dissolving the viewer into a puddle of black goo.The one bright spot in this film is the setting. The imagery here does manage to create a palpable air of loneliness and human isolation. Unfortunately, in the overall context, this has the effect of largely alienating the viewer, too. Perhaps that's what it was intended to do, but with the rest of the film plodding along and taking itself so seriously, it doesn't save this sinking ship. The American version at least brought in a few suspense-building elements; the Japanese version has none of this. There's nothing here to draw the viewer into the story, and so the overall effect is quite a bit like ambient Muzak on an elevator. This film is best used as background noise with an occasional glance while the viewer does something more useful with her time.</fullReview>

Metaphors for man's isolation in the modern world, blah-blah-blah, yadda-yadda....I once wrote a 10-page paper on the imagery of red and white in the partisan assassination scene of "Dr. Zhivago". It was BS and so is this film.There is a bit of creepy imagery, which is the only reason that I gave this 3 stars instead of just 2. The sound editing is poor and the pacing is abysmal.I'm going to be generous and assume that the English subtitles were not up to par. Perhaps there's another level of meaning in the original Japanese. As it stands, it is basically identical to the first project of a recent film school graduate.</fullReview>

My (Japanese) wife borrowed the DVD from her friend and watched it last night - today she told me it was "scary" and that she had enjoyed it. Please bear in mind that my wife's favourite film of all time is Mannequin(!)This afternoon I sat down to watch the disc myself - I switched it off after 30 minutes because, basically, it was just wasting my time.Dark, dull and unengaging, Kairo is a Ringu wannabe but it has neither the script or the pace to come anywhere close. Reading the other comments on here it seems that Kairo is popular with others, so maybe you need to be a horror fan to appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Worth It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm actually surprised how highly rated this movie is on here considering all the other, much better Asian horror films on the market. I went into this with mediocre expectations at the least and was completely let down. The plot summary seemed like a great idea and could have probably made a good movie.It started out well enough. It seemed as if it was gearing up for a creepy climax with the first suicide and the appearance of the ghost site on the internet. However, this disjointed and hole-riddled plot disgorged something far worse than terror - boredom and confusion.*************************************** ************SPOILER WARNING************ ***************************************It all starts with a "forbidden room" that everyone seems to somehow know about, but doesn't exactly explain how some of the characters know about it or why. They just do. For plot's sake. The room, like many other rooms throughout this movie, is sealed in red (always red) tape. Apparently, it's to keep the ghosts sealed in the room. Why? Well, naturally you'd think it's because the ghosts want to kill the living, but if you thought that you'd be wrong.No, unfortunately, the answer to the problem is something much dumber than poltergeist haunting. The ghosts basically make human beings suffer depression because of loneliness (it never quite explains how this happens with couples or families since the focus is pretty much on the main characters and the rest of the world simply dies somehow), and because they can't resist the depression they kill themselves and/or get so depressed they turn into blackened stains on the wall or floor (depending on how they died), unable to move or escape their misery, yet somehow able to call their friends and call for help, although how they expect their friends to save them, I have no idea... I guess they don't know either.So here we are with ghosts depressing people so badly that they turn into lonely little stains calling for help. This is pretty bad. And it only gets worse from there. There just isn't much logic or common sense present in this movie. The plot, although it does tie the whole thing together in the end, still has severe plot holes, bad dialog that doesn't make sense to anyone but the writers and perhaps the depressed characters themselves (and is being said because they are depressed so depressed they simply aren't thinking straight), and pretty much no frightening scenes to speak of.The ghosts look like people you can see through and not even remotely scary or frightening people at that. They look like normal people. The reactions of the characters that see the ghosts range from absolute mind-numbing terror (where they blatantly can't think straight) to outright denial. The terror is the worst part because it simply looks like a normal person is standing over them while they freak out for no reason at all. It looks cheap and the ghosts simply aren't terrifying. What happens to the characters that all die simply doesn't evoke fear or horror at all. It lacks a lot.Go watch something better. You're not likely to really miss much here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately Asian cinema delivers much better horror movies than Hollywood, sure you have to like them as they are completely different. Maybe I didn't get 'Kairo' or maybe it's just too long, too boring and interesting idea for the movie was vested. It suppose to be scary movie, sure what scares one person will not scare everyone else, so maybe that's why 'Kairo' putted me to sleep. For me I wasn't even close to 'Shutter' or 'Ju-on: The Grudge'. Way too slow, I've been watching it on fast forward to not fall a sleep again. There can be slow movie which will keep you from falling asleep and will deliver, go and see 'Gin gwai - The Eye' or 'Ôdishon - Audition'. I'm a horror fan and I'm watching quite a lot of it, this is second time when I had problems with keeping till the end of the movie. First time was my fault; I should trust to IMDb rating and avoid 'Alone in the dark' but fondness to the game won. I'm not fan of Hollywood remakes but maybe this time it will be better than original as it's really good idea for a movie and would be pity to not make it in a good way.</fullReview>

It seems to be a movie denouncing technology as bad for us, because it steals from us the attention we should be giving to each other. Apparently, this results in the end of the world, or nearly so. I don't agree.I thought Kairo was a boring, over-long movie which made me sleepy, and which ended up not being worthwhile, because it didn't show its points clearly enough.My rating: 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's worth seeing.That said it is neither the scariest, most terrifying, or any of the other hyperbole that the young and easily impressed, posting here, would attribute to it.The first half does have a couple of very effective moments, moments of style. Nothing overt, nothing splashy, but just an unnatural moment... of dread, that if you let it... will hold you.People complain of pacing problems, of flaws, of the film feeling unfinished. They are right, the 2nd half is all of that, has all of those failings, but is captivating anyway. As the dread and horror of the 1st half dissipates, and you are left with something both less and more, an explanation that is... not horrific but... haunting. That makes you think. And those who think its about the internet, don't get it. It's no more about the internet, than Jaws was about a boat. It's about dying, and living, and what happens when both become... finite. What happens when death is not enough.I'm being cryptic. Cryptic is good when going into this movie. Go in to this movie, like you should to any movie, expecting nothing (spoiler free)and you may find in it... something... that lingers long after you see it.A concept, an idea, that is sharp, and brilliant, and not fully explored. And perhaps, that's as it should be. Perhaps the film would have folded if the battleground was anyplace but in the viewers mind.It's a very sharp, and haunting idea, that this film licks upon. And yes the ending stumbles, but not badly enough for you to really care... your mind is still toying with... possibilities.A good film, redeemed by a great concept. Superior to the directors woefully overrated CURE. Worth the viewing. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I saw this film mentioned in of those many "Scariest Movies You've Never Seen" lists that always seem to circulate around Halloween time. The plot sounded interesting, so I decided to check it out. If one had to describe a plot, it starts with a teenager who kills himself in a creepy fashion, and how his death affects his coworkers and friends. Each of this small group of young adults starts to experience strange occurrences.All of this is tied together with the emergence of a new phenomenon called the internet (remember, this was released in 2001). In a separate side story that eventually intersects with the characters mentioned in the first paragraph, a young man is excited to be installing his internet software and connecting his dial up modem for the first time, but when he finally connects, his computer seems to be a portal into rooms populated by creepy half human/ghosts. He seeks to advice of a computer science student, and together they try to figure out what is going on while being drawn further into the mystery.The film is obviously pushing in a not so subtle way a message about how technology and the internet are making us more isolated and lonely, to the point where the line between people and ghosts is blurred. Even though the message is not subtle, it is effective, and story delivers some genuinely creepy and disturbing scenes in exploring that message. As many other reviewers who are much more familiar with Japanese horror than I am have mentioned, this genre of horror is less interested in quick and instant payoffs than in gradually building a sense of dread.I deducted a couple of stars because I felt the running time could have been shaved a bit without much loss of effectiveness, and because I shared the concerns some other reviewers have mentioned about how the ending felt disconnected from the earlier parts of the film. But I'd still recommend it. Even though the internet technology displayed in this film feels extremely outdated already, the film's message is still relevant, and it left me with a lingering sense of dread and creepiness that endured even after the movie had ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Japanese ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What could have been just another RING rip-off turns out to be one of the most thought-provoking and genuinely eerie films I've seen come out of Japan: it's a film in which the door between the living and the dead is accidentally opened, leading to all manner of sinister events as it transpires that the dead are returning to Earth.Like most J-horrors of the past decade, PULSE is a slow burner that moves almost glacially, gradually slotting in the various pictures of the jigsaw as its final game plan becomes apparent. Saying too much would spoil the intriguing, dream-like narrative, suffice to say that this is a film that doesn't disappoint at any stage during its progress. The 'ghost' segments are supremely creepy and disturbing, countered neatly by shock suicide scenes and a clever bit of FX involving a plane that was later cribbed for Alex Proyas's Hollywood movie KNOWING.The cast give typically understated performances that increase in intensity as the character list is gradually whittled down, leading to one heck of a grim climax. Altogether, I can't fault the direction, writing, acting as all three combine to deliver an imaginative and thoughtful ghost story that's extremely different from most of what's come before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant plot, good screen writer... Bad director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a pretty smart story. By surreal way, the movie is telling the social problems in Japanese society. Each character is presenting different classes of people. They all are failing apart with their depressing life. It was made in the most depressing point by given the realism inside view of the young Japanese generation. PLEASE CONSIDER IT COULD BE SERIOUS SPOILERS FROM HERE!The first ones to fall in evil darkness are the weakest ones... the computer geeks, then other weak people with little social skills. The stronger ones whom are not only good looking and optimistic but also with the handsome pocket. But even them can't escape the darkness, most likely by losing the love one. Only the strongest people escaped the evil pandemic by.... abandon Japan to live oversea. LOL But with so many references and attentions, the director failed to execute the idea. Firstly, by the political points, the film shows the social issue of a capitalism but with fascism culture where the biggest heritage families and strong finance people get bigger advantages in life. Honestly there was only a positive point that he mention to bring back the car industry for Japanese workers by using the car temporarily break out. But... OH MYGOD!! for the rest of the world. The most ridiculous point that the director didn't know he is a fascist one himself. By classing the people and choosing fates for them, by using Darwin theory of only the strongest (character) ones survive. He ignores the fact of millions are dying, he might save one or two. If only one character could have been saved by the other, it may prove love and relationship are real too, not just ghost. It makes audiences feel life is cheating them when the most selfish, ignorant ones are consider the most strongest and deserving people to live. By finance point of view, it's pretty good way to show investors that Japanese society is desperately need for emotional touching moments. Art in form of motion pictures needs budget injection, otherwise we off to oversea countries. But again, he failed to impress investors whom really consider profit is always the most important part by failing reach the climax horror moments in order to please the crowd. To make it worse the quiet and seem to be distance shadow of the friendly ghosts are really laughable. The director may cry for the lack of budget, but a shocking ugly evil face with shocking big bang sound could really do the tricks. With the FX in the end of the movie when our hero left the dead city, the director can't explain after a long intense period, she unfolded the mystery by seeing her friend's body was falling to pieces and flow away ..... inside a small room. It should happened with camera followed the run of the lead actress and zoomed away through the balcony to larger view of quiet and ghostly city. It doesn't only create more art element for the movie, but it also gives the audience a relaxing moment before going to final act. Then again, it's difficult to ask this Japanese director to have fun or even the meaning of recess. Coming to nature, public &amp; charity services as solutions weren't once mentioned. And where is the family value which distinguish human being from other species? In conclusion, too much horizontal but lack of vertical directions. The director could do well in theater play but this product should had passed to some one with more Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch senses type of directors, not this visual effect out of date plus Hitchcock die hard/never grow up Manga fan director. One advice from a movie lover, Surreal only works in a realistic fashion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been two years since I saw Kairo but coming to this page again I realize how much it still lingers in my mind. First of all I'm not sure if its a horror movie, not in the classic sense anyway. It's an existential drama with a low budget and some genuinely creepy moments. If the idea of loneliness scares you then I guess it IS a horror movie, but for me it's more of an "unsettling movie" if that ever was a genre. If so, it's a genre I like. About the movie. The story starts of like any other j-horror flick with some school kids investigating a MYSTERY on the INTERNET. Imagine that... What I like with Kurosawa is his talent of taking a well known setting and turning it into something else. Basically Kairo is about the fear of loneliness and ultimately that this loneliness may carry on into eternity. The story isn't flawless and involves some out-of-place scenes, and "science" explanations, but what crowns the movie is the overall feel of it. Yes, I will remember it fondly even after another two years, and another. Also, the sound-work is amazing. Be sure to crank up those woofers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Kairo' is very self consciously in its ambitions. It tries to adapt a very old idea of ghosts to the modern reality of alienation that is so prevalent a theme in Asian horror. Which is to say that as far as the concept goes the movies had something very solid to work on. Unfortunately the execution is off. The action moves from one consistently dimly lit room to the next and an unnerving soundtrack adds to the moody atmosphere of a movie that places all of its focus on doing just that: creating an atmospheric sense of unease.With that said, there is nothing particularly scary about it. The coherence that is so obvious in the cinematography is utterly absent script-wise so that there are far too many extraneous elements that detract from the whole. 'Kairo' goes back to the staples that define J-horror as a genre, it is slow paced to a fault and has no qualms in diverting the viewer's attention with skill. All this fails to accomplish much more than create a vapid exercise of artistry that goes nowhere. Perhaps that was the entire point.There is one thing that makes 'Kairo' somewhat creepy. The sheer lack of people. It sounds odd but considering what an overcrowded metropolis Tokyo is there is something unreal in having scene after scene in which most of the protagonists are shadow people slowly headed in no direction amidst a great human emptiness. This becomes more noticeable and relevant as the movie progresses toward its climax. Driving around the streets of Tokyo without a living soul to be seen is indeed a strange thing.Overall, 'Kairo' is interesting but rather flawed. There is a jaded feeling to it that the different approach to the topic of ghosts is not enough to dispel. Perhaps its greatest problem is that it is not even particularly original within the genre. The movie is fully entrenched in a tradition and it does deviate from it. A lot of potential is mostly wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an Asian horror fan, I've always loved watching them, name Ringu and the Ju-On series as examples. Recently, I've just seen Kairo and I was... wowed! This horror movie is all about human interrelationships and its degradation through modern technology. The very reason why I loved this film because of its underlying meaning of death and loneliness. The psychological structure of the film, which goes VERY SLOOOOWWW builds up a feeling of unease and fear as revelations unveil the hidden cause of the rash of deaths or disappearances occurring around the clueless characters. After watching the movie, Kairo didn't only gave me the chills but the worrying fear of death and future. This creepiness of the story was underlined by its dark cinematography emphasizing the darkness of our lonely world . Enter the disturbing musical score, the music disturbs me deeply along with a hair-raising imagery. Add also the good performances of the actors which I could really relate into. And with the skillful direction of Kiyoshi Kurasawa (is this right?), the film shines.If you want psychological horror, dark themes and brilliant storyline, Kairo is the film to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people complain of pointless story and little development on heroes, who appear and disappear in numbers. I agree, but this reminds me that "screen-saver" with white dots, and I'm quite sure this resemblance is not coincidental.The second surprise I want to praise Kairo for is that imperceptible turn from shallow rings-class horror to apocalyptic setting.I also agree that the editing is pretty weird, but there was one scene worth forgiving those awkward transitions. Remember one ghost scene, when all background noise was suddenly cut off and those "help me" words became very clear and spooky. Fresh, simple and creative.The last thing I would like to praise Kairo for was depicting loneliness and depression by the means of showing gray concrete buildings. Although not fresh (check original Dark waters), this idea still works better for me than creating depressive mood by employing rain, which I'm personally quite tired of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off i love Asian cinema. Originality pours into they're story's and keeps reminding us all that there's still hope in film. Unfortunately these fantastic efforts get completely mistranslated these days when they get shipped abroad. Examples being The Ring, Dark Water and The Grudge. Now they've gone and done it with this classic horror tale.Kairo (Pulse) creates unbearable tension all surrounding a truly amazing concept of loneliness that relates to the afterlife. Students start getting picked off one at a time in trying to uncover the goings on of a friends suicide. He leaves a disk, part of a virus uncovering a doorway that has been unlocked to the afterlife. Ghosts that once confronted, open the eyes of those that meet them into the horrible realisation that after life.....you become trapped within the pain of being alone, thus being killed by your own sorrow.Kairo is an extremely dark and creepy film that is supported by fantastic visuals and a very downbeat music score. It has no full on gore, which is what you'd expect when watching the classic Asian horror films these days, indeed most of the torment is created by the things we don't see, so an open imagination helps aid the enjoyment of this film.I have to admit i had to watch the film a good three times to fully follow the story. So please make sure when watching this movie that it has your full attention.If you enjoyed Ju-On The Grudge then you will enjoy this. I haven't yet nor care to see the remake yet, tho judging by the poor reviews its getting already i don't think I'm missing out much! Great Movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I choose to watch it because i really appreciated Koyuki in "last samurai". So i expected to find again her delicate, sweet behavior. For that, it's true that she was the same here. In addition, Japan is a country that has always intrigued me with its spectacular symbiosis of technology and tradition. So as my first Japanese movie reviewed at IMDb, it has the flavor of a ethnology search as well: discover the country, how people live: Again, the movie is good for that: I could see that Japan is an ultra clean country compared to France and that people is very calm compared to my loud compatriots! Next, the movie has an historic value as well: it's about the Web when it was still a baby (modem, a lot of Windows) and offers a judicious analysis of what it becomes: a dehumanizing tool! The more you are connected, the more you lose human touch! Despite all this good stuff, i admit that i stopped watching after one hour: the dialogs are pretty awful, my version was dreadful (dark, no vivid color) and the directing isn't great: the supernatural is very, very slow and absolutely not clear! Finally, i couldn't recognize the characters, the places and i cut the watching. So far, my TV screen hasn't switch back on :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of my top 10 horror movies and is unique and original in various ways. This movie makes use of the technique of isolation, shadows, blurred images to cause the scares. This movie is well paced and entertaining. However, don't expect things such as the ghost coming out of the computer or the characters in the movie being sucked into the computer. There wasn't such scares. In fact shadows(visions) of dead friends would be shown in the computer, and there is one really frightening screen saver. The usage of possession in this movie was very unique. Don't expect the possession technique to be like Bunshinsaba and Phone, which the girl gets possessed ends up killing others or treating others differently. This show uses the possession technique such that the person who gets possessed ends up wanting to kill himself and die. They feel very lonely and become shadows and then paintings on the wall and vanishes into thin air. The flaws in this movie includes this movie taking place mainly in the morning( I prefer some of the scares to take place at night) Tension and fear of this movie does not take place evenly.(i.e. The scariest scenes in this movie mainly take place in the middle but not towards the end.) The ending was a very sweet one. This movie is highly recommended. It is unique and entertaining. Score: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of Japanese horror movies, from psychological to schlocky-splatter films, I had a lot of movies on my list to watch before I ever got to Kairo. I wish now I would have watched it sooner. I was very pleasantly surprised. If you're reading this review, you probably have a grasp of what many Japanese horror movies are like by now. Honestly, not knowing much about it or director Kurosawa, I assumed it would probably be a cryptic, hair-in-face vengeful ghost story.That was NOT the case. I was thoroughly engulfed in the story, and the many questions it raises. It takes a while to get moving, but in my opinion the buildup is part of the emotional reward of the movie. This isn't just another "ghost coming out of cursed (insert plot device here.)" I would honestly compare this movie more to Suicide Circle (Suicide Club) than Ju-on or Ring, minus the gore of SC. That being said, if you have seen some Japanese horror movies and liked them, you will love this movie. If you're the kind of person who watches anything and says "This sucks. I'm not scared/you're an idiot/wuss/etc," don't watch it. It's that simple. Complain about American horror remakes, not the originals. IF you don't like foreign horror movies because you find them hard to follow (which I admit they sometimes are,) don't watch it. Be content to watch another "reboot" of something from twenty years ago. I loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Asian horror, I had bought this movie before the American re-make. I was pleasantly scared to the bone by this chiller. Everyone I introduced to this movie found it difficult to watch, because although the gore is toned down, the spookiness is turned up. When i discovered an American re-make was coming out, my first reaction was, "you can't re-make perfection." Just in case I was wrong, I eventually watched the American version and was as disappointed as I thought I would be. So far in the Asian movie re-makes I have yet to see a movie that is as compelling in a thriller or a horror as the Asian version. The real obsessive movie fans will have the Asian films in their collection, not the English copycats. Pulse is an excellent movie if watched in it's true language with subtitles, in the original version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be very creepy and quite frightening in places. The pacing is maddeningly slow at times, but it unfolds in its own purposeful way. The Asians have a knack for using contrast in film. The fright scenes here come from nowhere and vanish before we are even sure what we've experienced. It is truly a gifted film maker who can create such an instantly frightening circumstance. As we saw in Ringu and other genre pictures (The Eye) for instance, there is a real obsession with fear through movement. There is something so unnatural about the way we see the entities creep around on screen; the power of image is difficult to overstate.The acting is great, although the dialog is sparse (as are the set pieces). This is a movie concerned primarily with atmosphere. The dark beauty of some of the scenes (the tower jump, the air plane crash)juxtaposed against their horrible consequences is very artistic.What might be truly most frightening about this piece, however, is the notion that perhaps the dead are NOT happy where they are. If there was a way back for them, how would we react? It's a great piece of original horror. See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Japanese ghost story "Pulse" provides us with an intriguing premise that is only sporadically well executed. A kind of "Carnival of Souls" for the cyber generation, the film revolves around restless spirits who have figured out a way to use personal computers as portals back into the real world.Unfortunately, due to the restraints placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the visuals are often as murky as the storyline. Much of the time we can't tell what is going on, partly because the picture is so grainy, and partly because the screenplay itself is so muddled. Characters come and go and we have no idea who they are or what indeed is happening to them. There are, admittedly, some creepy, otherworldly moments in the film, but they are undercut by the desultory pacing and the overall lack of clarity. Valiantly, the filmmakers have thrown in a few existentialist comments about the pointlessness and loneliness of existence, but they aren't nearly sufficient to help the movie overcome its many weaknesses.An admirable failure, "Pulse" at least earns points for trying - but not for succeeding in its endeavor.</fullReview>

The movie just really dragged. (and I am a big fan of Asian horror and am quite used the the difference in pacing overseas). There were some really horrifying moments in this movie... and some really original ideas. But... it just never comes together ... at all. This movie felt like a dream that I couldn't wake up from. Maybe thats kinda what they were going for. And actually... i liked that feeling. But. Still.... To any horror movie buff who is looking for something new to check out... this movie IS worth seeing. Just don't expect the next Ju-On or The Shining.Its really....convoluted. And... tedious. But. Still decent. Better than Dark Water. And more creative than anything to come out of Hollywood in the past few years.6.8/10 ... yeah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I added this to my netflix flist hoping to see a genuinely scary Japanese horror film. It'd been a while since I'd been properly frightened by a film so when I saw the rave reviews, I decided to check it out.Honestly I can't say this film should be categorized as horror. It wasn't remotely frightening to me in the least and if anything, "Pulse" was depressing and long (one of my friends actually fell asleep several times during the movie and she's one of those easy to scare types). I also feel like they could have cut out a lot of the little scenes where the characters were just existing in whatever morose or pensive state they were in.The camera angles in the first thirty minutes or so of the movie kinda bugged me as well. I felt like I was watching some amateur camera action of people sitting around chatting. There were no proper close ups... honestly to the point where I didn't really know what the characters looked like until they started dying off. ...or perhaps the camera angles were supposed to be metaphorical and I just didn't get it.Ultimately, "Pulse" IMO is more or less an apocalyptic, depressing documentary of human loneliness that just wasn't my cup of tea. Not a bad movie necessarily but not certainly not the "best damn horror movie" of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Exploration of the Horror Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Kairo' is a film for the ages - K. Kurosawa's interpretation of the technological world and the horrors it brings. Set in the same vein as the classic novels 'Frankenstein' and 'Brave New World,' the film explores the destruction of personal human relationships and our fall from nature via technological progress in society. Anyone who claims 'Kairo' is just a confusing horror movie should go back to watching 'Freddy vs Jason'.Kiyoshi Kurosawa uses common horror clichés and scenes which I can describe as exploiting "sustained terror" to expose the truly horrific elements of story. Although some people may criticize K. Kurosawa for going for the big scare at times, he does so to emphasize what the audience should actually be scared of - separation and the loss of primal human relationships.The horror genre has become jaded by big box American slasher films, and it's great to see new ideas enter the field, such as those coming out of 'Kairo.' This film truly deserves 10 stars - not only is the film a great scare right after you see it, the horror of its meaning stays with you for a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kairo is definitely a movie that you will either love or hate. I did neither. The atmosphere is very dark and brooding so if you get caught up in the feel of the movie you will love every minute of it. Kairo is a thrilling ride to the end of the world and I had trouble expressing my excitement. This movie is definitely theme based, leaving plot and reason behind in the dust. Leave your sense of reality behind as it will only serve to trip you up when trying to understand things such how ghosts traverse the internet.Its time to hit the fear department, after all this is a horror movie right? As I watched this movie I couldnt help but wait for the next monkey dance to make me p*** my pants. With the unmoving camera shots and creeping shadows, an observant viewer will find many subtle images and movements that add to suspense. Anyone scared looking away from the screen or bored sleeping will miss many of this fine details. For me, it would probably take a couple of viewings for me catch all these subtleties.There have been a lot of issues on whether more "western" viewers would be able to handle such a film. The truth is that this movie is quite anti-hollywood in its pace and spiritual themes. Even if someone were to somehow not like this movie, at least it would have been a new movie experience. Unless of course they had already seen other japanese horror movies such as ringu, dark water, etc. In that case, at least this film strives to reach a higher level; a level high enough to make anyone not completely immersed into its ideology lost in a maze of confusion and apathy. Such ambiguity deserves praise from the most indifferent audience and definitely earns its place in my list of best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could swear the dvd package said it was made in 1997. The internet was not the same thing back then that it was by 2001, and it's still not the same thing in every society (and within societies - just one example I remember an article about surprising numbers of people who say they've "given up on" the internet, and that was like mid-2002 or something in Canada). If you have subtitles, notice how much of the computer terminology is recognizable as borrowed English words, which means that they're foreign words for the people in this film. But why would it be about technology anyway?Very primal, the fears. She always thought she would be alone no matter what and now she knows. What's in there that makes people break down? And whose/what's point of view is that camera(?) on the wall anyway? "I'm not alone"?People so lonely, so already un-existing that you can hardly tell them from the walls around them. This film needs to be absorbed slowly. Subtlety. Were you expecting a guy with a knife or something? No. It's existential fear. And if you let it, it can unsettle you, and I don't blame you if you don't even try to let it do that. It might not be fun.The computer program btw reminds me of another film, haven't found the title, something like "P-1". Random monochrome splotches eventually form what looks like computer code, and when run as a program it seems to have a mind of its own...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiyoshi Kurosawa is certainly one of Japan's best current directors. His directorial fingers are impeccable. Unfortunately, as a screenwriter, I think he's hit or miss. This is my sixth Kurosawa film, and that makes exactly half I loved, exactly half I disliked or was largely indifferent toward. Cure, Charisma and Bright Future are brilliant films in both mind and body. Seance, Doppelganger and Pulse all bored me to a certain extent. Pulse is great in its technical senses. The cinematography and the sound editing are both pretty impressive. But the script is just poor. It's no surprise that this mediocre film is the one Kurosawa film that has been chosen for an American remake. I wonder if the director purposely sold out with it. It's a pretty standard J-horror plot (ghosts start appearing on the internet), and it seems geared toward teenagers. The effect is only slightly better than a Hideo Nagata movie (IMO, he's the biggest hack working in Japan right now). The characters act like complete morons and the dialogue is often horrendous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this at Lincoln Center's Walter Reade Cinema in New York, and at the time I remember hearing that it would be one of the last US showings because the rights were bought for a US version of the film, for which part of the deal meant no more US shows of the original Japanese version. Sad, sad. There's absolutely no way this could be done better by a US filmmaker, as the terror derives directly from the coldness (as perceived by Americans) that is so much a part of Japanese culture. In Japan, this is a simple story of a slow disinterest in life's banality. In the US, it would be an end-of-the-world ghost story. Somehow the manner in which Kurosawa hints at the end-of-the-world resonates as a metaphor for all of us, and I was both frightened during the film and then even more depressed afterward. Really, a masterful achievement. A friend and I disagree as to the effectiveness of the ending (he likes it more than I), but it's still powerful all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a let down......what's with all the hype???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie because every review I read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. I really don't understand what all of the hype was about. For one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad ("What if something strange is going on?"...what????). The acting didn't blow my socks off either. It could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and I didn't give a hoot about them at all. Another thing is that the movie extremely boring. Extremely. Sure, there are a couple of "jolts" here and there, but for the movie's 112 minute length, it sure didn't use it's time up wisely. Most of the movie contains characters talking about stuff that had barely anything to do with the plot. What was the point of that??To top it off, the movie makes no sense. Yes, I believe I understood the intentions of the ghosts, but how that fits into the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me. Also, much of the movie is played out in little vignettes, which makes the story hard to follow at times. And don't even get me started with the ending. What exactly happened there?I can give Kurosawa credit for placing some truly frightening images throughout the film. There are very creepy shots of ghosts and other unsettling images. If they reflected more on those images and elaborated on them, it would have made the movie much stronger. But they didn't, and instead elaborated more on social commentary, which was interesting, but again, portrayed in an extremely dull way. Yes, it's a message movie. Okay, fun. I'll just get the message of my review right out here in the open: find a better way to spend your spare time than watching this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is ambiguity and then there is poor writing. I'm afraid this film suffers from an awful lot of the latter. I've given a few stars for mood (LOTS of mood) and some nice cinematography. I'm afraid, as is the case with many modern Japanese films, especially comedies and horror films, this one could have used a bit of judicious editing. As films often (sometimes unintentionally) speak for cultures, I'm a little worried about what's going on over there. Then again, if I had to live in some of the same grim flats that the characters do, I'd probably throw myself off the roof as well. See the Robert Wise version of THE HAUNTING (1963), THE INNOCENTS or Kobayashi's KWAIDAN if you want well written, well acted, moody and truly frightening films.</fullReview>

There's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world: it involves the internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious grad student, withdrawn behavior, red rooms, dark stains, and _then_ suicides. Good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely. Characters are barely sketched, which could be OK, but they're completely uninteresting. It's far too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is nonsensical. Weakest moment: when "the boss" sits down to give some incoherent advice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can totally see why Pulse bores the hell out of some people! It moves at a very slow pace, and if ghost stories do nothing for you then you'll most certainly nod off. Also, if you're like my family and you demand an ugly decapitation every ten minutes, then you aren't going to be wanting to watch this. However, ghost films do do it for me. I find them extremely creepy and Pulse proves itself to be one of the creepiest I've seen. It all comes down to what scares you. I rarely get scared. The last film to properly scare me was Noroi: The Curse, however a couple of scenes in Pulse scared the Jesus out of me! I have just two words... Wobbly ghost.To me Noroi: The Curse is a masterclass in how to scare your audience. It filled me with fear, and its ending is a real gut-puncher. Whilst Pulse doesn't quite make itself quite as scary (nor as good) as Noroi, it is still one of the creepiest films I've seen in a long time. It's pretty essential that you watch this on your own, in the dark, with the sound turned up (there's some great use of sound and music) in order to get the full chilling experience. The wobbly ghost scene is one of the scariest things I've seen in my life! I can't explain it, but it gave me chills and I had to look away! Something about the movement was so unnatural and unnerving, I was thinking that I was going to be in for one hell of a ride! Unfortunately however, because this scene happens reasonably early on, there is only one other scene that almost matches its sheer scariness.Don't get me wrong, Pulse features a string of supremely creepy scenes. It's unlike anything I've seen before in the ghost department as its slow pace builds up a wonderfully eerie atmosphere (I can't see the American remake being any where near as masterful as this!) and some scenes are full of choking suspense, such as when the man first gets contact from the website. My only problem with the film is that it lacked character development, and I would've liked to have gotten to know the characters better. Also, the plot sometimes doesn't make much sense (I don't understand the majority of the third act) and the characters have strange reactions e.g. A woman see someone committing suicide but then it's never mentioned again. The whole apocalyptic element is also not fully explained, however I admired its ambition.But Pulse is really about its creepy atmosphere and that's what it succeeds in doing. It's the type of film that places its disturbing images under your brain and stays there. I never get scared, and it's refreshing to actually feel terrified at what I'm watching. I didn't find Pulse boring, although some scenes did drag it was never boring. I just found it a little confusing. Nevertheless, Pulse is one of the best ghost films I've seen. It relies on its stupendous atmosphere and seriously creepy moments. One scene towards the end, nearly scared me as much as the wobbly ghost! Pulse has the ability to send shivers down your spine and have your hair stand on end, which certainly makes it something special in my eyes! However, I was slightly disappointed that that terrifying face on the poster wasn't in it!</fullReview>

The filming is flawless, perfect colors, Kurosawa describes calmly how at the end of summer, human race began to slowly vanish from the surface of the earth. There's no fancy effects during the scenes showing the ghosts, the actors emotions are rare and deep. the scary moments are based on non aggressive monsters, who are disturbing because they looks like humans but are in fact remnants of their own entity trapped into "eternal isolation", and all this is filmed with the magnificent descriptive/pessimistic Kurosawa style.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't be fooled people. Even though this movie starts off like your basically standard Japanese horror movie featuring ghosts, the movie is actually much more than that. This only starts to become apparent in the movie its second halve and it was quite a big and pleasant surprise really.It's quite a deep film that features symbolism and metaphors. It's probably a movie that you should definitely watch more than once, to try and catch new things within in the movie and understand some of it better. It's a quite hard and complicated movie to watch, largely due to the movie its second halve but it's an ultimately very rewarding one, even though you won't understand all of it.Even though it may not be your average mainstream Japanse horror flick, it's still a movie that features this distinctive kind of atmosphere, build-up and tension. It's still a pretty creepy to watch therefore, despite all of its deeper intentions. I would still therefore call this movie an horror, though some people seem kind of reluctant to do so. It still is kind of hard to describe this movie and to put it under one label. The movie mixes different kind of styles with its story and approach and you therefore don't really need to be into Japanese horror to appreciate this Kiyoshi Kurosawa film.A great pleasant surprise!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow burning horror parable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this last night for the second time, and like the first was hugely impressed. The story, like much Asian horror these days (not all of course but a goodly amount) concerns ghosts and technology, but whilst Ring, Phone, Into The Mirror and the like mostly resolve into fairly traditional stories involving curses or revenge, Kairo has no such simplicity. In fact, even on a second viewing I'm not entirely sure how everything fits together. However, for me Kairo is hardly a horror film so much as a meditation on loneliness and mans isolation from one another in todays technological, industrial society. There is an explanation put forward and though this gives a general guiding principle for what is going on, I certainly couldn't quite figure everything out. I wouldn't say this hurts the film though, for, paying attention to the dialogue, it seems as though the film is deliberately throwing up more questions and possibilities than it answers. I just read a few discussion threads which give different ideas as to the film, but whilst the themes are, I think pretty clear, I can't tell personally whether the plot is even supposed to hang together in a manner that can be straightforwardly explained. In my opinion, the events, the dialogues and the themes weave together into less of a rational object and more a purposefully difficult, even inscrutable philosophical fear piece, designed to provoke thought and leave the viewer scratching their head afterwards. In a way, it seems designed to work against the horrors of loneliness contained within because this is a perfect movie to sit down to with deep thinking inclined buddies and then puzzle out at the end, thus making exactly the kind of connections that stave off loneliness, if only for a while. Intellectualisation aside, Kiyoshi Kurosawa is a masterful director, conjuring real chilling scenes from now over familiar tropes such as shadowy ghosts and technology playing up and he is helped by the fine cast, who make everything seem remarkably plausible, and react in a relatively understandable way to the events, rather than the characters in a lot of these films who seem at times unduly stoical. There is an chilling, nihilistic atmosphere and Kurosawa composes scenes and images in such a way that the life truly seems to drain away from the picture and be replaced by sad, beautiful loneliness. One way in which this is achieved is in the contrast between earlier scenes amongst the plants and the move into desolate industrial locations. All in all, I think this is really haunting, magnificent stuff. Some will undoubtedly find it silly, or boring, or incomprehensible, and also, no doubt some will have understood the plot perfectly. Personally I think this by some way the best of all the Asian ghost pictures and recommend it highly, especially to the philosophically minded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Pulse (Kairo) (2001)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've chanced upon this DVD at the Esplanade Library, and thought that it would be essential viewing before the Hollywood remake descends upon us in September. While the remake's trailer seemed scary enough with its freaky ghouls, I was apprehensive how spooked I will get when watching the original from writer director Kiyoshi Kurosawa.And surprise, I found it to be palatable. and it confirms one thing though about the limited J- Horror movies that I've seen. There is minimal in-your-face shock-and-awe tactics. In Kairo, the mood and atmosphere is extremely measured with its superb controlled use of light and shadow. Expect things to go bump in the dark, but not too often though.I believe what makes J-Horror movies a spookfest, is its ability to weave freaky stories from seemingly everyday events and objects. The Ring has its VCR tape and television set, while here, it's the Internet, a website which asks if you would like to meet a ghost, and a computer's ability to dial up on its own. From the start you're presented with a mysterious suicide, before the movie progresses with people in the city disappearing for no apparent reason, and vague happenings with shadows and black stains at spots where people die.The ideas presented here, on loneliness and that human connection, seem interesting enough to ponder upon, as it questions if the use of technological tools like the computer brings people together, or further isolates us from one another. It also tried to ask a hypothetical what-if question, of what would happen if the other region which ghosts belong to, would be finitely occupied by the spirits, and their numbers start to spill over to our realm.Most of the time, nothing really happens in the movie, which might seem a bore to those weaned on jump scares, quick cuts and actual ghouls and goblins making an appearance to scare the wits out of the leads. I liked the shot where the car roams around an empty streets of Japan, kinda reminds me of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, or even cheesy fests such as Resident Evil.While I thought it was not scary, my friend warned me about the after effects, which I've yet to experience, not until the sun sets at least. And heck, I'm using the internet right now to write this too. Hope the screen doesn't go freaky on me...Code 1 DVD comes with the theatrical trailer, which seems scary enough on its own, and a 41 minute long making-of documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film shows how Japanese people can be really good at doing something. If you like dark colors and mood, shadows of doubt and expectation, this movie is for you. If you like The Machinist and The Ring, you will probably like this one, as well. An important trait of this horror movie is its closeness to reality. What I mean by this... First, small but important elements from the real world are introduced (such as the exact modem sounds) which puts you closer to the center of actions. Second, Kairo doesn't set a clear way of evolving, there is a little element of randomness, which makes it great, because things out there, in the real world, are like that - anything can happen, it doesn't need your understanding nor any justification to exist. The 'unknown is scary' formula is greatly used here - dusky ghosts, blurs on the walls, accompanied by appropriate background. Only few horror movies can cause me troubles falling asleep and this one was among them. Good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this film after just after watching the Eye, another foreign horror movie which is great by the way. I think it was ok, the effects were good and the whole film had a sense of dread and general creepiness about it, maybe I am just too dumb to understand this film, but it seemed to go from a generally scary film to a strange look at the afterlife. I didn't understand a few parts of it which were never really explained , but i think that on the whole it was very enjoyable and far better than anything made in America which is all terrible. I'm glad people are looking to other countries for films as we shouldn't have to see the same repetitive rubbish all the time ghost ship anyone?.I have just ordered Dark Waters so fingers crossed for that also.7 / 10</fullReview>

The script is good and moves the story along quite well. When you have ghosts coming through the Internet in order to invade our world, you have an imaginative and far-fetched story. The visuals are fascinating and hold your attention throughout. I just don't believe that the parts make a satisfying whole in this film.

		<shortDescription>A Japanese Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Japanese are doing marvelous things with horror movies these days; their weakest genre entries make Scream look like Teletubbies. As to whether or not this falls into that category is up the the tolerance of the viewer.There are two plots in this one. The first: a group of coworkers try to sort out the suicide of their programmer friend. The second: a lonely college student plugs into the internet for the first time, and finds there are scarier things online than fat chick porn. What both groups find out before they come together at the end is that, yes, there are such things as ghosts, they are online, and you won't like what they want to show you. So much so, it may drive you to suicide. Spooky!!Essentially an allegory on the alienation caused by technological convenience (email, internet, cell phones, etc), this movie will drive some people nuts. I had to put some serious thought into this movie to figure out what the hell was going on (the rooms taped off by red duct tape will really confuse you). There are enough creepy moments to keep your interest, but you will have to learn to appreciate the very deliberate pacing of Asian cinema to make it all the way to the end. Even then, you may still be scratching your head (and on the brink of suicide). Recommended for Asian horror fans, and parents who want to scare their kids off the Web.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing but praise for a refreshingly scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the DVD cover I expected this to be a weak version of the spooky Ring series but in viewing I realised just how amazing this film is. The basics of the story concern a website that asks "Do you want to meet a ghost?". After meeting this ghost the individual realises how utterly alone they are in the world and views suicide as an escape. (Sound of Music this isnt!) There's a lot more to the film than this but I dont want to spoil any of its many surprises. This movie oozes style and its use of CGI effects in everyday environments is flawless. Most of the supernatural action takes place in the background so you are constantly on edge looking out for more ghostly apparitions and suicide attempts. The only down side is that sometimes the jump in story between groups of characters can get a little confusing. Personally I enjoyed this as it forces you to pay attention. This is definately not a popcorn movie so be prepared to put in some work and you will find a dark and scary movie that paints an apocalyptic vision of the afterlife and our short time here in the flesh. NICE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Kairo, or "Pulse", has a terrific concept, but sadly does very little with it, wasting precious running time in a more then timid, and rather confused manner, evoking boredom more then anything else.The movie lacks tension, and the script is just terrible, missing moments of character development and relationship or dialog that should have helped mold the plot, instead stagnates with indecision. The movie has some nice effects, and the characters aren't reproachable, I just didn't feel anything from the film but casual disinterest.If an immersing, gripping, Asian ghost story is what you crave, consider Dark Water, The Eye, Shutter, A Tale of Two Sisters, Ghost House, Ringu, Ring 0, or even the American remake of 'The Ring'. Kairo simply lacked one thing: a pulse.This is one movie where a remake could actually prove helpful, and I rarely encourage remakes if ever. I will still be incredibly upset if they destroy A Tale of Two Sisters or Oldboy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kairo: Working on similar principles as the 1909 E.M. Forster short story "The Machine Stops", this early fable also centres on the concept of isolation and loneliness that can be brought about by the dependence of the mechanical over the psychical.Such as Kairo, written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, brings forward the message of overuse of modern technology and its possible additive side effects, such as social inertia, this has in its own rights devastating results. With the all too familiar indifference that this technology can bring, the Human Soul slowly implodes, as the Spirit forgets or just gives up the fight, to interact, to live, the Heartbeat, the Kairo of the Soul dies.This is done in a very tasteful and somewhat frightening manner, with the Souls of the dead, or just victims of their own segregation? Coming back to haunt the living, to forewarn or to plead a cry for help? Kiyoshi Kurosawa has done an excellent job here of using the medium of technology to portray a line that has been crossed over by the disenchanted and their past lives. The result is a dark truth that all is not well within the World that they inhabit, they are slowly committing social suicide. Then the cry of a million lonely Souls are heard, trying desperately to reach out and maintain the Human contact that they have lost.There are scenes here that will have your heart jumping, and your pulse racing; the supernatural method of realisation and the coming consequence of the Worlds independence of this technology is a daunting reminder of our own suicide.Having Kiyoshi Kurosawa win the 2001 José Luis Guarner Critic's Award at the Catalonian International Film Festival, Sitges in Spain, and nominated for Best Film too. 2002 was a good year for Kiyoshi Kurosawa also; for the Japanese Professional Movie Awards had Kumiko Aso, who plays Michi Kudo, win the Award for Best Actress.After The Machine, all there is left is you?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allegorical horror film (mild spoiler contained)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am far from an expert in cinema or Japanese culture, but I think this film should be viewed, in part, as an allegory about the demographic crisis in modern day Japan. Japan is a nation with an aging and shrinking population, because their birth rate is too low and they discourage immigration. The Japanese work very hard and are very technologically advanced, yet not enough people are getting married and having enough children, Japanese culture and society and economic power may fade away in the future. I think the film may be alluding to this.Notice that in this movie there are NO children. Nobody is married. Nobody is having children. All the characters are young single adults. There are not even any parents (one character very briefly calls her mother; that is the sole reference in the entire film to the existence of parents, children, or families!) In the movie, the characters are disappearing and the connections they try to make with each other do not prevent more of them from disappearing . . . eventually leading to an apocalyptic vision of everyone disappearing in Japan. The survivors at the end are fleeing by boat -- to where? to Latin America of all places, where they've heard there are signs of life. Not coincidentally, me thinks, Latin America is a continent with a very high birth rate.Anyway, that's my theory and I'm stickin' to it.Overall, I think the movie is more than a bit muddled. And at least when viewing it on video, the dark lighting and action on screens within screens (i.e., within my TV screen is a room and within that room is a computer screen, and within that computer screen are ghosts) make it hard to follow at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very special film. New heights in the horror genre have certainly been reached in this little affair. This just happened to be on TV one night - a Japanese movie something about the Internet and ghosts - I decided to watch it. *SPOILERS* Things are very obscure right from the opening and you don't really know what's going on only that something very dark and terrible is beginning to unfold. Before you know it, there's a scene in a dark corridor where a young man sees from the shadows a dark ghostly figure of what looks like a woman slowly coming towards him, with the choice of sound effects used in this short scene along with 'the fear of the unknown' this really makes for one of the most terrifying moments in any movie I can remember. For had it been a vampire in that corridor or a red eyed growling mutated beast drooling saliva , Satan himself even, it certainly wouldn't have sent those chills through as we've all dealt with that sort many times before. The director really hit the mark, slowly dragging you in, managing to keep you in the dark, keeping you guessing wanting answers, supplying you with moments of supernatural terror to the eventual end of a society. There are many great moments in this show to haunt you long after. True brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Kairo" is one of those movies that, like the films of David Fincher,Jeunet &amp; Caro, or even Kurosawa's own "Cure," succeeds in fullyencompassing the viewer in the world of the film. In other words,the atmosphere is vivid, and gets under your skin.However, unlike Kurosawa's elliptical, enigmatic "Cure," "Kairo"fails in its plot implausibilities. It is only when Kurosawa attemptsto explain the existence of the film's Internet-transmitted ghoststhat the film falls apart. Now, perhaps something is lost in thetranslation - some subtlety or linguistic schema. However, all thesame, it is maddeningly implausible.That aside, the atmosphere is still sumptuous. Who could resistthe film's apocalyptic finale? Or the ominous "forbidden rooms"oozing with shadow, decay and, ultimately, anticpation of theunknown.Another note - Kurosawa's blend of horror is especially enticing tofans of Kubrick, Godard and Antonioni. Maybe it's the coollydetached characters and the overbearingly sparse settings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kairo via Lain and Koumiko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it about Japanese and video displays? Evil Dead. The Ring series. Ka?ro. Not to mention Perfect Blue and Serial Experiments: Lain. I just saw a lesser film, Tomie, and was a little startled to see not one such display, though Tomie's eye peeking out of the bag looks like the poster art for Ringu. Long before I'd heard of Ka?ro, I decided Lain flows with the syntax of a horror film. Cyber horror. Internet horror. The "key" to Ka?ro is spoken by a grad student in a library near the film's center. Something about the place dead go finally reaching capacity, so spilling over: someone goes, someone long gone springs back, frightening someone else to death, crowding back yet another spectre in a outwardly spiraling vicious circle. The explicitness of this explanation, tells me it's not what the film is about. If you're going to write a poem about love, don't use the word. If you see the word "sea" in a true poet's poem, look elsewhere for its meaning. Kiyoshi Kurosawa's no less true a poet than Tarkovsky who he resembles in everything since Cure, or Godard who he resembled in the couple of yakuza films I was able to catch. There's no God, and no gods in Ka?ro (though Koji Yakusho in his two appearances comes close). These people are utterly alone, save for each other. Whatever this film means, or wants to say, is in the choreography, the shadows and those screens, the pace. When these kids (Are there any true adults, over-thirties, on the mainland?) stray again and again into the dark, it's not the horror film cliché. You'd almost think they're drawn to the throngs on the other side. But that's too simple. Try this: Chris Marker's 1965 Le myst?re koumiko, about an alienated Japanese woman's return to throngs. Maybe not, or...I don't know. I was going to talk about Lain. Let me just hint briefly, that Lain is full of gods, yet Lain and Ka?ro may be a pair.There's a reason you may wait a long time to see this. A propeller plane, not a jet. A low factory structure, not a skyscraper. First time round, ebay innocent, I got a video dub such a joke that I gave it away unwatched. Just to see the region 3 Ka?ro, I bought an all region DVD player, and it was worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome and Japanese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Ka?ro scheduled for the Sitges Cinema Festival it was presented as another Ringu, another Japanese terror movie (I don't mean I didn't like Ringu, It was great, but the following copies it had were... "no so good"), with floppy disks instead of video tapes. However, I was wrong, it had nothing to do with it.We were just 50 people or even less watching the movie (and I have to say that at least 20 left the cinema during the movie), so I didn't have much trouble trying to read the subtitles as the film wasn't dubbed at all (THANK GOD, you can't imagine how much takeshi kitano films loose dubbed into Spanish). The movie started and for the first fifteen minutes, the film seemed to be some kind of soft Ringu, but after that, the movie turned into a great feelings experience, a surrealist world full of spirits or I'd better say, empty of life.The film focus in the experiences of the young main characters, their feelings, their fears, their reactions. The problem is (and that's why such amount of people left the theater) that the feelings showed and the characters relationships may be too Japanese for the western public. So you have to be quite open-minded, and know the Japanese society quite a bit, to really enjoy this film.Kiyoshi Kurosawa has learned how to do good movies very quickly, in almost 15 years has become one of the bests movie directors in Japan. In Ka?ro he shows how hard he has worked in the relationships, and deep feelings of the Japanese people, into their fears and hopes. He knows how to make an awesome tragic opera from what seemed a common Japanese terror film.In conclusion, if you want something new, fresh, and EASTERN, watch Ka?ro (Pulse). However if you don't have any interest in Japanese people, their culture, their society, but want to enjoy a really terrifying movie, rent Ringu (The Ring) instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Great Film By Kiyoshi Kurosawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike many other modern filmmakers, Kiyoshi Kurosawa is able to put the sense of dread up on the movie screen like no one I've ever seen before. Like some of his other films, most noticeably Kyua (Cure) and Karisuma (Charisma) Kurosawa is able to convey a sense that the apocalypse is near. And his latest film, Kairo, he does just the same and even moves beyond us the end.Kairo is a film like no other. It's almost a reflection of our modern society in which we, as a society, have too much reliance on technology. Similar in vein to the anime series, Serial Experiments: Lain, Kairo tells the story of a group of young people and what befalls them as beings from the other side of existence (ghosts, maybe?) connect to them via the computer, cell phones, and television. Young people commit suicide leaving behind an ashen shadow where they killed themselves; strange images appear on computer screens, a dark figure roams the university library, and many more strange things happen in the course of the film. All of them adding up to a surprisingly good movie that starts out like a typical ghost thriller and evolving into something else that transcends any genre before it.This film couldn't be done anyway other then the way Kurosawa has done it. Kurosawa has a style all his own: he's able to take a normal genre of film and turn it on its side and make something totally unique out of it. Each film both thought provoking and entertaining at the same time.Pulse is equal parts brilliant filmmaking, atmosphere, and the end of the world all wrapped into one. If this film is playing anywhere near you, please see it, it was the best film of 2001, that nobody saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow burning chiller with great ghosts and a cool storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I must say of Pulse is it's one of the most effectively chilling movies I've seen. It isn't 'scary' scary as such, but it's written and directed in a fashion that keeps you thinking about all the ins and outs of the film in your head afterwards...and those ins and outs be crazy...In a similar fashion to the Pang Brother's original Eye, Pulse is actually in reverse to most horror movies, as most of the scary horrible scenes come in the first hour. Without ever throwing anything you could call a jump at you Pulse is downright terrifying, especially in this first hour. All the scares are those horrible slow-burn Shiningesque scares the Japanese do so well. After this movie I guarantee you'll find yourself staring intently at any dark corner you have in your house, and if you ever see a door taped up with red duck tape you'll run like hell. This movie, it's a chiller for sure. No big guys with axes, no blood spilt but after this I would gladly sit in front of the whole Halloween series back to back without even flinching.Still, if you're one of the 5% of society who don't find the unknown, ghosts and such and freaky women walking out of step out of the darkness while the soundtrack makes gurgling sounds just a little wrong, Pulse is different to many Horror flicks in that it has a strong plot with an original premise. The idea of Pulse is that the afterlife is full, and spirits are kind of bouncing off the walls in there looking for a conduit out. Because of the loneliness of Japanese society suicide is on the rise, and in Japanese mysticism if you kill yourself, you die without a soul, leaving a space for a spirit to pass into the real world. So towards the start of the movie, the spirits, who have managed to get as far as 'forbidden rooms' areas where the two planes cross over, and are willing those they contact to kill themselves so they can cross over. However, a side effect of the contact is that the contactee becomes even more lonely, and eventually whether they kill themselves or not, passes out of existence, making the spirit's transition even easier. I won't spoil the second half but I will go as far as to say this makes for a really interesting twist in the tale.OK, I've begun to ramble. I just love the story in this, it's such a cool idea. The effects team must be praised, as the hauntings are damn scary and truly original looking. One haunting is quite similar to Ringu, but given that's the movie that launched this genre I'll let Pulse off.So, I think this is a really good chiller. I recommend you see this before Hollywood remake it (as even if it's a decent film it will probably focus on jumps and ghosts, and probably jettison the plot entirely) though if you're in the US you'll have trouble as the contract for the remake effectively bans screening the original prior to the release of the American version. What a load of capitalist BS. Anyhoo. Pulse is a great movie, seek it out, see it, and hopefully enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the comments on this site about this movie are glowing, "creepiest horror movie ever" for example. This movie has its creepy moments, but it feels like it's 4 hours long. There's just not enough happening. The story follows two groups of people figuring out the truth about the ghosts. Unfortunately that means they both retread the same ground the other group has just figured out. If it had followed a single group the pace might have held together, but this movie has too much time for too few distinct events to make it worthwhile. It has an extensive focus on loneliness, but it's rather ham handed. Loneliness as a theme in a movie should be evoked, not have a ton of lines saying "oh no, we're all alone". If I had to sum up the story of this movie in one line, it would be life sucks and then you die (and the audience cheers because something finally happened).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest film experiences ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, bit late on this one I know, but have to add that I saw this alone on Saturday night and it was undoubtedly one of the scariest cinematic experiences I've ever had. The first hour is genuinely creepy with visuals and sounds that disturb, creep and scare in equal measures and if the second hour foregoes this for a more apocalyptic allegorical approach this can be forgiven for giving us an excellent two hours of thought-provoking AND scary film making. Still not sure what a lot of it meant but it's stuck with me now two days later and no greater praise can I offer. If you like your horror challenging, seek this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird an scary as heck!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a horror movie which is terrific in it's suspense. The first BOOH! came after, like, five minutes. The whole audience literally jumped where they sat! It was a combination of scary music, hushed noises in the background and a shadowy figure behind a curtain... I won't say too much... :)To be honest I didn't quite follow all the logic and attempts at explaining what went on by the characters. In that way, the movie was actually kind of David Lynch-ish: giving clues and a mildly complicated and fuzzy plot, while scaring the wits out of you at the same time.The acting was good. Or maybe I can't always tell, because the language makes it difficult... (The English translation wasn't all that good either, but that's aside.) The photography was great, and, in my opinion, there were some really smart use of CGI without becoming, like, jurassic park, if you know what I mean. And Tokyo is a BIG city, a feeling that really is overwhelming in this movie. (And after all, it's about being alone amongst everybody.)And the music... Oh, my! Great score in every way.I recommend this movie. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves to be called one of the scariest movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of friends suddenly see Tokyo and the rest of the world slowly die out, and they believe it's because everyone has been look at a "Ghost site". Supposedly, the spirit world has filled up it's space, and now the dead are seeping into our world using the internet and technology."Kairo" (aka Pulse) is without a doubt one of the most chilling, complex, scariest movies to come out of the Asian Horror boom. The movie is only has a few tense and creepy scenes, but if you come to this film with those expectations, you'll be highly disappointed. Kairo is a mind-bender and social commentary that not only delivers those two aspects perfectly, but also some haunting imagery. Probably the scariest thing about "Kairo" is the message director Kiyoshi Kurosawa delivers. He makes the point that the advances of technology is not bringing us closer, but is instead separating us and from each other, and ultimately, depressing us and filling us with loneliness.This is a truly stunning movie. If you liked Ring(u), Dark Water, or any of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's other movies, get a hold of this as soon as you can. I can guarantee that you won't regret it one bit.My rating: 10/10. An utter masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Asian horror film - didn't hit the mark for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited to watch "Kairo" as I'd heard some really great things about it. Sadly, the film left me feeling disappointed.The chill factor that I was expecting proved to be almost non-existent. There are some cleverly staged shock scenes (a suicide scene in an industrial area is very effective) but nothing that really worked as effectively as, say, a "BOO!" sequence in "Audition." The plot is somewhat confusing but everything gells by the end.As an atmospheric example of Asian horror, I'd recommend this film with a few reservations. I just don't think it's in the same league as "Ju-On: The Grudge" or "The Ring".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, Kiyoshi Kurosawa's 'Pulse' (or 'Kairo') is the richest and scariest horror film ever made. Naturally, it goes over the heads of most idiotic American movie-goers, who prefer their horror loud, overblown and spoon-fed.If this isn't your cup of tea, go rent a Vin Diesel movie. If you want something that doesn't treat you like a moron; something that forces you to use your imagination; something that crawls under your skin and slowly ravages you...look no further.And a note to Hollywood: Don't even try to remake this. 'The Ring' remake was bad enough. Quit trying to commercialise the uncommercial. Just release the original films to the people that are smart enough to appreciate them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In general I'm a big admirer of Kiyoshi Kurosawa. I thought his films Cure and Charisma were both excellent, all the more so for leaving lots of room to the viewer for interpretation and ambiguity.Unfortunately, this film isn't one of his better works. It seems rather like the director's personal remake of Ring(u), covering many of the same themes of technological angst and ghost stories. It even has the now archetypal figures in white with long black hair. The plot is muddled and meandering, and while the plots of Charisma and Cure were also muddled, it seemed as though those films actually had a central idea that they were aiming for. Pulse just seems like a mishmash of early 21st-century Japanese horror tropes, fused clumsily to the apocalyptic themes common in the nineties and before (as seen in copious anime from, say, Barefoot Gen onwards). Kurosawa does try to impose some structure on the movie with visual motifs and his usual excellent command of atmosphere, but it isn't enough to keep the movie interesting without a strong story to back it up.Kiyoshi Kurosawa is definitely a director worth watching. I wouldn't say the same for this film, although if you're already interested in Kurosawa it is worth tracking down (Cure - or Kyua - would be a better movie for newbies to start with, though). It is, at least, better than the noodling Doppelganger, which blends Pulse's fuzzy purposelessness with some poorly executed light comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a jaded horror-movie fan, hence approximately once in a blue moon do I get to watch a film from this genre that has me glued to the screen rather than bored or sneering/almost laughing at the gore when I'm not supposed to. But perhaps that was the key here, the essential ingredient - or rather the lack of it: the fact that there is no gore. Just like in the Japanese "Ringu", the eeriness comes out of what is insinuated rather than catchup-stained limbs flying through rooms as if they had wings. "Kairo" remains interesting in spite of its 2-hour length, although a little editing snip here or there might have made it a little more compact. The dialogue is mostly standard, i.e. not that interesting (with some exceptions), so it's the ghost scenes that elevate this movie above 98% of the usual horror crap. The story is slightly muddled (or were my subtitles bad?) but it matters not. "Kairo" shows once again why the Japanese (or Orientals in general) have an upper hand in the genre in recent years.And even if you disliked it: it still beats watching a Stephen King or Wes Craven film, doesn't it? Plus, Japanese actresses are so much better-looking than the increasingly ugly, masculine blonds Hollywood serves us lately..."Printo screenki": this is how one male character referred to a certain computer-keyboard feature...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie very painful to watch. I just kept waiting for it to get scary or even interesting, but it just never got there. I had to watch the last 1/2 hour on 2X speed just so I could say that I finished it. Question, why are they still using dial up internet? The special effects weren't anything special either; they mainly looked like blobs on the screen. And when I finally saw a ghost, I laughed! Don't even get me started on the music/sound effects? I think I could make scarier sounds with my hand under my armpit. This was truly a waste of time. I heard the English version, Pulse, is supposed to be worse.

		<shortDescription>Outstanding movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*review contains spoilers!* This is an excellent Japanese movie. It's thoughtful, creepy, unsettling &amp; very well directed by Kurosawa Kiyoshi. On the one hand you have your standard urban horror themes of loneliness &amp; technology-as-villain (in this case computers &amp; the net). On the other there's this speculation about what might be waiting for us 'on the other side.' Is death, as one of the characters wonders aloud at one point, a chance to be reunited with loved ones &amp; so no longer endure the day to day loneliness of life? But as it turns out, being dead is just as miserable &amp; painful an experience for the ghosts as being alive is for the human characters, something Kurosawa demonstrates in a number of genuinely unsettling sequences.Kiyoshi has an excellent &amp; mature style - demonstrating a preference for long takes (a style that'll likely drive impatient teenage horror fans up the wall) &amp; shocks achieved within the frame rather than through flashy editing. Two sequences epitomise this - in one a young woman searches an apartment for her co-worker in vain while a shadowy figure rises silently from a chair at the back of the room behind her. It might not sound terribly creepy but honestly I think my heart skipped a beat when that happened. In the other - &amp; this is undoubtedly one of the films most talked about moments - a woman jumps to her death &amp; the camera unblinkingly records her fall &amp; impact with no cutting away.But don't get the idea this is some J-horror gorefest because it isn't. What's so refreshing for me about 'Pulse' is that rather than harping on gore &amp; shocks for two hours the director takes the time to lay out an intriguing story. One in which ghosts are flooding back into our world because there's no more room in theirs. The only trouble being that when ghosts &amp; real people come into physical contact with each other neither can survive. Throughout Pulse Kurosawa balances the increasingly apocalyptic imagery of a hi-tech Tokyo in which life has all but ceased with an insistently humanist theme. Our characters clearly care for each other &amp; the story culminates with a small group of survivors setting sail toward an uncertain future. Meanwhile the heroine of the story comes to realise that having found a temporary happiness with the young student who helped her escape she now has the strength to go on.I'd like to think that's really what Kurosawa is getting at here. Not for him the simple scares of a ghost story, nor the fashionable sense of nihilism (hey, we're all doomed!) which so appeals to moody teenagers, but the message that in life the small bonds we make with each other, those passing moments of happiness &amp; kindness, these are what shield us from loneliness &amp; enable us to keep going in an unforgiving universe. Seen that way it makes for an appropriate visual metaphor that the final shot of Pulse is a stunning birds-eye view of a tiny shipful of humanity adrift in a vast ocean.I look forward to seeing more films by Kurosawa Kiyoshi.One last point: a sequence in Pulse depicts a jetliner seen from street level falling out of the sky &amp; crashing into a building. On the DVD featurette there's a behind-the-scenes glimpse of a location recce for this particular scene. The date? June 2000. Talk about prophetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enojyable, yet mixed, effort from the productive teen psychological horror market...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ringu has a lot to answer for. Since its release, a whole raft of movies form the far east have come out in the new wave of psychological horror movies. Some work whilst some miserable fail. this one, straddles in between.The tale mirrors Ringu too closely in some ways for comfort. A mysterious computer like virus or program is leading to haunt teenagers, pushing some to commit suicide or simply disappear. Inevitably leads to our sleuths in the movie chasing up after it all. Along the way there is a parallel story of one computer newbie who somehow finding the virus enlists the help of a beautiful computer expert lady. That is the most interesting part of the film, whilst the rest of the movie doesn't seem to know where its going, if anything the rest appears to be heading somewhere without a map, and meanders too much. Incomprehensive and disjointed, the movie does end up losing focus storywise.The main saving grace is the fear factor. Surprsingly, not really frightening, yet its all in the mind and you are on tenterhooks. This plays very well, and i enjoyed this fact for some reason. Acting is poor in general, but not always bad. The film is a disappointment, but then again it is in competition against some stellar movies.Overall, i wouldn't recommend, but there are far worse out there. Not one to go out of your way for, but not necessarily one for the video hell either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a while now, I've been trying to find Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Korei (aka. Seance). Admittedly, I'm not familiar with Kiyoshi Kurosawa's work, except for what i had seen in some asian film magazines and I was hooked already. But I truly was not prepared for KAIRO.This film is just plain terrifying. I really, really want to explain what this film is about but it'll only ruin the film, in my opinion. Plus, there is still somethings that I don't understand, but loved anyway.If I had to sum up this film, I'd probably have to say that it's a story about the end of the world from the most unlikely place. From within. Anymore info would just be cruel to give up.Though I've been vague about what goes on in the film I will say this. The atmosphere makes this movie everything that it is. In modern times many filmmakers go for the character's coming out loud and clear, and the atmosphere/environment is relegated to 2nd or even 3rd place. But here the true "star" of the film is the creepy and almost unbearably docile environment surrounding, enchanting, and swallowing up the main characters. There's a thin line between good Japanese horror (Ring) and bad Japanese horror (Inugami), this flick is so far from bad that it's practically holding hands with Ring as they stroll into my dvd collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kyoshi Kurosawa Is The Greatest Horror Director That Ever Lived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The philosophical premise of Kairo is nihilism expressed through loneliness. The superficial "connections" that one sustains with other people are conveyed as brittle, meaningless trivialities that shatter when confronted with the relentless isolation that exists on a much deeper level. Not one person is murdered in this 119 minute film for the very fact that the victims are consumed with a sense of eternal loneliness ? many times caused by seeing spirits ? and therefore take their own lives. There are no cheap scares in this picture, as it relies on disturbing, long-sustained images highlighted by awkward ghost movements. Classic scenes and imagery abound in this tour de force directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa.Kiyoshi is a criminally unknown director who is undoubtedly the single best filmmaker in the history of horror cinema. Unfortunately, many people confuse greatness with influence. Hideo Nakata is not a great director, but he did influence the entire film-making industry with Ringu. Kiyoshi Kurosawa, on the other hand, just makes great films ? Kairo, Cure, Charisma, Retribution, Séance, Loft, etc. That's the essential difference between excellence and mere market influence. Now, Kiyoshi does get some respect from both moviegoers and critics alike, but there are some common complaints that I would like to address in conjunction with this review of Kairo.The most outrageous criticism of Kiyoshi is that his films lack content. This is a patently false (and downright ridiculous) claim that holds no weight whatsoever. Taking Kairo as an example, there are a number of subtle references to LONELINESS throughout the entirety of the film ? the literal isolation of characters, the individual dots expressed within the computer program, the patterns of dissolved ash, the influence of communication and information through both ghostly apparitions as well as red tape, apocalyptic doom, suicide, character mannerisms and interrelationships, etc. In other words, there's a boatload of content in Kairo. Those who say otherwise have no idea what they're talking about.This structure of film-making is one thing that makes Kiyoshi so amazing. He takes a simple concept like loneliness and creates a constellation of phenomena that reference back to the underlying theme of the film. The same is true with Cure (identity), Charisma (false dichotomies, relationship between the individual and society), Retribution (memory), Loft (memory), and others. It's a fascinating method of storytelling that's so much fun to watch despite the glacial pacing from which it's presented. Don't fool yourself: the entertainment value of Japanese horror is frequently about content, and Kairo is a perfect horror movie largely because of its philosophical elements. How many other films can make the same claim? What more do you people want? How the massive quantity of content within Kiyoshi's cinematic portfolio goes unnoticed is beyond me. The only possible explanation is that his stunning talent for creating dense atmosphere leads some viewers to overlook his content. Still, there's no excuse for missing it, especially considering how badly made dramas get all sorts of credit where none is due. For example, there are tons of reviews for Tsai Ming-liang's dreadfully atrocious Viva L'Amour that gloat about that movie's depiction of solitude. I read these reviews with the knowledge that Kairo gets little to no credit for its truly amazing portrayal of loneliness. The whole scenario makes me want to puke.Another criticism of Kiyoshi is that his films are "self-indulgent." What a load of twaddle coming from reviewers who consider Akira Kurosawa to be the best thing since sliced bread. Anyone dim-witted enough to claim that Akira Kurosawa's Dreams is less indulgent than Kairo should immediately check themselves into a mental institution. So Akira gets a free pass at self-masturbatory cinema because some Californian bloodsuckers propped him up on an undeserving pedestal? You people are a joke. From the standpoint of sheer directorial precision and scriptwriting, Akira doesn't even deserve to sniff Kiyoshi's jockstrap.Then we have all sorts of assertions that say Kiyoshi's films are slow and boring, but most of these comments are made by Hollywood fanboys who drool over rat-infested garbage like Friday the 13th, Freddy vs. Jason, and Alien vs. Predator. I would expect this reaction from those with such narrow-minded "tastes" in film. Just leave the intelligent horror cinema to the big boys and go back to worshipping overrated hacks like Wes Craven.But that's not all. We have even more ludicrous complaints coming from Westerners like, "The Japanese take their horror films too seriously." I laugh when hearing stuff like this. God forbid someone actually puts some effort into making a horror film. Has the Hollywood horror industry really crumbled to the point where even their most fervent followers don't expect anything remotely ambitious? That's a pretty pathetic state to be in.The point of this review-turned-rant is to simply point out the obvious: Kiyoshi Kurosawa is the greatest horror filmmaker that ever lived. It might just be my opinion, but considering how any and all criticism seems to be based on illogic or narrow-mindedness, there's really no valid reason for believing otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kairo/Pulse's reputation - as a "scary", "frightening", "depressing" movie - is undeserved. Although the beginning has a couple of good scares, the film loses narrative impetus after about twenty minutes, settling into a shapeless, baggy, scare-less middle act that bored and alienated me. The actors run the gamut of emotions from depressed to catatonic. The presentation of the ghosts is obviously cribbed from other, better J-Horror movies. Portentous scene follows portentous scene, but there's no substance, no care taken to give us a sense of the rules of the game, or the cause- and-effect of the story. That means precious little sense of human motivation. If you're like me and my friends, after half an hour you'll start laughing at the sheer randomness of the action and dialog, as well as the invariably stupid choices made by the characters. At the showing I attended, the theater was almost deserted; I should have taken that as a hint to leave and ask for my money back. Maybe Kairo's supposed to be an allegory or a parable; whatever it is, it's not drama that'll excite or engage you on any level. Go rent Ju-On 2 instead.</fullReview>

The only suspense in this movie is about knowing when it will end. Kairo has hype, the director's name, and red tape. I've seen South Park cartoons which have more internal consistency and more horror than this. In the Extras the director comments that he "doesn't put too much thought into it", and that's painfully obvious watching the film. I predict the American version due out this summer will make hundreds of millions, but not because of the story's quality: viewers will be embarrassed to admit they paid to see this crap, and will tell everyone else to see it.</fullReview>

Clucky ghost images photoshopped on pictures ("He! Look over there...is that..is that a face?" -zoom in on face- -Oops, sound breaks off- 'chop' -next scene- ), scenes and sequences are poorly edited and as a result don't flow at all. You'll be watching a girl finding a corpse still hanging from the knot in one scene and then literally 10 seconds later seeing her again at some place apparently unaffected, smiling and going about.Apart from the many problems I have with the movie in terms of production-value, it is also painfully long and repetitive and thus utterly boring.I recommend 'Shutter' in stead, an oriental (Thai) horror movie done well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kairo, or Pulse as it's known amongst English speaking audiences, is set in Tokyo &amp; starts as Sunny Plant Sales employee Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) decides to visit her friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to enquire about a computer disk he's been working on, when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her. Meanwhile a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) has recently hooked up to the internet &amp; keeps getting spooky messages &amp; images on his monitor so he ask's computer whizz Harue Karasawa (Koyuki) whats happening, she doesn't really know but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full &amp; they need somewhere else to go &amp; Earth is as good a place as any, right? These spirits don't like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that, I don't really know because the films a bit of a mess...This Japanese production was written &amp; directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa &amp; right off the bat I have to say I hated Kairo, I hated everything about it &amp; it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Asian cinema can produce something as crap as any American filmmaker. The script is an overlong mess, the thing simply doesn't make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film, sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way &amp; Kairo is also the most downright boring film I've sat through this year. At two hours long this is a real chore to sit through, I really wanted to fast-forward it but I'm fair if nothing else so I stuck it out to the bitter end &amp; frankly wished I hadn't. There are so many things wrong with Kairo, I suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous &amp; deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which I despise in a film unless they are done properly. Then there's the whole internet thing which I just couldn't relate to at all, I use the internet all day &amp; it's not in the least bit scary to me in any way. Then there's the fact that Kairo as a film provided zero entertainment value for me, maybe I'm a Neanderthal but I kind of like the films I watch to entertain me, make some sort of sense &amp; not bore me to death.Director Kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as I'm concerned, if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the DVD &amp; you be fast asleep within 10 minutes I guarantee you. I didn't think Kairo was scary in the slightest, the whole internet thing was laughable &amp; as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement pop-up ads I get, now that's scary! I hate this film, I hate this film, I'm sorry I just need to make that basic point again, twice. Forget about any action, tension or gore as there isn't any. If you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly PG rated stuff all the way. Urgh.The film looks so dull &amp; boring it's untrue, the camera just sits there for very long shots &amp; when it does move it moves very slowly, this has all the style of a Mexican soap opera. Since Kairo is sub titled it's difficult to judge the original performances so I won't bother, it's hard to care for someone when they don't even speak the same language &amp; you don't know what they are saying.Kairo is crap, I hated it &amp; it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that. Just because it's an Asian flick doesn't automatically make it any good &amp; the mess of a story, the plot holes, the fact it makes no sense &amp; it's an absolute bore means Kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an American production. The worst film I've seen this year by some distance. Kairo got a Hollywood remake as Pulse (2006).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And they said that Americans made bad horror flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man what a waste of time. Was this meant to be creepy? The movie was not as creepy and intense as the American version. The movies script was just plain stupid. Every shot and scene was so long and repetitive, that the movie could have lasted only 30 minutes and not 2 hours. Also the movie wasn't that scary, the creepy thing about it is the background music, that stupid wailing that was trying to get into the mood of spook. The acting was not convincing, and it was very bad. If this movie was a success in Japan, then the American movie The Unborn and Sarah Landon and the Paranormal hour would have won a thousand awards. Compare the American and Japanese version. I would say that the American version was better, that one had better acting, a better script, more intensity (this one was not that intense) and plenty of scare that I was covering my eyes. Of course this movie failed to scare me. People say that this movie was about the moral of loneliness and other stuff, but that moral was just plain ridiculous, it made absolutely no sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrid, absolutely horrid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This movie did the impossible.While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. As in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. The acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script. Did these people even get any direction? Were they coaxed to be boring and dull? Either therory wouldn't surprise me.What was even worse was the rather unscary make-up involved with the creatures from the other side. Either way, they all stunk. Don't watch this film. That's all I can say (unless you're an insomniac).</fullReview>
