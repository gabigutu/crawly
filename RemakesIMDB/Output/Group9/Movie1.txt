		<shortDescription>Sort of a pointless exercise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 'Alfie,' released in 1966, was considered a revelation for its frank and somewhat dark portrait of the life of a cockney rake, and can now be seen as somewhat prophetic, as it predated (and in some ways helped to introduce) the era of 'swinging London' and the sexual revolution. The 2004 'Alfie' seems to exist for no other purpose than to dress Jude Law up in a hip wardrobe and allow him to wink, smirk, and sigh endlessly at the camera as he sleeps his way through a series of likable women he doesn't deserve. There isn't much of a narrative structure here, and while Law is an engaging screen presence, Alfie is a totally unsympathetic lout who deserves his eventual comeuppance.It's too bad that Bill Naughton wasn't able to update his original story more effectively, because the film is gorgeous to look at. Despite a few unnecessary bits of cleverness (billboards with odd, art-nouveau messages like 'desire' and 'wish', a lot of mod-ish split screen sequences with still photography, etc.), the cinematography is superb, Law looks dashing in his GQ hipster wardrobe, and the ladies--Susan Sarandon, Jane Krakowski, Nia Long, Marisa Tomei, and newcomer Sienna Miller (whom Law apparently dumped his wife for during filming)--are ravishing. The soundtrack is also superb, made up mostly of new tunes by Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart (of Eurythmics fame).The biggest problem here is that times have changed since the original Alfie: sexual and gender politics don't allow for a protagonist who bed-hops and deceives women with impunity to be cast as heroic or even remotely sympathetic. In the end, the film seems hollow, like a nearly two-hour long visual fashion spread (interestingly, 'Vanity Fair' editor Graydon Carter has a cameo in the film). Beautiful to look at, but ultimately it's just pretty trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jude must be taking the Michael...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a lot of people know this, but Terence Stamp first played the role of Alfie on stage over thirty years ago. He was then offered the film role, but turned it down. His flatmate, a struggling up and coming actor, tried to convince him to take the part, but Terence was not budging. And so his flatmate took the role. His name, was Michael Caine, and that film, Alfie, spring boarded the young actor to be the most famous cockney in the world. Of all Caine's films this ranks alongside Get Carter and The Italian Job as his best, and so why re-make it I hear you cry! Hollywood had a go at remaking The Italian Job and Get Carter but only came out with turkeys so big you couldn't fit them in your oven. But instead of remaking a Michael Caine film that wasn't good (THE SWARM, BLAME IT ON RIO!) Caine's golden classic Alfie has had the makeover, with pretty boy Jude Law bought in to ask what it's all about. Well for those who don't know what it's all about, Alfie's world is women, pulling them and dumping them. Sounds a little cold, but that is Alfie, a bird puller extraordinaire who lives for the conquests, but soon bores of them whenever commitment rears it's ugly head. Of course Alfie has to be bought down a peg or two, and this happens as a result of another conquest, which has further reaching consequences than Alfie can realize. But should Alfie have been dusted down for the 2004 audience? Well the answer is no. But why? Well, to analyse this we have to go back to the beginning and what Alfie was in Caine's day. Alfie was a man about town stuck in the poor end of London, sleeping his way through a never ending supply of 'birds' while fighting his working class shackles. Back then women were not the powerful sex they are today, at least not on the cinema screen, and were happy to get Alfie's dinner and scrub his floors. Now lets look at Jude Laws Alfie, living in present day New York, and sleeping with a seemingly never ending amount of stunners, who all seem to be getting as much out of him as he gets out of them. And so what's he got to fight against? Not his surroundings (he's in glamorous Manhattan) and his job isn't that bad (still a driver, but look at the perks), and he even likes the kid of one of his girlfriends. And so he's a nice guy, and there is problem 1, bang goes Alfie's cold side. And so what we are left with is a man who lives in New York and finds it hard to commit. Hardly a rare phenomenon. Problem number 2 is the original Alfie movie's use of the shock factor. Denholm Elliott turning up to do a back street abortion was enough to make some walk out the cinema in 1966. In this film the subject of abortion, although delicately handled, has lost it's cinematic impact, which is no doubt due to the three decades that has passed between films. And so we come to problem number 3, the films flaw being that the Alfie of today is simply not as relevant to the Alfie of yesterday. Today we have 'Sex and the City', empowered women, whom one can't help but feel would eat Alfie up alive. Indeed, the film would be more realistic if the lead was a female, although that would send traditionalists (like myself) running up the nearest tree. The makers of this re-make obviously think that illnesses has to be stepped up, and so while Caine's Alfie was given shadows on his lung to make him give pause, Law's Alfie gets a lump on his?erm?'Big Ben' (I hope to God that's not the new word for it) But what about performances? Well, Law as Alfie is fine, giving emotion where its needed, although his performance does not bounce along like Caines did. When Caine spoke to the camera, immediately breaking the fourth wall and bonding with the audience, it was the height of cool, when Law does the same it feels cheesy, and like cheese, it soon starts to grate. Susan Sarandon, as the sexy older woman, certainly fulfils her characters description, while Sienna Miller gives a promising portrayal as a young women who looks like a young Marianne Faithful (circa 1965) minus her Rolling Stone. And so the blame for the films failure cannot be left at its actors doors, nor its director. The film is simply a victim of its time. Alfie belongs in the sixties, when the world (or London at least) was swinging. Right now the only thing swinging is the cinema doors, and that's because I've just left.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, what a powerful film the original Alfie was. What amazing creativity, themes, and structure it had! It was enjoyable to watch because Caine has this uncanny ability to bring you into his world. He is so calm and "everyday" that Alfie's words pull you into the screen and allow you to become involved with his life. I only wish this could have been true with this disastrous remake. Jude Law attempts at every angle possible to bring that pizazz that Caine brought to the screen, but ultimately fails in every attempt. While Caine, in the original, felt like he could have represented you or I, Law in this film, feels like he is ripped from the pages of Vogue or In Style magazine. You know that point in a magazine where you feel that the ads featuring models wearing clothes that you will never fully appreciate seem to clutter the pages instead of articles? Well, that is exactly what this remake felt to me. Instead of a powerful story being the central focus of the film, we were bombarded, nearly drowned, in model-esquire images of the people of NYC and how only the very beautiful are attracted to the very beautiful. Coupled with cinematography that feels like a super-budged GAP ad, I could only squint as my stomach hurled with disgust."What's it all about, Alfie?" A simple question that is the central focus of the first film, while in this pathetic remake, it is never disclosed until the very end. Why did this film suffer? First of all, Jude Law is no Michael Caine. He doesn't have that "every man" sort of appeal that dragged me into the film. I never really felt like he was talking to me, but instead trying to maneuver his way into the mantra of the female audience. That was a huge problem for me as well, in the original, Caine talks to the men of the audience, while in the remake, Law attempts to gain sympathy from the females in the audience. Law just cannot seem to capture the ideals of Alfie. He is a womanizer, I know that, but there are more layers to this character than just that. Sadly, Law brought none of them out. Even at the end, I never felt as if there was a final moment of realization or symbolic referencing. "What was it all about?" The original, I could tell you, for this remake, it seemed a bit fuzzy and dislocated. I don't know what it was about except a man not committed to anything glides through life with a smile somehow still located on his face. Perhaps it wasn't just Law's work, but also the ladies that accompanied him. These are women that the average man will never meet, or ever encounter. So, how could we relate to the story? Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon, Nia Long, and even Sienna Miller seemed to give glamorized renditions of hurt women. The original was about Alfie, but several believe that the staples to the story were the women that surrounded him. I can honestly say that the staples to this film were not the women, because Jude Law hailed top billing. Did the director even see the original? I would like to address the issue of whether this was a remake or just an "updated" version of the original Alfie. My answer is that it is a remake that crashes considerably when you place the two films together. My biggest issue with this remake was that it addressed nothing. In the original film, it was apparent from the first 30 minutes of the movie that Alfie was a troubled man who carried trouble on his back and deposited trouble to each one of his encounters. One might even say victims. Was it a sign of the times or something that is inherent in the female species that lead to the destruction of so many hopes and dreams? The 60's were a time of floundering economically and politically for most of the world. Did Alfie seize on the free-sex, free love atmosphere that became prevalent during that time or were his predatory skills developed much earlier in his life? Alfie wasn't strong enough a character to go into self-destruct alone. The weakness of his character insisted that he bring everyone down with him. Just as in the animal kingdom the predator preys on the victim that is unsuspecting, most vulnerable and most importantly the victim who cannot hurt him. He must always stay insulated from the outside world. Yet, in the remake, I saw nothing of the sort. I saw random chaos where Hollywood regained our sympathy by making our lead character this "can never be mad at Jude Law". Not living in NYC or in a place where models walk around on the streets, nor a frequent viewer of Vogue magazine, I didn't find the appeal of subtle themes of this film at all. Alfie goes through the motions as he does in the original, but there is considerable chunk of life missing.Overall, this was a very disappointing remake. The music just didn't seem to carry that same charm that the original did, nor did the rest of the cast. This was not an art film, but instead a Hollywood creation that lacked the appeal of the original. It was created to boost some sex appeal for Jude Law instead of showing this radical vision of our world. Alfie is genuine in the original, and quite plastic in this remake, which ultimately hurt the overall impression of the film. Those that say that you cannot compare the original and this remake together because they are two separate films, I would completely disagree with. This Alfie was a remake and was poorly put together while the original was, "powerful, humorous, yet pointed story".Grade: ** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's it all about? (opening line from the original-movie 1966)"Alfie" is a remake of the 1966 British film that made an international star of Michael Caine. It takes a story very much associated with a particular time and place -- London in the swinging '60s -- and successfully transplants it to modern-day New York City. The cockney lothario played by Caine has been turned into a working-class British émigré played by Jude Law, who makes Alfie a bit less cockney and a bit more self-aware.Alfie's a smooth talking Londoner in New York who does his very best to avoid succumbing to the dreaded 'c' word commitment. Along the way, we're introduced to some of his ladies on the go ? Dorie, Julie, Liz and Nikki, to name but a few. Like the earlier "Alfie," it's the story of a sexually promiscuous man. Alfie (Law), a chauffeur, lives in a small Manhattan apartment and dedicates his life to seducing women. Talking directly into the camera, and preening with a self-satisfaction so complete as to seem a form of innocence, he expounds on clothes, the proper application of cologne and the various rules he employs in his libidinous pursuits. His goal, it seems, is to have sex with as many women as possible but to get close to none of them.Each one starts off as a fling, but somehow manages to influence Alfie's life. He slowly starts to realize that he is actually alone and that there is more to life than what he has done so far. Like the earlier "Alfie," the new version could be called a cautionary tale, about a way of life that leads to the existential confusion embodied in the famous catchphrase, "What's it all about?" Anyone we know in it? Jude Law is fresh and funny as Alfie, with just the right amount of smug attitude. The stunning Sienna Miller is the beautiful but 'damaged' Nikki, and Susan Sarandon sizzles as the sexy older woman, Liz. There's also Marisa Tomei (Julie), Nia Long (Lonette) and Omar Epps plays Alfie's best friend, Marlon.Would I recommend it? Definitely. Although remakes do not usually come through smelling of roses, this one does. It's fresh, colourful and funny. Jude Law is magnificent, introducing us to a slightly warmer side of Alfie than Michael Caine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... as I haven't (FAR too young when it originally came out!), and can judge the movie without preconceptions, it's actually quite, quite good. From others' comments, I believe this should be called a reconception rather than a remake - and face it, if they followed the original, time-bound character/plot, it really WOULDN'T work today - so there is no sense in decrying that this isn't slavish to the Caine version. On its own terms, the movie is very stylish, with excellent cinematography, directing and editing, and the acting is top-notch across the board [For Broadway aficionados, look for Tony winners Jefferson (I Am My Own Wife) Mays as the Doctor and Hairspray's Dick Latessa as Joe]. Law is disarmingly charming as Alfie, and that goes a long way in selling the character, and making his attitude towards women somewhat tolerable. Of the women, Sarandon {looking incredible for 58! ... and delivering her final coup de grace with devilish elan], Long, Krakowski and especially (surprisingly?) Law's current squeeze Miller all make strong impressions. Tomei is OK, but is really neither attractive or special enough to justify Law's interest in her [and his fixation on her young son is a little creepy/unbelievable for such a womanizer]. The substitution of the interracial dalliance with Long for the abortion is a stroke of genius, as it will probably have the same 'shocking' effect for some in the audience. Yes, the direct address is a little jarring at times, but is necessary and DOES follow the original.On the minus side, the Mick Jagger/Dave Stewart music DOESN'T work, but Joss Stone's remake of the title song is effective. If you can forget, or better yet, haven't seen the original to compare this version to, I think you will find it a very entertaining, relevant movie (compared to most Hollywood remake dreck). I wouldn't even be surprised to find this garnering quite a few Oscar noms (given this year's weak field) come the end of the year... Give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm totally and undoubtedly in love with Jude Law. Or is it Alfie? I truly can't tell them apart. Jude Law is an excellent actor, I've always thought so. And the way he captures me from the very first frame in this movie, is something that for me is very rare in times of shallow and soulless film-making. I want to be amazed! And I was, over and over again. Alfie suited Law perfectly, and the way he acts assures me of his passion for his job. Every line is perfection, every look, every move, down to the smallest wink. The story makes me laugh, cry, curse in foreign languages, and smile of recognition. Everyone needs to see this movie, male, female, young, old, single, married. It really get's you thinking about relationships and what role we play in this game of love. How do we appreciate what we have, and how do we let go of what we have no longer? To move on and try to overcome the guilt, the betrayals, let-downs and broken hearts. Dig deep inside and find those feelings you didn't think you had, until you realize they were just hiding in the shadows waiting for you to make a move. To seize opportunities and knowing when to hold on. To find true love... isn't that what it's all about, Alfie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lets do the time warp now!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are always a problem for the critic, whether or not he or she has seen the original. Here we have an American remake in 2004 of a British film made by Lewis Gilbert in 1966, itself an adaptation of a stage play by Bill McNaughton from the early 60s. The creative process is not easy to track in these circumstances, even though the DVD I saw has two sets of audio-commentary by the director, Charles Shyer, and others.In this version Alfie is still the chirpy cockney Lothario, but operating as a chauffeur in lower Manhattan rather than London. His women are characters derived from the 1966 film, but glamorised somewhat. Alfie's philosophy, delivered face to camera, as in the first film, is the same ? love 'em and leave 'em.As Alfie, Jude Law channels Michael Caine in the 1966 film but puts his own stamp on the role. Jude is exactly right for the part and makes Alfie both repellent and sympathetic. We are left hoping he will mend his ways but thinking there's not much chance of that. For Alfie, there is no answer to the question posed in the song "What's it all about?" The music, written and performed by another hardy survivor of swinging London in the 60s, Mick Jagger (and others) is a pleasant feature, and Alfie's girls are undeniably attractive. (During filming Jude Law and Sienna Miller became an item ? that's method acting for you.) Charles Shyer tells us in the audio-commentary that he set out to be stylish and there's considerable use of split-screen technique and some fancy cutting. Using Manchester, Liverpool and London as Manhattan as well as Manhattan itself for location shooting must have caused some production problems, though most of them seemed to have been overcome in post-production.This 2004 version did decent business in the UK but bombed in the US. Why? The hero is a Brit, but then so is James Bond. The women are all accomplished actresses and Susan Sarandon delivers a standout performance. There is plenty of relatively tasteful humour but no happy ending, just "life goes on". The pace is fast enough and Shyer slaps on plenty of "style", but what we are seeing is the 1966 film lite. A period piece set in the wrong period. Elaine Pope, who co-wrote the screenplay with Shyer, was well aware that women are now less inclined to be doormats for feckless men like Alfie, and adjusted the female parts accordingly, but ultimately we have a movie 40 years out of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better "Alfie" version, hands down. A must-see movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm probably writing the only review which sees this newer version of Alfie as far, far better than the original. I know it will inflame many loyal fans of the Caine original, but I can easily say the Jude version is solidly better in every respect. But, I will admit that having seen the new version first, I can understand how some people may be biased in their opinion- typically the first version is better, and actually conditions your mind to unconsciously compare the new one with the old one. Nevertheless, it does not mean it should invalidate a review, provided that there is careful objectivity. I think most significant is the different type of film the Jude version is- a more engaging, heartfelt,'balanced' version with a both modern and vintage flare. The Caine version was way too cold, serious, dry, and somewhat humorless, and one could not relate to Caine's Alfie- he was a bit creepy and his womanizing behavior seemed more deliberate and emotionless, while Jude's Alfie is a more charming, sweet and in most ways innocent character who happens to indulge to excess seducing and ultimately manipulating women. But in the Jude Alfie, it's almost like a kid in a candy store who has a free pass to candy- Alfie's free pass is his charm and good looks which enables the Jude version to come across more convincing and lovable... as opposed to the Caine Alfie who is not especially handsome or charming and comes across as calculating and a true sexual compulsive. Don't get me wrong- I love Michael Caine and I am an old-movie buff and normally I prefer the original version of almost all films. But even great movies like The Maltese Falcon had a prior version before Humphrey Bogart which lacked the music, tempo, personality, humor, and emotional connection. Another 2nd and better version of other great movies are The Man Who Knew Too Much and Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Meet Joe Black. The originals are good in many ways, but lack the "total package" of a great movie, almost as if the first version were a rough draft. Anyway, getting back to the Jude Alfie...I really can't say enough about the impact the movie has on guys and girls in their 20s and 30s. It's a both bright and dark as well as moral movie without pontificating or preaching and it covers a myriad of aspects to relationships and many hard lessons and realities. Every character fits perfectly with the direction and writing of the film and seems real-life and just very engaging. Caine's Alfie seems like a psychological analysis of a sexually obsessed man who's bereft of emotion and the women he womanizes. His film is decent, but pales in comparison to other Caine films and frankly he is quite miscast for the role of Aflie. Jude Law is brilliant and one of the finest and most versatile (and under-used) actors I've ever seen (as he was in Talented Ripley). He literally becomes Alfie, a womanizer that you love but want to hate (but can't). And via his acting and his script, Jude makes you in many ways identify (and almost excuse) his character's behavior. The newer Alfie is written with a bluntness and brutal candor about the male and female gender and how we unconsciously see each other- this may come across as offensive to ultra liberals or feminists, but none of it is offensive or hurtful- it is just life's reality. The flow of the film is perfect and nicely edited and transitions seamlessly. The film has high points and low points, which the audience can relate to, and creates the effect of not making it a mono-toned film like the original Alfie, and this is what I meant by "balanced". For a film of this difficult subject matter to work right, it cannot be as somber, relentless and two-dimensional as Caine's version. A real expression of superb writing and direction in a film is when it can have both happy moments, funny moments, and immediately after have serious, even heartbreaking moments and ultimately teach a lesson which anyone can learn from. An example of the newer Alfie being a lighter film, but just as powerful and even more shocking is the discovery that he has a child which he had thought was aborted. This is likened to the Caine version where Alfie see's the actual aborted fetus remains and has an emotional breakdown. The new version is just as stunning (and actually more unexpected) and in my opinion more of a reality check of life's twists and turns and the lesson that our actions may have life long consequences. While I can appreciate the impact of the Caine sequence, it is basically 'over-dramatic' since the Jude version itself is just as or more effective and instead of horrifying the audience and unbalancing the film, it is both sad and happy when we learn Jude's Alfie has a son. This is just one example of the tone of the newer Alfie-- different, just as powerful, better acted, better written, better music, better scenery, better flow, more realistic, and far more enjoyable to watch. And most important, a film that literally all of us can identify with at some stages in out lives. Truly a great film. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jude Law stars as the lothario Alfie in the remake of the classic swaggering film which Michael Caine received a Best Actor nomination back in 1966. However, many critic pundits questioned Jude Law starring as Alfie on the remake of the classic film. They asked such questions as: Is it unlawful for Jude to try to duplicate the mastery of Caine? Is it unlawful for Jude to appear in yet another film in 2004? (Law appeared in 6 films in 2004) and Is it unlawful to cast who People Magazine selected as the sexiest man on earth as the womanizing British cad in New York? Hey, Jude! In my opinion, you have committed no unlawful cinematic crime. Your performance as Alfie was as vigorous and suave as they come! "The talking to the audience" bit as he plans out his next female conquest or dumpation was marvel cinematic magic. The hell with Superman or Batman, "Alfie" is a true marvel comic superhero. The women of "Alfie" were the tasty dishes of Fettuccini "Alfieredo". Nia Long, Marisa Tomei, Jane Krakowski, Sienna Miller, and the ageless Susan Sarandon were quite appetizing with their performances. Director Charles Shyer did the "shyer" thing by casting Law as Alfie. Writer Bill Naughton's naughty script was "Alfieboloso"; as whimsical as they come! So get struck by Alfie! Watch it today! It is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen! ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable and (largely) consistent film with some nice eye candy and an easy plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is well acted, presented and nicely produced. The characters feel real and there's some lovely location shots from the Waldorf Astoria to the City quayside. Close ups shots of the actors with sweet bohken don't feel cluttered or intrusive and the dialogue flows well.Storyline is simple enough, and shows Alfie at first as a bit of a hero in life and then as the plot progresses you see the cracks in the facade leading to his true predicament in the last ten minutes of the film.Probably the most challenging element for filming would have been Jude Law's soliloquies to the camera. These however are expertly segued in with the day to day events of the cast and add rather than detract from the story.The hardest part of the film for me is just who it's aimed at. Initially I'd assumed it was a chick flick, good looking lead actor, lots of relationship conversations and a distinct lack of explosives or action?. ...but then Sienna Miller comes along and gets naked. In this case it just didn't feel right in terms of timing or an appropriate way to make the scenes point. There were earlier opportunities to fit this in, but it comes out of the blue and lacked the subtlety it would have been easy to achieve. That said if you've got it, flaunt it and Sienna does it with an alacrity which will be painful for those who're not as lucky as she.The end result is a watchable and (largely) consistent film with some nice eye candy and an easy plot to follow. I'd recommend it if there's nothing else on, but there's stronger films out there if you're after a more challenging watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Humble, Unbiased Opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to start by saying I HAVE NOT SEEN THE ORIGINAL. A lot of the reviews here of this movie are just snide derision based on a bias set in place by the original film. I will also admit to buying my ticket solely because I had had a bad day and just wanted to relax with a 30 foot tall Jude Law winking at me in the audience and taking his shirt off a lot. I'm not ashamed. But what I got was something far more substantial. And of course there was the pleasantness of a half naked Jude Law, but there was also depth. A glimpse into the nature of the human psyche. What we do and why we do it, and ultimately: what it gets us in the end. Or rather, how it gets us.As I understand it, Caine as Alfie was a hell of a lot harder and brassier than this modern day version. To the extent at which his sexually-charged chauvinistic ideals would have put major rock stars to shame and surely cost the studio more than a little bank in complaints filed against it by today's slightly more feminist audiences. Some have said that by watering our hero's womanizing tendencies down a bit, the entire heart of the film is lost. I say this is not so. It makes you stop, makes you evaluate where you are in life and where you're going. And what the hell you're doing. Anybody can see a little Alfie in them, and trust me, it's scary as hell. But it's a wakeup call. A tool, if you will. You leave the theater feeling like you've learned something and you'll think about it all the way home. How often do you leave a movie and get that much out of it?Don't judge it by the original. Trust me, he's still a very bad boy. But he's sympathetic and insightful enough to make you wonder. Let it stand on it's own merit, and not by the standard Caine put in place 40 years ago. They're two different movies. Give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why Alfie isn't doing well at the box office. I loved it, it's the best romantic comedy I've seen in a long time. It was sexy, funny and it made me cry. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. I liked the fact that the ending wasn't predictable, it was actually bittersweet. Jude Law was really great in this film, very charismatic and he had a complex underlying vulnerability underneath it all. I wasn't a huge fan of his, but after this movie I definitely am. I should also mention that Omar Epps did a great job, probably his best performance, that I've seen. It's not your typical romantic comedy, not a chick flick, it has something for men and women alike. it's moving without being sappy. GO SEE IT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bravo! A remake that tops the original! I loved this movie. Kudos to Charles Shyer, Jude Law, and screenwriter Elaine Pope for making this awesome movie! Sure, I wish Michael Caine could have played the role of Joe and Shirley Winters had played Alfie's neighbor, but other than that I totally dug the film.Oh! And too bad the Rolling Stones didn't do the music. Sure, Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart did a great job, but if the Stones had done the music? Man! That woulda been ultra awesome! But yeah, this is a great story of a pretty boy Englishman ladies man and his trials and tribulations in modern day Manhattan! Great new setting for the remake! I think Alfie should have driven a motorcycle. A Rune. Other than his Vespa. I think the Vespa worked. But it wasn't ballsy enough I think. Still, it worked for the retro 60's vibe they were going for.The rest of the cast is perfect. Nia Long and Omar Epps are perfectly cast. And Jude Law? Whoa, this is one of his best performances. And Alfie's words about F.B.B. -- face, boobs, bum! And how those things are what matter most to men. Too true.And Jane Krakowski was great in her role. The scene where she is in the limo. It had a kind of S&amp;M feel to it with her hands in those straps. And man, her legs! Awesome! She is smokin' hot! You see just a bit of her naked bum in a shot where she walks off to meet her husband Phil the Pill after saying bye to Alfie. Hmmmmmmmm. Hot stuff.This is more of a guy flick than a chick flick. Hell, a story about a guy getting women left and right? Now that's a dick flick! HA! I liked lots of little details about this film. Alfie's relationship with Julie and the scene where she makes him a late night dinner of chili and French bread. Yum! And Alfie selecting his wardrobe of Gucci and pink shirt at the start of the film. I could never wear that color but it works in this flick! And the ending. Man! Heartbreaking, tragic and magic! A guy who is doomed. But maybe there is some hope for him. Maybe. And! This is probably the old Charles Shyer directed film I've ever loved.Old habits die hard. As does the memory of this great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps even good social satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the other reviews made me wonder if this is the type of movie only certain people like. I went to this movie with a group of my female friends expecting another annoying and boring romantic comedy. I personally didn't want to see it much because I deplore the values presented in so many movies, but the fact that I love Jude Law swayed me. I was very surprised to find that Alfie really isn't much of a romantic comedy. Yes, it is somewhat funny and it is about romance, but if you forced me to describe it I'd have to tag it with 'philosophical social satire.' No, I'm not tagging this as a substitute for Rousseau, but people familiar with satires might find it along the lines of Thackeray's Vanity Fair, Provost's Manon Lescaut, or Petroniu's Satyricon. Though admittedly not of the same caliber the themes of the emptiness of those immersed in 'immorality' and the innate human desire for satisfying relationships are portrayed admirably. I can call this satire though only of my own interpretations- in my opinion this movie ridicules Alfie's immoral lifestyle quite satirically. No matter what your interpretation, I don't see how this movie could be seen as glamorizing his lifestyle. Let me tell you that I was not laughing when I walked out of the theater and there were parts of this movie that made me shed tears. You don't need an appreciation of satire to enjoy this movie though- Law's acting is amazing and he's also gorgeous, the story interested most of my friends and I, and the cinematography is very chic. While it's by no means perfect, I think it deserves the 3.5/4 stars the Chicago Tribune gave it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfie is quite the ladies' man. However, this movie is no smooth operator. This movie was kinda rough. It wasn't that good. It was meh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written, directed and produced by Charles Shyer, and based on the 1966 British film of the same name which in return is adapted from a novel and play of the same name by Bill Naughton, this American remake tells the story of a single womanizing New York Limo Driver, named Alfie Elkins (Jude Law) whom is trying to change his Hedonism lifestyle, before its starts hurting the people, around him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this is one remake that shouldn't existed. After all, the original movie was made at a time, where a carefree existence was somewhat of a new thing &amp; then-taboo subject matter. So, it makes sense for Michael Caine's Alfie to be, somewhat of an unlikeable womanizer. He cheats on numerous women, and despite his confidence towards women, he treats them with disrespect and refers to them as "it", using them for sex and for domestic purposes. However, with Jude Law's version, he far too likable and charming than the 1966's version. He's too proper. He wasn't as much as a jerk and detached, as the original character is supposed to be. In many ways, this version of Alfie, seem less of a sexual predator than Michael Caine and more like a normal human being. So, for the most part, it made for a more enjoyable watch, than the original movie. However, it's not as memorable, as the first movie, as 1966's 'Alfie' was an edgy produce of the time. In 2004, it is far more common for men and women to sleep around, and also have a child outside the traditional rules; but in 1966, that was not common. Even the thoughts of abortion, is a no-no. I think that's the problem with this movie. It's not shocking anymore! Plus, there is barely any new stakes to modernize the dated source material. Honestly, the movie would had work better, if Alfie was more ass. Then, his fail redemption story would felt more tragic than it was. I didn't feel invested as I should. It wasn't engaging to me. It's a lot of first world Casanova conflicts that most people can't relate to. I would rather see him, deal with more modern day normal sexual problems, like STDs, complex sexual preferences, and time-management. Plus, as a comedy. This movie isn't that funny. Even the comical erectile dysfunction joke seem a bit limp. Also, the jokes are repetitive as hell. It doesn't have that, Woody Allen unique style, 'break the fourth wall' charm. It could had been a little clever in the way, it deliver that. Yet, it still has some cool moments in the beginning of the film, but for the most part, it wasn't anything new, toward the end. The 'break the fourth wall' pacing became to drag on, a little too much. Despite that, the supporting casting is well done. Marisa Tomei as Julie was amazing. You really hope for them to get together, even in the end. Susan Sarandon is a perfect fit for the rich MILF role that Shelley Winters used to bring, in the original movie. It also nice to see, some diversity, with African-American actors &amp; actresses, playing Alfie's best friend, Marlon (Omar Epps) and love-interest, Lonette (Nia Long). However, I didn't like the Asian roles like Wing (Gedde Watanabe) in this film. I found them to be a bit stereotypical, and somewhat offensive racist. If there were performance from the supporting cast, I didn't like; it would be, with Jude Law's then, real-life girlfriend, Sienna Miller as Nikki. I found her character to be minor with barely anything to show, besides lot of scenes of nudity. I know, her character was written that way so he miss Julie more, but it was highly disappointing. The whole montage sequence, kinda under-minded what she could had shown. Despite that, the movie is beautifully shot. Lots of bright colors to lighten the dark mood of the film. The music score composed by rock-star Mick Jagger, Dave Stewart and John Powell wasn't that bad, either. For the song "Old Habits Die Hard" Mick Jagger and David A. Stewart won the BFCA Award, the Golden Globe, a Sierra Award and the World Soundtrack. Yet it's nothing worth getting exciting about. It sounds like generic run of the mill, early 2000s rock music at the time. Nothing memorable. Further songs by Wyclef Jean and The Isley Brothers were the same. Overall: Hey Jude! You're a good actor, but this remake wasn't that good. At least, it is way better than 1975's sequel to the original movie, 'Alfie Darling' with Alan Price replacing Michael Caine. That movie was horrible. In the end, 2004's 'Alfie' was a box office bomb, not because it was bad. It was because of its mediocre. I really can't recommended watching it. It was a pointless watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable story of a likable rogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfie is a cocky Englishman enjoying his life in New York. Life seems good to him; he has a girlfriend but that doesn't stop him sleeping with other women who he dumps at the first sign that they want any sort of commitment. Then things start to go wrong; his girlfriend decides that she has had enough, he sleeps with his best friend's girlfriend then he finds that he can no longer perform in the way that matters most to him? in bed. This leaves him questioning his life style. He finds another girlfriend but the longer they are together the more he longs for somebody else; he then thinks he's found 'the one' only to learn that she has the same attitude to men that he had always had for women.I can't compare this to the original film as it is a long time since I watched that. Without that nagging comparison I found this to be an enjoyable film. Jude Law did a fine job as Alfie making him likable even though he is clearly a bit of a cad. I liked how most of the dialogue was aimed directly at the audience in a way that not only breaks the fourth wall it completely removes it. Some may consider the film to be somewhat misogynistic thanks to Alfie's one track mind when it comes to women; thankfully we see that attitude has consequences. The rest of the cast impresses too; most notably Sienna Miller and Susan Sarandon. Overall I found this to be rather fun although not a must see unless you are a Jude Law fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfie (2004): Dir: Charles Shyer / Cast: Jude Law, Marisa Tomei, Omar Epps, Nia Long, Susan Sarandon: Remake of the 1966 British film starring Michael Caine. This time Jude Law plays the title role as a limousine driver involved with numerous women for sexual conquests only to dump them when things become too close. Directed by Charles Shyer who is backed with fine location work and a charismatic performance by Law whose lifestyle seems free spirited until consequences hit a rather sour note. Marisa Tomei plays an ex girlfriend who is there to teach him some life lesson. Law regrets actions he took with her. Perhaps he feels guilt due to her sincerity, which is something he lacked in his flings. Omar Epps plays a co-worker who seeks Law's help in getting back together with his girlfriend, played by Nia Long but unfortunately it turns into an affair and Long becomes pregnant. It isn't difficult to predict how this situation turns out. Susan Sarandon makes a great cameo as an older woman whom Alfie becomes involved with. The performances are convicting with hints of humour throughout. Theme regards taking relationships for granted and how we can hurt others through senseless actions. While the conclusion bears lessons, it is somewhat unpleasant but Law's performance carries through bearing all convictions of broken relationships. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as good as the original, but it has its moments. The original Alfie was a visceral experience. You felt infuriated at his behaviour, yet laughed at it occasionally (at him, not with him). There was an edginess to it, as if it was going out of its way to annoy and offend you. Plus you had the superb performance of Michael Caine.This version is a lot less annoying, which is bad. Alfie's actions almost seem...normal and commonplace. His actions are certainly not being glorified, but they seem a lot less extreme.The new version does have its charms though. Jude Law is suitably suave and charming in the lead role. There is a swagger and big city sophistication to it. The soundtrack (mostly composed and performed by Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart) is great, and works very well with the movie.So, not as good as the original, but reasonably entertaining nonetheless.</fullReview>

Jude Law seems be the perfect Alfie. and that fact is essential. not for a credible lead character but for rhythm of film. for the pieces of a puzzle who, maybe not impressive, is charming. result - an easy story about selfish, love sense, sentimental conquest and real love search, few doses of cynicism and a hero of our period. entertainment, decent acting,smart options for cast and few drops of cinnamon. the good thing is the desire to not be part of competition with the original. Jude Law is not Michael Cain surrogate and the science to give his Alfie is a real virtue. not always convincing, in few scenes a kind of Puck, he has the opportunity to create a not bad sketch of adventurer - maybe the wise last part is not very inspired.short - a reasonable work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much flash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfie (Jude Law) is a womanizer limousine driver living in Manhattan. He is full of himself, and has several different girls on the go. Whether it's single mom Julie (Marisa Tomei) or best friend's girl Lonette (Nia Long), he can't help himself. It's not until Liz (Susan Sarandon) that he gets a taste of his own medicine. Is it possible for him to find true love with party girl Nikki (Sienna Miller)?This is a very shallow movie about a very shallow man. Instead of the brutality of Michael Caine's Alfie, we get a flashy Jude Law. Even the visual styling of those single word advertisements in the background gives a superficial flashy feel to the movie. Breaking down the 4th wall gives little more than Jude Law spewing out his shallow philosophy.It wallows too long in the shallow end of the pool. It's very repetitive. It's obvious that Alfie is getting his due rewards in the end, but it takes too long to get started. When he can't get it up, I don't know if we're suppose to be rooting for impotence. Alfie is too much of a cartoon. Even the final monologue isn't as deep as you may think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ALF is more friendly (web)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With A-lfie, i start to watch (and so review) my web movies. Just a note about the practice because the truth isn't exactly what you can hear. First, with the ticket price getting more and more expensive, movies lost their popular audience. Next, the copyright is actually perverted as art isn't for consumption (it's for enlighten) and culture must not become the next oil power all the more that its numeric nature makes it inexhaustible. In practice, to buy the DVD, you must find it and sometimes, it's impossible. When i tried online shopping, my packages were stolen and the post office wasn't totally white. As i'm deaf, i need subtitles and a lot of times, the subtitles are lacking, especially the french movies! At last, to watch a web movie on TV, it requires a lot of expertise as the TV, movies, subtitles must work all together. It asks for patience and time so it's not as simply as clicking on the mouse!About "Alfie" now, the movie got me mixed feelings: the idea of having a character interacts with the audience is very original, but to be great, the character should be interesting. Choosing a playboy bachelor played by Jude Law was not my cup of tea. Law is among my list of unbearable as he highly and irritatingly uses and abuses his good look. At least, it was the perfect pick for the part because Alfie has just the kind of life that exasperates me: it's empty, superficial, dishonest with only time for parties, drinking, getting stoned and catch as much babes as possible.On the other side, Alfie says true things about life: sometimes, you can do good but you are misinterpreted. Unexpected problems lurk always on your path, "uh-oh" attitudes exist in everyone but unlike the movie, we must prepare and not throw away the person. The best one was that a single mum can have accessories that can be irresistible: i knew this situation and i ended caring more for the kid than his difficult mother...If NYC was a good location to tell his story, it's a pity that the colors are quite ugly. Maybe the most silly moment was when he prefers to spend time with boring and old Sarandon instead of trying building something with cute and considerate Sienna. Dumping her on a cold rainy night and not helping with words or with her suitcases is the ultimate insult and i wonder if they really done the thing like this in their real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Star vehicle for the hot-and-smoldering-at-the-time Jude Law. "Alfie" is of course, a remake of the 60's movie starring Mchael Caine (who was just starting out). Doesn't really hold a candle to it, since the topics and sensibilities towards women have certainly changed, but Law and Company have a go at it, and it's pretty good, entertaining even. Jude Law certainly does have the acting chops, but Alfie does get tiring after awhile, with Alfie just riding to one girl adventure after another, learning about life along the way. The ending is a bit unsatisfactory though. Is Alfie happy? I thought he was learning about life and wanting to settle down. Oh well, that's Alfie for you I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfie follows the life of a young bachelor, going through women as if toilet paper, tossing them aside when done. Something soon causes him to change his ways. It's sexy, humorous...adorable even. A lighthearted story with a serious tone to it at the same time. Though he is quite the charmer, Alfie is not a character many can relate to. It focuses mainly on the fact that whoever Alfie comes into contact with, he ends up pushing away in some way ultimately ending up alone. The only thing that really holds the movie up is Jude Law's charismatic charm. If not that, it would probably falter more so. It does have it's many flaws but overall, I enjoyed the film. At times, it did feel dull, depressing and unnecessarily long. A story that could have moved faster but they stretched out to fit a certain time limit. Jude's charisma reels you in and holds you...to a certain point. Eventually becoming tiresome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philandering as a Lifestyle Option</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recent years have seen American remakes of three well-known British films from the early part of Michael Caine's career, "Alfie", "The Italian Job" and "Get Carter". (I understand that a remake of "Sleuth" is coming soon). These struck me as being a curious trio to remake because the originals were so rooted in a particular time and place, Britain in the late sixties and early seventies, that transferring them to twenty-first century America was always going to be risky, if not impossible. I have never seen the remade "Italian Job" (because, to be frank, I never liked the original much), but I have seen the Sylvester Stallone version of "Get Carter" (or "Get Rambo", as I prefer to think of it) and thought it a dreadful film, quite unworthy of comparison with its illustrious predecessor. As Caine's "Alfie" is, if anything, an even better film than his "Get Carter", it was with some trepidation that I watched the Jude Law version.The original film was set in what might be described as the kitchen sink end of swinging London. The remake moves the action to contemporary New York, (although much of it was shot in Manchester for financial reasons) but Alfie is still British, indeed still a Cockney, even though for American audiences Law's accent is somewhat toned down compared to Caine's. There are differences in the plots of the two films (although some elements are retained), but Alfie is still essentially the same.Like Caine, Law speaks straight into camera in a number of monologues which serve to give the audience a good idea of his character. He works as a limousine driver and finds that his job affords him plenty of opportunities to meet women. As in the original, he is a practised seducer, and among those he lures to his bed are lonely married woman Dorie, pretty single mum Julie, wealthy older woman Liz and Lonette, his best friend's girl whom he gets pregnant during a one-night stand. (These characters correspond roughly to Carla, Gilda, Ruby and Lily from the original film, although one notable difference is that Law sets his sights, socially speaking, rather higher than did Caine. Apart from Ruby, all Caine's conquests were working-class girls, whereas Law's are often from more privileged backgrounds).Law keeps closely to Caine's "cheeky chappie" interpretation of the character, always smiling and cheerful and endeavouring to look on the bright side of life. Cheerfulness can in some cases be an admirable attribute, but in Alfie's case it goes hand-in-hand with a crass insensitivity to the problems and emotions of others. What he wants out of life is commitment-free relationships which will enable him to find sexual satisfaction with as many women as possible. Only at the end of the film does it start to dawn on him that there might be more to life than a series of one-night stands, and he starts to ponder the question "What's it all about?" (Yes, that famous song makes another appearance). He realises that the women in his life have been giving whereas he has only been taking, and that his behaviour might have jeopardised his chances of finding more lasting happiness. A key scene (copied directly from the original film) comes when Alfie discovers that Liz has dumped him in favour of an even younger toyboy. For the first time he is being used in the way he uses others, and he doesn't like it.Law does a good job with the difficult task of interpreting a character made famous by another actor, and overall this is a reasonably good film, certainly far better than "Get Rambo". Yet overall it seems to lack something that Lewis Gilbert's version had, and I think that there are two reasons for this. The first is that, somewhat surprisingly, it is less frank in its approach to sexual matters, even though visually the love scenes are more explicit than anything in the original. The most moving scene in the 1966 film was the one where, after Alfie has bullied the pregnant Lily into having an illegal abortion, he is shocked by the sight of his dead unborn child. There is no parallel scene in this film as the equivalent character, Lonette, opts to keep her child, even though its mixed race will reveal to her boyfriend (both he and she are black) that he is not the father. It seems that to succeed in America a film must avoid offending either the pro-choice or pro-life camps, so the topic of abortion is tactfully avoided.The second reason is one I alluded to earlier. Gilbert's film was firmly rooted in the working-class London in the mid-sixties, and reflects the Zeitgeist of that period. It was a time when the Pill was a recent invention, when the sexual revolution was just beginning but when older, conservative, attitudes towards sex were stronger than they are today. Although Caine's Alfie manages to seduce a number of women, all his victims, except the blowsy, tarty Ruby, are basically old-fashioned girls looking for love rather than sex, and he is smart enough to know this and cynical enough to exploit it.Today, forty years on, attitudes towards sex are rather different. The sexual revolution, like all successful revolutions, has become the new orthodoxy, and we are no longer shocked by the idea that women as well as men can engage in casual recreational sex. Following the arrival of AIDS, this type of sex may be regarded as literally unhealthy, but fewer people, unless they have deep religious convictions, would regard it as morally so. Alfie's story today does not have the impact it had in the sixties. In the original film, Alfie's philandering seemed like a deep-seated character flaw; in the remake it is, at the most, an unwise lifestyle option. The remake is a stylish and watchable film, but it lacks the tragic seriousness of Gilbert's. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiously interesting, ultimately satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into Alfie expecting to see a light comedy and came out seeing a somewhat introspective commentary. Throughout the film, I questioned myself: Where is this going? What is the director trying to say? Ultimately, these questions are somewhat answered, which is good enough for the sort of film it is. Beginning as a light situational gentlemen's comedy about a womanizing London bloke in Manhattan, Alfie ends up with the main character being a victim of his own crimes, and we learn something about him and something about ourselves at the same time. Alfie's serendipitous life is quite endearing through the eyes of a charming Jude Law, however an intense emotional soundtrack and a sentimental supporting cast gives a sort of disconnect with Alfie, as we see him as ultimately a person who deserves what he gets. This beckons the question: should we feel sorry for Alfie or should we feel good that this "player" got what he had coming? Ultimately this leaves a whole that is not filled, but gives us leaving the theater with something to talk about. With a wonderfully expressive facial performance by Jude Law (check out the frame pauses throughout the film and the way he looks) and excellent supporting cast of veterans like Susan Sarandon (along with Omar Epps, Nia Long, Marissa Tomei, and others), Alfie is a film that is well worth a water-cooler conversation but not worth a dinner debate.</fullReview>

Therefore, I have nothing to compare this movie with. However, I enjoyed it. It was slightly more exceptional than most movies about relationships because of Jude Law. He adds a depth that only a person can with real talent. He is surrounded by a good cast that also puts in good performances: Susan Sarandon, Sienna Miller, Nia Long, Jane Krakowski, and Marisa Tomei. The unexpected thing about this movie to me wasn't that it was necessarily just a man's movie. It was also very much a movie about friendships and women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The point isn't that it's a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm not quite old enough to have seen the original at the movies, I have seen it several times and feel I was influenced by watching it while growing up, probably because for the most part I wanted to be like Alfie. I admit that I only went to see the remake to confirm my suspicions - that it wouldn't be a patch on Caine's version. I was curious to see how the crucial aspects in the first film could be recreated or reinterpreted in this version. For instance, there's the subplot where Alfie is sent to a clinic in the country to recuperate after a health scare. Now, there's no way anyone today would believe the National Health has clinics in the country where they send blue collar workers for a spell of country air and a lie down. There was also the back street abortion to contend with, which so affected Alfie in the original. Surely, any attempt to weave the same tale in 2004 would end in failure! But that's not what happened. It was fantastic. I think it works well as both a remake and a movie in its own right. If you see the original first and then watch the remake you'll feel like you've seen the same movie, which as a great director once said 'that's what everyone wants from a sequel'. Not that this is a sequel, but it could have been, it would have worked almost as well as Alfie 2: son of Alfie... The clever tricks used to recreate the feel of London in the 60s works really well, like the pencil thin ties Alfie wears, the proliferation of mini-skirts and funky hats, as well as some 'wild' camera work.I'm not sure about the subliminal messages though, I'm not sure they were in the first film (perhaps that's a good sign that they were!) and I'm not sure why they're used here, but it didn't detract from the quality.Jude's 'to camera' deliveries were well performed, particularly the last, which if memory serve is exactly the same ? word for word ? as Caine's last little speech in the original. I think Caine's reputation has made the original Alfie a classic as much as the film itself, to say there couldn't be a remake as good as the first is clearly a reaction to the idea that there could ever be another Caine. Law isn't, but he doesn't need to be. The character is larger than both of them, which is why the story worked then and works now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worthy to fill Sir Michael's Italian loafers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Western culture is a serpent eating its own tail, it follows that it will eventually choke on its own feces.Put simply: the original version of Alfie was a Snake Feast. The watery, transparent 2004 Alfie, another redundant remake from the Selected Works of Sir Michael Bleedin' Caine, is Snake Sh*t.One of the British box office hits of 1965, Alfie is a snapshot from a moment in history, a perfectly framed view of the Sexual Revolution from a working class perspective. It was both a highbrow sex farce and a populist kitchen sink drama with some wry observations about social class and convention thrown in, all held together by the magnetic presence of its star on the rise. Alfie's like a timeless character from Thackary who spends more than half his screen time justifying his appallingly rakish behavior to the audience; a vain, cocky yet insecure and neurotic Lothario attempting to escape responsibility and pain through a series of doomed sexual misadventures. He emerges at the end of the film unrepentant and only a little wiser, turning to the camera with the immortal tag-line "Wossit all abaht?" It's that timelessness the makers of Alfie '04 attempt to capitalize on in their grotesque carbon copy, updating its East End setting to lower Manhattan but with the female archetypes - or "birds" - left intact. There's the doormat girlfriend, the frustrated wife, and Susan Sarandon updates Shelly Winters' loud, vulgar 50-something man-eater as a slightly more classy 2004 model. A pointed comment on the eternal sexual condition? More like an industry that's fat, indolent, and believes the general public have a long-term memory no longer than six months. One can only imagine its audience are cocktail-guzzling Manhattan matrons with a yen for all things British, like Bridget Jones or Sarah Ferguson, and Jude Law's posterior. True, there are more shots of Law as Alfie "on the job" as it were, but those are mighty big shoes he's walking in. Jude Law comes across affable and worldly and tosses in the odd Caine-ism, but on final judgment is a pale streak of snake sh*t not worthy to fill Sir Michael's Italian loafers.Maybe that's the problem. Caine's Alfie is cold, calculating, and at times utterly repellent. One dubious conquest he refers to as "it" is set to work as his personal slave, and then cast off for showing too much affection. Alfie '04 attempts to sanitize him, sand off some of the uncomfortable un-PC angles. Alfie 65's moment of truth arrives when the dumpy middle-aged wife of his hospital chum asks Alfie for a backyard abortion (Alfie only slept with her, mind you, to help his lunch go down). As he stares down at his miniature reflection, Caine's face is a contorted mask of pure sorrow. Law's moment of truth in Alfie '04 - no plot spoilers here - is so wide of the mark it's an insult. Strip the character of his tics and grimaces and cutesy cockney patter, and ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Invisible Man.Even more offensive is the use of 60s pop art icons to evoke the original's aura of cool. A Chet Baker poster, Alfie's scooter - in fact the entire coke-smeared, boots and fur coated, Nico-meets-Julie Christie coquetry of the Nikki character, played by Sienna Miller. The Clash once sang "No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977" and the same can be said about Alfie. That Golden Age of popular cinema in the Sixties could actually be about experimenting with style and breaking cultural taboos; not so in 2005, where surface passes for style, smarminess is a stand-in for genuine wit, where sh*t is champagne and sacred ground is something for film industry Burkes and Hares to plunder at will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfie is a very good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the movie, Alfie, several times and love it! The movie should be watched without constantly comparing it to the original with Michael Caine. Jude Law and the rest of the cast made an outstanding movie. I like the fact that it takes place in modern day Manhattan. The whole movie flows from the opening scene of Alfie's apartment to the end shot of him tossing flowers into the water. It is a remake and it is updated and it was done successfully so. The soundtrack is Fantastic! The photography of the movie mixed with Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart's genius soundtrack add up to a feast for the senses. I think this movie gets a bad rap, but I think it's great on its own. No apologies needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fine performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is bound to be compared to the original.We all know that the movie is about a young man, a real chick magnet that women find irresistible. Alfie is a cad, he is meant to be a lovable cad and he is a young man afraid of commitment. The original dealt with several issues and the new version does side step a few issues. I felt aids needed some mention. The old Alfie did not have that to contend with.The world then was concerned with abortion but today, abortion is generally seen as a woman's right. Its true there are a few nut cases who for quaint reasons still oppose abortion as a woman's choice but generally we see them as stodgy old conservatives.Quaint but quite silly. Still it was a hot topic back then. There is one thing in this movie that makes it work. Jude Law is perfect. It is quite simply an outstanding performance. The cheeky chats to the camera, the charm and the masculinity of Alfie is wonderful. I always found Michael Caines Alfie very dull, pallid and even rather effeminate. Caine looked like a pasty pom who had never seen the light of day, let alone a street fight.His working class ethic was simply phoney. Law beats him hands down! Law is all man. Albeit, cheeky man. There are wonderful new scenes such as the chat in the toilets with the old man who can't piddle. A stark message to Alfie of the world ahead. Alfie never means to hurt any one but he does. I preferred the women in the original film, especially Shelly Winters but the original had one essential ingredient missing, Mr Law. Jude Law, who gives a faultless, restrained performance. It was hard to understand why women swooned over Michael Caine. When you watch Jude Law you cant help thinking, who wouldn't?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie But Hard To Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sometimes hard to separate the subject matter and the tone of a movie from an more impartial evaluation of a movie. Back in the sixties, when the original version came out, the frollicking, free-sex times allowed for a more somber look at an age of itself, but in today's more conservative, ambivalent times, a remake of a playboy is not as easy to digest and suffer through because not as many people are supposedly partaking or if they do they already are having to make do with the current morality of the times. Thus, when looking at this remake, it is possible to say that Jude Law does a credible job, the self-narrative is fun and cute for its relatively novelty in this time period of the last couple decades. The movie is really a good look of the transformation and a cautionary tale that is ripe for discussion among both men and women, particularly however men (most whom of course would probably be wanting to go see something else).The movie is well-paced, the separate encounters given good exposure, the thread of the plots understanding. It is the European spiral into the more operatic themes of gloom and doom that is difficult to judge and to avoid casting a more negative rating because of it. The scene with Susan Sarandon is a real treat of reality. This movie has a good story and has substantive issues for qualitative thought such as a good movie is supposed to do whether or not we actually like what it is trying to tell us. Eight out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfie on Crack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another from the 'why bother' school of filming. Take a brilliant movie,one of the best of all time and hack it to bits. Don't bother writing any decent lines, take out all the sex ( the average episode of the anodyne Sex in The City has more humping than this ! ) miscast everyone, oh....and transplant the action to 21st Century New York for no apparent reason. Perhaps it was cheaper than location work in London ? Jude Law looked like a scruff as his single suit became more battered with each scene. Somehow Caine always seemed cheeky and dishabille in the original. Instead of TB our hero gets some kind of penile cancer. Enter a gay German doctor straight out of The League of Gentlemen. Then he makes friends with some old guy in the toilets. Like you do. Not......! ( this pointless character was not in the original so why bother ? )Then the cancer magically disappears. Perhaps the cancer was caused by the endless cigarettes everyone smoked. Who sponsored this film ? Phillip Morris ? The black girl even smoked while having intercourse - never mind before or after it ! What where the words written on hoardings supposed to be ? My wife and I could think of many others they could have used. Like WHY ? ; RUBBISH !; and AGH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What it's All About</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILERS:I saw 'Alfie' weeks before it opened and wasn't going to comment on it. As a single Manhattanite in my early 30's (and a bit of a wanna-be amateur womanizer), I found it engaging, fascinating, sometimes uplifting and ultimately very real. I just assumed it would get great buzz and open very well. I was subsequently shocked by the mixed reviews because my compass is generally pretty good when it comes to predicting audience reaction -- had I seen a different movie?Then I realized, I had . . from a certain point of view. I unwittingly empathized with Alfie's failed efforts to obtain personal fulfillment through female 'conquests' and recognized the pitfalls and risks of Alfie's behavior. But, as in most cases, by the time you understand that trusting someone can bring happiness, the opportunity to do so could be gone.Jude Law is fantastic as Alfie. He is charismatic, handsome and tips his hand to the audience JUST enough to keep from being smarmy. Law assures us that Alfie is essentially a good person with simple wants, but he is clueless as to the tremendous impact his actions have on those around him. Because of this blindness, he carelessly romps through life, casting aside all reason and consequence so he can enjoy each moment free of guilt or worry.Of course, the bubble can only get so big before it bursts. Alfie's brushes with testicular cancer, abortion, betrayal and true love finally force him to confront, and question, the way he lives his life. What is it all about? Alfie asks the question that never gets answered. But I think we are meant to infer from everything Alfie goes through, that life is about whatever we want it to be. The trick is deciding what that is, before it is too late.Remake? WHO CARES?? Through my eyes, a nearly perfect film. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About "Trivia" and how stupid this movie idea is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a comment to make about the "Trivia" section about "Alfie." Where the resident of England was shooting on a video camera-footage outside his window when they made the movie there. And the director said the guy should be sued.Well- did anyone think that maybe the director should be sued, or the people who "dug up" this classic movie and pretended it was never made. Did anyone ask "Burt Bacharach" if they could use his theme song or rather rip it off?I get so disgruntled year after year now- of the yuppie stuff from Hollywood- remake this, remake that- I imagine it is only to target someone who is younger than 30 and won't remember that Michael Caine was in the movie in 1966. Everything they say about the 1966 Alfie on TV is so mean. And that really upsets me to no end. Today I saw a behind the scenes look at "Alfie" the ripoff. If anyone need suing- it is "all" the Hollywood people who think they can REMAKE classics of any kind. And to even have someone else sing the theme song, how sacrilegious is the world now? If I were Michael Caine-the original actor, Dionne Warwicke-the original theme singer, and of course the brilliant-song writer Burt Bacharach- I would be very angry right about now. From being slapped in the face by the film makers for recognizing the PAST as nothing. I even heard a generation "X" actor on behind the scenes who said that Michael Caines character was too harsh. Well, excuse me- did anyone bother to realize that is the reason you remake a film, because it is supposed to be close to the original? Duh. This same kind of stupid craze came out with Planet of the Apes.They said- " Oh this has nothing to do with the Charleton Heston film". Yeh,sure. Give credit where credit is due. Don't slam the past, at least recognize it and give it stature. I sit and wonder-God only knows what they will remake and mess up next. I could go on and on- this past 2 years has been nothing but ripoff remake. "Willard,Bourne Identity,Alfie,Freaky Friday ( for the 3rd damn time!). Can't someone make a movie that is not a remake? Hollywood should leave our generation alone and in tact with the movies and make up something new! This Alfie was a waste of time. I was not born last night, all these movies will appeal to the people who have no idea that there was an original.The young people. And in the end that only makes money,money,money. I think it is defacing something wonderful by reaching back and grabbing hit movies from the past.I fight back by not going to see these remakes, because I know they will be garbage. Every one I have seen or heard about has been that way. Let's get real - They sliced up the Exorcist a hundred different ways. Give me another break. Unless you were 12,13,14 years old and sitting in the theater seeing- The Exorcist,Jaws,Towering Inferno, Poseiden Adventure,or any of the other great ORIGINAL movies of the 1970's and 1960's-then keep your self in the 2004 seat and make up something NEW!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfie - More than a cad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's it all about? That is the question that art tries to answer, whatever form it may be. Sometimes, like Alife, they come right out and tells us this is the intent. It is often those more subtle ones that fail anyway. Therefore, it was a smart choice to have Alfie narrate his story directly to the audience. This lets everyone breath easier because everything is put out there on the table for you to do what you will with it.Based on the movie Alfie, which is based on the play Alfie, this new version, unoriginally titled Alfie, is the story of a cad who, of course, experiences a change of heart. Yeah, I know, cliché is the word here. Alfie is a cousin of the Romantic Comedy genre but because it is a one-man show, he can't quite be allowed into the club. But that's okay. Romantic Comedies are for women and Alfie, although still a chick-flick is appealing to men because a) they can relate and b) there is plethora (one of Alfie's daily vocab words) of young, attractive, scantily clothed women.Jude Law is experiencing over-exposure this year. He is in six movies all to be released basically back to back. Unfortunately, none have brought the box office gold that someone of his looks might be expected to draw in. However, like so much else in this world, indicators such as this can be misleading. In Alfie, Law shows once again his versatility with character. He is all over the map while still being Alfie. You see him in so many states that might have been passed over by another. Law has shown before that he is not afraid to let go, as so many are. With two (!!) Oscar nominations under his belt, it is not unconceivable, although probably not possible, that he could wined up with another this year, maybe for Alfie.Sometimes a film tries to do too much. Sometimes a film tries to do too little. It is hard to strike the right balance between the two. Most movies of the genre Alfie pretends to belong to, try for too little. They think that a big name star can carry them farther than something scratched just under the surface. Believe it or not, audiences like leaving the theater knowing they saw a movie that had more to it than they could understand. It makes them feel intellectual. This explains the appeal of the matrix. It has what everyone wants ? tight leather, action, guns etc. ? but it also has a glimmer, real or not, of a subtext. Alfie never actually dives into its subtext (This is good. You don't want the audience to walk away feeling stupid.) but hints at it. Giant bill-boards mark different passages of Alfie's journey, never really explaining themselves, but suggesting something more than the superficial surface most RomComs give.So, what's it all about? Well, you'll have to see the movie first, but I can guarantee that they don't want you don't want to know. They'd be out of a job if we figured it out. ***1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as feared...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great thing about being dragged to see films that you don't really want to see, is that when they turn out to be OK then you end up leaving the theatre feeling semi satisfied. And that is exactly what this remake of the 60's Michael Caine film is, OK. Caine purists have moaned that the film itself doesn't bear up well against the original, that it isn't as gritty or in some ways, seedy as its predecessor and that anything with Law in it is just style over substance. What we actually get is a poorly directed, shoddily edited, mildly entertaining popcorn flick, which IS style over substance.Law gives a decent and somewhat infectious performance as lovable, mockney Alfie, further staking his claim towards the best do hair in the world award. There is also decent support from Omar Epps as Alfie's cheated on best mate Marlon and Susan Sarandon looking not a day over 40.The main problem I found with the film was the blatant over directing and editing of certain scenes, especially those that involved emotion. The scene where Law is dumped by his girlfriend (Marisa Tomei) is a prime example, instead of getting what could have been a moving insight of the mind of our protagonist, we get a scene which is about 5 or 6 takes botched together, which drains any feeling there might have been altogether. Did Shyer have trouble getting actors to act? Should he stick to Steve Martin wedding films?All in all this is 21st century, times have changed since 1966, women are no longer men's toys like they were back then, peoples attitudes to sex, abortion, and social comment are all different compared with 40 years ago and this is reflected in here.Alfie isn't bad, it is just OK, and if you are forced into it, then probably all the better for enjoyment purposes. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's it all about? Disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tagline for the new film 'Alfie' ask us, what's it all about? The answer, unfortunately, is that it's about sheer disappointment. The film focuses solely on Alfie Elkins, a swinging young womanizer packed with style and a charm that could only be British. After an all too brief introduction to our protagonist and his long list of lady-friends, some kind of plot begins to develop ? sort of. We move through far too many completely unrelated situations, all of which only have any relevance at all because of their connection to our main character. The film does almost nothing to stay focused on a character or situation long enough to develop anything genuine; one minute we have the beginnings of a story with one girl, the next minute we're on to something completely different. You may hope that the film returns to these unfinished story arcs, but it rarely does. And those special times when the story comes back to something that was left unfinished, the film manages to once again leave the story too quickly, adding further loose ends and unresolved issues.This episodic structure does give the film a pace that is representational of Alfie's dating life ? constantly moving from one thing to another, never letting anything unfold ? but this does not work to the advantage of the film. Rather than giving it an interesting structure that parallels the story, it creates confusion and disorientation, and even worse than that ? a loss of the empathy for the characters that would be present if the film took the time to develop characters and stories properly. In fact, just about everything in the film lacks conviction, particularly in the places where it is needed the most; moments that should provoke emotion tend to leave the audience wanting something more substantial, which once again is an issue with the film's poor use of development.If it weren't for Jude Law's charming performance as Alfie Elkins, the film would collapse entirely under its own poor craft. Of course, this is not at all to say that Law saves the film; he does nothing of the sort. His performance, strong as always, just happens to stop the film from being a complete waste of time. His energy is strong and his talent is clear, but it is not enough to bring the film to that next level of quality.The photography and cinematography, while positively beautiful at times, is staggeringly inconsistent and often not at all fitting to the film's needs. Portions of the film are very nicely photographed, which almost seems like a waste of talent. A spiffy paint job on a car may be appealing to the eye, but why even bother if the car doesn't have an engine? This is precisely what Alfie is all about: some nice looks and a fairly strong performance, but sadly there is no engine to be found.</fullReview>

The film is so ill conceived that I'm not even going to talk about it, but I'm going to talk about Jude Law because I love him. I'm also considerably older than him and I love movies and great actors and on the screen, great actors can also be great stars and when great stars are also great actors then you have Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Daniel Day Lewis even Sean Penn and a few others. Jude Law had, from day one (a few days ago) all the elements that made the above mentioned actors what they were, what they are, what they always will be. I'm not about blame the failure of this film on Jude Law, no, of course not but "Alfie" comes out on a year when we've had several Jude Law movies all of them bearing Jude Law's name, but just the name. Not a glimpse of the Law of Mr Ripley or Wilde not even Gattaca. In "Closer" he is very good but he couldn't afford not to be. Great words and Mike Nichols. No, I want to see Jude Law in dangerous projects with unpredictable, brilliant, lyrical, powerful directors. I want to see him in all his glorious promise. Is that too much to ask?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of a scumbag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no other way to describe this person, Alfie. A Brit ex-pat who finds his way to one of the major urban hubs in the US, and goes about bedding women without rhyme or reason as to what he's doing, nor why he's doing it. Other than he likes what he does regardless of how anybody else feels. Truly self centered.But how does a person operate like this? Some are sociopaths. They've got that reptilian thing going on to reproduce, and have the intellect of a human mind that allows them to fixate and interact with mainstream society, but without regards as to how others feel. It's not a disease so much as a default in the neurological makeup of a particular type of human mind.But, let's suppose Alfie in this film is a normal human being. Then how is it that he's able to jump from bed to bed to bed without remorse or second thought as to whom is getting hurt in the process. How does it work? We're not really sure, other than Alfie is incapable of seeing past the bridge of his nose where his interests and other people's feelings are concerned. If this is the case, and Alfie realizes his faults after he's utterly betrayed so many friends and potential soul mates for the sake of a nights pleasure, then he truly is a scumbag. One might call him a type of human being that is incapable of existence. That is it almost seems impossible to conceive of a human being, truly and fully functional, one capable of empathy, acting the way the main character does in this story. I mean, it can't happen, right? But hey, it's Hollywood, so we give it a pass. Instead of questioning the plausibility of the scenario, we allow the films production values (outstanding in this case) to shine and wash over us. We take in Jude Law's performance as he cavorts with the opposite sex, and for a brief moment almost desire the life he has. But this is a parable about consequences, not one about male fantasies. Yet even parables fall into the realm of fantasy, as reality for real "Alfies" falls into a deep shade of gray as to their ultimate fate, and as to whether or not they learned a lesson from their foibles.I'm not a fan of the film, but I like it as a film. I think it's exceptionally well shot, well staged, and particularly well acted. It's a story regarding an element of society that allows their loins to dictate their actions and ultimate psychology, with perhaps a subconscious notion that if only people would see things their way, then it would be a whole lot better world. Untrue of course. Regardless of our deepest erotic fantasies, what really guides us is our desire for common decency and a degree of respect for our thoughts, feelings and relationships. But this seems to be beyond Alfie's capability.Truth be told I knew an "Alfie" at one time (not me) who led pretty much the life this Alfie led, right down to betraying his best friend in exact same way as depicted in the film (again, not me, but I knew the parties involved). I wondered if that person ever learned a lesson like Alfie. Probably not.If I had one complaint about this film, and I'm not sure that I do, it's that there's little in the way of a Greek chorus, or a close friend acting as such, telling us Alfie's ultimate fate. That's perhaps too didactic, but it almost felt like the film needed that. I also felt the film needed to be accessible to younger viewers. The language and sex scenes prohibit this, but in our day and age it seems to me that young people need this kind of warning.I suppose the big question is this; will Alfie ever change? One doubts it. But then again the film doesn't present any afterword. We have to decide for ourself what Alfie makes of his world.An interesting watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy Fulfillment Time for Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a clever little film, intricately designed to appeal, I think, to certain women. It works so well on so many levels as a chick flick that one is left wondering, at the end, why it was so uninspiring even on that level. But, for me at least, that was the bottom line - a gorgeous film, full of gorgeous models, that ultimately caters only to the eyes and not the head.Jude Law is magnificent, perfectly cast (for the burden placed on him here, at least) as the ultimate chick magnet. Boyish, winning smile, perfectly composed at all times, handsome as a male model. His menial job doesn't matter in this fantasy world, all that counts are his classically good looks, that's his ticket. A very stereotypically feminine sensibility, if you will, as I don't think many of us know of men in our own lives who can get along like that - that is more a given of the female of the species. You almost half believe, while he rides around (beautifully shot) Manhattan on his adorable little moped, that female models actually do compose the entire sidewalk population. Naturally, they have nothing else to do but turn from whatever they are doing so they can gaze on Alfie's awesomeness. Here's a thought - put a female model on a cute little moped cruising Manhattan and that might actually be realistic.Which leads me to my main point. The whole thrust of this film is that Alfie is meant to be seen from a womanly perspective. It is the female gaze they are pandering to, not the standard male gaze. That's the trick - switch everyone's gender, and suddenly the light switches on. The women in the audience are meant to put themselves in Alfie's shoes. Once that is accomplished, the whole thing makes perfect sense and serves as a Nice Moral Lesson.Well, for sure. But the picture only gets lovelier. Alfie lives for women, and serves as their no-questions-asked lover of the moment. He fatally supposes that romance/sex/love has no consequences, but - egad, shocker! - it does. Dropping women like flies after seducing them eventually catches up with him. Oh, my! So, we have the perfect set-up to comfort every woman: Mr. Irresistible who callously breaks hearts before breakfast is actually weak like everyone else, and has feelings, and is susceptible to emotional dramas and manipulations. Well, ladies, we can't leave him blissful in his cruel ignorance! The film becomes a meditation on the comeuppance of somebody who is aggressively shallow, and whose fatal crime is that he knows how shallow he is the whole time and Just Doesn't Care. Criminal serial feelings offender! It's all about the emotions, baby. Hurt peoples' feelings and you will rue the day.Alfie takes his "girlfriend" for granted and loses her - and when of course he realizes how much he needed her, it's too late, she's with someone else who is just simply to die for. Isn't this every "mistreated" woman's fantasy? Heartlessly dump another one who's not worthy - and she summarizes his character a little too perfectly as she plays the martyr and pathetically leaves in the cold and rain (you better feel guilty now, boy!). His fantasy figure turns out to be a sophisticated much older woman (cough cough audience fantasy fulfillment cough cough), but she serves up to him what he had been serving up to others - wow, couldn't see THAT one coming. The big twist(s) at the end is hardly worth the wait, but perhaps some will see this as "deep." If so, it would be the only such moment in the film. "I took advantage of women and didn't give, only took, and that is a bad thing which leaves me a fancy-pants loser" - what Solomonic wisdom.At heart, the moral of the film - if you want to dignify it as such - is that drifting through life as if it were a fast-food meal ultimately is unsatisfying. Fair enough. But the character of Alfie becomes uneven, set up as so insightful, perceptive and knowledgeable about so many things relating to women and relationships in order to seduce them, yet ultimately blind to the perfectly obvious consequences of his dark designs. Making the cultured Alfie appear simplistic at the end when he needs to be because finally he is on the receiving end is done in grotesquely ham-handed fashion. Suddenly, Alfie is shown to be so uneducated that he never learned how to pronounce the word "Aphrodite." Oh, you poor, uncouth loser. The perceptive fellow who has been giving us the (eventually tedious) running monologue throughout the film, shading delicate situations with extreme subtlety while he spins his evil (from a female perspective, natch) little webs turns out to be our inferior, hopelessly beneath us! Yay, now burn him at the stake!It was a nice touch having Mick Jagger do the score. Someone behind the scenes had a good chuckle about that. Hope you didn't sprain your wrist patting yourself on the back! Hey, he sang backup on "You're So Vain," too, so this isn't the first time. If you want obvious, well, this will hit the spot.I didn't like the film. It said nothing to me, can you guess? But it may make you feel good for a spell, waiting for little Mr. I'm So Vain to get it in the end (no, not THAT way). The saving grace is that "Alfie" is so full of beautiful people, and things, and situations that it is easy on the eyes. Plus, it doesn't require any thought, everything is s-p-e-l-l-e-d o-u-t for you. You know, like A-p-h-r-o-d-i-t-e. Burger and fries with a diet coke! So, if you like Jude Law and all that jazz, well, give this one a whirl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moving from Britain to Manhattan, dashing Jude Law (as Alfie Elkins) begins to sample a variety of New York's finest women. He's got sweet 'n' pretty Marisa Tomei (as Julie) serving as girlfriend while continuing "one night stands" and other affairs. Since Mr. Law won't commit, Ms. Tomei wants a more stable mate. To replace her, Law shacks up with smokin' Sienna Miller (as Nikki), who goes topless for the camera. But, sexy Susan Sarandon (as Liz) also commands Law's attention; she likes younger men. And, Law gives luscious Nia Long (as Lonette) a whirl on the pool table, even though she's best friend Omar Epps (as Marlon)'s fiancée.Director Charles Shyer's "Alfie" is a great looking film, with wonderful cinematography by Ashley Rowe and editing by Padraic McKinley. Mick Jagger sings the appropriate "Old Habits Die Hard". Much of the film is pure eye candy - not only the sexy cast, but also scenes like the beautifully lighted street Law walks down after receiving good news from the doctor. Watch for it after Law splashes in some rain puddles. Still, the story is a little lame, considering how times have changed since Michael Caine's original "Alfie" (1966). Herein, Law gets "E.D.", and a feminine doctor is able to get it up again. What's that all about, Alfie? ****** Alfie (10/22/04) Charles Shyer ~ Jude Law, Marisa Tomei, Sienna Miller, Susan Sarandon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cherish the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHAT'S it all about, indeed? Just why did anyone think Lewis Gilbert's classic 1966 comedy needed the remake treatment? Are there young whippersnappers out there who won't watch anything made prior to Star Wars?Probably. There's an old joke that sums up this modernised revamp of Bill Naughton's original stage play about a womanising chauffeur quite well. This guy goes into hospital for a gall bladder operation. When he wakes up the surgeon says: 'I've got good news and bad news. The bad news is that when I was operating I sneezed and I accidentally cut your penis off.' This understandably perturbs the patient. 'What on earth is the good news?' he says, horrified. 'Well,' the doctor says 'we ran a biopsy on it and it's benign!' This is the 2004 model of Alfie in a nutshell - rather emasculated, but essentially harmless. The shocking thrill of the original is in its' appalling attitudes to women. Michael Caine, the first (an let's make no bones about it, timeless) Alfie referred to his conquests as 'it' and wandered from bedroom to bedroom with the abandon of a likable sociopath. And that was the truly horrifying thing Alfie was likable ? he was funny, frank and kept drawing you into his confidence by directly addressing the camera. Best of all he was played by Michael Caine. Blokes love Caine because he was never particularly good looking (nothing to be jealous of) and he let himself get tubby yet still got to play football with Pele in Escape To Victory. What a guy! Alfie here is Jude Law who is at 31 probably a better actor than Caine was at that age and is, certainly, better looking than most men on the planet. Law, naturally, appeals to women more than men and his Alfie has been ? somewhat unnecessarily ? feminised, which rather misses the point, don't you think? First of all law habitually wears a pink shirt. 'If you ooze masculinity, like some of us do, there's no reason to fear pink?' the new Alfie confides. In 1985 that was true but I wouldn't go running to M&amp;S just yet, lads. Even the credits are in pink! What's going on? Law's Alfie also would never dream of referring to women as 'it' and is blessed with bags of charm and an effortless grin while Caine's was pretty uncommunicative and curt ? with the ladies anyway. He spoke to the camera because he couldn't enter into a meaningful dialogue with any woman. Caine was just talking to them men in the audience and women had the thrill of eavesdropping. If you've never seen the original with a woman who's managed to reach her thirties without seeing it then please do ? the gasps of shock and awe are highly entertaining. Law, you feel is addressing everyone ? director Charles Shyer is obviously running scared of alienating 50 per cent of his audience. Eager to hit every target demographic in the book Shyer relocates the story from London to New York. This is hardly heresy since Alfie is a story about people, not places, and there are loads of British chancers working in the Big Apple. The only thing is there's almost no sense of place, the film could have been shot in Toronto or Chicago and Alfie with his English accent now becomes an alien, exceptional character rather than an everyman. The abortion scene ? the original's strongest moment ? is also fudged. Actually it's turned into something rather different. Reality does intrude on Alfie's Lothario lifestyle but it's never a particularly harsh reality so it's hardly the powerful emotional journey that the first film took us on. When Caine's Alfie had medical problems it was suspected cancer, when Law goes it's for erectile dysfunction. Everything about the remake is softened While you could keep on making unflattering comparisons 'til the cows came home there's still a deal to admire in Alfie. Anyone who's had to suffer through Wimbledon or Bride And Prejudice should welcome a romantic comedy drama that at least bears some resemblance to real life. Happily, feminising the source material means that Alfie's 'birds' make for a more interesting aviary than the 1966 selection. Susan Sarandon gets the Shelley Winters part as the older lady though, sadly, Law never gets to utter the immortal line: 'She's in lahvely condition'. Marisa Tomei turns the frustratingly placid Julia Foster role into something rather more touching. Quite unexpectedly, Law's current squeeze Sienna Miller, is excellent as Nikki, a manic-depressive party girl. This relationship, which has no precedent in the original, is the best thing about the new Alfie. It's raggy road to inevitable failure shows that law's Alfie has at least tried to commit to a relationship and it shows how the nightmare scenario of co-habiting with with the wrong woman gives him an 'excuse' to continue with the serial shagging. Adulterers, like murderers, always need an excuse.It's a nice touch in a nice film but there's nothing 'nice' about the original. That's why it's a classic and this is merely good ? but still, a bit pointless. Cherish the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is very nicely shot and well acted. But I could not help wonder what inspired the remake at all. The 1966 film had social relevance. In 2004, it seemed like an exercise in 'prettifying' the original. It is pretty, pointless, and ultimately pretty pointless.Having said that much, the film carries a pleasant soundtrack and the performance of Sarandon is quite marvelous. If you have not seen the original film then you may gain some enjoyment from this film. If you expect an entertaining story you will be disappointed. It is well crafted but little more than an empty exercise. The remake adds nothing to the original and lacks the original film's atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie started out alrite and Alfie was an interesting character at first. The way he talks to us watching the movie and his boyish charm were fun for the first 15 minutes. But then you realize that this format stays the same and it loses its effect and the movie becomes very long.It seemed like there was no point to the movie, he just moved from one woman to another and it was always the same thing. At the end all the women had moved on while he tried to reconnect and it just wasn't moving. The scene with his kid wasn't moving either. The whole movie just seemed bland.I wouldn't recommend watching this movie unless you like pointless movies or are a Jude Law/Alfie fan.Stick to Jim Carrey :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Spoilers** ahead, so ***WARNING***I saw Alfie today. I cut my 7th period class to watch the gorgeous and talented Jude Law for two hours. And I have to admit, I wasn't disappointed. I have never seen the original Alfie, so I had nothing to compare Jude's performance to. I liked the storyline, it kept me interested, and I liked the scenes between him and Susan Surandon. Jude Law did a really good job with this, I think his acting was great. The one problem I had with the movie was the ending, I think it kind of just stopped. All of Alfie's troubles just left him saying, "What's it all about," without really giving the audience an answer to his question. Maybe we were supposed to answer it ourselves, but it kind of seemed like Alfie himself hadn't come to a conclusion. Maybe that was the point. Jude was very witty, and the way they made him talk to the audience kept me interested, the occasional side-glances and little jokes made me laugh and he was very charming. In the intense, dramatic scenes, I think he did a great job. Overall, I really did like this movie, I thought it was fun, the camera editing give it a uniqueness, and Jude Law did act and look fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a politically correct version, not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is somewhat unfair to compare Alfie 2004 with the original Alfie 1996. However, when the remake adds very little to the original then the comparison has to be made. The 1966 film was written by the Irish writer Bill Naughton and set in swinging London. Alfie was a truly original man, an original character at the time. The new Alfie is nothing novel but rather a half-hearted kickback to the good old sexist days.I think the greatest difference in the remake is that whilst Bill Naughton's original work still forms the basis of the story, co-writers Charles Shyer and Elaine Pope have been brought in. Shyer is author of such American slushy films as Father of the Bride, Baby Boom, Irreconcilable Differences and Private Benjamin. Pope on the other hand has written for Seinfeld. With these two contributing you end up with a rather fascicle American, politically correct, bite less movie which leaves you with half a smile a lot of the time.Jude Law as Alfie works well but it would have been good to have made him a little angrier, rather like the Michael Caine character. Marisa Tomei and Susan Sarandon both ply nice characters but unfortunately, the other support characters have little substance and, yet again, no bite. For instance, Sienna Miller is simply a dizzy blond and I neither felt sorry nor angry for her: she is boring. Nia Long plays the politically correct African American (read black) woman who Alfie gets pregnant but who again has little power to her performance. Is she angry, distraught, vaguely upset? It is hard to know.In the original the supporting cast included: Shelley Winters, Millicent Martin, Jane Asher, Shirley Anne Field, Eleanor Bron, Denholm Elliott, Alfie Bass and Graham Stark. Unfortunately, there are no actors with such gravitas in the 2004 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a screener on October 20th. This movie did not use the normal romantic comedy formula of boy and girl meet, have adventures, happy ending. At the same time, the plot, which was novel to me, was extremely uninteresting. The lead, a British man whose only interests are wine and women, is a limousine driver who hopes for more. He ends up burning all of his bridges and becoming alone. The movie leaves us with a man who has no one and lies to himself thinking that he needs no one. Thats it. Man starts off mediocre job womanizer, finishes as a mediocre job has-been. And he may lose his job as well.Overall, the performances were marginally acceptable. Alfie constantly has asides which ended up driving me nuts. It did not feel like an interesting way to move the story along or convey emotions. A good actor could show emotions by ACTING, not just talking to the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two remarks on the quite good experience this film is: -one is the visual aspect of the thing. This is a visual tapestry, each scene has its own visual strenght, and could actually be enjoyed on its own, but all together they make an impression on you. Every affair in Alfie's life has its own visual treatment, according to the mood of it. Colours, and camera work are elements taken care of. Watching the extras, one gets the impression that artistic values were something in the minds of theses guys, but i'll credit Ashley Rowe a great deal for what was done here. The colours are something in the line of what Chris Doyle might do. IT's interesting how Jude Law fits well this kind of photography, we saw him in similar situation in the recent 'my blueberry nights'.-the other thing is the story telling device. I haven't seen the original, so i may be commenting on something that happens already in that one, but i would bet not. Alfie speaks to the camera, he speaks to us. He denounces the staging all this is, and the artificiality of cinema in itself (lush, but artificial photography underlines this). The film is episodic in its nature, every women is an episode, but we know Alfie is our narrator, as we get every feeling directly from his mouth. Jude Law is a very interesting actor, one of the good actors we have these days, and he delivers, he knows how little dramatic and exaggerated he has to be in order to make this work. The success of this strategy is to make us assume Law's words as a dialog between him and us, instead of a monologue like, say, Depp in 'The Libertine'. Jude Law knows it, he pauses the speech, and intonate as if he was chatting, instead of narrating. Very good.Jude Law is a character in himself, even through fashion. In this film he was at the beginning of a relation with Sienna Miller, they're seen in a collection of clips reading Vogue together. This is no innocent. Actually it is a very clever way to build they're own public personalities out screen.Oh and we have a story. A playboy, single man, with his life centered on women, searching for true affection, living love as episodes and suffering from the consequences of his irresponsibility. It's a mere excuse to unfold visual storytelling. Some women, though are interesting. We have Tomei, we have Miller, we have Sarandon, who, though being limited as an actress, is well placed in the film.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely does a remake result in anything but a slap in the face to the original, unless said original was an absolute turkey, which the 1966 Alfie most certainly was not.Firstly, casting Jude Law as Alfie was a mistake. I've got nothing against Jude, but he has none of the qualities that made you love/hate Michael Caine's Alfie. Jude has the combination of looks and mannerisms that ladies love, but as a guy I can only see him as a dilettante sort of toyboy kid that nobody would ever take seriously. Nothing in the slightest Caine-esquire about him.Here I take the opportunity to ask why this board unfailingly translates "- e s q u e" into "-esquire" when I am sure that this is never what anyone means when they use it. This is completely stupid and I'm unable to understand why the administrators don't fix it. Other "spelling mistakes" can be optionally left in place, but this one is invariably "fixed".Back to the film. Another reason this doesn't work is that the sexual and gender politics have changed markedly in the last 40 years, making an Alfie-like character a lot harder to get away with. Such a transparent cad doesn't get much mileage these days.Finally, the rough edges on the original film helped rather than hindered its getting the message across. This Hollywoodized version has filed off the rough edges and given it a polish that just doesn't ring true.I don't think there's any way this film can be really enjoyed if you know anything about the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfie will ask what is it all about. Although he is talking about life in general (I assume, or maybe women), he might as well be talking about the movie. There isn't much of a plot - we follow Alfie through his womanizing life, his ups and downs, his fears and desires. Alfie can get pretty much any woman he wants by being good-looking and charming - and he does. Then problems arise. Problems we've all had I'm sure, but Alfie is just too shallow a character to elicit any real empathy. And although Jude Law plays his character extremely well, I just didn't care in the end. Maybe it was his constant babbling at the camera, maybe it was because the movie ended before we see Alfie actually turn his life around. Who knows - and who cares. "Hitch" was a far better movie about a guy who knows how to get in contact with the opposite sex. 3/10</fullReview>

First of all, I've seen very bad movies lately (blockbusters) and am tired of all the Hollywood endings. But this film got me. I love Jude Law since seeing The Talented Mr. Ripley (I'm not gay) and this flick got to me. I lived the life as a single guy for a few years and this is how single life is to me. Of course Micheal Caine was fabulous, but Jude is a good follow-up. Filmed in a newer style I still got the same (mmm, a little bit less, okay) feeling as with the old movie.At the end the essence of the older movie came to life with this newer version. He had to re-think his life and his adventures. To make this review short, I loved it!!! Again, it was one of the few movies I saw recently that got to me. I think Jude Law is a good actor and I'm gonna see this movie again. To explain a little bit, I'm 43 years old and maybe my generation like this movie better than the younger ones.8/10 for me!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying I have NOT seen the original so I am not comparing the 2. I am a huge Jude Law fan but I think I am still unbiased on seeing his movies as I have seen a few of his I did not really like.Jude Law plays a ladies man who breaks hearts in the process. He uses them for sex and when they want more, he runs. Anyone who has been in the dating field for a few years has either dated an Alfie, or even been him. If you know what it is like to be swinging single and up for a good time, you can relate to this movie. Many women have dated a man like Alfie but Alfie does have some remorse for what he has done, unlike some real-life men and some of the men I have dated lol. Jude looked gorgeous as usual. I thought the script was funny, but serious in some places. I actually got a little teary eyed during part of it.Moral of the story is-what comes around goes around. I give this movie a good solid 8/10. I was impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently, I have seen nothing but very bad remakes of old movies. I was excited to see Alfie in theaters, but then again, didn't get my hopes up. I figured it was going to a be a crappy remake like all the other remakes. I was definitely wrong! Alfie was fantastic. I'd go back and see it another four times. The fact that we have Alfie (Jude Law), the main character, talk right into the camera to us and narrate the whole movie, kept me very entertained. Maybe it's that sort of British charm? Maybe I just think the accent is cool? Either way I was entertained. He drives a vintage Vespa scooter throughout the film which gives it a more nostalgic feel. Although it was still filmed in modern day, it gave it a swinging sixties, hipster, mod feel to it. I loved it. The women throughout the film are irresistible (except for Susan Surandon, although she is still pretty hot). I was expecting a more raunchy movie, but it maintained its decency. It was just a great film. I recommend it very much. A well made remake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this remake of the star launching vehicle for Michael Caine is 8 minutes shorter than the original it takes too long to be done. By the time the final credits roll you forget the equally great performance that you have witnessed by Jude Law. I have had some questions in Mr. Law's selection of roles in the past, I find that here he found a great role but the director decided that he had to make the thing just toooooooo Lonnnnnnnnnnng.The other performances in the movie, while good, don't come close to matching that of Mr. Law. I especially like the beauty of Sienna Miller in the role of Nikki. She was a standout and I look forward to more from her in the future. Susan Sarandon did an admirable performance as the older woman and I thought that she was just the woman enough to pull it off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has obviously been a huge marketing push for the film Alfie and as a fan of Jude Law and being keen to see Sienna Miller having admired her fashion in recent media, I was keen to see this film. I haven't seen the original and went with an open mind.There were things I loved about the film and maybe those alone made it worth watching - the fashion, make up, posters on set, luxurious underwear, desirable zip up cardigan and wonderful sensually indulgent hotel rooms, made it like reading a moving magazine.However I found the characters unlikable. Alfie, despite Jude's good looks, was obnoxious throughout. I found him a bit wooden and I never fully identified with him. I suspect you are meant to dislike him in the beginning but by the end I felt no more for him - and as he is the central character and narrator, that leaves little other hooks. Sienna, again, although very sweet with stunning eye makeup, and looking cute as a button in everything she wears (including Alfie's pink shirt), the majority of her part was shown as photographs and I felt that the role proved very little of her much talked about acting ability. I would inspire to wear clothes like her but again as a character you weren't given anything meaty enough to feel for her one way or the other.My favourite bit was the flirting over the pool table scene, Alfie and beautiful lady dancing and smoking. Nicely performed and stylised.I am keen to see the original now to compare. Overall I would say, take the movie for what it is, if you enjoy clothes and fashion, it is probably worth a watch. If you are looking for something a bit deeper then this isn't the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not really like re-makes! So this film had to have had some sort of interest for me to watch it in the first place! In this case, it was The films music -I am a fan of Mick Jagger, but even this was not as good as I had expected. I am afraid to say though for me, that this was the best part of the film. Michael Cain is such a great act to follow - Jude Law did not have what it takes. Susan Sarandon was very good as Liz though and Ommar Epps (currently in 'House') I felt should have had a longer part. I do not understand though why everyone was smoking! Was it really necessary?Having the film set in the US instead of England, I think helped. For those of us who have seen the original had less to compare the film with.For me it was difficult to ascertain the time scale of the film - perhaps I was not watching as closely as I should have been.This is still a film for the 'boys' though - if I had ever come across a guy like 'Alfie' I would have crossed the road - but of course that was the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's it all about, Alfie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not get, what this film his all about... I do not get why the director didn't make this a typical Hollywood film and I do not get why this movie gets the same title as the "Alfie" of 1966. But I don't get the bad reviews either. If you just look past the remake, and think about an other title and another name for Alfie. You will find that you'll love this movie. I sure did. Alfie is a womanizer, that's not strange in this day and age. But he is a womanizer with feelings. He has a commitment problem. He cannot stay with a girl too long, because he will feel choked up. That's a common problem nowadays too. Why do you think this film was set up in New York, where there are thousands of beautiful women. Who are single and always available. As an Englishman Alfie has a lot of chance to hook up with them. With a lot of them. But in the end he finds himself alone. All the women he dated are taken and nobody wants him anymore. Not even his best friend. Soms say Alfie is too arrogant and too emotionless, to feel for him in the end, when he is left alone. But I think Alfie is just a typical man. He wants everything, but in the end he finds himself alone. With any luck he will find himself a girl like a lot of man. This is a good film. It captures what men think and what women think. I like it because it isn't predictable. It isn't a standard Hollywood movie, where the man ends up with the girl. It has a real ending and it is like the world we live in now. Not everything can be great. Some have to be happy when they have some money in their pocket...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1 of 6 movies in 2004 with that jude law...and its pretty good too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tonight we have one of six movies this year with Jude Law. The third to have come out: Alfie. Alfie is a remake of the 1966 movie of the same name that put Michael Caine on the map. Alfie, or as I like to call the story of my life, is about Alfie Elkins, a suave British lady-killer residing in New York, working as a limo driver. Known to all the women of New York for his?well lets just call it his 'reputation,' Alfie goes by his own guidelines of love by means of never getting emotionally involved. However, throughout his affairs, he realizes that the one person he would never get emotionally involved with, Julie, played by Marisa Tomei, he in fact was. The movie follows a year in the life of Alfie, as he realizes that settling down isn't such a bad thing. However, after a lifetime of being quite the playa, as you young folks like to say, settling down is easier said than done. While watching, I realized that this movie is different from almost any other movie. While its categorized as a romantic comedy, its presented in a very different manner; a very unique manner. Its not to the basic formula of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. This film, while romantic at heart, is a story about a man who comes across many hurdles in his attempt to find some sort of happiness or at least self-satisfaction. Alfie brings the audience into his life, by speaking to us, the audience, throughout the movie as if we were one of his friends, similar to what Zack Morris does in Saved by the bell. I enjoyed the presentation of this film very much as it brings the audience member more closely, more intimately to the movie itself. For the first time, Jude Law is given the chance to carry an entire movie and shows that he can do this task wonderfully. Jude Law does a magnificent job playing the lead role Alfie. And is cast wonderfully as somewhat of a sex god. I say this because most of the girls that I've talked to, have no trouble in devoting their time in worshiping this god of sexiness.Be sure to keep your eye out for another character in the movie, one that doesn't seem as obvious to the average viewer. This character being several billboards throughout the movie. Exclaiming words such as Search, Destiny, and Desire, these billboards take on a character of their own and show the physically the mood and emotion sent out through the scenes. I found these signs a very intriguing addition to the film.Alfie is well presented film with beautiful cinematography and good acting. It's a fun movie to see in this upcoming holiday season. It makes for a good date movie. Coming out on November 5th, Alfie gets 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional update of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, I think this is an excellent movie, and that with time critics will appreciate just how remarkable it is. First, it is a rarity in that it successfully updates an original that, while ahead of its time at its release, now plays like a period piece. The original explores the limitations and pathos of a man trapped in the uncertainty and personal anarchy of the 1960s sexual liberation?a liberation we now take for granted. This remake explores pathos of many men who fail to achieve an ethics of love and sex in the 21st century in light of that liberation.Michael Caine's Alfie is brought up short by the discovery that a carefree love life exacts a great price. He just can't swallow that rude truth. Jude Law's Alfie isn't fazed that there's a price?everyone in 2005 knows that. He's thrown by the realization that he's missing something fundamental in life, and worse yet, he lacks the equipment to understand what that something is. It's not that he can't face the truth?he's willing to face it, but he doesn't know how to look for it. I know quite a few men like this, and similar to Law's Alfie, they're not horrible people. They want to do the right thing and they want to find love. But they've never learned the vocabulary of love?it's as if everyone who has found it is speaking a foreign language. They've divorced themselves from the rest of us, or we've divorced them, which amounts to the same thing. That's why this film seems strangely empty?this Alfie can't even connect with people well enough to tell us what's really wrong with him.Law does a very good job portraying this lost soul, with only occasional awkwardness or unsubtlety. And the cast of women gets it exactly right, down to the last detail. The pacing and narration, purposely anachronistic?hearkening to "simpler" times?is flawless. And yes, it is a very beautiful film, visually and musically. Come back to this movie in six or eight years, or after age forty, and you'll see its value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Caine was much more handsome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manhattan is at its most inviting, exteriors as snazzy as those on "Sex in the City," interiors appropriate to the socio-economic stratum of each of Alfie's ladies. Law shucks his shirt once, which seems odd since the R rating would have permitted many more body shots, but, although short of cash and living more on what he can scrounge - he is not a go-getter in terms of career - he dresses well. Law doesn't have to reach into his versatile repertoire of accents, although he was magnificent as a brooding American in "Cold Mountain," perfect as the rich fellow in "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and appropriately robotic (meant in the best possible way) as the friend of Haley Joel Osment in the heart-rending "A.I." He here puts forth his mid-class English accent, not in the Caine cockney mode nor as one who wouldn't be out of place talking to plants with Prince Charles. The actor has the English sounds that make many Americans swoon - do Londoners fall into paroxysms of adulation when someone chatters at them in Minnesota-ese? - and he is possessed of such a fine set of choppers and regularity of feature and symmetry of face that we needn't struggle to believe that this bloke can do as Alfie does: get the birds and fly right with them to, at the least, a carnal high</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the worst movies that I have been subjected to in a long time. It didn't quite know if it was: A) a chick flick because of Jude Law consuming the screen every single moment B) a manly flick because of all the hot women running around half naked.C) Or just a hodge podge of doomed relationships/one night stands.The movie didn't quite know what it was and left us in the same perturbed state as its main character. Jude was adorable, the NYC life was fun to watch, but overall the movie lacked substance. And not to mention the lack of social awareness when it came to the women in the film. Stay away... unless of course you have an undying love for Jude Law. But after sitting through this your love will wither away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amiable yes...Pointless...very</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is something of a curate's egg of a film...the original is so well remembered and well liked that it is easy to forget the flaws, but for modern studios keen to exploit an audience who may know the name of a film but be unfamiliar or unwilling to check out the original a rush to the remake seems an obvious answer to accessing new dollar streams.The problem with the film is it simply isn't a very strong idea. The supporting cast is good with Susan Sarandon in excellent form whereas Jude Law remains unconvincing as a lead man capable of carrying a film, particularly one based on material as slight as this. Add in to the mix a real sense of out of place machismo and laddishness that strikes a rather unpleasant note in these modern times with several pinches of homophobia, the whole thing starts to stink up a theater despite Law's best attempts to walk through another role with his usual trademark cheeky but good looking persona...it will work for some I have no doubt but...with leaden direction and pedestrian eye for editing Alfie is one for pay-per-view or Blockbuster curiosity when you can't find anything else on.And let's not forget Mick Jagger's whining irritation of a soundtrack - a discordant mix of songs that somehow jars the nerves at "poignant" moments.All in all another sorry case of reaching for the remake, attempting an update of something best left to sit in its own 60s time capsule, rather than try and find something new, fresh and invigorating...give your brain a break and see Jude in a minor role in a good film like I Heart Huckabees instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really: The Worst Movie Of The Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That movie was a huge disappointment. I mean the story wasn't the best so far. So I expected an easy, funny movie with perhaps some surprising moments but I didn't have high expectations. Well as it seems I could still be deceived. Why? Because the movie is entirely predictable. From the first scene to the last. Because after the first 10-15 min the story gets more and more boring. Because the character development is so cliché that it hurts. Because there is nothing more to watch for after the movie started up. Even the ending is a huge letdown. If u have time I mean even if you are completely bored don't watch it. Start re-arraging your room, sorting clothes or counting the tiles on the floor. But do not watch this movie unless you like being bored to death by a storyline that has been told in a much better way already a thousand times.That movie has well merited 1(awful)/10 points.</fullReview>

Without giving anything away the ending of the movie (well the penultimate scene) is one of the most powerful character moments I have ever seen.If you have a certain amount of life experience and are open to a slow, intelligent movie and characters this is a good choice. Otherwise stay away.P.S. Jude Law is the only person I could see in a role that was once owned by Michael Cane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just in case you don't remember, Alfie's that misogynistic cad who seduced a series of women. He was originally played by Michael Caine in more carefree times (1966, to be precise). What we have here is a politically correct remake for the new millennium. Cries of horror abound. Especially from me. Why replace Michael Caine, one of the kings of cool in the 1960's, with Jude Law? After all, we all remember what happened when Mark Wahlberg stepped into Caine's shoes for the remake of The Italian Job. Yet, incredibly, Law has turned out to be a very good choice. Like Caine before him, Law repeatedly breaks the fourth wall throughout the film. Certain critics have argued against this technique, but I think that when applied properly, and with the right actor, it can seriously work in the film's favour. It did so for John Cusack in High Fidelity, and does so for Jude Law in the Alfie remake. Law adds a further dimension to the flawed title character, somehow making you like him in spite of what he is. Of course, it doesn't hurt that he is surrounded by a fine supporting cast, which includes Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon and his real-life girlfriend Sienna Miller.One notable thing Alfie does, in general, is refuse to paint its women in shining colours. Some refuse to bow down to the title character's needs, but others are all-too-easily seduced. Yet they are never too forgiving. I think Marisa Tomei's Julie is the only one of the women in the film who is really shown in a remotely positive light. The others appear too needy, too repressed or too cocky. Allowing the women to appear this way sometimes works against the film, but it does mean that they come off as more rounded characters, and not just pretty ciphers.I found this version of Alfie to be lightly entertaining. It's hardly new or original - I mean, it's nothing more than an already well-known story retold pretty well - but it is easy to watch. And, just like Alfie himself, it never looks for the easy way out. Whether you want to despise the title character's antics or simply enjoy watching them is entirely up to you. Personally, I'd suggest you choose the latter option. Rating: *** (out of *****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! Simply awful!It's on the same level as Alex &amp; Emma and Eyes Wide Shut - not kidding, it's that bad. Who greenlighted this??? The movie was so bad my friends and I almost walked out but we wanted to see how this train wreck came to an end. Don't get me wrong, there are some good things about the movie - three actually - the first is Jude Law - he is definitely hot and nice to watch - but even he can't save this stinker (he's no Johnny Depp). The second good thing about this movie is that Susan Sarandon is good (she has the best line) but her role is too brief. That's about it for the positives. The writing is awful, the way he talks to the camera every two seconds is distracting (it didn't work on the first episode of Sex and the City, why would it work here?) and the plot is dreadful. Charles Shyer should've stayed married to Nancy Meyers - she's a much better writer/director (Something's Gotta Give). The third good thing about this movie is that I saw it for free. But I still feel like the filmmakers owe me something for having to sit through nearly two hours of bad 'entertainment'. Don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jude Law undoubtedly captures the character of Alfie, the carefree playboy womaniser. Although not as good as the original, this remake is pretty good.Packed with sexy women, Alfie takes us on a journey through his life of fun, excitement, disappointment and hurt and Jude Law's performance is truly top-notch, so much so you can't help but love his character, in-spite of his shallow morales.With a limited appeal, Alfie certainly targets a specific audience, all of whom probably need to be Jude Law fans to begin with.Alfie is a film that you could easily hate, but I was compelled from the opening scene to the end, and I found beneath all the cold hearted antics a heart warming story and character that was good fun to watch.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Jude Law for the first time on Broadway on an adaptation of a Jean Cocteau play. He was a stunner. You could see his future even from where I was sitting, one of the cheapest sits at the back of the theatre. Then "Gattaca" a poor film that Jude Law's presence alone awarded some sort of cult status. Other films with the likes of Jeanne Moreau, David Cronnenberg, Jenifer Jason Leigh. All good stuff, all seem to confirm my original impression. Then, "Wilde" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and I thought -- Amazing, we haven't had an actor like this, ever. Forget about his beauty, if you can, and concentrate in his mind boggling range. In Mr. Ripley the film never recovers from his death and in "Wilde" you understand, you actually understand Oscar Wilde, losing absolutely everything for him. He introduced the only entertaining moments in "Artificial Intelligence" and then, something happened, too many films and not too much judgement. In "Cold Mountain" he didn't have the epic scope that, in my modest opinion, the character required. In "Road to Perdition" he indulges in a shallow show off performance overshadowed by a theatrical costume and rotten teeth. But "Alfie" is, quite simply, unforgivable. Not a moment of truth, not a moment of charm, not a moment of beauty. The three elements that brought Jude Law up this moment. I left the theatre more than disappointed, I left angry because I recognised the symptoms of a potentially, mythological career, in real danger. I hope Jude Law sees the light, unless he is satisfied with the Troy Donohue award. If that's the case, well, he already got it. "Alfie" got it for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sir Michael Caine was perfect in the original classic comedy drama, so it was going to be interesting seeing another big English actor taking on the role, from director Charles Shyer (Father of the Bride). Basically, set in Manhattan (what's wrong with good old London, England), our leading man, talking directly to us, is cockney English limousine driver Alfie Elkins (Jude Law). He talks about wanting to own his own limousine company, and his food and drink tastes, but more than anything he talks about how he has dabbled with women. Aflie is charming and charismatic to women, knowing the right things to say, and he wants to make love to many women with no commitment or responsibilities, until he finds "the one". But as he spends time with these women, among others single mother Julie (Marisa Tomei), rich married but neglected Dorie (30 Rock's Jane Krakowski), girlfriend of his friend Marlon (Omar Epps) - Lonette (Are We There Yet's Nia Long), turbulent alcoholic Nikki (Sienna Miller) and rich older woman Liz (Susan Sarandon), he finds problems. He finds he has to take much more respo0nbility as these relationships become difficult, with such occurrences like erectile dysfunction, pregnancy, suspected testicular cancer and much more, coming to the conclusion brief encounters aren't the way to go. Also starring Tara Summers as Carol and Dick Latessa as Joe. Law is obviously better looking than he is really getting into the character, the American setting isn't really a really big deal apart from maybe some of the lifestyle and stuff, it's just a cheap way to hype it up a bit, and it just adds to its feel of not being as good as the original. It won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Mick Jagger and David A. Stewart's "Old Habits Die Hard". Jude Law was number 60, and Susan Sarandon number 25 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Law was also number 10 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jude Law is no Micheal Caine , and he should understand that no one can be Micheal Caine. Having said that I was all out to rip this movie as I am a member of Boycott Hollwood for remaking classics club. I have not seen the original but in my opinion the reason why this version of Alfie is probably not no where near as good as the original due to the fact that times and attitudes towards, gender , race and politics and women have changed dramatically since 1966. Although I felt that Jude Law tries to mad, cocky, carefree and flamboyant he fails miserably and ends up becoming dim-witted arrogant and is one of those people who would love to punch in the face in the bar on Friday because you don't like the way way he looks! I mean the movie just shows Jude Law shagging, talking to the camera and tells people advice about women (not that me or any self respecting player needs to take advice from a pep-squeak who cried when Sienna Miller dumped him). Although there were several valid points made by him during the movie it is true that life breaks in mysterious ways I would know a thing or 2 about that. In general Alfie is a movie which no one really has to watch because it seems like a waste of time , however it feels glad to get it out of my system and not to mention that it proves my point to hate Jude Law even more.ALFIE : 6.2 OUT OF 10HE WAS A PLAYER UNTIL HE GOT PLAYED...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My admittedly cramped take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original, so if you're looking for an historic perspective, look elsewhere.What can I say?: I really like Jude Law. I like his good stage sense; he exudes entertainment value, and (as long as he's well-directed) this makes him worth watching.Nice to see him get a lead role; another commenter complained about his asides to the audience--not as organic as Caine's--but I thought they were well-directed, and I feel Law takes direction very well.Everything is set up beautifully. It's an operatic theme, grand in its simplicity: A man is a loser mix of natural-born girlslayer, while being tragically limited by fundamentally loveless views of relationship; really, just Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin without the songs. Just paint the picture, paint it clearly and well, don't forget to imbue it with humanity (read: humor), thereby making it all that much more tragic. Oh: And don't resolve it. Leave it for us to resolve within ourselves. They could have pulled their punches with a facile resolution; as feelgood as it would be lacking in genuine redemptive power.Interesting question: No doubt some will more or less reflexively reject a remake; some right out of the gate, others after watching it with a suspicious, jaundiced eye. But the important thing is that grand, operatic theme I allude to in the previous paragraph. Do they or do they not deliver those specific goods?: A picture of an incomplete man.I say they do. And, insofar as they do, this is a picture with a big vision.In other words, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One problem with a remake is that it will always be compared with the superior original, which after all is the reason for the remake as who would remake a flop? The film had to be updated and relocated, but otherwise follows the storyline of the original with some of the dialogue preserved intact. Although many viewers have complained that the speaking to the camera device is cheesy, I enjoyed it and feel that the film would not have worked without it. We needed to know what Alfie was thinking and this was better than a voice over.Does it stand alone as a film worth watching if you had never seen the original? My answer would be yes. Jude Law plays Alfie as a slightly better class and more likable character than Michael Caine, the working class Cockney who does not know that he has a chip on his shoulder when it comes to the rest of Britain's class ridden society. The new Alfie may be selfish and conceited, but he is also handsome, charming and funny, and uses that charm to bend women regardless of age, to his will. The scene where he cajoles his middle aged landlady, Mrs. Schnitman to clean his room for him, and probably do his washing as well, shows how manipulative he can be, but in a nice way. The landlady knows he is manipulating her, but he is doing it in such a charming way that she is eating out of his hands - after all when was the last time a handsome young man held her hand, looked into her eyes and flattered her like that? Michael Caine's Alfie was a cold heartless cad. In many ways Alfie has not outgrown adolescence. He has lots of nice threads, goes out every night, rarely sleeps in his own bed and has women galore for uncommitted sex. His good looks have attracted women with a minimum of effort on his part and if one goes out of his life there is another one right there. He feels entitled to sex without commitment, but one day he wakes up to find that the others have all moved on and he is left alone with nothing to show for it. He is incapable of understanding that relationships, like careers, require some commitment. He is like a man who changes jobs and relocates throughout his life, then in middle age wonders why all his friends have all moved up the ladder and have comfortable homes and families, while he is still living in cheap lodgings, working at low paid jobs while getting passed over in favour of younger workers.Despite the problem of constant comparison with the original, I preferred Jude Law's cheeky charm, for a start he is much more handsome than Michael Caine and did not display the coldness. The main thing I missed was the intoxicating atmosphere of 1960's swinging London, despite Mick Jagger's contribution to the soundtrack. The only other jarring note was casting Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter in a cameo role, which distracted me by diverting attention from the interplay with Susan Sarandon. I also missed the bar fight at the Bag o' Nails with Queenie Watts belting out a jazzed up "Goodbye Dolly Gray" without flinching, as if bar fights were part of the nightly entertainment, which in that part of London they probably were. I would recommend this film if you have NOT seen the original, or wish to watch both for comparison.</fullReview>

Law stars as a limo driver who's young, dashing, and always having an eye for the ladies. It seems that he's one of those "All the women want him and all the men want to be him" type of guys. He's got the world by its proverbial . . . well, you know (need to keep it PG), and everyone sees it. His best friend knows it (I think that's why they hung out so much), and even the women who don't like him change their sneer into a blushing smile when he gives them more than 2 seconds notice.But here's where the "reap what you sow" part comes in, but I'm gonna stop right there (here...whatever), because I give this movie 2 1/2 stars (out of 4) for a rating and, if you're into dry humor, pretty people (you know what I mean), I'd highly recommend this film. If Bruce Willis in Die Hard is the only kind of movie that you will sit long enough for, then take the dog for a LONNNNNNNG walk while your lady watches this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief 2 cents worth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost everything's been said by the excellent commentators here. I will just add that Jude Law's Alfie would not have gotten a 2nd date from any of these women.He showed no liking for them, let alone romance, didn't even bother to get undressed in the sex scenes! Alfie, Version 1, Michael Caine, had it all his own way, because women in those days did think they were lucky to get such a charmer. Today, if he did not treat them with at least a modicum of respect and affection it would go no further.Secondly, Alfie #2 finds an older man as mentor (an actor with as much personality on screen as the scarf Jude Law occasionally wore round his neck) - why on earth didn't they use Michael Caine?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jude Law is only reason to see this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfie is an inferior remake of the near classic film from the 1960's starring Micheal Caine.Jude Law is very good, as the classic bounder who uses the ladies as toys. However, he is in every scene, either being his character or doing voice over. There are a bevy of lovely actresses doing there best as put upon women. Susan Sarandon portrays the same role Shelly Winters did in the original version.The story of a charming cad does not really work, no matter how hard they try. Filmed in New York with a music score by Mick JaggerSharper editing may have helped, The film could be cut by at least 15 minutes.rating **1/2 out of 4 71 points out of 100 IMDb 6 out of 10The original Alfie probably got a ***1/2 rating</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just For Fans..Not for me!..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I don't really like films about "Casanovas", I just wanted to see how Jude Law would be acting in such a film. So, I decided to get a Divx version of it, and watch it on my personal computer. On the cover of movie poster, there is a statement, which goes like this: Meet a man who never met a women he didn't love.But while watching it, I quickly noticed that that words were not true at all. Alfie is a man, who does simple things to please women in order to get them in bed, or get them treat him in such a good way. And, in almost every scene of the film, he gives some sort of advise to us, the viewers. Yet, at the end of the day, the cocky boy Alfie messes up and feels sorry for the mistakes he has made. The film is boring, and I think only Jude Law fans will enjoy it, because its all about Jude being Alfie and you can hardly see a scene without his face showing up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just what we needed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...another pointless remake of a 60s classic - and another Michael Caine flick at that.This modern version of the seminal 60s British film that finally jump-started Caine's stuttering film career is a rather pallid remake of the original that possesses neither its cold cynicism nor its harsh view of life. What it does have going for it, however, is a winning performance from Jude Law, some slick editing, and good cinematography.The 21st Century's Alfie has been transplanted from the so-called Swinging London of the 60s to modern day New York City. Alfie (Jude Law) is altogether more slick and likable than his predecessor, having both dispensed with the habit of calling a woman 'it' and acquired an element of boyish charm that he turns off and on as the situation demands. Like the original Alfie, this one comes across as a complete emotional thug at first; the women in his life are just pawns, to be played and manipulated, and sacrificed when they begin to demand a little equality in the relationship. He sees them as little more than warm bodies to be plundered, and, in what proves to be a pivotal moment in his life, has sex with his best friend's girlfriend with few qualms ? other than a fear of his deceit being discovered by the cuckolded boyfriend.Up to this point, the two Alfies follow a more or less identical path, but their paths diverge fairly early on as the modern Alfie slowly begins to pick up on hints supplied by the narrative that his carefree laddish philosophy is more than a little flawed. Caine's Alfie remains blind to his deficiencies until one horrific moment opens his eyes. It's a moment that is missing from this film, apparently because the producers couldn't figure out a believable way to incorporate it in a film set in the present day; the alternative scenario they choose to signpost Alfie's transition almost inevitably pales in comparison to the original and is then made largely redundant by subsequent events. As in the original, Law continuously breaks the fourth wall, and for a device that quickly fell out of practice after the original film, it works quite well. Law plays to the camera with aplomb, throwing it a winning smile here and there, sharing sly jokes with the audience from which the other characters are excluded, and posing and preening like a metrosexual model at every opportunity.ALFIE isn't as bad as its reputation suggests. Every remake of a classic suffers in comparison to the original simply because of the place the first movie holds in the viewer's memory. Most classic films acquire that status because people like them, and few people like seeing them copied, therefore remakes have to overcome an inbuilt resistance that place them at a disadvantage from the outset. This film pretty much gets things right by establishing its own look and character while retaining a number of recognisable elements from the original. Writers Pope and Shyer attempt to incite perhaps a little too much viewer empathy with Alfie, which results in a somewhat uneven movie, and at the film's conclusion, Alfie's summing up somehow lacks the emotional impact of the original ? which is strange, because it is almost identical to the one Caine made to such good effect.Bottom line: this one won't find its way onto any top ten lists, but it will provide a diverting couple of hours of entertainment.Now? when ARE they going to remake ESCAPE TO VICTORY?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emasculated PC Alfie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake has dumbed down and emasculated Alfie to the point that he's just "meh.." or as one woman in film says - "I don't understand what they see in this Eurotrash..".The updates in situational details from the Michael Caine original are extremely well done especially the pivotal subplot with his best friend. The pathetic doormats of women that worked in the 60's were wisely replaced by more modern versions. But as is so often the case, someone in the movie-making machinery missed the point of the exercise when they tried to make Alfie PC and the tale more of a morality play (it was in the original too but they trusted the audience to get it without Alfie having to tell us explicitly...). The central point about Alfie in the original was that he never really understands or changes and this childlike innocence is what makes Alfie charming and interesting in spite of all the nasty things he does. In the remake, this is lost after the first five minutes as Alfie morphs into Dr. Phil.If you can get by some of the dated situations - see the original. The Caine Alfie is timeless because we all know someone like Alfie who is the bull in the china shop that doesn't mean to hurt anyone...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Little Arc to the Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two primary critiques that I have of this movie. This movie was all about the title character played by Jude Law. There was little depth in the other characters, although wonderfully played by the actresses involved. In particular, the time spent on screen with Nia Long and Marisa Tomei was enjoyable. Given the focus on the Alfie character, one would expect that character to evolve from his experience on the screen. While Alfie reacted to the events in his life, he didn't seem to grow much from those experiences. As a result, the plot seemed to move from one hedonistic event to another in a manner that did not keep my attention.The second critique is that this movie relied heavily from "the aside" as a cinematic device. Alfie talks to us in the audience from beginning to end. The use of the aside consistently reminds me that I am watching a movie and prevents be from being engrossed in the plot. It also seems to enable the writer to be much more shallow in the presentation since Alfie's thoughts can be transferred directly to us through the narrative instead of enabling us to infer his thoughts from the nuance of the dialog.This plot idea is wonderful, but the remake failed to deliver in many ways. I can't recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfie is a move to think about our times and human relationships. Acting is acceptable for this kind of movie, why compare it to the original? This is a common human flaw, just accept it as it is, what really counts is if you like it or not and if you got something out of it. It is a piece of real life, one more of the millions of stories happening in the world each day. If you are a player and think the world is a chess board, sooner or later you will find that this is not the case. It will happen in real life, when people realize they have been used, will turn their back on you and move on, nobody will wait for you, and at the end, you will end up alone like Alfie did - no Hollywood endings or magic potion to save you. Alfie has the characteristics that, in my opinion, any movie should have: entertain and keep you thinking after you go out of the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's It All About?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with remakes is that there's always the inevitable comparison to the original film. In this case, Jude Law can not eclipse Michael Caine's Alfie from 1966 in what is essentially the same character. Caine's Alfie, which made him a star nearly forty years ago, was simultaneously more likable and despicable than Law's. Alfie is a tireless womanizer who doesn't realize the damage he causes himself and cares less about the damage he causes others. The performances are the thing to watch in the newer version. Jude Law, as Alfie, is likable and despicable, but ultimately seems a little more full of apprehension about his way of life than Caine was. A good supporting cast helps this version smooth over the bumps, one of which is that the running time seems longer than 103 minutes. Jane Krakowski, who I really don't care for to begin with, is fine in her brief bits as one of Alfie's girls. Marisa Tomei is good as Alfie's "main" girlfriend, who has a child that Alfie has taken a slight liking to. Omar Epps is Alfie's long suffering best friend who gets taken advantage of in the end. Nia Long is Epps' girl who gets involved with Alfie to her detriment. Susan Sarandon is fantastic in her role as Alfie's older woman who simply wants available sex and who provides Alfie with his comeuppance. Sienna Miller, as another of Alfie's loves, is Law's real life significant other. They're all fine here and with one or two of them being less so, this would not have been as watchable as it is. The film goes wrong in two ways. First, why film a remake, originally set in London, in the United Kingdom, but then say the story occurs in New York City? It doesn't make sense. There is no point in particular that the film makes about American men, so why change the setting? As a result, the scooter that Alfie rides seems a little out of place. Second, this film had a much more blander dilemma (and one which is relatively common these days) facing Alfie than in the original film, considering all the modern day problems he could have faced instead. The original was more surprising and shocking in this respect and served as a believable catalyst for Alfie to change at the end. In the new version, the paleness of the challenges facing Alfie in comparison to those in the old version do not signal that he might change. There isn't the same sense of a moral line being crossed, and that's really just more indicative of the kind of people some of us have become. Isn't it? Mick Jagger, in conjunction with Dave Stewart, contributed original songs to the soundtrack. This is a step up of sorts for Charles Shyer, until now a Director of family fare. Screenwriter Stephen Gaghan (Traffic) has a small role as Adam. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

But this film will not only deliver Jude as hunky as can be, but it also serves as good therapy. What girl out there hasn't risked falling for the bad-boy who could break her heart and hoped that maybe she would be the one to change him? Comeon, we have all been that girl at one point or another. Here is a film that will give every woman that "excuse" that "apology" that "depth" she wishes she had received or seen from the man that left her wondering "what happened?". It definitely makes you feel better about things, but, and I mean BUT, do not even remotely consider calling that man that broke your heart thinking that you now somehow understand him and that perhaps this time it will be different.

		<fullReview>Jude Law is such a great actor and this performance proves it. Alfie is a limo driver and a professional womanizer. The man jumps from women to women and then can't figure out why he's alone. Alfie, an Englishman, is living it up in NYC using his charms on every woman he meets, they do his laundry and clean his apartment. He starts with a romp in the back of his limo and then off to his girl Julie (Marisa Tomei) who finds a pair of panties that are not hers. He then finds a way to drown his sorrows with Liz (Susan Sarandon, she looks fabulous) before moving on to Nikki, who is played by real life fiancé Sienna Miller. I have to say that the movie was great and that it has a non-traditional ending which any other ending would have been to Hollywood. Watch for a few things: Alfies comic book collection is really Jude Laws, The green fairy, the color of the babies eyes and the guy who runs the limo company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>acceptable comedy for the "sex and the city"-generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the sixties Michael Caine played "Alfie" and it was as British as it could be but some decades later, it looks like London lost its mod-image and therefore director Charles Shyer and his crowd decided it was better to film it in New York (even if some of the scenes are filmed in Manchester anyway). Alfie is now played by Jude Law and the critics just said that "Jude Law is Alfie". Well, what do we got here? Alfie is a Brit who immigrated to New York at where he learned the skills to conquer a lady's heart, even if his job is driving a limo. During this comedy you'll see him having relationships with five different women and apart from the sex factor, everything happens with a high and a low. But as soon as one of his "girls" got accidentally pregnant, Alfie is faced with the big question of life : isn't it time to get a real life or in other words, isn't time Mr. Family Man comes around? But what can you do if you're a wanted playboy and all women are screaming for more? Perhaps the elderly woman Liz (Susan Sarandon in her sexiest role ever) can change Alfie's way of life? "Alfie" isn't exactly the kind of movie that will change your life but its hipness and quite good performance from Law makes it a rather enjoyable comedy like we saw too less recently. Sadly enough this film didn't become the success it hoped to be, but acceptable comedies are rather rare these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What it's NOT about.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, this version does not compare one bit to the very superior original. Like some of the other reviewers mentioned, this is a watered-down, politically correct shadow of the original with not even half the impact. 'Alfie' was always thought of as a comedy, but if you ever watched the original, there was much sadness &amp; complexity brimming just underneath the surface. A trite, romantic comedy it never was. I think some people look at the original as being this outdated, quaint product of its time, but the truth of the matter is that its insight into human matters, people, relationships is conveyed more successfully &amp; has a harder hitting impact than the newer, flashier, 'contemporary' original. The acting style is different, women &amp; attitudes towards them have changed since then, but the ideas &amp; message remain all too relevant today. The remake is quite bland &amp; many of its ideas have been diluted. Even the ending, which is quite similar to the original,&amp; is almost word for word, lacks the impact of the 1966 version. Amazing what a difference line deliveries &amp; nuances in performance can make.Perhaps what is the weakest element in this new version &amp; is the most annoying aspect to me, is the appalling lifeless soundtrack; a bland, blues-y/rock, Saturday Night Live, generic brand of bar/pub music. I don't care if it is Dave Stewart &amp; Mick Jagger, but they are well past their prime &amp; this music shows it. This music has none of the power or life that the Sonny Rollins soundtrack of the original had. Rollins' music drove the film along, reflected not only London of the period, but the human element of the story, something the new soundtrack does not do at all. Alfie2004's soundtrack is insipid in every way. I never thought I'd ever be defending Cher, but give me her version of Alfie any day over anything in this new version. I may going on about the music, but a good soundtrack is 50% of any movie, &amp; it can sink a film if it doesn't work. The only 2 interesting bits of music that do work is the Skatalites tune used early on in the film, &amp; the piece of music used when Alfie gets it on with the older woman(Sarandon) in her apartment. In the case of the former, it's used only as a decorative piece, or for ambiance(but works nicely), whereas with the latter it builds the scene of seduction up quite nicely.It's sad that a good film like this has to be remade, &amp; that people can't see past the surface of a 60's London or older acting styles to realize that what the 1966 version has to say is still relevant, still universal, &amp; holds true in today's modern times, regardless of changes in fashion &amp; location. No need to redress something up in new clothes &amp; weaken the impact of its ideas when it was all done properly in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are there really creeps out there as superficial and self-absorbed as Alfie? Perhaps... but his pure bold and unaffected lightheartedness--oft-described as Jude Law's irrefutable, undeniable charm as a modern-day cad--forces us to give Alfie a break, no matter how big a dog he is. At least, initially.Aside from his light-hearted brilliance, it is clear Alfie has to be redeemed. No modern movie could safely permit Alfie to not be introspective what with HIV/AIDS, sexual promiscuity, etc. remaining sensitive subjects here in the still vaguely conservative USofA. Alfie has to look inward at his "caddishness," his faults, his mistakes, and ultimately his true emptiness.Sadly, he comes to no earth-shattering conclusions other than, perhaps, a vague awareness that he cannot persist forever in the miasma of a sexually promiscuous stew.Law is not a huge revelation in this role--we almost expect a man of his obvious looks and talent to pull it off with ease--and his sensitivity is generally pinched, but, like Alfie himself, it's hard not to like him. And it's interestingly ironic that Law divorced his wife in real life and shacked up with his co-star in this movie. How art imitates life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's it all for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the original 1960s version of "Alfie", starring Michael Caine, but if it's anything like the 2004 remake with Jude Law -- thanks, but no thanks.One problem with the 21st-century "Alfie" is that it continually takes great pains to remind us of its predecessor. For one thing, Jude Law is as close a match physically to a young Michael Caine as you could hope to find among the current crop of Hollywood actors. For another thing, the 2004 film has a soundtrack strongly reminiscent of the Sixties. And just in case we missed the fact that this is a remake, we get to hear Joss Stone warble "What's is all about, Alfie?" over the closing credits -- which, by the way, are the most original aspect of the film.Another problem with "Alfie" (2004) is precisely its soundtrack. If I wanted non-stop, wall-to-wall music blaring in my ears, I'd get myself an iPod. What's it all about? Offhand, I'd say it was about plugging the soundtrack for two hours.Finally, Jude Law is a great actor -- not to mention easy on the eyes and quite fetching in a towel. But his character, Alfie, is a sorry excuse for a human being and (in my opinion) a complete waste of a moviegoer's time and money. If I'm going to plunk down $10 and spend two hours of my time, give me a character who is at least likable, if not necessarily admirable. More importantly, give me a hero who learns something along the way, instead of one like Alfie, who still doesn't get it by the final reel.Okay, I knew going in that Alfie was the kind of guy who is afraid to commit to a relationship with a woman. But shouldn't the film have given us some idea of why this is so? There are hints that Alfie has learned everything he knows about life from his father: that you should "never depend on anyone". But didn't Alfie have a mother too? What did he learn from her? The 2004 film also suggests that Alfie has a soft spot in his heart for his erstwhile single-mom girlfriend's little boy. But again, we are given no rationale. A younger version of himself, perhaps?As the house lights went up, the question in my mind wasn't "What's it all about?" Rather, it was, "What's it all for?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had great hopes for this remake because I really like Jude Law and I loved the original Alfie from years ago, starring Michael Caine. Unfortunately, this film has none of the breezy charm of the original - it's heavy-handed from the get-go, where Alfie wanders the streets of New York passing huge billboards reading tawdry things like PURSUE on them. The soundtrack (with songs from Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart) is heavy-handed as well, and as the film goes on (and on, and on) it becomes downright trite. Even some great shots of New York City at Christmas and a wonderful performance from Susan Sarandon (as a sort of female Alfie) can't redeem the contrived nature of the proceedings, and -=- POSSIBLE SPOILER -=- by the last scene, where Alfie delivers his final desperate speech directly to the audience, you are wishing for a billboard behind him that would read REFUND. My IMDb rating: a 4, equivalent to **. (Also, in my review of Shattered Image, I forgot to give my rating: a 1, equivalent to NO stars - yes, it was THAT bad. This Alfie remake is an art film in comparison.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be a great source of amusement. Unlike many movies, I wasn't focused on interpreting the moral of the story, and I didn't feel that I was participating in the lifestyle of the characters while I watched (due in part to the curious narrative style). Jude Law speaks constantly to the audience throughout the feature, but this conversation is integrated seamlessly with the movie. I didn't notice any major acting, editing, or plot deficiencies, and that is always a good sign. The main character is a relatively young Englishman in America, Alfie, who leads a promiscuous and frivolous life. The story follows Alfie to his highest and lowest points, although his irrepressible optimism prevents this from being a potentially depressing movie. Interestingly enough, I found this film to be a fairly accurately portrayal of a few people I know quite well. I watched the film with my girlfriend, and she enjoyed it as much as I did. It might be easier for men to understand the inner workings of Alfie's mind, although not all of us are like him. I would recommend this movie to all of my friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Alfie knowing little about it, yet maintaining high hopes. I knew the basic subject matter but had no expectations on its technical aspects.Thankfully I was surprised by Alfie's good direction, excellent editing aside from a few still frame montages, and well-structured screenplay.Complaints about this movie come mostly from those who like the original. I have not seen it so cannot comment on it, but I can say I despise most remakes as much as the next guy. However, no matter how good the Cain version might be, I would still have to admit that Law's Alfie is simply a very good movie. It is easy to find some level of enjoyment in this picture no matter who you are. The past few weeks have been cluttered with meaningless flop after meaningless flop and finally a film that is funny, intelligent, and well-done has arrived. Up until Alfie, Team America: World Police has been the best movie in the past two months (and I don't mean to undermine Team America, which made me laugh to the point of agony). Still, when expressive puppets are the highlight of the fall movie season it is clear that something is a bit off. It's nice to finally get something that has real actors who can really act.If you go to Alfie be sure you do so knowing what you're getting yourself into. It's all about relationships and being a bachelor and life lessons and what not. To me, it was well worth it and the final message in the film is one I did not expect and that was in no way formulaic. There are several other messages in the film revolving mostly around looks and "perfection". There is a bit of worthwhile nudity as well, but it all has a point, a very deep and interesting point, which is odd these days.This is a great addition to Jude Law's already superb and growing career. See this movie with a girlfriend or boyfriend (as long as fights won't incur afterward) or alone and pick up a few girl-getting tips and a few laughs as well.Good everything, great performance, really wouldn't be surprised if Oscar came knocking on Alfie's door.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this was supposed to be New York, which took a while to figure out as obviously it wasn't filmed in the city--duh--why did Alfie have to be Cockney, putting a strain on the U.S. viewer's ear? And don't let the TV trailer fool you. This is not a romantic comedy. In fact, the problem is that no sustained story line is offered. What is the central conflict? Alfie with Alfie, which really isn't enough to keep up audience interest. The movie logs in as kind of mawkish and moralistic, overall. On the other hand, Jude Law is a good actor and some of the actresses are also great. As for the black actress, she's excellent--best seen on television on The Third Watch as a complex, strong character. What a shame people don't have to pass a test to make a film.G.

		<fullReview>After a day out i was looking forward to sitting down and watching a movie, i wanted to see something else but was talked into this. I sat down and tried to watch it. To my surprise this was easier than I'd first thought. Spoilers may follow....We join Alfie a an average chauffeur with expensive taste. He's cocky and arrogant but stick with it. Told in a narrative form, a bit like Fight Club, we learn his take on life. Live now, die later. The rest of the film shows his ideals get turned around as different things happen in his life. Leaving him having to think about what's it all about.I've never seen the original film so have nothing to compare it to, but that helped me enjoy, if you look for flaws you will find them, but look at as a modern day story of a mans battle with himself. Jude Law carries the film brilliantly as the lead and his supporting ladies provide the eye candy. It was entertaining and had all the nonsense you'd come to expect of a romance story, laughs, crys blahh blahh blahh, except.....and that's why it's different! Its the perfect film to take your girlfriend to and you guys will enjoy it. Learn from his actions too. In closing, not expecting it, this film took me by surprise and if it wasn't for the name i'm sure people would look at this in a different light, the light i was lucky enough to see it in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you all stark raving mad?! Why is it that everyone insists on saying that Caine's version of all films are better than the re-makes. Caine has about all the charisma of a petrified tuna fish, if that; he is also extremely irritating. There is a reason people are re-doing all his films and it isn't just that they were good films, it is a secret underground bid to rid the world of Michael Caine (one which i fully support). People who are inclined to dismiss 2004's Alfie are no doubt those who assume ugliness must at least guarantee good acting, not in Caine's case. To those people i would suggest actually watching this new Alfie and they will see that not only is Law a much, much prettier sight to see, he is also better at acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was certainly a brave step to remake the classic Michael Caine movie! A lot of people have already decided that this film is rubbish without even seeing it. To those people out there, I hope I can convince you to give the film a try as it is actually quite good!What we need to remember is that Caine's Alfie wasn't the first anyway. It was adapted from a stage production, and so this new version is just an update of the story. Alfie is a womanizer, and a bit of a heartless swine?or is he? As he guides us through some key events over a year or so in his life, he gives us pointers on how to be successful and confident in all you do. Offering advice on how to seduce, how to end a relationship, and much more, as the film draws on Alfie's world seems to fall apart around him, but still tries to hide his true emotions and play like he isn't affected.Alfie isn't a story based film. Without the talking to camera, and the knowing glances from time to time, it wouldn't be very interesting to watch.However, as with the Caine version, it is the wit, the banter, and the whole character of Law's Alfie that engrosses you. You can't help but be absorbed by the advice he is dishing out, and then actually start to care for this arrogant b**tard. Is Law as good as Caine? Not quite, but he offers a different kind of charm for a new era. The Caine film was firmly ground in the 60s, with Alfie a true hard-faced man of those times. Now attitudes have changed, and this Alfie is a new-man.What this film succeeds most in is showing us how all the points that were relevant in the 60s are still fresh today. A lot of attitudes towards the opposite sex still stand, although the film shows us that this works both ways now. Gone are the timid females of Caine's era, in steps Susan Sarandon.All in all I was pleasantly surprised by Alfie, and will no doubt see it again. The look of the film (with the use of billboards to show the focus of the next step of the film), and the charisma of Law, who delivers one of his rare good performances, keep you entertained. Go and see it before judging it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A castrated version of the classic original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first Alfie, everything about it epitomized the period in which it was filmed, cockney wideboys, birds, cars, humor and settings. And then there was the perfect actor at its centre, Michael Caine, his role as Alfie catapulted him into the big time, and today we have a remake with the next generation Caine, Jude Law. Jude Law could very well go on to equal and eclipse the success of Sir Michael Caine, he certainly has just as big a workload going on as Michael had in his early years, he has the charm intelligence and movie star looks in common with Caine, and if he plays his cards right will be able to compete at the highest level of actors on screen today just as Mr Caine never quite managed to do in Hollywood. Caine maybe made too many films and some of them were duds so his brilliance was never utilised fully in the states after the 70's.It is very fitting that Jude decided to step into Alfie's shoes after all of these years, it is a huge roll to step into and remake, and do you know what? I think they almost pulled it off, the film has the Hollywood gloss that the original never had, but that was part of its charm, a brit film with a brit actor with brit humour. The 2004 version is a very good movie and charts the success (in his eyes) and downfall of a young man at his most confident and arrogant stage. The "to the camera" acting from Michael Caine before this was the best it has ever been done on film, and Jude Law is just as good at it, he really did his homework. The problem with this film is it runs about 20mins too long and it really ponders too much on Alfie's mistakes, that we as an audience have already worked out for ourselves, its emphasizes the morals far too much, and goes to show how the sort of person Alfie is just cannot cope in modern society.Overall, some great performances from all of the principal cast, see Mr Wing!, not sure what all of the big words in the background are for on billboards etc. Where is Cilla Black? And Law is terrific as the new Alfie, give it a go.3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stronger than first appearances might suggest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first fifteen minutes of this film confirmed my initial fears about it. Jude Law stars as Alfie, a roguish Englishman living in Manhattan; a lowly chauffeur who is poor and lives in a flea-pit. Despite these apparent handicaps, Alfie has chicks swooning at every glance, and he appears to have more shags than hot dinners.He casts off conquests at the glimpse of a too-hairy arm, and forgets his dates' names almost as soon as as he discards them. Alfie is "semi-permanently" involved with Julie (Marisa Tomei), and has a key to her apartment, but only seems to go there when all else fails. When that relationship predictably is not enough for Julie, Alfie's main lament is that he may no longer see her young son, with whom he has formed a bond.Alfie does have dreams of improving his lot in life, and he and his pal Marlon, played to perfection by Omar Epps, have a plan to form their own business. Marlon has his own love problems, having just broken up with his sweetheart Lonette, and it is when Alfie tries to help his friend through these problems that the story takes a turn for the believable.The rest of the film is much more involving and realistic. The hedonistic Alfie finds that the world is not necessarily his for the taking, and that real relationships are made of gold, and like gold, are quite difficult to find.There are not a lot of similarities between this film and the earlier version, where Alfie was played by Michael Caine. One such similarity involves a sexy older woman, deliciously portrayed in this film by Susan Sarandon (Shelley Winters in the original), who makes quite an impression on Alfie.The second half of the movie is really quite well done, and Jude Law manages the task of moving Alfie's character on from a careless and carefree playboy extremely well. The scenes involving Alfie, Marlon and Lonette are pivotal to the whole movie and all three actors make these crucial scenes sizzle with emotion.If you can suspend disbelief for the first 15 to 20 minutes, you will find a worthwhile experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance is a Mary-go-round for Alfie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sly remake of the 1966 original that launched a career for Michal Caine. This time around, Jude Law plays Alfie, a Brit womanizer that takes the job of a chauffeur in New York City. Alfie flirts his way in and out of women's lives, barely reaching a deep relationship. His preference is beauty, boobs and bum. Law is charming and charismatic without coming close to mimicking Caine's performance. I somehow enjoyed Alfie looking at the audience and spouting his attitude and thoughts about his women. It was hard watching Alfie run into a stretch of not being able to "perform". And there is two things a lady's man doesn't want to hear..."you have a lump on your penis" and "I'm pregnant". Alfie finally begins facing his own mortality and realizes how effortless he hurt his women when dumping them. There is hope for the cockney lad after-all. Transition of scenes are a little imaginative and cool. I enjoyed the Mick Jagger musical interludes and Joss Stones modern version of the title track. Hey, what IS it all about Alfie? Jane Krakowski, Marisa Tomei and Nia Long make for a well rounded supporting cast. Also featured are: Omar Epps, Gedde Watanabe and Sam Vincenti.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's clear Hollywood hasn't learned its lesson. They can't remake any original Michael Caine movies, based on the dismal results of all the new versions. "The Italian Job", or even "Get Carter", in the hands of American movie people have turned out to be disappointments. Let's face it, it's hard anyone working in films today will ever match the charisma and fun that the young Michael Caine brought to all the films he made in England.Charles Shyer and Elaine Pope are credited as the adapters of this remake of the Bill Naughton's play of the same name. Terence Stamp made a great Alfie when he appeared as this picaresque character on the stage. Michael Caine went to make a name for himself as he was given the lead in the original production.There is nothing wrong with Jude Law's acting, but he just doesn't fill Mr. Caine's shoes, plain and simple. The direction by Mr. Shyer doesn't make things better. Some interesting supporting players were brought on board to try to give life to this picture, but nothing seems to work. We stayed away from watching this version during its release and only watched it the other night on cable when nothing else seemed worthwhile. A sad mistake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A player until he got played"I was almost sure I was going to like this movie, but not this much...You take a journey through a man's hardest times of life, based on his selfish habit of seducing women without the word of commitment living in his dictionary. Without commitment, you crawl yourself into a hole of of messed up relationships, whether it be because your partner finds out what kind of prick you are, or you find yourself more than attracted to this certain someone.Alfie, lives through these hard times, a good looking English man who women, to him, is his sex toy, whether he will admit it or not. He has on occasion experienced the natural side effects of relationships, something he doesn't wish explore further into. You could call it a bad thing, or a good thing. Alfie, believes it's not worth his time or interest Though despite his efforts, he can't get the ones he thinks he cares about out of his mind, and finds it more difficult to imagine of how to let them go. What's a man to do, dump that bitch and goon to the next one. Start things over again and make things more difficult. Getting others he cares about into the problem without intentionally meaning to.There's deep feelings of sorrow, grieve, anger, and a little pity going on as I watched this movie, and sometimes all at ounce. I highly recommend watching this movie for good reasons. The acting's great, the story's goods, the message is meaningful, and overall it's a good luck charm.Last message. Lets say if a beautiful woman (refering to Nikki) who moves into your apartment. Paints, and rearranges the place, makes you dinner, and tells you she is willing to try and do better. Become a better person, and as a bonus walks around topless. That to me is a once in a life time moment, and you can bet your ass I would give her that chance. I will never forgive Alfie for letting her go.***1/2/**** starsAlfie (2004): Rated R for sexual situations, nudity, brief language and drug use</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On it own terms, this movie is surprisingly good and I can't understand why it was savaged by a number of critics when it was released. It may be one of those quirky movies where myself and only a few others thought it really worked and the critics are right, but I thought it was quite original. It really walks the line well between being light/fun and a movie with content. It is not a shallow film. Jude Law is almost a perfect fit for the part and he does well in it, as do all the women characters. The movie is very stylish in pretty original ways. The stylishness was glamorized/fictional but not in a phony, gimmicky, or tragically hip sort of way. Some thought the characters were not fully developed, but I think that is consistent with Alfie's outlook/faults - we (the audience) would like to know the women more. The director portrays them so we would, but seen through Alfie's prism, we don't get that opportunity, although as he develops we do get to see additional character development. I thought this worked well in the film, but others might disagree. Where some saw a lack of plot, I thought the trajectory of the film also was well done and its ending was great, more true than simple problem - resolution type story lines. A final thought, at least one reviewer did not like the Stones/Dave Stewart soundtrack. Again, I loved it - the first Stones music in some time that I liked, particularly in the context of the film. Overall, I would recommend this film without hesitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When me and my family went to rent this movie I assumed I would be watching a typical chick flick; classy, with some funny jokes but in the end the guy and the girl. This was not at all the case. Alfie starts out alright, about an English womanizer living in New York City. But as the movie progresses, the movie becomes more and more slow paced and more and more preachy. There are also very few jokes. So in short: Reasons to see it: You either have nothing better t o do or you really like Jude Law. Reasons not to see: A lot of movies out there are a lot better than this. This movie was a big disappointment for someone like me who really enjoys a good romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfie has an audience for everyone. If you are married it makes you appreciate not being single. For the single women it gives you an honest and true insight on how men at the top of the physical perfection chain think. I am noticing in movies lately, that the happy ending, everything works out in the end, finales are over. More realistic, darker endings are taking their place. This movie is one of them. I am glad they ended this movie the way they did. This may be a possible SPOILER so be warned. The only unrealistic part in the movie was the confrontation with Susan Sarandon. A man who looks like Alfie and being a player that he was, wouldn't have gotten all bent out of shape over her.Jude Law's was very good. He was a very good choice to play the role. The supporting cast was also very good. Susan Sarandon makes turning 60 not so bad. I recommend this movie for all single women who want the heads up on how men think. Men will like it too because they can say they finally made a movie about how men act and think that is an honest portrayal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's to like about that Jude Law guy? He's handsome, talented, suave, rich, and British. That SOB! Actually, he doesn't coast on his looks and he's eager to play interesting supporting roles. Like Jude or not, I was initially reluctant to see this dude romance dozens of Manhattan lovelies in this '04 remake. A lot has changed since the original 'Alfie', the infamous '60s classic starring Michael Caine. That movie was made during the era of free love. These days, love is as expensive as everything else. That's the message of the Law movie too, which might explain why it made squat at the box office.That cynical edge is why I was pleasantly surprised by 'Alfie'. Law is not always likable in the title role and he does some lousy things, although he's not a wicked guy. His relationship with a dazzling loose cannon (Sienna Miller) gets the most exploration. She seems to be the woman of his dreams, but he eventually can't see past her flaws. Alfie also beds mega-rich Susan Sarandon, working-class single mom Marisa Tomei, married socialite Jane Krakowski, and his best friend's sexy girlfriend, Nia Long. That's quite a line-up of scores.Alfie is a simple limo driver who lives quite an extravagant lifestyle. Part of his problem is that he can't keep up with the women he wants. Through his many straight-on addresses to the camera, we learn that he's not completely shallow and he IS searching for love...not only for sex. Not that he doesn't have boatloads of great sex too. His seductive poolroom scene with Long is director Charles Shyer's best work in the entire movie. The result of that betrayal of his buddy (Omar Epps) turns out to be major plot point.I guess most guys want to be like Alfie (although they clearly didn't want to see him in a theatre). His life isn't as perfect as it looks and he doesn't have all the answers, but he seems to be growing up as he learns some tough lessons. The movie is not exactly joyful, which is understandable considering how lonely Alfie really is. He might be having the time of his life, but he isn't content. He pays for his mistakes, although I don't think living a hedonistic lifestyle is one of them. After all, he's not the only one there when he's having sex. So, basically, the movie is Jude Law and a bunch of gorgeous women. Very well. That's a pretty good drawing card right there.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, another bad footnote on Sherry Lansing's resume at that studio. You don't get too much of an idea of why any of these women would be especially compelling for Alfie, other than their looks. An all around waste of talent....And why, oh why, does Graydon Carter feel compelled to be an actor? Editing Vanity Fair doesn't keep him busy enough, I guess .What an ego! My advice...save your $10.25 and wait for the DVD or pay-per-view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toothless remake, a missed opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether or not you have seen or ever liked the original 'Alfie' starring Michael Caine, you are unlikely to get much out of this surprisingly disappointing film, unless you find the sight of Jude Law smirking his way through 90-plus minutes a turn-on. Clearly the writers/producers of this remake felt that the behaviour of the original Alfie - a cold-hearted sexual conqueror with, by today's standards, an appallingly chauvinistic attitude to women - would not be credible today. Either that or they felt that we in the audience would simply end up hating Jude Law, which, of course, we can never be allowed to do (stars are stars, after all - they have their public images to think of). So instead they give Alfie a soft-focus, almost Hugh Grant-style makeover, place him in New York (where his English manners inevitably come over as slightly quaint) and ask us to simply bask in his good looks and charm. The result is that this Alfie has no real dark side, not a whiff of the casual machismo that made Caine so compelling, and consequently no impact. Ironically, an updated remake could have been great. The attitudes Alfie exhibited in the original film are alive and well today - only buried beneath a surface of socially acceptable behaviour. Many men today would LOVE to be Alfie, if only they had the chance. And some women are even willing to play along. The question is: why? What's going on? Why haven't things changed? Or have they? There was a fantastically rich seam of material here, if only these film-makers had found the wit or the courage to exploit it. Instead they opted for a romantic comedy - only one with a serious lack of jokes. What next? Perhaps a remake of 'Schindler's List' where the camp guards only tickle their prisoners with feather dusters. Can't wait.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, this film is just awful. The plot was very dis-jointed and the passages of time were all over the place. I didn't feel any connection with any of the characters, especially not Jude Laws character and the whole film left me feeling empty and unfulfilled.The story doesn't really seem have any kind of message at the end and even if it does it wasn't really an obvious one. Jude law is certainly a handsome charmer and he isn't even a bad actor, i love him in I Heart Huckabees, but he doesn't seem to be able to pull of being this streetwise lovable cockney.It also would've been a lot less confusing if their weren't so many women that Alfie was involved with! There seemed to be so many, it was hard to keep track or even identify with any of them. This film was so disappointing. Because of the original I was expecting something half decent, instead we got a "chick flick" for women who find Jude Law attractive and an "all over the place" plot with a badly written script. Pathetic.One of the main things I think was that this film was so shocking in the 60's ~ it automatically turned into a classic because of this. The same shock value cannot be used today. Another of the many reasons the film failed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Reasonable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Manhattan, the British driver of limousine Alfie (Jude Law) is surrounded by beautiful women, most of them clients, and he lives as a Don Juan, having one night stand with all of them and without any sort of commitment. His girl-friend and single-mother Julie (Marisa Tomei) is quite upset with the situation and his best friends are his colleague Marlon (Omar Epps) and his girl-friend Lonette (Nia Long). Alfie has a brief affair with Lonette, and the consequences of his act forces Alfie to reflect and wonder about his life style.I have never had the chance to see the original "Alfie", and I found this remake only reasonable. I personally do not like remakes, and in this one the greatest attractions certainly are Alfie's women. They are extremely beautiful and sexy, but in my opinion the delicious Sienna Miller as Nikki is on the top of the ranking. The story has some funny moments, the open end fits adequately to the character of Alfie, but this movie is also forgettable and predictable. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Alfie"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jude Law... What is it about Jude Law I don't like? I think it might be that only women find him attractive and all men thinks he looks like the kid you'd happily ignore at school. We accept that Pitt, Clooney et al have that sex appeal that make women swoon, but LAW? He's just a....boy, right? And that's where this film fails. Whereas Michael Caine strutted those dark 60's rain-soaked streets in the original with the air of a MAN who really did have every woman in the palm of his hand only to see them all slip though his fingers, Law just doesn't have that gravitas. We don't believe that the womanly Marisa Tommei would sink into deep depression about his ambivalence. Or that Susan Sarandon would have anything more than a one-night with the cheeky young scamp. But hey, what do I know, after all Law is currently dating the pretty Sienna Miller who is one of his conquests in the film. And Law keeps nailing this big Hollywood roles like in 'I Heart Huckabees'... What's it all about indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different from the Original, but Great Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Alfie," played by Michael Caine, was more playful, and Michael Caine was more clueless about how hurtful his behavior was to his many women whom he called "Birds." The background of the original "Alfie" was London three decades ago, and Caine's cockney innocence and humor made for lots of fun. Jude Law's "Alfie" is more sensitive, and he is quicker to see the pain he causes and feels the poignant cost of being unable to commit to any relationship. The movie, in my view, is better because Mr. Law is more an organic part of his environment, and he displays more empathy. He is just as much a cad and a scoundrel as the original "Alfie." Mr. Caine's Alfie was a great portrayal and character study and should stand on its own. Caine's blue eyes light up the screen. "Alfie" is the unusual kind of movie where the protagonist speaks directly to the audience and takes us into his confidence. Jude Law's face, similarly, fills the screen with eye candy for women, and he is extremely engaging as he shares his secrets. The role is a demanding one that would be death to the movie if the lead were not played by someone as charming as Caine or Law with whom we would like to share intimate secrets. Both actors were, in my view, perfectly cast as handsome tom cats looking for love in all the wrong places.This remake is a gorgeous movie shot in New York City. There is a beautiful shot where Alfie sets out for a night on the town, and as he turns to walk up one of the streets of New York, the city lights come on in magical sequence. This is Oscar-worthy cinematography.The movie is sexy, filled with gorgeous women who are hot to trot. Alfie's charm is that he knows he is flawed, and he deals with it the best he can. He is not all that bright, and his women leave him behind as they grow up, and he does not. It is bittersweet comedy which makes your heart ache as you laugh.I have read the negative reviews of the viewers above, but I disagree. "Alfie" is one of the 2004's best movies, so far. There are many fine performances - by his girlfriend Merissa Tome, his best friend Omar Epps, his crazy but beautiful fling Sienna Miller, his best friend's girlfriend Nai Long, and the older woman Susan Sarandon. There could be several Oscar-worthy performances in this film including Mr. Epps, Nai Long and an exceptional performance by Sienna Miller, as the unstable but very sexy. Sarandon never looked better, and her remake performance (the Shelly Winters part) redefines the sexuality of older women.This a fine movies, and there is no disappointment here even when compared to the very fine performance of Michael Caine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good how-to movie is what's it all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the 1966 film with Michael Caine as Alfie. Jude Law now plays the title role of Alfie. The film uses the same speaking technique as the original, with Alfie talking directly to the camera when he is talking about women. The audience gets the inside information on women, as if we were part of the show. Alfie is from England living in Manhattan, working as a limousine driver. Alfie wants to some day own the limo business, but right now he is chauffeuring the rich around town, and sometimes making love to the lonely female passengers in the backseat of the limo. Alfie is very charming to women and knows what they want to hear. Alfie's goal is to make love to as many beautiful women as he can with no commitment or responsibilities, before he finds his soulmate. But Alfie finds that life is not that simple, and he will have to take responsibility for his actions.I thought the concept of talking to the audience works for this movie. The movie is a good how-to movie if you want to become a womanizer (player) in life; however, there are consequences. I think this remake may be better than the original.

		<shortDescription>Decent little film had a hard time finding an audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While moviegoers here in the US lined up to see a very mediocre horror film called "Saw" last fall, this film starring Jude Law went almost unnoticed. I find that unfortunate since it is a well-acted character study of a truly engaging individual. The film lost one hell of a lot of money.Alfie is a limo driver in NYC who uses his charm to make out like a bandit with various women whenever he gets the chance. Jude Law has this character down perfectly. He's just too damn charming for his own good. Most of us guys wouldn't stand a chance against him. I never saw the original, so I'm not sure how Michael Caine did with his performance, but Law is quite good in this version. Despite his charm, Alfie has a very strong fear of any type of commitment. Even when he really likes a woman, he always backs out of the relationship when he senses things are getting too close.The film has an appealing cast, and that is one of its strongest assets. Not only does Law shine, but so do most of the female characters he charms. There are some problems, however. The film contains two subplots that are played way up, then dropped abruptly. In one, Alfie impregnates his best friend's woman during a brief separation of their relationship. Alfie is under the impression that the woman has the child aborted, but we later find that not to be the case. There are all kinds of issues brought about by the birth of this child (it is bi-racial, for example), but the film seems to abandon the issue just like Alfie abandons his women. In another subplot, Alfie becomes temporarily impotent. This leads him to a doctors office visit in which a lump is discovered in his private parts area. Does he have some kind of cancer? Nope, he ends up being just fine, but a little more resolved to live more cleanly. This subplot also gives him the opportunity to meet an old man who conveniently gives him some advice later in the film. Other than that, these subplots really don't contribute much to the story.The ending was handled correctly. I feared for a moment that the film was going to chicken out and go for the traditional happy ending that so many films have to have. But it didn't happen. Alfie is left confused and alone. He still hasn't figured out the question posed by the film's tag line.Why did this movie fail? Well, I'd have to chalk that up to the fact that this film really isn't made for a wide niche of people. Most men would look at this as a "date movie" and be scared off. Women probably aren't interested in seeing a film about a guy who screws around and DOESN'T find true love in the end. Overall, I'd say give it a chance. It's technically well made, and well acted. That's more than you can say for a lot of films these days.7 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lord, but this was boring! This was a messy movie, veering from one style to another. It crammed in product endorsements by the second, then going into an stylised montage in a homage to the swinging 60s, before ending up sentimental and weepy the next scene. TOO many scenes were stopped short or faded out and felt unfinished.The cliché-ridden songs whining in the background were DIRE ('like the blind leading the blind...old soldiers never die...etc'). You're left gasping to hear the original theme tune, Joss Stone's capable version of which is BURIED at the END of the closing credits.Can someone please explain why they bothered filming in England? I remember them spending so much time and money turning Manchester's Northern Quarter into Greenwich Village, which ended up being used in maybe 5 minutes of footage (the coffee shop and restaurant scenes with Marisa Tomei).What WERE the fat florist and the German doctor DOING in this movie??? It was like something from the Carry On films and another indication of the unevenness of the whole production.And just think of poor Sadie Frost, having to watch Sienna's nips wiggling around in Jude's face!A woman sat behind me sobbed through the second half (feeling sorry for Jude, which I'm not sure was the POINT), while a bloke sat next to me snickered. So much for being the perfect 'date' movie...but I'm sure it will do okay business for a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Alfie" is about a New York chauffeur, the title character, who seems to measure his self worth in terms of his sexual conquests. He judges women superficially, primarily in terms of their physical attractiveness or social status. We see Jude Law, in the role of Alfie, sleep with a number of women and turn to the camera repeatedly, dispassionately analyzing each woman's pros and cons ("pros" would be good legs, no kids, wealthy, no wrinkles,etc.)I really had a problem with this movie. First of all, Alfie speaks to the camera repeatedly and it becomes very annoying after 15 minutes. And there's close to two hours to go of the same thing! Aaaaagh! I imagined Jude Law saying to the director, "Do I really have to keep talking to the camera? Can't I just ACT?" Besides being annoying, this plot device was B-O-R-I-N-G.Second, the film is supposed to take place in New York. Then why not shoot it in New York? The ambiance of New York is unique and exciting. But unfortunately, the film was shot in England.Also, this is too much of a one-note movie. We get the point that Alfie has surface relationships very early on. The director doesn't have to make that point ad infinitum.There are two interesting subplots in the film. One involves Marisa Tomei (sorry, can't recall her character's name), a single Mom whom Alfie discards. The second involves Susan Sarandon (can't recall her character's name, either!) who is an elegant, "well preserved," 50-something woman whom Alfie thinks is one of his conquests. I don't want to include any spoilers, but in my opinion, the story line in the second half of the movie that involves Alfie's relationships with these women is the only reason to see the film.Overall, I'd give the movie 2 stars, and perhaps 2 1/2 if I was stretching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Original Is Watered Down into A Chick Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why turn "Alfie" into a chick flick? Maybe for those who mis-remembered the bright, scabrous, creative original. I'm finding that most reviewers are remembering it incorrectly, whereas I saw it for the first time the weekend before I saw this too-pretty make-over. Most reviewers remember it as black-and-white, which it wasn't. Most remember it as reflective of the Swinging '60's of London, but the mise en scene was London at the cusp, as attitudes were just starting to change, so characters were flopping in moral confusion.Most remember the women as pre-liberation, but their passivity was more complicated; Alfie had an unerring ability to hone in on women with horrificallly low self-esteem, regardless of their marital or economic status. Michael Caine is such an established actor now, none remember that he was not a conventionally handsome lead to be conquering all these women, let alone that he was a cocky Cockney like the Angry Young Man of the period kitchen sink British dramas. Few remember just how heartless he was - calling all his conquests "it". None seem to remember how vividly babies and abortion figure into the plot, a la "Vera Drake." The new version is confused about all these elements. The cinematography is beautiful, but has to cover up for the fact that while it supposedly takes place in New York City, it was actually filmed in Manchester, England so is missing atmosphere that's so critical to the same ground that's trod in "Sex and the City;" frequent background mattes of the Brooklyn Bridge are weak atmosphere-builders . And this is also some sort of retro NYC that allows smoking in bars and doesn't require helmets on mopeds, which is also a retro means of individual transport. The film probably takes place in the '00's - but the flashy split screens and the women's make-up and styles are retro-'60's. "Keen Eddie"'s Sienna Miller is made up as a duplicate of the original's Jane Asher. Marisa Tomei even has her hair in a flip with a wide head band and Nia Long is made up like "Cleopatra Jones" from the early '70's. At least one time we do get a glimpse of a condom package, but that's only obvious now because films today show them, not that they weren't used in the '60's; it does take place in post Roe v. Wade NYC. The women's personality upgrades are inconsistently effective and there's no drama to how the incredibly beautiful, posh-sounding Jude Law captures them.Susan Sarandon's self-assured, independent entrepreneur is a sexy, believable update of Shelley Winters' rich widow, making her closing dig at Alfie as a gigolo even more devastating. Miller's character is now trendily manic depressive, or some such chemically-dependent disorder, rather than just an insecure runaway, which weakens Alfie's hold on her; that character's passive aggressive manipulation of him and how she bypasses him to straighten out her life are missing completely, so we lose some insight into both his cruelty and comeuppance. Long's character's crisis is weakened from the original's, as her pregnancy conflates two different affairs, with the emphasis instead put on male friendship betrayal, the friend that this "Alfie" claims in passing calls his women "it". "Alfie"'s health scare had to be updated from TB, and the cancer testing is done for laughs; the lack of mention of Viagra is odd if it is in fact taking place now. Here the older male confidante is stuck in deus ex machina, rather than in plot context. While the original stands up 35 years later as a mordant and brilliant, matter of fact presentation of "moral lapses," the mild update is considerably weakened and Hollywoodized as respectable company, such that the finale doesn't even segue smoothly into the first musical line of "What's it all about?" The soundtrack selections are otherwise excellent, but as confusingly retro as the rest of the atmosphere, with neo-soul teen Joss Stone singing and Mick Jagger collaborating with Dave Stewart on originals that sound old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and this time it's a good one!I am not a fan of the original version of this movie, so I wasn't expecting much of anything from this film as I don't really think much of Jude Law either.It was nice to be pleasantly surprised. Jude Law portrayed Alfie - the selfish, womanising, obnoxious limo driver - and we saw how he went thru a life changing experience and became a better, if single, man in the end.All of the actors in this film did an excellent job and the director was fantastic, considering how irritating it generally is to have a lead character talking directly to camera in a movie. Somehow, Jude Law managed to be obnoxious in his role, and endearing at the same time - no mean feat really.There could even be a nomination in this movie for Jude, as it is a unique style of movie making where we are only ever in the head of the main character and never see anything from the point of view of any other character - you have to be a good actor to carry an entire movie by yourself in this way.This movie is well worth seeing and does not have the classic Hollywood style happy ending either - thank God - if it had, it would have ruined the entire thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good balance! light-hearted fun &amp; deeper character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should probably start off by saying I haven't seen Michael Caine's version of Alfie. Without anything to compare it to, I surprisingly enjoyed this film. I NEVER write these kind of comments, but I have seen many Jude Law movies in the past and was not at all disappointed with his performance (as it seems others are with this film). He is very believable, fits the part, and most of all, I really felt/saw his character development! I mean, isn't that what most film critics criticize in a bad movie...the lack of meaning/character development? It was much more than a light comedy, it was deeper than that, it held more personal issues and wasn't the typical 'guy ends up w/ girl romantic comedy' it was made out to be. thank goodness! The narration, monologues and direct contact with the camera doesn't happen to often in movies, so I quite enjoyed its different style and pace. You really felt as if you were along for the ride. I don't think the movie ever really 'slowed down', it kept a good pace without getting impatient. I loved Marissa Tomei, she's just brilliant! Susan Surrandon and Siena Miller, also portray very real, believable characters. Also, the film editing and style of graphics on its different screen display was quirky and fun! It definitely brought more to the film.All in all, I found Alfie to be a 'breath of fresh air,' a pleasant surprise, a good balance of light-heartedness fun and more serious, thought-provoking issues not to be taken lightly. And in my mind, it did not in the least diminish Jude Law's respectability as an actor. It is ever more apparent he has great talent and not all looks. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could only write one word review for this film I could do it...boring...I mean as with any film it has it's ups and downs and parts of it are somewhat entertaining...hence the 5/10 and not lower. It has a plot, a very thin plot and Jude Law is acceptable although I find him kind of intolerable in most situations and considering he's in so much I have learned to tolerate him. He's probably the best choice for this role though which I don't know if it's a compliment or insult? Alfie is the story of playboy, cad, Alfie. He lives in New York City and he loves women...or he loves seducing them, being with them, sleeping with them, and putting notches on his bedpost...not literally...I don't think. We are brought into the point in Alfie's life where things are about to take a turn. As is bound to happen with people of his freewheeling lifestyle he's about to get his wake up call...his boost of maturity that will give him the life lesson he doesn't want. Suddenly when his casual sex partner (one who thinks of him as her boyfriend) breaks up with him, he finds himself unable to perform with the myriad of women he wants to see. Upon visiting a doctor he is faced with the scare of cancer, and after that he gradually begins to realize what a waste his life is alone going from woman to woman. He tries to find a woman from all his women to settle down with but each and everyone one of them manage to give him a taste of his own medicine inadvertently until he is basically left alone and realizing how petty his life has been.Great moral!! I will say that. Especially nowadays where people seem to spend days in a relationship before moving on to another. There is a great message of true love here without ever being show true love. Charles Shyer who is the director and writer of two of my favorite family films...Father of The Bride 1 and 2, as well as The Parent Trap should know all about remakes. I have not seen the original Alfie and probably never will because I have a feeling this is one film that should not have been remade. The story, despite being interesting enough, relies completely on the characters. We need characters who are just non stop watchable and Jude Law, Susan Sarandon, Jane Krakowski, Marisa Tomei, Omar Epps and Nia Long along with the other cast members are not!! Not one of them is intriguing or watchable and they aren't bad but they aren't good either. The film is just plain BORING!!! The story is all it has going for it and it's just not enough. I hopefully will never have to sit through it again...bypass this one...go for Spanglish!!! 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We had to choose a movie for a Sunday afternoon. It had to be something domestic, some nice and easy... We chose Alfie, as we did not have many choices and it seemed to fit the description. We had had a long day so we only managed to stay awake for as long as we ate the cornflakes (the first half of the movie) and then... nothing managed to kept us awake.To me, the only good points of the movie were: 1. It was shot in New York, and it's always nice to see again the Brooklyn Bridge :p.2. 'It's OK, son, you screwed it. We all make mistakes, it's more important what you do next'. The philosophy of the whole movie comprised in a single phrase at the end of it. If only, those who needed this, heard these lines and gathered their meaning.Tonight, we'll go see Mike Nichols' 'Closer' which sounds more promising.</fullReview>

He was overshadowed every time he shared the screen; especially with Omar Epps. Omar is a wonderful actor with a great range that does not rely on his looks in the pathetic way that Law does.Alfie was probably innovative when the original was done. Sometimes even there have been some remakes that are just as good or even better than the original. However, this was obviously about the paycheck and not an homage.

		<shortDescription>What IS it all about...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot express how totally disappointed, yet not surprised, I was with this movie. Having seen the fabulous Michael Caine in the original many years ago, and alternately being intrigued and appalled that a remake was being done, I still felt unexplicably compelled to see it for myself. This is a perfect example of trusting ones first instinct, mine being to stay home. Talk about unsympathetic characters! I could not find one thing to like about Alfie, save looking at Jude Law's eyes. I even found the constant narrative annoying, but the worst of it was that I left still not knowing for sure whether or not Alfie had learned and experienced enough to make any real lasting change in his treatment of women and relationships. There's about three minutes of that "Awwww....." feeling, when he is feeling a bit of karma, but frankly, it wasn't enough to make me remotely like him. Marisa Tomei has been missed, and was wasted in too little screen time. Ditto for Susan Sarandon, who seems lately to have not much more than cameo roles (case in point: Shall We Dance?). This was a waste of a lot of money and way too much of my time. It seemed like it would never end, and when it did, I knew little more and cared a lot less about Alfie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's it all about? Indeed; Law acquits himself in another pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ALFIE (2004) **1/2 Jude Law, Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon, Nia Long, Sienna Miller, Jane Krakowski, Omar Epps, Gedde Watanabe, Dick Latessa, Renee Taylor. Law is tailor-made in this straining-to-be-credible remake of the film that launched Michael Caine as a movie star in this dramedy about an English rake ? this time transplanted in the hobnobbing, hustling-bustling NYC ? who bounds from one bed to another, seducing women to his natural charms yet ultimately being morally bankrupt. Law's Alfie however is handed some life-lessons that attempt to balance out his cheeky aplomb with the ladies being virtual catnip and his boundless energy makes up for some of the plotting and creaky cinematic devices (the breaking of the fourth wall is relied upon too much) that filmmaker Charles Shyer ? who co-scripted with Elaine Pope ? manages to be something of an effort in spite of his leading man's affable, dapper self-indulgency.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is it about? *spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfie (2004) is a long, rambling film that attempts to accomplish too much by giving too little. I disliked this movie primarily because the script is a structure- lover's nightmare. Plot points are not organized well and there are no strong indications of when one act ends and another begins. Too much of the film is based on coincidence and not nearly enough of the film focuses on secondary characters. I cannot imagine who would let such a script through. Also, the film beats the viewer over the head with its ideology. Billboards with key words lie all around and the most obvious actions are made more obvious by being talked about. And worst of all, if you don't see the last line coming from a mile away, you need to prep yourself more before going to a film. Despite all this, there are a few things of note.The director brings an unconventional, but not unoriginal, style, mixing elements from, and are better used in, "Down with Love" and "The Rules of Attraction" (among other quirky contemporary films). A few times this got distracting, but the film always keeps in mind it is a film (and, therefor, the viewer also always remembers the format). Most of the acting is fine, but I'm not sure why everyone is so excited about Susan Sarandon. I thought her performance was nominal.I don't know who would want to go see this film. It's too serious for a chick/date flick, not serious enough for a comedy, and written horribly enough that it does nothing but harm the art of film. There are many better movies out there. Don't even bother with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yawn, kind of a chick flick with the predictable "man bad woman good" plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: While I don't specifically explain the lame ending I will go into a few general details of the movies direction which makes it obvious. I suppose if you saw the original 1960's movie you won't be surprised anyways.Well, after reading a few reviews I thought the movie sounded kind of interesting. I was lead to believe that it was a more realistic portrayal of modern sexually active single men. This would be a refreshing change from the media created "sensitive, metrosexual male" that most women like to say they want but in reality is NOT what get's their juices flowing. It would also be a nice departure from the totally unrealistic and common plot of the spineless pussywhipped guy seeing the error of his ways of actually(gasp)thinking about other women and therefore, winning the leading ladies heart.Neither of these scenarios could be further from the truth. It ends up portraying the guy as both a metrosexual male and, towards the end, a spineless pussywhipped pathetic loser. It is a movie about a shallow playboy told mostly from the womans point of view IMHO. This is somewhat cleverly disguised as the playboy himself describing his thoughts throughout the movie. Guys, I don't think you will like it and I wouldn't really suggest it as a date movie either. It is the sort of movie a bunch of women would go to to help them forget about a recent failed or failing relationship to make themselves feel better about themselves.Now, I do realize that it is a remake of a 1960's movie and they sort of tried to keep it in line with that but I don't care. That is not the way it was advertised to get me to see it. To the movies credit, they do throw in one psycho girlfriend and one cougar (older woman that likes to indulge in much younger men)to show that women are not all good and men are not all bad. In the end, the guy is the loser and all the women that mean't anything to him move on. It was just a real downer for me and not realistic at all IMHO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfie was not the best movie in the world, to be blunt. Jude law is SO cute but even someone that hot did not keep my interest. he did not show much talent in this movie and the whole bit with him having cancer was UTTERLY pointless. sarandon was pretty good but not amazing, and i think they could have made more use of her. tomei was a waste of time and just did not keep my interest at ALL. i wanted to fast forward her scenes. miller showed a little too much (though for Jude ...) and did well for her small role. she does have a talent and potential in acting. and her outfits were cute. long was just plain annoying. epps was good in the scene where he sees Alfie again but i just did not like him all that much. to me, the best performer in the movie was Jane krakowski. she always plays her roles well and for her cameo she did VERY well. u think the relationship is all sex but it is obvious she was wounded when she came back. she handles it well, wounded but it doesn't end life, which is what her roles usually do. she is very good and there is more depth to Dorie than just *good legs* but then again i am a woman and the only times i look at woman's legs are to compare them against my own. just kidding. Jane was great and there was an interesting storyline within her 15 minutes. i think it was ridiculous that Alfie learnt nothing from his past. it was not a good film and in my opinion it was only for the eye-candy (Jude) and Jane krakowski. miller was good too. but nia long will drive u nuts! i haven't seen the first so i cant compare!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>get a money-back guarantee first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I asked for my money back, but they refused. Don't make the same mistake.I wanted to see Alien vs Predator, but my other half wanted to see this, so, to throw the dog a bone, I aquiesced. Sheer torture. After 10 minutes I was struggling, but kept my peace. After an hour, she suggested that, and I'm really paraphrasing here "this isn't great. Shall we leave, and not waste another hour" (there was more foul language, but like I said I was paraphrasing). I jumped at the chance. Surprisingly few other people left.Now, this is only the second film I've ever walked out of (first one 'Eyes wide shut'. I can sit through real garbage. I even managed to sit all the way through 'the Piano' for goodness' sake. But this was excruciating. Jude Law is terrible at the whole Alfie thing. The story is painful. I guess everyone else did their best, but there wasn't much to work with.I don't imagine AVP will be better, but at least it'll keep my attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing stellar.For me, 'Alfie' leaves too much open. Too many characters are under-developed, and the only one who wasn't Alfie, leaves something to be desired. You never know if the directors intentions are for us to feel bad for him, or envy him. Maybe both. One this is for sure; for a movie that goes nowhere, has a weak ending, pointless conversations, no action and leaves you wanting more... a 5 out of 10 is pretty generous. However, the movie does evoke SOME emotion for those who have ever been in his place.Unfortuantly, there really isn't enough here to satisfy anyone in my opinion, due to a poor script (though I didn't see the original). Acting for the parts was believable, though I don't see any Oscars coming.Overall not worth the watch.-WarTowels</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I knew this movie would bomb before it came out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote a review of this film while in production 3 years ago, What I wrote then turned out to be true. To tell you the truth, any fool can see it would bomb, if you saw the production values on the set where the film was made. One location was in the centre of Manchester,England, just behind where I used to work. It was great having the film people there at first, but then as the days wore on the security at the behest of law were getting very intimidating, and fights nearly broke out with members of the public where watching the shooting of the film. Most of use were office people and was just curious as to what was going on. Nobody was that interested in law but it was a nice bonus for the city of Manchester. Then things got bad, law complained the public was too close, security guards were threatening people with Phyisical Assualts if they film or took pictures on the streets. It got so bad I complain to Manchester City Council representative for the film and arts media at the time. He stated quite clearly no one should of been stopped from taking photo, shooting videos etc or to be intimidated by the film crew. Some of this has been echo else where on the net, by some guy who lived on the street (opposite the make up Cafe, now car park). Lots of thugs being employed by the law gangsters, who threatened the public etc. It totally put me off Law and his films now I would avoid watching them like the plague. Before this I respected him as an actor and like his films ESP the talented Mr Ripley and enemy at the gates. This experience left with a big bad taste in my mouth about how the film industry really regards us. best wishes</fullReview>
