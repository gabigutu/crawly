		<shortDescription>More than a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this marvellous film again last night, I began to think about how peculiar that a film which has so severely dated in so many respects still manages to say something profound today. In certain respects, this film just couldn't be done today. First of all, gender roles have changed a great deal, and many of Alfie's "birds" simply wouldn't be plausible in a modern film. Second of all, sex has changed so much. Back in the 80s, we had plenty of films (usually bad ones) which took a similarly cavalier attitude toward sex, but that's a relic of a simpler, pre-HIV world that's gone forever. But "Alfie" still manages to say something, even to a modern audience. On one hand, it's got a very funny script, and Michael Caine plays Alfie with such an infectious charm that it's impossible not to smile. But also, there's a deeper layer of meaning to the film. "I never mean to hurt anyone," Alfie says. "I know," says Harry, "but you do." Alfie ignores this lovely and rare moment of real honesty, but the audience shouldn't, because the heart of the film is right here. Alfie himself is such a fascinating character. At first, he seems like simply a rogue, a rascal. But there's a helluva lot going on under the surface. His deep, deep insecurities, his tragic loneliness (he wouldn't see it that way, naturally), his pathological inability to have a real relationship with anyone. Especially his own son, whom he obviously loves very much. While it's easy to see "Alfie" as a tragic story and feel sympathy for the character, it's important to hold onto the hatred. Alfie is a cruel, merciless, and heartless man. He is self-absorbed, utterly insensitive, and totally domineering. He cheerfully holds his "birds" to standards of loyalty he himself needn't bother with. He ruthlessly undermines the individuality and autonomy of everyone he is with, even when pretending to be a liberating force. Notice in his scenes with Gilda how his words sound as though he's endorsing freedom, independence, and self-determination, but the effect of those words is to keep her right under his thumb where she belongs. Alfie deserves our sympathy, yes, but he also deserves our hatred, loathing, and utter contempt. Anyway, like the DVD box says, this is just a sweet, frothy little comedy, if you like, and it's very enjoyable as such. But, if you care to look deeper, there is so much more to behold. The tagline to "American Beauty" was "look closer", but all of its profound ideas and insights (if any) were plastered right across the screen. "Alfie" is a film which asks you to look closer, and it rewards the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Lewis Gilbert. Written by Bill Naughton. Running time: 114 minutes. Classified PG.Alfie is a fantastic example of what I would call a perfect movie: it has a message, it states it clearly, it mixes humor with poignancy, and it's highly stylistic. And did I happen to mention that Michael Caine is in it? The story of the film revolves around a selfish cad (an exceptional Caine) who takes advantage of nearly every woman he encounters and, as a result, is eventually left alone. While Alfie has some very funny moments, it is far from being a comedy: at heart, it is a grim drama about the consequences of selfishness. From the opening scene -- an overview of London at night leading to a shot of Caine and one of his mistresses attempting to copulate in a car -- to the rather dismal conclusion -- another shot of London at night with Caine pondering the meaning of life -- Alfie is directed with flair and elegance. The cinematography is outstanding and the accompanying jazz score establishes an appropriate mood. Each performance is terrific in its own way: Shelley Winters is flawless as Alfie's counterpart, and Graham Stark (a recurring star in Blake Edwards' films) turns in a great supporting role as the ethical husband of one of Alfie's lovers. The script is taut, well-written, and highly influential (Alfie's occasional monologue to the camera is a technique that has been replicated countless times in modern films). Screenwriter Bill Naughton also made the clever decision to assign no last names to any of the principal characters. The only part with a surname belongs to Alfie Bass, who portrays a hospitalized father that stands out as the only truly virtuous character in the entire picture. There are some very light and witty moments in the film, but the scenes that stand out the most are the powerful ones revolving around Viven Merchant's abortion. Director Lewis Gilbert made the wise decision to not show anything explicit, but in the process he made these scenes increasingly haunting and heart-breaking. The shot that focuses on Caine's face as his emotions melt at the sight of his unborn child is remarkably intense. Over-all, Alfie is intriguing, entertaining, and oddly touching. Its influence can be seen in practically every romantic comedy since its release (even High Fidelity owes much of its success to this gem). Alfie went on to score five Oscar nominations, including nods for the extraordinary performances of Caine and Merchant.**** - Classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic study of 60s manners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only realised last night that I had not seen Alfie all the way through, but I'm glad I did now. This was a real eye-opener, not only from a historical point of view but also proof once again that Michael Caine is a British treasure, and one of the screen greatest actors.I read the script for the original play a few years ago and found that I totally disliked the character of Alfie. But seeing Caine playing the role, and although I didn't like his whole attitude to women (calling them "it"), you cannot but like him. Caine plays the cheeky chappy so well that it's no wonder women would fall for his charm.But the true taste of the pudding is the scene after the abortion, when Alfie enters the kitchen. A truly emotional sequence that shows the true power of Caine's acting ability.It was also an interesting study of life in 60s London. Not the swinging, hippy sixties of Carnaby Street that is so often shown in most 60s London films. And as a piece of historical social study, you can't get better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent introduction to Michael Caine's work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen most of Michael Caine's work before, it was a pleasant surprise to see one of his first films. You can tell that it is one of his early roles and was not made with a large budget, but, as a good film should portray, it is quite clearly the quality of the script and the acting that outshines the sets and other superfluous aspects.Caine's character is inherently unlikeable, but, he exudes such a strong charisma that one warms to him gradually. The films choice of supporting actress is also well done as they are controlled by Caine's character, but not upstaged.The ending, for me is the key point in liking Caine's character, as without spoiling the film, the final scene, set against the Thames at night, is an outstanding piece of writing and direction.Alfie is an excellent introduction to Michael Caine's work and, for all its flaws, it remains an outstanding film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great period piece dealing with universal questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has long been one of my favorites. It is one of the few quintessentially "60's" movies, using filming methods that were quite unusual at the time (the direct dialogue between the main character and the audience, for example). While its style is clearly confined to that era, and England in particular, its subject matter is profoundly universal.The subjects of love and devotion, or more accurately their opposites, philandering and infidelity, are treated with a unique sensitivity in the script. Michael Caine is at once both lovable and detestable, perfectly characterizing the age-old dynamic between the need for love and the need for physical pleasure. But this is not a feel-good movie, it is a movie that explores the difficult decisions that confront a person as they mature in both life and love, and it conveys the basic feelings that are present in all human beings, regardless of outward appearances.I would recommend this as a thought-provoking exploration of human nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of Caines best films and proof that with the right material he can be a very good actor. The story is based on the popular 1960's British theme of human emotions and how the central character faces up to their shortcomings. Alfie, the character, is a dinosaur by today's standards, but there were, and still are men who behave in this way. The film broke new bounds at this time, particularly with the abortion scene. It is said that many cinema-goers walked out in disgust at this harrowing point in the film. How times change. Denholm Elliot's short performance as the sleazy abortionist is worth a mention here as it captures the filthiness of the moment perfectly.In fact all the supporting roles are excellent. As a period 1960's piece, the film is almost flawless and Sonny Rollins' jazzy soundtrack is beautiful. The ending of the film is very moving with Caine summing up his life and the arty end credits being run whilst Cher sings Burt Bacharach's "Alfie" theme tune. Watch it and your views on life will change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just managed to pick this film up on DVD for a bargain price for what is a classic in any era. The way the film is shot, Caine's acting and the music score just draw you in to Alfie's tale. The film does not hide from the grim consequences of Alfie's selfish life but at the end of it you feel sorry for him as his life is really empty as a result. A Film with a message &amp; Caine is mesmerising in the lead role. Great soundtrack from Jazzman Sonny Rollins &amp; the end theme by Burt Bacharach (and sung by Cher) is a classic ballad that leaves you in deep though after what you have seen ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a seriously good comedy. Michael Caine is delightfully saucy as the title character. He ought to seem a cad, and at times he is, but he takes his lumps too, and takes them in stride. The supporting cast is very effective, with especially excellent performances by Jane Asher, Shelley Winters and Millicent Martin. The camera work is also notable, and London serves as an effective backdrop. Definitely worth a look, and a reminder Michael Caine was as good then as he is now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rogue on the loose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfie Elkins, that irresistible roguish Cockney character, takes us into his confidence right at the start of this film, as he invites us, his audience, to follow him in this fantasy filled with sex that reflected a Mod society of London in the sixties. Alfie, by talking directly to the camera, seems to be performing asides a character would do in a play to emphasize a point. Some comments in here indicate they are an annoyance, but in fact, they enhance the charm of Alfie. He is a happy go lucky man who scores with all kinds of women, who find him, not only attractive, but hard to forget. Alfie is not bashful in telling us his sexual encounters with the women we get to meet.Lewis Gilbert's 1966 film made an impact when it was released. Watching it in the DVD format, one can clearly see the film has been preserved well. It still has a crisp look and frankly, it doesn't have that "dated" look of other films of that period. Aside from some of those 60s hair styles, seen in some of the actresses, the film looks as though it was recently shot.This is a film to relish Michael Caine in one of his best creations. As Alfie, he is never mean. He is a man who is only interested in satisfying the women he meets. This was Mr. Caine's break through film, which indicated, even then, his potential as the versatile actor one has always cherished.The women in Alfie's life show a lot of different types. Shelley Winters is at her best with her take of Ruby, the wealthy American "bird" that loves her encounters with Alfie. Millicent Martin, seen briefly, makes a fun Siddie. Vivian Merchant is Lily, the married woman who strays when she can't resist Alfie's charms. Jane Asher as Annie is excellent. Julia Foster plays Gilda, the only one to give Alfie an heir. Eleonor Bron is seen briefly. Alfie Bass is the only actor who has any extended role in the film.This is a film that reflects that sexual liberating era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfie is a difficult film to come to terms with as it is most definately not what it seems. Its at its most base level is a movie about an arrogant womanising Jack the Lad, whose only virtue is his rogueism. However In my opinion it is an educated, witty, and ironic journey through the male ego during the sixties/seventies. Alfie is a tragic coming of age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caine's star making role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were many films that capitalized on the mod-scene in London during the swinging 60's but very few of them have stood the test of time but this film remains as a solid reminder of how morals and ethics were starting to be portrayed in films and the main reason it still holds up is the unabashed performance of the lead. Story is about Alfie Elkins (Michael Caine) who is the ultimate ladies man in London and he seems not to just conquer his women but to own them as well. Even when living with someone he still keeps his options open and has a few ladies on the side from Gilda (Julia Foster) to the American Ruby (Shelley Winters) who is actually much like Alfie herself.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Alfie ends up getting Gilda pregnant and she eventually has a boy that he learns to care for but he doesn't have any aspirations of getting married and Gilda later marries another man. Alfie ends up in the hospital with an infection and while there he meets Lily (Vivien Merchant) who's the wife of his roommate and later starts an affair with her. He also meets a hitchhiker named Annie (Jane Asher) who tries to make him feel more domesticated but Alfie gets fed up and forces her to leave but he also gets Lily pregnant and helps her get an illegal abortion and it's at this point that Alfie starts to think about his life and where he's going.This film is directed by Lewis Gilbert who is a very talented and respected director who would work with Caine again in the future with "Educating Rita". This script is from Bill Naughton and his play and at times the film has a stage feel especially when Caine turns to the camera and talks to the audience about his inner thoughts. The character Alfie is depicted in a brutally honest manner and the best way to describe him is either as a cad or a rogue but this is partly why Caine's performance is so riveting. Caine was a working actor but after this film was released it made him a worldwide star and gave him a celebrity status where he never had to look back. Caine's screen presence is part of his performance and the way he can look at the camera and stay in character can be hard to pull off but Gilbert's intuition in casting Caine was correct and ultimately vital to the film. This is Caine's first great performance and he does add many layers to his character from being incredibly selfish and cynical to moments of remorse and disgust of his own actions. The supporting cast is also excellent and actress Merchant is nothing short of memorable with her role as a vulnerable middle age woman. This film is almost 40 years old and was made when morals and ethics were being questioned and along with Caine's unflinching performance this still holds up very well after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Side of the Sexual Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine made several good films in the sixties and early seventies, such as "Zulu", "The Ipcress File" and "Get Carter", but in my opinion "Alfie" is his best from this period, and only equalled among his later films by "Hannah and Her Sisters" and "Educating Rita". It is set in what might be described as the kitchen sink end of swinging London. The anti-hero, Alfie Elkins, is a young working-class Cockney who works as a mechanic and driver for a car-hire company. In some respects the film looks back to the social-realist school of the late fifties and early sixties. Alfie is in some ways a very traditional character. He lives in the sort of drab, seedy flat familiar from "kitchen sink" realist films and hangs out in old-fashioned East End pubs rather than discos. He dresses smartly but conservatively, at one stage even sporting an RAF blazer. Not for him the long hair, sideburns, bell-bottom jeans, loud shirt and kipper tie which constituted the uniform of the sixties trend-setter.In one respect, however, he is very different to the traditional social-realist hero. The "angry young men" from films such as "Look Back in Anger", "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning", "The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner" and "Room at the Top" were characterised by anger and resentment against the Establishment. Resentment is an emotion quite alien to the happy-go-lucky Alfie, whose main preoccupation is not settling scores with "the system" but rather scoring with women. He is a practised seducer, and the film introduces us to a number of his conquests. The nearest thing he has to a steady girlfriend is Gilda, the mother of his young son Malcolm, but even she tires of his infidelity and refusal to commit to her. Eventually she leaves him to marry her long-time admirer, bus conductor Humphrey. Humphrey is everything Alfie is not; he is far from handsome, but is caring, faithful and deeply in love with Gilda. Alfie suffers a setback when he is taken into hospital with a suspected lung infection, but he is soon well enough again to go back to his old ways, taking advantage of Lily, the wife of a fellow-patient. Among his other victims are unhappily-married Carla, home-loving Northerner Annie, and wealthy older woman Ruby."Halliwell's Film Guide" describes the film as a "garish sex comedy", which strikes me as a misconception. Despite a certain superficial similarity in plot to the likes of "Confessions of a Window Cleaner", the film is actually a deeply serious one. Certainly, Alfie himself is a bit of a comedian who sees life as one big joke, always endeavouring to look on the bright side. Cheerfulness can in some cases be an admirable attribute, but in Alfie's case it goes hand-in-hand with a crass insensitivity to the problems and emotions of others. What he wants out of life is commitment-free relationships which will enable him to find sexual satisfaction with as many women as possible. Perhaps the most telling detail about his character is that he habitually refers to women as "it" rather than "she".Only at the end of the film does it start to dawn on him that there might be more to life than a series of one-night stands, and he starts to ponder the question "What's it all about?" (The question is enshrined in the famous song which we hear at the end of the film as Alfie stands by the Thames pondering his future). There are three key moments in Alfie's gradual enlightenment. One comes when he wanders into a church where Gilda and Humphrey are having their first child baptised, and he realises that he is missing out on family life. Another comes when he discovers that Ruby has dumped him in favour of an even younger toyboy. For the first time he is being used in the way he uses others, and he doesn't like it. The most moving comes when, after Alfie has bullied Lily, whom he has got pregnant, into having an illegal abortion, he is shocked by the sight of his dead unborn child.Caine gives one of his best performances as the cheerfully immoral hero, and he receives good support from a number of others, especially Vivien Merchant as the tragic Lily, Alfie Bass as her invalid husband Harry and Denholm Elliott as the cynical abortionist.The film is firmly rooted in the working-class London of the mid-sixties, and reflects the Zeitgeist of that period. It was a time when the Pill was a recent invention, when the sexual revolution was just beginning but when older, conservative, attitudes towards sex were stronger than they are today. Although Alfie's conquests are played by some of the best-looking British actresses of the period, such as Shirley Anne Field, Julia Foster and Jane Asher, they are not mini-skirted dolly-birds, but basically old-fashioned girls, conservatively, even dowdily, dressed. All of them, except the sluttish Ruby, are looking for love rather than sex, and he is smart enough to know this and cynical enough to exploit it.In some respects the film was a progressive one for its period, both in its stylistic devices, such as having the hero speak direct to camera, and in its frankness about sexual matters, especially the highly controversial topic of abortion (still illegal in Britain in 1966, although it was to be legalised the following year). In its view of social matters, however, it is more conservative; its attitude towards abortion, for example, is more pro-life than pro-choice. The film can perhaps be seen as a critique of the sexual revolution, showing how greater sexual freedom was giving irresponsible philanderers like Alfie more opportunities to seduce women. The irony is that Alfie ends up ruining his own life as effectively as he has ruined theirs. Beneath its permissive surface, "Alfie" is a devastating exposure of the dark side of the sexual revolution. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes the Swing Out of Swinging London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine plays Alfie, a hipster swinger in 1960s London whose attitudes and actions we abhor even as we warm to the twinkle in his eye.Caine plays the role just right. The movie would go nowhere if he wasn't able to make us understand what about Alfie attracts women despite his treatment of them. The film has noble ambitions, and explores some pretty dark (and for the time, edgy) terrain, when Alfie's antics catch up with him and he leaves one of his conquests (played quietly by Vivien Merchant) in the hands of a sleazy abortionist. The look on Caine's face when he returns to his apartment and sees the aborted fetus, visual confirmation of his callous disregard, was enough on its own to earn him the Oscar nomination he received for this film.Much of the marketing for "Alfie" positions it as a gay romp through the swinging 60s, but it's actually quite a bitter little pill to swallow, and it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.With Shelley Winters as a blowsy American who's as good at playing Alfie as he is her.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unexamined Life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superb film. Michael Caine is Alfie, a working-class Londoner who weaves his way in and out of episodes with various birds, referred to using the neutral "it," as in "it's all in love and ghosty now," and the consequences grow more dramatic.Alfie waltzes through all these sequential affairs with aplomb. Nothing bothers him. He's on the hedonic treadmill. He interrupts the goings on from time to time in order to deliver a wisecrack to the camera or sometimes a soliloquy with philosophical content such as "a man and a woman talking' about things is intimate. You know what? Sometimes I think it's more intimate than the other." Those consequences, though, rather accumulate and begin to distress him. Not for very long. He's incapable of being genuinely depressed, taking advantage, as he does, of Kierkegaard's unfolding moment. What I mean is -- the guy is pretty shallow.His first problem comes when one of his girl friends gets pregnant. Quite an inconvenience when she insists on having the baby. She names the boy Malcolm Alfred and Alfie manages to stick around, without marrying her, for two years or so. The woman, Gilda, saddled with a child, an irresponsible lover and financial expenses, marries someone she doesn't love but whom she respects. Good-bye Gilda and little Malcom.Not that it bothers Alfie naturally. There is a crisis, though, when he's called back to the doctor's office after a chest X-ray. Oh, he's carrying on, flirting with the nurse, winking at the camera, telling us how he's not doing anything any other bloke wouldn't do, when the nurse interrupts him to tell him he has two "shadows" on his lungs. This doesn't penetrate his denticles either. He scoffs that there's something wrong with the "picture." And then he glances out the window and glimpses a funeral across the street. "SHADOWS! Oh, me God! I'm being eaten up inside!" And he faints. You see, he has to be hit over the head with representations of the future before he can grasp what's going on.There isn't space to go into this. Another ex girl friend shows up three months pregnant and Alfie arranges for an illegal abortion. ("Well, it was the least I could do.") The woman pays the abortionist. And the end result is a tiny well-formed fetus which causes Alfie to cry and run away. ("When it comes to women's troubles, I don't know and I don't want to know.") He tells an acquaintance that the sight of the dead fetus made him feel sorry, a queer emotion for him. "Sorry for the baby?" "No -- he was past it. Sorry for myself." He never does fully grow up. This is a movie for adults and in real life superficial people don't undergo epiphanies. "I just don't have me peace of mind." That's the best he can do.Nobody could do a better job in this role than Michael Caine. He's an extraordinarily likable actor, for one thing. For another he has respectable range. His native working-class accent here contrasts with his upper-class put-on accent in "Zulu." And the other performances could hardly be improved upon.The script is extremely effective. Alfie's asides to the camera in no way interrupt the flow of events we witness on screen. The speech of people of Alfie's class is captured precisely. Alfie is given no easy excuse for his careless attitudes towards the feelings of others. "I don't mean to hurt people, really I don't" he tells a friend. "Ah, but you do, Alfie, you do." (He's boffing the guy's wife.) He wasn't abused as a child. He isn't haunted by a tragic love affair. The women Alfie picks up are no more and no less attractive or sexy than those one might meet in a supermarket. Here, I must register a complaint. I don't know why it's so easy for Alfie to pick up his birds, so much more difficult than it was for me. He just looks like Michael Caine, whereas I looked like a reincarnation of Cary Grant. Well -- the perfect film is not yet with us. I attribute his success to pheromones.Nice, appropriate score too. (Sonny Rollins.)You know something, love? You really ought to watch this if you have a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's it all about, Alfie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfie, the movie which launched Michael Caine's career, is a drama (perhaps dark comedy, although I would not label it as a pure comedy) about the ways of a playboy constantly having affairs with both women - married ones, too! He's a pretty bad character - making the women feel miserable, ordering them around, impregnating them left right and center... yep, a pretty detestable character! But what is great about this movie is that you see Alfie's character change throughout.. when he sees the fetus, when he catches her with another guy, she tells him that "he's younger than you are" and many others. The plot is easy as Michael Caine is the narrator, too (great technique!!).Great acting, great movie. Funny, touching and meaningful, I recommend it to you.</fullReview>

Jane Asher was amazing as the sweet, sad and naive Annie. I just can't imagine anyone but Shirley Winters in the role of the older American woman. I admire the casting directors for putting Jane, Shirley, Eleanor and so forth in the roles of the ladies in Alfie's life.I like the use of the scruffy dog at the start and end of the film.

		<shortDescription>Wow...was I mistaken about this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very glad I finally got around to seeing "Alfie". For years I incorrectly assumed two things--that it was a smutty little film and that it was a comedy. While the film does have a very strong message about sex and the title character seems to be sexually addicted, it is far, far deeper. And, while the film appears to be a comedy, as the film progresses it becomes more and more serious. All in all, I was very impressed by this film--it had far more depth than I'd assumed.The film begins with Alfie (Michael Caine) making it with a married lady in a car. You don't see any of it but hear them as he tries to convince her to go all the way. Now here is where it gets weird--Alfie gets out of the car and then begins addressing the audience. In fact, throughout the film he stops to talk to the audience--to discuss his philosophy about women, marriage and relationships. Now MOST of what he says is pure drivel--a guy coming up with 1001 reasons why it was okay to use women and why emotionally connecting with any of them was a BIG mistake. However, as the story unfolds, Alfie discovers that staying that emotionally distant is very difficult. I could easily say more--but don't want to give away the plot twists.I really loved this film. Michael Caine was at his best as a lovable but emotionally stunted rogue. But what really impressed me was the writing. This film would be WONDERFUL to show to young men--especially since there are so many 'Alfies' out there and seeing how lonely this sort of life could be is a great lesson for young folks. See this film--it's so much more than I'd expected and had amazing depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's it all about, Alfie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Alfie" is the film that made Michael Caine a star some 44 years ago. Here he plays a working-class lothario whose relationships with women are typified by selfishness and a lack of scruples.Being a film from the swinging sixties I half-expected a badly dated affair. Luckily, that expectation proved to be unfounded, though there seem to be quite a few who hold that opinion. As I see it, Alfie finds a ready counterpart in the self-styled 'player' of today.Michael Caine pulls off the difficult title role with ease. Alfie is a fairly loathsome character but his candour makes him appealing as a sort of anti-hero. The various women that cross his path are all convincingly portrayed, including Academy Award nominee Vivien Merchant.The film's presentation is attractive and Lewis Gilbert's direction handles Alfie's many asides with fluidity. The score by jazzman Sonny Rollins is a nice change of pace as well. And, of course, let's not forget the Oscar-nominated theme song by Burt Bacharach &amp; Hal David.In my opinion, the one thing that drags the film down slightly is that the plot seems a bit aimless for much of the film. This isn't particularly surprising since the film is really more of a character study. As far as that goes, it's a rewarding viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent picture, great comedy, outstanding performance and out of the world great music which can be appreciated from generation to generation. Michael Caine, (Alfie Elkins) "Dessed to Kill" played the role of a love'm and leave'm sort of a playboy and a rather hateful and likable guy despite all his faults. Shelly Winters, (Ruby) plays the role of a rich older gal with a nice full figure who manages to capture Alfie's attention and draws him back to her time and again to her flat in London. This film shows that their is a Price Tag everyone has to pay for their decisions in life and taking the life of a human being will leave a scar on your soul you will never get rid of. Enjoyable, but rather sad film which has a deep moral story to tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanted: Alfie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wanting to see Jude Law in "Alfie", I asked my dad to buy the DVD. Wrong move. Being the father that he is, he got the Michael Caine version. I left the DVD untouched for months until I finally plucked the courage to give it a go.I was glued to my seat (well, bed) throughout the entire movie. Never did I expect to be so into a movie with an actor I was almost unfamiliar with (aside from seeing him as a butler in "Batman Begins").Caine had me mesmerized with his portrayal of Alfie, a carefree, happy-go-lucky bloke who knows how to deal with women, and GETS the women. His witty remarks to the camera and his side comments are hilarious, yet endearing. Wannabe-playboys could learn a thing or two (or three or a million) from this movie.Although I have not seen the remake with Jude Law, I can safely say that Michael Caine has done his job well and it would be most definitely hard to try to live up to his portrayal of Alfie. It's no wonder why he had women swooning at his feet. I know I would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched the first 10 minutes of this film, I was initially pretty shocked by the unveiled misogynism of Alfie - he is an incredible dislikeable character and his success with women is baffling to the modern viewer. However, Michael Caine manages to make you care about awful Alfie and consequently the film is extremely likable. I also love Caine's hilarious accent (sorry to all those who share it) and the way he breaks the scene to talk to the camera. This film is really well made and has a lot of charm. Shelley Winters (who played Lolita's mother) is also fantastic as the American woman who finally breaks Alfie's heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having gotten a lead role in "The Ipcress File", Michael Caine got the role with which I believe that he remains best associated: ladies' man Alfie Elkins. Alfie traipses around London, having flings with various and sundry "birds", to the point where he starts seeming like a sexist pig - although it's probably debatable whether he is one. One might say that he loves every one of these women, or that he's just doing this for fun, but either way, it just may all come crashing down on him.On one level, "Alfie" is also a look at Swinging London. There's the ubiquitous clothes and hairstyles, among other things. As for Caine's female co-stars, there's Shelley Winters, Millicent Martin, Julia Foster, Jane Asher, Shirley Anne Field, and Vivien Merchant, to name a few. Lewis Gilbert directed two other really good women-related movies: "Educating Rita" (also starring Caine) and "Shirley Valentine".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent, pretty frank and even-handed look at the life of a mid-1960s womanizing single man. The story and acting are excellent, utterly convincing, and interesting.Alfie's character is very well-developed and portrayed; rather than being a single-dimensional icon or stock generalization, he is complex. Alfie is sympathetic and unsympathetic at the same time. He is a chauvinist who cares little for the people (primarily women) in his relationships, avoids emotional attachments or long-term relationships with women who seem to want them, lives in the moment for himself, uses women, has them cook for him, etc. Yet at the same time he also shows some consideration for them and at least appears to want them to do what they want, be free, etc. He in some ways wants (or at least truly thinks that he wants) the women to live by the same rules he does. He also clearly never has any intention to hurt people, which he also states quite clearly. However, he clearly does not think about how his actions do hurt people and he is too focused on himself, while he may at first think that he wants the women to be as "free" as he, but in reality he doesn't as he realizes only too late how hurtful it is when women treat him the way he has treated them. This dichotomy in his character is handled with great subtlety and care, and the way he comes to realize how hurtful it is to be in a relation with someone like him is perfect. It is also developed excellently with his first-hand look at how his actions hurt women whom he professed never to want to hurt, when he sees the pain that he admits he never wanted to know about. Meanwhile, throughout the movie he is slowly (very slowly at first) beginning to realize what he is missing by shutting the women out and cutting his ties with them when they get too close. The final scenes of the film where each of these realization hits home one after the other is handled perfectly.The film is also an excellent look at the time, on the cusp of radical social change with respect to gender and sexuality and the specifics of the story appear utterly out of place and unconvincing in the modern remake. There is, moreover, no real point in remaking such an excellently executed classic as this.Finally, I want to add that, although the comparison never seems to be made, I find this film to be somewhat similar to La Dolce Vita in some of the overall themes (pointlessness, pain, etc., of superficial relationships and living solely in the moment), yet this film is handled far better. Obviously, the films are not entirely on the same points, with La Dolce Vita dealing with other elements as well and in a different country, etc., but some of these basic points are very close, and the approaches are also very similar: showing the stream of changing, empty relationships and the failure to grasp at the chances for a full, meaningful relationship, that in the end ultimately leave the character without any meaningful life or direction, lost and lonely. I also find Alfie to be more gripping and watchable as La Dolce Vita, for all its strengths, sags pretty badly in the middle and never really quite hits things on the head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie again; it's been a while. I was so pleased to see that it's even better than I remember. In fact, I'd call this movie flawless. Michael Caine was perfect as Alfie; I can't imagine this movie with any actor other than him.Alfie is a using womanizer (he refers to women as "birds" and "its"), and we see through one relationship after another how this lifestyle is poisonous to him.Even when he's at his most caddish at the beginning of the film, we see sparks of the decent fellow lurking underneath the character's facade. That decent fellow pops up more and more throughout the film (though almost always overshadowed by Alfie the cad), until at the end you finally have hope that Alfie might "get it" and find true happiness in life. The brutally honest abortion scene seems to be the turning point for Alfie, and the words he utters to his friend after the deed regarding the tiny baby that was eliminated via the abortion will probably shock modern audiences in its frankness. I can't imagine any movie character in 2005 talking about abortion the way Alfie did.I loved Alfie's addressing the camera directly. Nowadays that technique is pretty "been there, done that" but I'm guessing for 1966 it was fairly new. At any rate, it worked really well. Michael Caine was sheer perfection in transitioning between action in the movie to talking to the audience to going back to the action in the flick.I loved Caine's Cockney accent and his horrible, slangy English. A couple of fer'instances: the word "mumsy" which he used as an adjective to describe a woman's maternal feelings; the word "lustbox" which he used to describe Shelly Winters's character who had a voracious sexual appetite.Great acting, great dialogue, a story that's funny and tragic all at the same time, and a lead character who's a selfish bastard and lovable all at the same time. I think this 1966 flick will always be timely and have something to say to the audience, regardless of the decade or century it's said in.</fullReview>

Personally I feel that Alfie is Micheal Caine's best performance - His arrogance and confidence, as well as his indifference to emotion are still very powerful. His gradual realisation of his own mortality, his diminishing self confidence and the fact he has nothing but memories turn the story full circle. His monologues to camera are simply staggering, and are still some of the finest pieces of acting I have ever seen. I still feel few films have explored to a similar or greater degree- human nature and how people really live their lives. This film isn't like the Hollywood drivel of the time - The lead is a misogynist who tells you what he thinks! This film is in my top 5 ever - its simply that good. Paul R</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The technique of having Caine speak directly to the camera is what makes the film. Alfie is so open and frank with the audience that we share his experiences. If the film were shown in a conventional third person style we would obviously dislike Alfie. He takes us in with his charm just as he imposes his will on the "birds" he manipulates. In a sense the audience has become another of Alfie's birds. I was struck by a similar style in the more recent High Fidelity. Cusack speaking directly to the camera reminded me of Alfie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caine at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film, and offers Michael Caine at his best as an ageing, bed-hopping cockney. While he seems a little typecast, as usual (there are some moments where you think Jack Carter is going to surface in his less pleasant moments), Caine really engages his audience with soliloquy-style monologues into the camera, providing a refreshingly honest narration.In spite of a somewhat grey, interchangeable supporting cast, the film shows a dirtier, less glamourous side to London's 'swinging' sixties and in my mind, Alfie is a far more engaging, if less polished antihero than Sebastian Valmont (Cruel Intentions), the film I would most compare it with for content.This is a great film, in spite of its dated look and style, and you can't help but be drawn into Alfie's emotional rollercoaster as he falls on his luck and, some might say, get what's coming to him. They don't make them like this any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie for grownups</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine gets well-deserved praise for his acting, but I'd like to give credit to Bill Naughton, the man who wrote the play on which the movie is based and who wrote the screenplay. Naughton's understanding of Alfie is deep and caring, even though Alfie is a narcissistic jerk. Caine gets the character right, showing us all Alfie's flaws without making the character unbearable.Alfie is a man whose goal in life is to screw women. His references to women in general, and each particular woman he dates, is to "bird" and "it." "It's a nice little bird, isn't it?" he'll ask us -- Alfie looks straight at the camera and addresses us the viewers as his co-conspirators in life. If you didn't see Michael Caine in the 60s when he was in his prime, you may be surprised at his good looks; he was almost pretty. It makes it totally credible that Caine's Alfie could be a ladies man and get quite beautiful women to stay with him in spite of his narcissism and lack of any caring at all. Alfie's asides to the camera are plentiful and revealing of his character. We're taken into his confidence, even as the women are taken.The film is very 60s in its view of things. Sex outside of marriage was a sin, nice girls didn't do it, and girls who did were looked down upon. And Alfie is a cad who preys upon nice girls. Among his victims are Annie, played by Jane Asher. (Asher was an actress from her pre- school days, but she may be best known as Paul McArtney's long-time girlfriend. She's said to be the inspiration for the songs "And I Love Her," "All my Loving," "Here, There and Everywhere," among others.) There's also the sad Lily, wife of a long-term patient in a nursing home who is an acquaintance of Alfie's. Lily is very well played by Vivien Merchant. (Merchant had some sad times of her own, I understand. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this role, and she was in many other plays and movies. Married to Harold Pinter, he cheated on her, setting up his script for "Betrayal." After the divorce, Merchant died from the consequences of her alcoholism at the age of 53.) Shelley Winters plays Ruby, the character Alfie likes most of his birds. But she's too much like him for it to work."Alfie" can be seen as comedic, but the underlying themes are depressing. Naughton uses humor to make an otherwise unrelentingly inhuman and inhumane point of view -- well, not likable, but at least bearable. The script is very impressive as Naughton (and Caine) peel away Alfie's layers of defenses, baring his sorry excuse for a soul. When we finally get to Alfie's heart, there's nothing there.The music is excellent; original music is by Sonny Rollins. He did a great job of capturing the spirit of the 60s and the spirit of Alfie. Cinematographer Otto Heller and director Lewis Gilbert made great use of the sets and the camera, capturing Alfie in his milieu. "Alfie" received 5 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and Best Screenplay based on Material from another Medium.If you liked Caine in this, I suggest seeing "The Ipcress File," which came out a year earlier.I saw Shelley Winters being interviewed on TV about this movie. She said she couldn't understand a word Michael Caine said and that the movie was re-dubbed for American audiences to soften Alfie's cockney accent. At least that's my recollection, and I'm sticking with it.I haven't seen the later version with Jude Law. My impression is that the two versions cannot be compared. Don't let your like or dislike of the later version sway you in seeing the 1966 "Alfie."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly fresh and brilliant, and filled with moral disruption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfie (1966)There are two ways to love this movie. One is the way people in 1966 did, with a certain amount of shock at the candor and callousness of the main character, and how the dealt with pregnancy and abortion. The other is how it is made, which was impressive at the time and equally so now--even more so, considering how it has aged so well. I truly "tells" a story, and Michael Caine is brilliant, subtle, chilling, and believable in the starring role of Alfie.On the first score, there is something unsettling, really really funny, and daring about the subject--a true cad, a British young man who has his way with women but only, it seems, in the most superficial way, emotionally. You want to hate him for it, but he's so likable, and so honest, and fresh, and frankly charming to the gills, you can't help but have mixed feelings. Caine defines the role so thoroughly, in the remake, you feel Jude Law trying not to be Alfie, but be Michael Caine (and it doesn't work nearly as well).On the second, the way the movie was made, with many long takes, and with the main character (and no one else) narrating directly into the camera, but often in the middle of real action, is uncanny and virtuosic. Everyone involved had to have been sharp as a tack to get this right, the timing and feel, the light and the deadpan acting (I saw a crack of a smile during the long clinic scene). It makes for a dry approach, in a way, and it forces detachment from the plot proper. But it draws you into Alfie's plight, and flight, and complicated character. There are other movies made in the mid 1960s that are about the early and mid 1960s in working class London without trying to be, but this is among the best, like "Easy Rider" is clearly about the later 1960s in America. The new mores of the fresh sexual revolution are just being sorted out by cast and character and audience, almost before our eyes as we watch. It's quite remarkable, really. There's a lot of talk, and if you don't get into that pace right away you'll be doomed. But if you connect, and see the brilliance of it, you'll be blown away. Singular and special.Notice also the terrific music by Sonny Rollins, and of course the famous title song, sung by Cher. And though Michael Caine steals the show, the rest of the cast is spot on serious and authentic. Oddly, this is roughly the same time as the recent "An Education" and it has a little echo in some ways. But oh how much more true "Alfie" is from top to bottom. This may be fiction, but it gets to what matters very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Michael Caine's launching pad movies, Alfie is a cunning observation of the hedonistic swinging 60s, of a mod London that time has left behind. Adapted by Bill Naughton from his own play, it's directed by Lewis Gilbert and sees Caine supported by Shelley Winters, Millicent Martin, Julia Foster, Jane Asher, Shirley Anne Field and Vivien Merchant.Undeniably dated and arguably pushing the boundaries of the war between the sexes, it's a picture that is often wry and bittersweet and yet also so sad. It never shies away from responsibility, deftly showing the pitfalls of the era, with Caine absolutely marvellous as Alfie goes through his armoury of sexual charm and bizarre naivety.The viewing of sex and adultery, from both sides of the coin, is frank and telling, with the smartness of the production garnering 5 Oscar nominations. Come the end of the play, you will have feelings you didn't think were coming your way. Especially after a turn of events that is harrowing and potent in equal measure.Of its time for sure, but relevant film making? Without a doubt. Exceptionally performed in to the bargain. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More swinging '60s London, this time with unrepentant *beep* Michael Caine at the center. Alfie is a shameless philanderer, sleeping with multiple women, some of them married, and narrating his exploits to the audience in asides, referring to the various women as "it"s. Quite a disgusting and unlikable character to center a movie around! Yes, he softens a bit towards the end (a bit), but it's quite hard to not just spend most of the movie despising him. It is, however, a good movie in most ways, and Caine is, unsurprisingly, excellent. The film was popular enough that it received a Best Picture nomination, and Caine received his first Best Actor nomination. Seeing as Shelly Winters is second billed as one of Alfie's more unconventional lovers, I'm shocked that the Academy looked past her (whom the Academy seemed to nominate every time she farted her way into a movie like she does here) and nominated Vivien Merchant for Best Supporting Actress. She plays one of Alfie's married lovers, the one who is forced to go through with an abortion during the film's climax. I'm sure the traumatic event is what got her the nom, because she's honestly unmemorable. Millicent Martin and Jane Asher both give better supporting performances than either Winter or Merchant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfie is very much a film of it's time, it's purpose to be a critique of the swinging 60's lifestyle. Why it was remade I do not know.Michael Caine plays Alfie, the hedonistic, sexist, hypercritical, narcissistic cockney who breaks the fourth wall letting us into his thoughts and feelings. Caine is great in the role showing the ability that would make him a household name in years to come.Lewis Gilbert's direction is extremely detailed and symbolic as meaning can be found everywhere, mainly to symbolise Alfie's inner conflict as well as the real Britain in the 60's as opposed to the media's representation of "Swinging Britain".This Kitchen Sink film stands out for its use of 4th wall breaking. Although criticised, Alfie has become infamous for his ability to break the fourth wall. This allows the audience to react to him rather differently (sort of positively) as he allows us into his life and mind.The film deals with some rather interesting issues that were deemed controversial at the time and still are today. The issues of abortion, gender equality, homosexuality, divorce etc are all at least touched on in this film. The abortion scene in Alfie (Where Alfie goes behind the blue curtain) is in my opinion the best scene in the film, as even watching it now I was shocked and to think how people would have reacted in the 60's I can only imagine. Also in the scene Alfie finally lets out a cry bringing his feelings to the surface which is the best acting Michael Caine's puts on display in the film.Alfie is a classic film, a film of its time that can be looked back at as a part of cinematic and British history of the 60's. It's a good film I just simply have no idea why this would be remade, being a film that is set, made and about the 60's. But that's a review for another day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfie Elkins (Michael Caine) is an irresponsible womanizer. He gets Gilda pregnant but even the birth of his son can't straighten him out. He complains constantly. Gilda decides to marry a bus driver for stability and keeps her son from Alfie. A health checkup finds two shadows on his lungs. He breaks down and spends time in a recovery home. He sleeps with the nurses and befriends his neighbor Harry who misses terribly his wife Lily. Harry sleeps with Lily getting her pregnant and is horrified by the abortion. He continues with various women but he wonders "What's it all about? You know what I mean." This takes London's swinging 60s to a darker place. It's not free love. In fact, Alfie is selfish and the women are often left in the dust. Breaking down the 4th wall is important because it allows the audience into Alfie's mind. He's not mean-spirited but he is self-obsessed. He excuses his antics with no malice. This is one of Michael Caine's great early performances. The abortion scene is shocking and there's no way modern mainstream movies would ever do that today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only a handful of movies left a warm feeling on me after viewing, such as The Pianist, Forrest Gump and 500 Days of Summer; and I'm glad to include Alfie as one of those movies that left the same impression on me. Alfie is a British comedy drama released in 1966 with the main star Michael Caine as the titular playboy who has a libertine philosophy and readily disposes any woman he meets as just another 'bird'. The plot revolves around Alfie's relationship with these women and the consequences of each and each relationship have a character of their own as Alfie manipulates the girls to satiate himself, and to cower away from responsibilities. Essentially, the story is Alfie's adventures and shenanigans with laugh out loud jokes and innuendos.The film Alfie is a stunningly beautiful and well crafted film with a narrative characteristic of other good contemporary films at that time (such as The Godfather)- subtle and lets the audience read the situation for themselves. This type of narrative was used effectively in the movie especially in some scenes bringing a very edgy and powerful emotion for the audience and this is very true near the end of the movie which I wouldn't spoil. Another aspect special in the narrative is breaking the fourth wall. Alfie talks to the audience directly for hilarious effect. The cinematography is also excellent that complements well with the script and so every scene in the movie feels like they have their own life. Every place seen in the movie feels unique from the countryside, the apartment, the convalescent home, the pier everything has been filmed beautifully.In relations to acting, I have not seen the 2004 remake with Jude Law to compare with bur Michael Caine is absolutely excellent and he, only him, could play the role of Alfie and no one else. Michael Caine's English accent coupled with the English charm gives an impeccable performance making Alfie as a character very unique. The other casts as well have given excellent performance on the same level of Caine. Julie Foster as the timid and clingy Gilda, Vivien Merchant as the Lilly who is a shy and submissive wife of Alfie's friend Harry and Shelley Winters who plays as Ruby, the promiscuous American female counterpart of Alfie. The actresses have given excellent performances and like the character of Alfie, the female characters that the women have unique and interesting personalities that interact with Alfie. Personalities that fit to Alfie's As previously mentioned, the story is essentially Alfie's adventures and shenanigans but beneath the layer is Alfie's own personal development. As the story progresses, it becomes more and more mature and dark leading to the infamous gut-wrenching scene which I wouldn't spoil to some but to note, the scene I refer to is intricately crafted as we see a close-up look of Alfie's face turn from curiosity to disgust. That scene punched right in to the gut and left me speechless. At the end, Alfie's closing monologue have made him, and us, ponder about life when he asked us: What is it all about? Indeed what is it all about? His closing monologue certainly rings true but sad as Alfie outlines the advantage of being a care-free playboy but at the same time, miserable for being incapable to commit. The thought-provoking ending makes you and I think of the nature of life but specifically relationships, similar to the movie Annie Hall by Woody Allen. In the end, what is it all about?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly dated but engaging dramedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ALFIE is a somewhat dated, but still engaging dramedy, with a star-making performance by Michael Caine. The film is about Alfie, a Cockney ladies' man with commitment issues, and the audience is personally led through his life by him breaking the fourth wall and addressing us directly. This is useful on a couple of levels. First, it is amusing that he can do that without his female companions being any wiser, but it also allows the viewer to connect with him in a much deeper way. As Alfie is a rather unlikeable character, save for a couple scenes where he shows some genuine emotion, the way in which he directly communicates with the audience is key in laying bare the character's motivation, regardless of whether or not you agree with what he does. Early on in the film, there is a sly comedic tone set which carries throughout most of the running time, until it takes a turn for the melodramatic. I didn't particularly like the direction it went, but it did serve a narrative and character-building purpose. I also felt like Alfie's comeuppance was handled rather well. Overall, this was a good movie, though occasionally slightly tedious. Michael Caine's performance is the real draw here. Still, there was a nice soundtrack and closing credits song by Cher. Despite some rather dated morals, I felt that this was a good character study of someone who knows how to make love, but doesn't know how to love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfie is one of Michael Caine's first starring roles and one of the films that really broke him into Hollywood's finest. It tells the story of a womanizer who does everything for himself and nothing for others. He doesn't really love anything besides women in general, as he constantly breaks the fourth wall and tells the audience. He lives a care free life that seems to be unbreakable, that is until some of his not-so-smart actions come back to bite him.If there's ever a movie that reassures me that true love is the only way you will never feel lonely in this world, it's this one. Alfie spends years cheating on every woman he's with, even having a child along the way. He never gives the audience true emotion until his mistakes of the past present new problems for his future. It is then and only then that we as the audience feel any sympathy towards the character. I think the film lacks the depth behind his character enough for the audience to truly care and root for him. He is quite often obnoxious and treats women as objects rather than beautiful human beings.Michael Caine gives a brilliant performance that catapulted his career to new levels and even earned him an Oscar nomination. But even his charm couldn't get me to love this movie. It's an enjoyable film that at times can be a bit uncomfortable but Caine makes it watchable.+Caine's breakthrough role +Ending song +4th wall breaking -Unlikable and uncomfortable characters -Lacks emotion 7.5/10</fullReview>

An amoral hedonists series of amorous adventures lead to him realising he is lonely.Best Performance: Michael Caine Worst Performance: Jane Asher</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how to do a character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine plays Alfie who is a bed hopping care free Jack the Lad. Alfie basically sees women as tools for his pleasure and they are merely objects that are there to bolster his ego. However, when one of his conquests Gilda (Julia Foster) ends up pregnant and subsequently decides that she's keeping the baby, Alfie finds that, for once, he has some responsibility in his life (which he isn't pleased about). However, the addition of a child in his life doesn't faze him and he continues with his philandering ways ultimately to his own detriment.What I really enjoy about these 'character study' type films is that when they're done right they provide so much thought for the viewer. Michael Caine narrates the films partly in person (in front of the camera) and partly through voice-over. Many films use this approach in order to help viewers to get an understanding of its characters and Alfie is no different. It's quite clear that Alfie likes to be in control - he chooses when to visit his conquests and he also never really gets too close to his conquests and tries not to get emotionally involved with any of them. A possible reason for this is that he probably feels that if he gets too attached to any single woman that he may lose control and will leave himself open to being hurt. There is a scene where Alfie is in hospital and he makes an assumption that one patient's wife is having an affair with another man because she's late visiting her husband - he has no evidence that this occurs and I believe that he makes this assumption based on the fact that he cheats on a lot of husband's wives so therefore they must be doing it to their husbands. In a twist of irony, Alfie does end up having an affair with the very women who he accused of cheating on her husband.I suspect that the premise of this film may have put some people off (particularly women) as on the surface it is about a bed hopping womaniser. It also has an abortion scene later in the film which may upset some people (depending upon what your views are on this subject). However, if you look beyond the obvious this is actually an excellent character study and as we witness Alfie losing everything and everyone it highlights the downside of promiscuity. The mother of his child marries Humphrey who is basically everything that Alfie isn't (loving, loyal, caring). The one women that he actually falls for ends up cheating on him with a much younger man - I think this was the key scene in the film as it finally brought everything home to Alfie and meant that for once in his life he wasn't in control of a relationship which was the one thing that he never thought would happen and therefore, in effect, the 'player' had been 'played'. When you think about it at the start of the film he was 'alone' and at the end of the film he ends up 'alone' - although he's learnt a lot of life lessons between A and B.Michael Caine was superb in the lead role of Alfie and due to the fact that this film acts as a character study it's down to Michael Caine to carry the film which he does with ease. Caine is always watchable, but this is probably the best I've ever seen from him. The supporting cast are all good too, but this really is the Michael Caine show.The only very minor criticism I have with this film was with the bar fight scene which just went on for far too long and seemed out of place in a character studying drama - it would have been fine in a Western, but in a serious drama it just cheapened the film a little bit (although I'll admit it was quite fun to watch).Alfie is a wonderful film and is also an excellent character study (probably one of the best I've seen). The film acts as a cautionary tale more than anything else. Alfie is film making at its absolute best. Superb!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny and intriguing movie, yet at the same time often irritating and cringeworthy.Alfie's character was an interesting one. Certainly not a nice one, but interesting, in the sense of "Do/did such jerks/misogynists exist?". Maybe his character was too extreme - surely nobody is so insensitive and self-absorbed.Quite funny at times, though this sometimes was a two-edged sword as you're laughing at some quite obnoxious behaviour. As long as you're laughing at him, not with him, I guess.Great performance from Michael Caine in the lead role. Might be the only time in his life he has played a villain.Supporting cast is great too, especially Shelley Winters, Millicent Martin, Vivien Merchant and Jane Asher. Jane Asher is incredibly beautiful in this movie. Controversial, and probably very un-PC nowadays, yet it works. Alfie's behaviour is not glorified and he has his comeuppance at the end.</fullReview>

Film does take a serious turn, though the change of tone is welcome and works, because, by the end, you realize that beneath it all, Alfie is kind of a sad person, whose casual treatment of women will not serve him well as he gets older...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was interesting to learn that Alfie had its origins on stage with a play because the way it was brought to the screen clearly showed author Bill Naughton's bow to Eugene O'Neill's influence. The play and film are about cheerful hedonist Alfie Elkins who wants nothing more in life than to kanoodle with as many women as he can. As apparently he does not believe in condoms that creates several problems for him, a couple of which would never have occurred with use of same.Michael Caine plays Alfie endearing cockney charm and all and as he goes through various sexual entanglements all in the spirit of fun and pulls aside as in Strange Interlude and talks about the 'birds' and his philosophy of life which changes as he changes as the film progresses. Caine creates a memorable character worthy of the Best Actor nomination he got.The women are pretty memorable as well. Jane Asher plays a runaway who Caine steals from a truckdriver who picked her up. Shelley Winters is as cheerful a hedonist as Caine is and a bit more experienced. Winters put down of him is devastating.Most memorable is Vivien Merchant who got a Best Supporting Actress nomination playing the wife of a fellow patient of Caine's while Caine is in a hospital for a short stay. He seduces Merchant, the mother of three and gives her a fourth. The guilt for this indiscretion that Merchant bears brought her that nomination.Also in that hospital is Dr. Eleanor Bron who is the only woman seemingly immune to Michael Caine's charms. Perhaps because she looks at him from a clinical perspective only.Alfie also got nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Song for the 60s classic What's It All About Alfie. Bill Naughton also got a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Naughton also did another fine film from that decade, The Family Way. I recommend you see both.</fullReview>

Caine appears to have approached this role with a lot of confidence ...and why not, he already had a cockney accent...and he was also very cocky. His performance is 95% of the reasons why this is a very good movie. He gives one of the truly GREAT screen performances. The film is not just a comedy...there are examinations of deep and complex social issues...and there are lots of windows into the swinging sixties. But in the final analysis this is Michael Caines movie....for it is his character that stays with us, long after we are mesmerized by his bravado performance. He is still working today...at the age of 79. He has given some great performances over the years...but none to equal his work as Alfie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what it's all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfie is a pretty amazing movie for it's time. Helmed by a brilliant performance by Michael Caine, Alfie is about several things if you think about it.Essentially, it's all about one man's exploits in London during the swinging 60's. Sheesh, if you want a photographic example of the mod set in the 1960's. look no further. Mind you, I'm not saying that everyone ACTED like Alfie during the 1960's (I hope not!) but, look at the fashions and slang! On top of all that, you have Michael Caine as the central character, and well, you have a textbook example of what made film-making in the 1960's so special.If you look at it, Alfie is a pretty unappetizing character. A total womanizer, someone who almost treats women as objects (he even refers them to them at several points in the film as 'it'), steals women from close friends, and can't be bothered to deal with the consequences of his actions for the most part (eg children). But, like his neighbor, Mr Duddy Kravitz, we love him anyways, because his personality totally wins us over. Seemingly two steps ahead of everyone else and usually out the door before anyone has a clue.But the film is much more than that I feel, I feel it's an examination of what makes men tick, their feelings, their gut reactions. Even though he's a cad, he does have a caring heart from time to time, and in an interesting twist, we find out he is actually human when he's hit by TB and sent out to a sanatorium for a while to cure himself.Once again, Michael Caine is the heart and soul of this movie, he's just so good in it. No wonder people really started paying attention to him after this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure if any movie that has an abortion scene like the one here should be termed a comedy, but whatever the classification if it's got Michael Caine in it you can be assured of a decent performance. I admit I'm on a bit of a Caine roll having watched The Italian Job, Get Carter, Alfie and Batman Begins, but this dude can act. And unlike others who have reputations as great actors (Pacino, Brando), he does it so effortlessly and within the flow of the film. It's never about MICHAEL CAINE THE ACTOR, it's about telling the story. The man just seems so comfortable in front of a camera, which is perfect here since he narrates the entire film into the camera. He's so good here, you almost forgive the strange British timing that prevailed at this time. Perhaps it's just my North American upbringing, but nothing in British films of this time (I would include Antonioni's Blowup) seems paced to please. Scenes seem less punchy, moments drawn out, giving the viewer more time to contemplate, or if you're not the contemplative type, to become impatient. This is not a criticism, just an observation. Another observation is that important characters in these films are introduced later in the films, almost randomly. I suppose this more resembles everyday life, but it makes for less tidy storytelling. In Alfie, for instance, I think the best scenes were between Alfie and Shelly Winters' character, but they are far and few between. Still Caine's performance vastly outweighs any plot shortcomings. I'm not one for superlatives, but this guy is the real deal, know what I mean?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of a Textbook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the era of character creation by flipping through pages in the APA's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual or Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual, I guess I'm surprised that so few reviewers have stumbled onto "what's it all about..." Alfie's got a nice case of "compensatory narcissistic personality disorder." He's a righteous heel. Based on how he acts it out by abusing women who love him, my supposition is that Alfie had a role model. He's probably the son of a father who abused his mother -- and him -- similarly. The pshrinks will tell you his mother failed to protect him from the abusive father, so he's angry at weak women. Moreover, he probably projects himself ("projectively identifies") into the "birds" he abuses: He hates -them- because he hates -himself-.Many narcissists carry on like Alfie for years, decades, maybe even to their deathbeds, the pshrinks say. Most crash into deep depressions every now and again, especially when they can't find more people to abuse to support their addiction to power and control over others to make up for the power and control they didn't have as kiddies.Thus, narcissism of the Alfie style may be about "righteous resentments." Writer Bill Naughton could have picked up his ideas from people Donald Winnicott, Wilfred Bion, Harry Stack Sullivan, Harold Searles, Eric Berne and others who were writing about such topics in the years before the film was made. People like Sam Vaknin, Michael Stone and Theodore Millon write about narcissists nowadays.Does anyone recognize the voice of the singer (and the style of the backup arrangement) doing the theme song over the end credits? The woman really -has- been around since Noah's dog was a pup. Too bad the arranger's moved on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mirror of the 60's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 41 years I got a chance to see this film again and was just bowled over by the glimpse of the way it was in the 60's. The swinging London of Carnaby Street was just beginning, but young singles who did not still live at home with parents were still living in ghastly cheap rooms. I must confess that this film coloured my view of Michael Caine for many, many years. He was always Alfie to me - a selfish, callous self-absorbed cad, which does indicate how good his performance was. The British cinema was getting away from noble heroic types winning WWII with stiff upper lips, who always did their duty and behaved like gentlemen. John Mills, Jack Hawkins, and Kenneth More were giving way to Albert Finney, Kenneth Haig, Alfred Lynch and Michael Caine. The 60's spawned dramas about the working class who subsisted in bad housing and dreary jobs. By the time of the film, national service had ended, if it had not, Alfie would have found a way to get a deferment as he had no loyalty to Queen and country, only to himself.While many current viewers may be shocked and disbelieving of Alfie's attitudes, and the women's acceptance of them, that is exactly how it was with many people of that time. The women were raised to put men first, and the men expected nothing less. Jane Asher, as little Annie from Sheffield was exactly the type of girl that my generation were expected to be. Subservient housekeepers doing the washing, ironing and cooking while their man went out with the boys and had fun. A similar film was Billy Liar, although Billy was a fantasist rather than a cad. I really loved the small background touches in this film. The pub where Queenie Watts continued singing with the band throughout the brawl. The gay man protecting his partner from the brawl (this was before gays "came out"). The awful cheap one room flat, which was not untypical of the times.This is a film which I can watch again and again to immerse myself back in the 60's. It also made me want to see other slices of working class 60's life, Sparrows Can't Sing, and Fings Ain't What They Used to Be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost everything you want to know about life and love (and lust) can be found in "Alfie", a British gem that was recently remade. Michael Caine, in a career-defining turn, plays the lovable rogue, Alfie, who hits and quits the ladies until a health scare reminds him of his mortality and forces him to question his choices. Caine maintains a constant dialog with his audience by directly addressing the camera, offering a perspective on events as they happen. At the time, this hook must have seemed terribly fresh and novel, and it certainly does work a treat. Caine is totally amazing as the Cockney Romeo who hits mid-life pretty hard and finds the downside of his life's upside. Fortunately, the film does not come to any clichd conclusions and doesn't race towards a Happy Ending that will send punters home with a smile. There are some interesting erotic interludes and a great deal of humor, but the film's greatest strength is its wisdom. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

All is well in his world until one of his girlfriends, Gilda played by Julia Foster gets pregnant and gives birth to his son providing a temporary set back, but this is only the first in a series of events that makes him re think his views on life.The film has a great sixties feel to it and thanks to the excellent script, Caine's superb acting and a good supporting cast including Denholm Elliott, Shelly Winters, Millicent Martin and Alfie Bass sweeps through its almost two hour running time swiftly.Having just watched this again on TV the film looks crisp and clear as though it could have been shot in the present time.Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the light sexual comedy one might expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crumbs. I was expecting a light period vehicle for the carousing Michael Caine. Instead I got tough social realism, with no small amount of satire. It's also a technically interesting film with Caine addressing the audience directly by speaking into the camera. He remains in character, speaking in soliloquy rather than stepping outside the drama. It's effective, at once establishing the link of charm with the audience that might otherwise have been at a distance between characters, and makes the pain of the weave of stories all the more vivid.Alfie is not an unreconstructed Lothario. He's just self-deluded, mixing up his own, genuine growing pains with a warped, self-centred logic. Equally, the film isn't a proto-feminist tract. Although the women involved are independent characters the drama isn't ideological but domestic. Though the behaviour of the women from the contemporaneous London film Blow-Up is similar the two films are polar opposites in terms of their reach, Antonioni making a sublime thriller, Lewis Gilbert going inside, looking for the dramatic gemstone in the kitchen sink.He finds it, too. Caine is strong in Alfie (justly Oscar-nominated), notably when faced with the fall-out - literally - of another of his casual conquests. The support acting is mixed. Shelley Winters, Julia Foster and Vivien Merchant stand out from the women, with Denholm Elliott making a short but heavyweight appearance at the crucial juncture. London also features nicely too, although it still has a Dickensian gloom, not least with many shots with Thames-side industry for a backdrop (something that the enterprising Antonioni manages to escape). 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Caine: king of birds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine is truly spectacular, it's all in the eyes and the body movements. The writing as well provides a good basis of story telling beyond Aristotelian plot lines. watch for motif lines like "uncle Alfie" and the teddy bare intended for his son Malcolm. Alfie swinging from "Bird" to "Bird", the ending does not leave one with a simple and satisfying conclusion. Like life, a series of incidents and interactions stray powerfully from a carefully wrapped up typical feature structure. After staying strapped for the peak into this ladies man's life, one gets a truer sense of the man named Alfie as opposed to an exaggerated twists and turns of regular plot lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Caine gives one of his best performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfie is directed by Lewis Gilbert, has a screenplay by Bill Naughton which is based on his stage play. The film stars Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Denholm Elliot.Michael Caine gives one of his best performances as Alfie a young London man who gets through women faster than he does anything else in life. Charming, elegant and suave Alfie is attractive to every sort of woman and is never short of a date, he's a playboy and seems perfectly happy in his life however he never seems to grow up.Michael displays a various series of emotions throughout the course of the film and he gives one of his best performances here.In a shocking and very moving scene concerning abortion towards the end of the film we stop laughing at Alfie's antics and so does he.Denholm Elliot is memorable as a creepy abortionist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original, and best version....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the factors in this film besides the settings, cinematography and Michael Caine's character and voice over rationalizations for his behavior is: an accurate reflection of the times. The life of random feelings he seeks, by various means.It is interesting because, while we listen to his reasons for mistreating "birds" (women), having them scrub the floor, cook him steak and kidney pie while he is out drinking, we see his character transform, slightly. There is a scene where he sees a child, and family at a christening, and seems mystified as to what it is all about. This is the first time he looks outside his own behavior.The Shelley Winters character, his sometime lover, is one he arrogantly decides, ..."maybe Ill give her what she wants... I'll actually marry the old girl"... . By the time he attempts this, she gives him his comeuppance; she is having an affair, and now has no use for him.The soundtrack is excellent also. Do not miss. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, Mr. Law, but it wears better on Mr. Caine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No offense to Jude Law's valiant attempt at updating this late '60's masterpiece, but it's Michael Caine's movie, hands down! This is the quintessential Cockney cad, with all his macho bird stalking, his arrogant self-indulgent demeanor, his dissonant, mocking accent and lastly and ironically, his not-so-upper class lovability. You hate to love and love to hate the egocentric and misogynistic fool. Michael Caine knows this character to the hilt and delves effortlessly into this role.One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the plethora of asides to the audience. Alfie's juxtaposition of explaining the various situations in which he is involved and simultaneously confessing his "sins", as it were, is done with honesty, bordering on adolescent naivet. Caine understands all these contradictions in his character and exploits them to the fullest. Jude Law, in his rendition of the same role, tries to pursue the same tack as Mr. Caine but comes up just a little short of the master's rendition. Maybe it's a '60's thing and Jude is too young to understand!However, Alfie's vulnerability starts to manifest itself with his relationship with Harry Clamacraft, and further extends to Harry's wife, to Ruby (Shelley Winters), and also to seeing his own son with another family, totally removed from Alfie's world. Is it possible the old boy is getting a tad sentimental, having learned something from his playboy escapades? Not the same brash and cocky attitude he shows us in the female doctor's (Eleanor Bron) office! Or is he going to move along anyway, in the same old devil-may-care, self-indulgent "Alfie" fashion? Will he, in fact, find out what it's all about?Lastly, the entire sequences of events are ever so deftly punctuated by the Sonny Rollins group's riveting sound track. "Alfie", without this great jazz score, wouldn't be nearly as poignant, at least in my opinion. Not enough attention is given to the significant contributions of jazz scores in modern film making. I'm glad that a lot of people stepped up and commented positively on Sonny's work here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging character flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfie is a film about a promiscuous man and the situations and people that he interacts with. I can only imagine this is what all the people behind those "Confessions of a Window Cleaner...Taxi Drvier..." movies had in mind, before those dastardly executive producers got involved. Alfie is so far from the British sex comedy it may be marketed as it's quite astounding. The film has the tone of a comedy/drama, it's comic at times, has one or two harrowing scenes, and the central character has a remarkable depth, thanks largely to an underwritten script(in a good way - not to much information about the central character but enough hints as to form an interest) and Michael Caine's performance. It's also interesting to have a largely misogynistic character in the main role, and with him narrating direct to the camera produces a love-hate relationship with Alfie, (surely a brave move for any film) in which one minute you'll see him as charming cheeky chap, and a minute later as a downright pig. Alfie is a great character to spend some time with. He's not a role model, or a hero, or a villain, but a fully rounded, deep character who will hold your interest over the film's near two hour runtime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The egocentric lady-killer Alfie begins to become aware of his own misbehavior but can he still change? And isn't it too late already? - An excellent character study.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an excellent character study and period study of the '60's. It sheds some lights on some for '60's standards controversial subjects but it does this in a light enjoyable way, without making the movie too preachy, though its message still comes over perfectly.I wasn't too sure what to expect when watching this movie. Guess I expected another silly over-the-top British comedy but the movie turned out to be a light movie about some serious matters. Sounds like a weird combination but it works out perfectly.This is probably the definitive Michael Caine role. It's the role most people shall always remember him for and he had a hard time getting rid of his Cockney-image after this movie. The main character is rude, self-centered and over-confident. Yet the character intrigues and you never start to hate him. I think this says a lot about the way Michael Caine portrays him. He delivers one of his best, if not best performances, that you have to see to believe. He carries the entire movie and lifts it to a level of true excellence.It really is the main character that makes the movie and its story work out so fine. It sorts of even makes you forget that also the great Shelley Winters is in the movie, giving away a fine performance. Also Denholm Elliott shows up in a small but really great role.For its time "Alfie" is a quite daring movie. The subject of self-centered lady-killers isn't a much lighted subject. He messes around with married women, even women of men that he knows and even manages to get a married woman pregnant. Which brings us to the most controversial subject of the movie; abortion. He doesn't ever get emotional involved with any of them and drops them as soon as he gets bored of them or when they're becoming too difficult to handle or maintain a relationship with. It's a rude movie but the style it is made in makes sure that its more of a fun and light one to watch. This doesn't mean that the message about self behavior doesn't come across. Through the performances and style of movie-making the message still comes across perfectly and effective, in a non-forced way.The main character in the movie slowly begins to realize that this is not the right way to live. He's starting to age and his health is also starting to decline. He gets a couple of setbacks in the movie which are needed to make him aware of his own behavior. HE tries to change and settle down but is it possible to still set things straight and start living a new life after all those years of not caring? The movie subtle handles these questions and many more. It's all the more reason why "Alfie" is such a powerful and effective movie to watch.The movie is very style-fully directed by Lewis Gilbert, who later went on directed some fan-favorite James Bond movies. The constant talking-right-into-the-camera of the main character works great in an original narrative way and makes lots of things clear without wasting to much time on the images or dialog of a sequences. It helps to make "Alfie" a fast paced movie that is over before you know it. It also helps you to get involved deeper- and more easy with the main character.The movie also gives us an excellent realistic view in the '60's and the social life of the period. It sort of makes this an essential '60's viewing.An excellent, amusing and powerful mix of drama and comedy, with an intriguing main character and story filled with controversial subjects, without ever trying to shock or preach.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of chauvinism can't hurt in these PC times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I was annoyed by the seemingly awkward narration which consists of Caine talking to the viewer, which could have easily become distracting. A regular voice-over narration would have been just as fine, but one quickly gets used to this, too. A little tougher to get used to was Caine's damn cockney accent, so unless you're a cockney expert or a cockney yourself, you'd better watch this on DVD with subtitles. "Alfie" is a visually nice-looking, very 60s in some ways, entertaining blend of comedy and drama - a tough mix to succeed making a good movie from. There are no laugh-out-loud moments but the movie kept me interested for the two-hour duration (which actually became closer to three hours because I had to keep rewinding due to the occasionally incomprehensible cockney mumbling/slang). Alfie at one point refers to his house-girlfriend (hence all women) as "it", which almost made him appear like a David Attenborough type describing a couple of lizards on "Animal Planet".I can only imagine what a mess the new "Alfie" version must be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Essentially this is Saturday Night And Sunday Morning in color, with a few more 'birds' and a cockney accent. Albert Finney's Arthur Seaton worked in a large cycle factory (Raleigh) in Nottingham, dressed well and concentrated all his energies on Friday and Saturday night when he would go down the pub and pull a different bird every week. Along the way he became involved with married women as well as single til he reluctantly 'settled down' via marriage. Caine's Alfie Elkins also works indirectly in transport - for bicycles read limos - lives for the moment and sees his own Saturday night turn into a colder and lonelier Sunday morning than Seaton's (who at least had a wife to go home to when his carousing was done). It's difficult to fault Caine's performance though with a script like the one he had to work with he'd have had to be seriously inept to screw it up. I'd guess it had a far greater impact at the time that it does today - I caught it on BBC TV last week, some forty years on - and though it kept me watching til the small hours I doubt if I'd rush to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An adaptation of a novel, based on a stage play, based on a radio play, all written by the same author, no doubt this was quite popular in its time, and the speaking to the audience narration must have been quite unique back then. Nevertheless, the freshness of the narration soon dies down in this film version, as it has a tendency to ramble and it is often repetitive. The storyline itself becomes quite monotonous too, showing similar things over and over again. It is rather predictable, and Alfie is a bit hard to like as a character, with his misogyny outweighing his charm. Still, it is not a bad film overall. It has a few amusing segments, great colour lighting choices and a classic score to jazz up the material. Also, Denholm Elliott adds in a few sparks with his short supporting role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Golden Globe nominated director Lewis Gilbert (You Only Live Twice), this British film was one of the most talked about at the time of its release, and rightly so, there is no point mentioning the terrible remake with Jude Law, stick to this great original classic. Basically Alfie (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sir Michael Caine) is a young smooth talking cockney and ladies man, and his life, in the working classes of London, revolves around charming women and using them for pleasure without any emotional attachment. The film follows his numerous escapades with women in his life, those he is spending time with for sex, he keeps up his charming and positive persona and sees no harm in what he is doing, but he does find himself returning to some of the women he has been with, having left them with emotional devastation. As the film follows Alfie over a few years of the "swinging 60's", he speaks directly to us, the audience, in short monologues, with his opinions and advice about succeeding with women, or "birds" as he calls them, and what he does and doesn't like about them. It is when he is confronted by the realities of life in London and how his attitude and naivety towards women has caused devastating effects, including a health scare for him, and more prominently getting a girl pregnant, but in the end Alfie accepts his responsibilities and settles down, only to be disheartened, and questioning "what's it all about?" Also starring Golden Globe nominated Shelley Winters as Ruby, Millicent Martin as Siddie, Julia Foster as Gilda, Jane Asher as Annie, Shirley Anne Field as Carla, BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Vivien Merchant as Lily Clamacraft, Eleanor Bron as The Doctor, Indiana Jones's Denholm Elliott as The Abortionist, Alfie Bass as Harry Clamacraft, Graham Stark as Humphrey, Murray Melvin as Nat and Sydney Tafler as Frank. Caine gives a fantastic performance as the likable cheeky chappy who puts a smile on your face talking directly to camera, but of course he is also poignant with his troubles and vulnerability, it is a film that will make you laugh with the chirpy moments, but it also portrays the insightful material, such as the effects of thoughtless sex, including the still surprising abortion scene, overall it is a most watchable comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for the title song by Cilla Black, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best British Cinematography, Best British Film Editing, Best British Screenplay and Best British Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best English-Language Foreign Film, and it was nominated for Best Song and Best Screenplay. Sir Michael Caine was number 44 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 31 on 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfie (1966) asks "Are women worth the price men pay?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfie (1966) provides a laundry list of the many, many problems (large and small) men face when they become intimate with women.Money problems, health problems, social problems, emotional problems and on and on and on.The movie, Alfie (1966), is about the questions of intimate contact men have with women, and about commitment to women as an option men can choose, or refuse. Big subjects, both.Can individual men gain personal advantages by avoiding intimate contact and commitment to women? Yes.In about 1000 A.D., the Roman Catholic Church decided to vote "No" on marriage for its priesthood. There was a reason, and the incredible wealth and power of that organization down the ages is connected to that simple decision. It was profound, and still is.The Roman Catholic Church gained enormous practical advantages due to its decision, and individual men (including ones not at all religious or in any way connected to the Roman Catholic Church) can gain the same advantages by making the same decision. One "Comments" writer discussing this movie on this site compared it to La Dolche Vita (1960), another "laundry list of problems different types of women provide men" movie. Good comparison.Women are attractive, often, especially in youth, and so are favors they sometimes provide men. But.......... are the favors worth the price men pay (sometimes demanded by women, sometimes by others), and how long do the favors keep coming, and at what level of quality? Are women worth the price men pay? That is the main question the movies Alfie (1966) and La Dolche Vita (1960) present and ask.The clear answer is, sadly, "No." That's "what it's all about," Alfie.------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT*Having been born before this was released, I've heard of this movie my whole life, knew the song, etc. but never had the opportunity to see it.Well unfortunately that opportunity presented itself last week, and now I can see I didn't miss a damn thing the past forty years.He's a heel..so what? Does he have to brag about it?I'm not a big fan of actors speaking directly to the camera and he does that constantly here, usually only to justify his own actions. Meanwhile the other character that he just treated badly doesn't get to see the 'cute' side, they get the bastard.I also kept thinking ans wishing what this would have been like with Albert Finney in the title role. Out of the millions of movies Michael Caine has made, I can count the ones I like on one hand. Its weird cause I like him, I just don't like his movies. I see an actress named Vivien Merchant got a Best Supporting Actress nomination. She could have been any of at least three women. Denholm Elliot has a small part; years later, he'd lose an Oscar to Caine (Elliot nominated for "A Room with a View" and Caine winning, for some reason, for "Hannah and her Sisters).The only thing more amazing than the success of this movie is the fact that its one of the only times Shelley Winters doesn't raise her voice, bug her eyes or do everything she can to dominate a scene. Its a small part but she restrains herself. Maybe Jude Law's remake will improve on the material. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No doubt to a British audience forty years ago ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... this movie not only said something but was an evocative depiction of a particular way of life in a particular era.However, when I want to watch a documentary, I can do that. When I see a movie, I want to be entertained or edified. While Michael Caine - one of the most overrated actors of the era, IMHO - plays for the first time the bone dry solipsist he's done repeatedly in his career, his Alfie is an unpleasant slacker; he professes to care for various people down the road, but not enough to summon the motivation to do much for them or to keep them. The women around him are scarcely more pleasant themselves, succumbing quickly to some charisma they fancy they see (but the viewer does not), completely enslaving themselves at once for the occasional scrap of his attention and often being cajoled to support him in his dingy, barren flat. There is little sense of dramatic tension, and the plot line spirals downward to a predictable end.No doubt Alfie was daring in its day, but take away the shock value of the abortion issue and the unrepentant hedonism, and what DOES this film have, precisely?3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually enjoy Michael Caine's stuff, but this one left me feeling quite unfulfilled. I didn't think he carried the part particularly well, the acting and dialogue did not seem to be flowing naturally which I felt led to a quite stilted film.The story itself I also found a bit a grinding and monotonous...seeing as it was adapted from a play it may not have made the transition too well. The tale of non-commital, sleeping around and not taking responsibilities for your actions may have been quite riveting and fresh on the cinema screen in 1966 for a British audience, but now it just leaves one feeling cold.Maybe the movies biggest problem is simply that it has not aged well, both in style and structure.3.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Some films stay relevant; some adapt as the world changes and change their power. And others fade from relevance as the environment moves under it. `Alfie' is one of a large class of these ? films based on shocking by pushing a cinematic convention beyond its then state.Here we have something novel in its time: the contrast of lightness of attitude and heavy, even tragic consequences. This `comic tragedy' form was invented by Fletcher (and Shakespeare), and has since 1966 been revived and entered pop sameness.The hook this time is casual treatment of women. I recall this being apt and sharp in its day. A curiosity now, like `The Exorcist.' Some committed acting on the part of the women, mostly redheads and including the notable Jane Asher.She would go home to Paul McCartney just at the period when he was captivated by Alfred Jarry, and working on real ideas in theater.Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 ? you can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>
