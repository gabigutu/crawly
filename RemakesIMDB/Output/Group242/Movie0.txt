		<shortDescription>A galaxy of stars in a delightful comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of "Libeled Lady" shows its four stars walking arm in arm toward the camera. The stars being Jean Harlow, William Powell, Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy, some of the best actors working in Hollywood in the thirties!Only a studio like MGM could pull this coup. They had in its heyday some of the best and more radiant figures in its payroll. As a studio, it could gather the best talents working in those days and create fabulous vehicles for them to shine, which is the case with this film. This delightful screwball comedy with romantic overtones has kept its luster even after almost seventy years since it was produced. Jack Conway directed with a light touch."Libeled Lady" got away with a lot having been filmed before the Hays Code got its grip in everything that was produced in Hollywood in the succeeding years. The dialog is quite frank and sophisticated, even for that era. Jean Harlow had perhaps her best moment in the movies playing Gladys Benton, the woman who is engaged to be married and has her wedding postponed. William Powell, who was at the height of his career, and popularity, plays Bill Chandler, the man who is called to do a favor to the man that has fired him, by taking an interest in an heiress who is notorious for suing any newspaper that dares to print anything about her that is not true. Myrna Loy is the heiress, Connie Allenbury, who falls for the ruse that Bill Chandler is made to perform, but deep down she has fallen in love with him. Spencer Tracy is the editor of the newspaper in question, who concocts the plan to get the paper off the hook in paying the five million dollars.In supporting roles we get to see some of the best actors of the time: Cora Witherspoon, William Connolly, Charlie Grapevine, William Benedict, Bunny Beatty, and others that enhance the film with their presence.The film will not disappoint. It is one of the funniest comedies of that period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harlow's best movie, but Powell steals it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Powell must have loved the year 1936. It was the year he made "The Great Ziegfeld" (which won the best picture Oscar), "My Man Godfrey"(for which he was nominated for best actor), and one of the best screwball romantic comedies ever made. That picture would be "Libeled Lady". Although this film is widely viewed,with good reason, as one of Jean Harlow's best films, I think that Powell steals the picture and runs away with the best performance.Not that the rest of the cast is too shabby, either. Myrna Loy as the titled character, and Spencer Tracy as a newspaper editor from Hell, add to the madness and mayhem. And Harlow is at her best in her role as a woman who is engaged to Tracy, and married to Powell. That's as far as I'll go as far as the plot is concerned. Just see the movie.One of the best points about this film is the fact that it was made before the production code was put in place. Movies like this could be much freer with sexual situations and dialogue, while still leaving much to the imagination.The film is directed at breakneck speed by Jack Conway, who smartly, gets out of the way and lets his wonderful actors take over.If you haven't seen "Libeled Lady" yet, you must make a point of watching for it the next time it's on Turner Classic Movies. Then tape it. You'll be glad you did. You'll want to watch it over and over again.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man oh Man. Harlow, Tracy, Powell and Loy in one film. There truly were more stars at MGM than in the heavens. This is one of the best screwball comedies of the 30's maybe only out done by My Man Godfrey. The script funny as heck even by todays standards. The acting top of the line. Tracy was great at comedy it's great that MGM allowed him to do one every know and then. Loy is Loy classy, sassy, funny and witty. Powell at the zenith of his game and Harlow glows and steals the film. Harlow marching around in a wedding dress is a hoot. It's hard to believe that within a year Jean Harlow would be dead. If it's on TCM or you see it in a video store grab it and see what a screwball comedy really looks like</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsung, starry gem of a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with four stars of this magnitude was an event in 1936 and, indeed, it still is in 2004. Though the subject matter is slight and the acting is not too terribly taxing on the affable quartet, it was well-thought-of-enough to rate a Best Picture Oscar nomination. Tracy plays a newspaperman whose own wedding plans are interrupted by the fact that his paper has mistakingly run a libelous story about the daughter of one of his competitors. Loy, as the daughter, slaps a $5 million libel suit against Tracy's newspaper which, if won, will sink it. Since he knows he will lose, he rehires former employee Powell, who he feels will be able to charm Loy into an indelicate situation, thus rendering her reputation spoiled enough to cost her her libel suit. Part of the scheme, however, to make it seem legitimate is to marry off Powell to his own fiance (Harlow.) It is here that the film gets a lot of its laughs as desperate-to-wed Harlow finds herself getting married......but to the wrong man! Powell and Loy get most of the sparkling dialogue and sophisticated repartee, but contemporary audiences are likelier to get a kick out of mouthy, hilarious Harlow. Her comedic gifts (and her ample physical assets) are on prime display, notably when the judge says it's safe to kiss the bride and in a later scene where Powell is learning to fly-fish. All of the stars do very well and each gets a chance to rub up against the others. Powell and Loy are a legendary pairing with 14 films to show them off. Tracy does a slick job and shows his versatility. They are aided by a stable of amusing character actors, the type of people Hollywood was famous for and can no longer provide with regularity. (Today, almost any character actor that scores a hit is thrust into his/her own TV show, TV talk show or lead role in a film!) The film offers both wit and slapstick, wrapped up in some gorgeous sets and costumes. (The MGM gloss is fully in place.) Sadly, the light that was Harlow would be dimmed in just a year after this, but audiences are still able to enjoy her fine work in films like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spencer Tracy, William Powell, Myrna Loy, and Jean Harlow star in "Libeled Lady," about the attempts to convince a society woman to drop a lawsuit against a newspaper.Spencer Tracy is a scream in his role of a newspaper editor who has been engaged to Jean Harlow for some time, but his work keeps getting in the way of their marriage and relationship. His whole life revolves around his newspaper. When an heiress, played by Loy, sues the newspaper for libel, Tracy puts William Powell to work, hoping that by photographing them together, he can convince Loy to drop the suit. But it will only work if Powell is a married man caught cheating, so Tracy convinces Harlow to marry him.Harlow is her usual feisty self. Powell is marvelous, especially in his fishing scenes, which are classics, especially the one in which he literally chases a trout through a stream. It's laugh out loud material if there ever was any. Loy has the least showy part, though she's quite beautiful and works well with Powell, portending great things to come.This is a very enjoyable film with Tracy milking the comedy for all it's worth. Apparently his comedic work was a revelation back then, unlike today, when we know how adept he was at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always a pleasant surprise to run into one of Myrna Loy and William Powell's legendary pairings. "Libeled Lady" was even more pleasant than usual! Spencer Tracy is marvelous as the too smooth operator, while Harlow shrills her way through the film, stealing every scene.Still and all, the real selling point of this film is the clever drawing room dialogue and rat-a-tat-tat delivery! One does not see this type of intelligent comedic script come out of Hollywood these days. Full of double entendre, perfectly honed sarcasm and beautifully timed quips, this film keeps you smiling, even as you wince at Powell's adept physical comedy, full of falls and falls and falls. As for his co-star, watching Loy glow on screen is always magic, the moments that she raises an eyebrow and drops in a gem of a line, well, there's the real abracadabra...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One might wonder about casting 4 heavyweights in the same film-- any one of the leads could carry a film by themselves-- but all together you're afraid that they might either weigh down the film or, ala the "Dream Team" 1990, fail to live up to expectations. But this is one time you time you will not be disappointed-- with hysterical antics by Jean Harlowe, the always dependable repartee between classy Myrna Lowe and suave William Powell, and Spencer Tracy proving for the first time that he can handle snappy dialogue like the best of 'em-- the chemistry between the cast makes every scene in this film a delight.The banter flies so fast you'll miss it-- this is the height of screwball comedy.

		<shortDescription>An extremely funny movie - and boy can William Powell land fish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LIBELLED LADY is a comedy about the world of newspapers and libel suits. Spencer Tracy is the editor of a leading New York newspaper, and he is about to marry his long-suffering girlfriend Jean Harlow (they have put off marriage several times in the past due to scoops Tracy had to pursue personally). This time it's not a scoop, but a serious blunder. The foreign gossip correspondent has submitted an item that got printed concerning Myrna Loy's antics in England, suggesting that she disgraced herself when drunk. This is bad enough, but the newspaper owner (Charles Goodwin) is horrified by this error. It seems Loy's father is multi-millionaire mover and shaker Walter Connolly, who had political ambitions that Goodwin and his newspaper thwarted twenty years earlier. Goodwin realizes that an angry, vindictive Connolly will very likely sue the newspaper for libeling his daughter, and win disastrously large damages.While Harlow shows up in her wedding gown, fuming at this new delay, Tracy figures he will have to bury his own feelings and approach one time rival and foe William Powell to help him here. Powell is very clever at manipulating situations to get rid of troublesome problems (i.e.: he can possibly figure out a way of neutralizing the advantage Connolly and Loy have in the original libel article). Powell does come up with a scheme. If he can ingratiate himself with Connolly and Loy, he might be able to create a compromising situation regarding Loy that if revealed will make the libel story appear to be true. Tracy agrees to this plan, even though it requires Powell to marry Harlow, so that Loy (when she falls for Powell) can be made to appear a home wrecker. Harlow (at first) is not too thrilled about this, as she and Powell don't get along.What follows is a series of delays that prevent the rapid evolution of the plot and it's proper springing on the unsuspecting Connolly and Loy. First it is harder to get Connolly away from his regular business interests to take an interest in Loy's new acquaintance Powell. But Powell finds the key when he learns that Connolly is one of the best trout fisherman in the United States. However, Powell himself has never bothered about fishing - we see him cramming from various books to learn the difference between fly fishing and other types. Then we see him practicing casting a fishing line with the assistance of E.E. Clive in the hotel rooms he shares with Harlow. He manages to snare Harlow while doing so (again much to her anger).Invited to go to Connolly's favorite fishing spot, to try to catch the elusive "old wall eye", Powell manages to just miss drowning himself in the river, and does catch the fish the hard way - with his clothing. But it impresses Connolly and Loy. The scheme is seemingly working, but three new wrinkles develop. Powell finds he is falling for Loy. Harlow is slowly finding the gentleman Powell is a nicer role model for a husband than the belligerent Tracy, and is now falling for Powell. Tracy (who barely tolerates Powell) is discovering that Harlow is less interested in him than she was before, and more interested in Powell - so Tracy is now jealous of Powell.I will only add that the comedy ends with four people arguing it out in a hotel suite. Very fine comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At the Top of their game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Libeled Lady is yet another screwball comedy about a ditzy heiress. But it certainly is one of the best that came out of the Thirties. All four stars are at the top of their game in this one.The ditzy heiress is Myrna Loy. Some drunken correspondent from London filed a false story and Myrna and father Walter Connolly want to sue the paper. Owner Charley Grapewin and editor Spencer Tracy are worried. In fact Tracy has postponed his wedding to sweetheart Jean Harlow for the umpteenth time to meet this crisis.He hires back former star reporter William Powell to get something on Loy. Tracy and Powell hatch a scheme that would involve Powell marrying Harlow temporarily and then wooing Loy to get her in a compromising position. Of course the long suffering Harlow actually agrees to this piece of insanity.I'm convinced that Harlow's character is the model for Adelaide in Guys and Dolls. Adelaide put up with almost as much before she finally landed Nathan Detroit. It's hard to believe that a year later, Jean Harlow was gone.Myrna Loy is not stepping too much out of character as the heiress. Her role her as Connie Allenbury is only about three steps from Nora Charles. She's a rich woman in the Thin Man also, indulging hobby Nick in his hobby as a detective away from his full time profession as drinker.The women had worked with each other before and both male leads had played with both women before. But this was the only time that MGM heavyweights Spencer Tracy and William Powell were ever in the same film together. That in itself is reason to see Libeled Lady.The single most hilarious scene for me is Bill Powell trying to fish in order to get in with Loy and Connolly. His scene in the trout stream landing 'old wall eye' is priceless. In fact Powell's battle with the fish was the premise for one of Rock Hudson's best comedies, Man's Favorite Sport.And Tracy proved he could play sophisticated comedy. No doubt the reason MGM cast him with Katharine Hepburn later on.Simply the best. Right up there with My Man Godfrey and all those sparkling comedies Tracy did with Hepburn later on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This MGM goodie has Jean Harlow and Myrna Loy, both strong characters who know exactly what they want to get from Spencer Tracy and William Powell ... all four principals in the cast are excellent, especially Harlow and Powell (any scene connected with fishing is funny, especially Powell's attempt to land the great trout). Walter Connolly is also good value as Loy's father.'Libeled Lady' is fast-paced, with lots of good moments concerning the plot around a newspaper - a would-be marriage - an heiress - a boat - and some great over-the-top scenes.

		<shortDescription>Flawed, But Entertaining Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Robert Osborne expressed the opinion that this film was better than the film that won Best Picture of the year in 1936, and was one of the very best screwball comedies ever, I was super-excited about seeing it last night on TCM. It was even nominated for Outstanding Production (Best Picture), while in the same year My Man Godfrey was not! For my money My Man Godfrey is a far superior film.The acting quartet of William Powell, Myrna Loy, Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow is an incredible ensemble. To me, nobody stole the show; Powell, Loy and Harlow were all fantastic; and Tracy, in his first comedy role is very good. Walter Connolly is also outstanding as Loy's millionaire father. All were deserving of nominations, in my opinion. Do not blink, you won't want to miss a moment of dialog. They never miss a beat in the rapid-fire quips that characterized films (especially, but not only, comedies) of this era. There is nothing like it today. What a shame that writing such as this has become a lost art!However, it is the writing in this film that, in the end, left this movie a couple of notches below My Man Godfrey. The dialog is scintillating throughout. But the ending fails to live up to the lofty expectations established by the rest of the movie.Without any prior hints, we are taken by surprise by the "illegal Yucatan divorce" that William Powell uses to show that he did not really marry Jean Harlow. Coming out of the blue, it is not only pretty contrived, but smacks of the kind of device that Truman Capote rails against in the classic, Murder by Death, when he accuses the assembled mystery novel writers of introducing new characters and unforeseen plot twists in the last chapter to solve mysteries in a way that is completely unforeseeable to their readers. In Libeled Lady, however, there is not just one, but two such surprises. Harlow counters Powell's illegal Yucatan divorce with a legal Reno divorce that is unknown even to Powell! Harlow's diatribe is outstanding, and she nails the other characters who have simply been manipulating her to achieve their own happy ends. That speech, however, is not dependent upon the double divorce contrivance, and it could have been used in any alternate scenario.Another weakness of the ending, is Spencer Tracy. As Tracy prepares to depart, Myrna Loy suggests that he has forgotten something. He says, "Oh, yes, my hat." He doesn't convey any emotional involvement with Harlow. He kisses her goodbye, saying something like, "See ya later." This indicates, at best, that Tracy expects to resume his same old relationship with Harlow, focusing his real attention on the newspaper. Harlow is fantastic, and we hope that her fate is better than to be stuck with the same Tracy who has ignored her for their entire relationship. For the ending to be truly happy, Tracy needs to show that he has learned that he needs to demonstrate affection toward Harlow, rather than pay it lip service. But the evidence seems to show otherwise.In fact, at the movie's "happy" conclusion, Harlow and Powell are still married. Loy and Powell are not. And Harlow is stuck with Tracy, who we aren't real certain has seen the light. For this to be a real classic, the ending should have been a little less contrived and some of these loose ends should have been tied up. As is, things seem too unresolved, leaving us feeling slightly unsatisfied. Consequently it is an extremely enjoyable screwball comedy, but it is a step or two below the classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Powell and film are excellent; Spencer Tracy a bit of a drag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent film that is hard to categorize accurately. It has elements of screwball comedy, but is not as furiously paced and/or dependent upon ridiculous set-ups as most screwball comedies. It is sophisticated comedy, yet doesn't have the "drawing room" feel that many sophisticated comedies of the 1930s have. This is partly due to several well-staged "outdoor" scenes, and the fact that the characters played by William Powell, Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow are lower middle-class rather than upper crust or cocktail-shaking types. In addition to his usual excellent delivery of witty lines, William Powell gives an agile physical performance that is a delight. He plops himself, attired in a suit, cross-legged onto a table, he stands on a chair in the hotel living room and practices fly casting, and he ends up belly flopping in a trout stream in one of the funniest scenes I have ever watched on film. Myrna Loy is enjoyable as the libeled lady of the title, although I wish she had been given more to do. My only quibbles with this film are the performances of Jean Harlow and Spencer Tracy. Harlow has several good lines, but seems too rough and tough for the part she's playing. It's as if she's playing a gangster's moll, but this is not a gangster film. Tracy is heavy-footed and seems out of place in a comedy. Fortunately, Powell's performance is strong enough to carry the film, and he manages to lighten Harlow and Tracy's performances whenever they share a scene with him. Libeled Lady is enjoyable, funny and another success for William Powell.</fullReview>

There are all sorts of comical twists and turns and plenty of good gags and amusing moments.

		<shortDescription>Amusing, but flawed, comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all have our biases concerning favorite actors and actresses. The more of I see of Myrna Loy and William Powell, the more they impress me, and Libeled Lady doesn't disappoint. However, I feel Spencer Tracy was miscast; I didn't find him very funny in this movie. And as for Jean Harlow, she was at times amusing, but after awhile her overacting got under my skin. I agree with one reviewer that at times she was behaving like a gangster's moll. However, her evolving relationship with Powell was a nice twist. The middle section where William Powell goes fishing was a refreshing change of pace, especially with the outdoor setting, though his ineptness was a bit over the top. I wonder if they derived some inspiration for the fishing sequences from Buster Keaton's 1923 short, The Balloonatic. For me, the scenes with Loy and Powell were by far the most satisfying. I doubt he has an equal in delivering witty lines oozing with biting sarcasm. I strongly disagree with many of the reviews rating this one of the greatest romantic comedies ever, even comparing it to My Man Godfrey. While that movie had one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen (with Powell delivering a surprising, brutally honest, assessment of the family he's been working for), the ending to Libeled Lady is a dreadful contrived mess that attempts to dismiss rather difficult complications in noisy, albeit trivial, fashion (as if they had no idea how to end it). Nevertheless, it's well worth the watch to see William Powell in top form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wealthy socialite Myrna Loy and her father Walter Connolly sue for the sum of five million dollars the newspaper Spencer Tracy works at for libel for a story that claimed Loy was chasing after a married man. Tracy convinces smooth William Powell to first marry Jean Harlow, who is Tracy's long waiting fiancée, and then to attract Loy's interest enough to get alone with her in order to show that she really is the kind of woman that was suggested in the original story. Powell, perhaps because his part puts him in society as he gets closer with Loy, is probably the most fun to watch, while both Tracy and and Harlow have their moments, but are both forced to run around too much in order to carry out the elaborate and increasingly ridiculous plan. In this regard, Libeled Lady seems to get a little too strained along the way, and the way is a bit too long as well, thus diminishing its comedy value somewhat, though it is still plenty funny and witty enough in parts to be recommendable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gold-plated classic comedy that shows off the famous MGM star-system at its best. Having Myrna Loy, William Powell, Jean Harlow AND Spencer Tracy in the one film wasn't really that clever for economics, but the audience (and Povert Row studios) just drools. The star foursome pretty much re-hash the screen persona's developed in earlier films, but they do it so well that it's a joy to watch. William Powell once again shows he is the definition of suave, and his light, elegant comedy technique remains relatively unmatched. Was any woman in 30's cinema as scrumptious as Myrna Loy? Jean Harlow delivers her lines like a hot machine gun, while Spencer Tracy is perhaps a little less impressive than the other three. This film has a classic trout fishing scene that is absolutely delightful, and very funny. The writing is top-notch, and everyone looks so glamorous. Directed routinely but solidly by Jack Conway, a long-time MGM studio hack, "Libeled Lady" doesn't really introduce anything new in the way of cinema, it's just an enjoyable farce from wonderfully skilled farceurs.</fullReview>

Interrupting his impending wedding to shapely blonde Jean Harlow (as Gladys Benton), Mr. Tracy hires conceited writer William Powell (as Bill Chandler) to battle Ms. Loy. Claiming Mr. Powell could charm even Garbo, he arranges to have Powell wed Ms. Harlow, then pursue Loy. The men hope to create an actual scandal, between Loy and a married man, to get her to drop the lawsuit...Predictable romantic entanglements ensue, but it's done with great comic flair. Walter Connelly heads a fine supporting cast, with future "Bowery Boy" William "Billy" Benedict getting in some of his better bits. "Libeled Lady" was, sadly, one of the soon-to-be ailing Harlow's final films, and she is marvelous. The "Academy Awards" put the picture on their ten "Best Picture" roll, along with veteran director Jack Conway's "A Tale of Two Cities" and Powell/Loy winner "The Great Ziegfeld", which today seems one of the lesser efforts on the list. And, oddly, Powell's "Best Actor"-nominated "My Mad Godfrey" didn't make Oscar's Top Ten.******** Libeled Lady (10/9/36) Jack Conway ~ Jean Harlow, William Powell, Myrna Loy, Spencer Tracy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering that this film was made by MGM and starred some of the finest stars under contract with them at the time, it's hardly a surprise that this film was extremely watchable and fun. Just think--the film starred Myrna Loy, William Powell, Spencer Tracy AND Jean Harlow!! It's like you are getting twice the usual film rolled into one! And they all did a wonderful job in the film--particularly Powell and Harlow.Spencer Tracy plays a relatively heartless guy who has been stringing along the same girlfriend for years (Harlow). When a crisis erupts on his wedding day, Tracy is thrilled to have an excuse not to tie the knot and jumps into the thick of things. It seems that a false story accidentally was run in his newspaper and now the rich débutante (Loy) and her father (Walter Connelly) are suing for $5 million dollars! So, the scheming Tracy hires William Powell to discredit Loy by using his sophisticated manly charms. Then, according to this plan, Powell's wife will respond by suing Loy--a clever and very mercenary ploy to avoid the first lawsuit. But, since Powell ISN'T married, Tracy (the big cad) asks his fiancée (Harlow) to marry Powell!! Of course, the wedding is all a shame, but any man who would ask his own fiancée to marry another is just a colossal jerk--and that's exactly what Tracy is in the film.While this is just a broad overview of the first 20 minutes or so of the film, it sets the stage for the rest of the film. At first, Loy and Powell do NOT hit it off at all, but after a while nature takes its course and the film continues at a fast and funny pace until its wonderful conclusion.The film deserves kudos for having an excellent script and direction--MGM did NOT just rely on its stars to bring in the money, but actually pulled out all the stops to make an excellent film. While the movie is not exactly a "screwball comedy" (it's a little more sophisticated than that), it is nearly one and does provide some excellent laughs--mostly when watching novice Powell try to fish like an expert.

		<fullReview>After I got my head around the slightly complicated plot of classic romantic comedy Libeled Lady (which stars some of the most famous and talented actors of all time), I found myself very much enjoying this tremendous screwball comedy ? perhaps the best of all time. It is surprisingly up-beat, witty and funny? however, it is not-so-surprisingly classy, sophisticated, charming and glamorous (what else could you expect with Jean Harlow, William Powell, Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy!?).Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) is chief editor of the New York Evening Star, which has a notorious past of making celebrities very, very angry! One of those celebrities ? one they have picked on for a long time ? is heiress Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy, cute as a button!), and she is seriously not happy. The New York Evening Star accidentally published a fake story about her, claiming her to be a marriage-breaker. She's hitting back hard with a $5 million dollar lawsuit. However, the canny Haggerty has a plan up his sleeve? he will get his fiancé Gladys (Jean Harlow, who has been waiting for years to get married, but Haggerty is always needed at work on the Big Day!) to marry Bill Chandler (William Powell) ? a smart, suave chap with a Lady Killer past. After the unconsummated nuptials, Bill has to meet Connie Allenbury, work his charms on her and get someone to find them in a compromising position! The claims will be proved, the lawsuit would be dropped and Haggerty would have a load off his mind? but things don't happen so easy! Yes, it's slightly complex, but it's oh so rewarding! There's lots of couple-matching, switching so you have to be on the ball! Watching Powell, Loy, Tracy and Harlow is pure cinematic magic ? they bring such energy to the screen! As this is the 1930s, expect lots of classic, glorious, glamorous dresses from the gals, and lots of sophisticated suits from the guys! I could watch it for the fashion alone. This exceptional screwball comedy is not to be missed ? it's a very witty picture that certainly keeps you on your toes ? you don't know how it's going to work out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening credits of Libeled Lady are not your typical list of screen names, instead we get footage of the four main stars walking arm in arm very happily as their names come on screen one by one. Four heavy weights in roles which play to their strengths, giving some of the best dialogue the screwball comedy has to offer. Libeled Lady is my favourite newspaper comedy, a world in which journalistic ethics are nonexistent and people struggle to make relationships and careers in journalism mix. Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) is so preoccupied with his job as the managing editor of a paper he has missed his own wedding several times, so no surprise Jean Harlow gives a very comically angry performance throughout most of the film.William Powell's Bill Chandler has such cool and confidence, he even draws his own contract which will bring him back to the paper he was sacked from as knows Warren Haggerty will come looking for him following a scandal. Powell gets the chance to show the full range of his comic abilities, not only as a master of words but also gets showcase slapstick comedy similar in vain to Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin during the film's fishing scene. The subplot of Bill Chandler learning to fish would be the basis of Howard Hawk's comedy Mans' Favorite Sport?. Despite how incredibly fast he picks up the ability to fish like an expert, it doesn't feel contrived. A portion of the story is spent trying to find William Powell with telephone, telegraph and radio as their means of communication. Outdated aspects like in old movies always intrigues me and makes me ponder if stories like this could be told today. With the internet and other modern communication devices, they could have been able to recall those newspapers at the start of the film. Likewise publications today are no less obsessed with covering the escapades of socialites and people famous for being famous. But Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy) is not typical socialite. She is down to Earth, has an image distorted by the media and can even outwit the paper. It's appropriate this role would be played by Myrna Loy, the so called only good girl in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Gladys Benton's (Jean Harlow) frustration, editor Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) cancels their wedding to attend to an emergency at his newspaper. The New York Evening Star published a false story by their drunken reporter about socialite Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy) being a husband stealer. The paper's owner Bane is an old rival to Mr. Allenbury and his daughter Connie vows to sue for $5 million. Haggerty recruits rascal Bill Chandler (William Powell) to solve the problem. Chandler comes up with a scheme to make the story a reality. Chandler marries Gladys and then tricks Connie into stealing him.The start is a lot of ridiculous fun. The manic energy is infectious. Jean Harlow is a ball of energy and has great fun with Tracy. They're a great combative couple. The real life couple of Powell and Harlow isn't that bad either. The main couple is yet another Powell and Loy affair. Powell does some slapstick fishing. Their romance is tough to get into since Chandler is suppose to be faking. It's a bit murky at the start. Harlow keeps it wacky. This is generally a load of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never seen this before, the picture was nominated for exactly one award, and that was for a Best Picture Oscar in 1937. Though it didn't win, MGM, along with William Powell and Myrna Loy couldn't have felt too bad. They all had a hand in that year's winner, "The Great Ziegfeld".The premise here was just ripe for a screwball comedy and the principals delivered. Powell, Loy and Jean Harlow were all established comedy players at the time, but this was new territory for Spencer Tracy who had only appeared in dramas prior. With his performance here, his range was established as an all around actor and set him up for all those great Katherine Hepburn team-ups in years to come.The picture moves along at a pretty fast pace and you have to be as quick as the players to keep up with the dialog. You also have to accept the premise of Powell's character Bill Chandler marrying someone else's fiancée in order to stop a libel suit against the New York Evening Star. It's the kind of situation that lends itself to constant back and forth maneuvering between the players who jockey for position in order to come out on top.I would never have figured Bill Powell for such a physical actor, but when he hit the trout stream I couldn't believe all the pratfalls he took in service to the story. Coming up with the most elusive trout in Glen Arden was the icing on the cake. I fully expected old Wall Eye to slip away from that net but son of a gun, he wound up on a dinner plate after all.So anyway, Nick and Nora fans ought to be happy with the finale here, as Chandler and Connie Allenbury (Loy) wound up tying the knot at the end of the story. In real life, Powell was courting Jean Harlow at the time and was set to marry her following this picture until her untimely death shortly later. It put Powell into a deep funk for a long time before returning to the screen to begin the sequels to the Thin Man series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast in a superb comedy plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Libeled Lady" has several things that make it a top comedy romance and among the best comedies of all time. First, it's one of more than a dozen film pairings of William Powell and Myrna Loy. In the golden age of Hollywood, they were the most famous and well-liked matched couple on the silver screen. Second, "Lady" also has an all-star cast beyond the famous duo, with Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow as co-stars; and a first- rate supporting cast. Third, this film has one of the very best comedy plots of all time. Fourth, it is a sterling satire of yellow journalism that flourished well into the 20th century. Then, pepper the story with witty lines here and there, some hilarious situations, and what may be the funniest fishing scene ever filmed, and voila! One of the very best comedy romances of all time. I wonder if Powell's trout fishing sequence wasn't an inspiration for writers of the 1964 movie that was all about fishing and romance ? "Man's Favorite Sport." "Lady" was nominated in a field of 10 excellent films for best picture of 1936. It was up against some powerful competition, and Powell and Loy starred in the movie that won best picture for the year, "The Great Ziegfeld." This isn't a rollicking laughter film. It's plot is simple yet with complex twists throughout. The script and production are excellent in not tipping what happens next. The film is always one step ahead of the viewer. Powell plays Bill Chandler, Loy is Connie Allenbury, Tracy is Warren Haggerty and Harlow plays Gladys. Harlow got first billing when it came out. She was at the peak of her career at only age 25. She and Powell were between marriages at the time and were serious about marrying, before her untimely death the next year from poisoning due to kidney failure. Nobody could play the angry, indignant female as well as Jean Harlow. Tracy's Haggerty is an excellent portrayal of what must have been typical for many of the newspaper editors of the day. He lived for flashy headlines to rope in the readers. Truth and accuracy were only important to the extent that they prevented libel suits against the paper. Haggarty is in a couple of direct jabs at the press of the day. After killing a phony front page, an editor asks him, "What will we use for a new headline?" Haggarty, "I don't care. Anything. War threatens Europe." Editor, "Witch country?" Haggarty, "Flip a nickel." Later, Haggarty tries a sob story on Connie to get her to drop the libel suit, and she outdoes his every line. Then her dad comes in ? Walter Connolly playing Mr. Allenbury, and says, "And you can tell your owner, Mr. Hollis Bane, we're not entertaining any representatives of his yellow rag in this house." Haggarty, "I'll make it a point of telling him. You're entertaining no representatives of the Evening Star."Movie buffs know at the start that we're in for a delicious comedy by the message on the screen that rolls right after the credits. "The events and characters depicted in this photoplay are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental." Hmmm. I wonder if there weren't some real people whom the viewers of 1936 might have made a connection with in the film.Shortly after meeting on the ship, Bill and Connie are dancing. Bill, "I should say that dancing isn't exactly my line." Connie, "I should say it was part of your line." Bill, "Uh, hmmm? Ho, ho, ho. May I be frank with you?" Connie, "Why not?" Bill, "You dance superbly." Connie, "I was hoping for something more original." Bill, "Heh, heh, heh. Oh, dear, life is so full of disappointments." A short time later: Bill, "I'm afraid I wasn't concentrating. It was your eyes." Connie, "Beautiful, aren't they?" Bill, "They remind me ?" Connie, "Yes. Yes, I know. Sparkling diamonds, deep sapphires." Bill, "No. No, they remind me of angry marbles."The film is replete with hilarious sequences like this. Bill and Connie, Haggarty and Gladys, Bill and Gladys, Haggarty and the paper owner, Hollis Bane, played superbly by Charley Grapewin. Here are some more samples of hilarious lines and exchanges. Editor, "I can't bust up his wedding." Managing editor, "If we don't, it's our funeral."Bill, "I thought that was rather clever." Connie, "Yes, I thought you thought so."Haggarty, "They're married, all right." Gladys, "But that's arson." Haggarty, "You mean it's bigamy."Gladys, "That's Warren for you. Crazy about me, but boy how he conceals it."Bill, "You're one girl in a million." Gladys, "You don't know the truth of it. You wouldn't believe the things I've stood for." Bill, "I know." Gladys, "The first night I met the guy he stood me up for two hours "Haggarty, "She may be his wife, but she's engaged to me."Gladys, "You'd make your crippled grandmother do a fan dance for that newspaper."Justice of the peace, "And don't forget to invite me to your silver anniversary." Gladys, "It'll have to be within the next six weeks."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwballs, fastballs and curves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the best movies of the thirties, the stars are glib (in the best way) and glamorous. Libeled Lady is blessed with a clever script that serves up fastballs that the cast handles adroitly. And I have to credit the amazing wardrobe by Dolly Tree, made all the more remarkable as she was responsible for the wardrobes of 23 films in 1936. Loy's wardrobe, in particular, is impeccable.This was the 5th in the series of William Powell/Myrna Loy pairings. They were cranking them out at a rate of about 2 per year during this period, so you might think that the chemistry between them would be stale or formulaic. But in Libeled Lady, the chemistry is fresh and the relationship between their characters is not just another Thin Man performance.Then there are Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow. Tracy is adept at the machine-gun delivery required by this (screwball) comedy, and Harlow just shines, showing more depth of character and emotion than she is sometimes given credit for. After Libeled Lady, she only acted in two films, so the screen never saw what greater depths of performance she might have achieved. (She died of uremic poisoning during the filming of Saratoga Trunk)The plot involves a newspaperman (Powell), good at the con, who ingratiates himself to a wealthy young woman (Loy) and her father in order to set her up for a blackmail situation. She suspects his motives, but he manages to pull her in. Plenty of plot curves ensue, adding humor and more character development.I particularly liked the fishing scene. Without much dialogue it advances the plot, provides some laughs and shows that Dolly Tree can even make Myrna Loy look sexy in fishing gear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not prime Tracy, but a good screwball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had only watched this movie once before, and watched it this time specifically because I am reading the new Spencer Tracy biography. There is one trait of Tracy's acting which is brought up over and over in the biography, and one that I recognized long ago since Tracy is one of my two favorite actors -- call it what you will either subtlety or understatement. But as I have watched so many of Tracy's movies over the past few years, I have realized that in his earlier years, Tracy did not always utilize that trait. Perhaps he hadn't fully realized that it was underplaying roles that was what made him a true movie star. You'll see it in "Fury" (1936) and "San Francisco" (1936), but you won't see it here. Here Tracy is just another actor, and that's fine, but this is not one of those Tracy roles that one will savor. Then again, it's a screwball comedy, so perhaps director Jack Conway didn't allow Tracy to play the role in that manner.It is a funny concept -- newspaper slanders a young society dame (Myrna Loy) and she and her father (Walter Connolly) sue. One of the newspaper's bigwigs (Tracy) gets the idea to hire a sort of slick playboy reporter (William Powell) to romance Loy and get something on her...hence the lawsuit will disappear. But of course, there are drastic complications.Tracy and Jean Harlow may have gotten equal billing here with Powell and Loy, but make no mistake, this is really a Powell and Loy picture...and particularly Powell. In fact, although I'm a dedicated Tracy fan, I've never seen Powell more engaging and funny. The best lines are his, and the fishing segment is hilarious.Highly recommended comedy with fine performances by Powell and Loy...perhaps better than they were in the Thin Man series. And a special recognition for character actor Walter Connolly. Well worth a spot on your DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four stars at their best in this classic directed by Jack Conway. Warren Haggerty(Spenser Tracy)is a hard working dedicated newspaper man, who has put off his wedding to Gladys(Jean Harlow)probably one time too many. His paper has ran an erroneous article accusing an international society playgirl Connie Allenbury(Myrna Loy)of being a home-wrecker; she threatens to sue the newspaper for five million dollars. Haggerty connives a scheme to stop the lawsuit, by talking a former colleague Bill Chandler(William Powell)into temporarily marrying his fiancée Gladys and trapping Miss Allenbury in a "real" scandal...thus hoping to force her into dropping her lawsuit. This movie is fast paced and funny. Most of the best lines go to Ms. Harlow, who actually steals the show. The funniest sequence is watching non-outdoors sportsman Chandler trying to fish for trout. Trust me...this is a comedic gem. Also in the cast: Walter Connolly, Charley Grapewin, Charles Trowbridge and Cora Witherspoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LIBELED LADY (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1936), directed by Jack Conway, ranks one of the finest and richest of all screwball comedies of the 1930s. A newspaper comedy where much of it takes place outside the newsroom. A Jean Harlow movie where she's not the basic character nor title role. A first-rate cast supported by MGM's top stars, William Powell, Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy, performing as a couple or threesome with individual scenes before gathering together in one big climatic finish. With such assortment of agreeable players and witty script, LIBELED LADY was no doubt a box office success. Nominated for an Academy Award as Best Picture, losing to Powell and Loy's very own musical biography, THE GREAT ZIEGFELD (1936). As for the basic story, read all about it.Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy), managing editor of the New York Evening Star, learns from its owner, Hollis Bane (Charley Grapewin), that a story about Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy), daughter of a millionaire tycoon, James B. Allenbury (Walter Connolly), accused of stealing another woman's husband, is proved false. Unable to stop the presses, the newspaper now faces a $5 million libel suit by the Allenburys, vacationing in England. Haggerty, about to marry divorcée, Gladys Benton (Jean Harlow), leaves her at the church to locate the whereabouts of former reporter turned author, William Stevens Chandler (William Powell), the best man to handle libel suits. Regardless of their personal differences, Chandler agrees to help Haggerty by making the story come true. Agreeing to have Gladys marry Bill in name only, he arranges for a trip to England where he is to meet Miss Allenbury on her return trip to the states on the Queen Anne, romance her under observation of a hired detective, and arrange for Gladys, the jealous "wife," to walk in on them unexpectedly, resulting to a meaningless libel suit. The plot nearly works until Bill and Connie actually do fall in love, leaving Gladys with both husband she dislikes and fiancée she loves, while Haggerty thinks up some more underhanded schemes to cancel the libel suit, to hilarious results.So not to be sued for slander, the MGM writers of LIBELED LADY covered themselves by flashing these now familiar words on the screen: "The events and characters in this photo-play are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental." It's hard to imagine such characters and incidents ever existing except on the theater screen for entertainment value. Aside from occasional yelling, screaming, and bitter confusion, from its opening titles complete with underscoring to the song, "You," as introduced in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, to its wild conclusion, LIBELED LADY is a fast-paced 98 minute farce. Of its major stars, William Powell comes out ahead as a smooth talking operator with all the answers. Even some of the film's greatest moments involve Powell, including his marriage to Harlow where he gets a slight kiss from the bride who in turn gives the biggest kiss to "best man" Tracy; Powell's unusual trout fishing method to impress the financier (Connolly) and his daughter, only to accidentally succeed; Powell's love/hate relationship with Harlow as they pretend to be "happily" married; and finally the calm emotions during the Powell and Loy romances. The Tracy and Harlow combination also strike up some great moments with he placing the newspaper ahead of the girl he loves, having her to constantly ask, "If you don't want to marry me, just say so!" or quip as them "becoming parents to little headlines." Walter Connolly, best known as Claudette Colbert's millionaire father in Frank Capra's IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (Columbia, 1934), is not to be overlooked in his participation through all the confusion, especially when belting out a great big yell of, "Will you all please BE QUIET!" before having a nervous breakdown.My initial introduction to LIBELED LADY didn't come from the late night television viewing but in a revival movie house, New York City's Regency Theater on Broadway and 67th Street in January 1981. Placed on the double bill with Harlow's dramatic HOLD YOUR MAN (1933), as part of the theater's new theme, "MGM Winter," LIBELED LADY not only made a great impression on me, but others in attendance as well. More than once the sounds of laughter drowned out some rich dialog, making this great viewing experience with an appreciative audience to a movie made so long ago. While LIBELED LADY turned up on television a few months later, on Saturday evening's "Movie Greats" on New York's WNEW Channel 5, regardless of some edits to fit in commercial breaks into a two hour time slot, it was just as funny as ever. Availability on video cassette and later DVD assures LIBELED LADY lasting appeal.Remade by MGM as a musical titled EASY TO WED (1946), starring Van Johnson, Esther Williams, Lucille Ball and Keenan Wynn in the Powell, Loy, Harlow and Tracy roles, the new Technicolor edition was surprisingly good on its own terms, but not quite a carbon copy to the original. Both films turn up occasionally on Turner Classic Movies. (****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Classic 1936 Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoy Classic films and this is one of my favorites with great super stars. Myrna Loy, ( Connie Allenbury) plays the role as a very rich and spoiled gal who loves to file law suites against newspapers and she is out to destroy Haggerty, (Spencer Tracy) who is a newspaper reporter who wrote a story about her that was not true and she is charging him with a 5 Million Dollar law-suit. Jean Harlow, (Gladys Benton) is engaged to marry Haggerty and they both plan on getting married soon but this law-suit upsets his plans and he asks a good friend of his, Bill Chandler, ( William Powell) to cause a scandal with Connie. However, romantic things happen between these couples and the outcome is rather hard to explain. There is great acting and lots of comedy with all these great veteran actors and you will never be able to guess how this film ends. It is a shame that Jean Harlow had to pass away at such a young age and at the height of her career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't as entertaining as I expected it to be, considering it's been touted as one of the 30s best examples of screwball comedy.The problem is not with the direction, which is competent enough, and certainly not with the performers. William Powell, Spencer Tracy, Myrna Loy, and Jean Harlow. How could they go wrong? They fit perfectly into their diverse niches.No, it's the screenplay that is lacking. It prances along, accompanied by chipper music, but the dialog does not scintillate, neither do the awkward situations provoke laughs.William Powell is trying to seduce high-maintenance Myrna Loy and to succeed he must get close to her father by pretending to be an expert fisherman, and fishing is a topic he knows nothing about. Howard Hawks did it at least as well in "Man's Favorite Sport," one of Hawks' lesser efforts.Well, "Libeled Lady" has its reputation, and maybe at the time I was suffering from another attack of agenbite of inwit, a diagnosis my psychiatrist has foisted on me, along with those curious pills that do nothing for the disease except make you not mind having it. Maybe you'll get more out of it.</fullReview>

For my taste there was too much contrivance and over-the-top plot devices. I know, I know, everyone liked it, awarded high ratings and, truth be told, there were some laughs, but it was just too cute by half.

		<fullReview>I cannot overestimate how much I love this film. People compare it to "My Man Godfrey". Guess what? That film is not even close. Carole Lombard was not even remotely as beautiful as Jean Harlow, and she should not even be mentioned in the same breath as Myrna Loy. The two fishing scenes with Bill Chandler (Powell), first where he hooks Gladys (Harlow), and the second, where he catches "Old Walleye", and after taking a beating trying to land the fish, and cannot even take the hook out, is a sight to behold, and those scenes surpass the shower scene in "Godfrey." This is without question Powell's film, and he steals every scene he is in. But guess what? Who wins? Connie Allenbury (Myrna) that is who. Spoilers ahead: She makes Newspaperman Haggerty (Tracy) look pathetic when he tries to talk her out of the lawsuit, she actually proposes to Powell (What other woman did that in a film?), and in the final scene when Harlow will not give up Powell, she shows who is boss to Harlow, and until her dad (Walter Connelly) came in and yelled "Quiet", Harlow was going to suffer a serious smack down. Needless to say, Loy and Powell will end up together and Harlow will still be chasing after Tracy. There is not a single wasted moment in the entire film (Particularly the Powell and (or) Loy scenes)Which is why it is my favorite comedy of the 30s. is my favorite comedy of the 30s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to fish - watch and learn. Can Powell reel in Myrna Loy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy) is suing a newspaper for $5 million. The editor Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) realizes that he has to hire back Bill Chandler (William Powell), a man he previously sacked, as Bill is the "best in the business". Bill comes up with the scheme to catch Connie in a compromising situation with himself and use this as a bribe to stop her from filing her lawsuit. First, he must marry Gladys (Jean Harlow) for maximum impact on scandal factor. However, Gladys is engaged to Haggerty and can't stand Bill! This makes for a humorous beginning. The rest of the film follows Bill's attempts to entrap Connie. Gladys and some photographers are to storm in and catch Bill and Connie together, and thus save the newspaper. Things don't go as planned...The film has an excellent cast. I think William Powell steals the acting honours but that is just opinion. Jean Harlow has some fantastic outfits - check out those fluffy sleeves! - and the sets are great. The film is funny with an enjoyable cast that breeze through this easy-going film.Sometimes the dialogue can be delivered in that slightly too rapid fashion but it is never irritating. The ending is all rather convenient but so what. I also think it would have been funnier and created more tension between Bill and Heggarty if Bill had suggested that he marry Gladys instead of Heggarty. Poor Gladys has continually had her wedding day scuppered by Heggarty's dedication to his newspaper. Bill could have really added insult to injury by suggesting the idea of himself marrying Gladys. I never quite knew how the film would end with both Gladys and Connie falling for Bill and I found this added an extra dimension of interest to the story. As the story progresses, we see Gladys and Bill getting more and more friendly.The film transports you into another time - black and white film world - and it's great being there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film for the first time, and it was delightful. I very much enjoyed it. But apparently, I'm just about the only one who didn't think the fishing scene was especially funny. Indeed, my thanks to the one other reviewer who felt the same way, I feel less alone in the world. What *I* loved was the sparkling dialog. Very, very funny. I particularly loved the scene when Spencer Tracy has discovered William Powell at Myrna Loy's house, and they have this meaningful conversation, made up entirely of pleasantries which are going right over Loy's head.My gripes are pretty minor. I too thought Harlow was a bit too shrill to be funny, and very much agreed with the comment that she comes off as more of a gangster's moll than someone who is a suitable match for the editor of a major New York newspaper. The blame for this seems to lie with the director, who instructed her to be "broad". A bit too broad for my tastes; I liked her better in her quieter scenes.I also agree with some comments I've seen about the ending, particularly the way that Tracy just seems like a jerk when he starts to leave the hotel room, forgetting only his hat. The character really is too ambiguous about whether he cares for Harlow or not. He generally seems not to, so when he suddenly starts defending her honor at the end it seems rather out-of-the-blue and contrived.And I didn't care for the very ending, when the father comes in and they all talk at once. Not particularly funny, and way too abrupt. The movie should've gone out on a stronger note. I would've liked to have seen more denouement: just how *did* they clean up the bigamy situation, for instance? I thought it would've been nice if the movie managed to wrap around back to the beginning, and we see the four all having a double wedding together. One idea I had: how about if, after they are all wed, and everything is happily wrapped up, if Loy were to come out and admit that, oh, by the way, the original newspaper story that started the whole mess... was actually true, and not libel at all. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching Schubert's "Trout Quartet"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trout fishing fiasco is the most hilarious scene in film history while the film itself, is the best comedy ever made. There, I've said it. The four superstars (the word "superstar" unknown 70 years ago)obviously are enjoying what they are doing to the point that their performances do not seem to be work at all -- this a phenomenon I have never seen before in over 70 years of movie-going.One scene, overlooked by the other contributors here, I believe deserves kudos. That one is the ocean-liner trip where Powell duels verbally and unsuccessfully for the most part, with Loy.The final hotel scene mayhem is wonderfully funny with all the stars' previous machinations useless in the face of the final marriage revelation which upsets all their plans. All they can do at this point, like a group of children, is blabber incoherently to Walter Connelly, who unable to hear anything, screams "Quiet, please!!" A fitting ending.Watch for Dennis O'Keefe, later a star himself, in a short uncredited role as a barker at the charity bazaar.Notice at the beginning of the film the four walking arm in arm, from left to right: Harlow, Powell, Loy and Tracy. Following the storyline, Harlow should have been linked with Tracy but with a real-life twosome of Powell and Harlow at the time, it is likely the wishes of these two "superstars" to be linked together prevailed over MGM's probably mild protests.Another on the list of those "the likes of which we will never see again".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lady shines forth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched "Libeled Lady" for 35 years in rep houses. It has legs and class. Ed Sikov charts the corkscrew arc of screwball comedy in his 1989 book SCREWBALL. I would hold that "Libeled Lady" (1936) remained MGM's finest entry into the screwball stakes until "The Philadelphia Story" (1940) upped the studio's ante.Columbia birthed the genre with "Twentieth Century" and "It Happened One Night" (both 1934). Universal's "My Man Godfrey" (1936) enriched the breed considerably. Paramount and RKO introduced Cary Grant into the mix through "The Awful Truth" (1937) and "Bringing Up Baby" (1938).Warners may have given us the classiest screwball ever in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (1935), Shakespeare by way of Max Reinhart, William Dieterle, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold. William Powell and Myrna Loy collaborated with Dashiell Hammett early in the game to give screwball turns to cinema marriage and the mystery genre in "The Thin Man" (1934), though that's not a pure example of the form.I like the simple definition that screwball comedy involves a pursuit relationship between a man and a woman, marked by inversions of the social order. The pursuit relationship takes a natural course in "Libeled Lady". William Powell sets off to end a libel suit against the Evening Star. This quest broadens into love for Myrna Loy, who correctly suspects him of ulterior motives for his attentions to her.Inversion of the social order certainly slips in. Working people labor to upset the apple cart of a rich father and daughter, who seek to smash the Evening Star after 20 years of political enmity. Yet the film artfully sidesteps the naked social satire of "The Front Page" (which Howard Hawks transformed in 1939 into a screwball divorce masterwork, "His Girl Friday").The most radical inversion of our expectations may lie in jettisoning the entire class struggle--no small feat in the Great Depression. The wealthy Allenburys don't appear as oppressors or mindless sybarites, nor do they represent a wholesome aristocracy under assault by Bolsheviks.The common folk neither champion social causes nor shine forth in natural virtue. No one's noble, no one's iniquitous. All seem equal under the eye of Heaven. You don't find that in Frank Capra's later populist movies.Further, we have a film that made bigamy funny in the 1930's, in the teeth of the Production Code, the Roman Catholic Legion of Decency, and grassroots Bible Belt principles.Five gifted performers help to dampen any outrage. "Libeled Lady" accords Powell and Loy more dignity than they'd get from "I Love You Again" (1940) or "Love Crazy" (1941), though the script musters less purring wit than their Nick and Nora Charles exploits. Spencer Tracy gets to roar and bluster in a very James Cagney vein.(Pause a moment: Could you envision a Warner Bros. "Libeled Lady"? Star Errol Flynn as Bill, the dapper libel-suit quasher. Have Olivia DeHavilland undertake Connie, the offended heiress. Let Cagney do Warren, the commitment-shy newspaper editor. Either Una Merkel or Glenda Farrell could suffer as his fiancée, the sublimely frustrated Gladys, whose road to the altar proves long and devious indeed. I think this imaginary version would gallop friskily, a typical Warners knockabout farce, but it would lack the pervasive elegance that MGM built into its actual production.) Though asked to play Gladys very broadly, Jean Harlow still has some subtle moments. Watch when she tells Powell that he's a strange egg. "Wife Vs. Secretary" (1935) had presented her in a subdued mode, gentle as a whisper. "Libeled Lady" chooses to use her mostly in brassy counterpoint to Myrna Loy's soft woodwind.Walter Connolly, though only five years older than Powell, portrays a very well-heeled father with all the skill accumulated in a career filled with canny industrialists, money men, outraged parents, and elder statesmen. "The Bitter Tea of General Yen" (1933) and "Twentieth Century" gave him stronger sidekick roles, but no one ever did more to flesh out a stereotypic part. His only rival at comic authority figures remains Eugene Palette (ideal for my Warner Bros. fantasy).Jack Conway's direction defines workmanlike. Gregory La Cava or Leo McCarey would certainly have spent more time with the script and the actors to refine more metal from the ore. However, Conway does a briskly pleasant job.This film does not have the character depths of "My Man Godfrey", nor does it reshape a screen persona the way "The Awful Truth" re-molded Cary Grant from mere leading man to an icon of the art form. We don't see the sublime mayhem of Howard Hawks' pioneering screwballs.Yet MGM's star factory knew how to produce highly polished entertainment week in and week out. "Libeled Lady" glistens lustrously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I greatly enjoyed the film, an excellent example of films of its era. Powell and Loy are a great couple as always, and Harlow has one of her better roles here as well. The set up is similar to other stories of the era, particularly "The Gay Divorcée" (aka "Gay Divorce"), but the resolution somewhat more complex.Some standout scenes: Powell scolds Loy for her excessive lawsuit over libel "I didn't realize you were so valuable, $5 million?".Also really liked the way Tracy handled the scene where he discovers Powell living at Loy's house.Solid movie, not the greatest in the "screwball" genre, but not the worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delightful screwball comedy with a quartet of stars in top form. Loy is the title character, libeled by Tracy's newspaper. Tracy and Powell concoct a scheme to get Loy to drop her suit. Harlow is Tracy's neglected fiancé. Powell and Loy, building on their marvelous chemistry from the Thin Man movies, are absolutely charming. Tracy and Harlow, in one of her final films before her untimely death, display a great flair for comedy. It will have you chuckling throughout but the scene where Powell goes fishing with Loy and her father (Connolly) is probably the funniest. This was nominated for Best Picture Oscar but lost to "The Great Ziegfeld," which also stars Powell and Loy! Including "After the Thin Man," Powell and Loy teamed up for three movies in 1936, but this is the best.</fullReview>

Though Powell stole most of the screen time and did a very good job, Jean Herlow was also equally good and funny as hell.This movie also taught me that newspapermen had always followed/stalked rich-&amp;-famous people, even way back in 1936. I had been under the impression that the group of stalkers known as Paparazzi (the word being derived from a Fellini's Pararazzo from,"La Dolce Vita"), became infamous much later; obviously, I was wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Possible Spoilers** A libel suit, filed against a newspaper that knows it won't have a leg to stand on in court, triggers a chain of events that plays havoc with a number of relationships in `Libeled Lady,' a classic romantic comedy directed by Jack Conway. On his wedding day, newspaper editor Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) is summoned back to work before he ever reaches the church; there's a crisis at hand, and he's responsible, albeit indirectly. In his absence, another editor allowed a libelous story to make the front page; a story alleging a dalliance between a certain Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy), one of the richest women in the country, and a married man. When, at the last minute, the paper discovers the story is false, the edition is recalled, but it's too late; fifty copies make it into circulation, and Connie Allenbury sues the paper to the tune of five million dollars. If they can't convince her to drop the suit, the paper is ruined. That's a tall order, however, for the Allenbury's have a long-running feud with the paper (twenty years), and Haggerty knows there's only one way to deal with it: They have to catch Connie Allenbury in a compromising position. It just so happens that a former employee of the paper, Bill Chandler (William Powell), is an expert at handling such matters. According to Haggerty's plan, Chandler will court Miss Allenbury, and when the time is right, his wife (along with a photographer) will catch them in the act. But first, the single Chandler needs a wife, and it has to be a legal marriage that will hold up in court. And Haggerty has just the woman for the part: Gladys (Jean Harlow), his own bride-to-be, still smarting from being left alone at the altar. He convinces her it will be in name only for one month, after which time she will enjoy a six week vacation in Reno (allowing for the divorce proceedings), and after that, everything's jake. When she agrees, knowing how much the paper means to Haggerty, it begins a comedic interlude with a new twist arriving at every turn. The legendary Harlow is an absolute delight here, as the spunky Gladys, the girl taken for granted for too long, and who enters the fray determined to get what she really wants: A loving husband. Tracy is right at home as the fast-talking newspaperman, married to the job and too thick-headed to realize what a treasure he has in Gladys. Loy is charming as the sophisticated Connie, the guarded aristocrat with the down-to-earth sense of who she really is, and Powell is marvelous, bringing a subtle, self-deprecating sense of humor to the ever-gentlemanly Bill Chandler. This is a funny movie, with some truly memorable scenes, especially one in which Chandler first learns how to fish, then must put his newly acquired `skills' to the test during a fishing trip with Connie and her father, Mr. Allenbury (Walter Connolly), who is an expert fisherman. Watching Chandler being put through the paces is a riot. The supporting cast includes Charley Grapewin (Mr. Bane), Cora Witherspoon (Mrs. Burns-Norvell), E.E. Clive (The fishing instructor), and Billy Benedict (Johnny). With outstanding performances all around, `Libeled Lady' is a joy to watch, from beginning to end. The story is clever, the dialogue witty, and it's all charmingly put together and delivered by Conway. And there's a kind of graceful ambience to this film that keeps the humor fresh no matter how many times you see it. This is timeless entertainment, a classic depiction of human nature that rings as true today as it did all those many years ago when it was created; a priceless connection to another era, of another time. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Stars, Heavenly Script and a Constellation of Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'More Stars Than There Are In Heaven'.That was MGM's oft boasted statement during the 1920's &amp; 30's, &amp; this was no shallow brag, as by 1936, MGM had an enviable amount of talent on their books, &amp; judging by the principal cast of Libeled Lady, they didn't need to spread this talent too thinly either.With the exception of MGM's 1932 classic 'Grand Hotel', most studio's had seldom strayed from the 'two huge stars plus handful of familiar character actors' format when casting their movies. MGM were to break this rule again in 1936 with this wonderful screwball comedy, as the movie was to star four of Metro's then biggest assets, (Spencer Tracy, Jean Harlow, William Powell &amp; Myrna Loy). To depression era audiences, the maths were simple, four popular stars, for the price of one ticket stub. Because of this, Libeled Lady was always going to do well upon release, but I'm sure no one involved ever thought that the movie would still be finding an appreciative audience over 70 years later, because when it comes to sheer enjoyment of an easy going film with lot's of good laughs, they seldom come better than this.Tracy plays Haggerty, a newspaper editor &amp; marriage shy fiancé of the eager to marry Gladys (Harlow). After Haggerty's newspaper prints a fabricated story regarding the socialite Connie Allenbury (Loy), &amp; her philandering with a married man, while holidaying in England, his wedding to Gladys gets delayed while he rushes back to the office to sort out the problem. It is here that an irate Gladys informs us that this is not the first time that his dedication to work has interrupted the couple's nuptials.After the paper is told that Connie &amp; her father J.B (Walter Connelly), intends to sue for $5 million, Haggerty decides he has to track down &amp; join forces with his old enemy, &amp; former employee William Chandler (Powell), who's experience in combating libel cases seems to be the paper's only salvation.After offering his services to Haggerty for an extortionate fee, Chandler shares his plan. He will find a girl to marry him, &amp; then sail for England purely so he can sail back to the States on the same ship as The Allenbury's. He will then use the five day cruise to successfully infiltrate the Allenbury's inner social circle, lure Connie into what could be classed an 'intimate' situation, leaving his faux wife free to sue Connie for alienation of affection thus, destroying any chance of Connie successfully suing the paper. Haggerty agrees with the plan &amp; even contributes to it by offering his own fiancé as the sacrificial wife.Gladys, however, is furious at her fella's attempt to marry her off to another guy, but devoted to him enough to go through with the scheme. The scene depicting this sham wedding is hilarious, because the JP cannot understand the bride's contempt for the groom &amp; her obvious romantic leanings towards the best man. After acquiring enough witnesses who can vouch for his married status, Chandler sets sail across the Atlantic.In England, Chandler enlists the help of some British newspaper men to purposely harass Connie, so he can wade in at the right moment get rough with her attackers &amp; be seen as a knight in shining armour by both Connie &amp; her father. The ruse pays off, when Connie's father invites Chandler for Cocktails that evening.In order to 'butter up' J.B, a well known angling enthusiast, Chandler rents every book in the ships library on trout fishing so he can brush up on the where's, why's &amp; what for's of a sport in which he himself has never partaken. Although J.B seems enamoured by Chandler, Connie is less than impressed &amp; although still unaware of his true intentions, sees Chandler as someone who's not what he appears to be &amp; for the rest of the voyage, manages to avoid Chandler &amp; the dastardly liaison he's trying to engineer.Haggerty is not happy when he hears about Chandler's failure but is re-assured when Chandler tells him that he's been invited on a fishing trip by the Allenbury's &amp; a plot is hatched for an emotional Gladys to present herself at the Allenbury's Glen Arden fishing lodge.However, in order for the couple to still appear married, Chandler &amp; Gladys have to stay in the same hotel room overnight. Gladys, needlessly worried that Chandler has aspirations to extend the façade to the bedroom, ensures a locked door remains between them. It is only when she wakes up unmolested, that she starts to feel some romantic aspirations of her own.After a brilliantly played out fishing scene, (which is the film's masterpiece), in which the inexperienced Chandler manages to capture the biggest trout in Glen Arden, Connie finally starts to succumb to Chandler's charms, &amp; before evenings end, Chandler &amp; Connie both realise that they are very much in love.Chandler, no longer wanting to embarrass Connie, yet still protecting himself, &amp; knowing full well that Gladys is now also in love with him, tries everything to keep the two apart. This involves a lot of hilarious manipulation of all our protagonists.Haggerty, thinking that Chandler has not only stole his fiancé, but abandoned the job he was hired to do, visits the Allenbury Home to plead for Clemency, only to find Chandler &amp; Connie together. Now realising that both he &amp; Gladys have been duped, Haggerty covertly starts some manipulations of his own to ensure that a fiery climax to the fiasco is not going be too long in coming.All four of our stars give Oscar worthy performances but special praise has to go to Walter Connelly as after 1934's 'It Happened One Night', the 'Heiress's Father' role always seemed to fit him like a glove.Libeled Lady is nothing short of a milestone in screwball Comedy.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of the prior comments are right on the money about this brilliantly written and acted 1936 comedy, but I would question is it really deserves to be considered a "Screwball" comedy.Like all furniture from the 1930's is classified as "Art Deco", many very funny comedies from the pre-war sound era is called "Screwball", and I would suggest that for a comedy to be properly classified as "Screwball", it has to be a bit more crazy, a bit faster, and not quite as situational.This wonderful certainly has some 'Screwball" elements, but it's as much of a high comedy.I wish people who classify films of the 1930's would be a bit more thoughtful about which film belongs in a category without rewriting the style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Screwball Comedy That Never Quite Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A moderately funny film that tries for a screwball zaniness that it just can't quite deliver. Its biggest selling point is the quartet of stars that headline it, four of the biggest MGM had to offer at the time: William Powell and Myrna Loy (who had already struck gold as a team in "The Thin Man"), Spencer Tracy (just on the verge of winning back-to-back Oscars) and Jean Harlow, trying (and failing, in my opinion) to prove herself as a comedienne.Tracy plays a newspaper reporter engaged to Harlow, who can't ever quite get around to marrying her because of his devotion to his work. Loy is a society girl who is slandered in Tracy's paper. Tracy sends Powell out on a mission to put the moves on Loy so that the slander will be fact and save his paper from a libel suit, a scheme which also entails that Powell and Harlow pretend to be married. Things get complicated (as these things do) when Powell begins actually falling for Loy and no longer wants to trick her, and Harlow begins actually falling for Powell, much to the dismay of Tracy, whom no one seems to fall for.This all sounds like it should be the makings of a grade-A comedy, but somehow it's not. The movie is always amiable, but rarely does it take off as a screwball comedy the way other comedies from the same time, like "My Man Godfrey" or "Bringing Up Baby", do. Much of my resistance to the film lies in the casting of Harlow, an actress I simply can't stand. Every time I see her in anything, I can't help but think how much better Ginger Rogers would be in her place -- they had the same look and played the same types, but Rogers had a graceful way with comedy and Harlow clunks around, always looking like she's trying too hard. No complaints about the other three though, especially Myrna Loy, one of my favorite actresses, who looks absolutely adorable in this.The film is worth watching, though, for one scene: William Powell trout fishing. I'll say no more.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some stars simply suit each other so perfectly that it is a shock to find out that their partnership is only on screen and confined to a delightful friendship off-screen. That's the case for William Powell and Myrna Loy, permanently tied together by 1936 after two "Thin Man" movies, "Manhattan Melodrama" and "The Great Ziegfeld". Both sophisticated yet down-to-earth, they have that martini set look with an occasional beer thrown in. Here, they are tossed together by accident, he a reporter out for a scoop on one of the world's wealthiest socialites, leaving fiancée Jean Harlow at the alter which brings rival Spencer Tracy into the picture to pick up the pieces. This ensemble cast of likable yet beautiful people is a delightful example of what made screwball comedy so popular in the post-depression/pre-war years with lots of zanies in the background, including Walter Connelly as Loy's anxious father and Cora Witherspoon as an annoying social climber.As in all of his comedies, Powell gets into a most embarrassing predicament filled with pratfalls, and here, it is a fishing excursion that sends him rushing down a roaring river after a huge fish. Like Mame and the hunted fox, it all ends up an accidental victory, the egg on Powell's face quickly turning into a delighted grin. Loy is at her sophisticated best as a sensible woman in satin who brings her nose down to earth and can give as equally as much as she gets. Harlow is delightfully sassy with Tracy basically in support yet excellent in his second banana role, obviously aware that it is the quality of the script rather than the quantity of his scenes that count.</fullReview>

A young(er) Spencer Tracy always has, in my opinion, one of the "cleanest" voices in Hollywood history. Whenever I think of the prototypal American voice, his alway comes to mind first.

Tracy hires William Powell to handle it--they decide to marry him to Harlow, have him romance and seduce Loy and bust in when they're in a compromising position. Naturally, everything goes wrong.Classic comedy--and rightfully so. It's very funny with some hysterical lines, BUT it falls just a bit short of being a true classic for me for a few reasons. I found Loy's character very annoying and she herself seemed uneasy in the role. I love Harlow but her constant screaming here got on my nerves--she's more than a bit shrill. And I found Powell's trying to fish very unfunny and the movie got too clever (and complicated) at the end. But these are minor complaints and easily overlooked. Powell and Tracy are both in peak form and the film moves like quicksilver. If one line doesn't work, don't worry--they'll be another one in a few seconds. This and "Bringing Up Baby" are two true screwball classics. Worth catching.One of the many great lines: "She may be his wife but she's engaged to me!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie begins with a society lady suing a disreputable newspaper for libel over a fallacious story about her being a marriage-breaker. It's a perfectly legit claim, considering how much society individuals were covered by newspapers then, how reporters were prone to stretch the truth, and how easy it was to claim libel. Even the newspaper's solution - hiring a glib charmer to frame the plaintiff - is probably common practice then.Though William Powell and Myrna Loy - as the framer and framee who eventually fall in love - have great chemistry, being one of the most often paired actor-actress teams (they have been in fourteen movies together), their scenes pale in comparison to those with Spencer Tracy's smarmy editor trying to sleaze his way out of the lawsuit by manipulating the players in the game.

At the time of the film Powell was engaged to Harlow. She died the following year while he was filming Double Wedding another teaming with Loy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good comedy film with a great cast and great performances by these Hollywood legends.The cast seemed to enjoy doing the film and that certainly made the film even more fun to watch.Loy looks very stunning here and Powell sure displays his charm.An even better screenplay and cinematography would have made this one a masterpiece.Only for screwball comedy fans and big fans of the lead actors......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable comedy gets big lift from William Powell's performance...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WILLIAM POWELL, an angler who has to prove his finesse with fishing by joining MYRNA LOY and WALTER CATLETT for a fishing trip, is hilarious as he flounders around the stream running after a trout he has accidentally "hooked". It's this fishing scene that is the highlight of LIBELED LADY and provides some of the funniest sight gags as he belly flops several times in an effort to prove himself a fisherman.The rest of the comedy is strictly screwball material, with SPENCER TRACY as a newspaperman angling to rid his newspaper of a libel suit by MYRNA LOY by putting her in a compromising position with Powell. JEAN HARLOW is the desperate gal who wants a wedding ring on her finger from Tracy, but has to go along with a scheme that includes a fake marriage to Powell. She gets on the nerves after awhile.If this sounds familiar, it should. It was remade by MGM as EASY TO WED starring Esther Williams in the Myrna Loy role, with Van Johnson, Lucille Ball and Keenan Wynn, given splashier looking Technicolored sets and some swimming routines from Esther.What hurts this version of the story is JEAN HARLOW, much too strident as Gladys and with those pencil thin brows that always gave her a cheap look in close-ups, and SPENCER TRACY, not ideal for a role that should have been played as light comedy. Apparently he refined his comedic technique several years after this film when he co-starred with Kate Hepburn.WALTER CATLETT is perfect as Loy's father and MYRNA LOY has never looked more fetching than she does here. Too bad her role is a bit underwritten, but her chemistry with Loy shines through despite this handicap. They play off each other beautifully.Well worth watching and hugely enjoyable just to watch WILLIAM POWELL go through his paces. His fine comic style has never been more evident.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Libeled Lady" (1936) is a sparkling romantic comedy of errors. When commitment shy newspaper editor, Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) finds that his newspaper is being sued for alleging that a socialite, Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy) is a home-wrecker he delays plans to marry his fiancée Gladys (Jean Harlow) yet again, by placing her in the midst of elegant playboy, Bill Chandler (William Powell). The idea is to have Gladys and Bill marry so that Connie will then be fooling around with a married man - hence Warren's paper will be off the hook for printing the initial story. But the plot goes hopelessly and predictably awry when Gladys starts to have genuine feelings for Bill and he for her. So what's a struggling foursome to do? Director, Jack Conway fleshes out this thimble of a plot with a series of hilarious vignettes and some really stellar acting from the cheap seats, including cameos by Charles Grapewin, Arthur Connelly and Cora Witherspoon - all instantly recognizable war horses from MGM's ever expanding stable of second string talent. "Libeled Lady" may be light and fluffy, but it certainly packed a wallop at the box office.Warner's DVD treatment is below par. The black and white image has been mastered from very grainy, dirty and softly focused elements. Contrast levels are barely adequate, though at times weak. There's a hint of edge enhancement and some fine detail shimmering. Fine details are sometimes nicely realized. Film grain is intense. Age related artifacts are present throughout. An audio only radio broadcast is the only extra included.</fullReview>
