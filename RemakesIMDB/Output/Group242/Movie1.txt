		<shortDescription>Stolen By Lucy . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the other comments here indicate, it's highly instructive to compare LIBELED LADY to this remake, EASY TO WED. A decade brought a huge difference in style between the Thalberg-approved slangy courtship of slapstick repartee and the plush, earnest romance of Louis B. Mayer's MGM of the '40s.Lucille Ball steals this picture with a very well-judged comic performance, aided by director Edward Buzzell, who clearly throws many scenes her way. What will surprise those who know her primarily from "I Love Lucy" is to see how much of her comic shtick is already on view here, completely developed and intact. The drunk scene, the little voices, the 'takes,' stares, reactions and expressions are familiar in every way as Lucy Ricardo. Ball also never looked more beautiful than in this film, with her hair as metallic and bright as a new penny, and in a series of witty and gorgeous costumes by Irene, who does just as well by Esther Williams.But those who are critical of Ball's performance, particularly in contrast to Jean Harlow's in LIBELED LADY, are right. Harlow was a natural, a wonderful, winning and unique personality, whose blustering scenes of anger were always justified, always expressing her common sense and dignity. The dirty little secret about why Lucille Ball never made it as a movie star was that despite her professionalism and beauty, she was essentially a strident and cold personality. What Harlow did naturally, Ball works very hard to achieve so that we admire her pyrotechnics without ever warming up to her. By the time of "I Love Lucy" she had begun to disguise her intensity with clutziness and feigned vulnerability and stupidity. And like Katharine Hepburn, she learned that if Lucy was reined-in by a man once in a while, audiences could forgive her for her aggressiveness.There is relatively little of Esther Williams' swimming in this picture. At this mid-'40s point, MGM was pushing her versatility to see just how much she could do, how far she could go. I happen to think that her screen presence (even when out of the water) is underrated. She had a refreshing, no-nonsense self confidence that is very American, and she was sexy in a way that is never blatant. The fact that this statuesque beauty with her strong physical presence and perfect carriage never acts seductively or coyly creates an unexpected sexual tension, especially in her early films (she lost a bit of it later as her body became thicker and more athletic). You can see how some would feel moved to ruffle her composure, warm her up, 'get' to her in some way, because she seems oblivious to her femininity while brimming over with it. Which is what makes her seem an emblematic American movie star. In the first half of this picture she gives a good account of the kind of frigid glamor girl that Alexis Smith often played at Warners.' When she finally melts, it's lovely, though she is better photographed in both THRILL OF A ROMANCE and THIS TIME FOR KEEPS (where she rates closeups by Karl Freund that make her look almost impossibly, lustrously beautiful).A word about MGM's '40s Technicolor -- I love it. Many films from this period as screened on TCM seem to have been saved, restored, remastered for video tapes and DVDs. All of Esther Williams' color films from the mid-'40s are a visual treat with bright, deeply saturated color and sharp images, though a few scenes in EASY TO WED seem unaccountably muddy and soft, with desaturated color. And in one scene Ball wears a frosty blue costume that we have been told is green. Maybe they should take a look at this print before they put this film out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lucy Shines in Comedy Showcase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few times at MGM Lucy was given a chance to exploit her full comedic range, and she goes at it with gusto. From the moment she makes her whirlwind entrance looking absolutely gorgeous in a white wedding gown, she commands the screen whenever the camera is on her. In fact, though the movie ostensibly "stars" Van Johnson and Esther Williams, the bland leads take a back seat to the lively pairing of Lucy and Keenan Wynn, as her somewhat morally corrupt boyfriend. Forget comparisons to "Libeled Lady"; "Easy to Wed" is of a different era, and much more slapsticky, and, as noted, Lucy is a gem whether getting drunk and playing the piano or evincing true pathos as a wronged woman. She has rarely been photographed more appealingly, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Libeled Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musical remake of "Libeled Lady" doesn't come close to matching the 1936 screwball classic but is mildly entertaining. Williams, Johnson, Ball, and Wynn are no match for the stellar cast of Myrna Loy, William Powell, Jean Harlow, and Spencer Tracy. Johnson and Williams are too bland in the lead roles. Lucy provides a few chuckles; upon learning that Johnson may be married to two women, she says, "That's arson." The funniest scene has her getting drunk with Johnson. Williams gets a dip in the pool but the musical numbers are not memorable and probably contribute to the lethargic pacing. By comparison, the original zipped along at a rapid pace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of Libled Lady Fizzles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has its plusses -- Esthers swimming, her swimming, and her swimming. It's also in technicolor, which is always a treat to the eye. It really surprised me that a socco screenplay that made 1936's Libled Lady such a rip-roaring funny film could go so flat 10 years later. Of course Myrna Loy, Jean Harlow, William Powell, and Spencer Tracy were more highly skilled performers than this cast. Williams has some to the stoic, amused calm that Loy had and she does okay as Connie, but Lucille Ball is almost unfunny in this, which really surprised me. She lacks Harlows warmth and vulnerability and timing. Harlow really carried Libled Lady and one always looks forward to her scenes. Ball is too arch and steely here. It puts a damper on the films success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Road Company Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Easy To Wed had an impossible task to follow the film and stars of one of the best screen comedies ever made Libeled Lady. I would take nothing away from Van Johnson, Esther Williams, Lucille Ball, and Keenan Wynn. But frankly they're all not a patch on the quartet of William Powell, Myrna Loy, Jean Harlow, and Spencer Tracy. Music and MGM technicolor is what distinguishes this film and the music primarily Latin in origin is pretty good and comes from a variety of sources. Colombian singer Carlos Ramirez contributes a native song and Ethel Smith plays her famous Tico Tico on the organ. Part of the film is set in Mexico so these acts are brought in without any strain on the plot. When the stars do their numbers, the results are pretty tepid.Esther Williams stays fairly dry in Easy To Wed. Only a dip on a water slide and a brief swim in the family pool where she unplugs a rubber raft and sends Van Johnson into the water are all you see of her. No classic water ballets in Easy To Wed which must have disappointed her fans tremendously.In Libeled Lady the character Loy/Williams's father is played by Walter Connolly and he's an avid fisherman. Here he's a hunter and Van Johnson has to take a crash course in duck hunting to make an impression on father Cecil Kellaway. Van's best moments like William Powell's in the first film are in the hunting scenes. The basic outline of the story remains the same. A false story about heiress Esther Williams's romantic escapades has caused a lawsuit to be filed by Cecil Kellaway. Editor Keenan Wynn postpones for the umpteenth time his wedding to Lucille Ball to meet the crisis at the paper. Wynn's plan, to hire back his ace reporter Van Johnson and marry his girl friend Ball to Johnson and then have Johnson strike something up with Williams. Just as Jean Harlow did, Lucille Ball amazingly enough goes along with this madcap scheme. Everybody performs well, but after you've seen Libeled Lady you will think of Easy To Wed as a road company version of that classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take It Easy with Esther, Van, Keenan, and Lucy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Easy to Wed" is a remake of "Libeled Lady," with Spencer Tracy, Jean Harlow, William Powell, and Myrna Loy. You don't have to know that. But, it helps to know that, when one is wondering why this Esther Williams movie doesn't make Esther center stage. As a matter of fact, despite the lead actor of Van Johnson, this breezy comedy, which is pleasant enough, but rather long, relies on Keenan Wynn and Lucille Ball to keep the ball rolling. They are the ones throwing their weight around. Esther Williams looks great as usual, but Lucy's not-so-soft-spoken character and constant wardrobe changes into flowing and colorful outfits outdoes her, as Esther quietly looks on. And, as much as I like Van Johnson, he's not given much to do and for that matter he seems a bit disinterested. The plot revolves around getting a libel suit against a newspaper dropped. Actually, the best part comes after Esther finally warms up to Van and even Lucy is spellbound by his charms. This is not Esther at her wettest, and this is no classic, like the original. So enjoy and don't expect too much; just sit back and take it easy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy to Wed is Sometimes Hard to Digest **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lucille Ball steals the film in a supporting role. She displays some of the many antics she would use in her famous television show- "I Love Lucy," some 5 years after this film was made.In some ways, Lucy reminded me on Lina Lamont, without the crazy voice, in "Singin'in the Rain," (1952).The film has a funny premise when heiress Esther Williams wants to sue a newspaper for defaming her, and reporter Keenan Wynn "hires" his fiancée Lucy to romance and even wed fellow reporter Van Johnson so that Johnson can in turn carry on with Williams and embarrass her to the extent that she will drop the suit. Keenan Wynn is his usual testy, acerbic self.As the wealthy farmer, veteran actor Cecil Kellaway is definitely miscast here. You needed someone such as Edward Arnold.As good as Ball is here, I could have also envisioned Eve Arden for the part, especially with the wisecracks and sarcasm needed for the role.The film gets sidetracked somewhat by the duck shooting scene and the ending might be what you suspect, but isn't 100% satisfying. It's somewhat incomplete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another libeled lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film, Libeled Lady, was carefully tailored to suit the talents of its stars, William Powell, Jean Harlow, Myrna Loy, and Spencer Tracy. It's not easy to take such a star vehicle, and, without significant alterations, make it into a vehicle for four very different stars. I guess I thought the alterations weren't significant enough. I'd rather see Van Johnson shine in his own kind of role than try to fill the shoes of William Powell, for example. Johnson is about as successful playing a Powell part as Powell would be in Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. Even if, on the surface, things have been spruced up to make it seem like a Johnson part, it really isn't. Only Lucille Ball succeeded in making me forget the original film when she was on the screen. Harlow was great, but Lucy is also great, in a completely different way. When she's on the screen it's hard to think of anyone else ever having played the role.This film seems to have been intended for black and white but switched to color at the last minute. The sets are painted and dressed for black and white - in muted tones of gray, brown, beige, dull green, etc. - throughout the film. The costumes are close to colorless a lot of the time. Brown and gray predominate. Not even a colorful necktie. Even in the musical numbers at the end, the sets are mostly white and gray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining musical romance Technicolor remake of classic '30s nonmusical screwball romantic comedy: Libeled Lady.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike many reviewers, I haven't seen the '36 "Libeled Lady", except for a preview, to which the present film is commonly unfavorably compared. Movie studios of the late '40s and '50s chose to redo some popular films of the late '20s and '30s, usually in color, contrasting with the B&amp;W of the original, sometimes converting a pure comedy or drama into a musical, or completely redoing the music, and often making substantial alterations of the screenplay. In the present case, apparently, relatively few alterations of the screenplay were made. However, duck shooting, rather than fishing, is scripted as the hobby of the debutante's father, and thus the skill that Bill Chandler(Van Johnson) feels he must pretend he knows about and quickly learn the basics about, in order to facilitate getting his foot in the door of presenting himself as a desirable romantic partner for his debutante daughter(Esther Williams). I won't bother reviewing the screenplay in much detail, as this has been done enough. I will note that, with the exception of the Lucy-Jean Harlow comparison, the main character actors in this film are all approximately 5 years younger than their counterparts in the '36 film, and thus they seem like a younger bunch, more appropriately single. Even Lucy seems younger than Jean, although she was considerably older.Van and Esther were very popular, separately or together, with film audiences during the mid-'40s to mid-'50s period. Van had the vaudevillian skills of light comedy, song and dance, as well as being suitable for serious roles, such as in "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo". Esther came across as an ideal 'all-American' girl, most famous for her water ballets, but also with decent talent as an actress, sometimes singing a song or two. Too often, she was portrayed by others as being a poor actress, only of interest to audiences in swimming pools. Here, her performance is commonly very unfavorably compared to that of her costar: Lucille Ball, and predecessor, Myna Loy. Well, Lucy, long time costar of mostly 'B' films , for various studies, was rightly cast as a dizzy showgirl, who is swept up into the complicated romantic plot of a temporary shotgun marriage-of-convenience to a man she initially labels as a baboon or ape(hardly an apt description of handsome, mild-mannered, blond, Van!). She gets to lead a chorus in the stage song and dance number "The Continental Polka", which serves as Van's chance to initially evaluate her, as a prospective temporary 'wife', in order to create a scandal when he hopefully attracts the amorous attention of socialite Connie(Esther), in order to induce her father to drop a libel charge against the newspaper his friend Warren(Keenan Wynn) works for. Lucy is given a rare opportunity during her Hollywood period to display repeated scenes of zaniness, rather like those characteristic of Betty Hutton or Martha Raye, for example, and she well succeeds in them. In contrast, Esther's character is supposed to be snobbish man bait, who routinely turns down proposals. Initially, she sees Van as just another wannabe gold digger. But, she's eventually impressed with his persistence, imagination, and winning boyish personality, and lowers her guard. Her humor is more subtle than Lucy's, but appropriate for her character. Van displays his gift for parlor dialogue, comedy(especially relating to duck shooting),and a couple of musical numbers with Esther, as part of a stage production in one case.Columbian singing sensation, Carlos Ramirez, contracted to MGM during the mid-40s, solos one song, as part of a Mexican floor show, later privately reprised by Esther and Van. Near the end, is an impressive dance production, again with Latin American costumes and music, and including Esther and Van, in a portion. Ethel Smith is also on hand to entertain with her famous jazzy organ music, during the two Latin-themed productions. Both she and Carlos had been included, more prominently, in Esther's first water-themed film: "Bathing Beauty".I don't understand why Van's character has the parson sign the marriage certificate, instead of the agreed upon detail that he doesn't sign it, thus rendering Van's marriage -of-convenience to Lucy's character not legally binding. Thus, in the ending, when Van's and Esther's characters want to get married, they have to dig up the detail that Lucy's supposed divorce from her previous husband wasn't legal, thus also was her unconsummated marriage to Van's character. But Lucy spoils the apparently happy ending by revealing that she subsequently obtained a legal divorce, not included in the records Van checked, thus apparently invalidating the just legalized marriage of Van's and Esther's characters. Lucy gives quite an impressive speech about her feelings about the matrimonial mess. The film ends with this marriage-go-round still unresolved, unclear whether Lucy's character can be induced to cooperate, even with possible monetary reward, in dissolving her sham marriage to Van's character, and perhaps agreeing to a marriage with Keenan Wynn's character, as the others wish, and was her original intention.Van had costarred with Esther the previous year in the very popular "Thrill of a Romance", and would later costar with her in "Duchess of Idaho", and "Easy to Love", by which time noted baritone Howard Keel was also a frequent costar. Most of her films we would classify as minor musicals, in which very few of the songs were intended to become standards. Although many of Esther's films included a water ballet or two, in place of dance productions, some, including this one didn't(It had a dance production, instead). However, she does manage an impressive underwater clinch and kiss with Van!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acceptable, if unnecessary, remake of "Libled Lady" with a fabulous comic redhead to recommend it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the hey-day of Hollywood, remakes came fast and furious, but most of the great screwball comedies weren't touched for 20 years. MGM obviously couldn't wait and remade one of its best only 10 years after the original. There is no topping the original cast of this tale, and the replacements point out the B category this fell into, even on an A budget. As charming as Esther Williams is, she can't compare to Myrna Loy, and Van Johnson and Keenan Wynn are as far down the totem pole from William Powell and Spencer Tracy as they can be. The real delight is that Lucille Ball can't miss here in the Jean Harlow part, showing off her flaming red hair here in Technicolor. Only Lucy could get away with accusing someone of arson, meaning bigamy.The musical numbers seem pretty superfluous, with Lucy utilizing her hips to literally blow the hats off the chorus boys without even touching them, in one number. Organist Ethel Smith heats things up, even banging on conga drums in another. Ms. Williams pretty much avoids the water, although a funny duck hunting scene with her, papa Cecil Kellaway and Johnson (altered from the original hysterical fishing sequence) is set on a river. The presence of the annoying socialite and her dizzy daughter seems out of place here. This isn't for purists but isn't a dud, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After "The Morning Star" prints a gossipy item on beautiful socialite Esther Williams (as Connie Allenbury), she decides to sue the paper for $2,000,000 in libel damages. Their business manager Keenan Wynn (as Warren Haggerty) interrupts his impending wedding to brassy redhead Lucille Ball (as Gladys Benton) to work on countering Ms. Williams' suit. Mr. Wynn hires writer Van Johnson (as Bill Chandler) to battle Williams. He plots to have Mr. Johnson marry Ms. Ball, then pursue Williams. The men hope to create an actual scandal between Williams and a married man, then get her to drop the lawsuit...The script has Johnson asks for a green dress, but he gets blue...This is a re-make of "Libeled Lady" (1936) with the addition of musical and swimming sequences. While pleasant, they add nothing to the story. The four lead performers are not individually unsatisfying and are okay in pairs (Johnson with either Williams or Ball), but the quartet doesn't mix well. Most outstanding is the "Technicolor" photography (Harry Stradling) and costumes (Irene Lentz). Lucy is terrific at the piano when Johnson is practicing his "duck calls" before a date with Williams. Lucy got the last laugh when she made it much funnier on her TV series episode "Lucy Goes Duck Hunting" (1963).****** Easy to Wed (7/11/46) Edward Buzzell ~ Van Johnson, Lucille Ball, Esther Williams, Keenan Wynn</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Treat for the Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'll try to summarize the storyline. If Homer can prove Connie's a man stealer he'll escape a 2-million dollar lawsuit. So he hires Bill to catch Connie's eye. But Gladys is married to Bill or is it to Warren. Then again, maybe she isn't. But then Bill marries Connie, but Bill's already married or maybe he isn't since no one knows who's divorced whom. Anyway, I give up because the plot's not important, anyhow.The movie's a visual treat, what with Williams, Johnson, and Ball being at their physical peak. I doubt there were three more beautiful people in Hollywood, especially Williams in a swimsuit. Then too, there's MGM's renowned production values lending the results a Technicolor sheen that makes you want to jump in. And is that really Fidel Castro at poolside (IMDB)! Now with all the physical assets, this musical comedy should be strictly memorable. But unfortunately it's not; as a mc the overall results are entertaining but only average. Director Buzzell fails to give many of the scenes the bounce they need, while the script has too many stretched-out, talky scenes. Together, we see pretty people in pretty places doing sometimes funny things (especially Ball), but without the needed zip, plus a storyline that defies analysis.Well, that's pretty much the case except for Ball, who shows (surprise, surprise) a lively flair for adding her own comedic bounce. And, if I remember correctly, this was one of her first comedic outings in what, of course, would become a legendary career. And get a load of the array of hats she gets to wear. Some look like they were taken off the New York skyline. Still, that combination of fiery red hair and deep blue eyes is absolutely dazzling. Anyway, this is the glamour studio MGM at its most glamorous and if the results are less than hoped, the movie's still a visual feast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nonsensical remake of 1936's "Libeled Lady" casts Esther Williams as a beautiful but arrogant heiress who sues a publication for two million dollars after they print a would-be scandalous story. The newspaper gets revenge by matching the socialite up with a suave womanizer--not expecting true love to blossom. Tepid shenanigans does get Williams into the water, albeit briefly; much of this comedy is spent on fast-talking wisecracks delivered at a high decibel level. Unfortunately, louder doesn't equal funnier, and some good players flounder (particularly titian-haired Lucille Ball, in one of her weakest performances). Organist Ethel Smith has a fun bit (joined by a Spanish-singing Williams and Van Johnson!), and the film is certainly well-dressed, but the comedic timing is unpolished and the plot is insufferable. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable enough but it cannot hold a candle to the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Libeled Lady" is one of the best comedies of the 1930s. Much of was the writing and much was due to the incredibly strong cast. Think about it---Spencer Tracy, Myrna Loy, Jean Harlow and William Powell--ALL in one film! In 1946, MGM brought out a remake. While the basic story is similar, it's not as good. Plus, Esther Williams, Van Johnson, Keenan Wynn and Lucille Ball just weren't as good--though they tried.Like "Libeled Lady", the film is about a rich lady who is suing an irresponsible newspaper for its stories about her. However, oddly, in the original she was suing for $5,000,000 and here, a decade later, it's only $2,000,000--significant deflation, don't you think? To help try to get rid of the suit, the scheming newspaper man, Haggerty (Wynn), hires Bill Chandler (Van Johnson) to seduce the heiress, Connie Allenbury (Williams). Why? Because, in the interim, they'd get Bill a quickie marriage. Then, they'd have the 'jealous wife' storm in on them and threaten a suit of her own--along with photographers from the paper to make her case! But, since Bill isn't married, Haggerty has Chandler marry HIS fiancée (Lucille Ball)! Talk about romantic--getting Chandler to marry Haggerty's girl! There's only one problem with the plan...Bill falls for Connie and just can't get himself to do it. So, he schemes for a way to somehow please Haggerty AND Connie...if it's possible.The film is decent and offers a few laughs. However it suffers from a few plot problems (Connie's falling in love with Bill seems incredibly fast considering how nasty she'd been towards him up until then), now includes song which got in the way of the plot and the characters aren't particularly likable (Connie is amazingly nasty--and for no reason--when she first meets Bill). Plus, it lacks the originality and fun of the first film. If you like remakes, by all means see this one. But, don't forget to first see "Libeled Lady"--it's just better.By the way, the plot of "Easy to Wed" is very, very odd considering only about six months later, Keenan Wynn and his real-life wife divorced....so she could marry Van Johnson! To make it even weirder, it now appears that this, like the marriage in the movie, was a sham marriage, as in his later years Johnson admitted to being gay--and I sincerely doubt that this was a sudden late-life 'phase'!</fullReview>
