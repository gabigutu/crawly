		<shortDescription>A very dear film to my gory, blood-filled heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the splatter anticlassic all us sickos know and love. The non-plot is, well, pretty simple and it's only an excuse to cut loose with loads of very extreme gore and sadism. Fuad Ramses (Mal Arnold), an Egyptian maniac of pagan bloodlust, must serve up a "blood feast" to Ishtar, his horrible goddess of gory days gone by. Y'know, back when chicks used to get their hearts yanked out on altars IN BLOOD COLOR! How does he get the morsels for his feast? It's an easy guess! Tongues pulled out. Limbs cut off. Brains hacked out in a blood-splattered mess. It's the grand-daddy of all the sickest stuff you've ever seen, and even though it's pretty stupid and bad, it sure is fun! It's even funny on purpose (as well as the other way around). For those of you who dig this unsavory and depraved type of junk the way I do, find this bad mother as soon as possible and surrender to the forbidden pleasures of the first splatter-comedy ever! (I think...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Check out this ancient Egyption feast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oft-credited as the first traditional "gore" pic, 'Blood Feast' establishes all of typical conventions of the genre; including nubile, young women (including a Playboy Playmate), excessive blood and guts, and even some dark humor (including the "hamburger" line and the trash-compactor ending). It's also inept in every way, from the atrocious acting and horrible directing to the dumb-as-dirt characters. Hell, the most intelligent character in this movie is the murderer, Faud Ramses - what, with him having penned a seemingly popular non-fiction work and running a bang-up catering business to boot - and even he is not too bright, which unfortunately catches up with him in the end.If you love bad movies in that MST3K kind of way, than this is one to see. It's laugh-a-minute riot (and you've go to love the score). So put down that copy of 'Ancient Weird Religious Rites' and check this movie out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a technical standpoint, this movie is awful. But, you still have to give credit to Lewis and Friedman for creating a new genre of film; the splatter flick. For this reason, and probably this reason alone, I rate it at 6. Well, you have to give Lewis credit for the musical score that he did himself. The electric organ and opening shot of the Sphinx is hilarious. The writing and acting, though, are deplorable.This is an exploitation movie in the mold of the circus sideshow. The ad campaign for the movie made it appear to be more than it really was. In fact, a "nurse" was on hand at showings to assist those who might become overwhelmed by the horror presented on the screen. Many of the scenes, like the one with the woman's tongue being ripped out of her mouth (from what I understand, it was a sheep's tongue purchased from a local butcher)are quite revolting and unsettling. Actually, this is a part of what is known as the Blood Trilogy along with Lewis' better made, Two Thousand Maniacs. The third film is Color Me Blood Red.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Veritable Feast For the Eyes....of sorts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blood Feast by H. G. Lewis was the first splatter film ever made, and it changed the path of the horror film forever. Its importance, whether good or bad, is undeniable. The film is in many ways the very essence of amateurishness. I do not believe I have ever seen a film where no one...and I mean no one...had ANY acting ability. For me, the only one that comes closest is Mal Arnold as the Egyptian caterer Fuad Ramses. These people cannot laugh, cry, scream, or even speak with any degree of credibility at all. I mean you would have to train people to get results like this if you had wanted them to be like this in the first place. I can only think that maybe with the leads being so poor...the other actors had no inspiration. The direction is not a great deal better...but then the film was made in 9 days. The script is silly and filled with lamentable dialogue where every facet of the plot must be explained and re-explained. What then does this "classic" have going for it? Well, it is fun to watch. It will make you laugh at its unreal gore and its poor acting and direction. The gore is a given and it is abundant....bright red dapples and drapes the bodices of many victimized girls...all of which I might point out are very easy on the eyes...another plus for male viewers. The music, created by Lewis, is surprisingly very good and stylish, helping create the mood and pacing of the film. All in all, I recommend seeing Blood Feast for its ineptitude and the laughs it will derive. If you are a fan of horror, it is a must see to satisfy your curiosity of what caused the change from good horror stories to graphic horror films. The answer lies with Blood Feast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some day, I hope to travel to Clearwater, Florida, to place a manikin leg before the Sphinx in the patking lot, in honor of this classic of trash cinema which was filmed there. This is the one film I can think of that succeeds brilliantly in every frame to be deeply entertaining because it's so profoundly inept. Though I have, on repeated viewing, developed a special fondness for Mal Arnold's interpretation of Fuad Ramses. It's the essence of camp. He might have been a neighbor on Pee-Wee's Playhouse! Has anyone else noticed the perverse giddiness of the scenes where he fondles womens' entrails? There's a cut-rate irony at work here, too. The only things happening in this town are Suzette Fremont's party and those horrible murders. Yet only we, the audience, know that they're related. And what about that book club? Do they only offer one title?Also, the tongue-pulling scene had to be the first occurance of slapstick gore. I mean, he didn't knock her out or anything. He just jammed his fingers into her mouth as soon as she opened the door. And she didn't particularly struggle with him. She just went "Ngaahhh!" and "Lleeehhh," as he yanked. And when he got the tongue out, it was about a foot long. Did it get stretched out of shape like taffy?For a movie to be that entertaining to me every time I've watched it (which must be more than fifty by now)represents some weird kind of accomplishment. Do yourself a favor and buy the DVD. This is perhaps the best unintentional comedy ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>anyone who views themselves as a serious horror fan should praise HG Lewis as GOD!!! although his movies are dated and somewhat cheesy by todays jaded standpoint, without his contributions, the horror genre would not be what it is today. this film is the first of the revolutionary (for their time...) "trilogy of blood", which were among the first films ever to show graphic depictions of bondage,blood, mutilation and all things near and dear to true horror fans hearts. obviously upon current viewing of the film, the gore effects will seem amateurish and silly, but you have to remember, this film was made in 1963. NO ONE was making films like this back then and we can all thank Mr. Lewis for his contributions, because without them, horror would not be what it is today. 8 1/2 out of 10 for the genre also see "The GORE GORE GIRLS" (aka BLOOD ORGY) - in my opinion the best (and goriest Lewis film)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My rating is a kind of anti-rating. Is this a fine film? No. Is the plot compelling? No. Are the actors top-notch emoters? No, no, and thrice no. Are the gore effects convincing? Absolutely not! Is the film a work of sheer visionary genius? Yes! Sort of, in an alternative film-making universe kind of way. Fuad Ramses is one of the greatest/most bizarre cinematic creations I have had the pleasure of seeing. His logic is fantastic, and if for nothing else, he deserves kudos for outrunning a number of fully-fit police officers, and him with a conspicuous (read sinister) limp! Ramses' enunciation of his lines is brilliant and I am now searching for an opportunity to slide "a feast...last...given...five...thousand...years...ago" into an everyday conversation. Add not very bright police officers, one of whom is clearly Basil Exposition's father, and a series of splendid (and ground-breaking, it must be said) gore set-pieces, and you have genius. So, let us all raise a glass to Mr. Lewis and proclaim Blood Feast as the warped work of art it most surely is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically inept but highly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herschell Gordon Lewis's pioneering 'gore' movie is one of those films, like 'Plan 9 From Outer Space', which is entertaining due to its sheer ineptitude. Almost everything that could go wrong, does go wrong. The acting ranges ranges from ridiculously over-the-top (Mal Arnold) to so wooden it makes the furniture look animated (Lyn Bolton and Playboy Playmate Connie Mason). The music is truly appalling, including hilariously misjudged musical 'stings' and out-of-tune strings. The editing, especially in the opening scene, is some of the worst you will ever see. The story is little more than an excuse to show a lot of very bloody (but also very unconvincing) gore. However, the film has plenty of unintentional laughs and is more enjoyable than much of the slick, soulless Hollywood 'product' that gets churned out at an alarming rate each year. A must for all lovers of Z-Grade exploitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Herschell is maybe my favorite gore director. The person who invented genres off handedly, does it again - for the first time! Wonderful colors, very disturbing plot. John Waters used to watch these films as a young man. One could see Herschell's effect on Waters later films like 'Pink Flamingos' when you look at Herschells colors (color me blood red) and the trashy- campy acting, costumes and settings. When I think of flesh Water's star Divine - i have to admit - Waters saved some of that gore effect that Herschell has in his films. The effect of real fleshy gore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploitation of the finest caliber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herschell Gordon Lewis' cautionary tale of wanting to be too cultured. Ramses, a shop owner with disturbingly large eyebrows, offers clueless white people a taste of old world Egypt in what is called a blood feast. This turns out to be a cannibalistic ritual needed to resurrect an ancient Egyptian deity. This movie gives you everything you'd expect and more. While using an over abundance of fake syrupy blood, shaking camera effects and plenty of severed body parts, it seems more bizarre than gorey. It does feature plenty of terrible single shot dialogue and a sparse single instrument score. This is the exploitation film that makes you love exploitation films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.g Lewis a Master at doing low budget gore films like Two Thousand Mainacs (Remade has 2001 Maniacs starring Robert Englund) the Gore-Gore Girls etc. Blood Feast was his first gore movie and it's very low budget but it's great fun, the effects are cheesy but effective like the tongue scene. The acting is alright but it's not great like some other low budget movies but I don't mind, the film sees a Egyption Cateer being requested to prepare food for a women's daughter's birthday, he then goes around killing young women then cutting off certain body parts for a dormant Egyption Goddess. The Cops have no idea what this killer looks like but they've put warnings on the streets, Detective Pete is going out with the Daughter who's having the party and doesn't realise that he doesn't do something his girlfriend will also he killed for the Blood Feast, he must try and catch this killer before he kills and cooks anyone else.Blood Feast is a classic gory flick that should be seen. Check this out. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Gore Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie proudly took the tile as the first gore movie. Although the acting is terrible, and one of the characters look as if he is reading something as he speaks, (perhaps his script?), this movie has what you can find in a typical gore movie.I could find myself feeling nauseated throughout the movie, but yes, even the greatest of gore and horror fans can find that happening to them. I have to wait until 7 AM when the sun goes up to fall asleep because it was so frightening! A caterer cuts off body parts from young girls in order to bring to an Egyptian god named Ishtar. He hyptnonises the mother to use the body parts or what he called it "Egyptian Feast" in her daughter's party to serve to the guests. When he comes to the party, he attempts to trick the mother's daughter to lie down and close her eyes tightly while he is holding a knife. As he is about to stab her, her mother walks in and the man quickly escapes. The police arrives and chases him on foot. He is later on crushed in a truck.. like the scum he was.I recommend this movie if you would want to see the movie heralded to be the first "gore" movie, or if you like to watch movies of that genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Herschell Gordon Lewis. He's one of my favorite directors of all time. Now, I would definetly not want to follow any directing techniques he uses because his direction is awful. However, it is his ambition that I most admire. Blood Feast is the lowest of low budget films with campy dialogue, tons of fake gore, and acting that is beyond amateurish. But this is one horror movie I watch with a huge smile stretched across my face throughout the entire picture. Not because of it's outrageous campiness but because it is just so enjoyable.I love Lewis for the fact that he dished out these movies in a matter of weeks and they all made tons of money! It was his ambition and love of the new found splatter genre that kept him going and going. I believe he made, what, 6 movies in 1967? Don't see Blood Feast if you want to see award winning material. Don't even see it if you are in the mood to laugh at a horror film. See it because Lewis is a true innovator and is one to be admired, no matter how bad his films are.*****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece from the Ed Wood of Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the first-ever splatter epic, "Blood Feast" is assured of its place in history. This low-budget shlockfest is single-handedly responsible for launching an entire genre of films, including slasher fare like the Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street movies. For that reason, its place in hell is probably assured, too. Though to be fair, of course, we can thank it for so many other blood-soaked cinematic excursions that are actually entertaining.And fortunately for cheese heads, director Herschell Gordon Lewis, the "Godfather of Gore," is also the Ed Wood of gore. The two great auteurs share many important trademarks in their roster of masterpieces, including wooden acting, absurdly bad dialogue, cheeseball effects, and lousy continuity. "Blood Feast" sports all of these endearing qualities and more, even going so far as to include some Woodian abrupt day-to-night-to-day transitions.The dopey plot involves one Fuad Ramses, author of the New York Times bestseller "Ancient Weird Religious Practices," and his attempt to re-create, through his ridiculous "exotic catering" service, an authentic Egyptian blood feast, whatever that is. But really, all we need to know is that it involves the gruesome murders of pretty young women. (Surprise, surprise, surprise!) Beyond that, all that's left to say is that the Good Doctor gives this landmark bit of trash cinema two wheels of gorgonzola up.Followed, insanely, by a sequel in 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is where it all started. And it's also the first of what's known as Herschell Gordon Lewis' "blood trilogy" of gorefests. Yeah the acting's terrible. Yes, the special effects are awful and yeah, it looks like it was filmed on a shoestring budget, but that's what makes this thing so great! (laughs)A series of young women are slaughtered in Miami by a local crackpot named Faud Ramses (Mal Arnold). He only takes one part of the woman's body each time by cutting off a leg or a heart or using a machete and cutting out a woman's brains on a dark Miami beach and leaves the local police (led by Bill Kerwin) baffled and clueless.Ramses is also the local, exotic caterer who uses these woman's body parts to serve his customers without them knowing about it. And that includes a party thrown by Kerwin's girlfriend's (played by 1963 Playboy Playmate, Connie Mason) mother. Connie looks better here than she later did in TWO THOUSAND MANIACS. The Something Weird DVD uses a crisp master print taken from the original negative. It's real clean without any scratches or damage. The sound is as good as can be expected from the original mono source. It also has 45 minutes of rare outtakes that that are almost as interesting as the film itself with topless scenes that weren't shown in the film. It also includes a short industrial film starring Kerwin and Harvey Korman (yes, that Harvey Korman) called "Carving Magic" that was done around the same time as this film. We learn the fine art of 'meat' carving so I guess it's supposed to tie into the irony of this film, right?This is camp as it's best, folks. (laughs)7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BLOOD FEAST IS HG Lewis' first gore movie and even though there are some memorable scenes of gore, the film itself was very bad. Many sets looked like they were shot on a community theatre stage. The camera was often set in one position and didn't move at all. The dialogue and acting were abysmal. The music was bizarre. It's a contender of sorts for one of the worst films ever. There's a scene where a guy cries after his girlfriend was killed on the beach. That is THE worst acting ever caught on film. Amazingly bad and hilarious. But the gore is still at times disturbing and I guess that's what gorehounds look for in these kind of movies. 2000 MANIACS is much better than this.</fullReview>

The acting is just terrible, I mean it's astronomically poor. The cops in this movie are incredibly slow, they must be on the lower end of the bell curve. The music is incredibly cheesy and campy too. The special effects are not very good either, some shots only show the aftermath of somebody dying. The blood looks very fake and so does the flesh in the movie. The ending is hysterically dumb. Overall, it's an enjoyable experience and very unintentionally funny. A very campy gory movie which won't appeal to a lot of people but if you can dumb down for an hour then you'll love it. I couldn't give it a 10 because it's so bad, but again it's so bad its good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will try to breakdown each component: Plot: the plot is a restaurant owner uses people to perform an ancient feast (blood Feast). Basically it is an excuse to show teenage girls being killed and tortured.Acting: the acting ranges from completely cartooney (Fuad Ramses) to extremely boring (everybody else). Just flat out horrible acting.Score: A fourth grader playing the bassoon is better. It literally hurts yournears after a while.Blood Effects: The redest, fakest and most hilarious looking blood ever put on screen. And there is a lot of it.All there things add up just right for the magical experience known as Blood Feast. The film was released in 1963 and is directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis. It is considered the first explicitly graphic display of violence. It is flat out awesome and a real joy to watch. I also recommend the "sequals" 2000 Maniacs and Color Me Blood Red.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tenderness invades my heart when I think about this movie. Why? Because I think of an old grumpy man sitting on a rocking chair, holding a Jack Daniel's bottle and a gun. Still, he looks like a very interesting man that will tell about ancient horror in all the sense of the word.This movie as everyone points out, is the Godfather of gore. But it's relevance reaches higher peaks. I mean, it introduced the horror cinema audience the perfect complement for the genre and that is blood in all of it's glorious expression and sometimes when needed, exaggerated in amounts.The film is brutal in substance but somewhat cheap in execution. The production values are inept and tend to rely on incoherence, but at least it's shown that H.G. Lewis tried too hard in order to create a horrific visual experience. I mean, some movies are cheap and don't even try to create a quality product. "Blood Feast" tried hard and I can easily ignore the technical incompetence.Mal Arnold is the only actor who can act and truly delivers a psychotic performance. Those intense eyes and his powerful eyebrow! The worst actor I've seen in a while is that infamous guy who portrayed Tony. He couldn't act, laugh, scream, etc.The deaths are brutal although not very disturbing for today's standards. We got nice eye gouging, stabbings, ripped hearts and tongues, and a glorious ending that deals with a garbage truck."Blood Feast" broke many taboos that only Hitchcock's "Psycho" was brave enough to try. H.G. Lewis introduced nudity, extreme gore, brutal violence, naughty situations, and the infamous killer on the hunt situation that would fright anyone because his killers always commit murders that are sex oriented. So that means nobody's safe, and when blood is abundant, well, you know what to expect! This movie has a special place in my heart and I truly believe it deserves a lot more recognition. Yes, you like it or not but it's in the same league as "Psycho", "Exorcist", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and it's the grandfather of "Evil Dead" and these new "Hostal" and "Saw" things.I'd literally kill to watch it on drive-ins!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the context of film school, film theory, film conventions and anything about film-making that makes it a poignant and artful form of expression, this is a big "DON'T". Anything that can be done poorly, has already been done. Yet what we are left with is a prototypical piece of celluloid. The director, Herschell Gordon Lewis, can easily be seen as love child of Russ Meyer and Ed Wood. Those two names both evoke dread and hilarity. One can only imagine what a movie that has both would be like. Well thankfully for Herschell Gordon Lewis, the world soon found out.As with most of his movies, forget the story. It is usually a patchwork of closeups, zoom outs, shaky cam, fake gore, nonsensical dialog driven vignettes (with sadomasochistic and other sexual undertones), coming together in the framework of 60 minutes. There's a serial killer around killing young women and removing certain organs or appendages. At the same time there is a deli owner who caters a special ancient Egyptian feast. The rest is just nonsensical, droll dialog delivered with monotony and the ending. The ending is just painful. I recommend running around blindfolded at full speed in a city, as a way to simulate the end of the movie. If I am making this seem bad, I can digress by listing more evidence of this :Exhibit 1 : Multiple minute scene of a character making a phone call and then conversing with that person. We never hear or see the person on the other end.Exhibit 2 : Profile close ups of two people talking. Multiple instances too numerous to count.Exhibit 3 : Echo, echo, echo ..... Exhibit 4 : Try to hire someone who's last job wasn't as a silent movie pianist, in 1919. It sounded like old heroin-hooked Bela Lugosi having fun with a church organ.Exhibit 5 : Police that store their firearms in their back pockets (along with their wallets, most likely) and continue to mispronounce homicide (pronounced home_e-side).Exhibit 6 : Horrible acting in vivid, bright Cinemascope.Exhibit 7 : An intermission half way through the movie, where a Richard Nixon look alike is giving a lecture on ancient Egypt.Exhibit 8 : The longest and slowest getaway and chase scene by a man from the Ministry of Funny Walks.Exhibit 9 : Dialog such as : "Well the killer must have thought she was dead. It was a miracle she wasn't.""Well she is now."".... yeah."Based on all my evidence so far, you either : a) think I hate this movie. b) know I hate this movie. c) stopped reading 15 minutes ago. d) are confused. e) none of the above.To answer all but e, I do like this movie. This movie is closer to Russ Meyer's than Ed Wood. Ed lounged in his mediocre low-budget fetish. Russ mostly portrayed sex as a good, fun thing (his movies do have an unusual depth to them). Herschell took Ed's knack for making SOMETHING with limited funds and added the sexually explicit and completely gratuitous scenes. Just in case we weren't gorged enough on our own endorphins, he adds the gore/horror element. The funny thing is that none of it works. The ridiculousness of the movie is in itself. An advantage is the short running time. By the time you realize you are still watching, is the same point you realize it will just end. I can easily see a starving early 30 year old William Shatner finding an artistic mentor after watching this on a lazy Saturday afternoon double feature. So join in. Drop into the couch and pour yourself a fresh one. We're gonna be here for a little while. Kanpai !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blood Feast has always had my vote! The first "Gore" film ever made was directed by Hershell Gordan Lewis, who later went on to direct many films like this including "2000 Maniacs", "Wizard of Gore", "Blood Feast 2", etc.Blood Feast is a rather silly movie by todays standards but when this came out, it was considered shocking and demoralizing. The storyline is of a man named Fuod Ramses who is a caterer. When asked by a nice lady to cater her daughters wedding, Fuod excepts and offers to make it an Egyption Feast. What the kindly woman dosen't expect is that this feast is made of cooked womens body parts! So, Fuod goes on a gruesome rampage to retrieve the parts for the feast.Hahaha, I love this movie. The storyline is so silly and hard to take seriously it makes for great entertainment. The first time I had ever heard of this movie was when I went to the theaters to see the John Waters film "Serial Mom". In the movie, Kathleen Turners son is watching the scene in which a young woman gets her tongue torn out. I love HG Lewis films and hope to see a "Blood Feast 3" directed by him. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst (and therefore one of the best) movies I have ever seen. I've heard about this movie since I was a kid and never have been able to find a copy of it until recently. I was lucky enough to stumble upon a DVD of this film and practically RAN to the cashier with my money waving over my head in excitement. I've heard of director Herschell Gordon Lewis, and how gory and awful some of his films were. Here was my chance to see for myself. The plot is simple: A woman hires a caterer to supply dinner for a party. As it turns out our caterer, Fuad Ramses, is a crazed killer in the business of hacking apart young women to appease his god, Ishtar. Lewis wastes no time to shock the audience with a bloody beginning. Remember, this is 1963. The gore in this film is nothing more than you can see watching CSI. But at the time, it must have been a real stomach-turner. I loved the super-low production value of this film. I think it actually added to the overall style. We're not here for character development, remember. The acting is absolutely pathetic. There's a scene where the chief of police is actually reading his lines off the palm of his hand! It's great! I laughed out loud a few times at the unintentional humor throughout the film. There's a scene, again involving the police chief, poor guy, who appears in a scene wearing a hat, walks inside a room, and the hat's gone. He walks into another room and the hat's back on. But believe it or not, this is exactly what I was expecting...and I loved it! The film lived up to every expectation I had. Bad acting. Bad dialogue. The gore is unconvincing at best, but at the same time it is gross. I've watched this movie three times now, and liked it more each time. If you're lucky enough to get the DVD, watch it once, then watch it again with the director's commentary on. It's hysterical! If you like this film, I also recommend Two Thousand Maniacs, and The Wizard of Gore. Two more Lewis gems with the same low budget everything in them, but equally as enjoyable. Have fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of Hershell Gordon Lewis "Blood Feast" is paper-thin:a sinister shop owner is trying to resurrect an Egyptian goddess Ishtar by butchering and dismembering beautiful girls.Fun-filled gore romp with cheesy acting and inept splatter scenes.The tongue removal scene is legendary among horror fans.The plot is just an excuse to move from one bloody murder scene to the next.I am fairly sure that back in 1963 images from "Blood Feast" were shocking for the audience from that time.That's why Hershell Gordon Lewis chunk-blower is so important as perhaps the first gore film ever made.Don't take "Blood Feast" seriously - it's just a gross-out horror comedy.7 blood feasts out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superbly gory for 1963.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With it's laughable attempts at acting, it's ridiculous storyline and it's cheese ball sets, "Blood Feast" stands as one of the worst 'films' ever put before the masses.This movie has some moments of what seems to be the most intentional kind of cheese. I don't think it was meant to be that way and that is what makes it so great. We have entire scenes filmed with a still camera. We have some utterly atrocious acting. We have some of the most campy sets and costumes ever. In some parts it is like a really bad, old episode of the original "Batman." We are led into scenes by fake signs on doors, things like that.What makes this movie so amazing is the authenticity of the camp and of course, the gore. The first time I saw this I was amazed at how creative H.G. Lewis was in filming some of the gore scenes. This dude had guts. (No pun intended...) For this to have been made in 1963 is nothing short of genius. It is so far ahead of it's time in that regard that the cheese and the camp is all well worth sitting through.A bizarre mix of Lucio Fulci, John Waters and early daytime TV.8 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The decrepit grandfather of gore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- This review contains what some might take as spoilers. -So this is it. Yup! The `legendary' ancestor of all them gore flicks: `Blood Feast' (read in most dramatic voice)!!! My eagerness to finally watch this `cult' movie totally surpassed the final impression I had after having endured this trashy nonsense. No, let me tell you, this movie is definitely not as worth watching as many so-called connoisseurs would like you to believe. There are, of course, many sequences that will provoke lots of unintended laughter: The incredibly bad acting (I especially loved to see all those `actors' obviously reading off their dialogue parts), the miserable attempt (by director H. G. Lewis himself) at creating a suitable soundtrack, and last but not least the complete lack of talent in terms of direction. Let me admit, though, that the gory effects will surely please the bloodthirsty masses. So let's see what we've got: An eye ripped out of its socket plus a leg hacked off inside a bathtub; a brain torn out of a young lady at the beach; a tongue forcefully ripped out from between another lady's red, red lips; and so on, and so on? Yes! That's all there is to it. Subtlety is completely lost on this movie, but we all DID know beforehand, didn't we?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Splatter Movie with Explicit Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Miami, the Egyptian serial-killer Fuad Ramses (Mal Arnold) owns a catering store and kills women taking parts of each one of them. Fuad worships the goddess Ishtar and is preparing a blood feast to resurrect her. Detective Pete Thornton (Thomas Wood) is investigating the murder cases trying to find who the killer is. Meanwhile the mother of his girlfriend Suzette Fremont (Connie Mason) hires the Fuad Ramses Catering store to provide the food for her birthday party. Fuad intends to sacrifice Suzette as the ultimate offering to Ishtar. Will he succeed?"Blood Feast" is a lame amateurish trash with laughable performances and ridiculous situations. The importance of this film is that it is the first splatter movie with explicit gore. It is unthinkable imagining the reaction of the audiences with the explicit violence and gore in 1963, despite the funny performances. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Not Available on DVD or Blu-Ray</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well whether you like it or not Blood Feast will always be a landmark movie. This is truly the year zero when it comes to depictions of graphic cinematic violence. Sure it wasn't the first movie to show scenes of gore but it took the concept to an unheard of level, basing the entire movie around the idea. Director H. G. Lewis is nothing if not fearless in his presentation of blood and guts. While the gore scenes are hardly realistic, they are often somewhat nasty. Lewis's subsequent gore movies follow this specific template, where they are simultaneously funny and mean-spirited. A crazy combination that simply should be a disaster but in the case of Blood Feast, the sheer audacity of it is jaw-dropping. It's a film that sure has its flaws. Production values are extremely low and the acting is often mind-boggling. Lewis's camera work is at best, uneven. But, frankly, the scenes of carnage are so in your face, and do not disappoint. The film remains far more violent than most horror films today and it's difficult to imagine what audiences of the early 60's would have made of the atrocities that spooled before their eyes. I expect it must've been a mixture of appalled outrage and morbid glee.Mal Arnold is pretty unforgettable as the murderous caretaker. His delivery of lines is just nuts; it often looks like he is reading off a board just off-screen. He's a lot of fun. Connie Mason provides the eye-candy and she is hardly an actress, but her stiff line-delivery fits into this trash-opus perfectly. Lewis himself is of course hugely unpretentious and straightforward as a film director, so he basically points the camera at the action and films, there is no artistry in Blood Feast. But this is very much a part of the fun, as this is pure exploitation with no apologies. In my opinion this remains Lewis's best feature. I realise it has many, many faults but I just find the whole thing a very entertaining trash-fest. And one of the most important exploitation films in history too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've never seen this movie, then go get it! It is the film that started it all in the gore/splatter genre. When I say 'started it all' I'm not paraphrasing or exaggerating, it really was the first move to show scenes of graphic violence. By todays standards, the violence may not be all that graphic, but when you watch it, try to imagine yourself as a teenager in the early sixties seeing this thing! When viewed in that context, the film really is quite shocking. I however, enjoy the film more for the laugh value than the horror aspect. Truth be known, there's nothing scary in this movie at all, but it is a gory good time for anyone who can enjoy movies whose 'cheesiness' is not a detractor from the finished product. I highly reccomend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best of the HGL movies. Features much fondling of animal innards, spread over the stomachs of sweet young things, most excellent eyebrows on the "old man" villain (probably about 32 years old), shameless reading of lines from convenient slips of paper, mugs, even the back of an actor's hand, and a limp which keeps shifting legs.But I think it's the Police Dept who steal the show in this movie. They're always standing in the same position around the desk (all their scenes must have been shot in one take) pondering ancient Egyptian mythology and admiring an enormous lime green ashtray which is the focal point of the frame and which is forever imprinted on my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blood Feast" is a typical schlock horror film from the 60's with unusually gory visuals: bright red blood drips from an empty eye socket; a killer yanks a woman's tongue out of her mouth while she struggles... as buckets of blood pour from her lips.This is a camp classic, a movie whose super-low budget only adds to the effect: scenes shot in master only, a single-desk police station "set," etc. An Egyptian God-worshipping caterer commits a series of grisly murders and... eats the victims himself? Serves them to other victims? It's hard to tell, and really doesn't matter.Complete with strait-faced in-jokes, this movie is perfect for riffing with a group of friends. Filmed in the lovably stark psychotronic-style, in which bathrooms, suburban homes and grocery stores all look like the same bare set... check it out.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy canoli! I decided to rent "Blood Feast" on a whim because I had heard that this movie was terrible, so terrible that one would wholly laugh their ass off. Let me begin by saying that this movie WAS hilarious! The funny thing is is that it wasn't meant to be a comedy. That's the ironic thing. I laughed at everything in this movie. The beginning scene where the woman gets her eye cut out is definitely the worst edit in motion picture history(if you've seen it you'll know what I'm talking about!) The actors - They didn't seem believable. Were they reading cue cards? The funniest actor award goes to the guy who played Tony, the victim on the beach (Were those Real tears that he was crying?) The music - that violin song is the funniest song. It's even funnier when you listen to it drunk or stoned. And those drum beats? Ahhh...soothing! However, I'll give it to HG Lewis for creating what is highly regarded as the "1st Gore Film." Can you imagine Faces of Death without gore? Or even Saving Private Ryan? All in all, it's a film for both horror fans and the types of people who want to laugh themselves to death for an hour straight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gold Store Mannequin Destroys Miami, film at 11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you went into this, taking it seriously, then the problem is at your end. The acting, props, special effects and story line are supposed to be hokey. Don't believe me? Then watch the movie with the Herschell Gordon Lewis and David F. Friedman commentary.The story, is simple, sacrifice women to appease and resurrect the Egyptian Goddess Ishtar.There is plenty of gore, and considering this is pre-FX, pretty impressive. Utilizing items such as chicken skin, studio blood mixed with Kaopectate to give it texture and a rotten lamb tongue (more on this later). This was how American Gore all started, this was the flagship and I value the ingenuity.Fuad Ramses (Mal Arnold) overacts to a degree that is comical and it fits perfectly. Ramses is killing and mutilating young women in a Florida suburb, taking bloody souvenirs to the idol of his revered goddess Ishtar, (which is a store Mannequin painted gold in a Channel dress). There are a series of quality kills, for its time and if you keep your mindset, in a place that accommodates 50/60's exploitation, I promise you, you'll enjoy yourself.There is one kill I do want to mention. Ramses infiltrates (surprisingly powerful for a short, thin gimp) Aldrid Olson, (whom by the way, was found by David Friedman at the Playboy mansion, he went there in search of an attractive woman with a large mouth(for the tongue scene), this is also where he found Connie Mason). Anyway, I digress, Ramses, proceeds to rip out Aldrid's tongue. This scene, as amateurish as the special effects were, was ghastly. The tongue was gruesome and in all actuality, it really was. It had once belonged to a sheep, it was a real tongue. The story behind it is that the production team had to obtain it from a slaughter house in Tampa, which was quite a haul from the production set. While it was resting in a refrigeration unit, the power had gone out and the tongue quickly became rank. However, getting a replacement was not possible due to scheduling restrictions. The solution was attributed to Scott H. Hall (if I remember right); he drenched the tongue in Pinesol which rectified the stench. Pretty gross, I'd say.The movie is well worth the watch, I also encourage you to re-watch it with the commentary.Happy Horrors</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gore Flick Is Born - In A Delightful Egyptian Blood Feast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herschell Gordon Lewis' "Blood Feast" aka. "Egyptian Blood Feast" of 1963 is literally THE first gore flick ever, and no lover of cult-cinema could therefore possibly afford to miss it! This pioneering gem of delightfully rancid exploitation is often dismissed as being an awfully acted unintentional comedy, but it is obvious that the comedy factor was entirely intentional. Fuad Ramses (Mal Arnold) owns a delicatessen store and catering service in Florida. He is also obsessed with Ishtar, the Egyptian goddess of beauty, love and evil. In order to resurrect the macabre deity, he kills and mutilates young women in order to create a new body for Ishtars spirit, that he plans to form out of body-parts he cuts out of his victims. While Detective Pete Thornton (William Kervin) is investigating the murders, Ramses hypnotizes a woman, who then engages him to throw a party for her daughter Suzette (Connie Mason), who is interested in ancient Egyptian culture. What the lady doesn't know is that Ramses is already planning a very special kind of feast... an Egyptian Blood Feast!As mentioned above, the film's campy character is absolutely intended. Hardly ever have I seen such a ridiculously looking movie psycho as Fuad Ramses, and Mal Arnold fits the role extremely well. Sure, the acting is awful, but everybody involved in the film is aware that the performances and production values are not exactly class A. "Blood Feast" is a film that never pretends to be more than campy, gory fun, but, it has long become a classic, both for its pioneering character as the first gore film ever, and its wonderful cheesiness. The minimalistic drum score also fits the film very well. All said, I am well aware that "Blood Feast" is a cheaply produced film with actors of the really bad kind, but it is also a hilarious film with a deserved cult-status and a wonderfully campy sense of humor, and even gorier than I expected it to be. As the very first splatter flick it is important in film history, but even apart from its influence and historical value, "Blood Feast" is about as entertaining as it gets. Sure, if you only like films like "Citizen Kane" and "12 Angry Men" this might not be your taste. For every fan of cult-cinema, gory fun, or a good laugh in general, however, this is a top priority, and every true cineaste should consider watching it at least once. I personally like to watch it over and over again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is very first "Gore" film in cinema history. Made in 1963 this film is still being shown and is still affecting people to this very day. I am living proof of that, since I was not around in 1963 and I became a "second generation" fan of this schlock fest (as well as a fan of the director,the legendary Herschell Gordon Lewis)through the wonders of home video. The "Godfather of Gore" Herschell Gordon Lewis probably described this film best when he stated that "It's not any good but it is the first of it's type so therefore it deserves some recognition". Truer words were never spoken. With it's bad acting, horrible costumes and hideous effects (a sheep's tongue used to represent that of a human plus various other animal viscera) "Blood Feast" is still shocking to this day because it leaves no stone unturned. Hearts are ripped out of chests, legs are cut off, and brains are ripped from the skulls of "nubile" young victims. Must see viewing for all true gore fans...followed up over 40 years later with the equally nauseating "Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat" which is also directed by Lewis (who is now in his eighties!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie That Revolutionized The Horror Genre Forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time the 1960s hit, the horror genre had grown not only in the popularity factor, but in the violence factor as well. The love for violence in cinema and grown higher and higher with the hammer horror movies, primarily Plague Of The Zombie in which a woman was decapitated on screen.Herschell Gordon Lewis and his partner David Friedman were racking their brains trying to think of something original and new that would catch the eyes of audience members and show them something that they had never seen before. Then, when they began to realize how popular violence in cinema was becoming, they decided to make the ultimate film of violence: Blood Feast.Blood Feast is a twisted tale of carnage about an elderly cook named Fuad Ramses. Fuad is a member of a rare religion, which worships an ancient Egyptian goddess name Ishtar. Fuad wants to offer an old fashion feast of blood to his goddess before he dies. When he gets a job catering a surprise birthday party for a young lady, he sees this as the perfect opportunity to offer this blood-caked meal to his goddess. So, he begins killing off women and collecting their body parts, primarily the insides.When compared to the films that have been released from the 1970s up to present date, Blood Feast is not violent by any means. However, in the early 1960s, audiences were not use to "gore" and therefore it shocked people all over the country. It was shot on a very low budget of 25,000 dollars, and made four million dollars, grossing back one hundred and sixty times its budget.Though it was rumored that Herschell Gordon Lewis conducted the gore effects himself, they were actually conducted by J.G. Patterson Jr, who later went on to direct the cult gore classic "Doctor Gore" AKA "The Body Shop." Patterson's special effects are now out-dated, but if you can watch the film while keeping it's time frame in mind, they are enjoyable. The blood is very bright and cheesy looking, but the guts and organs used in the film are great and truly sick. Some of them are actually real organs used from various animals.The screenplay, which was written by Herschell Gordon Lewis, Allison Louise Downe, and David Friedman is below-average, but you have to keep in mind that this was the first gore film to ever be made, and at the time they were mainly worried about making it violent rather then worrying about realistic dialog or character development. And who are we to argue with that? They are the ones who ended up getting rich off of it, not us.In the long run, Blood Feast is a very enjoyable cult classic gore film that will be enjoyed by fans of exploitation gore flicks, but it is for that audience and that audience only. Most fans of cinema in general should see it just to see the movie that changed the horror genre, but many of them will not like it.</fullReview>

But what really makes this film great, and I'm not kidding here, is that as wonderfully inept as it is, in 1963 it made a bloody fortune! If we apply Goethe's model of criticism -- "What was the artist trying to do, and did he do it?" -- to Blood Feast, the film is a masterpiece. H.G. Lewis was not Ed Wood. He never took his movies seriously and only made them in his spare time for the cash, which Blood Feast made in spades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Far As Bad Movies Go, This Is One of the Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever have an Egyptian feast? No? Well, you are in for a treat because in this film we have the incredible coincidence of an Egyptian caterer who wants to prepare an Egyptian blood feast and the mother of a student of Egyptian cults who wants to give her a special taste of Egypt. But, little does she know, this might result in a variety of gruesome murders.Herschell Gordon Lewis is the godfather of gore. This is a well-known fact and I could sing his praises here for paragraphs at a time... but I will not. Instead, I want to give credit to Mal Arnold, the actor who played Fuad Ramses. He was quirky, weird-looking and creepy. His acting was pretty awful, but compared to the acting of everyone else he seemed the most professional. (It is actually really funny how forced most of the dialogue seems.) As pointed out in my review for "Wizard of Gore", Lewis loves eyes and Ramses has the perfect "wild eyes".I am curious about who was going to eat the feast before the party came to Ramses' attention. He was already preparing it. So, like, does he just ask random customers if they are looking for an Egyptian feast and hopes that one will take him up on the offer? And should I care that this film constantly references Egypt while the god they refer to (Ishtar) is actually Babylonian with no Egyptian connection? I should care, but frankly, I do not.And here is why: the blood. Sure, the blood was paint-like... but it was also awesome. The color schemes in the 1960s make the bright blood of "Blood Feast" appropriate. Today it would look silly, but at the time it is actually rather gross, which is the intended goal when you are a gore master, I assume. Plenty of hacked up people (legs, tongues and more removed on screen).I have written that "Blood Feast" is on par with "Wizard of Gore" as far as being his masterpiece. So if you are looking for a taste of Lewis-style carnage, this is a great place to start. From the bloody beginning to the bone-crushing end, this is a tale of massacre and incompetent police that low-budget horror fans eat up like fava beans.As of September 2011, you can have this film in your collection on Blu-Ray, thanks to Image Entertainment. Besides the new technology, there are commentaries from Lewis and producer David Friedman, as well as plenty of special goodies. I would strongly urge anyone to pick it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blood Feast" is the first gore film by the notorious director Hershell Gordon Lewis and by God does it ever live up to its gigantic cult reputation! This may perhaps be one of the worst and dumbest movies ever scripted down, but it'll always remain hugely entertaining to watch and the influence it had on the horror industry is undeniable! Like all of H.G. Lewis' later horror movies, "Blood Feast" is very cheap and amateurishly put together trash cinema, in which all the regular aspects of film-making are secondary to a couple of extended and utterly gross slaughterings. There's no real story, let alone an attempt to create some tension, the camera-work is monotonous and the acting performances of the entire cast are FAR beyond horrible. We follow a crippled and hugely disturbed Egyptian caterer who randomly butchers young girls and amputates different body parts from their corpses in order to bring sacrifice to an ancient Egyptian queen. Even though his murderous trace isn't exactly that hard to follow, the local police squad has no idea where to look for their killer. Everything you heard or read about the gore in this film is true! It's truly outrageous and even now, over forty years later, still very few enthusiast horror directors manage to make their low-budget films as repulsive as the almighty Hershell Gordon Lewis did. We have a versatile selection of cut-off limbs, torn out tongues, bloody whippings and ? my personal favorite ? an overlong close-up of a poor girl whose brains are spread all over a beach. I recommend this film highly if it were only for the nauseating gore, but it's also worth watching with a group of friends so that you can list all the elements that are hilariously inept! The female star, for example, is supposed to be interested in Egyptian history and just attended a lecture on bloody sacrifices, yet one day later she willingly undergoes a ritual sacrifice like it was literally explained to her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Exploitation 'First' Can Never Be More Than a 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hershell Gordon Lewis and David Friedman made this tedious first exploitation flick to feature gore as 'something new,' since the nudie flicks were starting to lose money. The trailer for 'Blood Feast' shows every gore sequence in the film as a blatant promotional attempt to hook an audience.I was one. In 1963, I watched the trailer play in my hometown theater, the State Theater in Petaluma, California. That year it definitely was shocking !! to see this type of stuff on the screen; it fact, it was revolting. I had no wish to see the film, and it was never shown in conservative Petaluma.In 1967, however, it was part of what we called "The Ghouly Trilogy" which also included 'Two Thousand Maniacs' (1964) and 'Color Me Blood Red' (1965) playing on downtown Market Street in San Francisco at a $1.00 theater. These I went to see with other refugees from the Haight Ashbury. 'Blood Feast' as a film was entirely tedious, and the moments of gore did little to make the film more enjoyable. It was too totally killed by the feeble acting, slow and dreary editing, dull scenes and camera work, poor script, well, you can read the other reviews. Everything about it as a film was just terrible.After the overnight success of 'Blood Feast' in Philadelphia (where ECW also spent its gory glory years), Lewis said to Friedman, "What if we tried to make a good movie?" The result was '2000 Maniacs,' a much better film, which also became the subject of one of my hit songs, 'Pleasant Valley,' that I can send you over the internet.'Blood Feast' is not Ed Wood movie making. Ed Wood was an auteur compared to this type of exploitation film which was cobbled together to make some fast money. Wood's masterpiece, 'Glen or Glenda' (1953) and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' (1959) were artistic statements from an enthusiastic director / writer whose reach sadly exceeded his grasp. Hence the wonderful homage by Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, 'Ed Wood' (1994).As for 'Blood Feast' as the first gore flick, let it lie next to other historical cinematic firsts -- the first porno loop, the first animated scene, the first western, the first... well, all of those are more interesting than this non film. It deserves the worst possible treatment by Mystery Science Theater 3000.But, if you think about it, the first slasher flick was 'Psycho' (1960). Just compare its genius shower scene (worth a 10 all by itself) with the motel killing of the girl, or anything else in 'Blood Feast' and this clunker's rating has to go down to a minus 10.It can never get, or be, more than a one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Herschell Gordon Lewis, Florida's pioneering father of low-rent gore, is an Ed Wood type with a fixation on gushing blood, severed limbs, and ridiculous story lines. Whereas "Blood Feast" once stood as a revelation within the horror genre (coming 5 years before George Romero gave us the serious, straight-faced gore of "Night of the Living Dead"), it now plays like a sincerely-intended romp. From the mad caterer with the huge eyebrows and bug eyes, to the cardboard acting of Playboy centerfold Connie Mason, to a plot that has something to do with body parts being turned into stew to resurrect an Egyptian goddess, Mr. Lewis clearly has his tongue planted firmly in cheek. If you go into "Blood Feast" expecting full-bore terror, you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking to kill 67 minutes (and aren't we all?), its cheesy charm will do the trick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hershell Gordon Lewis "Blood Feast" was the first gore movie ever made and its remembered by the most for its bad special F/X and the ridiculous acting! However, it would be more than unfair to call it a bad film, because this little classic has more entertainment values than most of Hollywoods high budget productions! The story is about a weird old guy named Fuad Ramses who runs a catering service, but actually hes possessed by the idea to bring back the deceased Egyptian Queen Ishtar into life by stealing the guts of some young women...This film doesnt run longer than one hour, but it has a great value for the horror genre and its essential for every gorehound! Even John Waters tributed "Blood Feast" with a short screen shot in his "Serial Mom"(1994). Watch it and have a lot of fun! Cheers, Hershell!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why I have not commented, but now it is time. I have a strange history with Blood Feast. I am a horror film junkie and have been since I was a small child. In the 80s, I tried to watch as many VHS horror films at various rental places with my friends. I even came across HG Lewis stuff without realizing it. I know I saw Color Me Blood Red and Wizard of Gore. The covers attracted me, but they were nothing films--time wasters. Never thought much about them.In the early 90s, as an adult, my spouse and I found a cheap laser disc player at a thrift store for $5. There was a local place that rented laser discs, and they had a ton of them. I would go in and get movies I had not seen like Salo, but I loved the obscure horror stuff. One day under the B section I found Blood Feast. The cover looked awful, but I had to see it. The clerk tried entering it into the computer, but it was not in the computer. In fact, that meant the item had not been rented in 10 years since that is when they set up the computer system. She was shocked. I though it must have been really bad for a film to go unrented for that period of time. It was like finding treasure. I get home and put it in the player. Our jaws were on the ground. It was an amazing experience, and the blood... We told everyone about this film, but no one had heard of it. Now I am a film teacher, and I have a huge cult film collection. Blood Feast was one of the films that got me so into searching cult films. Yes, I have everything by Lewis, but nothing compares. It is a treasure of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Herschell Gordon Lewis carved his place in motion picture history with this movie which basically brought gore as we know it to horror movies. So every time we watch a Romero, Argento, Hooper, Fulci or Raimi splatter movie we should all bow down before him! Okay, 'Blood Feast's historical importance is beyond dispute, but apart from that is it worth watching these days? I say yes because it is one of the lousiest and stupidest horror movies ever made, and has at least oh, three or four bits where you will laugh so hard the beer (and you MUST watch this one while drinking beer!) will come out of your nose. This one is REALLY bad folks! In fact there isn't one redeeming feature about it. The flimsy plot (ancient Egyptian rites involving ritualistic murder are carried out by a stupid fellow with painted on eyebrows) is acted abysmally by one of the least talented casts ever assembled, and the whole thing has a budget of about $20 by the looks of it. 'Blood Feast' deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the worst efforts of Ed Wood Jr and Ray Dennis Steckler. This is as bad as it gets, only with added buckets of blood! Every gore-hound must watch this one at least once in their life. It's a trash classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Florida Gore: The History of Blood Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you were wondering, this is the one. Not The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Certainly not Friday The 13th. This is the one that (like it or not) the history books will show that is the granddaddy of Horror as we know it today. Regardless of the countless questionable qualities, no one can take that away from this movie. As inept as it is gory. As humorous as it is legendary. This is Blood Feast. I'll be honest, there ain't a single thing about this movie that is special, other than the fact that this is the first film in history to offer full-frontal gore. And when it comes down to it, Blood Feast would pretty much set the tone for how schlock and B-Horror would play out over the next quarter century. The director of this gruesome epic, Herschell Gordon Lewis apparently put 100% of his creativity into the gore effects, as the story leaves a little to be desired. About an Egyptian caterer, Fuad Ramses, who has been busy preparing a feast for a party thrown for the daughter of a wealthy socialite. Only, this feast really belongs to Ishtar, Fuad's Goddess (a statue), and with the right ingredients, Ishtar (supposedly) can be brought back to life. Unfortunately for several young ladies across Miami, Ishtar's feast requires various body parts, such as Arms, legs, tongues, etc. The scenes that follow would go down in history as the first to be considered "disgusting". Blood Feast stars the legendary Thomas Wood, and non-actress Connie Mason. Love it or hate it, you have no right to call yourself a Horror fan if you have not seen this movie, and that's a fact. Blood Feast is actually the first in Herschell Gordon Lewis's Blood Trilogy, which also includes the superior-beyond-words, Two Thousand Maniacs, along with the mediocre, Color Me Blood Red. Lewis would also go on to create such gore epics as The Wizard Of Gore and The Gruesome Twosome. Believe me, they don't call this guy the godfather of gore for nothing. Oh yeah, and be sure to check out Herschell's looooong-awaited gore-drenched sequel, Blood Feast 2, for what quite possibly may be the most entertaining Horror sequel in existence. Many Horror/gore directors have come and gone since 1963. Some were awesome (Lucio Fulci). Some, not so much (Nathan Schiff). But no one can deny that good ol' H.G. did it first. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bloodfeast" is a nice and gory though slightly frustrating film.**SPOILERS**Following a series of grisly murders, the Chief of Detectives, (Scott H. Hall) and Detective Pete Thornton, (William Kerwin) are stuck as there's no leads in the case. A wealthy socialite, Mrs. Dorothy Fremont, (Lyn Bolton) tries to get her daughter Suzette, (Connie Mason) off the violent crimes by throwing her a lavish party, and visits the catering service of Fuad Ramses, (Mal Arnold) to deliver an Egyptian style party. As the series of murders continue, the police are more helpless, as nothing has turned up in the investigation, and Pete decides to blow steam off while attending a lecture on Egyptian history with Suzette. During the course, a mention of a fanatical blood cult from the time period piques his interest, and learning more about it, realizes that the killer is a member of the cult and is trying to carry out the duties by trying to bring it's deity back to life, and race to stop the killer before it goes through.The Good News: There's very little good about this one, but there's a lot that they bring in. The biggest impact in the film is it's unrelenting and extreme gore. This comes in the form of several incredibly graphic kills. The opening victim not only has her leg cut off, she is first stabbed in the eye. There's also another victim who has their head smashed open, a leg is baked in an oven, a heart is cut out, a girl is flayed by whipping; and most extreme of all, a tongue is pulled out, roots and all. There is a rare intensity about these scenes, a determination to really rub the extreme violence in. Even though there are no impact shots of anything, the film instead trades them in their place are lingering "aftermath" shots not easily forgotten, including a bloody stump, complete with bone, sticking up out of the suds in a bathtub, brains spread across the sands of a beach, an empty mouth, and so on. These hold a really great intensity about them that makes up for their badly-done execution. The only other point worthwhile about it is the lone scene that registers anything resembling horror mood. Searching the killer's hideout, they turn on the lights in a darkened room and find that, in front of them the whole but unnoticed in the dark, is the disemboweled and completely mutilated body of a previous victim. This is simply the best scene in the film and really serves the film's best shock effect over the blood and gore. The short length also helps, as it's really over before it gets boring and overstays it's welcome. This here really has some good points about it.The Bad News: There isn't a whole lot really wrong with this one. The main thing wrong with the film is that there's way too much here that's incompetent. This is easiest to see in the special effects department. The gore in here, while brutal in design, is hardly anywhere near convincing. The fact that just about all of the graphic blood is so obviously red paint that it's hard to believe it's shocking. This really renders a lot of the deaths ineffective and give them a really goofy air about them. They're just too fake to be convincing and just come off as ridiculous. It's the same really for every single one of the kills, and that is where the film gets some real negative points. There's also the fact that there's no way around the characters could be as moronic as they are portrayed here. This is sheer stupidity on a massive level, there's really no way else to put it. The heroes who take all film to make the connection between what's going on that the viewers made in a couple minutes, the investigating police do even less to solve the crimes than the heroes do to think about it, and the fact that they complain about it and can't solve them just makes it all the more frustrating. These are what really hold the film back, but they're big ones.The Final Verdict: A pretty graphic, gory tale that exists only because of how bloody it is rather than how good it is, this is a really awkward entry. The blood and guts are good enough for gore-hounds, while those who absolutely hate technically-incompetent films will loathe this one.Today's Rating-R: Graphic Violence and Brief Nudity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the 74 video nasties that were banned in Britain. Considered the first "splatter" film, it was re-released uncut in 2005.One does not look at the acting ability or plot, but at the level of gore and blood in this film. From ripped out tongues, to brains splattered all over, it was a pioneer.Despite the fact that the lead, Connie Mason, was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for June 1963, there is no titillation in the film. It is pure blood and gore. Mason will return for the second of director Herschell Gordon Lewis' Blood Trilogy, Two Thousand Maniacs!, the following year. Mason completed the trilogy with Color Me Blood Red, the following year.For cinematic history, you have to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first ever "Gore" movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A crazed caterer who secretly worships an Egyptian goddess called Ishtar, he goes around the city seeking fresh young virgin girl as he murders and hacks them so he can use their parts for a Egyptian blood feast. The police are baffled and disgusted by these strange and vile murders as they investigate, a mother is planning to have a party as she invites the caterer over but he has some plans in mind so he can appease his goddess.This has become the first ever Gore flick to hit the screen, there'd been nothing like it before in that time but when this movie arrived in theaters in July 1962. It shocked audiences, made them sick and was a bona-fide box-office hit thus creating a landmark horror flick for using on-screen color splatter for the first time shown on any flick, yet the gory effects in this movie seem laughable by today's standards but back then it was unlike no one has ever seen on the screen.The acting is pretty bad but i'd do give this movie credit for being the first "blood and gore" flick and does hold something pretty special for gore-hounds and some old school horror fans.Also recommended: "Maniac ( 1980)", "Cannibal Ferox", "The Toxic Avenger", "Re-Animator", "Terror Firmer", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer", "Caligula", "Blood Diner", "Driller Killer", "Two Thousand Maniacs ( 1964 and 2005)", "Color Me Blood Red", "Wizard of Gore", "Bloodsucking Freaks", "Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2", "Dead Alive ( a.k.a.

		<shortDescription>Plenty of hacking and slashing and screaming... but it's really a terribly stupid film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You'll Recoil and Shudder as You Witness the Slaughter and Mutilation of Nubile Young Girls - in a Weird and Horrendous Ancient Rite!"Doesn't the tagline say it all? Widley considered to be the first ever gore/splatter film, "Blood Feast" from Herschell Gordon Lewis - the 'Godfather of Gore' as his following has coined him - doesn't fail in what it sets out to do, and that's to create a complete gore-fest with many a hacked off limbs and gory murders. All well and good, but it just doesn't work, or pull it off, when it is atrociously made, poorly written, and the acting is below terrible. A cult film by today's standards, my general take on the reception of this is that people who enjoy it are simply just enjoying the camp feeling, and tipping their hats off to what really was a fine achievement for 1963, as some of the scenes in this are pretty stomach-turning and well done. Limbs are hacked off with a machete, a tongue is cut out of a woman's mouth, there's a decapitation and lots lots more, including a pretty nasty flogging scene which I'm sure didn't go down too well with the censors back in '63.A series of brutal murders and mutilations have a town in the grips of fear - especially it's womenfolk, who are vehemently encouraged to not step outside their doors alone after dark. Depspite the obvious pattern to the murders, the police in charge of the investigation - Detective Thornton and Captain Frank - are completely baffled and don't have a notion whatsoever as to where to even start looking. The murders are being carried out by a psychopath with bushy eyebrows who takes the body parts into a cellar below his shop where he is creating a blood feast to honour some ancient Egyptian god. Conveniently, since his shop deals in all oddball accessories such as ancient food from Egytian times, he has been hired to organise a special party for a young woman who is obsessed with the ancient gods of Egypt and is studying them in college. Conveniently yet again... she is dating Detectice Thornton. But will he solve this oh-so difficult case in time before his woman ends up being the next victim of the... blood feast?Filmed in less than ten days on a budget reportedly as low as $25,000 (I guess that would buy you A LOT of red paint and fresh meat from the local butchers), and although it certainly did break a lot of taboos, and established a landmark in horror - which it cannot be denied - it's still a pretty bad film, and despite its very modest length of 67 minutes, it's very boring and feels so much longer. Why I think this is so popular amongst a certain branch of horror fans, is because it's gore effects still hold up reasonably well today, and it is really unintentionally funny and a guilty pleasure for some I'm sure, to watch. However, I do not fit with this branch, because I just found this to be almost unbearable to watch at times, and had it not been for the brilliant gore and special effects, I would have given this a burnt-out rating of 1. It doesn't even achieve a decent atmosphere - it's really all just hacking and screaming and watching some of the most stupid characters running around on screen. The first movie to ever be just labelled and advertised for it's violence, I think its no surprise that the violence is all that can be credited; the acting is possibly the worst acting you'll ever see on screen (And I've seen the works of Ed Wood, and the god-awful "The Beast of Yucca Flats"). The majority of the time, the actors are completely OTT, and the best example of that is in the scene with the boyfriend being comforted by the useless Detective Thornton and Captain Frank. This pair were the predecessors to Dumb and Dumber, here's a fine example of their expertise, this one when they finally realise that the Egytian feast going on at Thornton's girlfriend's house isn't what it appears to be - "Call the Fremonts, fast! And for Pete's sake, don't let them eat anything!" What really got me was that Thornton attends an Egytian seminar with his girlfriend, where the lecturer is conveniently discussing the very god that the psycho killer is worshipping, detailing exactly what a certain lunatic would do to pay tribute to this god, yet Thornton fails to see the connection, and just sits back grinning like a damn fool when the answers are right in front of him! It all builds up to a hilarious ending with the dumb cops chasing and shooting at the killer. Unsurprisingly, this made it onto the list of 72 video nasties outlawed by the BBFC, and being made in 1963, it has the honour of being the oldest film to make it onto that infamous list. Well, unlike many of the other movies on that list, I can see why this made it onto it. Gorehounds, fans of the bizarre and occult, and just extreme movie buffs like myself, will be compelled to track this down and watch it, and I'm sure I won't be the only one who ends up laughing all through or finds themselves anticipatively counting down the minutes. "Blood Feast" is one artifact that should remain buried.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Herschell Gordon Lewis movie means that you should expect copious amounts of gore and a heap of bad acting within something filmed for the cost of Michael Bay's toiletry bag and with Blood Feast you get . . . . . . . . . . . copious amounts of gore and a heap of bad acting within something filmed for the cost of Michael Bay's toiletry bag. The fact that it's also consistently entertaining, for both the right and the oh so wrong reasons, is a plus.Mal Arnold plays Fuad Ramses, a strange man who runs his own exotic catering company when he's not selling books about ancient rites. He also worships a statuette of the goddess Ishtar and kills women to remove and preserve parts of their body, ready for the titular blood feast. When a woman hires him to cater for her he plans a themed meal that will use all he has gained so far and bring about the resurrection of his beloved goddess. If he isn't discovered before the main sacrifice is made.Allison Louise Downe wrote this screenplay, based on a story by David F. Friedman and director Lewis himself, but we won't hold that against her forever. It does provide the necessary exposition and a decent mix of the gory, the expository and the supposedly tense. Unfortunately, either due to the acting or the written word or both, there are many moments here that just feel as if they're being improvised by people who couldn't remember more than one key phrase at any time.The direction from Lewis is very Lewis-like. Hey, I don't want to insult the man and come under fire from his many, many fans but he was always about the gore (as his affectionate moniker "The Godfather Of Gore" reveals) and was never really able to elevate his movies above their meagre budgets. Mind you, what he does with the pocket change available is actually quite impressive when you consider the wastefulness of many other genre movies.Acting? Well, everyone is amusing but nobody here is being called up for the next stage version of Hamlet and I suppose that's the nicest way I can put it. Arnold is wonderfully weird while we get William Kerwin as a bland detective and the lovely Connie Mason as his swell gal, and potential victim.Gorehounds will be sated, at the very least, as limbs are ripped off, tongues removed and brains scooped. All in aid of making the meal of a lifetime. Masterchef was never like this.</fullReview>

She calls for a local caterer, called Fuad Ramses, who promises to prepare her an Egyptian feast, that has not been prepared for 5,000 years. Suzette's boyfriend, police detective Pete Thornton, is investigating a series of murders. Someone has been attacking young women and harvesting organs and body parts.

		<shortDescription>The one that started it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Stomach churning movie by 1960's "King of Gore" Herschell Gordon Lewis that opened the floodgates to the countless blood and slasher movie that followed since it's release in 1963. "Blood Feast" is still as shocking today, to those who first see it, as it was to unsuspecting audience's of movie-goers over forty years ago even without the advance of special effects of todays motion pictures.This deranged Miami caterer Fuad Ramese is obsessed with an ancient Egyptian Goddess Ishter who was worshiped back then, some 5,000 years ago, by a fanatical blood cult that demands human female body parts to used in a ritual blood feast in resurrecting her from the dead. Determined to bring Ishter back to life Ramese goes on a murder spree killing women all around the city of Miami. Ramese cuts off the womens arms legs and even ripping out organs to make his dream, Ishter coming back to life, come true. Almost as soon as the movie "Blood Feast" starts we see the sick and demented Ramese in action as he attacks a young woman taking a bath. The deranged psycho pokes out her eye and then saws off her leg in graphic blood-red color that leaves nothing to the imagination of the movie audience. On his holy mission for Ishter Ramese is later seen attacking a young couple making out on the beach. Knocking out the boy Ramese then cuts out the girls brains to be used in his Egyptian blood feast.The city now is in a state of panic as the police can't find any clue to who's committing these sicking and unmentionable crimes. Ramses overplays his hand by running into a Mrs. Freemont who came to his catering shop for advice in an exotic feast that she's planning that weekend for her collage student daughter Suzette. Ramese suggests that she have an Egyptian Feast with him supplying all the necessary ingredients, human body parts, which he of course keeps secret for the naive Mrs. Freemount. What the not so clever Ramese doesn't know is that Suzette's boyfriend is Miami PD Let. Pete Thornton the cop that's in charge of the case involving Ramses murder victims. Let. Thornton like Suzette is also fascinated with ancient Egyptian culture; including the history of the blood cult that worshiped Ishter.What really got to me, even more then then blood and gore, about the movie "Blood Feast" in the villain in the movie Ramses who supposed to be so deadly and dangerous could barley walk straight much less be able to run from the police after he committed his many crimes. Slowly and painfully dragging his right leg behind him all throughout the movie Ramese was anything other then a crippled old man who ,like in the attack on the couple on the beach, should have easily been taken care of by anyone, man or woman, in good health and under 60 years of age! Yet he seemed to be almost unstoppable in his actions that resulted in the murder and dismemberment of some half dozen women. At the party at the Freemont home Ramese needs to have the unsuspecting Suzette lay down on the kitchen table, out of view of her mother and the invited guests, in order to sacrifice her to Ishter for his plan to bring the Goddess of his dreams back to life. The bumbling killer is so clumsy and his dialog is so hilarious saying "do this to make an old man's heart be glad" to Suzette, as he's about to slaughter her, that the movie loses it's built up tension and terror at the very moment it's supposed to terrify and scare it's audience out of of their seats.Interrupted by Mrs. Freemont before he could murder her daughter Suzette Ramese is on the run for his life, what else could you give a lowlife sicko like Ramese but the electric chair, as Pete and half of the Miami police department pull up to the Freemont home as Ramese tries to make his getaway limp leg an all. It was fitting for Ramese, the garbage that he is, to end up in back of a garbage truck in his attempted escape from the police. Trying to hide from the police Ramese is crushed and compacted by the unsuspecting sanitation man driving the truck! As the movie ends Pete tells the sanitation man that he did the city of Miami a great service by taking out and disposing this revolting piece, Fuad Ramese, of trash. That was no big deal for the sanitation driver in that taking out and disposing garbage was just another days work for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story, horrible acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blood Feast has been one of the most talked about films. Banned in numerous countries for its violent content. It is from one of the masters of cult films who does a great job in setting up the shots, but it does fall short. The story line is somewhat descent, but the acting is just terrible, which did take some of the fun out of watching the film. This film could have been so much better if the talent was. The Ramses character could have been a bit more developed. We know nothing about him except that he is a caterer. If we learned more about him and his victims the story would have flowed a bit more. No character is truly developed throughout the film so when they are threatened in any way you just get a feeling of whatever where's the next victim.If you like gore this is a film for you. The body parts look awesome and there is lots of blood.It is a fun film that should be watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this movie was a dead animal, a buzzard wouldn't touch it. But there has to be a certain distinction in being the first of anything, and H.G. Lewis has the distinction of having made the first real splatter film, even if he broke ground that never should have been broken and made a mess that never should have been made.If this sort of fare isn't up your alley, you'll know it by the title, but if you've been a willing observer of The Evil Dead, Hellraiser, Phantasm and the like, Blood Feast is the creaking granddaddy of them all. And if you think Plan 9 from Outer Space is hilarious, you can't go wrong here. If you haven't seen this one, prime yourself with some of your favorite beverage and get ready for an eye-popping laugh-fest. With a script that must have been written over lunch and shot for maybe a hundred dollars (or whatever the film stock and a dozen gallons of red paint cost) this IQ-lowering howler features a cast that couldn't act their way out of a church nativity play, god-awful cardboard sets, inappropriate blaring music, and dialog that makes Edward D. Wood look halfway professional. Don't deny yourself any longer. You know you've been planning to see it for years, but always settled for less. Long after you've forgotten all those generic splats that have followed in its wake, you'll never forget the real thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, this film is fun to watch and laugh about.There's something incredibly funny to me about schlock-murder that happens while you hear "How Dry I Am" being played (poorly) on a violin...And did anyone else ntoice that Fuad's limp changes legs in the film (more than once)?How terrible a film! Yet, compellingly fun.I had to give this a "1" rating, but I wish you'd all see it just once. It's MST3K material of the highest caliber, and yet they never panned it! I guess the silliness of the movie was too much for even Best Brains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This picture showed nice looking gals which did brighten up this so called story about Egyptian rituals and a caterer who enjoyed his meat prepared on the raw side of things. There is a serial killer on the loose who does horrible things to all the females he captures and you will have to see the film because the scenes are too graphic to describe, except that it is real gore and blood all over the place. The worst thing about this film is the poor acting by all the actors and the fake hair or powder to make a person look old. This is a film you will enjoy seeing on Halloween night and you are trying to get all spooked up about old Egyptian customs and what happens to poor young virgins. Sick film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Popular notorious/infamous gore film from the Grandpappy himself, HGL, concerning a wild-eyed, gray-headed nut-case, Fuad Ramses(Mal Arnold), a caterer for Petesake, who worships an Egyptian goddess, Ishtar, god of blood, for whom he keeps an idol of in a secret chamber inside his store where he cuts and cooks meat. Fuad hunts his prey through a list of female client?le whose names are on a waiting list for a published novel of his concerning Egyptian mythology. He, in unhinged delight, surprises his victims, removing parts of their body often using a machete or cutting tool of some sort. He believes that once he has gathered all the parts needed that Ishtar will return to life. Fuad ultimately sets his sights on Suzette Fremont(Connie Mason), whose mother desires for one of his elaborately staged catering services using an Egyptian setting. Suzette even attends classes on Egyptian folklore with boyfriend/cop Pete(William Kerwin)in tow. Pete, along with his boss, Frank(Scott H Hall)are trying to find any clues that can help them stop Fuad's murdering spree, often coming up with small bits of info from whoever can at least partially identify him, including a woman's whose face was carved to the bone, eyeballs removed, and another victim's emotionally ravaged boyfriend who briefly glimpsed Fuad before being cold-cocked. The film slowly but surely depicts Fuad's methods of attack on females and grisly displays of violence towards their bodies all in the name of Ishtar, the goddess he'd do anything for.AS expected, Blood Feast is technically crude on all levels. Pacing, editing, acting, camera-work, dialogue, and gore all presented unglamourously and flatly. HGL loves dragging his camera's eye across a bloody and ghastly mutilated female body. One scene has the camera gazing strongly at a woman's bashed-in skull with her brains spilled out(..before this HGL shows Fuad staring lustfully at bits of brain in his hands).The first female victim is the unfortunate victim of an eye and leg removal while naked and vulnerable in her bathtub. This was HGL's opening scene setting up just what his future gore films would be like. Lots of blood on display and the cast, especially Mason, are horrendous and dull performers. An audience embraces this film's cheap, amateurish and sick nature for HGL provides a certain type of entertainment geared towards a crowd looking for the exact opposite of skill and craft. Charm is a word thrown around in regards to HGL's films because of how they do not adhere to any kind of tasteful standard. Before there was TROMA and John Waters, there was HGL laying the groundwork for future generations in regards to bad taste and low-budget trash.</fullReview>

The story, if you can even call it that, is about a man named Faud Ramses who runs his own catering company, and butchers women on the side to feed his blood god Ishtar! For some reason, this garbage has a cult following that has kept it alive to this day. Do yourself a favor, and pass on this turkey! Its not even tolerable as a B movie.

		<shortDescription>A very flawed, but also very influential film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A decade of many social changes and cultural revolutions, the 1960s also were an important period in the history of cinema. Thanks to the availability of new light-weight cameras that were easier to afford, the 60s saw the rise of independent cinema as an answer to what the Studio System was making at the time. This was a crucial period for horror, as this meant that by working outside the System, the filmmakers were no longer tied by the rules of the Production Code (which eventually would be abandoned in 1967), so they were able to take horror in new directions by pushing the envelope further in terms of violence and sexuality. American filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis realized this, and in 1963 moved from the erotic genre to horror (which was a more profitable genre), and directed the movie that many consider the first "splatter film" and the movie that introduced explicit gore to the genre: "Blood Feast".In "Blood Feast", Mal Arnold plays Fuad Ramses, a psychotic Egyptian caterer who follows the ancient religion of the blood-lust goddess Ishtar. Fuad wants to perform the highest rite for Ishtar: the Blood Feast, which is a banquet that requires the body parts of several young virgin girls for its correct preparation. To prepare his rite, Fuad begins to hunt and mutilate young women, successfully evading the clueless detectives (William Kerwin and Scott H. Hall) who are after him. But when the wealthy Mrs. Fremont (Lyn Bolton) hires him to make the banquet of his daughter Suzette's (Connie Mason) party, Fuad decides that the party is the perfect occasion to finish his legendary Egyptian Blood Feast, so he begins to kill more women, hoping to finish the feast on time for the unsuspecting guests at Mrs. Fremont's party, who are unaware that Fuad is planning to honor his goddess at their party.Based on a story by director Herschell Gordon Lewis and producer David F. Friedman, "Blood Feast" was written by Allison Louise Downe, an actress from Lewis and Friedman's previous erotic films who would become a frequent collaborator for the duo. The plot is essentially very simple as it focuses on how Fuad butchers girl after girl while the police ineptly tries to uncover his identity. While some would use this plot to create suspense and mystery, Downe knew that what Lewis wanted was to shock audiences, so she gives him as many chances to display gore as possible without caring too much for character development, believable dialogs or the creation of tension. Anyways, it is obvious that this wasn't meant to be taken seriously, as the movie is filled with enough wackiness to make clear that more than a horror, this is a delightfully grotesque black comedy.In this his debut in the horror genre, director H. G. Lewis shows that when he decided to use gore in his films, he really meant it, as the movie is filled with a wide array of mutilations, whippings and other similarly gruesome activities in very graphic detail (for its time); although of course, always with that outrageous style located too far from realism to be taken for something more than good (albeit macabre) fun. Certainly, Lewis is not a director to look for when one wants moody and atmospheric horror, he goes for the visceral reactions the genre is able to pull off, and "Blood Feast", in all its gory glory, is a clear example of this. While made with the sole intention of making a profit, "Blood Feast" shows that there is an artist inside the businessman, as while the movie is poorly made, Lewis makes an outstanding use of colors (specially red) and music in the film.While the work of Downe, Friedman and Lewis was certainly influential and "Blood Feast" is a classic splatter film, one has to be honest and say the truth: the acting is one of the worst in the genre. Well, not everyone is bad, Mal Arnold and William Kerwin manage to make their characters interesting, specially Kerwin, who really shows some talent in his work and is probably the only one in the cast who can portray any emotion. former playmate Connie Mason plays Suzette Fremont, and hers is definitely the worst performance among the main cast. Lyn Bolton, who plays her mother, is nothing amazing, but compared to Mason, hers is a noteworthy performance. Finally, Scott H. Hall completes the group of awful performances with his acting as Frank, although at least Hall has the excuse of not being a professional actor.Now, the terrible acting of the cast seriously damages the film, and the mixture of the low-budget, the silliness of the plot and Lewis inability to bring anything good out of his actors doesn't really help to improve this. One could say that this is the perfect recipe for a disaster, but Lewis wisely turns this problem to his favor by keeping an unpretentious attitude through the film, playing these flaws into the black humor of the film with an almost naive joy. It is often this attitude what saves the film from being a tedious bore on most of the times, at it's kind of slow due to Lewis' lack of expertise. I'm not saying that the film works perfectly (it definitely doesn't), as it is not exactly a good film; but at least Lewis manages to make it better than what one could expect.To tell the truth, "Blood Feast" is far from being a masterpiece of horror, and it's not even a good movie in the classic sense of the word; but it has something special, a special charm that makes it fun, it has magic. Fortunately, Lewis went on to make better films than this (although also did worse), but as the original splatter film, "Blood Feast" is a must see for every horror fan with an interest in the gory side of cinema. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GoreMongral's Review: Blood Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has been into horror for awhile has sure to have heard or seen the name H.G.Lewis pop up from time to time. For those not educated he is one of the godfathers of the drive-in movie. His movies like the one Im reviewing seem to attract that certain crowd that likes their movie alittle off the beaten path. Such is the case with "Blood Feast" a film that for all rights is not good but for some reason despite the terrible acting, cheesy close-ups and goofy gore manages to entertain....those of said certain crowd.Fuad Ramses is a shop owner who caters to people who have a persuasion for Egyptian delicacies. After an intro to the murder of a young woman Mr.Ramses gets a request to cater for a young girls surprise birthday party. Only this dinner is what is called an "Egyptian Feast" which is more or less a ritual designed to honor the Egyptian Goddess Ishtar. Honoring her is simple, sacrifices of young woman and lots of them.The movie from here goes through some so-bad-their-good dialog exchanges especially between the chief of police and his Detective Pete Thornton. There is really no mystery here who the killer is as the movie pretty much rotates between Ramses, the police detective and the young girl,who's party he is to cater,Suzette. Some gore and 60's girls to google at ensue leading to a "crushing" finale."Blood Feast" if viewed in the right frame of mind and with the right group of friends is a fun film, though it will not ever be considered a classic to the mainstream crowd those who like the drive-in scene of the era (1960's) will more than likely enjoy themselves with this one, I know I did.With solid bad acting and an Egyptian Cult murderer on the prowl how can you go wrong. I give Blood Feast the modest score of: 5/10: Only for the fans of this stuff as any "serious" critics will turn up their cynical noses. I for one was modestly entertained.</fullReview>

But that's not what is hilarious. What is hilarious is the terrible acting (I swear I've seen nursery plays with better performances), the bad dialogue, the badly set-up scenes, bad shots, the background (check out the statue in Ramses' background), laughable score, and unnecessary explanations of things that the audience had figured out hours before.

		<shortDescription>Some very weird religious rites in HG Lewis' splatter "masterpiece"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herschell Gordon Lewis has a lot of things to be proud of himself for with regards to this film. Aside from being the oldest film on the BBFC's "Video Nasty" list, Blood Feast is also the film most often credited as "the first splatter flick ever made". Technically, the movie doesn't have a lot in it's favour, as it's just as inept as most HG Lewis films; but at least it proves once and for all the British Board of Film Classification doesn't have a sense of humour, as this movie is more likely to make you cry tears of laughter than deprave and/or corrupt. Seeing as this is the first splatter film, HG really deserves a lot of credit, as he was pretty much walking new ground with this film; and the gore, as ever, is filthy and disgusting; and would have took a lot of guts on the directors' part to dare release this film back in 1963. The plot takes in the classic idea of other society's codes of conduct, and follows an Egyptian caterer who offers to put on his own special 'Egyptian Feast' at the Birthday party of a young girl. However, he forgot to mention that he's been murdering women and stealing their body parts in order to resurrect his goddess...It's clear that the Godfather of Gore isn't too concerned with realism. The murders and the reasons behind them are expected to be silly, but the director packs the film with further ridiculous details, and it all helps to make this film the fine piece of trash that it is. Things such as the policeman discussing the case details with his girlfriend, the newspaper headline that reads "Legs Cut Off!" and my personal favourite; the fact that the murderer is working from a book titled "Ancient WEIRD Religious Rites" make this the film that it is. Herschell would go on to make gorier films (such as The Gore Gore Girls), but this one is still pretty gritty, especially for it's time. We see guts cut out, tongues pulled out and more. The actor in the role of the Egyptian psycho, Mal Arnold, really does look hilarious with his blue hair and polished appearance; but perhaps best of all is the fact that he's doing a (bad) Christopher Lee impression! Every scene in the film in almost completely inept, with atrocious acting featuring throughout...but hey, it's all in good fun and so long as you aren't too bothered about technical details, Blood Feast is a must see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blood Feast" is one of those landmark films that began a whole new genre of 'cinematic art'. What "Psycho" (1960) did for slasher-flicks, what "Bonny and Clyde" (1967) and "The Wild Bunch" (1969) did for on-screen violence, what the TV-cartoon show "Rocky and Bullwinkle" (1959-1964) did for entertaining adults as well as children, THIS FILM did for the splatter/gore movie genre. It's the granddaddy of them all, and it is definitely one of those "it's so bad it's good" films and a true must-have for any discerning gore hound's collection.What's with the bluish hair on Fuad Ramses, the crazed killer/slasher/ caterer in this flick? In one scene where he's on the phone, his hair matches the color of the Kleenex boxes in the background! His limp also reminds me of another wacko, the goat-kneed Torgo, the 'assistant to the master', of "Manos, the Hands of Fate" infamy.Yes, this film has atrocious acting and production values, is terribly-dated, and mostly a curiosity now, but for its day it had plenty of impact on unsuspecting American movie audiences in July, 1963, when it was first released. Remember, this is nearly four months prior to the true horror of the assassination of the 35th President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. America would never be the same thereafter, from that event and this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking cult classic from The Godfather Of Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as I know, HG Lewis's Blood Feast is the first gore film. The film left its mark and is a very influential and very entertaining micro budget horror flick that would become a cult classic. HG Lewis may not have been the most talented film maker, nor did he have an abundance of resources to make his movies. But the man has style and knew how to entertain and build an audience. Having said that, Blood Feast is good for what it is. It is campy fun that obliterated the taboo of blood, gore and violent content in film. For the time,(1964)this kind of material was unheard of ,shocking and totally extreme. HG Lewis had balls for making this and thankfully pulled the chain on "good taste" and "moral fiber" by flushing them down the toilet for good. Blood Feast, was way ahead of its time and did well in the drive in circuit shocking audiences with chunks of blood red carnage splattering across the screen. Our hero, Fuad Ramses is on a mission from God.(the Egyptian God's actually) He is to prepare a feast in honor of Goddess Istar from the body parts of several female victims to insure that she will live again. No such thing has been attempted in five thousand years, so caterer and devotee of the ancient religion has to give it a go. Blood Feast indeed delivers and holds up as a great piece of campy entertainment. There also is creepiness and dark humor to accompany the gore. While I am indeed a fan of HG Lewis's work and he made a lot of similar films, there is something special about Blood Feast. This film, as well as many of Hershell's other films are very influential to many film makers and have entertained generations of horror fans. I would regard Blood Feast as essential viewing for horror fans, especially to those into more extreme or underground films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for an early splatter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to rate it higher than 6 but I think that would be too generous for it's simple storyline and it's underdeveloped characters. The killer does not really have a clear idea how to revive the Egyptian goddess and also it seems way too easy how he could victimize the young girls which had to serve as sacrifices for his plan. The final victim he wanted to make looks rather amateurish and the way he gets caught made me frown a bit. The ending feels quite rushed too. However where the movie excels and certainly for the time it was released is the graphical (read gore, blood and guts) department. It looks very real and still shocking to today's standards I think. It might not be the first splatter as I have read there is a Japanese movie which name escaped me now that came before it. But for one of the earliest movies in this genre is surely deserves some more recognition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blood Feast apparently derives its notoriety from basically two facts: 1. it has gore; 2. it is at least recognized as the first "splatter" movie, in that it showed visceral gore. Both are indeed facts in that they are true. But what else? Is Blood Feast a good movie? Not really. The 1960's had already seen the in-your-face horror of Hitchcock's Psycho, but where that movie plays with the audience emotions in an intelligent way and is clearly a product of talented film making; Blood Feast is a prime example of cheap, exploitative and amateurish grind house film making. Maybe that is a merit in itself.The gore serves as the only major attention drawer in a film with abysmal acting, camera use, sound and script. Only watch this if you're a fan of "so bad, it's good".

All of the characters from the cops to the victims were complete idiots. Even the make-up and costumes are ridiculous. The script was so bad and the acting was so stiff, it's laughable. How can something some bad be so entertaining? I'm not sure if Hershel Gordon Lewis meant for this to be tongue in cheek humor or what.

Just for a little taste: terrible acting, a script full of holes (though I liked the premise) and that soundtrack that just went on and on and on and on. Those elements are familiar to many cult flicks, and by now I can say I have seen a few. But, having seen 'a few', I can also say I've learned what to look for better. Some of those elements even become charming at some (perverted? whatever) point... And, as for the music, at some times it ws great nd appropriate. The beautifully stylized gore and use of color made for a great atmosphere at quite a few moments. So, I should try 'Two Thousand Maniacs!' (1964) again sometime, which I didn't appreciate as much as this one... I have seen 'a few' since, indeed.A big 7 out of 10 for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great DVD for anyone even remotely interested in the horror/gore genre and the history of film in the U.S. The movie itself is no great shakes--the plot can be summarized in a sentence or two. A creepy caterer ("exotic catering for unusual affairs") named Fuad Ramses stalks fetching young women in order to harvest their body organs and dismembered parts. He does this as part of an ancient ritual to bring back an evil deity named Ishtar. (He's even got an elaborate shrine and sacrificial table in the back of his business.) You know what type of movie it is going to be when the opening scene has a pretty young thing lounging in a bubble bath with a book to keep her company--just a little light reading ("Ancient Weird Religious Rites") to relax with. And here comes ol' Fuad to lop off a couple of limbs. Gristle and gore and blood everywhere! Repeat five or six times and that's the film. All 67 minutes of it. Fuad (played by a buggy-eyed and gimpy Mal Arnold) finds and eviscerates/chops up girl after girl until a couple of inept cops somehow manage to stop him. What makes the film so groundbreaking is that is truly was the first splatter/gore/dismemberment flick. This is THE FILM that spawned an entire genre. Someone had to break through into 1960s conservative America and director Herschell Gordon Lewis was just the man. HGL, previously known as a director of sexploitation films, nudie cuties, and naturist flicks ("Daughter of the Sun," "Goldilocks and the Three Bares," "Nature's Playmates," etc.) turned the U.S. entertainment industry on its head with the release of Blood Feast. He went on to other gore classics such as 2000 Maniacs and Color Me Blood Red, among others. Shooting on a shoestring budget (less than $25,000), HGL's motto was "We don't want it good, we want it Thursday." No rehearsal scenes and no reshoots (waste of film). Actor doesn't show up for his part? No biggie, just yank a guy off the crew and have him write his lines on the palm of his hand. Problem solved. By far the best thing about this DVD is the commentary track. Director HGL and Producer David Friedman discuss the making and marketing of the film. "We had no reverence for established procedures." The opening scene has a radio with an announcer's voice. HGL comes clean--"That's my voice on the radio. We did that for a very logical reason--we didn't want to pay anybody." The commentary is a FASCINATING behind-the-scenes look full of trivia and interesting anecdotes. They discuss how they shipped the movies out to drive-in theaters, how the word-of-mouth gave the movie legs (good thing, too--no advertising budget), and how different communities tried to shut them down. For one scene, Fuad had to pull the tongue out of a screaming girl. How to make this work? HGL told his guy to go out and get a girl with the biggest mouth he could find. So, they ended up with some big-mouthed Swedish girl and shoved a bloody sheep's tongue down her gullet for the scene. We learn on the commentary that the fridge where they were keeping this tongue fritzed out and the meat was so spoiled by the time of filming that they had to douse it in Lysol before using it. (We also learn that the editor of the scene is non other than Bob Sinise--father of Gary Sinise!). The film also stars Playboy Playmate Connie Mason as the main object of Fuad's perverted plan. Of course, she can't act. Being a model, what she CAN do is pose. So she poses each scene. Even so, she could give acting lessons to some of the others.</fullReview>

The film was shot on a low budget of $24,000 over 4 days with cast mostly amateur actors and without a finished script. the film is pretty inept and shows signs on the speed it was made with actors not given time to learn their lines (last minute replacement Scott Hall can clearly be seen reading his lines off his hand in two scenes!) and the acting pretty appalling with widely over the top Mal Arnold and half decent William Kerwin coming of best. The completely wooden but attractive Connie Mason comes off worst. the films plot and characters are generally daft but serve the purpose of getting to the point of showing the gruesome gore. Hershel Gordon Lewis would go on to make many gore films the best been Two Thousand Maniacs and The Wizard of Gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete ineptness doesn't override its historical significance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the early 1960's, when drive-in theaters were still all the rage and the place to go for some haunted house and alien invasion B-movie thrills, producers were completely oblivious to a colossal gap in the market. That is until 1963, when producer David F. Friedman and director Herschell Gordon Lewis came up with a 'script' called Egyptian Blood Feast, a film that would be designed to not only show gratuitous violence, but to have the explicit gore as its main selling point. So Friedman hyped up publicity by handing out 'vomit bags' at screenings, and going as far as taking out an injunction on its own film so kick up a fuss. The film was pants, but the legacy is history, and so was born gore cinema, a sub-genre that horny teenagers still flock to in order to get their cheap thrills.The film follows the exploits of Muad Ramses (Mal Arnold), an exotic caterer and author of 'Ancient Weird Religious Rights'. Socialite Dorothy Freemont (Lyn Bolton) enters his store and asks Ramses to create a party to remember for her daughter Suzette (Connie Mason), to which Ramses obliges, hoping to create an Egyptian feast that will re-awaken his god Ishtar. The town is beset by gruesome murders, with bodies being butchered and dismembered, puzzling Detective Pete Thornton (William Kerwin), who is co-incidentally studying Egyptian history with, co- incidentally (there's a pattern emerging!) Suzette. Will the detectives be able to unravel the mystery? Will Ramses create his feast, causing the re-birth of Ishtar? Will anyone point out how ridiculous Ramses' fake eyebrows are?It is easy to make fun of this film - this is H.G. Lewis after all. Yet while every conceivable factor of Blood Feast's production is of the lowest standard, you can't argue with the film's importance. Ramses is an instantly forgettable madman, but he is the original machete-wielding maniac, paving the way for countless slasher imitators, from Michael Myers to Jason Voorhees. Lewis himself said it best - "I've often referred to Blood Feast as a Walt Whitman poem. It's no good, but it was the first of its type." Shockingly, this is arguably Lewis' most gruesome, with the gore factors dropping noticeably with follow-ups Two Thousand Maniacs! (1964) and Color Me Blood Red (1965) (now dubbed The Gore Trilogy). At only 67 minutes, this still tries the patience, and has more plot holes than I care to mention (maybe to stop the killings, someone should have told Ramses that Ishtar is a Babylonian goddess!), but its historical significance has cemented it's place in horror history.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After reading about this movie for 25 years, I've finally watched Herschell Gordon Lewis' first gore film, Blood Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A month ago, I went to a local video store that was selling all of it's VHS tapes and purchased several of them of which this was one. Now that I've seen the first of Herschell Gordon Lewis' gore pics, I'm a happy man! Happy in that I've finally viewed this and that it's as amateurish as I'd expected. I mean the way the actors do the lines is soooo slow-paced, you'd probably fall asleep if there weren't all those scenes of blood-splattered female victims around that keep popping up! I did like some of the intentionally funny scenes like when that caterer was hypnotizing that society woman at his store talking like they're possessed before snapping back to order or when that same caterer had some trouble convincing her daughter to stay lying down as he tries to kill her. But there were also some unintentionally hilarious ones like the way that boy on the beach was crying in some kind of pattern or when those cops was at a hospital commenting how one victim wasn't dead but now was. There was also a slightly creepy vibe concerning that daughter and that cop in a car at night though since I now know that they were played by eventual wife and husband team of Connie Mason and William Kerwin (billed as Thomas Wood here), it's only less so. Oh, and that organ music by Mr. Lewis was very dated to me. In summation, Blood Feast's amateurish shows throughout but was still pretty entertaining concerning some shocks and some comedy, whether intentional or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll never look at Egyptian catering the same way ever again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first gore film ever made, has an rich lady seeking a middle aged, exotic Egyptian caterer named FUAD RAMSES, to prepare an exotic Egyptian feast, one never prepared for thousands of years since the days of the Egyptian goddess ISHTAR, for her daughter Suzette's, 21st birthday party. Fuad begins hunting for the necessary ingredients for the feast, by stalking &amp; killing beautiful women before chopping &amp; removing certain parts from their bodies (legs, arms, guts, brains you get the picture) to cook them &amp; then intends to sacrifice Suzette as well to the gold idol of Ishtar he has stored in the kitchen of his restaurant. With two cops hot on his trail, they attempt to stop Fuad's reign of terror, or will Suzette suffer the same fate of many women centuries ago, by becoming the first victim in many centuries to be sacrificed to Ishtar? BLOOD FEAST is a film I have wanted to see for many years, mainly because my curiosity was picked when I heard it was the first gore film ever made. I heard it was pretty terrible as well, but I didn't care, I had to see this! &amp; after viewing the film I agree with a lot of people, this film is terrible! the acting is the worst ever put on film! Just imagine if you will, a person in your family that you know beyond a shadow of a doubt would make a truly diabolical actor &amp; then see this movie, trust me, the person that just came to your mind would be a real Oscar winner compared to these people &amp; the sad part is when things like that are usually said by most reviewers, they don't really mean it, but here I am deadly serious! The scene in the hospital is a good example of bad acting, when a cop asks a horribly disfigured girl some questions, when she responds to his questions, it sounds like she's making love! &amp; I swear to you when I say this (even the director has stated this at festivals &amp; during interviews) that the actor playing the doctor was so horrible &amp; couldn't remember his lines, that they gave him cue cards to read from! The direction is almost as atrocious &amp; the dialogue is just plain flat out bad &amp; really funny, even when it wasn't supposed to be. The film is mercifully short, so it's not that hard to take &amp; despite it's own terribleness, it's actually cut above most horror films that attempt to be serious (NIGHT OF HORROR, HOWLING 7, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES &amp; WHITE DOG SACRIFICE, SHE CREATURE (2001) comes to mind) Plenty of good gory moments, should help wet the appetites of gore hounds &amp; actually makes the film easier to swallow. In short, despite how horrible this movie actually is, I really can't give this a full on negative review &amp; a zero star rating (which I give to really bad films) simply because the film is so bad, it's actually fairly entertaining in a PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE sort of way. As it is, I'll give it a two star rating (which I give to films that are mediocre &amp; are saved from lower ratings due to it having a few things to help it rise above most films) in this films case, it's the gore &amp; unintentional laughs that can be had by watching really bad actors mumble off even worse dialogue. Followed by a sequel, 39 years later! BLOOD FEAST 2: ALL U CAN EAT! ** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By any technical standards, this is a horrible film. One-dimensional characters, even worse writing and acting, and an absolutely moronic plot. However, this is a legendary cult film for one simple reason. It is the first splatter film, the first horror film to feature an abundance of over-the-top and realistic gore. Sure, other drive-in films feature brief moments of gore ("The Brain That Wouldn't Die", "The Flesh Eaters", "Fiend Without a Face"). This was the first film to feature consistently graphic gore, with the opening bathtub scene pretty much setting the atmosphere to follow. For this reason alone, this is a must-see for all fans of psychotronic cinema.The plot (as if one mattered) is about an Egyptian caterer who kidnaps young girls and chops up their body parts for some dead Egyptian queen, so she can return to life. He is hired to do his services for an engagement party. He than plans to use the bride as his final sacrifice.For all its technical limitations, the film actually becomes quite comical. The acting is terrible but over-the-top and campy. The delivery of the dialog is also priceless (including the legendary line "Have you ever had an Egyptian FEAST?"). The camera-work is in the style of bad day-time soaps due to obvious budget limitations. However, H.G. Lewis wasn't a completely incompetent director and obviously had a very sick sense of humor. Also, the gore effects are surprisingly effective (and must've been even more so during the original release). For it's cinematic importance (for better or worse) and its hilarity, this is recommended to cult-film fans. Art-house snobs need not apply. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happen to think that "Blood Feast" is one of the most silliest horror films that I have ever seen.It is corny and unscary but that is the whole point for the film.The way this film was directed,this is the way that Herschell Gordon Lewis wanted this film to be.I have tried watching other films that were were directed by this man and each of his films are so campy,I felt compelled to either laugh at the movie or laugh at myself for renting them.Even though I think that "Blood Feast" is one of the worst films I have seen,I ask you fans of Herschell Gordon Lewis not to hang a noose around my neck yet.I also have some positive things to say about the director and this film.This film belongs in horror film history not for being so bad but for being so daring in its attempt to shock the audience.This is the first gore film.Remember,this was back in 1963 and there was never a film like this before.Herschell Gordon Lewis took a film and shoved in our faces and said I want you to feel like you are feeling now.He made this film to challenge us.Personally to me "Blood Feast" is so corny that it's a cult classic.I am being to hard on Herschell Gordon Lewis.The film itself is a failed attempt at what we expect to see in horror films but I accept that.Even though I already mentioned that this is one of the worst,I also have some respect for this film because of its challenge.The film challenged those who watched this film to take what was shown and it challenges others today too.This is why "Blood Feast" is a cult classic.OK,maybe this is not one of the worst but it's still bad.So bad,it's good.But not good.Well,you know what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>H.G. Lewis' Masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some gorehounds pay tribute to the man who created this film, Herschell Gordon Lewis, as having birthed the gore film genre. No doubt, Blood Feast was one of the earliest films to portray on-screen violence in graphic terms and, therefore, must've been considered quite a shocker when it was released in 1963. However, with the passage of time, this film looks more and more dated, and less and less inspired. Actually, H.G. Lewis was inspired more by the dollar sign than anything else to make this film. He was in it to make a quick buck. The film is shot in b/w and is amateurishly made, dubbed, and acted, all on the cheap. There is gore, but they are horribly shot and poorly staged. The story is pretty ridiculous, with H.G. Lewis trying to add a bit of ancient, Egyptian, religious mumbo-jumbo into what is your standard killer-on-the-prowl storyline to make it more interesting.A luke-warm recommendation for those gorehounds who must watch every gore film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.G. Lewis, a now semi-retired advertising exectutive, was the exectutioner of this film back in the early sixties. He was looking for a new method of exploitation film, and with his partner David Friedman, came up with the "gore film": A series of gross-out scenes, mostly violent and with scantily clad women, and a threadbare plot. This film fits all those obligations, and the blood is plentiful.And so is the bad acting. The acting, especially by Arnold as the bad guy caterer, is so overwrought, it makes drama class at high school look restrained. And the pace is so plodding, that the violence seems more like a looped bit of pornography than it does actually part of the plot. WHAT AM I SAYING? What plot? It all has something to do with an evil Egyptian caterer putting together a sacrificial cannibal feast, and all the parts he's collecting are from young women. OF COURSE.But don't let my opinions spoil this. BLOOD FEAST is so delerious in its humor, that even H.G. Lewis gets a big smile on his face when an interviewer brings it up. If you are a horror or splatter film fan, THIS IS A CLASSIC. For all others, be warned THIS IS BAD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hershell Gordon Lewis has been a personal hero of mine since that day so many years ago when I had the pleasure to experience Blood Feast for the first time. I think that the film, which has so often been cited as the prototype "gore" movie, has been unfairly characterized as abominable in all phases of production. This is simply not so. While Tom Wood and Connie Mason certainly leave a great deal to be desired in the acting department, they still manage to be perfect in their roles. Special mention should be made of the brilliant Mal Arnold, whose sociopathic Egyptian cannibal caterer is one of cinema's most original and memorable killers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is possibly the worst Movie to ever get a HIGH RECOMMENDATION. Worst because of the abysmal Acting and obvious obliteration of any attempt to construct a work of any socially redeeming value. BUT... here is the but. The Film was released to an unsuspecting Public and played without restraint in Main Street Theaters in Small Town America. Shot in a week or so on a budget of none, this was the first Gore Film. It was not only the first Gore Film, it was a Gorefest stylistically worthy of Romero, et.al. The aforementioned Ultra-Violence, shot in a rich color process, was and is fantastically effective. The Movie was so far ahead of its Time that nothing remotely resembling it appeared for Years. Clunky, stagy, over-the-top and shamelessly subversive, this Film is true to the definitive definition of a CULT CLASSIC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inept rubbish or cult classic? You decide.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Depending on what angle you come at Blood Feast, it's either a one-star dog or a ten-star masterpiece. One star if you're looking for a film with an intelligent script, strong acting, atmospheric scoring, genuine suspense and powerful shocks. Ten stars if you're looking for cult campiness on a grand scale or a film which single-handedly invents a new genre. The genre busily being created is the gore/splatter genre? some might argue that the earlier Hammer horrors were the first true gore flicks, or perhaps The Monster Of Piedras Blancas with its infamous severed head scene. But in truth, those films were just a bit bloodier and more daring than what people were accustomed to. Blood Feast is an altogether different beast, for this is a true gore film ? by which I mean that entrails are exposed, a tongue is torn out, an eye is stabbed out, limbs are severed and bodies are mutilated. Through modern eyes none of it looks terribly real, but at the time this took on-screen carnage to a whole new level.Egyptian caterer Faud Ramses (Mal Arnold) is asked to prepare a banquet for the birthday of pretty young student Suzette (Connie Mason). He tells Connie's mother that he will create an authentic Ancient Egyptian banquet, the likes of which hasn't been seen for 5000 years. What she doesn't realise is that he intends to serve up a genuine "Blood Feast", which is a cannibalistic meal comprising of the cooked organs and body parts of human beings. Ramses is responsible for a series of gruesome murders, each victim being a young woman who has had part of her anatomy removed by the demented killer. Apparently the whole feast is somehow supposed to resurrect the Ancient goddess Ishtar, or so Ramses believes. Suzette's slow-witted boyfriend Pete (William Kerwin) is the cop working on the case; will he piece together the clues before his girlfriend becomes the murderer's next victim? In most aspects Blood Feast is a truly inept film. Director Herschell Gordon Lewis subsequently hid behind claims that the film was intended as some kind of black comedy, but the reality of the matter is that there isn't much that's terribly funny here. The gore is everything really ? there's certainly nothing to get excited about in other departments. Mason's performance ranks amongst the most amateurish seen in any movie, ever. The music consists of random notes bashed out on what sounds like a church organ, and bears no relationship to events on screen. The story is riddled with stupid logic holes (like the fact that the killer drags his heel due to a limp, and leaves a trail of tell-tale footprints when he carries out one particular murder at the beach?. yet the cops keep insisting that he's some kind of criminal genius who never leaves them a single clue!!!) The list of flaws is endless and could take up several pages?. but why bother? The gore's the thing, and if you're looking for the original inspiration for all those mad slasher flicks then Herschell Gordon Lewis's inept classic Blood Feast is the place to start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this gore classic and truly be "appalled"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In director Herschell Gordon Lewis's own words, his landmark gore film may not be anything exactly "good", but it is a trailblazer and it does command a certain amount of respect. Lewis, or HGL as he is affectionately also known, and his filmmaking partner, David F. Friedman, realized they needed to move away from the "nudie cuties" that they'd already made and find a new element to exploit. And, man, did they find it. The now legendary "Blood Feast" features ingredients that would make his subsequent efforts identifiable, such as the hilarious bad acting, the tacky, bright &amp; colourful effects, and the dark humour.The story concerns a mad caterer, Fuad Ramses (Mal Arnold, playing the role with hysterical eye popping gusto), intent on creating a feast to honour his god Ishtar and using human body parts as part of the process. The detectives on the case are just about useless; meanwhile, Ramses is hired to cater the birthday party for local gal Suzette Fremont (Connie Mason, Playboy Playmate of the month, June 1963), so will Suzette be his ultimate victim or will her detective boyfriend Pete Thornton (William Kerwin, billed as Thomas Wood) figure everything out in time?As the awesomeness that is "Blood Feast" plays out, we are treated to such things as limb amputation, tongue &amp; brain removal, and flagellation - all done in loving close up for the camera. The atmospheric music, done by Lewis himself (he served as the cinematographer as well) is a hoot, with those drums pounding away and those violins and organs creating priceless accompaniment. Among the thespians robbed at Oscar time include Lyn Bolton as Suzette's hat loving mom Dorothy, Scott H. Hall as the police captain (you can actually see him reading his lines on camera), and especially Gene Courtier as the grieving boyfriend on the beach. That's emoting at its finest! Mason is much more notable for her looks than her acting, but given her looks, who wants to complain? Kerwin is likable as the one guy with presumably at least half a brain in his head, and Arnold is extremely memorable. "Have you ever had...an Egyptian FEAST?"The immense success of the movie, due in no small part to Friedman's marketing genius (including the distribution of vomit bags at showings, and insuring interest by obtaining an injunction against the film in Sarasota, Florida), and led to more of the same for HGL: "Two Thousand Maniacs!" and "Colour Me Blood Red", rounding out the "Blood Trilogy", as well as "The Gruesome Twosome", "The Wizard of Gore", and "The Gore Gore Girls".His work is all recommended, but "Blood Feast" is the perfect place to start for fans eager to check out the horror &amp; exploitation films of yesteryear.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I initially saw this movie because I have been a HUGE fan of The Misfits since I was 14 and immediately sought out every movie they had based a song upon if I had yet to see it. I feel the need to preface this by saying I actually do like Mr. Gordon Lewis and quite a few of his films. I got to meet him once at a horror punk show where he did an odd little Q&amp;A with the audience and was quite funny. However, this movie is LAUGHABLY bad. The lyric in the 'fits song goes "and that blood is so real, cause you just can't fake it"; which I'm convinced Glenn thought was hilarious since the 'blood' in the film ( and others) is ACTUAL red paint. It's a sub-standard and pretty awful z grade film, but this movie alone isn't what earned him the moniker of the godfather of gore; and you have to understand that no one back in those days even attempted to show anything that represented guts. I suggest you see some of his other works before judging the man on this film alone. And listen to the Misfits song if you haven't already. Mr. Lewis - I salute you.</fullReview>

The main problem with Blood Feast is there is an awful lot of boring dialog to sit through even at 67 Minutes,it takes away it's Schlock kinda charm,nor did I find it to be that gory. It did have a fair amount of blood yes but it's very dated by today's standards. The hilarious score for the film often cracked me up,it felt like one of those Cheapie type scores you randomly come up with while playing the piano. Apparently Mr.Lewis has quite the following with a few of his Gore films,to be honest this is the 1st one i've seen and to be quite frank I didn't care much at all for it. The ending was amusing I must admit the cheap little chase scene they filmed,a clever little ending helped a little bit,but this is pretty much standard b movie Horror schlock,with not much going for it.Bottom Line. Blood Feast Doesen't come with much of a recommendation from me,it Doesen't have enough charm to be an enjoyable low budget horror film,if they cut out some pointless dialog,then maybe..just maybe this would've been tolerable,unfortunately they Didn't..hopefully Mr.Gordon's other work is better then this turkey. I Know I usually write longer reviews then this,but to be honest I really don't feel the need to say a whole lot about this film,it is what it is.1 1/2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing So Appalling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are so bad that their flaws are the only things they have to recommend them, and the amount of pain and confusion they cause are the only way to rate them. On that scale, Blood Feast is, indeed, a truly great film.Blood Feast is the story of Fuad Ramses, a wild-eyed Egyptian caterer and Ishtar-worshiper, who is obsessed with reenacting a bloody, cannibalistic ritual in her honor. He gets his opportunity when a society matron hires him to cater a party for her daughter, Suzette. She wants something "special," and you know, nothing says special like dishes made from the body parts of beautiful young women.But plot is the least of our worries. We're in a virtual funhouse of bad film-making, with a new wonder at every turn. For instance - whose idea is the Egyptian feast, anyway? Fuad brings it up first, and Society Mom declares it "perfect," since Suzette is studying Egyptian culture. Later, though, SocMom marvels at the "coincidence" of party theme and course subject, as if it never occurred to her before. Even later conversations make it sound like the whole thing was SocMom's idea in the first place.Other nifty details - scenes with various characters are edited apparently to spread them evenly throughout the film, with no consideration as to when they must have occurred relative to each other. The actor playing the boyfriend of one of the victims puts on the most extraordinary displays of wretched overacting I've ever seen when he wails about how his girlfriend's death is all his fault. And the weirdly-printed curtain in the background of the hospital scene? I bet you won't be able to stop staring at it.Of course, there's plenty of early, grindhouse-era gore effects. Gallons of fake blood get mixed with assorted scraps of meat and gristle to surprisingly good effect. After all, you can't help but look fairly authentic if, when you tear a character's tongue out, you use a REAL TONGUE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing, but only for historical purposes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's been said that 'Blood Feast' was the first gore movie of all time. I'm not going to dispute that, as I haven't seen any before its release date of 1963. What can not be disputed by anybody is that the film had an incredible influence on the horror/gore/cult film genre.That's admirable. Without 'Blood Feast' and the other early gore films of HG Lewis, we may not have had the great movies by the likes of Romero, Argento and Fulci, and those are some of the best horror films of all time.However, other than the gore, 'Blood Feast' really has nothing going for it as far as I'm concerned. The storyline involves an Egyptian man who believes in an ancient cult and goes around killing young women and the police force's efforts to catch the killer. That's the whole story.Quite often an absence of a storyline and bad acting can help, not hinder a film, as seen in another cult classic released just two years after 'Blood Feast', 'Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'.In conclusion, basically, if you are a fan of the horror genre or cult films in general, 'Blood Feast' is worth checking out, just to see where it all began, but it doesn't stand up to the standards to any of the classic or cult horror movies that it has influenced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood Appetizer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hershell Gordon Lewis cheats his audience out of a satisfyingly cannibalistic conclusion in this positively Ed Woodian gore-fest, which seems much tamer now than it used to. My title: "Blood Appetizer".Then again, at least it isn't Lewis' "Monster A Go-Go". Shudder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No one said the origin of gore had to be interesting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the box set for the Blood Trilogy (Blood Feast, 2,000 Maniacs, Color Me Blood Red) on the shelf of the Best Buy that I work at. I got an awesome employee discount on the retail price of the set and decided to take it home and watch it. I love horror movies and B-films and was interested to see the origin of gore (or so the box said)So here I am writing about Blood Feast, supposedly one of the first, if not the first, gore movie ever made. Now, while horror movies in the 60's were mainly monster films like Frankenstein and so forth, I suppose you could call this a breathe of fresh air for the genre. But one thing: it's a bad movie. The plot is there, and the acting is so-so, but this 67 min. film is going to feel like forever. Here's the thing people need to remember about this film: Just because you can show gore, doesn't make the movie effective or interesting.Yes, the gore was good and the blood and everything was staged quite well. But the story, while intact, was lacking. I can see that if this was set out to be an full out exploitation film how it might garner a pardon for the lack of plot, but since it's mainly a stab at a different type of horror flick, I don't give it as much credit as others. In closing, interesting to see where gore films started, but a bit boring never-the-less. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ed Wood was not alone in his total ineptitude as a filmmaker.H.G. Lewis was every bit as bad.This is such a lurid piece of crapola(I don't what kind of film stock they used,but it involved a kool-aid emulsifier of some kind-everything has a cartoonish,unearthly,almost radioactive glow to it-I'm sure the stuff cost next to nothing,for color film).If you've got a taste for the superbad,this one's got it all!!Oh,yes,I'd almost forgotten..there's a 10-line minimum on these comments-I've never understood that,but..anyhow,here's some recommendations for anyone who got a chuck out of this movie:Plan 9 From Outer Space,Night Of The Ghouls,Andy Warhol's Dracula/Andy Warhol's Frankenstein(both of which are played for laughs,but are ridiculous nonetheless).Other titles escape me,but..hey,wait,is that 10 lines??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 50's there was Ed Wood. The 60's had Herschell Gordon Lewis. This almost legendary bad film was one of the first films to feature graphic violence on screen. The plot is about a madman who butchers up women in order to try to bring back to life an ancient goddess. Shoddy camera work, poor picture quality, inane script and horrible dialogue are just a few of the film's charms. Just keep in mind it is supposed to be this bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early horror gore film which has a certain charm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman taking a bath is stabbed in the eye by mad Egyptian cultist Fuad Ramses (Mal Arnold) who runs a shop called 'Fuad Ramses exotic caterer'. He then cuts her leg off with a machete, the water in the bath remains remarkably blood free, he puts her leg in a bag and leaves. Detective Pete Thornton (Thomas Wood or William Kerwin, whatever his real name is) and his Captain, Frank (Scott H. Hall) are both baffled by a series of brutal murders of young women who have each had a body part removed. Unfortunately these guys aren't too bright and claim they don't have any clues as to who the killer is, even though Ramses commits his crimes without gloves and in broad daylight. Mrs. Dorothy Fremont (Lyn Bolton) visits Ramses shop and hires him to prepare the food for a special party for her daughter Suzette (Connie Mason). More victims turn up, a girl on a beach has her brains removed, while another unwilling donor has her tongue torn out. The police (all two of them!) are still totally clueless and baffled. Ramses plans to resurrect an ancient Egyptian goddess named 'Ishtar'. As his plan nears completion he needs one final willing sacrifice, and guess what? Who better than pretty, young Suzette?! Her only hope is that the police stop him before he can conduct his ritualistic 'Blood Feast'!Directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis on his usual budget of next to nothing. Blood Feast is commonly regarded as the first 'gore' film ever made. That may be so but it doesn't make it any good, does it? Poor in just about every department, the acting is all over the place. Either people are just plain awful or overact like mad, Thomas Wood's surname sums up his acting style very well! Scott H. Hall, Connie Mason and the guy from the beach whose girlfriend had her brains hacked out are just plain terrible. Mal Arnold as Ramses overacts wildly, staring into the camera and delivering his lines like you won't believe. You really have to see these performances to believe them. Photography, sets, sound, music and special effects are all poor. Talking of the effects there's plenty of them, their fun in a bad way, but not very convincing. The tongue Ramses pulls out of one victims mouth is about a foot long! The script by Allison Louise Downe is at least pacey and thankfully short, the film clocks in at a modest 67 minutes. There is also a great line at the end which I loved, after Ramses is killed in a waste disposal truck Frank the police Captain says "he died a fitting death for the garbage he was!". These cops are the most stupid in film history, or at least they come very close. Their logic and thought process in regard to the murders and trying to solve them is absolutely hilarious. These films hold a certain fascination for horror fans like myself but are very difficult to recommend to casual viewers, but I did have some fun watching it, and it has a certain silly, goofy and almost innocent charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful, Amateurish Trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may well be the worst picture ever made.For those of you who don't know, the plot involves a loony Egyptian caterer who must prepare the titular Blood Feast for the goddess Ishtar.Unfortunately for the nubile young women who live in the area, the "Feast" consists of their body parts.He's an enterprising psycho and goes about the town killing, butchering and dismembering the young women.There is not one aspect of this film that is not atrocious (maybe with the exception of the cinematography which is barely adequate.) The script is inane and the actors are the worst I have ever seen.Director Herschell Gordon Lewis makes Ed Wood seem like Cecil B. DeMille in comparison.This film isn't one of the so-bad-it's-good bad films.No, it's just bad, bad, bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first unsavoury course in H.G. Lewis's 'Blood Trilogy'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blood Feast stars Mal Arnold as mad, murderous maniac Fuad Ramses, a man who is clearly evil from the ridiculous size of his eyebrows, his lame leg, his menacing glower, and the completely malevolent manner in which he rubs his hands together. But although he's the last guy in the world you or I would trust as a caterer, Mrs. Dorothy Fremont (Lyn Bolton) is only too happy to let him prepare the food for her daughter Suzette's dinner party, and seems genuinely surprised when she discovers that the crazy Egyptian's ancient feast consists of human body parts, and that poor Suzette (Connie Mason) is intended to be the final ingredient.As the first ever 'splatter' movie, H. G. Lewis's Blood Feast is an undeniably important entry in the annals of horror cinema, ushering in a new, much bloodier era for the genre; but although it is certainly a taboo shattering and highly influential film, the fact remains that it is also a dreadfully amateurish and rather tiresome effort?one that even the director himself admits was far from great: 'It was no damn good', he has said of the film, 'but it was the first of its kind'.Not only does the film feature some of the crappiest acting in movie history (Lyn Bolton deservedly receives flak for her awful performance, but I reckon Gene Courtier, as a victim's distraught boyfriend, is even worse: he looks like he's laughing!), but the direction is also extremely dull (with constant use of overlong static shots), and the music is abysmal. Even the film's major selling point?the ground-breaking gore?fails to impress, consisting of an unconvincing collection of mannequin limbs coated with red paint and liberally scattered with offal.On top of all that, we also get a supposed ancient Egyptian female sacrifice bearing bikini tan marks, an Egyptian themed dinner party for which no one dresses appropriately and which features absolutely no decoration, and a laughable finale in which Fuad, pursued by Suzette's policeman boyfriend Pete Thornton (William Kerwin), climbs into the back of a garbage truck and is immediately crushed to death.Since 1963, Lewis's admittedly intriguing premise has been dealt with several times: in the enjoyable trashy horror flick Mardi Gras Massacre (1978), awful unofficial sequel Blood Diner (1987), and most recently, in Lewis' own follow up, Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat (2002).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Gore, Bad Everything Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herschell Gordon Lewis of "Gore Gore Girls" and "Wizard of Gore" fame directs the first gore film ever. This film is highly inferior to its sequel "Two Thousand Maniacs." However, every fan of the genre should make time to see this film.There are no good performances and the story is so over the top that you have to laugh. The gore, on the other hand, is great. Severed tongues, legs, brains and everything else make this movie OK to watch. It's hard to believe that the gore genre started with such an awful movie. I suffered through much of the story.My review probably hasn't given you much motivation but if you are an exploitation fan, you owe it to yourself to see this film. I hope you can find it for cheap!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies just make you say "who cares", you know? Sure, it was the first gore movie, but like others have said, no that dosen't make it a good movie. It's actually one of the most boring things I've ever seen. I tried to have an open mind, but it kept boring me over and over and over..... This movie was not made to be good we know.. it was just made for the director to get rich.. and over this I hope he didn't.. We can't owe gore movies to this.. Someone else would have come along and made one if he didn't.. and it probably would have been better. So, once again, who cares, don't rent it just because it 'started it all'.</fullReview>

Bad acting, excessive effects (Pure red), stupid script and bad, really bad camera work completes this, now, cult film for being one, if not the first, that start the gore mood. Stands out the color (Named as Bloodcolor here) and, if we must say something good, Kerwin is the only capable of anything. Brings laughs for it's campness, but is really an awful film. Gene Courtier is - of course - Tony, the boy on the beach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very first gore film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and one of the worst. It's about some guy killing women and taking various body parts of them, to make some "feast" to an Egyptian god. We see an eye gouged out, a tongue removed, a brain, a whipping...all shot in lingering close-up in bright, brilliant color. This movie is a total piece of garbage...it can only be enjoyed on a camp level. The story is vague (and stupid); ALL the acting is atrocious; the dialogue horrendous; the camera-work hilariously bad...hell, there's NOTHING good in this film! The gore effects are somewhat realistic and there is tons of blood. Also, the killings are kind of uncomfortable to watch...the filmmakers seem to enjoy showing all this blood and gore. But, more often than not, it's a laugh riot. One last time--I can't stress how bad the acting is in this film. This is a textbook example of how NOT to act!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst acted film in history!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The same night I saw BLOOD FEAST, I also saw another of director Hershell Gordon Lewis' films, TWO THOUSAND MANIACS (which turned out to be a pretty good film). So the fact that I gave one of these films a positive review is ample evidence that I haven't got a grudge against his films and his very low-budget style. Heck, it's possible to make a decent film on a shoestring budget, as films like CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962) and VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960) were amazingly good films despite the low production values. In light of this and the over 5400 movies I have reviewed, it says a lot when I declare that BLOOD FEAST has the worst acting I have ever seen--and I have seen SANTA CLAUS VERSUS THE MARTIANS, ROBOT MONSTER and THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS!! The film is about a homicidal maniac that rips women apart to appease his sick goddess. Ostensibly, she is an Egyptian goddess, though everything about her, the cannibalism and history of Egypt is pure crap and seems to come from Lewis' fertile imagination. But, with a title like BLOOD FEAST, this is a minor consideration to say the least! The real star of the film is the gore and I have to admit that for a film from 1963, the gore is exceptionally realistic. Sure they make gorier films today with top-notch effects, but for 1963 it was groundbreaking AND the blood looked much more realistic than other films of the era.So if the film was so important to the history of gore films, why does it still earn a 1? After all, the effects weren't bad. Well, let's get back to the acting. It was worse than any high school production I have seen--and I know what I am talking about since I teach in a high school and have seen at least a dozen productions. Any of the kids at my school could have acted circles around the bozos who appeared in BLOOD FEAST. Many of the "actors" had difficulty reading their lines and each time they were required to show emotion it was frankly hilarious! In particular, the time the guy is attacked and his girlfriend is murdered is bad! When the cops tell him that she's dead, his emotional tirade is unintentionally comical! A bit later, when the victim's mother is told, she appears to be trying to hide her laughter when she "cries". It's bad,....real bad.Now the bad acting could be chalked up to the production values, but that would be a mistake. The "director" never seemed to re-shoot any scene no matter how badly botched and he seemed to do nothing to elicit anything resembling acting from the actors. Much of this is because when he should have been directing, Lewis was actually busy filming the picture and was too busy to offer any coaching or guidance. The fools just seemed like they were told to "act sad" and were left to wing it! I could talk more about the dopey plot and the actor who looked like a shorter version of Michael Richards who did all the killing, but frankly who cares?! The bottom line is that this film is every bit as bad as the worst of Ed Wood, Jr. and for fans of bad films that means this film is pure gold! To normal folks, though, watching this would probably be pretty tough going...like having surgery without anesthesia!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blood Feast (1963) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Cult classic was one of th first splatter films to be made. A strange and demented caterer gets a job hosting a party and decides to have an Egyptian feast, which needs dead women to complete. This is certainly a amateurish film and there's no question that the plot is about a thin as thin can get but that's okay because the film delivers what the title says. The movie was made for one thing and that one thing delivers. While the gore certainly isn't in the same league as the stuff of today, it is fun watching where it all started. I'm really not sure how many people will be entertained by this film today but it is a good nostalgia trip. Lewis goes all out with his creativity in trying new ways for people to get killed. We've got eyes being ripped out, legs being chopped off and even tongues being pulled out. The pacing of the film is a bit off as the movie seems overly long even at 67-minutes. This is certainly far from a classic but in the end the movie does a great job at showing gore and that's the reason to watch it.</fullReview>
