		<shortDescription>This may be the best film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the classic old tale of two men trying to construct an Egyptian goddess for their castrated uncle from the severed body parts of young women.This is one of those rare unknown cinema gems that reminds you of what 80's horror/slasher movies were all about and why video cameras were ever invented in the first place. It also contains the best movie line ever written: "On that night, on this mission, I lost my gentitals and my life." And yes, Uncle Anwar really says "gentitals".The plot of this movie is thrown together as loosely as the body parts used to construct Shiitar. The movie is lightly based on Blood Feast with some horrible special effects and 80's hairdos thrown in.There are more classic moments in Blood Diner than there are in most B horror movies combined. You'll be laughing all the way to the blood buffet from the weird stuffed talking dummy in the rival diner to the guy getting his head smashed by a car with hydraulics which causes an onlooker to ask "hey man, you OK?". The movie even has token 80's horror flick nudity when the brothers go into a topless aerobics class (don't ask why) and mow everyone down with a machine gun. Hey, it happens. Another epic scene is when a fat guy driving a van and listening to mambo music repeatedly runs over a dude in a failed yet hilarious attempt to kill him.If you haven't seen this movie I suggest you quit your job and study it for the next few months. You'll be swinging a meat cleaver screaming SHIIIIIITAAAAAAAR!!!!! before you know it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bad reviews of this movie infuriate me. Why the hell would anyone watch this an expect anything other than comedy, gore, and nudity. The movie scores on all three! Best plot ever: Evil brain of uncle sends psycho nephews on mission to kill naked women and collect pieces...oh and they run a diner that serves the leftovers. I consider this required viewing for any REAL horror fan.That's all I wanted to say but I need to do 10 lines here. This is not out on DVD yet but hopefully it will be someday. I recommend Night Train to Terror for the exact same reasons as this film. Also, here's line number 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best vegetarian restaurant in town.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael and George, owners of the best vegetarian restaurant in their small city, have an interesting social life. Where most people go home and spend time with their loved ones after work, Michael and George hang around with their deceased uncle. That's right, their deceased uncle -- who's actually just a brain and eyes in a jar that's ordering them to rebuild the goddess Sheetar so she can take over the world.Sound like the perfect B-Movie? Well, in a way, it is. 'Blood Diner' is one of those little gems that takes you quite a while to appreciate. Sure, it's filled with as much low budget gore and cheesy sexist jokes as as Kong could fit into an hour and twenty eight minutes. And sure, there are members of my high school drama class that are better actors than two of the main characters in this film. But that's what makes it fun -- the fact that it was not only made to laugh at, but that you have so many chances to laugh at it.Rent this movie if you ever get the chance and if you're into black humour and/or horrible but great films. And make sure to watch out for the biker, wrestling and Vitamin scenes. If you aren't rolling on the floor laughing at the end of it, never rent another B-Movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Blood Diner Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I played a zombie in BLOOD DINER and believe me when I tell you, it was such a bizarre and sickening experience that I plan to devote an entire chapter to the nightmare in my memoirs. I have worked on a lot of films, and I mean a LOT, and I can say with all confidence that the depravity of the project, inhuman working conditions and incompetence of the production have been unequaled, and will be fresh in my mind if I die of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 300.So many people walked off the set in the middle of production, that they ended up hiring homeless people and crackheads off the streets of Hollywood to fill in the ranks. They probably even gave some of them lines. Half of the female cast were literally called into casting on the basis of spreads in JUGGS magazine. The writer, who later became a good friend of mine (before I knew he had written the thing), had played Mengele in SURF Nazis MUST DIE (one of my favorite, and the most depraved of all Troma films).Jimmy Maslon, the producer, has a reputation as one of the cheapest and most thoughtless coke-head producers in Hollywood (he forgot to feed the zombies on so many occasions, that to keep the rest of us from walking off one day, he ran to the store and bought us some generic white bread and baloney, from which we made our own sandwiches).And don't get me started about Jackie Kong. "The Dragon Lady," as she was known to all who worked with her, will have a special mention in the book.Suffice to say, that she once spent six hours on a 2 minute dialogue scene, while her zombies were sitting around in cheap gel make-up, which had completely melted off our faces by the time we got around to our scenes.All that said, it actually is a pretty funny movie. I don't think any of the actors realized it was going to be though. In fact, I don't think anybody did but the zombies, who were all wasted on weed and CLUB margaritas the whole time -hic- ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the wackiest horror flicks you will ever find. It is rare and difficult to locate a copy but it is well worth the search especially for true horror buffs or those who have a penchant for the truly shocking and bizarre. "Blood Diner" is actually a salute to Herschell Gordon Lewis' "Blood Feast" it is not however a blatant rip-off. While a handful of scenes are similar to those in "Blood Feast" there are no blatant scene-for-scene rip-offs in this one and true fans of Lewis' will appreciate the tribute! The murder sequences in this film are exceptionally goofy and side-splittingly funny. From the french-fried "lady fingers" to the pickled uncle's brain in a jar (complete with eyes) that talks all the way down to the deep-fried prostitute and the woman who is literally hacked in two, not horizontally but vertically. There are plenty of shocks and laughs in this film but a warning: it is most definitely not for the squeamish so grab a barf bag and get ready for a bloody good time at the "Blood Diner"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did you all expect this to be a serious film? Honestly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviews of this movie honestly befuddle me to no end. The only way the movie could be rated this low by so many people, is that somehow, for some reason, they were expecting a serious film of some sort or another. Assuming the title itself didn't give them a rather obvious clue that this was to be a Herschell Gordon Lewis homage. And if they were..... well, if the first 5 minutes of the movie didn't serve them notice that they were dealing with a movie reveling in a flamboyant sense of camp and bad taste, then perhaps they would have been better off watching some pretentious art film. 'Twould serve them right for taking themselves sooooo very, very seriously.This movie is a cheaply made gore fest, masquerading as a comedy, no excuses. Not that that's a bad thing, mind you. Sort of Grand Guignol in fish net stockings and garters. Evoking screams even as you laugh at it's over the top absurdity. Is it for all tastes? No, certainly not. But at what it tries to do, it succeeds at, for the most part. For me, at least, the movie struck a delicate balance between horror and comedy, two extremes that are fairly difficult to make work very effectively together, though it must be said, it succeeded far better with the latter than the former.If you liked this genre (splatter comedies.... a rather narrow genre of film-making, to say the least), check out any one of the following, 2001 Maniacs, Frankenhooker, Psychos In Love, Bloodsucking Freaks, The Toxic Avenger, and Brain Damage. All cut from the same bolt of bloody cloth. And all equally worthwhile in their own way. Just try not to confuse any of them with Gandhi, okay? Class dismissed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorites! Rent this if you like horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a treasure. It's hilarious, it's gory, it's got a totally unique story line and some really great, memorable scenes. Who wouldn't want to see a cheerleader massacre? I ran into this film at a video store several years ago not knowing what to expect. SO glad I rented it because it's remained one of my favorite flicks ever since. Once in a while I run into other people who love BLOOD DINER as I do, and we all agree on the same points- and it really narrows down to that it's a horror fan's film. It's got all the best elements and really deserves more recognition. If you're a fan of the Evil Dead movies, early Carpenter and P. Jackson- any kind of quirky, off-beat horror you gotta love BLOOD DINER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore makes this watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What was the deal with the horror comedies from the late 80's? Movies like Evil Dead II, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Jason Lives, Sleepaway Camp II, etc. set the standards for slasher comedies but it was too late when these kind of flicks became popular. Dark sense of humor helped this movie to at least be remembered by some people.BLOOD DINER is a decent little gore flick. With no pretentions, a weak storyline, low budget, but with whacked characters, a weird humor, and lots of blood this is a must see for die hard fans of the genre.Watch it to witness the 80's madness. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember being intrigued by the box of this film for the longest time when I was young, yet for some reason being terrified to rent it. The image of the neon sign with the hand holding the large butcher knife scared me for some reason. However, like most horror films, I eventually got around to watching it; unfortunately, the film was nowhere near as terrifying as I imagine.First, it is important to realize that this film is definitely more comedy than horror. Granted, it is dark comedy with some gruesome murders thrown in, but still, the comedy outweighs the horror here. This is fine, as I have nothing against horror comedies--if they are done well. This one, however, is not. The premise should be slasher film gold, as the film centers around two psychotic brothers who run an isolated diner. They lure and kill young women in order to use them as a recipe for their various dishes. However, there is a subplot involving the brothers needing to make sacrifices to an long dead Egyptian queen that allows (or forces) the film to grapple with the comedic sub-plot that ultimately is the main downfall of the film. While the film sets up some creative and gory death scenes, they are played more for laughs than horror. The film tries too hard to be funny, and while fans of dark humor may be amused, horror fans will quickly become annoyed as the film ultimately drowns in its silliness.Maybe my sense of humor is askew, but I did not find this film particularly amusing. Surely, though, there will be those who will, and to them I say more power to you. However, for true horror fans, be warned that this film will more than likely do nothing but frustrate you, Sure, you may get a few chuckles, mainly because of the stupidity of what you are seeing, but if a few chuckles is what you are looking for, turn on an old episode or "Roseanne." You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore Du Jour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, quite frankly, I knew what the makers of this film were attempting to do: put together a horror-gore-spoof in the tradition of Herschell Gordon Lewis basically stealing much of his plot elements from Blood Feast. Two brothers dig up the brain of their dead uncle and then listen to him(it) tell them how to bring back an ancient goddess of evil. Naturally, a virgin and the body parts of tramps were needed for sacrifice and a blood buffet(movie definitely steers clear from using the word "feast"). The film succeeds with what it was trying to do, yet it is painfully far from a cinematic success. It is obvious the people involved in the film gave it their all, but the actors made me wince more than once with what they were doing. Now bad acting is a staple in a Lewis production, but the actors in this film consciously tried to be funny with a script that had few laughs. A couple moments made me smile: the biker guy and the kid in the truck with the mambo music, the policeman wearing clothes that no one probably ever wore, and the absurd dummy and ventriloquist diner cook. But the rest, the annoying brain and eyes in a glass jar that talked, the weird penchant for Hitler(used in a wrestler's name and two night club singers), the atrociously directed death scenes(the one with the batter was just soooo bad), and so much more. The acting leads really try way too hard to make something out of nothing(which is another name for the script used here!). Blood Diner is an obvious homage to Lewis and his style of film-making, but it is a rather trite, tiresome, and uneven spoof at best. Yes, there is gore and blood and body parts, but like any Lewis film it has not relation to reality at all. Nor will this film produce even a twinkling of a fright!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moronic horror comedy rubbish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blood Diner starts as youngsters George (Sir Rodenheaver) &amp; Michael Tutman (Roxanne Cybelle) witness their uncle Anwar (Drew Godderis) get shot by the police but not before he gives them an ancient Egyptian amulet belonging to evil God Sheetar. Twenty years later &amp; George (Carl Crew) &amp; Micheal (Rick Burks) run a successful vegetarian diner by day &amp; help their uncle Anwar's disembodied brain in a jar organise a 'blood buffet' in which they will resurrect Sheetar inside a stitched together body made from human parts from the people they murder, any left over parts are cooked &amp; served up in their diner. Local LAPD cops Mark Shepard (Roger Dauer) &amp; Sheba Jackson (LaNette La France) are on the case &amp; trying to figure out who is murdering &amp; dismembering pretty young girls...Co-produced &amp; directed by Jackie Kong one has to say that Blood Diner seems to divide opinion with those who love it's bizarreness, it's odd quirky sense of humour &amp; gore &amp; there are those like me who just think it's an idiotic piece of crap with no redeeming value. Originally envisioned as a sequel to the Herschell Gordon Lewis horror flick Blood Feast (1963) in which a guy tries to arrange an Egyptian 'blood feast' to resurrect an ancient Egyptian Goddess so both have similar stories although somebody decided Blood Diner should stand alone as a horror comedy in it's own right, it's just a shame they forgot to include any horror or comedy which could be considered a bit of an oversight. I have read plenty of review of Blood Diner that praise it for it's comedy but for the life of me I can't see anything funny here at all, the moronic lowbrow comedy like puking diner customers, talking brains in jars, bands dressed like Adlof Hitler, dumb one-liners &amp; people trying to drive with both their hands severed make the Police Academy films look sophisticated. The plot is meandering, the majority of what happens seems random like the makers were making it up as they went along, the character's are awful, the dialogue is poor &amp; even some blood &amp; naked breast's can't save it. Blood Diner is not a funny experience or a scary experience &amp; overall it didn't do anything for me.The whole film is very camp, silly &amp; at times surreal with a bizarre subplot about an Adolf Hitler impersonating wrestler (along with the Adolf Hitler band, do you notice a trend here?) &amp; a talking shop dummy who for no reason whatsoever seems to be alive despite being, well, a shop dummy. There's a fair amount of naked female cleavage on show including topless aerobics. The gore didn't impress me much &amp; I reckon the original Blood Feast is more excessive, there are a few body parts, a brain in a jar, some blood splatter, a guy has his hands cut off, there are a couple of decapitations, a head is crushed under a car tyre &amp; someone is cut in two. There are some zombies at the end too as well as Sheetar who has a huge mouth in her stomach for some reason. The film looks alright with some nice neon lit scenes but it still doesn't make it any more watchable. The one &amp; only time Blood Diner has ever been released here in the UK it had 3 minutes &amp; 53 seconds cut from it &amp; looking at an uncut version today I have no idea what those cuts could have been.The budget was probably reasonable &amp; it looks alright with decent production values &amp; it's a shame it didn't turn out better. The acting mostly be people who had never acted before or since making Blood Diner is pretty poor &amp; it's also interesting to note director Jackie Kong hasn't made another film since this either.Blood Diner is a moronic horror comedy that fails miserably on both counts &amp; just ends up being a random mess with an odd fixation for Adolf Hitler impersonators. Some seem to like it but I didn't &amp; the current lowly IMDb 'User Rating' of 3 probably gives a fairer idea of what the general opinion of people actually is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is as crass as 'Hobgoblins' and as obnoxious as 'The Demon Lover'. I thought I knew what to expect from it, like duh, the title puts "blood" and "diner" together! What could that be about? There is ample of gore all right, and there is girls showing full- frontals. There is even a living brain barking orders from a water tank. And that is normal business but the comedy of 'Blood Diner' isn't! The comedy is never funny, it's really sick, but nothing is ever "normal" about it! The entire logic is of a Looney Tunes cartoon. Crowds cheers when someone is smashed under a truck, a ventriloquist dummy is a living character for no apparent reason, and body parts and entrails are easily pulled off by hand! Finally crowds gathers to see a performing new-wave act, where the smug singer sports a purging candy-floss Elvis-do, and the six-man band are dressed identical as Adolf Hitlers! There is also a Hitler wrestler! What's up with Hitler?Is there a DVD with a director's commentary, that could possible be the really scary thing! What were they thinking?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Naked chick with hairy bush does karate!?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stand somewhere in the middle on Blood Diner (1987). It has everything I want from a B-grade horror flick. Tons of T&amp;A, really cheesy acting, a paper thin plot, over the top (almost comical) gore. But somehow it just can't shake it's cheap production values and almost retarded direction. Blood Diner was developed as a sequel to Blood Feast (1963) but ended up being a stand alone film with emphasis on comedy/dark humor. Anyone expecting a riveting, well acted film is obviously going to be let down. If you expect that kind of film from a movie titled "Blood Diner", then I hate you. Blood Diner is a cool flick to check out cause it features some really entertaining scenes. Such as a naked chick performing karate on her attacker, a topless aerobics class getting machined gun down, deep fried body parts, tons of 80's T&amp;A, and a talking brain with eyeballs. It's a cheesy film that doesn't try to be anything but outrageous and comedic. Blood Diner is best viewed under the influence of a few brewskies. Check it out for cheap but don't spend $ on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resurrection comedy horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror comedy. Now that's a tricky formula to pull off. Many have tried, few have succeeded. For every 'Shaun of the Dead' there's an 'An American Werewolf in Paris', know what I mean? This one gets it about half right.The plot is the purest nonsense - a mad scientist winds up disembodied, a brain in a jar if you will, and decides that the only thing to do is to construct a perfect female specimen in order to revive an ancient She-God who goes by the name of Sheetar. He enlists the help of a pair of cannibal locals, and the bits of the women they don't use go into the food at the diner they run, making their veggie burgers by far the best in town. Cue loads of ridiculous gore and general mayhem.There are some wonderfully odd moments; the naked woman who 'turns' - one minute victim, the next karate chopping avenger; the guitar playing Hitler's and the stomach with teeth, but there's also a fair amount of slapstick which is less welcome. A mixed bag, but far from rubbish and, in its own weird way, quite original.Enjoyable if flawed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overlooked 80's Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why this film has gotten such crappy reviews, but it is a very overlooked late 80's classic! This film is not to be taken very seriously, and I think that is what people do. They read the plot summary or back of a tape or DVD and always expect a serious, straight up horror flick. Well, most people should know by now that 80's b-horror films were not always so serious. In fact, most of them were not. It's all about the campy feel. That's what makes these movies fun to watch. They are just as entertaining with comedy as they are with blood and horror. You have to take it for what it is, not for what you want it to be! The beginning has one of my favorite quotes of all time. After the Mom leaves the two little brothers home alone to go to the market because she "ran out of goddamn tampons," a NEWS guy on the radio begins talking about a man on the loose. ...and I quote, "He is armed and dangerous and has been spotted in the West Side area armed with a meat cleaver in one hand and his genitals in the other." That amuses me. You have to hear it. Anyway, the guy turns out to be the little boys' uncle who was trying to resurrect an Egyptian Goddess. He ends up being shot to death by the cops, but not before he is able to give his two nephews sacred necklaces.Fast forward 20 years. The boys are grown up and ran a diner together. They dig up Uncle Anwar and remove his brain. He ends up in a jar with a pair of eyes attached to his brain so he can see. He also can talk! Don't ask me how. I never saw a mouth anywhere on the brain. So basically, the two brothers kill lots of young girls and cut them up into bits and pieces to put together a body that will become the Egyptian Goddess Shiitar (am I the only one who thought Shiitar was hot?). They also use the pieces to put into their food! Yummy! Great little movie here. It's full of body parts scattered everywhere, funny as hell, and just flat out entertaining even if the acting isn't so good. This is a great 80's b-horror film that is under appreciated by many. I wouldn't care to bet that half the people who left reviews didn't even watch the whole film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Problem of Horror-Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror-comedy is something very difficult to do. So many films tried this blend of genres in the 1980s and failed miserably: Ghoulies 3, TerrorVision, pretty much anything Troma ever did. And only a few truly brilliant filmmakers were able to really succeed at this: Frank Henenlotter, Peter Jackson, Dan O'Bannon. This film is rare in that it falls generally between these two extremes. It's often very funny, and occasionally creative, but its obvious self-awareness can sometimes be trying.Two brothers operate a vegetarian restaurant and secretly serve human flesh to their customers. They have an uncle (or what remains of him) who helps them to prepare for the feast of Sheetar by compiling a perfect woman out of assorted body parts. The bones of the plot are borrowed lovingly from H.G. Lewis's Blood Feast, but the majority of the film is pretty unique.Unfortunately, because of their similarities, Blood Diner will always be compared to Blood Feast, and Blood Diner is just not that caliber of a film. Blood Feast brought on the sickening and sometimes too-real gore; Blood Diner's gore is cartoonish and cheap-looking. Blood Feast was technically flawed, but had enthusiastic performances and unmindfully creative camera work; Blood Diner is slick (as far as 80s horror-comedies go) and very self-conscious, but ultimately soulless in its execution.The real key to a successful horror-comedy is that little dash of sincerity. You can have your jokes and fun, but a little sincere strangeness (or just plain scares) makes the film all the more real. If you like horror-comedy, and you've already seen Basket Case, Frankenhooker, Return of the Living Dead, Dead Alive, Re-Animator, and Brain Damage, you may want to give this a shot. It's sure as hell better than Troll 2.</fullReview>

I finally decided to watch it, and now I really wish I hadn't. It's honestly 90 minutes or so, I'll never get back, but that's the risk you take with movies. I couldn't get over how incredibly stupid this movie is. For starters, how is the Uncle managing to talk, despite being dead for many years, and only having a brain and penis? We get viewer discretion at the start, with a warning message that insists the stuff done in this movie, is performed by seasoned professionals. No kidding, Sherlock! Was that supposed to be cute? When it's not moving as slow as molasses, it does manage to be bloody. We get many severed limbs, evisceration, decapitation with a broom (Yes, seriously) and lots more. Too bad I was too bored to care. I expected the amateurish acting, but they didn't even manage to make this into a so bad, it's good movie. I'm not gonna mention the performances. Everyone is absolutely god awful. This was initially a sequel to Blood Feast, but they pulled away from that idea. At least Blood Feast was campy fun at times, this has none of thatFinal Thoughts: Avoid it like the plague. There is nothing worthwhile about this movie, nothing at all. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with this one, how this is not more of a well known movie is beyond me. That seems to be a thing with strange movies from the 80s, that just simply don't get enough exposure.You get plenty of kills, boobs, and a freaking talking brain! That takes phone calls, very strange thing.The effects are great and saying anything about the plot would honestly ruin it for you. The only real main issue I had with the film was the wrestling scene, I personally love WWE wrestling but this was a really boring and dull scene. Also near the end of the movie it jumps between so many characters its hard to keep track right where you are.If you love slasher flicks give it a go, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goofy 80s Horror Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just needed to clear up some things I have read in the reviews. First being Jackie Kong is a woman and secondly this is not a Troma film. This movie is an exercise in bad jokes. Most don't work at all, but set the tone . Initially intended as a sequel to H.G. Lewis' classic Blood Feast hence the similar name and plot. Two brothers watch as their uncle is killed by police officers shortly after a murder spree. Flash forward several years later and the boys are all grown up and digging up the remains of their uncle. After retrieving his eyes and his genitals they keep them in a jar in the back of their health food restaurant. From this point on the uncle's remains order the boys to gather female body parts to complete a feast needed to resurrect an ancient goddess whom they worship. The movie is in bad taste, but not done realistically enough to disturb or even classify as horror. There are body parts disguised as health food, dummies and nazi wrestlers all very over the top and in poor taste. Don't expect great acting, effects or dialogue, but it's still a fun little flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy/Horror movie made for doofuses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I love 80's horror flicks. Sometimes the cheesier, the better.This film takes cheesy 80's horror flick to a new level. The whole time through this movie, I was asking myself what the heck I was watching. It's about 2 clown brothers that are into black magic and want to bring an Egyptian goddess to life. She's far from a goddess though and why that's so important to these 2 brothers is beyond me. Oh I forgot to mention they are guided by their dead uncle's talking brain in a jar throughout the process. Just seems like a horror flick made for wacky doofuses. No offense to anyone who likes this. Just the vibe I get. I gave it 3 stars because it was entertaining enough to make it to the end. Barely though.I've seen my fair share of Troma films and even though this is not, it has that same vibe to it. There's one word to describe Troma films.....wacky. The one Troma film I'll make an exception to is Toxic Avenger.I guess watch this film if you want to poop in your pants and run around with a big smile on your face. If you find that entertaining, you will find this movie entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning! The truly unusual motion picture you are about to see contains many scenes of graphic violence. It is not intended for the faint of heart nor the young and impressionable. While it is a sad fact that mass homicide and practitioners of blood cults infest our society, the producers of this film wish to express that they do not condone, nor do they want to inspire, any of the human butchery or violence portrayed in this film. If you feel you will be offended by such material, please leave the theatre at once. Note: All of the mutilations, bodily dismemberments and cannibal rituals were performed by seasoned professionals. Please do not attempt any of these stunts at home. Thank you. - Opening narration.In 1963, Exploitation extraordinaire Herschell Gordon Lewis invented a brand new sub-genre of film that some 40 years on would become one of the most popular among American audiences, the Gore Film. There had been shocking violence in movies prior to this, but none that focused solely on providing the audience with graphic depictions of murder and mutilation in the way Lewis and this ground-breaking film Blood Feast did, and in starting colour to boot (those lucky enough like me to have the 1st edition of the rare paperback 'Herschell Gordon Lewis and his World of Exploitation Films' will know just how much of a censorship outcry this caused).There were legs sawn off, brains removed and tongues ripped out of beautiful women by an Egyptian caterer hoping to bring Ishtar, an ancient Goddess of good and evil back to life, and in 1987 Jackie Kong would make the seminal film's spiritual sequel; Blood Diner.This gloriously bonkers film presents us with Michael and George Tutman; your average American siblings who, being aided by their dead Uncles brain, set about getting the required 'parts' to complete his task of resurrecting five million year old Goddess Shitaar. The brothers also operate a health-food diner, with the secret ingredient in their vegetable patties being human meat (which renders it wrong on so many levels when a particularly energetic proprietor vomits all over another unsuspecting patron), and have to deal not only with the cops hot on their trail, but the owner of a rival diner desperately trying to attain the recipe for those tasty burgers. We're also provided with an appreciated amount of absolute randomness Kong decided to throw into the mix, such as a wrestling match involving the popular 'Jimmy Hitler,' a workout video like no other and a high-pitched character played by an incredibly unmoving actor? Blood Diner is unadulterated fan-boy beautiful ugliness, and you'll know by now if it's a movie you'll enjoy. I was first introduced to it by my old high school Student Executive teacher who rates it as his all-time favourite, and who helped form my opinion and enthusiasm for horror, being the first to recommend to me staples such as Umberto Lenzi's Cannibal Ferox (1981) and Romero's Day of the Dead. There are deep-fried heads, heads bitten off by carnivorous stomachs and this deformed classic is certainly at the head of the class when it comes to giddy entertainment.Cheers, Mr Clark.So if you've just missed the bus to Tromaville, or there is no vacancy at Motel Hell, why not stop by the Blood Diner? You'll have a killer time? just remember to take lots of serviettes.4 Blood Buffets out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordandandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A diner worth visiting, depending on your tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected this film to be an actual serious one. What I got wasn't what I expected, but still the same it was different. Two cannibalistic brothers open this new diner, their Uncle's brain, still functioning, is kept in a jar in the backroom. He was a knife wielding maniac shot at the film's start when taken refuge in the home of their nephews making inventive dishes from putty. Many years later, the boys dig their uncle up as a part of a sacrifice to create this goddess Sheeitah. That may all be well, but this film is an exercise in bad taste, seriously. Like Motel Hell, the ingredients the boys put into their food is not always genuine, where these boys make a rapid turn over. The much better looking guy falls in love with the girl of a cheer leading team who is later all shot to s..t before being cut up, one ingredient necessary at their Uncles request in Sheeitah's creation. Two detectives working this massacre come across similar crime scenes later, and they are pretty gruesome. The male detective is fun to watch, like when trying to come onto his partner with suggestive mouth gestures, like the waggle of his tongue, etc. The female, is a serious straight down the line cop. This horror film is gruesome and will feed horror lover's appetites, but really it just comes off as plain stupid bottom grade trash that is likable, but on a plain surface this is just bad. And what's with the repetition of the line, "Stop screwing around George". Ha ha, I'm really laughing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blood Diner is one of my all time favorites for sure . An unofficial sequel to Bloodfeast it borrows a lot from said gore classic and updates it for the 80's . This splatter comedy is a laugh riot and totally over the top and ridiculous . Expect cannibalism, vegetarians ,nude arobic cheerleaders ,hilarious comedy and gore . If you want to have a good time watching a campy horror film , Blood Diner is one of the best along with Frankenhooker and Street Trash.Very extreme and underrated. I give Blood Diner a 10 star rating because it is one of the funniest and most entertaining movies ever made.Many will disagree .However, this is a genre picture and for fans of gore and exploitation most will be satisfied with this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still trying to figure out what the f uck went on in this film.We've got a proto-Beavis and Butthead pair of brothers who, in tribute to their dead psychotic uncle, kill wanton women to serve up on their diner's menu; we've got necromancy to revive said uncle as a disembodied brain; we've also got said brain (complete with eyes) orchestrating and overseeing a plot to revive an ancient goddess with a name reminiscent of an Eighties cartoon villainess: all hail Sheetar! Did I forget to mention the rival diner owner and his sole talking puppet customer; or the vaguely grating pair of cop stereotypes? All of this got thrown into a gonzo gumbo with a varying aftertaste: sometimes, it hit the spot; other times, it left me wondering: "What the fu ck am I eating?" Perhaps I should check out Blood Feast, the slab of Sixties horror this hit 'n' miss homage pays tribute to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood Feast 2? No, Blood Diner 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically an 80's style comedy with European style gore. OTT gore too.Two young brothers get a visit from Uncle Anwar. (Really.) He gives them a present right before the cops kill him in a hail of bullets. Unc was a killer apparently. Years later same bros are running a greasy spoon when they manage to revive Unc's head with a voodoo spell. Now he needs a body. You see where this is going right?Like Frankenhooker, they get body parts for him from unsuspecting customers. And it being a diner, how do you THINK they get rid of the body parts they don't need???One poor lass gets deep fat fried, another fat dude gets creamed by a car, and another gets sawed in half.....lengthwise. The kills are creative beyond belief, and it's played as the blackest of black comedies. It almost seems like it could be a Police Academy knock-off at times.The humor is as gross as the kills too. Don't eat while watching this. And the two leads (Burks and Crews) do a good job with the material. Burks would die in a car crash not too long after the film's release.I used to own a cassette but got rid of it during on of my many international moves. I'm basing my review on a 20+ year old memory. I wonder if it's still watchable though?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right from the git-go with a hilarious scrolling warning of violence to come, the viewer becomes aware that nothing in "Blood Diner" is to be taken seriously. What you get is an over the top dark comedy, that races through 88 minutes at a frantic pace. It all begins with Uncle Anwar's talking resurrected brain that lives in a jar. He commands two doofus nephews in a hilarious scheme to resurrect a Lumerian Goddess. Nothing makes sense, a topless aerobic's class massacre, a female cop named Jackson who looks like a Michael Jackson clone, a competitor diner owner who communicates through his ventriloquist's dummy, a death by falling stalactite scene, and it goes on and on. The film must be seen, as describing it is futile. "Blood Diner" also has an outstanding doo-wop soundtrack. Highly recommended of it's type. - MERK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When someone asks you what the best horror remake is, what do you say? Usually it's going to be The Thing. Some might say Dawn of the Dead. The misguided might say Halloween. But there's one film that rarely, if ever, comes into the conversation, but most definitely should, and that's Blood Diner.Blood Diner is the 1987 redux of the classic HG Lewis flick Blood Feast. To be fair, if there ever was a film to warrant the term "re-imagining", this is it. If you've seen the Lewis film, you know it can be a little tedious and kind of drag on a little bit. I don't mean to take anything away from Mr. Lewis and his importance to the genre, it's just sometimes difficult to watch. Blood Diner on the other hand is a film meant for viewers with ADD. Or that are on copious amounts of drugs.The film is a pitch dark comedy featuring two brothers, Michael Tutman (Rick Burks) and George Tutman (Carl Crew) that take on the task of completing the resurrection the Lumerian goddess Sheetar, after their serial killer uncle Anwar Namtut (Drew Goddars) fails to do so (and is killed in the process).In order to resurrect Sheetar,the two brothers must piece together different body parts from nefarious women, and invoke the goddess at a "blood buffet" with a virgin on hand for Sheetar to eat when she awakens. The brothers, all the while, are running the very popular Tutman Cafe, which serves health food that's "too good to be true". Hmm. Two goofball detectives are hard at work trying to track down the brothers the whole time.I'll be honest with you, this is one of the most ludicrous films I've ever seen. Don't believe me? Watch this clip and find out for yourself. And that's only the half of it, other insane moments in the film include George's wresting match with "Jimmy Hitler" (pictured), a 400 pound health food critic that vomits on all of the patrons of the Tutman Cafe, an insane competitor to the café that talks to and through a life-sized dummy, and a topless cheerleader massacre. And if that's not enough reasons for you to watch this film, wait until you see the party scene in the final act. Pure gold.I really don't want to spoil the film. Let me take that back, I don't want to spoil the great gags in the film, because you need to see this one relatively fresh. As it was, the first time I watched it I was completely unsure of what to expect. The film starts off innocently enough, two kids at home in the 1950s are interrupted by a bloody, meat clever wielding killer as the play in their homes. Turns out the man holding the clever is none other than the kids Uncle Amwar! Amwar goes off on a small rant about how he had to cut off his own dick and then makes the two kids promise they will finish his work for him. They agree, the cops show up, he goes out to greet them and...well, just watch it.Finding this film on a home video format would be easier said than done, because the film has only officially been released on VHS. You can maybe find a bootleg DVD on Amazon or eBay every now and then, surely it's just a VHS transfer, but better than nothing. Of course, there's a link at the top of this post that will take you to the film in its entirety on Youtube, if you can stomach watching it in that format. Again, it's better than nothing. And this Blood Diner is a must watch.It's difficult to find the words to accurately describe Blood Diner. I don't want to give the impression that there is unintentional comedy here, they knew what they were doing when they made this flick. Most of the camp in this film is definitely by design, except for maybe some of the worst acting - namely Detective Shepard. A lot of movies that "know" they are bad, and play that aspect up, end up really sucking (a lot of Full Moon pictures come to mind), but Blood Diner really works. It ain't Re-Animator, but it's a great unheralded gem just waiting to be discovered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely hilarious, gory &amp; very fun horror comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1967, two young boys witnessed their crazed uncle's demise on their front lawn one evening after he went on a killing spree in attempt to raise an Egyptian goddess SHITAR. Twenty years later, the two boys are now grown up &amp; after resurrecting their uncle from beyond the grave (via placing his eyes &amp; brain in a jar following a ritual to bring him back) they attempt to pick up where he left off, capturing &amp; killing a series of male &amp; female victims, cutting them up &amp; serving them to their customers, while taking certain parts to set aside for Shitar, who's body the boys make out of a variety of different body parts. With three cops hot their trail &amp; a pretty young girl who is in love with one of the brothers in danger, the cops attempt to stop the boys &amp; their evil uncle from completing this grisly mission or face the evil Shitar &amp; die at her hands. BLOOD DINER is a film I heard a lot about &amp; was eager to see it. Originally supposed to be a sequel to BLOOD FEAST, the terrible &amp; serious minded 1963 horror item by H.G. LEWIS, BLOOD DINER is an absolutely hilarious &amp; gory horror/comedy that is far &amp; away better than H.G. Lewis film in a variety of ways, at least this film doesn't take itself to seriously &amp; as a result it provides for an absolutely hilarious &amp; gory good time. It even has a similar scene where a guy is telling the cops what happened to him &amp; his girlfriend on the beach, with the actor hilariously over playing it (unlike the other movie where the actor was attempting to be serious)! then again nothing tops the intended nude victim who beats up one of the killers using martial arts! The uncle's headstone reads: I'll Be Back! (heck he's even buried in the same bloody clothes he wore 20 years ago!) another tribute to BLOOD FEAST, is how the boys are able to hypnotize their victims into doing things for them. Add in a biker who can get run over countless times without a scratch, a nude aerobics class getting blown away by the dozens &amp; zombie feast at a rock concert at the end of the movie (with Shitar as it's leader) &amp; you have one of the best horror/comedies ever made! Highly recommended to horror &amp; gore fans! **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I wouldn't give an 'arm and a leg' (boo hiss) to see this movie it was actually a pleasant escape on an otherwise dull programming line-up the night I watched it for free on FearNet.It was bad, but in a good way. Some movies, like the more recent 'Doll Graveyard' or anything with Uwe Boll, try too hard to be something they're not, ie. good. Blood Diner is essentially an awful, trashy yet weird nugget of a film. The movie doesn't try to 'rise above the fray' to be anything more than that and to me, that's what makes it enjoyable.The characters themselves are odd and their performances for the most part were pathetic. The dialogue was abysmal, but the effects were pretty decent. There was also complete gratuitous nudity and gore throughout the production, which also made it even more campy (you need to watch the nude aerobics and 'karate' action to see what I mean).Honestly, it is ridiculously horrible and that is how it works. I can see how many viewers loathe this film and I certainly don't make any apologies for it. I gave it a higher than average rating because it was so unique and original. Even so, I don't know that I'd recommend it to everyone.On another note, if you like this film, you might even enjoy 'Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter'.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1963 Herschell Gordon Lewis gave us the video nasty, Blood Feast, about efforts to raise an Egyptian goddess. This is a funny homage to that film.Two brothers are following in their uncle's footsteps by slaughtering girls to prepare a Lumerian feast to raise the goddess Sheetar from the dead. As you might expect, there is lots of blood and knockers galore.What you will not expect is how funny this movie is. There are all sorts of crazy characters from a 400-pound redneck who is supposedly a health food nut, to the dumb detectives chasing the murders.The ending was just too much with carnage and a risen goddess that has a really strange way of satisfying her hunger.</fullReview>

The movie already starts off with an off screen voice telling you about the blood and ugliness that will follows. i was ready for it but after 5 minutes it was clear that this was becoming a cheesy movie. The eye plopping that was , well, be honest, laughable. It's clear that this is a rip off of Blood Feast. A brain telling to find virgins to awaken a Egyptian goddess. of course it couldn't be cheesy without the ridiculous script, over acting and a lot of nudity. The nude fitness for example. But after all it is bloody and a bit gory. Understandable that this one has his cult status. If you can find it, it's now out on DVD, be sure to watch it, you will have your laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorey, Absurdist Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This silly slasher flick cannot be judged by normal standards. Yes the plot is lame, the acting wooden, the writing amateurish, the gore fake as hell. In short, this is the quintessential B-movie.But what other movie, B or otherwise, has so blithely ignored convention and verisimilitude and plumbed the depths of absurdity to the extent that this one has? Hollywood wishes it could make something this farcical and ingratiatingly goofy. Tarantino and The Farrelly Bros. are the only mainstream directors who've come within shouting distance. John Woo, too, is right behind them with the wonderfully preposterous Face Off and MI:2. For instance, the scene where the rival restauranteur get his hands cut off by the brothers. This guy gets his hands chopped off, runs to his car, opens the door (not sure how), and starts it up. Quick cut to a shot of him driving away, stumps on the steering wheel and spurting blood onto the inside of the windshield. His vision obscured by the mini-geysers spurting from his arms, the driver attempts to clear the inside of windshield by...turning on the wipers!I still laugh so hard at that scene. That and the scene of Georgie joyously running over that biker with his van while listening to that Mambo song are among the funniest things I've ever seen on film.There are so many absurd little gems in this, like most of Uncle Anwar's brain's lines: "We need the blood of immoral girls!" "Put that slut on the shopping list!" "And keep your brother out of the gay bars." "Blood boofay." Honorable mention: the headcrushing scene outside the club. My favorite is the crowd reaction: they laugh! Also the radio announcer saying Anwar has a knife in one hand, his genitalia in the other.Anyway, this is definitely one for B-movie fans and people who enjoy their farce by the bloody shoveful.This movie reminds me of a quotation from the inestimable Brian Johnson of AC/DC regarding the sexual innuendo undergirding most that group's songs:"We are masters of the single entendre." </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious horror film (but it helps if you've seen BLOOD FEAST)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this movie is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It's almost a remake/sequel to the Herchell Gordon Lewis "classic" BLOOD FEAST, but unlike BLOOD FEAST, this movie is intentionally funny.It starts with an announcement on the radio of a homicidal maniac on the loose, just like BLOOD FEAST, but instead of a shapely blonde about to get killed, we're introduced to Little Georgie and Mikey Tutman who are left to their own devices while mom goes out to get cigarettes. They're playing Diner when the aforementioned maniac bursts through the door with a meat cleaver. They scream, "UNCLE ANWAR!" and run up and hug him. Before he goes outside and dies in a hail of police bullets, he entrusts the two boys with resurrecting "Shitar" (pronounced SHEE-tar), an Egyptian blood goddess or something (it's been a good number of years since I saw this, so you'll forgive any memory lapses).What I remember most about this movie is the outrageous violence, the hysterically over-the-top humor (for an excellent example of both, watch for the scene where the club doorman gets thrown into the street by Georgie), and the fact that it was directed by a woman, Jackie Kong. The reason that surprised me was because of the aforementioned amount of gore (the shot where the gravedigger's eyes pop out after being hit in the back of the head with a shovel is a portent of things to come - it's ridiculous, but also hilarious because of its outrageousness and perfectly sets you up for what's to come) and the incredibly gratuitous nudity.This movie is a parody of a gore film and should be viewed with that in mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's right "Blood Diner" was supposed to be a sort of sequel to the god awful H.G. Lewis gore flick "Blood Feast". Luckily this movie isn't as bad. It's actually pretty funny in some parts (i.e. the guy who gets his head crushed by the car on hydraulics or the fat man who throws up in the restaurant). With hilariously cheesy low-budget gore fx, one would wonder how a flick like this ever got banned in the first place (I think in Britain). The late 1980's sure was a time for those "bad" good movies. Anyone who thought "Toxic Avenger" or any other Troma produced film was good, they'll get a kick outta this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subversive Necrophile Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of director Jackie Kong's four films to date, this is by far the best. Intended as a tribute to the so-called father of gore, Hershell Gordon Lewis, and initially planned as a sequel to his classic splatter film "Blood Feast", Kong's effort emerges as a gruesome and rather nihilistic black comedy. What is most noteworthy about the film however is the degree to which Kong's style both stresses the infantilism of the genre's fascination with human viscera, and suggests the necrophilic lusts which are thus inherent in the depiction of the dismemberment of women. No-one could call this film politically correct, and Kong's approach often borders on the jokily inept, approaching a rather unfortunate level of camp. Nonetheless, few films embrace the theme as whole-heartedly as here, and Kong sustains the tone well enough to make her point. Whether that point is worth making, well... That the film is ostensibly a comedy makes those moments in it that work a disturbingly subversive near-celebration and eroticism of homicidal mania. Ultimately, Kong's direction is not up to the subtext, but the effort is commendable, and marks "Blood Diner" an unusually provocative look at the most disreputable of film genres, if not as self-reflexive as one would think. While in no way as extreme as the films of Jorg Buttgereit ("Nekromantik"), or as charmless as Joseph Zito's similarly necro-influenced "Friday the 13th Final Chapter", its low budget energy births a bleak comedy which holds human nature as vile, sadistic, petty and childish. There are no sympathetic characters, and ultimately no escape from the film's darker implications. To call the film ambitious is only partly accurate as there is very little in Kong's filmography to suggest such a coherent approach as here. The film is rather, a peculiarity, well worth a look, for those intrigued by how such aberrant practices can be eroticized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally intended as a sequel to the landmark Herschell Gordon Lewis splatter flick "Blood Feast", "Blood Diner" ends up as more of a loving homage to that film, with some key plot elements borrowed from it (with a little bit of "Pieces" thrown into the mix).Two demented brothers are fiercely devoted to their homicidal uncle Anwar, so much so that 20 years later, they resurrect Unc (his brain and eyes, anyway) and follow his instructions to create the ultimate Lemurian feast, and bring their god Sheetar to life.Working from a fun screenplay by Michael Sonye, cult director Jackie Kong ("The Being", "Night Patrol") makes this all very deliberate in terms of its cheesiness, trashiness, and camp factor. It's never at any time meant to be taken seriously, and in fact is quite an uproarious comedy at times. Granted, some viewers may find it merely stupid, instead of so stupid it's fun, but those who treasure utter schlock will find it a real hoot. Several actresses fulfil the nudity requirement, or at least bare their breasts, the gore is of the irresistibly tacky variety, and the special effects are always quite amusing. Sonyes' dialogue contains some real gems, such as "I lost my gentitals...and my life!" The acting is all of the obviously amateurish variety, with those who are required by the film to go truly over the top coming off the best, especially Drew Godderis as the maniacal Anwar. He's a riot as he harangues his dim bulb nephews as they, in turn, bungle their way through their depraved deeds. Rick Burks as Michael and Carl Crew as George are fun as the gleeful antagonists of the story. Max Morris likewise tickles the funny bone with his way OTT performance as the bizarrely accented police chief, while the very pretty LaNette La France gamely keeps a straight face as a detective on the case. Several Troma-esque highlights include the fate of a bouncer and the demolition of a victim set to a mambo number.The movie doesn't quite sustain itself for the entire time; even at 88 minutes it's a little over extended, but fortunately the momentum created early on is regained for a very bright and insane finale. (One's gotta dig those weird musical acts.)While not quite as much fun as this viewer would have liked, it's still endearing stuff that delivers a respectable amount of good laughs.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two odd brothers named Mike and George Tutman (Rick Burks and Carl Crewe) have dug up their uncle's grave and revive him with his eyeballs with talking brain that speaks in a jar. However the two brothers opens up a diner that serves quality meals but unknown to the city folk that the ingredients are made from human beings, of course the brothers go off at night killing innocent people and wants to stitch up parts to resurrect a cannibalistic goddess to life.Sick, gory and funny underrated B-movie horror comedy shocker from Jackie Kong is a Troma-esquire flick that is both repulsive and amusing at the same yet has gained a cult following over the years. The acting is pretty bad considering it's a b-movie but does have graphic scenes of gory violence including cannibalism, dismemberment, eyeball mutilation, exploding heads and more excess with nudity and a hot nude martial arts sequence that has to be seen to believed. There's hot girls like the main female officer with some humorous scenes like the rival vegetarian who is also a ventriloquist with a dummy of his own.It's a fun and not to be taken serious gore-feast that may upset some stomaches.Also recommended: "Cemetery Man", "Re-Animator", "The Toxic Avenger", "Blood Feast 1 &amp; 2", "Inside", "Martyrs", "The Untold Story", "Cannibal Ferox", "Pieces", "May", "Hostel 1 &amp; 2", "The Wizard of Gore (1970 and 2007)", "Demons", "Day of the Dead (1985)", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Series plus 2003 remake and The Beginning", "The Devil's Rejects", "House of 1000 Corpses", "Ichi The Killer", "Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky", "Saw Series", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Terror Firmer", "Poultreygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead", "Ebola Syndrome", "Cannibal Apocalypse", "From Dusk Till Dawn", "Grindhouse", "The Hills Have Eyes (1977 and 2006)", "My Bloody Valentine (1981 and 2009)", "Bride of Re-Animator", "Cat in The Brain", "High Tension", "The Last House on The Left (1972 and 2009)", "Feast", "Dead Alive (a.k.a.

This film finds two cannibalistic brothers who open up a health food diner in order to lure women in. They slice &amp; dice and cut the women into little pieces in order to bring back to life an evil goddess. The brain of their dead uncle serves as a guide to the two brothers. Lots of cheap laughs, awful effects, and laughable bad dialogue for fans of these type of movies. This is a horrible cannibalism movie for anyone who has the Heart to like "Blood Diner".Unrated for Graphic Sloppy Violence, Nudity, Sexual Situations and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What planet was this film made on?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw a screening of this film last night at a theatre (!) here in L.A. What a crazed nugget of insanity! A few of the folks involved with the film were on hand to expound at length on it (writer, a few of the actors) and tell a few stories out of school. A quick summary: 1) The film was originally going to be a proper sequel to the film Blood Feast by H.G. Lewis. Because Lewis was not involved, it wouldn't be right to make it an official sequel, they thought, so they changed the names of the characters. 2) Why did everyone in the movie have weird accents? Unclear. But "Chief Miller" has an East Indian accent, "Uncle Anwar" has a bad Egyptian accent, the male detective has a bad pseudo-New-Yawk accent though his character is supposed to be from California, and the black female detective goes back and forth from Ghetto accent to Queen of England throughout the movie, though the actress was allegedly from New Jersey! Yes, this is not supposed to be a serious horror film. Since it was not going to be a proper sequel to Blood Feast, it mutated into a "zany spoof." (And, it is not a "slasher" film as one other poster called it...nor is it a zombie film, really. It is a cannibal chef film. Yes there are others...Blood Feast, Motel Hell and The Undertaker and His Pals spring to mind.) It's always a bad/good sign for low-budget films when most of the actors have no other film credits on the IMDb. The fashions in this film are ridiculous! Look, I was there in 1987, and NOBODY really dressed that way, not even then. So funny. Even the decor in the diner is hilarious: pastel blue booths and geometric shapes stuck on the walls. If you'd like to eat there, it is now a pizza place on the corner of Hollywood Blvd. and Cahuenga Avenue in central Hollywood.Liked the choice of music: lots of old doo-wop and mambo songs which I guess they were able to license for cheap. Others referenced the scene where George runs over the biker (many times!) in his van while the mambo song clangs on the soundtrack. Hilarious! This film is chock full of howlingly bad lines and worse acting. The male detective dude is like the poor man's Adrian Zmed. And believe me, if you can't afford Adrian Zmed, you are VERY POOR. This whole thing is a certifiable HOOT. You need to see if you can dig up a VHS. Word is that it IS NOW AVAILABLE ON DVD, but only from a company in Germany. Several online retailers should be carrying it, but you may need one of those wacky special DVD players to watch it. Horror film nerds be advised. UPDATE 3/2012: No need to spend big bucks on that pricey import DVD anymore! Just picked up Blood Diner at Wal-Mart along with 5 other films (Fido, Parents, Earth Girls are Easy, Sundown and Boy Eats Girl) on the "Six Film Horror Collection" for the sum of FIVE BUCKS. That's slightly less than one dollar for Blood Diner. That's a little more like the proper price for it. You're welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I hate to deprecate any low-budget effort that actually gets made, BLOOD DINER, like the refrigerated body parts it delights in, stinks on ice.I delight in pop culture and can appreciate a good horror spoof more than most, but the whole idea of a satire is to be FUNNY, even if only in silly ways. I saw this film at a "Grindhouse"-series screening with the equally bloody but vastly superior LA HORRIPILANTE BESTIA HUMANA {NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES}(Mexico-1968), which had the audience in stitches. The writer of BLOOD DINER, who then introduced his film, said BLOODY APES would be "a tough act to follow". His fears proved all too well grounded, as the audience got a master-class on the difference between a hilariously inept film that actually WANTS to be scary and a disastrously inept one that tries for Troma-style archness through gross laughs and mega-splatter but fails to generate a single guffaw. When the writer, along with a producer and one of the stars, reminisced before BLOOD DINER, it was obvious that they had a wonderful time making the film, despite the difficulties they each had with the reportedly touchy and humorless director, Jackie Kong (who wasn't even TOLD of the screening...lucky lady). Their "we-survived-Jackie" repartee was far funnier than anything in the film itself, which overflows with amateur attempts at comic overacting and with gags, both verbal and visual, that consistently overestimate their ability to shock, amuse or even generate a blip on the audience's EEG. (If this EVER comes out on DVD and someone forces you to watch it, choose the commentary track -- if they're bright enough to record one; the film's actual sound is as poorly recorded as it was written.) The recently released THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVERA proves that a well-conceived horror satire can be a howl, just as the classic THE REANIMATOR shows that "the-bloodier-the-better" philosophy of film-making can have take an audience beyond fear into helpless laughter. Despite its smugness, BLOOD DINER merely feels desperate, like a 5-year-old trying to tell gross jokes to get attention and failing to make enough impression to even be sent to his room. (Though if he was in the back seat of the car, I probably WOULD say, "Don't make me turn around...!")On reflection, maybe the smell coming off this film had nothing to do with all the body parts. It was just the collective flop sweat of some seemingly nice guys who wasted their chance by aiming too low with too much contempt for both their subject and their audience. When will people learn that MST-3000 humor actually requires the filmmakers to have more than a collective IQ-80?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.... no matter how bad your film is, there is a chance someone will pick it up for distribution. Jackie Kong has really outdone himself with this one. Some of his other movies that utterly fail as horror flicks are at least good low-brow humour (e.g. The Being, with a good number of so-dumb-that-its-funny scenes). This one, Blood Diner, that supposedly has a comedic element, fails in this regard as well.Given an Ed Wood, John Waters, or Terry Gilliam kind of approach, this could have been a more deliberate kind of farce, and could possibly have actually turned into something that was at least mildly amusing to someone over the age of 12, which would be ahead of the game for Kong. I kept waiting for one redeeming scene or at least a good chuckle, but no luck. If this film was a little better it might be up to snuff for a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 kind of treatment.I understand that there are references to other films in the "classic gore" genre, and having spent too long in film school myself, there is always the temptation to wax analytical about possible deeper content of a story. However, once a film is sufficiently lacking in merit, going that direction is rather like treating a manure pile as if it were a diamond mine.</fullReview>

If you can't laugh at nazi-themed pro wrestlers, a vegetarian restaurant that serves vegetarians (literally), and slutty girls getting dunked head-first into a deep fryer, well, I don't want you in my house, much less breathing the same air, jerkhole.Some people would describe this movie, with its tasteless (and poorly done) gore, cheesy and sexist dialogue, and negligible acting as "so bad it's good", or a "guilty pleasure". Both assessments are dead wrong. A bad movie is 1 and 1/2 hours of your life that you will never get back, that offers nothing pleasing or memorable for the sensibilities. NOT 30 SECONDS goes by in this movie without some offensive one-liner or crude visual gag. It's pure, undiluted entertainment chock full of jiggling boobs, unsympathetic sleazeball characters and the violence that we all enjoy. And contrary to what the cult of Oprah will tell you, feel no guilt for wallowing in filth like this. They just don't make 'em like this anymore.Let me put it this way: if you enjoy early John Waters, mid-80's Troma films, and Peter Jackson's first three movies, you won't find a better grade B gross-out flick than this. Disregard the stuffy reviews from nerds who can't grasp that this isn't meant to be a "horror" movie in the vein of Halloween or whatever.</fullReview>

Blood Diner sat there in my VHS library for months before I ever watched it.While watching it I knew I had a treasure in my collection. The humor is completely absurd, the gore is silly, the horror level very low, while horror content was super high. It has a Troma-esque feel to it, so if you adore Troma films, then watch the hell out of this movie.It has the best use of sucker punching ever! Two cops stand in a room full of dismembered cheerleaders. The young "good looking" one makes an inappropriate remark so the older cop totally sucker punches him to teach him a lesson. Also, a beautiful scene in which one of the main characters beats the heck out of a customer until he vomits everywhere... Within a minute or so the same vomiting, beaten customer is given a free meal or something to compensate for what happened and he doesn't even seem phased!Great movie if you like absurd humor and blood rituals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of horror movies, then watch Blood Diner. It is NOT meant to be a classic or even a decent movie. It is meant to be bad and funny with lots of gore and t&amp;a. Don't watch this if you don't have a sense of humor. Go rent it today and watch it... Or else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of the people who take this movie seriously should really get a life. This is perhaps the best party movie ever made, simply because it is totally absurd. That is the point. This movie is not to be taken seriously. That should be very obvious by the talking brain and the girl with the hushpuppy head, but apparently people actually take this movie seriously. If you want a great laugh, then rent this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided seeing this movie for a long time, for director Kong doesn't exactly have a good track record. Then after hearing several positive opinions of it, I decided to take a chance.I loved it! Very sick and black, and very funny. Two hilarious performances by the actors playing the brothers, and right-on deadpan performances by others. The style of the movie and the kind of humor make me wonder if Peter Jackson saw this before making BRAINDEAD (a.k.a. DEAD ALIVE).One flaw in the movie is the obviously low budget. Though the movie gets by many times, there are a few scenes that look really cheap. Especially during the end, where the low budget really hurts what could have been an awesome climax (though it's still good.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well what would you expect of a movie that was originally planned as a sequel to Blood Feast? This film finds two cannibalistic brothers who open up a health food diner in order to lure women in. They slice &amp; dice and cut the women into little pieces in order to bring back to life an evil goddess. The brain of their dead uncle serves as a guide to the two brothers. Lots of cheap laughs, awful effects, and laughablely bad dialogue for fans of these type of movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two brothers resurrect their dead uncle to help them prepare for a sacrifice and to bring forth an ancient and evil goddess.The most inept horror film I have ever seen with some the worst make-up and effects I have seen in a long time. The effects are sooo bad they make JACK O's effects seem right up there with Terminator 2. If they doesn't turn you away, then the poor plotting and dumb characters will. My rating: 1 out of 10.Unrated contains Graphic, but sloppy Violence, Full Nudity, Sexual Content, and Language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you kidding me! WOW this is BAD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this is the 80's but really can this movie be any worse??? SO you have an evil Uncle who is into an ancient cult. He gets killed and his nephews dig him up and keep his brain in a jar. The jar then begins to talk and tell them how to revive the cult of Shitar. The nephews then have to kill repeatedly and keep the body parts as a stew. The acting is horrible..especially from the Police Captain and the male detective. The male detective is a horn ball and so OVER the top. The whole plot is so dumb that I can't believe I finished this movie. The final scene with the "blood feast" is so over the top and ridiculous. All I have to say is if you are sitting home and say.."I would love to see a stupid movie from the 80's with lots of gore" ..here is your movie. Just like my Summary title says WOW THIS IS BAD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gory and over the top tribute to Herschell Gordon Lewis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film begins with a warning about the 'unusual motion picture' that you are about to see, and that description really couldn't be much more apt, as Blood Diner is a relentless assault of absurdity and general weirdness. This film has been compared to Herschell Gordon Lewis' trash classic Video Nasty, Blood Feast, and that is a suitable comparison to make as both films are really very similar. However, while Lewis' film seemed odd because of his lack of budget and general ineptitude, Blood Diner is out and out over the top and ridiculous on purpose, and the two films have different slants. The plot focuses on two cannibalistic brothers, who have been recruited by their uncle to resurrect an ancient Egyptian goddess. And, if you think that's weird - wait until you find out that the uncle is actually a brain and a pair of eyes in a jar, and the only way to resurrect the goddess is through killing and butchering a bunch of slutty women, and then sticking the various body parts together, Frankenstein style! Jackie Kong's film is bloody and gory, but it's never shocking because everything in the film is rendered redundant due to the tacky way in which it's presented. For example, in one scene someone has their hands chopped off - and the resulting stumps are longer than his arm and hand were in the first place! Of course, the film is purely played out for laughs, and as a tribute to Herschell Gordon Lewis, Blood Diner works really well. The plot does get lost too often; however, as the focus is always on getting as much weirdness into the film as possible, and at times the film veers way off course. The central plot isn't too interesting, though, so half the time the fact that the it gets lost is actually a bonus. The film plays out with a big smile on its face until the end, when it explodes with a climax worthy of such a grossly absurd film. However, while all this weirdness is good; Blood Diner does feel rather empty overall. Of course, there's only so far you can go with a premise like this; but Jackie Kong has managed to go far as Lewis did back in the sixties, so I rate Blood Diner as a success...just.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible Garbage!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll get straight to the point. Do not rent this movie! Do not buy this movie! Do not watch this movie! I rented this thinking that it would be good, the beginning was promising giving us a warning about how bad and scary it is, that's just to draw you attention though! It's really not very good at all. The story is about 2 kids that study voodoo and black magic. They're russian uncle is a convict that carries a butcher and was shot down in their house at the beginning of the movie. They dig up his dead corpse and take his brain (which by the way is very fake looking) and the brain talks to them, out loud! It's horrible! They kids then open up a restaraunt and slaughter people and serve them. At one scene a stuffed dummy (much like the ones that people sit out for Halloween, but worse!) Starts talking to the people in the restaraunt. The voice sounds like Bob Sagget's voice did while immitating little kids in "America's Funniest Home Videos" not them I'm putting Bob Sagget down, this movie is supposed to be a HORROR film and it is anything but. Not scary at all! I give this movie a 1/2 out of 10 just because of the warning at the beginning of the video. HORRIBLE! Do not rent this if you know what's good for you! Two Thumbs Down!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy horror that's neither funny or horrific.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look what's on the menu at the Blood Diner: an all you can eat buffet of hokey joke-shop dismemberment and gore, followed by a main course of sick humour and a side order of gratuitous nudity, all topped with a generous serving of 80s cheese. Sounds tasty, huh?Well, director Jackie Kong's Blood Diner sure sounds like mouth-watering stuff for fans of silly low budget schlock-horror?but, unfortunately, despite having all the correct ingredients, what Kong serves up is an overcooked mess, and I found I lost my appetite pretty quickly.The story?a kind of unofficial sequel to H. G. Lewis's gore classic Blood Feast?follows two brothers as they set about preparing an all meat buffet (made from the body parts of immoral women) in preparation for the revival of an ancient Egyptian goddess. With the help of their Uncle Anwar (a talking disembodied brain in a jar), they gather the special ingredients needed for their ritual. Meanwhile, a couple of cops attempt to find out who is responsible for the spate of grisly murders that have been happening in the area.With shockingly awful acting from all involved, bags of unconvincing gore, and some of the most unbelievably insane and random 'comedy' imaginable (topless aerobics, a ventriloquist chef, a Hitler impersonating wrestler) Blood Diner is certainly a 'unique' viewing experience, but it isn't one that I found very enjoyable (and I'm usually rather partial to bad films).By the final scene?in which the audience at a bizarre rock concert (where an absurdly bequiffed singer is supported on stage by, amongst others, a pantomime horse and two trumpet-playing 'hitlers'!!) turn into zombies and feed upon the buffet of human flesh, thereby reviving the ancient goddess?I had had more than enough of this garbage! The dreadfully puerile humour, thoroughly annoying characters, and bargain basement effects made this crap-fest as hard to stomach as some of Troma's worst efforts. And that's saying something!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Today's menu: Gore &amp; blood-drenched virgin with extra cheese!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this sick and twisted horror satire right away; from the early moment when the following announcement can be heard over a police radio: "Escaped lunatic Anwar Tutman has been spotted with a meat cleaver in one hand and his own genitalia in the other!" How seriously messed up is that? Okay granted, "Blood Diner" is a pretty lousy and incompetent film, but at the same time it's GREAT to see that the spirit of Hershell Gordon Lewis was still very much alive during the late 80's. "Blood Diner" is kind of like a tribute/unofficial sequel to his "Blood Feast"; the very first gore-flick ever made and still one of the most legendary cult movies ever. This demented movie by Jackie Kong ("The Being") borrows the main storyline of Lewis' classic as well as multiple side elements like the talking brain in a jar, etc? By the command of their dead uncle, the vegetarian restaurant owning siblings Michael &amp; George attempt to resurrect the evil ancient Egyptian Goddess Sheetar. They require the body parts of slutty girls to put her together and a pure virgin for the essential blood sacrifice. "Blood Diner" is deliciously over-the-top in every department and therefore VERY entertaining to watch! The gore-effects are cheesy and tasteless (decapitations, severed limbs, crushed heads?) and the gags are extremely absurd (Nazi-wrestlers, ventriloquist cooks, disco-dancing zombies), and yet this movie is overall a lot more tolerable than, say, the oeuvre of Troma Productions. The acting performances are terrible; especially the duo of cops, and Jackie Kong seems to avoid logic and continuity on purpose! Judging by the overall very negative reactions of other reviewers around this site, I should probably consider it as one of my guilty pleasures. Well, so be it. "Blood Diner" is a whole lot of FUN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blood Diner" is without a doubt one of the worst horror movies ever made.I couldn't find any merit,any redeeming values in this trash.It's amazing that some people actually like this movie.The story is extremely stupid,the cast is horrid and the music is awful.It's obvious that this is a zero-budget movie,because the special effects are so laughably fake,so inept that I found myself laughing a lot during the film.OK,some people may say "Come down!This is a Troma picture!".Sure,but if they want to make a horror movie,they should make it scary or extremely bloody."Blood Diner" isn't scary,isn't even gory enough.It's simply a piece of garbage.If you have seen Troma's "Redneck Zombies" and you like that kind of stuff you might even like this trash,as for me,I give up.Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disgusting story about two brothers who serve up body parts (or something) for some evil god (or something). Actually the plot doesn't matter. This film only exists to shove every crude, disgusting, sexist joke ever made into your face. None of them are funny. I can take sick humor but these jokes are BEYOND sick! And there's TONS of female nudity shoved in your face. I can get that--most horror films from the 1980s had it...but this has an almost constant barrage of it. Never thought T&amp;A could be boring but it is here! And the gore--plenty of it. TONS of it actually. I suppose it doesn't matter that none of it looks even remotely real. It's funny at first but quickly gets tiresome. This is for guys who get off on seeing helpless nude women killed and dismembered and love non-stop sick humor. This is just a sick and disgusting piece of garbage that caters to the lowest common denominator. Utter filth. A 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blood Diner (1987) ** (out of 4) Campy homage to the cult classic Herschell Gordon Lewis film Blood Feast has two brothers running a store, which packs people in due to their secret meat. The meat of course is human flesh and to keep to store in stock they are constantly on a killing spree. This is certainly a film that tries to deliver on all levels of possible entertainment when it comes to a horror film. There's a lot of good stuff here but at the same time there's a lot of bad stuff. What doesn't work is all the humor that is scattered throughout the film and this includes everything with their dead uncle who the brothers dig up and keep his brain and eyes alive inside a jar. A lot of the other humor doesn't work either but the film tries to spoof a lot of things from heavy metal to slasher films and it even spoofs films that tries to say their fake stories are real. What does work is the homage to the Lewis film as the movie works as a pure gore feast as we get non-stop killings. The special effects are laughable but that's part of the charm I guess. There's also a large amount of nudity, which certainly helps the film. If you're a fan of the Lewis film then you might want to check this out but others would be best to stay away.</fullReview>
