		<shortDescription>One of the Most Entertaining Movies Of Its Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic version of "House on Haunted Hill" is one of the most entertaining examples of the low-budget, black-and-white horror films that used to be such a mainstay for movie fans. It has few frills, but it does have some thrills, and in particular it has a cleverly written story that is told at a brisk pace, with a good deal of interesting and pleasingly macabre detail.Horror legend Vincent Price is in his element as the mysterious millionaire who invites a houseful of guests to spend the night in a supposedly haunted mansion, and his performance will give his fans everything that they expect. The supporting cast is solid, led by Elisha Cook, who is very good as a nervous, tipsy character whose rambling proclamations of doom add the right touch of offbeat suspense. The settings are given plenty of detail that makes the characters' explorations of the house even more interesting.The story is nicely written for the genre, making very good use of the possibilities in the setup, throwing in some good turns, and resolving everything in a resourceful fashion. And it's not without some real suspense - even those who normally watch low-budget horror features solely for the camp factor might get an actual start once or twice as everything plays out. And even if you don't find anything scary, there is plenty here that makes it enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastically entertaining camp classic! A must see for all horror fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the awful, senseless remake, the original 'The House On Haunted Hill' is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable chillers of all time. William Castle's over the top camp style is an acquired taste for many, but once you enter into the spirit of things you're in for a wild, fun ride. The legendary Vincent Price is in his element here as the cynical millionaire trapped in a loveless sham of a marriage, and Carol Ohmart, who I have only ever seen in the cult classic 'Spiderbaby', is a knockout as his tough as nails "better half". Their haunted house party guests, led by the much loved character actor Elisha Cook, Jr ('The Maltese Falcon' ,The Killing',etc.etc.), are well cast and amusing, and the whole thing is a hoot! I recommend this movie to all horror fans. It is quite possibly the single most entertaining horror thriller of the 50s. Supremely silly but still scary at the same time. Great stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price is outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Price plays Frederick Loren, an eccentric millionaire that invites five very different people to a haunted house for a party, and offers them $10,000 if they can stay the night... This film benefits emphatically from the presence of the legendary Vincent Price. As usual, Price gives a commanding performance and completely steals every scene he's in. Price is undoubtedly the star of the show, but he's not the only star in the show; Elisha Cook in particular gives excellent support playing the wimpy owner of the house; much the same character that he played in the Kubrick masterpiece; 'The Killing'. The rest of the cast is largely made up of unknowns and b-grade actors, but they also all perform to relatively high standards in their respective roles.House on Haunted Hill's best feature other than the legendary Vincent Price, is undoubtedly the atmosphere of the house. Throughout the movie, there is an abundant sense of dread that is perpetually present and it serves the film well in that it brings the house to life; at every point in the movie, the audience is made to believe that there is something unseen in the house that will cause bad things to happen; and this is obviously exactly what a haunted house film needs. The film is very creepy in that way. That's not to say that this film is without its flaws; at times, the plot meanders and as the film only has a 75 minute running time, that's not good. It can also become a little dull at times as there isn't always a lot going on. This is, however, somewhat combated by the acting performances and defined characters as they usually manage to keep it at least interesting, if not enthralling throughout. House on Haunted Hill is topped off by a brilliant double twist, and it is also given certain originality by that also, although the twists do beg the question of whether or not the film has an appropriate title. The walking skeleton is hilarious, though and worth watching film for alone.Overall, House on Haunted Hill is a lovely little b movie; it's creative, it's atmospheric and it stars Vincent Price. Highly recommended viewing, especially for horror fans. Definitely not recommended for anyone though, is the dire 1999 remake of this film, and the equally appalling remake of William Castle's other ghost story; '13 Ghosts'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Price is right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched my share of horror movies, altho I am not an expert on the genre, and I have seen different settings. Of course, there can be mixed settings: a film about Dracula may take you to the Transylvanian outdoors, to streets or graveyards, as well as into the castle or mansion or whatever. But one way horror movies can be categorized is by whether most or all of the film is within a residence, or not. Bearing this in mind, I think something special about horror films is having the victim(s) enclosed inside a mansion or home, with escape difficult or impossible, and terrorized by anything one can imagine -- moving furniture, metamorphosing paintings, spooks in the attic, odd remnants, lights on and off -- as part of the buildup for a real or expected attack, by a person or whatever. The terror, suspense, is believing someone or something is or may be there, but where, and when, will it strike? "The Shining," "Die! Die! My Darling," "Beyond the Door," Behind Locked Doors," "The Haunting." Although claustrophobia might generally be a negative for me in a movie, such as "Rear Window" (unlike most people, I do not really like it), in horror movies it is great, it makes the day. If one looks at things this way, "House on Haunted Hill" can be seen as the quintessential horror film.Start with having Vincent Price in it, hopefully no arguments there. He plays Frederick Loren, the affluent host of a "party" in which he invites five people, not including himself and his wife, to a haunted mansion on a hill in a challenge for each person to win $10,000 (at today's value, about $100,000) if that person stays in the mansion all night. Among the five are Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook Jr.), an alcoholic, whose endemically spooked countenance sets the tone for what everyone is getting into. Frightface or not, he bears an (eerie?) resemblance to evangelist Pat Robertson, whether or not he is actually as scary. Altho Pritchard owns the house, he has spent little time in it, but he is nevertheless the expert on the circumstances surrounding seven deaths, including that of his brother, on the premises over many years. Quickly, the other four get the message: they may be facing trouble. And trouble begins quickly. Part of the idea is that there is no escape out of the mansion after midnight, when the caretakers leave, and barricades ensure this. Price's wife, Annabelle, is played by Carol Ohmart. She is striking blond, gorgeous, with very fair skin. In several scenes that I will not specify, her lightness is artfully contrasted against surrounding darkness by Director William Castle -- very beautiful, no special effects needed. Price has a jealous rage toward her and she in turn wants to get rid of him, as she has tried to do in the past. What will happen tonight? Of the other four characters, the two with the stronger presences in the first half are Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), a handsome pilot, and Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig), a pretty typist for one of Loren's companies and the early lead screamer. The other two are newspaper writer Ruth Bridgers (Julie Mitchum), who has a gambling problem, and Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal), a psychiatrist interested in the subject of scared people. A plot twist brings one of these latter two to greater prominence in the second half.The creaky doors, the body parts, the unexplained incidents all do their part in a movie in which black &amp; white is such an essential. The black &amp; white cements the atmosphere we need for the "house" (mansion): from a distance, from a close-up at the start of the movie, and then inside the mansion, everywhere. For those who profess love for "Casablanca" and cry "sacrilege" when they see the colored version, I say, OK, the true version to me is the original, but the colorized version is just the colorized version, what's wrong with watching it too? The movie still works in color, doesn't it, even if it is preferable in black &amp; white? To me, anyway. But as to "House on Haunted Hill" -- even if I similarly would not cry "sacrilege" to a colorized version, I ask, can you think of any other movie in which black &amp; while is so essential, in which a colorized version would lose so much? Maybe you can, but I can't.Loren, with his ulterior motives, has a smug, rather commanding aura, knowing that each of the five needs the $10,000. There can be skeletons in people's closets, yes. And as Loren's plans are threatened with derailment, keep this in mind. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Price asks five strangers to spend an evening in a haunted house for ten thousand dollars a piece. With his estranged wife in tow, the seven house guests begin a nocturnal odyssey of mayhem, murder, and the macabre. This film is a great vehicle for Price's unique talents as an actor, and is also a very atmospheric film due in large part to the direction of William Castle. Castle gives us all kinds of horror in the traditional vein...a severed head, a skeleton, the screaming-without-end hysterical young woman, the plot twists and turns, and the firmly planted tongue-in-cheek. The cast is very good, with Carol Omhart, as Price's elegant and gorgeous wife, and Elisha Cook, as a drunken sot who continually rants about all the evil that has happened in the house, as standouts. This is a great Halloween film, or one that you turn off the lights to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly Forgotten If Not Saved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle has made several wonderful horror films; some obviously better than others, but at the top of the list are "Thirteen Ghosts" and "House on Haunted Hill." This movie might though have been all but forgotten if not one plucky guy recently remade this movie in to a much more gory movie. That movie is a remake in name only, but this one is obviously more superior because it has the incredibly creepy presence of Vincent Price and the nervous tick of Elisha Cook. The ghosts aren't very scary, nor do we see anything really supernatural, but the atmosphere and uneasiness of this film makes for an incredible who done it story as you wonder who will get it. The set is intoxicating inasmuch as you never really see all of it, nor is it really explained what such a dangerous pit is doing in such a precarious spot in the basement. Such a matter isn't important. On the other side of the coin, the music and the special effects are rather hokey, but then when this was in the theaters, a lot of the teenagers would have been making out to have really bothered to pick this movie apart. It is only in recent years that movies have turned away from gore and back to movies with style and substance that we appreciate films like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really was his wife's party.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a very good tale of a house that may or may not be haunted. This version is better than the newer one, mainly because Vincent Price is so good here, much better than anyone in the new version made in 1999. It is also relatively short and goes by quickly. This movie has some of the same plot elements of the one from 1999, but thankfully the ending to this one is a lot better. I really enjoyed it, as I was hoping the one character would come out on top. This one is about a party being held in an old house that is supposed to be haunted. The people were invited by Price's character and offered $10,000 dollars if they were to stay the entire night. There is tension between Price's character and his wife, there is a girl who is very nervous and wants to leave immediately, and then there is the doctor who does not believe in ghosts. There are three others as well who are invited to stay the night. During the night strange things happen as one of the guests is murdered and there seems to be supernatural things happening. A very well done movie that for me ended perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darling, The Only Ghoul In The House Is You!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle liked to promote his films with gimmicks, and the gimmick for THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL was Emerg-O: at the peak of the action, a glowing skeleton "emerged from the screen" and flew out over the audience on a wire. By most accounts Emerg-O caused more laughter than chills, but fortunately Castle never relied on gimmicks alone: he also liked bona fide stars, and for HAUNTED HILL his star of choice was none other than the legendary horror star Vincent Price.Like most Castle films, HAUNTED HILL's plot reworks a well-worn theme. Millionaire Price and his wife Carol Ohmart give a "haunted house party" for five strangers chosen at random and promised ten thousand dollars if they last the night. The catch: the doors lock at midnight, after which there is no escape until the caretakers return in the morning. While the story itself doesn't hold many surprises, the script is unexpectedly witty, and Price plays it in a slightly prissy, very high-camp manner with a tremendous dose of the black humor for which he was so famous--and the little-known Carol Ohmart is every bit his match, snapping out memorable lines ("Darling, the only ghoul in the house is you!") in every scene. Together they elevate the film well above what you might otherwise expect, and when combined with the largely wooden supporting cast and some of the silliest this-is-supposed-to-scare-you effects imaginable the result is a cult classic with plenty of camp appeal.In addition to Price and Ohmart, the film is also surprisingly atmospheric. Shot in and around one of Frank Lloyd Wright's more famous structures, the grainy "late show" look of the film (due more to accident and age than deliberate intent) is very entertaining, the cinematic devices (everything from disembodied heads, irises, and jump-cuts) are very appealing, and the sound track (which sounds like a mix of piano bass keyes, synthesizer, and soprano vocals) is exactly what you'd want for this obvious but extremely entertaining flick. Of all the Castle films, THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is my personal favorite, and it should rate very high with fans of cult, camp, and Vincent Price. And I'll go further than that: of all his memorable appearances, I do believe this was among Price's best. A great choice for both family movie night or a sophisticated Halloween howl--very recommended! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable campy fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the many William Castle directed shockers of the '50's and '60's, this one is probably the most traditional in terms of being a "ghost story". The set up is irresistible (derivative of "Ten Little Indians" in a way.) Five unrelated people are chosen to spend the night in what is purported to be a haunted house. Several murders have taken place in the house in the past. If the participants stay the night, their host (Price) will give them each $10,000 (a nice chunk of change in 1958!) The house is surprisingly non-Gothic on the outside. It more closely resembles a piece of the 1937 "Lost Horizon" set. Inside, it has the more expected old woodwork, creaky doors, curtained alcoves, etc... Price is wonderful, as always, as the sardonic, mysterious host. His wife is played by a former beauty queen (Ohmart) who is attractive, if a bit frosty. They have some interesting repartee which reveals their mistrust and hatred for one another. The guests include leading man-type Long, ingenue Craig, nervous Cook, crusty Mitchum and debonair Marshal. Macabre Price gives the guests loaded guns as party favors! It doesn't take long for the unusual occurrences and minor creeps to begin. Soon, the inhabitants are locked in and couldn't leave even if they wanted to! Long and Craig play Fred and Daphne as they try to unravel the goings-on. Cook drinks and gets more paranoid. Marshal tends to the wounded, getting more involved as the story progresses. Mitchum (Robert's sister!) is given little to do and doesn't appear to be a very significant actress. The film is hokey, campy and illogical...full of contrivances and inanities. Yet, it is undeniably entertaining. All of the hallmarks of an old-fashioned scary movie are in place....the eerie music, the undependable lights, swinging doors, secret passages and without question the most hilarious, terrifyingly ugly housekeeper ever put on film!Price is right at home in these surroundings and does much to make the film palatable. There are a couple of fun plot twists to keep it from being too stale and the running time is a very comfortable hour and fifteen minutes. It's just a fun, entertaining way to waste an hour or so. Sadly, Craig (who had a real set of lungs on her...one of the greatest screamers ever!) was felled by a gunshot in real life about twelve years after this film was made at age 36. In fact, Marshal was dead within three years of heart ailments at 56 and Long died 16 years after from a heart attack at 47! And they say "Poltergeist" was cursed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky Hammy Movie From The Vault of William Castle !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle, the Master Promoter of Low Budget Horror films of the 50's and60's , takes a step closer to immortality with this tasty little thriller starring Vincent Price and Elijah Cook Jr. Not a great movie by any means, but the performances and screen presence of the top two are well worth your time. Price, a ritzy wealthy bon vivant , suspects his unfaithful wife ? might be attempting an early demise for him.He invites 5 people to spend the night at his house,to flesh out the possible killer. (The Historic Ennis Brown Mansion), now in disrepair, irony. The character Watson Pritchard(Elijah Cook Jr.)is the catalyst that helps promote the spookiness of the film. The subplots provided by Richard Long and Carolyn Craig , are just filler. As fate would have it, there are ironic twists , and lessons to be learned about having vats of acids in your cellar. Newer generations may be bored by lack of violence or gore, or the fact there isn't much action, but this is just an innocent date movies from the 50,s. Something to occupy a few hours on a Fri.nite in the dark. Most people in the audience provided their own entertainment. William Castle graduated to bigger and better films such as "Rosemary's Baby" later in the 60's.So, in the context of the film world, this will never make the top 1000, but if you need a film to watch in the dark with your significant other, then you might look at this one...Enjoy...Even the Skeleton gets Credit...Ha..Ha...Haaaaaa..........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and how scary it was to me, especially the scene where Nora sees the old lady ghost for the first time. I haven't seen this movie since I was 6 years old and I remember watching with my mom recently the "100 scariest movies" on BRAVO and this movie was mentioned, I figured since I had the opportunity to see it again, why not? Like I said, it's somewhat lost it's edge, but still 'till this day, House on Haunted Hill will always remain a great movie to watch any stormy night.Five strangers have been invited to a house on Haunted Hill, they are being offered by Vincent price $10,000 each, the catch? They have to spend the night at that house that has been cursed, thinking it's just a good old fashioned haunted party that Vincent's wife is throwing, they go along with it, especially since they could easily have $10,000. But things start to go a little crazy when horrible things happen to the guests, including the sights of ghosts. But questions are brought up when the wife seems pretty up on loosing her millionaire husband.The story was great and the ending was one of the first great twist endings of our time. Again, I could always easily laugh at some scenes now a days, but I think it is because of the fact that I've seen so many horror movies. Because I still remember those horrible nightmares this movie gave me as a kid and that's what makes this movie special to me, it will remain as the greatest sleepover flick! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad to the bones!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS ALL THE WAY!A splendidly entertaining exploitation chiller, constructed with cheerful contempt for the intelligence of its presumed teens-on-a-hot-date audience. I imagine it fulfilled more than adequately its generic purpose of making the girls scream and grab on to their boyfriends, but what distinguishes it from hundreds of scare shows of equally modest ambitions is its magnificent disdain - even by the standards of the genre - for plotting, structure, character, realism, consistency, and plausibility. Here are a few of its more noticeable liberties - and note that I don't call them "goofs". That would suggest that director William Castle and scriptwriter Robb White gave a tinker's cuss about whether it all made sense or not...1) The title - neither the house nor the hill is haunted. 2) Exterior and interior matching - the house is a boldly modernist design (by Frank Lloyd Wright, apparently), but all the fittings and furnishings are junkshop Victoriana. 3) How come a house built in the 1930s isn't wired for electricity? 4) And if it isn't, what magic power controls the time-locked outer doors and gates? 5) Why does the script stipulate the lack of electricity, anyway? It doesn't have any plot significance at all. 6) In a story with only seven characters, three of them have no function in the plot - and one of them hardly gets to say a word. 7) How come, years after someone was murdered in it, that hole in the cellar floor is still full of acid? Poor housekeeping? 8) Ever tried making a rope coil up by pushing it from one end? 9) If no-one could get out of the house, how did villainess Carol Ohmart manage to appear outside Carolyn Craig's bedroom window? 10) Floating at least one storey off the ground, at that? 11) How did Vincent Price's wife know he would invite her lover (whom he shows no sign of having met before) to the party? 12) And how did Price know about their fiendishly complicated plot to bump him off in time to construct a still more fiendishly complicated plot of his own? 13) Both of these plots - just to be picky - require the unwitting co-operation of another guest whom none of the three principals has ever met before the party ... 14) ... and one of them requires a hysterical girl, who's never handled a gun before, to shoot a man dead, quite spontaneously and purely out of fright. Is her real name Annie Oakley? 15) How does the scary old housekeeper pull that glide-across-the-floor stunt? Does that long black dress conceal a unicycle? 16) And if the butler wanted to encourage Carolyn Craig to get out of the house, was there no way less oblique then menacing her from around a door with a rubber werewolf mitt? 17) And then he locks her and everyone else inside the house anyway... 18) Another murder method I wouldn't care to rely on: scaring someone with a plastic skeleton and hoping she won't notice it's moving on ropes you could use to dock an aircraft carrier, but run away from it - backwards - into that convenient vat of acid. There should have been a preparatory line in the script about how she'd lost her glasses, like Velma in Scooby Doo. 19) And another one, laying the foundations for the same scene, making casual mention of Price's prowess as an amateur ventriloquist. 20) Why couldn't Price - a millionaire industrialist - just have shot the guilty couple out of hand and hired a good lawyer? Well, I'm glad he didn't, because that wouldn't have made half as delightful a film. House on Haunted Hill isn't the way it is through ineptitude, nor is it a spoof, nor is it a pioneering post-modernist essay in the so-bad-it's-good aesthetic. It's just a piece of strictly functional, disarmingly honest film-making that goes beyond mere unpretentiousness to deliberate disregard for craft, professionalism and sense - because it knows it doesn't need them. William Castle cuts to the chase and doesn't care how he gets there. His audience didn't care, either. Like me, though probably in a different way, they were too busy having fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie all the way through for the first time in years, and I loved it even more than when I was ten years old, and the climactic scene (which I will not give away here, not even under torture) scared the bejeezus out of me in the best possible way. As I remember it, I fidgeted in my chair, giggled uncontrollably, and never for a minute took my eyes off the TV.The plot for "House on Haunted Hill" is kind of ingenious, but it's also kind of absurd. There are a few holes in it, and by that I mean HOLES... but the atmospherics are great, and the witty, nuanced dialogue is head and shoulders above what horror fans are accustomed to.At the center, of course, is your host, Vincent Price, at his sly, elegant best. Price said of William Castle: "He wasn't a great filmmaker, but he knew how to make this kind of film." His respect for the material shows, and he nails the part of the mysterious, morally ambiguous Fredrick Loren with every word that comes out of his mouth. His final soliloquay at the denouement is delivered with all the care that actors usually reserve for Shakespeare. Obviously, he's having a great time.Of course, some gorehounds and younger viewers aren't going to "get" this. There are not many special effects, no monsters, and the severed heads look phoney. "The House on Haunted Hill" is tame by today's standards, but it holds up well for its atmosphere and wit. Sophisticated and silly at once.Other highlights include Carole Ohmart as Fredrick's wife Annibelle, Elisha Cook as Watson Pritchard, the half-mad, half-visionary owner of the house, and some terrific theme music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only the kiddies could possibly find anything really scary or original about this obvious and contrived fright film on a cheapie William Castle budget, THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL. Despite the fact that it features VINCENT PRICE as an eccentric millionaire who challenges a flock of guests to spend the night in his haunted mansion (and survive), it's got all the flavor of amateur night with performances ranging from bad to really bad.Of course, the title alone is enough to encourage some viewers to think they'll get some real scares--but it's a title that never lives up to the promise of something really haunting. Instead, we have chandeliers crashing, heads turning up in boxes, and some foaming vat of acid bubbling in the cellar while the guests lurk around in such stupid fashion that they seem to deserve their grisly fates.Unworthy of Vincent Price, an actor who did do a number of good horror films. This is not one of them. Strictly third-rate stuff, even for Halloween.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a very prolific career directing B-movies and serials of genres such as Western and Crime films, director William Castle entered the rejuvenated horror genre in 1958 with "Macabre", a murder mystery that maybe would not be as well remembered if it hadn't started what would become Castle's trademark for the following years, the "horror gimmick". Castle's horror movies would become well-known for the innovative tricks it used to scare the audiences, however, his next film "House on Haunted Hill", showed not only an improved gimmick, but also a huge improvement in terms of the overall quality of the film. William Castle had found his style, and "House on Haunted Hill" was only the beginning.The story of "House on Haunted Hill" is at its core, a new twist to the "old Dark House" kind of Gothic horror tales that had existed since the literary origins of the genre. Vincent Price is Frederick Loren, an eccentric multi-millionaire that decides to give a horror-themed party for his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart) in a very bizarre way. The strange party consist of inviting 5 strangers to an allegedly haunted house (where many murders have taken place), and to reward them with $10,000 if they manage to survive the night. As the challenge begins, strange events begin to happen and soon everyone wonders if there may be some true in the legend of the House on Haunted Hill.Written by Robb White, the story may be clichéd, but it's filled with excellent black comedy and has some very clever twists that give the film its very special charm. To expect a terrifying horror experience is to watch the film with the wrong attitude, as "House on Haunted Hill" moves more on the lines of subtle dark comedy with a dose of campy fun instead of graphic horror. Despite this tone, the film plays very good with the mystery that represents the House and the murders, and the ending still is one of the best surprises on film.William Castle directs this film following the conventions of the Gothic horror to the letter, but even when may had been a businessman first, he still was an artist, and shows off a very clever use of the camera to create mood an atmosphere. Castle was a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock, and it shows as Castle's visual style in "House on Haunted Hill" owes a lot to Hitchcock's inventive use of the camera to tell a story (The master of suspense would "return the favor" a year later with his very own b-movie, "Psycho"). Castle's elegant camera-work contrasts with the dark campy humor of the story giving the film its distinct tone, favored by the classic performances of Vincent Price and Elisha Cook.The legendary Vincent Price, who delivers an unforgettable performance with his enormous presence that makes his intentionally campy delivery even more enjoyable. Elisha Cook Jr. plays one of the guests at the party, Watson Pritchard, and his scene-stealing performance almost overshadows Price's (not an easy feat to accomplish). The surprise comes from Carol Ohmart, who plays Annabelle Loren, being a worthy counterpart to Price's character, as his character's gorgeous but treacherous wife. The rest of the cast is somewhat effective, with Carolyn Craig and Richard Long playing the "heroes" of the story with good results, although some other members of the cast are pretty average when compared to the previously mentioned actors.The biggest mistake one can make when watching "House on Haunted Hill" is to expect a fright-fest, as this is not a movie to watch for the scares (as they play along the camp humor the film has), but to enjoy with its witty written black comedy and the excellent deliver of the cast. While Castle's use of atmosphere and his camera-work do give the chills, it's never with the intention to actually scare, but simply to add to the tension and suspense the story has. I would recommend to watch the 1999 remake, as it follows the same basic plot but with no intentions to amuse, as it is a full-fledged horror film. Along with this movie it makes a nice contrast as it's always fun to check two VERY different ways to tell the same story."House on Haunted Hill" may look dated now, but it still packs the chills and the fun as if it had been released yesterday. One can only wonder about how it was to watch the film on the big screen and with Castle's gimmick at its peak, but still it is a nice experience for a dark rainy night. Vincent Price and Elisha Cook's performance worth the ticket. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, why did I see the remake first?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frederick Loren a millionaire (Vincent Price) throws a haunted house party in an old rented house, which has awful past of gruesome murders. He offers his guests (who he has never met) $10,000 if they can stay the night and survive the night's outcomes, if they don't see the next morning, then the money goes to their heirs.Seeing the remake first, kind of disappointed me because I knew what to expect when it came to watching this, but that didn't overly take away from my enjoyment of this charming, atmospheric and outrageous schlock. It's far better than the remake, though. What you get is a well-made shocker, which is still by the numbers, but what sets it out from the rest is energetic performances throughout the feature (which, it highly benefited from), the daunting exterior of the haunted house and the real hammy LOW budget effects that don't hamper, but add more to the charm and fun. But most of Castle's films are rather out there in context and more remembered for the gimmicks and tricks, and this one is no exception. This case a skeleton was used to move above the audience's heads while watching the film in the cinema. Some of its weakness is more in the screenplay, when there are many unexplained moments, sometimes-dodgy dialogue "one of us is guilty, and the rest of us is innocent" and the story's outcome felt rather sudden and lacklustre, leaving me rather unsatisfied. I was hoping for more ghoulish fun! Vincent Price turns in a superb and deviously suave performance. Most of his dialogue is priceless! The rest were top-notch, although female lead Nora became a real pain listening to her screams. The b/w cinematography fits exquisitely in capturing a rather eerie feel and the house's spooky features and bone rattling score also provide to the atmosphere. But don't be expecting anything particularly frightening as I found the suppose shocks 99% more hilarious than scary. Although I said the dialogue was sometimes dodgy, but it had its gripping moments that builds on the buzz of the plot. Anyhow, you can't go wrong when a thunderstorm pops up in the film, you just know things can't get any better! This is a film that doesn't rely on special effects like the *cough* remake (which was special effects overload), but actually on the performances and also throw in some nicely added black humour.Overall, a lot of good will equals good campy fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Haunted Hill...and a night of terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The House on Haunted Hill has to be one of Vincent Price's best movies and certainly one of his creepiest. I've seen this several times.Price plays a millionaire and, along with his wife, invite five people to stay overnight in a supposedly haunted house where several people have been murdered in the past and will give each person $10,000 if they see the night through. It isn't long before strange happenings start. We see "ghosts", a pit of acid and a skeleton. The millionaire's wife fakes her murder but is murdered at the end, along with her lover, who was one of the guests. It turns out this "party" was so she wanted her husband dead through her affair.House on Haunted Hill has a very eerie score and there is a thunderstorm to make it even more creepy.Joining Vincent Price in the cast are Carol Ohmart as his wife, Elisha Cook Jr and Juile Mitchum (Robert Mitchum's sister). Excellent parts from all.Watching House on Haunted Hill is a good to spend an hour and a quarter one evening. Very creepy.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't bother with the remake, this is the real deal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing how well HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL stands up after over 40 years. A popular staple on public domain video labels, HOUSE has just recently received popularity because of a slapshod Hollywood remake that killed all atmosphere and originality from the original. Steer clear of this one AT ALL COSTS! This is the real deal.Vincent Price is Frederick Loren, a reclusive millionaire who offers 5 people $10,000 each if they can survive one night in a creepy old house with a history of murders in many of the rooms. Blood drips from ceilings, a ghostly old woman glides through walls, decapitated heads appear in the oddest places, and a vat of acid in the cellar plays a role in a secret plot to eliminate one of the guests. Superb stuff, with so much atmosphere you couldn't cut it with one of those samurai knives and great performances by the whole cast. Notable turns include Carol Ohmart as Annabelle Loren, Frederick's sexy wife; Elisha Cook, Jr. as Lawrence Pritchard, the expert on the house's history; and Carolyn Craig, the token screamer.I have loved this movie for years and always will, especially the intricate plot, the house itself being a prominent character, and the cliches that seem oddly new when presented here. HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL can still shake up a scare among the blood-and-guts crowd, myself included, so give it a try and you will be surprised how effective a film from the 50s can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of old movie I grew up watching, and I just wanted to see if it held up at all. I thought it actually worked quite well, and at only a little more than an hour, it was a quick watch with little filler. The plot had interesting twists and was fairly tight. Black and white was also perfect for this "blast from the past". It's really more properly labeled as "Suspense" or "Thriller", rather than "Horror", so don't let the supposed genre turn you away. It's also quite tame by modern standards as far as any gruesome effects and such, but still manages to pack a greater emotional punch than a lot of modern movies with blood and guts flying everywhere. I'd say, slow down a bit every now and then, and try a true old classic like this one. They're fun and make a nice change of pace.</fullReview>

After watching this movie you might think twice before taking the bet.This movie has all your basic scares: cobwebs, creaking doors, skeletons, an eerie old mansion and a lot of mystery.A little fun: this movie came out in 1959 the prize is $10,000. At the time I am writing this review it is the end of 2014 and according to the inflation calculator the prize would equate to $81,592.10 in today's money.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid, watching this was a Halloween ritual. We made fun of the woman who kept asking for "Scotch and" (and...what?), and we pretended we weren't just a little creeped out. However, we grow up and even camp value only goes so far, and this thing can only survive on the very dregs of camp. Absolutely everything that occurs is laughably implausible and/or comically overdone, in particular Nora's sighting of the old lady ghost in the basement. This is a movie that sees no need to explain why, if this 'ghost' was really just the very unattractive caretaker's wife (as we see later on), she felt the need to hiss and hold out her hands in a ghostlike fashion while inexplicably in an empty cellar room. And, by the way, float and not walk. There's a lot more. Best moments: Richard Long plopping the severed head on a living room table, and Vincent Price reeling in the skeleton he used to scare his wife to death, a skeleton maneuvered by huge ropes somehow not visible earlier. Oh, whatever happened to Mystery Science Theater 3000??? This film was made for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill (1959) is a horror film directed by William Castle, written by Robb White, and starring Vincent Price as eccentric millionaire Fredrick Loren. He and his fourth wife, Annabelle, have invited five people to the house for a "Haunted House" party. Whoever stays in the house for one night will earn ten thousand dollars. As the night progresses, all the guests are trapped inside the house with ghosts, murderers, and other terrors. The film's style is similar in some retrospects to the E.C. comic books of the era, such as Tales from the Crypt, and features elements of campy humor. This film is a great film and will intrigue and entertainment true horror movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very creepy film that employs all of the Haunted House tricks seen in various other movies but there is a difference. As a kid I saw this film and was terrified by two scenes in particular, the old woman in the basement and the hanging woman outside the window with the snake like hanging rope. Both of these scenes terrified me for years later.It is probably a good thing I didn't see this movie with William Castle's special Emergo effect (a skeleton would descend into the theater during an appropriate black-out section in the movie) because I would have created a new exit at the movie house.The basic plot of the movie is about a very rich man inviting several strangers to his wife's birthday party at a haunted house. Soon people start to disappear and die. Vincent Price as the host is exquisitely sinister and Elisha Cook Jr. plays his part with the utmost feeling which helps the atmosphere along.Watch this one with the lights out and get goose-pimples and shudders from a well made spooky movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Remember the fun we had when you poisoned me?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though Vincent Price had a long and varied career, most horror film fans will know him by a trio of movies from the late 1950's - "The Bat" (1959), "The Fly" (1958), and this one - "House on Haunted Hill". When I first saw this film shortly after it's original release, it gave me the heebie jeebies for a week, especially having seen it alone in the dark. Today it doesn't affect the same response, but still, it's got a lot going for it and is a well written, creepy and atmospheric drama in which Price and a host of characters are given a chance to shine.The opening set up is quite classy - Elisha Cook's character Watson Pritchard is the owner of the house, and he snares the viewer with an immediate hook; seven violent murders have taken place in the house including his own brother. Price is Frederick Loren, the current resident, an eccentric millionaire who offers five people seemingly chosen at random, ten thousand dollars each if they can survive a night in the house. Pritchard, an alcoholic, doesn't let up throughout the film, he insists that dire consequences will occur - "Only the ghosts in this house are glad we're here." The film's first real fright catches you off guard, as Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig) examines an empty room, she suddenly turns into the haggardly face of the home's female caretaker, though we don't know that yet at this point. It's the kind of face you would make if you were trying to scare your little sister coming downstairs in the dark - funny but effective. There are other subtle events that keep you guessing, all done with an effective purpose and not just for shock value, a rarity in today's films. One of the better ones makes use of a thick rope that crawls it's way toward lead screamer Nora, but this time she's speechless, fixated on the ghostly image of Loren's wife Annabelle floating outside a window.The relationship between Loren and his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart) makes up a key plot element in the story. It's no secret that they share a tense relationship, Loren the jealous husband, and she the one willing to stick it out for a huge inheritance once he's met his demise. As the grim party of five come to believe that Loren is out to kill her or one of them, they all agree to remain in their rooms till morning to stay safe. Yeah, right! Now wouldn't it have made more sense for all of them just to stay in one room all together? But then, no murder, mystery or mayhem.The movie is peppered with some great lines, and Price's character gets his share. Commenting on his marriage, he offers - "What husband hasn't at one time wanted to kill his wife?" But my personal favorite, and you'll have to see the film for it's proper context, is "Do you really think there WAS a head in her suitcase?" Other clever elements are inserted as well, the coffin party favors with a handgun for each guest is a neat touch. Then there's the basement, a veritable fun house replete with a floor vat filled with poison acid. It's a real treat to see how Vincent Price literally "pulls the strings" of this murder mystery whodonit in the film's finale.Observation: freeze frame a close up of Carol Ohmart in her role as Mrs. Loren - doesn't she resemble what a mature Paris Hilton might look like? "House on Haunted Hill" remains on my yearly must see list, I'm sure you'll have fun with it too. Your thoughts will echo that of Elisha Cook's closing words - "They're coming for me now, and then they'll come for you."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird And Effective.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***No Spoilers Now, Read On.*** Six people have been invited to spend one night in a haunted house (don't worry it gets better). If they do, they will each receive ten-thousand US dollars. The house is rented, and the event orchestrated by, the eccentric kagillionare Frederick Loren (Vincent Price). Or is it, in fact, his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart)? The film keeps you guessing at the true purpose of the gathering and who is behind it. Those who accept Loren's invitation are: Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), a test-pilot, or racecar driver (I forget, something masculine and dangerous though); Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig), a "pretty" young thing who must provide for her family; Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook), a drunk, who has murky familial ties to the true owners of the house; Ruth Bridger (Julie Mitchum) is a society page columnist who is known to over imbibe on games of chance; Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal) has a particular interest in the psychology of hysteria (dark humors in the bile and what not) and views the event not just as a payday, but as an opportunity to gain insight into his area of study. They all need the money, for some reason or another, and willfully follow Loren into the imposingly Gothic house. He explains, over drinks, the rules of the night and that the doors will be locked at midnight.....from the outside! Nobody can get in or out, the windows being barred like a prison or.....a tomb! Anyway, they get a guided tour of the mansion from Pritchard who points out interesting features like the ceiling that drips blood, the pit filled with flesh dissolving acid in the wine cellar, and the spacious breakfast nook. Before everyone retires to their respective rooms, Loren presents them each with a "party favor": a small coffin containing a handgun. As the night proceeds, strange and unexplainable things occur, causing the guests to grow suspicious of one another and their hosts. The bumps in the night draw successively closer and then, out in the hallway, there is a scream........***Be Warned, (Mild) Spoilers Start Here.*** THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL starts out as a standard "haunted house" picture until we realize that the only "ghouls" in this creaky old mansion are the people themselves. Greed, lust and betrayal are no match for ephemeral specters. However, the film never addresses whether the house is really haunted or not. Strange things do happen which defy explanation. The apparition outside of the second floor window or the rope that moves of its own volition would seem laborious to fake even for seasoned snake-oil peddlers like the Lorens. Could it be that they don't know or that perhaps they don't care, preferring another layer of confusion to mask their intentions? I have a feeling that director William Castle put these scenes in to keep people guessing, or confused, or scared, but ultimately entertained. Castle is infamous as the guy who put buzzers in the seats at movie theaters to shock people during THE TINGLER (1959) and at the end of THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL he reportedly hung a plastic skeleton from wires, sending it dancing above the audience (it was a simpler time then, when mild electrical shocks did not result in angry lawsuits). Castle was renown for such gimmicks and would become the unofficial inspiration for 1993's Matinée (which features a great performance by John Goodman). In THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, the cast and crew never take the story too seriously and the film has a kind of tongue-in-cheek camp charm. Yeah, there's holes in the plot and stuff that doesn't make sense, but it's got Vincent Price and vats of acid. What more could you want? 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frederick Lauren has rented the house for a party for his wife. He is offering a staggering amount of money (for 1959) to anyone who could last the night. It was his wife's idea that the guests arrive in funeral cars.This was a low budget thriller produced and directed by William Castle back in the late 1950's. This shows not only what an inspired and talented team can do on a low budget, but it demonstrates some real talent as well. The house featured in this endeavor is the Ennis-Brown House in the prestigious Los Feliz area of Los Angeles. Other films featuring this house are "Black Rain, 1989; Blade Runner, 1982; Grand Canyon, 1991 and the Rocketeer, 1991.I will digress a moment or three to give a brief description of this house for you. Set up the atmosphere, as it will. If you know Me at all, you know that I appreciate a well-designed set. Not to mention a well designed house. This house has a history. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, this was a masterpiece of architectural genius. Visited by architects from around the world, this house is a National Landmark house which enjoys constant restoration efforts. Mr. Wright used 16" stone blocks to construct the home, Mayan designs throughout and fixed the window glasses, doors and framing work to be lighter at the bottom and darker at the top to invite a feeling of warmth and light to the occupants of every room. But now, back to the movie.This story was clever and full of intrigue. As a suspense, this is one of the greats. This is the movie which fathered the haunted house sub-genre, and boy, was it good. There are some scenes in this movie which still get my blood pumping. *LOL* The performances are never over the top, always professional, totally believable and extremely enjoyable and in my opinion, this is one of Price's best.When a scene hits a slow spot you can count on the character interaction between Price and Omhart to darkly lighten the mood. Their banter seems to be the comedic relief element, although the humor is dry, dark and deadly.As you watch this brilliant endeavor, you will recognize scenes, characters, even lines from the more recent renditions of this story, regardless of the title. Everything from Amityville to Stephen King's Rose Red seems to have taken a bit from this landmark horror, and it seems to have been beautifully parodied (along with about 10 other films) in Neil Simon's "Murder By Death" in the late 70's.As with all of Price's work, there are plot twists and elements which require thought. Those are what I love most about his movies. And as with all low budget endeavors, there are some plot holes, but rather than listing those here, I'll just let you enjoy the movie for yourself.It rates an easy 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

This isn't a social invitation: for various reasons, each invitee really needs the $10,000 that Loren, the host, offers them if they'll spend the night at the place.As the "party" starts, the host passes out loaded weapons, pistols, for each guest's protection. This is surely a first in party favors. Through the course of the film, strange, and in some cases, one could say deadly, occurrences take place. These all lead up to an interesting climax where a major player is shown to have been killed by being dissolved alive in a kind of acid bath. But then ....There are twists and turns in the film, but the presence of Vincent Price enlivens the whole film.It's lots of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally think that 1958's "House on Haunted Hill" is one of Vincent Price's best scary movies that he made over his long and storied career. Directed by the incomparable shock master, William Castle, it has all the elements for a good scary movie.Vincent Price portrays Frederick Loren, a wealthy businessman who has rented out a haunted house that has been the scene of several murders for an all night party for several people. He offers $10,000.00 to anyone who stays in the house overnight.Without giving too much away, there are several chilling moments in the film. Ghosts, an old woman who looks like a wicked witch, a walking skeleton, an acid pit in the dark and creepy basement and a suicide by Loren's beautiful wife Annabelle (played with frosty efficiency by Carol Ohmart) or is her death really a murder? There are several good supporting actors such as Richard Long and Carolyn Craig who help keep the movie entertaining.The 1999 remake of this classic film simply cannot hold a candle to the original. This is a great movie to watch while snuggled under the covers on a stormy night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't call this a bad movie, simply because unlike Ed Wood, William Castle knew what he was doing all the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the most fondly remembered film of William Castle. Its not his best work (I've always preferred either "The Tingler" or "13 Ghosts"), its the one thats attracted the biggest cult following. And while its not a perfect film by any stretch, its a very entertaining piece of high camp. Vincent Price's reputation stems from this film. He was capable of nuance and subtle performances (just check out "Witchfinder General" or "Laura"), but here he is in prime over-the-top bogeyman roles. One of the appealing aspects of Price is that he is one of the very few actors who is able to become so ludicrous and over-the-top yet still maintain dignity. He is possibly the greatest horror film star of all time.The film itself is slightly overrated, but still an enjoyable little cult item. Its never scary but is consistently entertaining and never dull. Sure, I could point out all the flaws and plot holes, but that would be taking the fun out of this. It wasn't meant to be "Citizen Kane", but a goofy little b-horror flick with some chills and the tongue planted firmly in cheek. You can't call this a bad movie, simply because unlike Ed Wood, William Castle knew what he was doing all the time. In addition to Price, both Elisha Cook Jr. and Carol Ohmart offer fine performances. I've only seen Cook do one kind of role, the neurotic nebbish, but he does the role very well and is always amusing to watch. This ranks with "The Killing" as his most memorable role. Carol Ohmart (who was also in the cult classic "Spider Baby") is sexy and icy cold as Price's wife. The rest of the cast is pretty lousy in the acting department (espescially Carolyn Craig who seems to be capable of doing nothing but screaming), but they add to the campy fun. And while the twist ending seems abrupt and implausible, its still a surprise when it comes. A nice little picture for a rainy day. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill was a surprisingly good movie. I wasn't expecting what I got out of the movie. It kicks off with the introduction to the characters. I don't remember their names. Right from the beginning the movie reeks of conspiracy and once you get inside the room with just Vince and his wife mystery only builds. Through a tour of the house the drunk shows where all the people had died and makes the comment that no one was just simply killed in the house, all of the murders were very brutal. As the movie progresses one of the girls continues to see things in the house and becomes hysterical according to the psychiatrist. The overall movie is a great watch for Halloween, or those who just love horror movies in general. It'll keep you guessing on weather or not the ghosts are real. The ending is really good, I really don't wanna spoil any of that for you. Just watch it, you'll wish you were invited too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can a bad movie be so good? That's the paradox we find on watching 'The House on Haunted Hill'- the first- the most frightening cheesecake ever put together. What's its secret? The screenplay itself doesn't hold too much water. For instance, how the hell Mr. Loren could foresee that that always-screaming pixie would go after him just when he's in the basement, so the murder would happen there, so he could scheme in advance all that skeleton stuff upon the sexy blonde, and the doors which close for itselves, and so, and so? He must have foreseen all the sequence of events, because the mechanics in the basement must have taken lots of time to be arranged. What kind of gadget, by the way, dims the lights in the basement and close its doors? An Acme-Do-It-Yourself ? And where the hell the blonde and busty Mrs. Loren has bought that Oscar-winning floating-with-rope-that-curls-for-itself special effect with which to scare the girl to death? " Good morning, Acme, here we are, the Lorens, what do you have for us today?" Including, of course, the thundering tempest itself, which blows just-just in time for the blonde-floating effect to start in the very moment the screaming girl would be looking outside? A hell of a weather forecast, for Ed Wood's sake!!Oh, wonderful entertaining cheap, spiced with thunders, and lightnings, and a perfect soundtrack, and plenty of mood, and a wonderful B&amp;W photography, and actors who chew the scenes one after another, and all - ALL! - those adorable clichés! How could William Castle make it so good? I just happen to love this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Want to go to an old house, spend the night, and be paid 10k for the effort? It's possible, but you must put up with organs playing by themselves, 2 screaming, hysterical females, ugly old ladies, hidden passages, a hanging corpse, decapitated heads, a walking skeleton, and, naturally, a thunder storm with lots of lightning. Of course, there is more to this 'party' than meets the eye. Lots of laughs and even a few frights in this Price classic. Go ahead and spend an hour and 15 minutes seeing it, but be very, very cautious that 'they' don't get you also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More funny than horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just recently downloaded a movie app and watched the original House on Haunted Hill, haven't seen that movie in 20, 25 years. Could not remember too much about the movie, except Vincent Price and his on stage wife, Carol Ohmart, could not remember her name at all, except she was hot. There was another actress, Carolyn Craig, who throughout the movie was a screamer, she had some lines but did more screaming than anything else. I started to laugh, she did it so much, her lungs and voice got a good workout on this movie. There were two kind of a funny scenes, the first wasn't meant to be funny but Carolyn Craig went running down the hall past Vincent Price's bedroom screaming her head off, two or three seconds latter, Alan Marshal, who played a psychiatrist walks to Vincent Price's door and knocks, Price opens the door and says, did you hear something? The second funny scene was a skeleton floats out of the acid vat and chases Vincent Price's wife around the basement until she falls in the acid, a false wall opens and Price walks out wearing a contraption with thick string controlling the skeleton, actually he looked like he was getting tangled up in the string. Maybe the acid works on skin but not on string. Elijah Cook Jr was also in the movie, his lines basically were, the ghosts are all around us, they are getting closer, you never really see any ghosts, except a crazy looking old lady. Carolyn goes running upstairs screaming into the living room, everybody says what happened, she told them she saw a ghost in the basement and describes it, Vincent Price says, that's not a ghost,that's the caretakers wife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Renting a supposed haunted house, an entrepreneur invites guests out for a party for his wife where they learn the house has is haunted by ghosts and forced to stay inside the house as they begin to suspect that the experience has nothing to do with ghosts.This is a little flawed, but there are some good points to it. The fact that the house looks pretty creepy works for it, for there's always a hallway looks creepy when blackened out or a piece of furniture that makes it gives off a feeling of dread. The big halls and huge spaces make it stand out in the creepiness factor. When it gets to working right, the film is really on. The biggest instance is the film's incredibly creepy finale, which is simply insane and one of the most creative ideas ever used to end a film. Another big moment is it's classic scene of the one character checking hollow walls, and a completely unknown character pops up unexpectedly, which is followed by the being floating down the hallway in an unearthly manner in front of the terrified witness which is a really excellent jump-scene and one of the greatest scenes in the film. There's a couple of other really great jump scenes in here where the ghosts pop out and terrorize the characters, including one really great one near the end where several individual jump scenes converge at once to throw in a really spectacular scene. This does have some great moments, but there are some problems with this one that really lowers this one. The biggest one is that film really makes no mention of the ghosts haunting the house for most of the movie. It's mentioned several times throughout that they're responsible for several past incidents in the house and it's built around them, yet they are hardly in the movie. There are only a few scenes with them involved in the film's play-out, and these don't really do much of anything to make non-believers actually believe that ghosts are behind it. Once the marital strife subplot is brought up, the ghost angle pretty much sinks into the background and is completely ignored for most of the film that winds up hurting the film's premise for the majority of the time. The other really big flaw is that there's a really drawn-out pace for this one. The constant dealings with the married couple, which take up the majority of the second half of the film, is completely dull and boring as nothing interesting happens during the entire part. Seeing them argue with each other is boring and slows down the film, offering nothing much interesting for the film as all the bickering and pretend- deaths get old fast, and even worse they take time away from the film's purpose. These are the film's biggest flaws.Today's Rating/PG: Mild Violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Millionaire Vincent Price throws a theme party for his wife at a notorious house with a bloody history. He invites five strangers to the party, offering each of them $10,000 if they can survive the night in the supposedly haunted house. Price is terrific as always. He's backed up by a solid cast that includes good turns from Carol Ohmart, Richard Long, Alan Marshal, and Elisha Cook, Jr. Carolyn Craig spends the whole movie scared out of her wits, screaming right and left. Leona Anderson is very creepy. Her early scenes are some of the movie's highlights. Ohmart and Price have a wonderfully wicked chemistry. This is probably producer/director William Castle's most famous movie. The patented Castle gimmick this time was "Emergo," which involved a plastic skeleton hovering around the movie theater on wires. As much fun as it is to watch on TV I can only imagine how much more fun the original theatrical experience was. Castle was a great showman. Also love the theremin music. This is a very entertaining movie with some good twists and wonderful camp value. It's just a lot of fun. Don't take it seriously and expect The Haunting or something and you should be pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Castle's Best Remembered Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Endellable Entry from the William Castle Filmography, Maybe His Most Remembered and Loved Movie. If You were 10 Years Old or Under and Saw this in the Theatre or on TV in the Sixties, it was Unforgettable and Very Scary. The Hideous Makeup on the Hag, the Bloody Severed Head, and the Overall Creepiness that Pervaded the Picture was Terrifying to Impressionable Young Minds. The Screams of the Horrified Female on Screen were Spine Tingling.There were Little Coffins with Guns and Elisha Cook Telling the Audience that "There's no use in saying good night.", and other Warnings Throughout. The Opening, Nothing but a Blank, Black, Screen with Chains Rattling and Sinister Sounds Set the Stage for what was to Come. When the Image did First Appear, Vincent Price and Cook's Disembodied Heads Superimposed Over a Very Cold Looking Architecture (Frank Lloyd Wright), Inviting the Guests to Spend a Night in the House on Haunted Hill, is as Eerie as it Gets in This Type of Thing. It May Not be Castle's Best Movie but it is Certainly the One that is Talked About the Most. A Genuine B-Movie Classic and Icon from the Last Days of 1950's Horror. What a Way to End the Decade. Alfred Hitchcock saw that it Made Tons of Money and Guess what He Made the Next Year? What a Way to Start the 1960's.William Castle has Often been Called the "Poor Man's Hitchcock", but this was One Time where the Master Huckster Inspired the Master Filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original House on Haunted Hill is a classic, but in a different form compared to something like Frankenstein or The Haunting. This movie is a very campy film that embodies fun horror and Halloween shenanigans perfectly despite it being not very scary at all. Despite its faults, it is a very entertaining film that is truly made better because of the man, the myth, and the legend Vincent Price.Good: Vincent Price really does make the movie. His presence is demanding your attention and his interactions with his wife are just tinged in dark humor and plenty of great comebacks. The movie has some great set design evoking classic haunted house imagery and it is a very campy tone that is a lot of fun.Bad: The supporting cast is rather dry and bland as they fill in just character types. Overall, it is a very campy and hokey horror movie, but it's so much fun and Vincent Price help makes this work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So. William Castle made a lot of movies, but none better than his magnum opus "House on Haunted Hill". Not even the visceral thrills handed out in "The Tingler" can best HOHH for sheer deliciousness.HOHH is really the ultimate Halloween epic, a tale of five greedy strangers invited to a "haunted house party" by an eccentric millionaire played by the iconic Vincent Price in one of his best performances. By turns arch, angry, and amused, Price steals every scene he's in. He's matched turn for turn by the blonde bombshell playing his philandering and murderous wife, the lovely Carol Ohmart. Each guest has been promised $10,000 to stay the night. A huge sum in 1959, the cash lures the invitees (all of whom need the money for various reasons) into being locked inside the house once midnight has passed. The house, which in a clever turn by Castle, is not the Gothic wreck we associate with hauntings, but a modern style of architecture which is no less forbidding once the party gets underway. Seven murders have occurred inside the fortress-like house, supposedly by ghosts who remain at large inside. Weasel supreme, Elisha Cook Jr. owns the house, but it's driven him crazy. His brother was among the murdered who now haunt the joint. Cook's shaky performance really drives the narrative, especially in the scene where he relates the story of the house. He's a freakshow himself, a regular Cassandra who flatly tells everyone they will be dead by dawn. Without relating the entirety of the plot, several classic scenes need to be mentioned: 1.The first appearance of the caretaker's wife, scaring the living daylights out of the secretary in the cellar's hidden room. It must be mentioned that the secretary, played by Carolyn Craig, is a world champion screamer. 2. The further unhinging of the secretary in the "hanging sequence". 3. Price's delivery of the party favors, which are revolvers housed in their own tiny coffins. 4. The appearing heads that "whisper to each other...and then cry". They do get around the house, even without legs. 5. The denouement of the wandering wife via an apparently living skeleton. And so on.Filmed in crisp black and white, with an often witty script by Robb White, this spookshow has never been topped. Even the multimillion dollar remake of HOHH in 1999 couldn't best it, despite the CG generated spooks on display. Once the mayhem is over, we get one of the most disturbing lines ever uttered as the movie comes to a close, Elisha Cook's drunken assurance that the ghosts are still around "restless...hungry. First they'll come for me - and then they'll come for you". We hear the ghosts moving in. Door closes on the survivors. Still chilling after fifty years. Oh, and that skeleton! Castle's standard ballyhoo for HOHH was the gimmick Emerg-O, in which a glow-in-the-dark skeleton was released on a wire to glide over the heads of the audience at the film's climax. According to Castle's autobiography "Step Right Up! I'm Gonna Scare the Pants Off America", that poor skeleton had to be retired since kids would stay through repeated showings of the movie, armed with things to throw at the bones, ultimately making the removal of the poor thing mandatory. I should know, I was one of those kids. Highly recommended for ghost lovers and other who enjoy their spooks with a side of Price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Multimillionaire Price offers a group of people a surprisingly light handful of cash to stay the night in his supposedly haunted house. And so begins the bat-on-a-string effects, as someone begins trying to scare them to death for their share of the money.This is one of Price's best roles, suave and silkily dangerous ("Do you remember the fun we had when you poisoned me?") The house itself, while it isn't exactly *haunted*, does have a wonderful film noir look about it, elegantly and stylishly dreadful looking, complete with candelabra chandelier, an acid bath in the basement, and an old bat being pulled around on a cart while making faces at the camera.Is it scary? Not in the least. It's about as scary as a sock puppet, but it's a lot of fun to watch, especially in a cinema, as I had the opportunity to do this past Halloween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd love to have seen 'House on Haunted Hill' upon its release. William Castle's movies might be a bit shonky, but the gimmicks he used to publicise them are legendary. The theatres in which this movie played were equipped with glow in the dark skeletons that would trundle over the heads of the audience at the appropriate moment. How much fun would that be? However, the movies themselves don't live up to their own gimmicks, and this one, while supplying a few chills and a typically enjoyable performance from Vincent Price, is no exception.Price plays Frederick Loren, a millionaire who invites a group of strangers to a supposedly haunted house and offers them a prize of $10,000 if they manage to stay there all night. The characters are a pretty boring bunch of stock types ? a sceptical psychiatrist, a screaming young woman, a heroic pilot, a spooked-out warning merchant and another woman who does virtually nothing. All of them need the money for one reason or another so they all want to see the night out ? but there is something sinister afoot, and the guests find themselves assaulted by what may be a bunch of spooks.Unlike that bludgeoning bore 'The Haunting', which is probably the most famous example of the old group-of-strangers-stuck-in-a-haunted-house movie, 'House on Haunted Hill' does actually have a few creepy bits. The moaning voices at the beginning sent a shiver down my spine, and the appearance of the old woman in the cellar is an eerie moment. Castle's genre movies are usually as corny as they come, and this one has a job lot of hokey horror staples - a big spooky house, severed heads, falling chandeliers, skeletons and all the rest ? so it should be good fun, but unfortunately once the set-up is out of the way the sludgy pacing and the one-note characters become boring very quickly. Rising above it all is Vincent Price, who is an invaluable presence in a movie like this. He's the perfect actor to lend credibility to less than credible movies because he can always give his characters authority: no matter how dumb the movie, he always seems to believe in everything that's happening, which is why he's so great. He made plenty of duff movies, but I can't say I've ever seen him give a duff performance. So it's really Price who makes this worth watching, especially in the morbid banter between him and his wife (Carol Ohmart). Watching a Vincent Price film is never a complete waste of time, but 'House on Haunted Hill' is never really spooky or fun enough to raise it above the level of patchy dullard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House On Haunted Hill is one of those endearing old horror movies where it's best not to dwell too much on the details of the plot. When one starts to analyse it the movie becomes absurd; but like a ghost train, it's an entertaining ride. Indeed it even opens with a cacophony of screams!Blessed with the presence of Vincent Price, the Merchant of Menace is in his element as the suave and waspish Frederick Loren, millionaire businessman who invites a small group of strangers to his wife's birthday party. Reputedly haunted according to the nervy owner Watson Pritchard (an equally nervy Elisha Cook in fine form), 7 people have met horrible deaths in the house, and, as Pritchard states "The ghosts are restless." There's lots of enjoyable bickering between Price and his wife (Carol Ohmart) - it's quickly clear that these two hate each other. Has Loren secretly killed his 3 previous wives? Has Annabelle already tried to poison him? Guessing who is planning to murder who is part of the fun.The film uses shots of a famous Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house for Haunted Hill's exteriors; inside is drably Gothic. And the movie has hardly started before the unexplained events begin.It would be spoiling it to say too much, but the expert staging of some of the supernatural phenomena would have fooled Houdini - there's no way this stuff could be faked, yet that is part of the film's charm.Engagingly creaky - and cheeky to boot - House On Haunted Hill does not outstay its welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill is directed by William Castle and written by Robb White. It stars Vincent Price, Carol Ohmart, Richard Long, Alan Marshal, Carolyn Craig, Elisha Cook Jr. and Julie Mitchum. Von Dexter scores the music and Carl E. Guthrie is the cinematographer.Eccentric millionaire Fredrick Loren (Price) and his latest wife, Annabelle (Ohmart), have invited 5 people to their house on Haunted Hill for a party. They have each been dangled a financial carrot, whoever will stay in the house for one night will earn ten thousand dollars. But doing so will not be easy, because once midnight arrives they are trapped in the house, alone with each other, the ghosts and other unknown terrors.As the 1950's headed into its final straight, William Castle seized upon the idea to reinvigorate the horror genre with creepy films and cheapo gimmicks. Not all of his horror output was worthy of praise, but in the main they have a nostalgic value that's hard to ignore. There's also a few of them that are genuinely good movies, films that whilst not capable of making you shriek in terror, have a gentle disquiet about them. One such film is House on Haunted Hill, camp and at times funny, it still makes for a creepy night in by the fire with all the lights turned off. Price is great, very regal like and imposing in presence. The rest of the cast may not come up to his standard, but he alone makes the trip to see the film worth it. Dexter's music is suitably "haunted house" like and Guthrie's photography thrives on shadowy atmospherics. There's also a couple of genuine "boo jump" moments, and at its core is solid "who is doing it" mystery. It didn't raise the bar for 50's horror, it did, however, keep the flame alight for it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) is a wealthy man with some strange ideas about throwing a party. He rents a supposed haunted house, invites five strangers, and offers them each $10,000 if they can make it through the night. But when Loren's wife ends up at the wrong end of a noose, the fun's over (or is really just beginning). Is a killer loose in the house or is the House on Haunted Hill really haunted? You know what I enjoy the most about older horror movies like House on Haunted Hill ? they were made at a time when horror movies could still be fun. Ridiculous looking heads could pop out of suitcases, unexplained hands could grope from behind walls, and skeletons ruled the cellar. Sure, it was all unrealistic, but was it ever a blast. And that's exactly what keeps me coming back to movies like House on Haunted Hill ? that sense of fun. Today's horror movies are too realistic, try too hard to be one big gross out, and have lost most of the enjoyable elements of old.One big plus for House on Haunted Hill is the cast. Well, not all the cast, but the movie does feature a couple of outstanding, memorable performances. Horror icon Vincent Price was just getting his feet wet in the genre in 1959. He may not have been the scene-chewing, over-the-top actor that most of us remember so fondly, but he was still rock solid in the role of the wealthy Frederick Loren. Almost as good is Carol Ohmart. Whether playing the victim or the victimizer, she's equally adept. As for the rest of the cast, the less said the better. I know we're supposed to identify with and root for the characters played by Carolyn Craig and Richard Long, but they're both so annoying that I always want to see both take a swim in the acid bath.Finally, what comment about House on Haunted Hill would be complete without a mention of the scene with the old lady in the basement. The horror in most of House on Haunted Hill may have been played for laughs, but when the hag in the cellar pops up, it's one of the best jump scares in the history of horror. I've seen the movie a dozen or more times and I know when the scene is coming up, but it still works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Castle's most mature effort remains gimmicky and silly in spots. Overall, though, it is a neatly accomplished effort to resurrect the 'old dark house' murder mystery of the 30s and 40s, a genre that pretty much came to an end after the Second World War. The house itself is something of a disappointment - the house in Castle's "13 Ghosts" seems more complicated and stranger than the art-deco job we've got here, and the interiors are pretty banal. But the characters are rather interesting, and for the most part believable given their biographies - and well acted throughout, especially by Cook Jr. and Vincent Price at his most sophisticated. Remembering that this is really a murder mystery, not a horror film, don't expect big shocks - pay attention to the puzzles. Admittedly a bit slow, but surprisingly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There will probably be several points at which you will simply want to turn off Castle's House on Haunted Hill. If you can, try to bear with it. The film pays off very nicely in its second half.Vincent Price gives one of his best performances as a seemingly deranged millionaire playboy who is giving his wife a gift she apparently does not want - a night with several strangers locked into an allegedly haunted house which has a tendency to murder its occupants. The strangers have been lured in by various promises - including $10k for anybody who survives the night. What follows is a series of highly improbable, sometimes laughable events which go on until about half way through the film - when Carolyn Craig's (somewhat over the top) female lead has been driven to the brink of insanity and is being held together only by an improbable hero - played by Richard Long. The film is well enough made, and the acting and directing are very good - especially Price and Ohmert (who I have often preferred to Marilyn Monroe)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love William Castle, and have for decades. What you never see written about him is that he obviously had an obsession with the work of Alfred Hitchock, from whom he steals liberally. This was the second in his long line of shock flicks. They just don't make them like this anymore. Incoherent, pointless, unintentionally hilarious and yet with some of the creepiest moments known to man. Castle was the master of the creep-out. Obviously the cast was aware how little sense any of this made at the time. Vincent Price, in particular, has amazing fun with his role as the rich, bored, effete host of an all night party in an honest-to-goodness haunted house (and a beaut it is, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright).What transpires next, is mayhem, and you can talk yourself into the fact that a black and white pot boiler from 1959 could not possibly get a rise out of you, but you'd be wrong, of course. Listen, nobody did it like Castle, before or since. For one thing the man understood the scare value of sound. He had to, he was very cheap. At any rate, this is a unique viewing experience, with brilliant timing, great performances and plot holes you could drive a semi through. It matters not. Suspend that rationality and enjoy. Incidentally, Castle's undervalued "Homicidal", is the greatest rip-off of "Psycho" ever, and a great film in it's own right, whereas his "The Tingler", may well be the greatest horror film ever made, and the most original of his schlock output. By the way, just in case you think Castle had no real talent, watch his brilliant production job on "Rosemary's Baby".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>--- SPOILER WARNING! ---In a decade that spawned, "The Creature from the Black Lagoon", "The Thing" and many other dirt-cheap horror flicks, it's nice to look back and see 1958's "House on Haunted Hill", a classic film about an eccentric millionaire who invites a group of strangers to spend the night in a haunted house. I won't call it a "horror" movie, simply because I don't find it very scary, nor will anyone over the age of three...But that doesn't matter. The point is, I liked this film, partly because it spawned a remake in 1999 that remains for me one of my favourite movies, but particularly because it has the mood, the plot and the intriguing characters that make it the ideal and --- yes, perfect --- black-and-white haunted house thriller.Vincent Price turns in a wicked performance as the millionaire, Frederick Loren, who is willing to pay total strangers ten thousand dollars each if they spend a night inside the gloomy, dusty old mansion...And, wouldn't you know it, pretty soon everyone is the target of a series of strange occurances? Blood stains on the cielings, vats filled with acid, floating heads, a creepy old lady who floats across the basement floor, and a falling chandalier make this one a keeper.If you're a veteran horror-movie buff who's seen everything there is to see out there today, you might want to retreat a few decades and take a look at "House on Haunted Hill". It's certainly not scary by today's standards, but it is an enjoyable haunted house flick that'll manage to entertain you, but won't keep you up at night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ham House on Haunted Hill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie worked great when it first came out. I was a kid and it scared the living hell out of me. When I see it on tv today, it does not scare me, but it is endlessly entertaining because it is so predictable and gives Price a chance to really ham it up --along the same lines as the Tingler, that is of the same vintage. What can you say about a group of people that are dumb enough to stay in a house whose caretaker is Elijah Cook of all people. (The same goes for Rosemary's Baby. Weren't John Cassavettes and Mia Farrow just a bit suspicious when the guy that showed them the apt. was the same Elijah Cook?) Both films were produced by Castle, who also has a cameo in the latter film. House on Haunted Hill, with very few special effects, except maybe emergo and the ridiculous hangman's rope trick, presents a preposterous melodrama-soap opera where everyone gets exactly what they deserve -- including the audience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think william castle is one underrated filmmaker. perhaps he's got a cult status that i am unaware of. whatever the case he had a brilliant touch, rather reminiscent of james whale's classic horror flicks of the 30's. this one is great fun, fully aware of its own budget drawbacks, therefore planting tongue firmly in cheek to be certain that each moment either gets a chill or a chuckle. "house on haunted hill" is one of those films that makes your realize why popcorn was ever brought into a movie theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably Castle's most consistent, enduring work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle's ?House on Haunted Hill' (1958) is quite appealing camp, endlessly more fun and enjoyable than the remake forty years later. Who needs CGFX when you've got Vincent Price leading an ensemble cast of eccentrics and misfits?Price is at his devilish best as a sickeningly wealthy industrialist who, rather curiously, offers $10,000 to each of five strangers if they dare spend the entire night in a supposedly haunted mansion. But Price, his ice cold trophy wife (beautiful Carol Ohmart), and a few of the guests have other goals in mind during this evening's mysterious event. Elisha Cook, Jr. (Kubrick's ?The Killing') plays, with perfection, the impotent owner of the mansion and one of the five guests. His catalogue-like knowledge of the mansion's many murders provides the background necessary to instill fear in the minds of the guests and the audience.If you know and like Castle's style, this comedy-drama is worth a look. Strange thing here is the title: There's no `haunted hill', and the `house' looks like a metropolitan library, not your classic haunted house. But this doesn't present a problem. -- david ross smith</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House On Haunted Hill...they don't make them like this anymore. Millionaire playboy, Frederick Loren (Vincent Price), throws a party for his wife, a haunted house party. He agrees to pay each guest 10,000 dollars if they stay the entire night...and survive. House On Haunted Hill is just a good campy classic that is well told. And as simple as it is, it hasn't been done right again. It's charming and likable in its simplicity. William Castle had a knack for pulling things off. He's one of the most inventive directors of early horror and a gimmick genius. Mix Castle's creativity with Robb White's storytelling ability and you get a great era for horror. Let's also not forget the presence of Vincent Price. Price was the king of cult horror, some say he still is. He's brings great credit to the horror genre. All these ingredients make for a good scare and fun film. Unlike most others, I highly recommend the remake as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wm. Castle's best.. perfect for Halloween!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1958 I was nine and many screamers, like "House on Haunted Hill" filled theatres for the teen crowd. I was too young to see this in the local movie house, but it made it to television a couple years later and was a regular staple, along with Castle's other pieces, on Saturday afternoon shows such as "Chiller". I probably watched HoHH dozens of times as a kid, and it gave me some very serious nightmares back then, but it seemed to vanish from the small screen for a very long time.. finally, I caught it last night, commercial-free on Turner Classic Movies, for the first time in at least 25 years.Viewed with an adult's skeptical viewpoint, this is really a pretty awful film. It tries so hard to be horrific, but it's hard to watch Vincent Price, a much missed, very cultured and smart guy (read his biography some time) and not think he had one really good time making this film.. it's absolutely one of his best performances in his long career.By now you probably know the plot, but briefly, a wacky millionaire rents a big old spooky house for a night and invites five people he doesn't know to spend the night there on a dare, telling them if they make it through alive to the next morning he'll give each of them $10,000.00. Hey, that was big money in 1958.The guests all arrive in hearses, and quickly get to know each other, but why were they invited? None of them know.The house itself, a strange architectural style, looking almost like a fortress from the outside, is quite Victorian on the inside, and reminds me a lot of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion.. velvet curtains and wallpaper, candle-filled chandeliers, big old wooden doors everywhere, lots of creepy dark corners, not the kind of place you'd want to spend the night alone, especially not after its owner tells you it's haunted, and that there are a couple of unaccounted for heads bouncing around the place..Okay so what makes a bad film so good?An awful lot of screen time is spent following the seven characters (the five guests, Price and his bitchy wife who wants his fortune) go in and out of bedrooms, up and down hallways, down to the basement, into closets, behind mysterious curtains.. it seems like none of them can stay put for more than a couple minutes at a time. You will get to know this house, or at least parts of it, quite well, as the camera tracks and pans around the same rooms and hallways an endless number of times. C'mon.. just lock yourself in your room, read a book, wait till morning and collect your money.. but NoooOoOooo..And then there's the basement, which, oddly enough, has a huge vat of acid under the floor.. closets with secret spaces between the walls, lights that go on and off by themselves, doors that open and close for no reason.. eeek!And oy the screaming. A sexy young female character named Nora, apparently one of Price's steno pool girls invited quite by random to the party, screams and screams until you'd think her tonsils are going to fly out of her mouth. She makes you wonder where the poor girl gets the strength. Nora is the epitome of every 1950s horror movie screaming girl you've ever seen, but again, wonderfully portrayed.And if you thought any one of these characters should lock herself in her bedroom until down, Nora would be the one you'd pick. Does she? Hah! Fat chance! Handsome leading man Richard Long obviously has eyes for Nora, and she for him, but just when you think there's a remote chance for an embrace and a kiss, something horrible happens again..Blood dripping from ceilings. An old woman who floats across the floor. A haunted rope that snakes in through the barred window and wraps itself around its victim's feet, a woman hanging from a noose in the hallway, seven people running around through this mayhem with guns, that vat of acid in the basement that you just KNOW is going to be put to good use before the titles roll.. All of this is both hilariously cliche' and yet somehow devilishly spooky at the same time. And these little set pieces just add to the images that HoHH will burn into your mind.HoHH would be up high on my list of Halloween movies, along with John Carpenter's film of that title, both versions of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, and both version of The Thing.Modern remakes of horror classics CAN be done well, as the remakes of IotBS and The Thing prove. Unfortunately, the remake of HoHH, except for a wonderfully shocking first 15 minutes, is pure dreck, and just besmirches the memory of Castle's wonderful masterpiece.Thanks again to cable channels like TCM and AMC who show these old films commercial-free, as they should be seen. It's almost like having the Saturday matinees back again..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Price, with the fabulous name of Frederick Loren, invites a disparate group of people to his spooky estate, offering each of them $10,000 if they can withstand one night of his (rather juvenile) demented tricks. Reconceived (poorly) in 1999 as a full-throttle horror show, this version was probably meant to be scary but today can be viewed as ghoulish camp, light on its feet and mindlessly enjoyable. William Castle production was originally released in "Emergo", a gimmick that set loose a skeleton above the theater audience. Fun for enthusiasts, and featuring a colorful supporting cast including cult-actress Carol Ohmart as Price's wife, Elisha Cook, Jr. and a very green Richard Long. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look no further than Vincent Price for an exciting classic horror movie about ghosts and murder. Writer/Producer/Director William Castle gives us a spine tingling tale of horror with plenty of screams. Vincent Price stars in this twisted tale. Hollywood's Lightest Heavy Elisha Cook Jr. (200 appearances as an actor) sets the mood. Sexy Carol Ohmart played Price's wife. The story is interesting and there are several twists and turns that keep your interest. Not bad at all for a 50's horror film. This film made $200,000 in 1959 and that spurred Alfred Hitchcock into creating Psycho. Hollywood has been discovering ever sense that horror movies make good money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When It Was Scary I Laughed (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSApart from the hilarious scenes that are not supposed to be hilarious and some of the most cheapest movie tricks you could ever see this is actually a pretty good movie. Trust me, though, there is no really scary scene. I laughed at almost every scene, especially when the fake skeleton limply pushes Annebelle into the acid thus killing her. That looked so cheesy. By the way, yeah, this is one of those hokey and cheesy movies made in the 50's and 60's, but this is a darn good one.Here is the plot of this movie. Five strangers are invited by a millionaire to go to a mansion and have a nice little party. The only problem is that this is not a party. The five people actually have to spend the night in the house if they want $10,000. Sounds easy, right? Wrong. The house is haunted. During the night spooky things happen around the house. The millionaire's wife Annebelle is supposedly murdered, another guest Patrich is just creepy, a guest named Nora is scared of everything, and another guest named Trent does nothing. It turns out that Annebelle was never killed, and she and Trent try to kill the millionaire. They fail, and they fall in acid. Everyone else escapes.Overall, this is a cheesy and corny movie but it is very entertaining and you will get a few good laughs here and there. Some scenes are frightening, like when Nora is tapping on walls with Lance and a elderly woman on what appears to be on a skateboard comes out of nowhere and obviously frightens Nora, but you will definitely laugh at most scenes. Some scenes are overacted, and some acting is just plain weird, but a lot of characters are fun and nice, except for Patrich. He is just weird. Anyway, this is a true classic that would be a perfect movie to watch on a rainy day.8/10 Recommended Films: Clue, a Haunting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House On Haunted Hill (1959): Starring Vincent Price, Carol Ohmart, Richard Long, Carol Craig, Elisha Cook Jr, Alan Marshal, Julie Mitchum, Leona Anderson, Howard Hoffman...Director William Castle, Screenplay Robb White.From 1959 comes this black-and-white horror film from director William Castle, who, by the way, enjoyed a celebrated career as a director of mostly horror films. Vincent Price was the box office draw for this film, as he was a big name in horror film in the 50's, making a career as an actor in horror films, usually in the role of the evil, intelligent villain. In "House on Haunted Hill", Frederic Loren and his wife Annabelle (Vincent Price and Carol Ohmart) live in a luxurious, vast but oddly-shaped home that has a history of violent murders, suicides and is reportedly haunted. The owners intend to sell the home but not before engaging in a little fun. They attract a group of "guest couples" to a party where they must spend the night in the supposedly haunted home and whoever lives through the night wins ten thousand dollars, even if all of them survive. Why not, say the guests- (played by Carole Craig, Richard Long, Elisha Cook Jr, Julie Mitchum and Leona Anderson), little do they know that the eccentric Frederic has a wicked trick up his sleeve. Initially, it appears the house is haunted. There's the usual frightening scream coming from God knows where, strange noises, voices, lights coming off and on, and even a ghost. One of the guest is murdered. The mystery of whether this is real or a scheme concocted by the wicked house owner is what keeps this movie interesting. Vincent Price is doing one hell of a job in a role he is clearly at home with and when he is not chewing the scenes, he is really a noteworthy actor. The film was, for its time, successful. The original music included a Haunted Hill theme by Richard Kayne and Richard Loring (cheesy by today's standards), and the home is actually one of the many post-modern homes of famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. While ultimately there is little real horror, the cynical aspects of this film take over. Vincent Price's character is disgusting, cold and clearly having fun at the expense of people's lives and fears. The film was re-made in 1999 but is nothing like this classic. Enjoy it for Halloween and have your own "haunted house" party!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard 50's Thriller Of No Great Note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Complete with Vincent Price as the star, this movie is the epitome of the 1950's style of thriller. A group of strangers are invited by a millionaire (Price) to spend a night in a supposedly haunted house with the promise of a $10000 reward to any who make it through.There's nothing particularly special about this. The usual fare (doors closing and locking for no reason, chandeliers shaking, strange apparitions) but nothing in it that seemed to me to be especially frightening. As the movie nears its end, we discover what's really going on here, and that creates more problems than anything.SPOILERPrice's wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart) is apparently having an affair with the psychiatrist Dr. Trent (Alan Marshal.) They use the "haunted house party" as an excuse to have Price bumped off without suspicion being cast on them. OK. Given that Frederick Loren (Price) apparently issued the invitations, how could they be sure that the psychiatrist would even be invited? Or, alternately, if Price knew about the affair, wouldn't the two have been suspicious at the "coincidence" invitation going mysteriously to Trent when everybody seems to be a stranger to each other?Anyway, nothing special here (although Carolyn Craig, who played Nora, has a great scream!)4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky fun presented by cinema's most sinister host</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent entertainment! There's no better way to describe William Castle's campiest achievement. With as good as no budget and no groundbreaking techniques at all, he delivered the ultimate in mindless fun. An utterly simple premise, decorated with a few tricks and of course the starring of the greatest horror actor of all time suffice to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film. Like no other actor could ever pull it off, the charismatic Vincent Price stars as an unscrupulous millionaire who, seemly random, invited five people to spend the night in his haunted mansion. Each of them is promised 10.000 dollars for it, but then they have to survive the night between ghosts and ghouls in the house that previously killed seven people already. Tiny details, like Price's snappy relationship with his fourth (!) wife or the presence of a paranoid guest who already lost some family members in the house only increase the intrigue and fun charm of this timeless genre classic. The visual effects are weak (I've seen films from the 30's that had better effects) but tension and atmosphere are nevertheless created by sudden spooky appearances, morbid set pieces and a decent implementation of sound effects. Biggest reason to see this "House on Haunted Hill", however, remains Vincent Price. It's nearly impossible to determine the best performance from his glorious oeuvre (The Witchfinder General, The Abominable Dr. Phibes, The Pit and the Pendulum, House of Wax?), but it's pretty clear that he had a great time playing this particular role. With a never before seen virtuosity, Price is showing the ickiest grimaces and firing off the most wicked one-liners ("Don't stay up all night thinking about ways to get rid of me?it makes wrinkles. The plot twist near the end is somewhat lame, though. And it's too bad that the film isn't a bit longer? (read: a higher body count). Still, "House?" is a must for horror fanatics. It's unbelievably cheap and eccentric, but also at least ten times scarier than the 1999 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Millionaire Fredrick Loren (Vincent Price)has assembled a group of people from all walks of life to a rented mansion in which each guest would receive $10,000 if they stay the entire night and of course stay alive to enjoy the earnings. You see this unique edifice (which resembled a prison,) nestled on the Hollywood Hills has a tragic history filled with unsolved murders,carnage galore and Ghosts? Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook) narrates his interest in this evil house of horrors as one of the returned guests. Previously Watson was found barely alive the next morning but his brother was murdered in such a grotesque way that he is coming back for a second attempt to survive the night. He also claims he needs the money. Cook's narration is what sold me and grabbed my curiosity in this movie. Our distinguished host Mr. Loren who coordinated this party without the help of his 4th Wife Annabel (Carol Ohmart), who stays in her room with no interest of parties or guests but throws plenty of condesending remarks at her husband and no shortage of friction and nasty quips between them, Mr. Loren aims a Champagne bottle at her head which sets up a caveat of things to come. There is questions as to what happened to the other three wives? All I know is Mr. Loren had fantastic alibi's and attorney's. Besides Watson Pritchard other guests include Actor Richard Long,Carolyn Craig (Nora Manning) hired for her fever pitched screaming which is heard throughout the movie. Julie Mitchum plays a gambler,columnist and has a problem erasing a marked hand. Rounding out our list is Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal). Marshal and Annabell have a secret romance brewing but our host Mr. Loren has other plans. Honorable mention to our scene stealer the elderly, craggy Leona Anderson who plays a floating ghoul and doubles as Mrs. Slydes. When you get right down to it this movie really doesn't show an slashing or bloodshed but it does terrify you. Will our guest make it through the night? Will Mr. Loren be a widower for the 4th time? Will Mrs. Loren be the merry widow with her new Doctor Boyfriend? Will Nora Stop screaming through the night? Will Miss Bridges stop rubbing her hands? Mr. Pitchard wondering will the ghosts come for you and you? As I watch this horror movie through the years I was first terrified but over time became a fan of horror/ comedy genre films. Vincent Price's lines are wry and comical in the scenes with his wife.To quote Lord Byron,"All comedies end with marriage!" Just one of those films that keeps you wondering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and deadly games for the guests</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill is directed by William Castle. The film stars Vincent Price, Elisha Cook Jr., Richard Long, Carol Ohmart, Alan Marshal, Carolyn Craig and Julie Mitchum.Millionaire Frederick Loren(Vincent Price)and his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart)invite five guests for Annabelle's birthday party. They are pilot Lance Schroeder(Richard Long),Mr. Pritchard (Elisha Cook Jr.)the current owner of the house, Nora Manning(Carolyn Craig), Dr. David Trent(Alan Marshal)and Ruth Bridgers(Julie Mitchum.This is a party with a difference, the group will have to spend the night in a famous haunted house. The guests will be paid ten thousand dollars each if they stay(and survive)the whole night. As the night goes on some very frightening and strange events occur and things take a deadly turn. Are there really violent spirits haunting this house? Can the group trust one another? This film is a perfect mix of horror and comedy, there are some very scary moments(the ghostly apparitions and the blood stain)and two terrific twists.Vincent Price is the highlight amongst the cast, his character is a very clever and observant man and Price gets the films best lines. Elisha Cook Jr. steals every scene he's in as the man who believes in the ghosts and is obsessed by the murders that occurred in the house.This is great fun and it's a film that I never get tired of watching, perfect viewing for Halloween or a dark and stormy day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They don't make 'em like this anymore. More's the pity, as William Castle's cheap and cheerful little spine-chiller is camp entertainment all the way. The budget is low, but Castle makes the best of his small location by filling it with macabre gags: a bloody severed head in a suitcase, a wraith of an old woman who slides around, a body hanging from a noose. These shocks are all served up in the best, nostalgia-ridden time-honoured tradition, with plenty of shrieks and screams as Castle derives maximum terror from each of the slight supernatural occurrences that he builds up.As an added bonus, horror star Vincent Price is cast in the lead role of Frederick Loren, a demented joker with plenty of tricks up his sleeves. Price is at his campest, jovial best here when talking sinisterly with his "amusing" wife, who has thrown the party. It turns out that his darling has tried to poison him on at least one occasion - but she makes out it's the other way round to a gullible guest (then again, what red-blooded male wouldn't fall for her charms?). The role seems to have been written for Price, either that or he just naturally fits it like a glove, and I really couldn't imagine any other actor in the role.Fleshing out the cast are Carol Ohmart as the lovely but devious wife, Alan Marshal as a stern doctor who hides some terrible secrets, and Richard Long as the young dashing hero. Only Long comes off badly - but his role is a poorly-written one, with much time taken up with indecision and a lack of action. Elisha Cook Jr. (who appeared again with Price in Corman's THE HAUNTED PALACE) enjoys himself as a spaced-out drunk who regales us with stories of murder and death, and it's a role he would essentially play in most of his latter-day films. The casting directors duly noted: if you needed an old-time and comical drunk, Elisha Cook was your man.Okay, so the direction is strictly by the book and the plot rather simplistic, but Castle concentrated here on the gimmicks of which he was so fond - this was the film where his infamous 'Emergo' came into play (a rubber glow-in-the-dark skeleton sailed past cinema-goers at a vital moment in the action). The opening of the film is a spooky masterpiece - disembodied heads introduce the cast and tell tall stories while screams and chains rattle in the darkness. And the best effect of all is saved until the end, where a woman is attacked by a ghostly skeleton which pushes her into an acid bath! It all turns out to be Price's work, as he's rigged up the skeleton as a puppet - although you're required to suspend disbelief in his fantastic mechanism. This skeleton moment is the highlight of a richly entertaining film, delightfully old-fashioned and catered for the kid in all of us. A remake followed in 1999 but obviously there's no substitute for Castle or Price. Just sit back, dim the lights and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap and Nasty Little Shocker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren and his glamorous young wife Annabelle invite five people to a house party. And not just any house party. This is a haunted house party. Loren has rented a mansion in which, over the years, seven people have been murdered and which is said to be haunted by their ghosts. The rules of the party are that whoever stays in the house for one night will earn $10,000. After midnight, however, the only door to the house will be locked until the morning, and there will be no escape. (All the windows are barred). The five, all of whom are in need of money, are a test pilot, a newspaper columnist, a psychiatrist, a secretary who works for one of Loren's companies and the brother of one of the murder victims. The plot is superficially similar to that of another horror film from a few years later, "The Haunting", which also concerned a disparate group of people invited to stay in a haunted house. There is, however, a major difference. Everything that happens in "House on Haunted Hill" can be explained in rational terms. Although Watson Pritchard (he whose brother was murdered in the house) wanders around warning his fellow guests that the ghosts are coming for them, they are threatened not by malevolent supernatural forces but by human evil. The supposed "party" is no more than an elaborate set-up for a complicated murder scheme- and there may be more than one person with murder in mind. When I say that everything in the film can be explained in rational terms, I was simply using the word "rational" to mean "non- supernatural". I was not implying that the plot makes a lot of sense, because it doesn't. The lack of logic starts with the house itself. It is supposed to be Victorian, and looks it from the inside, but the shots of the exterior show a building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1924 and which would still have looked strikingly modernistic in 1959. The film-makers couldn't even be bothered to look for a genuine Victorian property. It is the sort of less-than-desirable residence which still lacked electricity even in the late fifties- Loren and his guests have to make do with gas lighting- but which comes equipped with its own vat of acid in the basement for the unwary to stumble into. (As soon as this vat was mentioned I knew that at least one character would meet their death in it). And what self-respecting architect would design, and what self-respecting fire department allow, a house with only one door and bars on all the windows? The problems with the film do not end with the architecture. The plot seems full of holes. It is never, for example, explained why Pritchard has accepted Loren's invitation to spend a night in a building which obviously terrifies him and where he clearly expects to be killed. He can't have been that much in need of money. More importantly, the storyline, with its two interlinked murder plots, can be confusing and difficult to follow. Without wanting to give away too much of the ending, I can say that both schemes are so complicated, and so dependent on predicting exactly how a third person, who is not a party to the scheme, will behave, that I cannot imagine any would-be murderer ever coming up with them, especially as one of the killers does not seem to care very much about evading detection. The acting is undistinguished. Vincent Price, by far the best-known cast member, was a gifted actor, and could give good performances even in low-budget horror flicks, a genre in which he seemed to specialise. (I am thinking of films like Michael Reeves' "Witchfinder-General" and some of the Edgar Allen Poe series he made with Roger Corman). This, however, is one low-budget horror flick in which he failed to shine and it is not one of his better films. None of his co-stars, however, is any better, and some are considerably worse. Carol Ohmart is able to convey Annabelle's glamour, but never succeeds in conveying her essentially vicious nature. Elisha Cook's acting as Pritchard seems horribly mannered and exaggerated. Julie Mitchum (sister of the more famous Robert) as the columnist has so little to do that I wondered why the scriptwriter didn't simply write her character out and make do with four guests instead of five. Director William Castle does manage to pull a few surprises, resulting in a couple of genuinely scary moments, although these might have been more effective with a higher budget for special effects, but the film is little more than a cheap and nasty shocker which looks very dated today. There were some excellent horror films from the late fifties and early sixties- "The Haunting", "The Masque of the Red Death" and, above all, Hitchcock's "Psycho", but "House on Haunted Hill" is not one of them. I find myself quite unable to comprehend the relatively high score it enjoys on this board. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6.9 is underrating this movie. It is a very scary movie. A rich couple find a gorp of people who need money. And offer then a lot of money if the send the night in a haunted house. The remake from 1999 it a scarier. The follow up to the 1999 version The Return to the house on haunted hill is also scarier. But still this is one of the scariest movies to come before 1999. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. Vincent Price was a great actor. Carol Olmart was a great actress. Richard Long was a great actor. Alan Marshal was a great actor. Carolyn Craig was great actress. All The House on Haunted hill movies are must sees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price elevates a bloodless suspense movie low in any real scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) concocts a complicated and fiendish plan to catch out scheming would-be murderers, his wife blonde femme fatale Annabelle Loren (Carol Ohmart) and concerned psychiatrist Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal). Frederick invites a motley crew of guests as party attendees for his wife's party, offering each of them $10k to stay all night locked in the haunted house, scene of multiple murders in the past. One of the guests, the house owner Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook Jr.), is a survivor of a previous incident during which his brother was murdered. And seemingly two steps away from being committed himself, Pritchard has returned to warn the others of the terrors of this house and possibly meet his fate. The action revolves around the murder plot and forces test pilot Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), into an investigation of the house's secrets in order to find a way out of the house, so he can contact the authorities. Scream queen secretary/typist Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig) forces the pace along screaming the place down and jumping at shadows at every opportunity.Although this film was made in 1959, it follows the normal path of this type of haunted house movie, where a clueless group of people are frightened into taking precipitous actions while armed with guns - due to sheer terror. False walls,traps, red herrings and suspicious motives of all the guests locked together in the house until morning.Talking Pictures TV - Freeview 81.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's scary! The movie cost producer/director William Castle $150,000 to make. In its initial USA engagements, it grossed no less than $3,000,000. Admittedly, Castle spent more on advertising (over $350,000 to be exact) than he did on the movie, but it must be admitted that by his usual rather basic, humble standards, this movie is extremely well directed. Well acted too, particularly by the lovely Carolyn Craig as Nora Manning (Carolyn was very much similar to this character in real life. In fact, I liked the name, Manning, so much that I gave it to my detective character, Merryll Manning). All the players, indeed, are well cast ? even Elisha Cook doesn't out-stay his welcome ? and Vincent Price, of course, is absolutely priceless as both narrator and main character. Available on a superb Legend Films DVD in both its original black-and-white and a most effective colorized version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very dated, low budget, simple and crude special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie felt very dated. I think what disturbs me most, is that this haunted house-story is obviously aimed at an adult audience, and the characters/actors are also adult - a few of them even mature and elderly. Of course a haunted house-story can have adult characters as well, but the "normal" thing, is that the characters the audience is supposed to identify with are teenagers or young adults, and that the audience is supposed to be the same age or younger. The plot of "House on Haunted Hill", in my opinion, is too immature and silly for an adult audience, especially as the movie is taking itself so seriously. There is no element of irony, parody or comedy in it.Another reason that the movie seems so dated, is the very crude and simple special effects and masking. A low budget movie does not necessarily mean a bad movie, but this depends on what type of movie it is. A horror movie that relies a lot on special effects and masking, simply has to have an adequate budget for those things. In this movie they were so bad that I expected it to turn out to be a horror comedy after all - a parody on bad haunted house movies. But that was not the case...Al in all, I think this movie can be worth seeing once, just because it has become a "cult" horror movie. And Vincent Price is always Vincent Price!</fullReview>

Still, it's thoroughly watchable and loads of silly fun. Expect something more in line with a TV movie than a theatrical release.

Here he's a millionaire throwing a party for his wife, at a haunted house, with a bunch of strangers for company.Vincent and his wife steal the show as a couple that truly hate each other, to the point were they want to kill each other, and have seemingly dragged all these Innocent people into a strange game with each other in a house notorious for the deaths of seven people. The house itself is full of hidden passages, creepy staff, and a reluctant doom-spouting owner who quickly gets full of whiskey and creeps out the other party guest, but as you might have guessed all is not as it seems. I loved the ambiguity regarding whether the house was actually haunted or not, and I'd leave it up to you what you think (although several 'clues' helped me make my mind up). There's plenty of creepy atmosphere here, from organs that play themselves, rocking chandeliers and ceilings dripping blood, and at the centre of it all you've got Price, who can convey menace with a single raised eyebrow. This is a good film from a bygone age, and although a little cheesy is definitely worth a look for those who tend to avoid black and white horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"House on Haunted Hill" is about a millionaire whose wife decides to have a little night party at a so-called Haunted House. He invites 5 strangers to the party, and if they can survive until morning, then they'll all receive 10,000$. Hence the spooks begin.This is a great little horror movie that everybody should know about. It's got everything going for it, from the chills to the actors. My only complaint is that the story doesn't evolve that much, but there are some surprises in the end that I loved.First off, the acting. Let's start with the guests. Julie Mitchum is great as Ruth Bridgers, the columnist with a betting habit. Alan Grant is wonderful as the psychiatrist Dr. David Trent, who is a part of the surprise towards the end. Then, we have Elisha Cook, who does a fantastic job playing the fearful and paranoid Watson Pritchard. Richard Long plays the part of pilot Lance Schroeder, who seems to be in love with the main female character, Nora Manning, excellently portrayed by Carolyn Craig. Carol Ohmart is great as Annabelle Loren, the wife of Vincent Price in this film. She does a great job matching wits with Price's character, as the two basically hate each other in the film.But, let's not forget the main star himself, Vincent Price. When it comes to horror movies these days, you want to be compared to this guy, because he was the man of horror back in his day. With hits like this and "House of Wax" (both of which have had the adverse treatment known as the remake), he was a star, and this film clearly shows why. Even when he is voicing the rap on Michael Jackson's "Thriller" (Yes, that's him), you can tell that he was made for these types of movies.This movie does not just succeed on actors, though. It also succeeds in the atmosphere and the "jump-moments" department. The house itself is quite spooky; every time one of the characters went off on their own, I was like "No! Don't do it!" Maybe I've seen too many horror movies to know that something bad is going to happen when they do that. And the moments that were supposed to be scary actually were scary. The part where one of the caretakers appear to scare crap out of Nora and then float on out of the room was actually pretty scary when I first saw it. This movie has it all.Overall, if you're a horror movie collector, then you should see this movie. Yes, it may have been made in the late 1950's, but it is a wonderfully done film. If I were you, I'd see this over the 1999 remake; I haven't seen that one, but if I know remakes, they are never as good as the original (Don't get me wrong, Geoffrey Rush is an amazing actor, but he's probably the only reason why I'd see the remake). A 9/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic haunted house scenario -- bring together a group of strangers and promise them a wad of cash if they can last the night. Tons of fun with chills and thrills... vats of acid, floating ghosts, skeletons, severed heads ("Would you like to see one of those heads? Then come with me!"), falling chandeliers. It's a grand old time. Between this and WHEN STRANGERS MARRY, Castle is growing on me quickly. The movie has the expected camp appeal, with over-the-top characters (the great Elisha Cook takes the cake in that department) and silly situations. It's also a pretty damn good thriller, one that doesn't feel too predictable. The script is compact, getting us straight into the action with minimal fuss, and contains some delightful dialogue. Good performances too, and not just from Price and Cook. It's hard not to get swept up in it, it's just a wickedly fun movie with some Gothic stylings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 50's fright-flick is by no means that serious or scary...but it is fun and entertaining on a stormy night. The cheesiness and "camp" is definitely abundant, but there a few good spooky moments. The supposed "old lady" ghost was actually pretty freaky. Love the house they used as well! The plot too is interesting with a group of people being offered a large amount of money ($10,000 in the 50's would probably be like $100,000 today) to try and stick it out in a supposed "haunted" house. To me that would be fun if offered that deal...knowing that it was a set-up and that all the "scares" and ghouls would be awaiting.But, then part way into the movie real murders start happening and waiting to see who is behind them is almost like a ghostly film noir. The skeleton at the end was a little over the top...but hey, it was the 50's and low budget. If you're a horror fan of all kinds, then this Vincent Price cult-classic is definitely one to add to your collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing how film has changed over the last fifty years or so. The things that can be done now with computers and large budgets. Of course you don't need these things to make a great film. So many of the greatest Horror films were made with very little money and minimal effects. Take the work of the late William Castle, who made some of the most entertaining shockers of his time. He proved you can do a lot with very little and all these years later his films are still a treat. 'House on Haunted Hill,' which isn't a complete rehash of the same old haunted house clichés is one of his best.Pros: Good performances from the whole cast, all of which seem to be having a ball. Simple and chilling score. Nice cinematography. A spooky old mansion with interesting architecture. Moves at a decent pace. Lots of twists and turns. A few good jolts along the way. Has a good helping of humor, which is well balanced with the horror.Cons: Some plots holes. An ambiguous ending, but not the good kind.Final thoughts: Moves like 'House' may not compare to genre classics like 'The Exorcist' or 'A Nightmare on Elm Street,' but it's very good for what it is. Castle wanted to to both scare and entertain his audiences and he certainly accomplished both in this film. Some from this period have not held up so well, but this one is still pretty chilling.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House on Haunted Hill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This original House on Haunted Hill is an enjoyable thriller about a group of people who become forced to spend the night in a scary house. Fredrick Lauren (Vincent Price) invites five people to spend the night in a mansion with him and his wife. Once the clock strikes midnight, the gates will be closed and locked until the next morning. If they manage to stay alive by dawn, he will give each of them $10,000. The guests eventually arrive and we also learn that Fredrick's relationship with his wife Annabelle is very strained. It's revealed she even tried to poison him once before. The story behind the spook house is that a few people that lived there before were murdered and put into a vat of acid which still exists in the basement. Eventually Annabelle is found dead, hanging with a rope tied around her neck. One of the guests named Nora starts seeing her ghost and other scary things like heads appearing in her bedroom. Are all of the scares just a silly prank, or are the ghosts of the people murdered in the house haunting the living?This is a very fun and creepy little movie. I love watching these older fright films late at night, you really get a feel of how genuinely scary they were. This one has a bit of a murder mystery theme to it, as well as a supernatural feeling. There is a good twist which was copied in the 1999 remake, but not nearly as good. The vat of acid in the basement is a constant theme throughout the movie from start to the very end. The caretaker's old wife actually scared the crap out me when she appears from the darkness to scare Nora. The way she kind of floats along with that face. Very well done.This is a must see horror film. It is better than the remake and proves you don't need gore to make a good scary movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Spooky haunted house movie with the person who rented it Frederick Loren, Vincent Price, inviting five perfect strangers to spend the night there and getting $10,000.00 each in they in fact survive! The owner of the haunted house and one of those whom Frederick picked to spend the evening there Waston Prichard, Elisha Cook Jr, knows just how dangerous that place is in seven people, including his brother and sister in-law, having been murdered there over the last 100 years with their headless bodies found in different rooms!As the night begins and the house is sealed off from the outside world strange things start to happen driving some of the guests almost to the brink of insanity or nervous breakdowns. It's Nora Manning, Carolyn Craig, who ends up getting the worst of it with her seeing ghosts and severed heads pop out of the woodwork which no one else sees. Screaming her head off every five or so minutes it's a wonder that Nora didn't end up losing her voice much less her head by the time the film was finally over. It may have also been Nora's ear splitting screams that kept the ghosts or whoever it was from killing her by scrambling their brains, if they had any, before they could make a move on her!It's when Frederick's back stabbing wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), who wasn't one of the invited guests, was found hanged on top of a stairway that it became evident that something far more sinister and deadly was going on in the house besides just an active imagination on the part of those spending the night over there! ****SPOILERS**** It's later that the real reason comes out to what all this haunted house business is really all about and it has to do with an elaborate plan to commit the perfect crime by setting Frederick himself up for elimination. It's in Frederick expecting the unexpected that causes the "perfect crime" to suddenly backfire on those who planned it with them both ending up not only dead but stripped,in a giant acid bath, of almost all their earthy or bodily remains!Heart pounding final with the human skeleton popping out of the acid bath and doing what looked like a new of disco or rock &amp; roll dance step scaring the living hell out of the person, as well as the audience, who planned to do Frederick in! As for Frederick himself he in doing in those who tried to do him in he's now more then willing to face justice in that what he did, as violent and murderous as it was, was an act of self-defense on his part which no jury on earth, even in Communist Russia or China, would find him guilty of!P.S The other guest invited to Frederick's haunted house party are test pilot Lance Schroeder, Richard Long, head shrinker or psychiatrist Dr. David Trent, Alan Marshal, and newspaper columnist Ruth Bridgers, played by actor Robert Mitchum's older sister Julie Mitchum. Julie Mitchum or the character she played in the film Ruth Bridges survived not only her stay at the "House on Haunted Hill" but her famous kid brother Robert by some six years dying in 2003 at the age of 88.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the second William Castle picture I saw this weekend and it was a vast improvement over the horrible "Straight-Jacket." I would go as far as to say that "The House on Haunted Hill" is one of the best haunted house movies I've ever seen. It's got it all. There's a unique house that locks its victims in at midnight. There's its reputation for murdering anyone who is stupid enough to remain there overnight. There's a blind female caretaker who wanders around in the dark for no reason. And there's Vicent Price, who offers the perfect mix of black comedy and genuine spookiness.The only problem I have with the picture is its ending, which suggests that it was all Price's doing and that there are no real ghosts on Haunted Hill. Too bad, because the place is really a thriller. When I think of haunted houses, this is the one my mind will conjure up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House on Haunted Hill - One of the great classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a promise of a cash reward of $10,000, Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) invites a group of strangers to the supposedly House on Haunted Hill. The only stipulation: The invitees must stay the night in the house. . . and survive! As a horror fan, it's a bit of an embarrassment not to have seen some of the great classics. Even moreso when it's a very common classic. House on Haunted Hill is one of those films that, for one reason or another, I simply never saw. Vincent Price is one of my favourite horror legends, William Castle's a helluva director, and I love haunted house movies. . . but, I just never got around to this little wonder. I'm glad that I finally did. William Castle creates a very moody and atmospheric film, perfectly exhibiting the gloom of the House on Haunted Hill. Robb White's script contains enough humour and plot movement to keep anyone entertained, young or old. While there are some cheesy moments (ah, it's William Castle!), there are plenty of creepy moments as well. Vincent Price puts forth a great performance. While not his best (I'd have to lean towards Theatre of Blood as his best), it's one of my new favourites (solely out of the entertainment I got to watch as he strutted around the house in his sinister and maniacal way. Overall, there's not much more that can be said that hasn't been said tons of times before. If you haven't seen it, please hurry to. It's a staple of the genre and a fine piece of work.Final Verdict: 8.5/10.-AP3-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like at least one other here I saw this in a theater, in Memphis in 1959, when I was five. I clearly remember, to this day, EMERGO which was a 15-foot illuminated paper skeleton that ran in and out of the theater on a wire to the right of the screen. This was my first movie (in a theater) and I'm gratified to see from all the comments here that it wasn't just me being sensitive but a goddamn nightmare of a scary movie which it absolutely is. It was claustrophobically atmospheric in William Castle's own unique, low budget, way. I also saw 13 Ghosts in its first run with the color viewers and I saw a cheesy presentation of The Tingler at the Film Forum in NYC around '91 where at the moment the theater is supposed to go dark and selected seats are to start buzzing, instead a man jumped up into a spotlight and wrestled with a rubber lobster. Not nearly as impressive as a giant glowing skeleton that had just forced a woman into an acid vat! That and the severed heads marked me for life. If you like HoHH and want to see more Castle (the guy was a genius on so many levels and we will never see his like again) check out any of the Whistler movies, When Strangers Marry, Johnny Stool Pigeon, all of his classics from the 50s and 60s especially Strait-Jacket, The Night Walker, the previously mentioned Bug and Shanks, his final film, which Leonard Maltin calls "one of the strangest movies ever made". The last of the barnstorming producers! With a gimmick! His book is great too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Only the ghosts in this house are glad we're here"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I was expecting 'House on Haunted Hill (1959)' to be anything but a generic supernatural shocker, but there's depth to this 1950s B-movie. Ghosts are an ideal device for lazy horror filmmakers: add a few sudden shocks, ghastly deaths, and leave only one or two cast members alive by morning. But William Castle doesn't stick to the rule-book. His haunted house boasts no ghosts ? or, if it does, then they remain surprisingly quiet for this one night. Instead, Castle cleverly toys with the audience's genre perceptions; since we're all here to see a "haunted house" movie, we fully accept a plane of reality that would ordinarily send alarm bells of incredulity ringing. We're being hoodwinked. Our acceptance of a forged reality parallels the characters' acceptance. The best ghost stories ? Clayton's 'The Innocents (1961)' and Wise's 'The Haunting (1963)' ? are largely psychological, and here, too, Castle explores how carefully- choreographed scare tactics can wreak havoc on an unstable mind.At the request of his wife (Carol Ohmart), with whom he shares a mutual hatred, eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) invites five strangers to a "haunted house" party: the drunken and paranoid owner Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook, Jr.), jet pilot Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), skeptical psychiatrist Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal), gossip columnist Ruth Bridgers (Julie Mitchum), and timid typist Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig). Each of the guests is wary of the millionaire's invitation, but finds reassurance in the sorely-needed $10,000 that will await them if they can endure a single night in the "haunted" dwelling. Once locked securely in the house at midnight, with no opportunity for escape until 8AM, the party guests begin to experience surreal and unexplainable happenings in the dusty mansion, including falling chandeliers, frightening apparitions, apparent suicides, and some craziness involving a cellar vat filled with acid (an OH&amp;S hazard if I ever saw one). Central to this spook-fest is the young and pretty Nora, whose psychological condition rapidly deteriorates under the emotional strain.'House on Haunted Hill' naturally recalls the many thrilling ghost stories in cinema history, but the element of human intervention also reminded me of 'And Then There Were None (1945),' adapted from an Agatha Christie story. Since Castle consistently keeps us guessing whether or not humans or supernatural beings are responsible for the "hauntings," the viewer finds it difficult to identity moments of temporary security. For example, if a ghost is responsible, then the most frightening scenario is to be left alone; if another person is responsible, then the most frightening scenario is to share the room with just one other. The film, particularly in its latter half, has several scenes of extraordinary hokeyness (only amplified, I'd imagine, by Castle's trademark gimmickry), but also a few moments of heart-stopping terror. And it didn't help that, during the film, my dog silently pushed open the bedroom door, and then backed out again, so that from my angle it looked as though the door had eased itself open.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahh what can I say about this movie? It has Vincent Price in it. No matter how you look at it, he's a wonderful actor. I liked his role in this movie too.But I am getting ahead of myself, let's talk about the story first: A millionaire invites 5 random people to a 'party' in his house. The house is rumored to be haunted. The man promises that anyone who stays the night and lives will receive a fat 10,000 $. As time goes by, however, it becomes clear that something else is going on in the house. Something unnatural... or maybe not?It's a very enjoyable film, if you are a fan of the genre. It's part horror, part mystery and part drama. I liked the acting in this movie, and not just Vincent on his own this time.Even though the large amounts of screams tend to get annoying after awhile...Nonetheless, House on Haunted hill with Vincent Price is certainly a worthy watch.7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill (1959) is a classic horror movie, that is arguably the best of the haunted mansion sub-genre films. It is almost a who/what-dunnit film. It has a mysterious, macabre feel to it throughout.The film is about a party being held at a rich couples mansion. Vincent Price, who plays the millionaire owner of the mansion, plays a rather odd, man-of-few-words character. The party entails that for whoever can stay the whole night shall win $10,000 dollars. The idea of the party is not Frederick Loren's (Price's) idea however; the idea is that of his wife. However, it is Frederick Loren who picks the participants.It is clear from the outset that the rich couple have a strange relationship, with the wife seemingly wanting Frederick Loren dead, and Frederick Loren having a shady past, with 3 other dead wives.The film has a very dark atmospheric feel, and uses noises to create scares; for example creaking doors and ghostly sounds. As such, we don't really see much in the area of ghosts throughout the movie, and what you have is a mystery; you don't quite know whether the mansion is haunted or not. There is also exquisite cinematography, and use of lighting all which vastly add to creating the macabre feel of this movie.The acting in the film is a double-sided coin. Some of the performances are particularly good. I think you can possibly guess that as usual Vincent Price puts in an awesome performance. He has a looming presence, dark and mysterious, but seeming rather charming and austere at the same time. Carolyn Craig, playing the cute, naive, rather childish Nora Manning also puts in a memborable performance. She in many ways fills in the protagonist role, as you have someone you are routing for to survive.The rest of a cast does a respectable job, but none really stand out.The film also has a cheaply made movie feel, but utilises it very well, relying on a cleverly written story that is told at a speedy pace. The film isn't action packed, but is a twisting turning tale of murder, mystery, the supernatural and the dark side of humanity.A must see for horror fans, film-noir fans, fans of who-dunnits and the like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HOUSE ? is a respectable horror; it was intended to be a classic, it is deliberately and resolutely classic. As the host of the party, Price does a Dracula?like performance (without, of course, the Transylvanian crap exoticism, and with some supposedly stylish dandy touches ?).None of the characters has any individuality. HOUSE ? is,in this respect, very much alike that '30s mysteries. The music enhances the emotions; the atmosphere is well done. The film does not go beyond the effects.The movie is notably trying to induce the idea that the modernist architecture is weird and frightening; much of the atmosphere depends on this (wrong) premise. I have read that the house used for the exterior shots is a '24 Wright creation. It looks rather like a _ziggurat. For me, this was the least convincing and stupidly reactionary part?Wright's house is not frightening at all; it is bizarre and vaguely Asian, but not fright?inducing. The choice of the house was wrong to begin with.At least some of the scenes are mishandled from a dramatic and narrative point of view; the tone is several times semi?serious, as the film oscillates between straight horror and goofy _divertissement. Anyway,it's not without finesse. The fright is not brutal, but well?dosed.HOUSE ? reminded me, at least for a time, of Bullwer Lytton's short story?where there is the same will of effects, without resolutely achieving its goal.Horror collectors should have it?as well as treasure it ?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Castle's single most delightful fright feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suave, but eccentric millionaire Frederic Loren (the great Vincent Price in peak smoothly ingratiating form) invites five complete strangers to a creepy old house for a special birthday party he's holding for his faithless and treacherous wife Annabelle (an exquisitely bitchy Carol Ohmart). If the motley quintet of folks survive the night, they will be paid $10,000 each for their troubles. Director William Castle, working from a clever and inspired script by Robb White, relates the absorbing story at a steady pace and does a sound job of creating a suitably eerie atmosphere. Moreover, Castle plays the material straight and keeps a serious tone throughout; he also adds a welcome sense of wickedly sardonic humor and adds a downright infectious feeling of pure fun to the enjoyably uncanny proceedings (you gotta love the freaky old lady on roller skates and the hokey, but cool walking skeleton). The sharp dialogue crackles with barbed wit (favorite line: "Darling, the only ghoul in the house is you") and the double twist surprise ending is a doozy. This film further benefits from excellent acting from a tip-top cast: Although Price clearly dominates the picture with his commanding presence, he nonetheless receives fine support from Richard Long as gallant test pilot Lance Shroeder, Alan Marshal as skeptical psychiatrist Dr. David Trent, Carolyn Craig as the sweet, fetching Nora Manning, Julie Mitchum as washed-up newspaper columnist Ruth Bridgers, and, best of all, the always terrific Elisha Cook, Jr. as the house's timid'n'twitchy scaredy cat owner Watson Pritchard. Carl E. Guthrie's crisp black and white cinematography and Von Dextor's rousing ooga-booga shivery'n'shuddery score add immensely to the macabre merriment. A total treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of this review, spoken by the great Vincent Price in his trademark macabre voice, is one of my favorite lines in William Castle's "House On Haunted Hill" of 1959. An impossible-not-to-love spooky classic that no Horror fan can afford to miss, this film unites all the great qualities that my fellow fans of classic Horror love about 'Haunted House' gems of the silver screen. The film has a great, gloomy atmosphere and an immense sense of macabre wit. Vincent Price is, as always, brilliant, and the role of the eccentric millionaire Frederic Loren fits Price like a glove. This film allows Price to show his great talent of playing sinister characters with a sense of macabre humor like hardly another. This film furthermore has a special value to me personally, as Vincent Price is one of my all-time favorite actors, and a long time ago this was the first of his films that I saw, and I immediately became a fan of this brilliant horror icon. Since then, many years have passed, and I've seen almost every movie with Price, most of them more than once.The eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Price) invites five strangers to join him and his wife in a party. This 'Haunted House party' is to take place in an eerie mansion owned by Loren, and each guest who will stay for the entire night is to receive 10,000 Dollars. The house is not just eerie looking, however, it also has a history of violent murders...The film maintains its wonderfully eerie atmosphere throughout, and it has quite a bunch of exquisite scare moments. As mentioned above, Vincent Price is, as always, brilliant. The other performances range from very good to poor. Julie Mitchum is fantastic as Price's character's equally sinister wife, and Elisha Cook Jr., who played besides Price in quite a bunch of Horror classics including Roger Corman's "The Haunted Palace", is good as always. My only regret with "House On Haunted Hill" is that I will never be able to see the film in its complete theatrical glory. When the film was first playing in theaters, director William Castle used his trademark gimmicks for additional scares. These gimmicks included skeletons flying through the hall, directly at the audience. Unfortunately, the only way of experiencing "House On Haunted Hill" in an entirely perfect manner, would therefore be to either go back in time, or to find a theater-owner and a team willing to stage everything the way Castle did, both of which is very unlikely. Incomparably eerier than the 1999 remake, this original "House On Haunted Hill" is a magnificently spooky Classic Horror gem and an essential must-see for every fan of Horror! My high rating for this film mirrors my personal love for this movie and might be seen as exaggerated by some. However, this is probably the single movie I have seen the most often, and I still enjoy it immensely. To me, it is an absolute must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Price definitely earns his cult status...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Vincent Price movie, this time he is an eccentric millionaire that offers $10,000 to five strangers in return for spending the night in his haunted house. If the deal sounds fishy, that's because it is. The first thing I thought was, Wow, this sounds like a reality television show... except for with murder, special effects galore, and a lot more deceit. I think the best part about this movie was watching my eight-year old sister, a huge horror film fan, gasp and scream and react to the film, which she wholeheartedly enjoyed. Intellectually, The Last Man on Earth has a lot more to grab onto, but The House on Haunted Hill has the cheap thrills, screams, and moments of suspense that have undeniably made it a cult classic. I suppose I enjoyed both features equally, but as far as being an audience favorite, this movie surely stands the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enough horror schlock - it is time to go back to a classic. With few exceptions you cannot go wrong with Vincent Price, there is something about his deadpan deliveries, and overly stoic demeanor that can creep out a Jell-O television commercial. And this movie delivers. OK there are its share of "what the..." moments but the rest of the movie makes up for it.The music, atmosphere, and most of the acting (other than Goober McGhee the owner of the house) really lends itself to the ending. And for once the skeleton animation is supposed to look like a Harry Housen masterpiece. My only question - What purpose did the old lady serve? I guess we will never know. I am sure I will watch the remake - but I am afraid that the special effects and high budget will neglect the atmosphere and general feeling of paranoia that makes the original a classic.Must have for your horror collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Fun This Was in Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something to be said for a society that could be scared much more easily than they are now. These late fifties and early sixties horror movies always filled the bill. There was always a hand reaching from behind a curtain to touch a young lady's shoulder, there was always a room where we shouldn't go, there was always Vincent Price. In addition to the introductions at the beginning which I love, especially Elisha Cook, there are all the dark wonderings put forth for us to chew on. Right on cue, something would make us jump, a few minutes would pass, and there it was again. I remember when skulls and skeletons could drive anyone to hysterics. They are tame now; we want more gore, dismemberment, disfigurement. This is a nicely paced mystery story. It could be pretty average but for Price's consistently eerie presence. He is so pained all the time. I imagine he has been seen as the villain in almost every film in which he appears, but we always wonder. The young woman in this movie supplies enough screams for everyone, and well she should. She seems to be the one that is being used over and over. We have the handsome Richard Long who is consistently skeptical as his young romantic lead tells him story after story. She is being set up to shoot Vincent. And then the house, which looks from the outside like a sports museum, has the secrets. Cook keeps reminding us that seven have been killed. He is an absolute mess but we need someone to keep the ghostly element involved. Did anyone think it might be a good idea to do something about that vat of acid in the basement. Did anyone stay in their rooms when all mayhem was breaking out. It doesn't matter because this movie is what it is. A spook show for a Friday night in the late fifties.</fullReview>

Frederick invites five random strangers and offers $10,000 to anyone who makes it through the night. my thoughts: This is a very fun Vincent Price ghost film. It has a good plot, creepy music, the characters are well casted, and I love the now stereotypical setting. The dark, creepy mansion (even though it used to be a prison). Vincent Price really made this character and this is the movie that made me love the guy (I haven't seen any of his films earlier than this and THE BAT).This is an almost flawless ghost film even though the effects and acting don't always hold up today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) at the behest of his most recent wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart) sends out five invitations to five different individuals from various walks of life who all have one thing in common: they all need money! The offer Loren makes to each individual invited guest is that if he or she will spend one night in the infamous House on Haunted Hill, where ghosts, haunting and murder has long been the norm, Loren (or his estate should he not survive the night)will pay that person $10,000 in cash! A mighty tempting offer but one which may well be at the cost of their very lives.What makes this such fun viewing time and time again is it has a wonderful, almost inescapable charm that invites you warmly in and then takes you firmly within its grasp. One of William Castle's finest efforts, this is your basic old dark house style murder mystery similar to the type so popular in films from the 1930s and 1940s where horror really isn't as much at the forefront as is suspense and intrigue. Sure there's several plot holes to be found if one examines things too closely but with scene stealing performances from our leads particularly Price, Ohmart and the disturbingly nervous Elisha Cook Jr., who really cares? This is grand fun even if the climactic effects are not pulled off as expertly as we might like. In the end, you should have had your fill of frights and fun. Notice how I keep repeating the word fun. It's the word that perhaps describes this film the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film as a child, as a Saturday afternoon chiller on some rinky-dink UHF station; in fact, it's probably one of the earliest films I remember seeing. I was captivated by Hill House, its gruesome stories, and the bizarre hold it had over the characters. At the time, most of the movie went over my head (and seeing it cut to pieces to fit broadcast television surely didn't help). But I find that, now that I am capable of following the twists and turns of the plot, I only love it more.All the things that drew me in years ago are still cool - the creepy caretakers, Elisha Cook, Jr.'s haunted expressions, the blood dripping from the ceiling, the head in the suitcase, the vat of acid in the basement, and a dozen other creepy visuals. "Rich with atmosphere" doesn't even begin to describe it.But now, on top of that, there's the complicated who's-trying-to-murder-whom plot line, presided over by Vincent Price and Carol Ohmart, both obviously reveling in the opportunity to play such vicious, spiteful, wicked people. Each believes they've set up this little party to murder the other, using the other party guests as pawns in their deadly game. This is a brilliant piece of work featuring several genre favorites at the top of their form. Bypass the cheeseball remake and see this film, instead. You'll thank me later.</fullReview>

Seems that Vincent Price has invited 5 people to spend the night at his haunted house.If you survive you walk away with $10,000.The 5 are given little coffins..with guns in them.The fun begins and we're treated to secret passageways,moving corpses,levitating skeletons,a hanging woman and a pit of acid. A few murders are thrown in to liven things up even more and some double &amp; triple crosses tossed in. One of my favorite all time movie lines is in this film.Price to his wife (Carol Omhart):"Remember the fun we had when you poisoned me?". This film is played with tongue in cheek.We get a wink and a nod as the film moves along.Price is very restrained in this role and comes off quite sympathetic.The cast plays it very well and you should be entertained and have fun along the way!</fullReview>

We have the Mr. Loren (Price) who is the throwing this freaky party for a wife who hates him, a psychologist who studies hysteria, a jet pilot, a gossip columnist (she didn't have a purpose in the film), a young typist who works for one of Mr. Loren's companies and the drunk who owns the place. The drunk tells about all the creepy things and deaths that have happened in the house, (check out the vat of acid in the basement) and then creepy things start happening to the visitors. One is attacked in the dark, the young woman sees ghosts, and Mrs. Loren is found hanged. This freaks everyone out and they hide out in their room (as they are locked into the house for the night). Well, they start to come out to see what it going on and then something interesting happens. Scooby Doo would have loved it. The movie is B level horror, no name actors other than Price, grainy picture and so forth, but the story and twist make it a little better than average.This movie is like a Jr. Hamburger from Wendy's. It's a little better than a McDonald's hamburger, a little less greasy, and the square patty is cool, the condiments are kept to a minimum (how else do they sell it for 89 cents). It really is mostly bun, but once in while the level of meat and ketchup can surmount the breadiness and make it a decent hamburger. 5.5/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The spookiest movie I ever saw!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the spookiest movie I ever saw in my entire life! I was scared out of my underwear! The top 2 scariest things was when the freaky lady came. I knew it was the caretaker's wife but I wondered how she floated. In and out of the movie.I was so scared of that part because her pupils were missing! only ghosts can remove their pupils! And the other thing. I always wondered how she floated. Did they hang her from a thick string? I always thought that was it because it seemed the most possible and because I noticed her shoulders were going up. The next scary thing was when the skeleton came out of the acid. The weird thing about all scary or horror movies (except "The thing" because there were no women!)is every time at least the woman is scared first. This time the host played the trick on his own wife! I was so scared I felt like I was going to faint! You might wonder what I meant by tricked. The weird thing was that even in the movie, it was all a trick. A plot. The most absolute scariest part was at the end. In exact dialog, the narrator said, "then they'll come for me, then they'll come for YOU!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightfully devilish performance from Vincent Price makes for a truly wonderful and creepy experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this chilling haunted house tale eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) offers five strangers $10,000 to stay one night in a sinister house with a murderous history. William Castle's classic haunted house flick is a testament to the quality of atmospheric, low-budget horror films that talented directors were able to produce back in the 1950's and 60's. Made for a mere two hundred thousand dollars, the movie captivates and enchants the viewer from the very beginning with truly eerie introductions from protagonists Frederick Loren and the slightly troubled Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook). Castle proficiently uses these opening monologues as the mood-setter for the film and one immediately becomes acquainted with Price's famous devilish charm. Some basic, yet wonderful visual shots of the cars approaching the ominous mansion act as the perfect catalyst for the audiences anxiety; a feeling which is managed and increased dexterously through Castle's breathtaking direction and superb use of lighting nearly all the way through the picture. Throughout ?House on Haunted Hill' there is a constant, unpleasant but welcome eeriness that lacks in so many modern horror films and while there are only maybe two or three truly startling moments, the continual foreboding tension of the piece is overwhelming enough to genuinely grab the viewer and absorb them into the world. How appropriate it therefore is that during Price's opening speech he essentially invites the viewer to bare witness to what unfolds during this fateful night. Of course, like all low-budget films there are flaws in the production which are rather noticeable. The storyline of the film seems to become somewhat confused and drawn out during the final third of the movie but picks up enough at the end to leave the viewer feeling satisfied. One could suggest that the virtuosity of the first half of the movie led to its own downfall during the second. With a horror movie such as this that begins with such malevolence and cunning, it is always difficult to continue to appreciate it when the movie fails to deliver later on what the early stages gave the viewer by the bucket full. Even so, the relative short running-time of the production allows for such problems in pacing and chills, and while one may start to become a little uninterested in the events periodically there is always a swift return to standard not too far away. During the sporadic moments when the story takes a minor turn for the worse, one can always be entertained by the remarkable character interaction and entertaining dialogue (as written by Robb White) and in particular, the performance of one Vincent Price. As usual, Price is commanding on-screen and convincingly portrays his calculating and baleful character. The early interaction between the character of Frederick Loren and his wife, Annabelle (Carol Ohmart) allowed Price to fully assert his character's persona into the film. These early scenes also aptly set the viewer's mind to work in figuring out just how this night will end. The two warring spouses are joined by Elisha Cook who is pleasant in his role as Watson Pritchard, despite being painfully irritating on minor occasions. Carolyn Craig also joins the cast as Nora Manning, a young woman quickly driven to apparent hysteria by the seemingly supernatural happenings in the house. It is a credit to Carolyn's acting ability that her performance was not only convincing but also commanded sympathy on occasion from the audience. The only real negative point one can give regarding the casting of the film was the inclusion of Julie Mitchum in the role of Ruth Bridgers. One has to question the point in including Julie in the production when for the vast majority of the movie it is far from obvious that her character is even there. One particular piece of dialogue towards the beginning gives the impression that she was only included to make up the numbers.Despite some flaws, ?House on Haunted Hill' makes great viewing for the horror fan. While not up to the standard of amazing haunted house films like ?The Haunting' (1963), ?The Legend of Hell House' (1973) and ?The Changeling' (1980), there can be little doubt that ?House on Haunted Hill' is generally creepy with a couple of truly staggering moments. Not quite as predictable as one may expect and with a final plot-twist that displays a hint of originality, the movie is a horror-mystery which benefits from fine direction and forceful performances, especially from the legendary Vincent Price. My rating for ?House on Haunted Hill' - 7?/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is possibly the finest Horror film of the 1950's. The excellent plot and the brilliant acting from the legendary Vincent Price makes an alltogether great film. This film's plot revolves around Annabelle Loren's crazy slumber party where all the guests must live through the night in the supposedly haunted house, if they survive, her husband Frederick (Price) will pay them $10,000 each. The film has a dark plot, with characters ranging from the rich Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) to the very nervous owner of the house. This film is one of the defining horror films of the 20th century and needs support. Grab it while you can!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cinematic Masterpiece That Almost Was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have nothing against bad films, particularly in the horror genre. In fact, my collection is split between the great masterpieces (Nosferatu, Dr. Caligari, Night of the Living Dead) and the best of the worst (Glen or Glenda, They Saved Hitler's Brain, the Evil Dead series), but the one thing I have no tolerance for is a film that starts like a masterpiece and ends like, well, something else.House begins well enough. Pitch black and scary sounds that are actually kind of scary set a brilliant tone. Elisha Cook's floating head then makes for an awkward first visual, but his unsettling acting quickly compensates. From there on in, Vincent Price takes the stage (as he properly should). The premise is interesting enough, and the acting is mostly acceptable (with the exception of Carolyn Craig, who's been bashed enough in these reviews). Carol Ohmart is, in contrast, a jewel of an actress who truly holds her own in scenes with Price. Hers ultimately becomes the only character with whom I feel any connection in this film.But what really sets the tone for this film is the cinematography. The camera does an excellent job of manipulating in highly subtle ways. It always manages to find a door or passage way in the background, which the actor does not see, leaving us to wonder if anything will come out of it. This is done in a very subtle way that hardly calls attention to itself. Similarly, there is no change in pacing or character movement, whether a character walks across the room and gets attacked by a monstrous hand or not. The camera bluffs quite well, never letting you know what's coming.Unfortunately, after only a few short scenes, the movie falls on its face. The special effects are fourth rate, even considering the time period. Severed heads are hardly recognizable, and never deserving of a healthy suspension of disbelief. Worse yet, the climax of the film is utterly ruined by poor effects. Shown out of context, the dancing corpse would make for a fantastic laugh. At least the writers find a way to explain this utterly lousy effect, but the drama is quite lost by the time any explanation is delivered. Worse yet, the film presents itself as a horror with a strong undercurrent of clever mystery to it. It's actually structured as a "Who Dunnit?" parlor mystery; a ghouls and ghosts version of Clue. Yet the final explanation is thoroughly unsatisfying and full of holes. It explains almost none of the film's bizarre occurrences. All in all, this is probably a film everyone should see, if for nothing more than its brilliant potential (and let's not forget Vincent Price), but don't expect much more than a lot of screaming and running, prompted by dancing skeletons and plaster of Paris severed heads.</fullReview>

It certainly was a good movie at it's time. But we simply aren't watching the movie to it's fullest effect. The best effect of course is how they did it in the theater. Having a skeleton come out of the screen certainly would get my attention. Seriously, the movie is hardly a haunting. There is no ghosts in this movie. It's totally set up by clever ol Price and dogtagged by the paranoid idiot. At 74 minutes in length, I'm amazed how much different the 1999 version took it out. These two movies cannot be compared. The storyline is simply and utterly different. One is about murder, the other is death by ghost.Still, for a $5 dvd, it certainly is a bit of fun to watch. If you need a good laugh, this will certainly do. :)4/10Quality: 7/10 (still has some great camera shots) Entertainment: 4/10 Replayable: 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill has all the elements of a classic spooky horror flick, including the sinister talents of actor Vincent Price. In it, he plays a charming millionaire with a dangerous game in mind for his "haunted house party" and a large reward for the winner... the problem is, there's something in the house that doesn't want them there... is it one of the guests? Is it Frederick's wife, Annabelle? ...Is it a ghost? By today's standards, this little movie looks incredibly lame; the effects certainly aren't what they are today. But that doesn't really matter, the story is timeless and the acting skills are outstanding, these actors make actors today look like garbage! The soundtrack was great too, very eerie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another William Castle Blockbuster. I couldn't get past the half-hour mark but evidently others have -- and enjoyed it.Price owns a haunted house and offers ten large to each of five diverse guests if they can stay the entire night. There have been multiple murders, and there's a vat of acid in the cellar, and so forth.The guests include a middle-aged woman, a handsome young jet pilot, a beautiful young typist, and a greedy psychiatrist, as well as Price himself, who will spend the night with them. Ho hum.You want to watch a decent ghost story that takes place in a haunted house. Watch the original "The Haunting." Even "The Legend of Hell House" is an improvement.Of course my prognosis may be mistaken. You should see what happens when I bet on a horse. Maybe the rest of the movie, after that first half hour, blossoms into a genuine nightmare.You may see several warnings about not allowing kids under twelve to watch it. Ignore them. They're sale gimmicks thought up by Producer/Director Castle to infiltrate your mind, hijack your limbic system, and set you up for frights that simply won't come out of their closets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (William Castle, 1959) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In view of the fact that the film under review and THE BUSY BODY (1967) were going to be the only films of centenary celebrant William Castle which I had watched but not written specifically about (since I was not yet into the habit of doing so when I did many years ago), I decided to do something I have not done in ages: revisit movies I was already familiar with! Apart from being Castle's sophomore (and far more successful) effort in his newly-found vocation as a gimmicky schlock- meister, it was also one of Horror movie icon Vincent Price's earliest stints in the genre he would soon grow to become most associated with for the rest of his prolific career.For some reason, the copyright of this popular Allied Artists production ? which should have made it the exclusive property of Warner Home Video ? was allowed to lapse into Public Domain and there have been dozens of DVD editions of it over the years (apart from the legitimate one from WHV, that is) including computer-colorized versions that are also available in their entirety on "You Tube"! As for myself, my first viewing of the film came via a triple-feature DVD rental ? along with the Boris Karloff vehicle THE GHOUL (1933) and Roger Corman's A BUCKET OF BLOOD (1959) ? that I later managed to own a copy of, while this revisit came via a pristine, anamorphic, high-definition print courtesy of "You Tube"?Although the only other recognizable names in the cast were handsome former second lead Alan Marshal (as a shady psychiatrist) and ubiquitous diminutive character actor Elisha Cook, Jr. (as the drunken, doom-laden current owner of the titular abode), eccentric millionaire Price is matched in the acting stakes by his duplicitous on screen partner, fourth wife Carol Ohmart; the obligatory romantic second leads then are left in the shaky hands of Richard Long (who gets bumped on the head at one point) and Carolyn Craig (who gets to scream her head off when meeting all kinds of scary mischief during her tenure). Anyway, the film is perhaps the most popular of Castle's work in this vein ? being a trim and fun ride, ably mixing the chills with a tongue- in-cheek attitude that really evokes the "old dark house"-type films of long past (and which both Price and Castle would return to, much less effectively, in the disappointing 1959 and 1963 remakes of THE BAT and THE OLD DARK HOUSE respectively). Incidentally, since the central setting is supposedly haunted ? which should make the title HAUNTED HOUSE ON THE HILL(!) ? it renders Castle's subsequent and already lame 13 GHOSTS (1960) even more redundant!!; still, the phantoms never really show up here?since the curiously floating "ghoul" that does appear ? which provides the film with its single biggest scare and which was imitated in last year's haunted house blockbuster THE CONJURING! ? is actually the aged caretaker, while other apparitions and monstrosities emerge to be man-made creations in the long run!!Indeed, while the film plays like a campier (Castle has the 'floating heads' of Cook and Price introduce the history of the place and the party invitees respectively at the very start) retread of older, hokey "haunted house" properties, it also anticipates the "dare" factor present at the outset of Antonio Margheriti's CASTLE OF BLOOD (1964) and its colour remake WEB OF THE SPIDER (1970) ? in which it was Edgar Allan Poe who was making the wager! ? and the "scientific" aspect prevalent in Robert Wise's overrated THE HAUNTING (1963) all down the line to the aforementioned THE CONJURING itself. Needless to say, the genial director cooked up a doozy of a gimmick ? dubbed "Emergo" in this instance ? for the original theatrical screenings of his picture where a yellowish skeleton is raised and floated about above the heads of the audience during the climactic sequence in which the real villains of the piece are getting their own (somewhat unconvincing) comeuppance on screen at the hands of a similar mechanically-operated device and a conveniently opened vat of acid in the dungeons! I ought to mention, in conclusion, that I watched the film's 1999 remake before I had a chance to check out the original?as was also the case with the 2001 version of THIR13EN GHOSTS ? but not, for what it is worth, THE HAUNTING (also 1999) all of which, as if it needed saying, turned out to be inferior to their prototype!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very elaborate murder plot by Price's fourth wife and her shrink lover. Carefully selected guests are promised $10,000 each if they can survive from midnight until eight in the morning. Even though this is 1959 the special effects are not that good. Price knows his wife and lover are conspiring to do him in and turns the tables on them. Supposedly shot by one of the guests, (the guns were loaded with blanks), Price exacts his revenge against his wife and her lover by throwing the lover into an acid vat. He then scares his wife into backing in to the vat using a rather fake skeleton. While not stated at the end of this movie I guess the four remaining guests get the $10,000 each. One of the remaining guests whose brother died in the house looks at the vat and says he is next, that they are coming for him next. Trying for a sequel???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie's outcome wasn't even cogitated in my mind. I saw teen Hollywood remake of this picture last year, and that made me think this would be the same story, just made in a different decade. Yea, I was wrong. Whilst 1999's version was made to scare a young audience, this one has a different objective. This version is very classy, with good performances-- most of the time-, and too few scare scenes. In fact, it takes about 40 minutes of running to deliver a scary moment-- which made me prefer watching this in daylight. After that and some few moments, we discover there is not bad spirit, haunted house or anything, but just a farce to kill main character's wife. In my opinion, it has too much talk and too few action. I was lured in to this movie for a different reason. If you're looking for a scary movie with a good story, see the newest version. However, if you're interested in pure art and some different stuff, this may be the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Castle and Price Make the Perfect Pair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eccentric millionaire Fredrick Loren (Vincent Price) and his fourth wife, Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), have invited five people to the house on Haunted Hill for a "haunted house" party...The concept itself is rather gimmicky, as is the standard William Castle fare (and the same for his trusty script writer, Robb White). But it works -- oh it works. You might even say the plot is a variation on the "Ten Little Indians" story, with you never knowing who is going to survive in this isolated location.While the draw of the film as far as actors go is clearly Price, two others are worth singling out. Richard Long provides the good looks of a B-movie actor. Although forgotten today, following this film he became something of a TV star on the shows "Big Valley" and "Nanny and the Professor". Long does a fine job playing the story's hero (if there is one) and semi-romantic interest. Sadly, he had a heart attack at age 47.Watson Pritchard (played by Elisha Cook) is the strongest character, going through a broad range of fear and drunkenness. Cook was a character actor for decades, making his mark in "The Maltese Falcon" (1941) and never slowing down. Pritchard could easily be considered among his best performances. Carol Ohmart will be familiar to horror fans from "Spider Baby".Historian Steve Haberman thinks this is William Castle's best film, and believes that as Castle's budgets increased, his films decreased in quality. This is a highly controversial statement, though perhaps not entirely incorrect. Haberman thinks this role was the one that made Vincent Price famous to audiences. Perhaps. He had already done "House of Wax" and "The Fly", but were either as big as this?The film has unfortunately fallen into public domain, as copies are readily available, and most of them rather blurry. The Netflix version could definitely use an improved picture and sound. This version seems to be the same one lampooned by RiffTrax. Fortunately, Scream Factory has included it in their second Vincent Price box set, looking and sounding quite nice, with plenty of supplementary features, including an audio commentary with film historian Steve Haberman (which is informative, albeit not overly insightful). As of 2014, this is easily the definitive version to own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't need to watch the 'modern' rehash of this campy 50s horror classic because I have the original and modern remakes tend to be pointless,politically correct and totally inferior in every way! There are certain scenes that stay in my mind and the best generally involve Price...for example, down in the cellar with the acid bath as his character dispatches his tiresome wife into the afterlife with what is supposedly his own ghostly skeleton...only it's hard not to notice that where he once towered over his wife, she now towers over his bones. It's an hilarious scene.So too is the one where the grizzled old bat of a house keeper seemingly floats along the cellar floor. In typical 50s horror fashion, the lead female (the one the evil wife and doctor are trying to drive insane) is expected to scream....a lot. This film over does that...I generally mute the TV when I know she's about to let rip! Vincent Price is his usual hammy self...he seems to be really enjoying himself...it's hard not to join him with House on Haunted Hill! The remake's 'guests' maybe offered a million bucks apiece rather than the ten grand of the original, but I know that inflation won't have improved the telling of this story one jot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Price and Ohmart are near on perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allegedly rousing Alfred Hitchcock to make the horror film - Psycho (1960), and while the setting is not as lavish as The Haunting (1963) the House on Haunted Hill is an entertaining 50's movie.Eccentric millionaire Fredrick Loren played wonderfully by Vincent Price invites 5 people to the house on Haunted Hill for a "haunted House" party and they'll get $10,000 if they survive the night. The quirky house owner, Mr. Pritchard is played entertainingly by Elisha Cook Jr. and the rest of the cast are good enough.Vincent Price is without a doubt the best thing about the film oozing charm, wit and panache. What is interesting and worthy of note is Robb White's writing of the adultery plot that build the tension and interaction between Price and Ohmart. They are reminiscent intensified versions of the characters in Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder (1954).While the stories 'twist' is well developed the large modern 50's house story is not. There are some creepy moments that include the striking Carol Ohmart as Annabelle Loren but the lighting and sets are so crisp it fails to create any real brooding atmosphere and sadly a movie of its time, the women shriek a lot.Should the house itself has been more traditional this may have been a near on perfect black and white chiller. Still, it's good fun and worth checking out on a quiet dark night if even just to hear Price's deep tones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With having seen Vincent Price as Egghead on re-runs of the Adam"Family Guy"West Batman show,and hearing his voice-over work on the fun 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo.I,decided when i spotted that my dad was about to trade in a film the Price starred in,that i would make sure to get hold of the film,before it got traded.Happily,i found the film to be very enjoyable,with a surprisingly clever story. The plot:A millionaire and his current wife (his other wives have strangely disappeared,or have died in very weird ways.)decide to host a party in an alleged haunted house with five "random" guests (though some of them have connections to the millionaires business,the history of the house,and,one of them is having an affair with the wife.)When the guests arrive at the house,they are each told that,if they stay there for the whole night,they will each be given $10,000.Whilst this may sound like an easy thing to do to everyone,things start to get very disturbing,when,the millionaires wife commits suicide by hanging herself. (Though she has oddly hanged herself from a celling,which is far to tall for her to ever reach.)Some of the guests (the lover of the millionaires wife being the main one)have some horrific plans of their own,which make the ghosts not the only thing that they have to survive threw the night. View on the film:I feel that whilst William Castle is most remembered for his "shock and awe" publicity style(lovingly re-created in the film Matinée.)that,the screenplay by Robb White is impressively very strong and pretty original for its time.With,the wife and her secret lover setting up the haunted house as one big con job!,in order to make all the guests so nervous and spooked,that they end up killing her husband.Unsurprisingly some have the special effects have not aged to well (the shot with the older woman running across the room,looking like a card-board cut out moving across the screen)Thankfully the films aged effects are covered by a very good cast,with Vincent Price and his very fantastic voice giving a very enjoyable performance. Final view on the film:A very good film,with a great script that sadly,has some very creaky looking special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghost story, murder mystery, or both?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My continued viewings of horror and Halloween-themed movies and TV throughout this October have led me now to House on Haunted Hill, a 1959 movie starring Vincent Price. Price is a millionaire named Frederick Loren who offers five strangers thousands of dollars just to stay at an alleged haunted house for a night. This looks like a case of a rich man exploiting the needy for mere amusement- or is it something more? The owner is one of the five- a rare case of someone being paid simply for spending time at one of his own houses. He's not comfortable there, however, and warns that the ghosts will bring death to the group.The guest I was most interested in was Nora, and much of the movie centres on her. At one point she runs into a ghost of a freaky-looking old lady, getting a jump out of me. But then it turns out she's not a ghost, but rather a caretaker. This foreshadows how for the rest of the movie, we see no actual ghosts, and have no proof the house was really haunted. Hitchcock's Vertigo, which came out in the previous year, similarly looked like it was going to be about a woman possessed by a ghost. Then it turned out to be an act covering an elaborate murder plot. Here, too, deception and murder plots drive the story. It was good of them not to discount the possibility that the place may be haunted, though. We don't see the group surviving their stay at the house, so who knows, maybe they were attacked. This is a movie good for a mystery and for fun, but it's not as deep as Vertigo.Happy Halloween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a very campy and overacted, though it is well-made considering its plot, and good for a couple of cheap thrills. House on Haunted Hill is surprisingly entertaining. It is rather lame though, if you're expecting something scary. Despite the fact that it is blatantly campy, it's a very fun movie. You just can't except much, it being a mainstream horror movie from the 50's. When I saw this movie, I was really into watching Horror. I also wanted to watch something scary, and whenever something wasn't scary enough, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. But in retrospect, it's actually a pretty good movie. I did jump once in the movie, though only because of a disfigured face and a sudden loud noise. I can imagine House on Haunted Hill not being scary even the year it came out. Movies like this are probably what you would want to show your kids if they are interested in horror, and you know it's not time to show them the Night of the Living Dead. It could be used to give them a little taste of the horror genre. It is really good for something like that, or if for some reason you are in the mood for an old campy movie. It should do the trick for that too. Though it does not stand out too much as a great horror film. It has a few scenes that really scream 1959, when it was made. I wouldn't recommend it as a scary movie, but if you just want to have a good time watching an old movie, then this might be for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Eccentric Frederick Loren and his wife have invited five guests to a 'house' party at the mysterious mansion on Haunted Hill, which is reported to be inhabited by evil spirits. Each guest is given a small coffin holding a gun and is informed that those that remain in the house until sunrise will receive $10,000. Frights and thrills fill the night as nerves are put on edge and the guest's (sic) secrets start coming to light," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.Vincent Price (as Loren) wouldn't need to spend $10,000 for many overnight guests in real life; because, the man is simply too entertaining to deny. Mr. Price, and gimmickry director William Castle, make the movie enjoyable. Writer Robb White contributes some clever dialogue. Of the guests, Elisha Cook, Jr. (as Watson Pritchard) seems to be having the most fun. Carol Ohmart (as Annabelle Loren) and Richard Long (as Lance Schroeder) are in fine form. In hindsight, parts of the story don't make any sense; but, without them, the story wouldn't move, either. So, check your brain at the door, and don't stand under the chandelier! ****** House on Haunted Hill (2/17/59) William Castle ~ Vincent Price, Carol Ohmart, Richard Long</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great tongue-in-cheek horror from that patron saint of 1950's teens, gimmick-meister William Castle. In this one, luminescent skeletons were supposed to sweep through the audience and scare all the girls into the clutches of their hormone-driven dates. Now, maybe that happened in some theatres, but not in mine. Probably our geniuses couldn't get the contraption hooked up right. Anyhow, as I recall, I got a peck on the cheek at the front door and was two dollars poorer, counting the popcorn.But the movie's still a lot of fun, with a good twist ending you can't see coming. Five people are invited to spend the night in a spooky old mansion, and get $10,000 each if they don't die of fright first. Never mind that this "old" mansion looks like it's out of the 25th century with interiors out of the 17th, or that the jet jockey guest is named Lance Schroder-- ever hear of a fighter pilot named Melvin or Herbert? But who cares since the host is that grand old humbug of horror Vincent Price, at his arched-eyebrow best. Stealing the show, however, is everybody's favorite fall-guy, wide-eyed Elisha Cook Jr. as the constant voice of doom. He's got basically one line to repeat for every occasion-- "Guns don't do no good against ghosts". Yeah, right. Probably the easiest paycheck he ever picked up.I'll bet Castle made a bundle on this. It must have cost about 50-bucks to make. The whole thing never leaves a corner sound stage at what must have been Budget studios. But considering all the horny teens of the time, I'll wager this little exploitation flick out-grossed many big prestige films of the day. Okay, it's 50 years later, the special effects look like the stone age, and my last look at teen years was when Ike was president. But, I bet you'll still get a few jolts and have some fun figuring out the neat twist ending. Now, if only I could find that long lost date, maybe I could get a lip-smacker this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite thriller. A horror movie for people who love a comedy. "Playboy kills wife with Champaign cork would make an excellent headline" is one of my favorite movie quotes of all time. It may have been scary by the standards of 1959, but when I watch it now I can't help but laugh. Did Vincent Price's character kill his wife in every movie he starred in? Why does Price's wife always cheat on him with a doctor?(Don't believe me, watch Pit and the Pendulum.) Maybe Price just should have avoided doctors, or doctors should have avoided Price. Also, I acknowledge she was scared, but at the end why didn't Annabell realize that her husband's skeleton was 3/4 her husband's height? Oh, and beware of the blind women on roller blade...

Really very good fun.Solid direction, a good (if traditional) score and a thorough knowledge of archetypal horror sensory triggers (slamming doors, slow turns showing lights switching off...) makes the movie far, far creepier than I initially expected.Unfortunately, when it comes to the 'big reveal', the special effects were so unbelievably dismal that its more likely to provoke laughter...Still, good fun.

Most people have stated that $10,000.00 was a great deal of money in 1958 and that is true. If you go along with the consumer price index for 1958; $10,000.00 is equal to $65,600.00 at 2005 prices. I thought I would send this in for the sticklers for detail out there. Also, I would be interested in finding out if anyone might know how many of the on screen characters were still alive? From what I have been able to figure Julie Mitchum was the only surviving one. Also the caretaker and his wife would have had to be in on it with Mrs. Loren and the Psychiatrist because they showed up to scare the young girl and ended up locking everyone in the house before they could decide to leave or not. It's too bad that was not mentioned somewhere in the finished editing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to today's horror films, this 1959 black and white film would be considered innocent but there are some genuinely creepy moments. The sudden appearance of the creepy looking blind woman in the cellar room that then floats out being the one moment that really stands out in my mind. I actually rewound and replayed that little gem. Don't expect to loose sleep over it though. The movie takes place in a haunted house, surprise surprise. They could have made the house a little spookier but, hey, they didn't want to scare the kiddies too much. In 1959 that blind lady floating out of the room would have probably sent the kids onto their parents lap, today it was pleasantly creepy. There are some other stand-out moments as well, especially the conversations between the loving couple, Price and Ohmart, who play husband and wife, as they discuss the various methods she has used thus far to kill him. The characters are well played and the plot is great! I always thought this type of plot had so much potential and there have been a number of movies made on this premise but few live up to their potential. There was a remake of this movie made in 1999 with Geoffrey Rush but it can't hold a candle to the original and, though the premise was the same, they went more for the blood and guts than the creepy and eerie. If you've seen the remake and didn't like it, don't let it keep you from giving the original a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, actually no I don't, but the lovely Carolyn has a scream to be reckoned with: Shrill, piercing and guaranteed to send shivers down anyone's spine! If there were such an Oscar category as a ?Best Scream', she'd surely be a strong contender.Haunted Hill is great Sunday afternoon fun ? a light fright flick with Vincent Price superb as a dashing and deliciously wicked villain.The film is pretty light on scares (although one little scene made me and my viewing partner nearly jump out of our skins) and the story pretty thin and silly, but there's loads to enjoy in this 75 minute feature. The house itself looks great in black and white ? surreal, foreboding and sumptuousMy biggest annoyance with Haunted Hill is that it starts out with a tantalizing premise and an assortment of shifty-eyed, odd ball characters (the middle aged female columnist and gambling addict is my personal favourite), but the ensuing plot doesn't make use of the premise as much as it should and the characters aren't fleshed out anywhere near as much as they could have been. Still, we're talking William Castle here, not Stanley Kubric so one can't complain too much.Overall, Haunted Hill is great fun for a rainy weekend afternoon. Thin, yet satisfying.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horrors of architecture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This delightfully silly movie populated by likeable actors, greatly filmed and scored, can be viewed either as the horrors of ghostly intrigue, or as the horrors of architecture, of structures built for the glory of the builder, rather than the comfort of the residents. Ghosts seem to prefer expensive mansions to mobile homes. Having been freed of life's constraints, they want to live it up for a change, and they don't seem to like sharing big houses with mere mortals! "The Haunting" scared me as a youngster. This one amused me even then. One thing seems certain: you can't have a horror film without a big, unwieldy house. Architecture shapes our lives to an extent that can only be qualified as horrifying. I guess one could say that architecture is the mother of history. Architects should see this one. The true horror master may be Frank Lloyd Wright. </fullReview>

The action is gimmicky with some shocking and chilling moments and Price makes the perfect host, even though he's a little dull in this one. Carol Ohmart plays his scheming wife with Carolyn Craig as a tormented guest. Richard Long plays the typical strong, fearless and rational hero.

		<shortDescription>THE classic William Castle horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle will always hold a place in my heart for reasons two-fold.First, he majored in horror movies when I was a boy in the fifties. Second, and more importantly, he was the master of the "gimmick" horror flick. The Tingler, 13 Ghosts, Mr. Sardonicus, and House on Haunted Hill all had a special gimmick to bring in the audiences.The last was his masterpiece. A truly frightening film. Not scary due to special effects, but due to atmosphere. In this day and age the advancements in special effects, especially CGI, allow any director with a budget to "show" you the horrific. Back in the fifties, horror had to be suggested on the screen, but created in your gut, in order to work. On haunted hill, you could feel the house in your gut.SPOILERS AHEADBy setting up not only the characters but the house itself as a possible source of malevolence, the horror felt real. The head in the box, the ceiling that dripped blood on the hands of the next possible victim, and the walking skeleton all trod the line between the possibilities of having been planned by someone in the house, or being actions of the house itself.The old woman floating across the basement floor may be the scariest moment in all of the fright films of the fifties.FILM END SPOILER - GIMMICK EXPLAINEDAs to the gimmick, unfortunately you'll never get to enjoy it. But when I saw this as a boy in 1958, it was the coolest thing I'd ever seen in a motion picture palace. I sat in the balcony as the film's final scene unfolded. A skeleton rises out of the acid pit in the basement and approaches Annabelle Loren (Carol Ohmart) the wife of Frederick Loren (Vincent Price). It manouvers around her until she, retreating, walks backwards and falls into the acid pit.Then, to my utter amazement, the skeleton walked out of the frame and began to float out over the audience towards the balcony. As it neared the top, you could then see Price on screen, operating the fake skeleton that he'd used to murder his wife. The fact that you were viewing a fake skeleton on wires in reality, while on screen Price manipulates a device consisting of wires and pulleys made the combination of cinema and live action a seamless and logical fit.Obviously, when you see the film today, you'll miss the thrill of celluloid becoming flesh. Or lack thereof.But it represents the pinnacle of William Castles use of a gimmick to make his films stand out from the crowd. The fact that it appears in the film that was his best regardless of gimmicks is what makes House on Haunted Hill well worth a look.BTW, in case you're wondering, I'll illuminate the gimmicks attached to the other films I mentioned.For 13 Ghosts, glasses were handed out that resembled early 3-D glasses. Made of paper with one red and one blue lens, patrons were advised to put on the glasses and cover one eye if brave enough, the other eye if frightened of ghosts. The film was black and white, the ghosts depicted in red. So if you looked through the red lens, the ghosts dissappeared. The blue lens allowed you to view the ghosts.For Mr. Sardonicus, the story of a man who robs a grave for a valuable ring, there were two different final reels available to the theatre management. When it was time for the story's final reel, the house lights would come up and an employee would take to the stage to conduct a vote. Depending upon the will of the audience, Sardonicus would be saved, or meet a horrible end.The Tingler, was shot in black and white, but blood in the film was in color. The lynchpin of the story is the concept that fear, if not alleviated by a scream, can kill. A creature, the tingler, grows on your spine when you're frightened, and is eliminated when you scream. The gimmick? The theatre seats were wired with a mild electrical shock. But more than that, in the final scene, a tingler would scurry down the theatre aisle.All of these followed House on Haunted Hill. But the films themselves were just ok, or worse. House however, stands on it's own, gimmick aside. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This line from eccentric millionaire Vincent Price was delivered to his statuesque blonde beauty wife Carol Ohmart in their first scene together discussing marriage, money, jealousy...and murder. It's a great scene, beautifully acted and written, and sets the stage for this entertaining William Castle horror drama. Price invites 5 guests to his "haunted house" party and if they survive the night will be offered $10,000 each the next morning. There's some genuinely creepy scenes, great black &amp; white photography, marvelous music, plot twists, etc. The rest of the competent ensemble cast includes Richard Long ("The Big Valley" TV series), Alan Marshal, Carolyn Craig (whose reason for attending: "We were in an automobile accident, I'm the only one who can make any money." Hope they're all not paralyzed.), Julie Mitchum (Robert's sister) and Elisha Cook, Jr. Craig screams a lot, and quite hysterically, in contrast to Ohmart's more mature, operatic outbursts. Price plays the role tongue-in-cheek, even offering as party favors, loaded pistols! Ohmart relishes her gold-digging, cheating wife part. Avoid the abysmal, bloody, CGI-infected 1999 remake at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of both Vincent Price and William Castle, so it was pretty much a no-brainer that I'd like this film. However, maybe not for the reason that I usually like Castle films - to laugh at B-movie horror flicks.'House on Haunted Hill' is actually a pretty darn good movie. Sure the special effects aren't the greatest, but it was made in 1958 for crying out loud. Vincent Price's performance as the slightly psychotic Fredrick Loren is one of his better roles - he is absolutely believable (and a little bit scary).The movie has some great horror story elements, like the two disembodied heads that show up in the oddest places (and are said to whisper to each other at night), blood dripping from the ceiling, an old hag who 'glides' across the floor, a haunted house, creepy caretakers,... the list goes on and on.But the REAL reason this film gets a big thumbs up from me is that despite its age, despite its lack of realistic special effects... I still got startled watching it!!Watch this movie - you won't be disappointed. And bring a friend, because as you'll see - two heads ARE better than one.

I have seen other black and white movies that just plain were not scary and didn't have anything really good in them like "Night Of The Living Dead" in black and white. I thought it was gonna be just another cheesy old movie when I first sat down to watch it and it had those heads of Pritchard and Vincent Price talking and I thought that was kinda stupid. But when it got into the story I actually found myself liking it more and more. Since I had seen the Remake first I was kind of watching for the things that happened in it to happen in this version but they never really did. What really shocked me was when that creepy old lady made me jump. It didn't scare me but it made jump a little bit. I must say that it has a lot of very good makeup and creepy effects for such an old movie. Not as good as the remake though. The remake was way better and way creepier but as for the old one.

Not as stinky as udder flicks in the vein, the original "House" does make use of some pretty feeble special effects,and some tawdry over-acting. Moore of a who-dunnit than a true horror moovie (all the fake effects were actually meant to be fake), the film does nonetheless showcase the wonderful creepy acting talents of Vincent Price. Severed heads, murder by acid, dancing skeletons, and suicide by hanging are all on the evening's agenda when eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren(Price) invites 5 udder people to spend the night in his haunted mansion. All they have to to is survive to the next morning to cowlect $10,000, but everyone seems to have a hidden agenda, and then the plot become confuddled and cowfusing. Part of the problem of the film is that only about 1/2 the characters are really used to do anything; the rest seem moore like incidental fodder. And no one does anything that normal, intelligent folk would do in the same circumstances - like stay together, keep the lights on, keep your hand revolver ready, etc. Still, as a showpiece for Price, such incowsistancies are forgivable. With the right attitude, the original "House on Haunted Hill" can even be enjoyable, say, as part of a campy moovie festival on Halloween night. This is the flick that made use of Castle's "Emergo" effect - which was to have the moovie theater drag a dummy ghost over the audience, while the actors on screen react to it as if it were on the film. I suppose in the 50's, this moost have been horribly frightening, but I'm sure modern audiences would simply howl with laughter, much as the MooCow did. Not scary enough to be a classic, not stinky enough to be true cow flop, the MooCow says this "House" is worth checking out at the right time &amp; with the right audience. And if a fake dummy ghost flies over your head while you watch it...well, don't say you weren't warned by the MooCow. ;=8)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The House on Haunted Hill was one of the better, and scarier, movies shown on "Creature Features" on Saturday nights back in the early seventies. It's a classic Vincent Price horror movie, in which he invites 5 guests to spend the night in his "haunted house" for ten grand. Most of it's pretty campy, but there are a few scenes that jump out at you and can still be scary. And the twists and turns are pretty fun too. Interestingly, it was filmed on location at the Ennis House, a Frank Lloyd Wright designed house that was also a location shoot for Blade Runner, seen as Harrison Ford's apartment.</fullReview>

There are twists and turns and just when you think you know what's going on, BAM!, they hit you with something that alters how you perceive this movie.

		<fullReview>Among the films of William Castle, House on Haunted Hill stands as testimony to the success one can achieve with a great atmospheric theme. While the plot is somewhat lacking, the real draw is in the mood of the film: powerful storms, a maze-like haunted house, paranoid guests brandishing pistols against a menace that may or may not be real. From the opening sequence showing the arrival of the strangers, escorted in hearses, to the final pan out the door of the house as sinister laughter fills the air, this movie manages to make the skin crawl and will undoubtedly cause the audience to look over their shoulders a few times. To anyone looking for a good thrill to enjoy alone in the dark, this movie offers exactly what's needed.</fullReview>

The special effects are strictly 50s but that only adds to the nostalgia factor.

		<shortDescription>Lame haunted house movie highlighted by the stunning Carol Ohmart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1959, "House on Haunted Hill" stars Vincent Price as the host of a "party" at a mansion where several people are invited (e.g. Richard Long and Elisha Cook Jr.) and offered $10,000 to stay the night. Ghostly and spooky things start happening. Will they make it out alive?Some old horror movies stand the test of time even though they're extremely dated, like 1953's "House of Wax," but "House on Haunted Hill" isn't one of 'em. This is just a bad movie. It has one or two effective scares, but that's about it. Thankfully, there are some positives: Price is his entertaining self, Long is a quality protagonist and Carol Ohmart is palpably sultry, but there are way too many lame elements, like parts of the dialogue and the overall script. But there's more: The corny floating heads; the overacting and over-screaming (mostly by Carolyn Craig); the fact that the house (actually a veritable castle) only has one door; and the ridiculous skeleton at the end that was shorter than Annabelle and was supposed to be the remains of Price's towering character. Then there's the obvious questions the story provokes: Since the guests were only there for the night why not just stay in one room together and wait it out, making sure you're not sitting under a dubious chandelier? What was the purpose of the well of acid in the cellar? How did they possibly pull off Annabelle appearing outside Nora's window? How about the rope encircling Nora's feet and then going back out? Why didn't Nora simply step away from the rope? I could go on and on.Still, it's worth watching for the few positives and to roll your eyes at the rest. Shot in B&amp;W, the movie runs 75 minutes and was shot Ennis-Brown House, Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. GRADE: D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much has been written about this little gem of a film that I'll just add one detail. The old blind woman who "floats" around in the basement gives me chills 50 years later. Every now and again, when I'm wandering about in the dark, I'll think of that "wall tapping" scene, and find myself scrambling frantically for a light switch. I don't know what it is, but no moment in horror films has the power to scare me like that one. I remember as a kid, the worst practical joke I played on my kid sister was to wait until she had gone down into our creepy basement and play the creepy music from my old cassette recorder through the forced air heating duct. Of course, I would first turn out the lights from the switch (at the top of a rickety old staircase). She would utter screams that were not unlike those of Nora Manning. Ah...the things we do as kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House On Haunted Hill is a great example of a talented cast putting over something that has very little substance to it. Vincent Price is an eccentric millionaire who with his wife Carol Ohmart throws a party where five ostensible strangers are invited and offered $10,000.00 to stay the night. Not his house mind you, but a comfortable out mansion that's just a bit haunted.One of the guests Elisha Cook has a connection to the house, a couple of his relations got murdered there. In fact seven murders occurred there in the past. The other guests are Richard Long, Carolyn Craig, Julie Mitchum and Alan Marshal.It's emphasized how much of a cash flow problem these randomly selected guests have. Otherwise if someone offers you that kind of money for one night's stay in any house, most of us would know there was a bad gimmick attached and would flee from that offer.In the end though it's proved that some guests are not random and some have some really human motives for the events that take place.House On Haunted Hill was made on the cheap and does not have the gore that a lot of Vincent Price movies have. This film was made at the beginning of the horror cycle of Price's career. It's a great tribute to his talent that it could frighten as it did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I do think that Vincent Price has done better overall movies(Theater of Blood, Abominable Dr Phibes and Witchfinder General). But I cannot deny that as always, coming from someone who was supreme in this film genre at this particular time, he is brilliant with a charismatic presence and great deadpan delivery that will give you chills and excitement at the same time. He is well supported by Carol Ohmart, Alan Marshal, Richard Long and especially Elisha Cook Jnr, who plays the paranoid drunk with real exuberance. There are many other joys to House on Haunted Hill than the cast. I for one love the Gothic production values, as well as the suitably creepy atmosphere, haunting music and witty script that is in perfect keeping with the tone of the horror movies of the time. The story apart from the short length and one or two meandering subplots is very clever with some memorable moments such as decapitated heads, witches and acid vats as well as a fun twist. All in all, spooky slick fun with a great atmosphere and performance from a genre icon. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Castle's greatest motion picture is in fact House on Haunted Hill, a timeless movie that still provides as a great horror film today. The house guests are terrific characters and are intriguing to watch inside the supposedly haunted house. Is the house truly haunted? It's anyone's guess as it could be ghosts terrifying them or a little back stabbing going on. Vincent Price was great and the scenes with the mail female lead experiencing her frights in the house were awesome. It's a short movie so its a good movie to pick up if your low on time or aren't feeling a full length film. Check out House on Haunted Hill if you are a real horror fan.

It is about a group of people who try to find out who the killer in the group is.I really liked the plot of the story and the actors in the film, especially Elisha Cook Jr. who played Watson Pritchard. Watson starts the film off, and he never takes that "creeped put" look of his face throughout the whole film, which really helps bring the horror to the viewers. The only thing I thought didn't fit in with the movie were the ghosts, I think that they could have been a bit more scary and threatening to the actors.

		<shortDescription>A fun but very far-fetched haunted house horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director William Castle is known for the crazy gimmicks that he concocted to help promote his horror movies; for House on Haunted Hill, he devised 'Emergo', where an inflatable glow in the dark skeleton on a wire would be suspended over the audience during the film's finale. This type of ridiculous cinematic showmanship sums up the entire film for me: it's undeniably a lot of fun, but perhaps a little too preposterous for it's own good.Castle's characters are well defined, his cast is excellent (particularly Vincent Price and Carol Ohmart as the film's bickering married couple), the dialogue is witty, there are some solid scares, and the multitude of genre clichés that proliferate House on Haunted Hill are guaranteed to put a smile on the face of any fan of spooky movies?we get a secret room accessed by a sliding panel, an acid pit in the cellar, a pair of creepy caretakers who look after the house, and all manner of things that go bump in the night?but as entertaining as all of this is, it can't quite make up for the completely implausible nature of the plot, which doesn't just require its audience to suspend disbelief, but to disregard logic entirely.As amusing as it is to see a creepy old hag float silently past the film's petrified heroine, a corpse levitating outside a first floor window, or a walking skeleton slowly advancing on the villain of the piece, if it doesn't all add up by the end (which it most certainly doesn't), then I can't help but feel a little cheated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this when ITV used to broadcast their " Don't Watch Alone " season . This would involve an old monochrome horror film being shown at 11pm on a Friday . With hindsight they were rubbish but to a young imaginative mind they were terrifying and HOHH was the scariest one of the lot . One scene that put my hair on end was the scene where a character taps on the wall only for a blind woman to appear in the frame . My dad had to reassure me that the blind woman was in fact a dummy a fact reflected in the way the woman left the room ( Obviously pulled along on a rope ) seemed to make the scene more unearthly and petrifying not less . It's certainly a film that gave me nightmares Seeing it again it's not something that's going to give anyone the shivers . In its favour it does have atmosphere but the scary setpieces are surrounded by lots of long talkative scenes . What really let's the film down to a critical adult audience is the unlikely plot . It's effectively a film of intrigue and setting up the perfect murder but what this involves is someone doing something to someone at a certain location at a certain time also ensuring that no one else is around to witness events . It's one of these things that whilst working in cinematic convention would never EVER succeed in reality because there's too many variables and outside factors concerned . Alfred Hitchcock described this as " The Icebox Effect " where the audience watches a film thinking " Wow that's clever " , go to the fridge to get another beer out of the icebox and then as they pull the ring they suddenly get hit by realisation that things are contrived rather than complex or clever</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is 4.30pm on a Sunday afternoon in October 1959 and I am sitting inside the cavernous and decaying 3,000 seat Eros cinema ( the old Hippodrome theatre ) in Catford, a suburb of south London. The joint is jumping because today " Emergo " has come to town. The lights dim and the censor card appears on the screen. Certificate " X " passed for exhibition only to those persons over sixteen. At least a quarter of the packed house are somewhat underage, but the theatre management dare not refuse entry, because to do so would have provoked a riot, such is the anticipation for William Castle's latest cinematic treat for horror fans. So, on with the show, and the main attraction is first up, because the management want to get in three showings of it, plus two showings of the supporting picture. The velvet smooth voice of our host Vincent Price bids us enter the " House on Haunted Hill ". Gasps and screams ensue as the mayhem unfolds on screen, but after an hour we are wondering just when the thrills will fly out at us as promised on the posters outside. Many of us think we will witness some form of 3-D. When the ballyhoo boils down to a plastic skeleton trailing across our heads, many feel disappointed but, so what, the film was scary enough without the need for all that nonsense, and after the intermission and a sixpenny tub of ice cream, we still had " Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman " to relish. This was the first time I saw the lovely Allison Hayes in a film and my goodness she could muster up a good scream, especially in that desert scene when her Imperial grinds to a halt and she is molested by the giant from outer space.

		<fullReview>You ought to know the plot like the back of your hand, but just in case..Wealthy(..and multiple-married, with three wives dying under mysterious circumstances)Frederick Loren(Vincent Price), thanks to his wife's wishes(..sort of), offers five specific chosen guests an opportunity to collect $10,000 if they are able to survive the night in supposedly haunted house owned by alcoholic Watson Pritchard(Elisha Cook, Jr)who claims that lives were taken by ghosts always passing warnings to them. We see in their quietly sinister conversations that Frederick and fourth wife Annabelle(Carol Ohmart, quite alluring)that the marriage is failing as the idea of murder-for-profit is continually mentioned. Frederick uses oozes biting sarcasm subtly, but expresses his point that she will participate in his little game whether Annabelle wishes to or not. The film often consists of typist Nora(Carolyn Craig most of the time screaming or in a state of hysterics)running from various threatening elements within the rooms, jet pilot Lance(Richard Long, a veteran of the classic sci-fi horror show The Twilight Zone)doubting Nora's claims of spooky goings on(like a woman "floating across the floor" or finding a severed head in a case), Watson in a frozen state of fear foretelling great horrors that lie in wait for them, Dr. David Trent(Alan Marshal)often trying to play the voice of reason during difficult situations, and Ruth(Julie Mitchum)as a common victim of blood spattering on her hands from the ceiling. When Annabelle is found hung from a rope dead(supposedly, from what Trent proclaims), it's obvious that Frederick becomes the likely suspect. He always appears to be the kind of person who would stage such an event(he does mention his fear of being killed by Annabelle one way or another siting a past incident where she possibly poisoned his food)because we see a glee when discussing surviving the night in the house, his little coffins with loaded guns, and the idea that murders could very well happen. Frederick's smiles always seem to express malicious intent. In other words, he doesn't seem trustworthy in the slightest. You couple Annabelle's murder with a possibility of the supernatural within the house they're staying, anything could happen. But, as in many a William Castle film, there's always twist to the proceedings and appearances can be deceiving.Perhaps THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL doesn't contain the blood curdling terror Castle intended, but I still think it a lot of fun. Certainly the whole business with the skeleton and acid pit at the end is ridiculous concerning a scheme that seems like the perfect crime gone down the tubes, but the film never claims to be anything more than an entertaining movie the way Castle was able to produce for the public time and again. Even if Castle is not given his proper due as a fine filmmaker, his movies live on and continue to thrive regardless of those who consider him nothing but a PT BARNUM of the cinema of the 60's. I thought the interplay between Price and Ohmart was the juiciest part of the film. One problem that did bother me..I wanted some extra development for the creepy housekeepers, the Slydes(Leona Anderson is the wife who floats across floors and resembles an old witch, while Jonas, portrayed by Howard Hoffman, continues frightening Nora).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill (1959, Dir. William Castle) Story Frederick Loren has invited five strangers to a party of a lifetime. He is offering each of them $10,000 if they can stay the night in a house. But the house is no ordinary house. This house has reputation for murder. Frederick offers them each a gun for protection. They will all arrived in a hearse and will either leave in it $10,000 richer or leave in it dead! Actors As the movie was produced in 1959, I have no knowledge on the stars what so ever, with the exception of Vincent Price. He plays a wonderful role, with even the simplest of actions seeming sinister. All the other stars seemed to portray wonderful characters which seemed so realistic. Carolyn Craig is the perfect helpless victim and her screams are so terrifying.Music Like many old horror films, the soundtrack is simply scary. The composer really knows how to add to the already creaking atmosphere of the film. It's just so perfect for this type of film.Special Effects I was quite surprised about the special effects in this film. They are well made and the make up is quite mysterious and can be considered scary. When the old lady appears looking like a ghost, I did genuinely feel freaked out by it.Conclusion Old black and white films are often a mixed bag for me. Sometimes I love them and sometimes I loath them, but 'House on Haunted Hill' was a surprise hit. I really enjoyed it and found many scenes in which I would either laugh, or sit in horror. If you're a fan of modern horror films, I recommend giving this a go as its a lot better than most horror remakes these days."Come with me murderess. Come with me." ?

		<shortDescription>A tasty cheese stick from the dollar DVD dumpster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Again and again I've said that a trip to Wal-mart for a dive into the dollar DVD dumpster will usually cough up a lot of phlegm, but an occasional gem (I'm a poet and don't know it). On a dive last August in Veradale, Washington, I found William Castle's House on Haunted Hill. I found it to be 75 minutes of pure, unadulteratedly campy cheese. In HHH, actors you may or may not recognize get to panic and scream and plot against and slaughter each other in Grand Guignol style, all on a shoestring budget.I remember watching this movie on the Saturday Afternoon Creature Feature on KHQ in Spokane, a good forty years ago, and all I could remember from the movie, when I found it in the vat of DVD's last summer was the big pool of acid used to kill, then strip the flesh off various victims in the movie. My idiot teenage sister and her idiot girlfriends, over for an afternoon of video cheese-whiz, screamed and shrieked at the campy assassinations (and I think they invited me into the rec room to watch it with them in order to let me know how they would like to deal with me, an obnoxious 8 year old).I haven't seen the 1999 remake, nor do I really want to. The only reason I kept this silly little horror flick is that as long as I have it in my disc collection, we'll never be short of cheese sticks.Besides, I haven't watched the movie on the flip side, "Attack of the Obnoxious 8 Year Old."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Price stars as Frederick Loren,an eccentric millionaire who invites five strangers to a party at a haunted house and offers them $10,000 if they stay through the night."House on Haunted Hill" is a haunted house horror classic.The film was obviously inspired by Shirley Jackson's creepy novel "The Haunting of Hill House".Vincent Price is excellent in the main role,the rest of the cast is also splendid.There are several clever plot devices and plenty of twists to keep the viewers entertained.It's worth noting that William Castle used unusual and effective gimmick to promote this film.The gimmick this was called "Emergo" and the process was a plastic skeleton that sailed over the audience's heads on a guy wire.Overall,I loved "House on Haunted Hill" and you should too,if you are a true horror enthusiast.The remake by William Malone is very mediocre,though.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit to never having seen this film all the way through.However as a child back in 1967, when I must have been five, a double bill of this film and "The Projected Man" (1967) were playing at my local flea pit. I was much to young...of course to attend, but remember having to walk past the posters which were on the wall next to our local chip shop. They absolutely terrified me. The house on haunted hill showed a huge gothic house, the skelaton and Vincent Price holding a severed head. The projected man showed a man looking into the camera, his hand outstretched. The only unusual thing here was that his hand and face were transparent and you could see all the veins, and muscles underneath. I was absolutely terrified and had to cross the road. This was the moment, along with watching Hammer's "Curse of Frankenstein" at the age of 11 when I knew I would want to make horror movies in later life.</fullReview>

It may seem campy to some, but this work is great. We have an old spooky house and a couple of plans in the works... plans that rival the sting in their use of the other sides knowledge against them. This needs to be "rediscovered" and placed on DVD so the next generation can see a horror movie can be a psychological tour and not a gore story. Vincent Price is so believable in the role, even when he is guilty, when he says he is innocent... something makes you want to believe it! Excellent film, and still fun for all ages!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd stay in that house</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess that it's debatable whether or not Vincent Price was the greatest horror star ever, but "House on Haunted Hill" certainly suggests so. He plays Frederick Loren, who is offering five people $10,000 each to stay in a possibly haunted mansion overnight. Part of the deal is that no one is allowed to leave. To complicate matters, his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart) appears to have some slimy plans up her sleeve. Meanwhile, one of the guests, Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook, Jr), is adamant about telling the other guests of the evil things that happened in the mansion ("This is where the girl was found. Whatever got her wasn't human!"). As you might imagine, things get progressively weirder and creepier for the guests as the night drags on.1959 may have been the annus mirabilis for both Vincent Price and William Castle, as they collaborated on this movie and also "The Tingler". Some people may classify "House on Haunted Hill" as another one of the horror movies that dominated '50s cinema, but I beg to differ. This movie is Americana, far more than apple pie or baseball. It's not just that these sorts of movies were a life-saving alternative to the "family fun". They WERE the '50s: 100% campy and 100% lovable at the same time.So are you ready to stay at this house?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Send in the floating heads! Castle gets to employ one of his popular horror motifs in the opening sequence as a superfluous prologue from two of the film's main characters (Pritchard and Loren) provide some unnecessary details on the adventure to come. What do we know? There will be wretched screams and menacing moans, also that we are dealing with a haunted house, and that the characters have all been invited to this house by an elusively-motivated millionaire host. That is to say, we already know too much. This direct address prologue is on-the-nose and should have been out the window. Speaking of windows, what's up with that rope? Subjective paranoia and supernatural spooks start to blend well in this film but rely a little to heavily on contrivance and diversion. Haunted Hill is a very self-reflexive film text with only one elegant and genial introspective moment (Price's Loren character coyly glances at the camera as he passes by it just after the first real spook moment from within the house). Is Loren the mastermind of terror or hapless victim of forces beyond his control? The question was played out soundly in this original and the Malone remake. Although the story of Haunted Hill does not thrill, the directing is quite proficient. If I remain true to my own thesis (Castle directed well only the good scripts he worked with) then surely I am not valuing this story as I should. Castle compensates for my criticism through good staging/blocking (old lady spook well foregrounded in the frame) and strong use of the long take and mobile framing (creating a sense of psychological presence for the spectator). This film is more genuinely amusing than Macabre but is rife with silly contrivance which tends to disrupt the pace and tone. The highlight of the film (nope, not Emergo) is the Ohmart-Price banter (significantly better than Rush and Janssen in the remake). The Loren marriage relationship drives the narrative as it should. There are some clever moments in the story that spark questions about the nature of spook contrivance, namely that perhaps the story is told from the warped psychology of one of the characters (maybe even emanating from the 'injured head' of the seemingly most stable character). Price's own character unveils his 'Emergo' contraption near the end, which of course was accompanied by Castle's Emergo "live" version put right into the theatres at the time. The gimmick is far-fetched and digressive from the story itself, but I imagine it was a lot of fun for audiences at the time. Castle was now beginning to get himself a reputation as a producer-director worth supporting. He was also finding success at the box office which would bode well for the production value of later films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this is small-minded, but it really ISN'T a "house on haunted hill." It's a haunted house. On a hill. Of course, "The Haunted House on the Hill" has none of the resonance of the true title, so I get why it is what it is, but still....And, of course, the "hill" has nothing to do with the movie. At the outset, we see the hearses approaching up a long, winding road -- that's good, as are the shots of the car interiors with each character clutching the long strap that (I guess) hangs on the inside of the back seats of hearses. Then there's the (hilltop) house, which looks like Prince Valiant's getaway. But it would have been nice if, somehow, the "haunted hill" aspect played more of a role. Ah well....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill (1959) is a classic horror movie that has aged remarkably well compared to most films of the time. The overacting, that often defines this genre, only occasionally appears, and even Vincent Price remains remarkably understated (by his standards, at least). The director William Castle, whom many consider the "low-budget" Hitchcock, keeps the audience off balance with superb pacing by alternating scares and plot twists to wonderful effect. Whether you are a fan of the genre or not, this classic movie illustrates that the strength of storytelling and acting far outweighs the power of modern special effects.

Strangers come together out of greed, with no common past, no reason to trust or distrust each other. Strange sounds and subtle touches make everyone jump, and no one knows who to believe. Throughout the film you don't know if there are ghosts, or if it's some kind of trick. There are enough coincidences to make you wonder, but that's all. "Less is more", and it's just right.http://www.hulu.com/watch/70582/house-on-haunted-hill</fullReview>

They tried remaking the movie in 1999 but it also didn't live up to its expectations. i liked the original (this one) better than the newer one. Knowing the technology they had in 1999 they could have most definitely done way better. Some of the older movies are scarier than movies today but that's not all the time.

It was it and I thought that there would be more to it but it just felt unfinished. Then there is a head in the beginning talking but the movie felt raw. I wanted to know more and what would happen but I was disappointed by it. It had some nice little twists in it too.

		<fullReview>I like Gothic horror when it's intensely artificial, there's something about an obvious studio set of a mansion with dusty furniture and cobwebs strategically placed that I find delicious, and House on Haunted Hill operates a lot in that closed space filled with the musky smell of decaying redwood panels and heavy velvet drapes. William Castle does a lot of silly things there, like Ed Wood almost daring us to buy the sight of a puppet skeleton pushes a woman scared out of her wits into a vat filled with acid, but there's gleeful satisfaction in all this. Like Vincent Price in another diabolical role, Castle relishes the opportunity to scare his audience and there's some sense of simple honesty in all this. In the end, the title is as misleading as everything else in the movie, there's nothing to indicate ghostly presence, but a spooky faced Elisha Cook Jr tells us the ghosts are coming to get him, and we may be next!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't just being a straight-forward horror flick, it actually is a movie that got well written and relies more on its mystery and tension than on any gore or ordinary horror clichés.The story has a couple of nice twists to it and while watching this movie it becomes obvious that the writers really spend some time penning it down. The could had easily turned this piece into an ordinary standard haunted house flick but luckily they didn't. For the normal genre standards this is simply one fine and above all also original entry into the '50's horror genre.But yes, the movie is still above all things a real horror flick and it also does have some good scares in it. Due to it's build up and also original approach of the genre, the horror gets made more powerful and it's moments work out better. '50's horror flick aren't exactly known for their subtlety or credibility but this movie does a great job at putting down a convincing movie with a good story and characters to enjoy.It's a movie that is more light and more enjoyable to watch than the average genre attempt from the same era, without loosing any of its strength as an horror.It's of course also true that the movie benefits from the presence of Vincent Price. This horror icon appeared in many movies like this throughout his career, also often portraying the same type of characters. Like always, he's giving away one fine performance in this movie.Some moments in the movie still feel a bit awkward. Some events within the movie simply are just plain unlikely, as are some of the characters responses. The females do nothing but screaming all of the time...not really a movie feminist would like to see.An enjoyable, well written, original horror-flick from the '50's, starring the great Vincent Price.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

This makes a pleasant entertaining cocktail ,with disturbing servants -which predate the highly superior "the haunting" (1963),as do the last lines of the movie-,a walking skeleton and a wandering head.Vincent Price is definitely the stand-out.</fullReview>

Outside the ride is con-man, huckster, schlock-Meister director William "the poor man's Alfred Hitchcock" Castle luring you inside with another one of his gimmicks. For this movie it was EMERGO billed as "The First Film With the Amazing New Wonder EMERGO: The Thrills Fly Right Into The Audience!" This movie features every corny spook house cliché: blood dripping from the ceiling, flying skeletons, ghostly apparitions and severed heads.WARNING! This movie is dumb as a post; but if you're in a campy mood it can be fun. Castle's direction must have consisted of the words "Play it as over the top as you can!" Vincent Price cannot play it more over the top, as does Elisha Cook Jr. the great character actor (Wilmer in The Maltese Falcon).The EMERGO gimmick explained. William Castle was a better con-man than director (he's a terrible director) and the posters for the movie advertised: First Film With the Amazing New Wonder EMERGO: The Thrills Fly Right Into The Audience! I saw this film in Chicago when I was 10 years old. The theater had a wire running across at balcony level and during the scene in the film where the skeleton appears a plastic skeleton emerged from a box and moved along the wire across the theater. This made all the kids in the theater scream; not from fright but because it was so silly.Pop some corn, think up some good wisecracks, and watch this with your buddies if you have absolutely nothing else to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'House on Haunted Hill' is one of those films that one remembers from his childhood and that should never be watched again. The film has indeed a great premise ?a bunch of strangers invited by a eccentric millionaire to win 10000 dollars to spend a night in the house- and most importantly, it has Vincent Price playing the millionaire. Right from the beginning the film `promises' too much, create too many expectations that are rarely fulfilled, even if regarding it with the campiest mood. The first apparition of the blind caretaker is sublime, and this leads to the first of way too many annoying screams of the leading lady. From there on, the picture goes only downwards and at a certain point we don't really care about what's going on, because the characters are dull and unsympathetic and the script gets more pointless and confusing. Time elapses without explanation, some characters disappear; loads of questions are left unanswered. It's a pity that the film had to justify things in a `believable' way, rather than exploring more obscure- if fantastic- territory. Director William Castle definitely did better in later films as The Tingler or The Night Walker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House on Haunted Hill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not seen many classic scary movies with the actor with the voice featuring in Michael Jackson's Thriller or an appearance in Edward Scissorhands, only Witchfinder General, so I was keen to see one, especially with a catchy title like this one, so when I got the opportunity I watched it with interest. Basically eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) has invited five strangers, who he personally knows in some way, to a party he is putting on for his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), he is throwing it in a secluded mansion, and he has offered each of the people $10,000 to spend one night in the house thought to be haunted. These five strangers, Lance Schroeder (Richard Long), Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal), Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig), Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook Jr.) and Ruth Bridgers (Julie Mitchum), who all arrive in funeral cars, are all told that they can leave before the stroke of midnight, but all the doors and windows have been barred and secured, so there is no means of escape once they are locked in, and if they stay and survive the entire night they will each be paid $10,000. Loren also explains about the rumours of the ghosts that haunt the mansion, and he gives each of the people a pistol to defend themselves, but Annabelle tries to convince them all that he is psychotic, they all grow suspicious of him and are naturally very nervy about the house. Nora quickly becomes terrified and fearful for her life as she sees what looks like mysterious ghouls and the doors and walls make loud noises, and she is not interested in staying in the house, even for the money, but the people are trapped when the doors have been locked before the start time. The big shock comes though when Annabelle is found dead having hanged herself above the staircase, so everyone is told to return to their rooms until the morning and keep themselves safe, Lance wants to help Nora as much as he can, but she thinks that Loren wants to kill her and the others. It turns out though that Annabelle is not dead, and has been planning with Dr. Trent to make someone kill her husband so that she can get her hands on his fortune, obviously hysterical Nora is the obvious person that could shoot her, and sure enough she does mistaking him for one of the ghosts she thinks she is seeing. Dr. Trent tries to dispose of the body of Loren in the acid pit in the basement, where a body will melt until only the bones are left, but the lights go out, and both men disappear, and when Annabelle appears she sees a skeleton emerge from the vat, but all of the sudden thought the skeleton rises and the voice of Loren is heard, she recoils in terror and accidentally backs off and falls into the acid, and the real Loren comes out of the darkness, he was controlling the skeleton which is the body of Dr. Trent. Nora thinking she killed him takes all the guests to the basement, and Loren explains the whole night was to stop his wife killing him for his money, and all the guns were loaded with blanks, but paranoid drunk house keeper Pritchard looks terrified and announces that the ghosts are coming for them. Also starring Leona Anderson as Mrs. Slydes, Howard Hoffman as Jonas and Skeleton as Himself (LOL that is genuinely a name in the cast). Price with his indelible voice and charismatic personality gives a zesty performance as the man trying to scare his guests, Cook Jr. plays the paranoid drunk very well, and the other players are fine as well, the film is filled with obviously camp and old fashioned tactics to scare the audience, with decapitated heads, witches and an acid vat, but this only adds to the fun, and there are some genuinely spooky and jumpy moments to keep you satisfied, a terrific horror. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this oft-referenced pseudo-horror classic, Vincent Price lures five strangers to stay overnight at a notorious abandoned mansion, promising ten grand to those who make it through to the next morning. Price is perfectly in his element as the shifty, flamboyant playboy who's somehow able to deliver his lines with a straight face, especially when he breaks out a charming, housewifey set of party favors: a cute set of tiny coffins containing loaded pistols. His ultimate reasoning for gathering this spooky little house party doesn't make very much sense, though, and the gotcha scenes are worse than I'd expect to find in a run-down amusement park's old haunted house. About as hammy and silly as it gets, it's tough to imagine anyone ever getting spooked out by this wacky form of the genre, but that doesn't mean it can't be entertaining for the wrong reasons. Even in the late fifties, I have to imagine it was better suited to laughs than it ever was to screams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Fun from Castle and Price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill (1959) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Classic horror film with the perfect mixture of thrills and laughs. Millionaire Vincent Price invites five people to a haunted house where they must stay the night in order to get $10,000 each. Soon various strange things start to happen and soon it appears no one will leave with their lives. For my money this here is one of the best horror films of the decade and it's without question one of the most fun. The story itself is pretty simple but Castle and Price go all out and really deliver a memorable movie that has several nice thrills and a great atmosphere that can't be matched by too many films from this era. I think the screenplay offers all five guests plenty of growth and we really start to care for all of them. Price and his wife (Carol Ohmart) have their characters perfectly built up as well during a wonderful sequence where we see and hear how much the two hate one another. The two actors are so chilling with their wicked smiles that you can't help but smile as well. Price delivers one of his greatest performances because you can never tell what you should be feeling towards him. During one scene you'll have sympathy for him but then you'll hate the guy thinking he's got a lot of secrets he's not telling. The supporting cast is very good as well with Richard Long, Alan Marshal, Elisha Cook, Julie Mitchum and Carolyn Craig turning in fine work. Castle uses this marvelous house to the perfect effect as there's enough atmosphere here for two films. The second time we see the first "ghost" always gets a good jump out of those seeing the film for the first time and the end, while not believable, still works quite well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1959, the eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) and his fifth wife Annabelle Loren (Carol Ohmart) invite five different persons to a party in a house considered haunted by evil spirits. They are locked in the house at midnight by the house keepers, and who stays alive in the next morning will share US$ 50,000.00. Along the scary night, dark secrets are revealed, in a story with a very surprising end. This classic horror movie is excellent. Although being a low budget movie with only 75 min. running time, the story is great and the sound effects and the black and white photography contribute for the fearful atmosphere. I do not recall how many times this storyline has been copied. In Brazil, there is a new distributor (London Films) specialized in horror movies. I bought many titles on DVDs, which have never been previously released, and now I am going to have the chance to watch films like `The Wicker Man', `Black Sabbath - The Three Faces of Fear', `Possession', `Black Sunday (The Mask of Satan)' and others. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil: `A Casa dos Maus Espíritos' (`The House of Bad Spirits')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of Price's better horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is about a strange rich guy (Price) who pays five seemingly random people to come to a party in a haunted house where seven people were supposedly murdered. Each is told if they stay the night, they will receive $10,000 in the morning. However, soon after this, murders begin occurring and everyone is terrified for their lives. The film does have a somewhat interesting twist at the end, though otherwise it's a haunted house film. It does try very hard and William Castle threw practically everything into this film to make it entertaining--except a decent script. Sure, it's fun to watch, but also pretty brainless--with lots of dumb plot devices and holes. For example, the home that all the people are in has a vat of acid in the basement under a trap door! Huh?! And, later, someone trips into it! Pretty clumsy, huh?! As far as the acting goes, it's not especially inspiring. Price is amazingly restrained in his performance--and I really wished he'd acted with a little more energy. Most of the rest of the actors were okay, though Elisha Cook should have been a tad embarrassed for his over-acting--he really was quite silly.Overall, the film is mediocre and very skip-able unless you are a huge Price fan.</fullReview>
