		<shortDescription>Despite a weak ending this is a surprisingly creepy Hollywood horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rich but eccentric millionaire Steven Price is looking for the ultimate scares. He invites a group of people to spend the night in the former Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane ? where the inmates revolved in a orgy of violence against the cruel regime of Dr Vannacutt. The one who does spend the night will get $1million dollars. However it soon becomes evident that not all the scares are set up by Price himself.This remake of the old 1958 movie sees the plot expanded and made a lot more creepy and enjoyable. In fact the end point of the original is only the halfway mark of this one. The plot may not be imaginative but the delivery is very good for this type of film. I'm not a big fan of horror or this type of Hollywood slasher movie as I find them too obvious and not scary. However here the gore is well used and the general creepy mood wins the film. The movement of the deceased Dr Vannacutt is very creepy and is much better than some of the gore.Sadly the final 20 minutes feels it needs to reveal a bigger evil and the secrets of the house are brought to life in boom of CGI beasties. At this point it reverts to form and because just another Hollywood creature feature and it is a bit of a let down. However up to this point it works very well and it's real creepy.The cast are all pretty good and do `camp' when necessary but don't take away from the terror that's coming later. Rush plays nicely to the camp in his homage to Price's role in the original. Jensen, Diggs, Gallagher and Kattan all do well and the cast do better than the scream queens that usual inhabit these films.Overall the film starts like any other Hollywood horror but the clever direction, creepy music and imaginative visuals of Dr Vannacutt all create a creepy feel to the film that is better than the gore that also comes. The final section slides back into standard fare with the old CGI evil coming to get us ? but up till then it's surprisingly good stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrifying movie, with no ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For once, a movie even scarier and more horrifying than the trailers for it. BUT......The whole was not equal to the sum of its parts. Geoffrey Rush (what's HE doing in this movie?!) as Steven Price is actually a very interesting character, which can be attributed to either the effort the script takes to set him up, and/or the brilliance of the Oscar-winning actor in the role. Price's wife, Evelyn, gets similar treatment, but it is here the screenwriter(s?) get lazy.The strangers in the house DO get a minimal amount of character set-up, i.e. who they are, what they do... but this information is never touched on again. One would HOPE that all ths information is being displayed for some higher purpose-- the background of these five strangers, the cat-and-mouse game played by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Price, and Mr. Price's fascination with fear that is set up so intensely in the movie's opening minutes.But alas, none of this GOES anywhere. It is all completely independent from the agenda of the House when I felt like it should all tie together, somehow. There are three forces at work here-- the ghosts who haunt the house, the humans who are trapped in it, and the Darkness that lives beneath it. These are all separate entities, we find, but for what purpose? This movie could have gone on another ten minutes, some loose ends could have been tied up, and I could have given it a much higher score.Instead, what was truly an INTENSE build-up, sputters out at the very end of the movie. It didn't even feel like an end, it just felt like the movie stopped, and we're left without an explanation to what happens to the survivors-- including the most interesting character in the movie, the House itself.7 out of 10. Fun to watch, truly terrifying, but incomplete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all for a remake (and maybe better than the original)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen some of the comments on the film here, and would beg to differ with many. I found the film to be entertaining (wouldn't William Castle have wanted that?) and that it actually paid homage to the original in so many ways (how many remakes ever do that? Generally they add a flavor-of-the-month star, a bunch of irrelevant plot changes and a soundtrack from a has-been band or one that should never have been). As a bonus, a supernatural element was brought to this film that wasn't there in the original version. I've seen a lot of complaining about the ending, but hey, life sometimes sucks and I could certainly see something like that happening to me. To tell the truth, I'd have to say that this remake was better than the first version. And this is from a stone-cold believer that Karloff was the best Frankenstein monster and Lugosi the best Dracula. Tongue in cheek this movie is -- James Whale would have loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Asylums. Crazy people. Insanity. Mental therapy, mental hospitals, mental patients have been used time and time again in horror fiction and horror films. Why? I'm not sure; maybe, it is the normality of being like those that are insane which brings a more genuine horror to us. Whatever it is, House on Haunted Hill certainly uses all the mental derangement cliches to full effect. I could easily pan this film by saying(and rightly so) that its predecessor, the original House on Haunted Hill directed by William Castle, is a far superior film. That Castle's film was filled with better acting, better timing, and easily a better script. But I liked this film, which is not really a remake entirely. It has many elements that are not in the first film; most of them centering around the mental aspect aforementioned. The house in this film was once an asylum where people...thousands perhaps..were brutally butchered in the name of mental good health. The house is scary. Empty corridors, large, vast rooms, incredible special effects all add to the frightening aspects of the film. The biggest problem with the film is that much of it just doesn't add up in terms of making sense of the plot. The film fortunately is more special effects driven than plot driven, and at least is able to deliver the goods in that arena. The acting is pretty good with all the leads really doing quite a good job. Geoffrey Rush gives his best Vincent Price impression(pencil-thin mustache and all) delivering lines with bravura gusto. The other exceptional standout is Chris Kattan as Watson Pritchard. Kattan is just wonderful in the role showcasing his obvious talent. As far as great horror films go...this film is adequate, yet very thrilling, exciting, and entertaining. If you are like me and love the old one...just look at this film as a totally different entity. It is. One thing is for sure...it is one heck of a rollercoaster ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT A BAD REMAKE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a bad remake. It is "R" rated, so parents beware, this is NOT the Price classic of 1958. Within the first scene there is gore (surgery on a wide awake man), violence (the inmates of the asylum break loose and attack the staff), and nudity (uniforms ripped open on the women). This is crucial to the plot (Hill House is not the same murder house from the original, it's a former asylum for the criminally insane where torture and experimentations are done on the inmates). A fire breaks out and all but five die.Jump to present day. Multimillionaire Steven Price (is the name a nod to Vincent?) played by Geoffrey Rush, doing his best sideshow barker impersonation/Williams Castle impersonation, and wife (Famke Janssen) are having a party, in the restored former asylum. The guest's trip to the house is still via several hearse and from this point much of the original plot is maintained.The part that bothered me about the arrival scene at the house, was the inappropriate song. It set the wrong mood, and I worried about what was going to be next. Thankfully, the rest of the score (except the end title) was strictly orchestral, and sent a nice dark mood to try to help to scare you. Applause to Don Davis.House does rely rather heavily on special effects as do all the current re-makes. Is it really better or worse for it? I think it adds, and they didn't just redo the same show. It's spooky and a good Halloween movie, and a dark theater is excellent for it's effect. I am sorry, but there was nothing that I found really scary or horrifying. Of course, I haven't really been scared by a movie since I saw the Wolf Man (1941), with Lon Chaney jr, in 1958. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting the worst--a remake of a lousy 1950s Vincent Price flick (I HATE the original--talk about boring!) and there were no previews--never a good sign. I was surprised to find an intelligent, scary movie. There was gore and violence, but they didn't overdo it (except for the part when someone was given shock treatment--talk about harrowing!). The script was intelligent--all the characters talk and, sometimes, act like real people. And, thankfully, no stupid in-jokes or character to provide "comic" relief. Everything is dealt with seriously which just adds to the tension. The setting is scary--the "house" (actually an abandoned asylum) LOOKS evil, and inside it's all darkness and cobwebs. The acting...well...Rush is having a GREAT time in his role, and it rubbed off on me. Every time he was on screen I enjoyed it. The rest of the cast is OK, but anyone could have played these roles...they were just mostly reacting to special effects. The only real disappointment here was Taye Diggs. He showed that he had charisma, could act and has a GREAT body in previous flicks ("How Stella Got Her Groove Back"; "GO"; "The Wood"). So why does he give such a so-so performance here--he's even worse in "The Best Man". Hopefully he'll start acting again...soon. I also heard about lousy CGI effects in this movie. When the CGI effects go barreling out of control at the end though, I was scared! I'm a veteran of hundreds (literally) of horror films so I don't scare easy. The only weak part was a real stupid "surprise" at the end that comes out of nowhere. Other than that it worked.So, this is a good, scary horror film. Worth shelling out full price at a cinema--DON'T wait for the video. This works great in a dark theatre with excellent stereo sound--it won't work on a TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've just won a million dollars! You just have to make it through House on Haunted Hill without having nightmares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill, my first rated R movie I saw in the theater, huge deal since I was only 13 at the time. But anyways, House on Haunted Hill is of course remake of the same title, back in the day the original star of the movie was Vincent Price, it was spooky and creepy, the only problem? The original has some what lost it's effect it had on people, don't get me wrong, it's still an excellent film, but compared to a lot of horror films of today, it seems rather tame. So of course, you know what that means? Let's remake the story and add tons of computer CGI and gore! But was this remake really that bad? Actually I'd say that I did enjoy it, it had good suspense and very grizzly images that will stay in your head. It's a pretty decent update of this chilling ghost story and never lets go.The film is set in an abandoned asylum, where numerous murders were committed in the past. The head of the facility, Dr. Richard B. Vannacutt, performed grotesque experiments and medical procedures on the patients, killing many in the process. The hospital was closed when some of the patients escaped, killing almost the entire staff and burning the hospital. We then meet Evelyn, a spoiled trophy wife, and Steven Price, an amusement park mogul with a wicked sense of humor, each of whom would gladly kill the other. Evelyn fancies spectacular parties, so Steven leases the house from the owner, Watson Pritchett, for his Halloween birthday bash. Evelyn gives Steven a guest list two pages long; he shreds it to spite her and then creates one of his own. The five people who show up for the party: Jennifer Jenzer, Eddie Baker, Melissa Margaret Marr, Dr. Donald Blackburn and Pritchett himself ? aren't the ones he invited. Neither Evelyn nor Steven know who they are. Despite this, Price continues the party's theme, offering a million dollars to anyone who stays in the house and survives until morning. Of course this isn't any easy task as the ghosts are about and ready for a bloody good time.While I would recommend for nostalgic reasons to stick to the original as it is a true classic, I say that this remake is still worth the look. It's definitely worth it in the dark, I can't tell how much this one scene frightened me beyond compare? when the reporter is filming in the basement to get an idea of what the asylum was like and the ghosts only appear on camera, she sees them torturing a patient and they look up at her and goosebumps are the least of your worries at this point. All in all, this is a very decent remake compared to other sad remakes we had that year like The Haunting. But still I wonder what Vincent Price would say if he was able to see how they updated the story? maybe even do his little "rap" Thriller style! You know I had to get that in.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSSix strangers are invited to a 'haunted house' party at a former asylum - the scene of a massacre many years earlier, when inmates rebelled against the psychotic chief surgeon (Jeffrey Combs) - and the guests are assailed by restless spirits with a murderous agenda...This remake of William Castle's 1959 shocker was the first title in a projected series by Dark Castle Entertainment, a genre outfit established by the creative personnel behind HBO's "Tales from the Crypt" (Robert Zemeckis, Joel Silver and Gilbert Adler) as a platform for the 'revision' of Castle's entire oeuvre. Working from Robb White's original story, screenwriter Dick Beebe and director William Malone - previously responsible for such unassuming B-movies as SCARED TO DEATH (1980) and CREATURE (1985) - remain faithful to Castle's original whilst goosing the material with newfangled effects technology and levels of gore which Castle had been denied during his lifetime. Production designer David F. Klassen has also updated the eponymous house, a clifftop monstrosity whose plunging Art deco exterior masks the Gothic ruin within, haunted by monstrous spirits who 'come alive' and terrorize a cast of defiantly modern characters, including Geoffrey Rush as a cynical fairground entrepeneur (clearly modelled after Vincent Price), and Famke Janssen as his beautiful, bitchy, duplicitous wife.The film's uneven tone (veering between horror and humor and back again) is likely to divide viewers from the outset, but the horror scenes are played with remarkable gravity, and attentive viewers will spot visual references to the likes of GHOST STORY (1981) and JACOB'S LADDER (1990), particularly a 'guest appearance' by one of the most hair-raising phantoms from that former title. Some of the original film's charm has been lost along the way, replaced by profanity and splatter (though not as much as some outraged critics would have you believe), and there's nothing in the remake which compares to the blood-freezing shock induced by Carol Ohmart's encounter with a blind, white-haired ghost in Castle's version, but Malone's update deserves a mark for trying. Also starring Bridgette Wilson, Peter Gallagher, Ali Larter and the ultra-beautiful Taye Diggs, alongside comedian Chris Kattan, here playing it impressively straight in a role originally essayed by Elisha Cook Jr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Butcher us, mad doctor Combs!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The similarities between William Castle's campy 1959 original and this typical Hollywood remake are kept to a minimum. We have the premise of 5 people who're offered a million $ if they survive spending a night in 'the house' and Rush who brings tribute to Vincent Price (who played the lead role in the original). Other than this, Malone just follows the routine remake-standards meaning bigger, louder and more spectacular. If you're not too harsh, this actually is a pretty enjoyable movie and ? at times ? a successful mixture between an old-fashioned 'haunted house' chiller and a modern special effects playground. Thanks to some sort of miracle, Malone managed to cast class actor Geoffrey Rush and a more than decent supportive cast. Rush is talented enough to make his performance of eccentric impresario Steven Price look like a homage to Vincent Price instead of doing a lame impersonation. To me, however, the absolute star of this film is Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator) who plays the small role of the demented Dr. Vannacutt. As usual, Combs' character is the cause of all horror and his grimaces are more diabolical then ever. He's an amazing horror icon and I simply can't get why he isn't enjoying an immortal success-status. Until about 5 minutes before the ending, the use of CGI is imaginative and not irritating at all. The finale is overly fake and kinda ruins the film. If you're not too demanding, The House on Haunted Hill guarantees a lot of fun and a few scares. Definitely a better remake than Jan De Bont's The Haunting and Steve Beck's 13 Ghosts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (1999) ***Starring: Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen, Taye Diggs, Chris Kattan, Peter Gallagher, and Bridgette Wilson Director: William Malone Running Time: 96 minutes Rated R (for strong terror violence and gore, language and brief nudity)By Blake French:It's been such a long time since I have been truly terrified by a movie that is supposed to be scary. To my pleasant surprise, however, "The House on Haunted Hill," did scare me out of my wits at times. Curiously, I find myself disliking the film because of the flawed characters and structure, yet recommending it due to the enticing and thrilling material contained within the tension-filled story line.The first thing I would like to do in reviewing "The House on Haunted Hill," is compare and contrast it with the milder horror flick released earlier this year called "The Haunting." That film surprised America with an unexpected PG-13 rating, unlike the appropriately R-rated "The House on Haunted Hill." Although "The Haunting" did work due to an intriguing story line, it missed the fact that in order to please an audience attending a scream-feast, it needs to do some experimenting with its atmosphere, characters, and antagonism so we know what we're up against. That film had little to no violent, gory, or shocking material, only contained marginally passable psychological terror. That is the main reason why that very film, directed by Jon De Bont, didn't manage to become a memorable summer movie experience.Unlike "The Haunting," "The House on Haunted Hill," is not afraid to graphically pick off its characters one by one in a grizzly manor to provoke horrifying fright in an audience. It is great fun to predict who is going to be next to go and how they'll be murdered. Personally, I've been longing for this kind of material for quite some time now.This film does, however, have a lot in common with "The Haunting." For example, both movies are shot in somewhat of an old-fashioned style--an effective characteristic. Both offer quite a bit of scary material. But "The House on Haunted Hill" seems to be more of an ambitious, if flawed, thriller. The story centers on a clan of five strangers who each are offered one million dollars if they spend the night in a closed-down Psychiatric Institute that was massacred by its own patients after a rebellion in the 1930's. In charge of this whole arrangement, a twisted and rich theme park owner, Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush), and his wife, Evelyn (Famke Janssen), who have been experiencing marital problems for some time now. They're throwing together this party for Price's birthday, but when an elaborate and efficient security system traps them in, weird events begin to occur. Things that may or may not be part of an intricate plan to induce money, murder, and survival.What, or who, is responsible the unusual assurances at the institute? How did the guest list of the party mysteriously alter itself? What is happening to everyone if this entire situation is a prank? Are these characters that stupid? What exactly is the instate haunted by? Why did the patients rebel in the 30's, and not sooner? Their motives are clear, but why wait so long to do something about the hell accruing because of their doctors? "The House on Haunted Hill" is not the movie to answer these questions. Neither is it the film educated enough to properly develop an explanation of the characters to us. Stephen Price is developed well in one of the film's first scenes. But for the rest of the characters, each of them saying their name and what they do for a living doesn't quite cut it here. Because of this, the movie's many plot and character twists aren't as effective as they should be, because we don't know the characters to begin with. So if the movie tries to tell us that someone is not who they appear to be, how are we supposed to believe it--we never really knew who they were from the beginning?Also to this film's dismay, the direction is all over the wall here. William Malone does a good job of focusing on each of the scary elements, but not on the characters. When they walk slowly down a dark deserted hallway, they seem to get off focus of where they really are and the circumstances they are in. Also nearly crucifying the production: there aren't any boundaries here. Seemingly anything and everything can happen. At least "The Haunting" had some guidelines of where reality is taken into account.The Psychiatric Institute is a perfect, terrifying atmosphere for this movie to be placed in. The fact that the strange and seemingly dangerous occurrences could be part of Price's trickery, or something else on that matter, just strengthens the drama more and increase the line of raising tension. The filmmakers take advantage of most of the opportunities they receive to use the house's many dark hallways and creepy chambers. In particular, there is a especially disturbing sequence in a chamber, which is supposed to make an insane man sane, or a sane man insane, that produces such a horrifying perspective of a character's mind, it is almost safe to say the filmmakers went too far over the edge here.I also find to my liking the film's performances, which are creative and full of energy. Geoffrey Rush is a great stuck up fraud, and he is able to accomplish much with his character due to his wonderfully fresh development, unlike the other characters. Famke Janssen ("Deep Rising," 1998) I also am surprised to enjoy, in a sly, conniving role. Taye Diggs can't really do much in this type of movie, he is more fit in films like "The Best Man," or "How Stella Got Her Groove Back," but what he does seems underplayed. Who really stands out here is the always appealing Peter Gallagher, who brings a hidden regularity to his character. But regardless of his character, he doesn't scene-steal, nor does he overact."The House on Haunted Hill" may be a very flawed film, but at lest it serves its purpose: to provoke fear in an audience. It is a very close call for me, recommending the film or not, and a medium review is given. Someday I might regret my decision to warrant "The House on Haunted Hill" with a minor recommendation. But as of this day and age, I feel obligated to.Brought to you by Warner Bros.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Ghost Train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of William Castle's cult horror from 1958 is a reasonably good update, deliberately designed as something of a Ghost Train ride. It's fun and has creepy 20s flashbacks galore, throws in plenty of blood and adds a plot twist or two to the original story.The plot concerns Geoffrey Rush's amusement park entrepreneur inviting a small number of guests he's never previously met to his wife's birthday party, intending to host it in a disused asylum that was the scene of a terrible tragedy. However the couple hate each other with a passion and each may be planning to murder the other before the night is over. To add to the fun, the guests who turn up were not the ones he invited, though he has offered each a million dollars if they survive the night. It appears they are the descendants of those who died the first time around, and now the house won't let them out...Rush's character, Steven Price, is surely a homage to good ol' Vincent of that ilk, and super-hero fans can enjoy the sight of Famke Janssen from X-Men and Ali Larter from Heroes amongst the cast. The flashback sequences are excellent, and appear to have had an influence on games like Bioshock; and the old, creepy crypts of the house are genuinely unsettling. House On Haunted Hill has excellent production design, and it's always great to see Jeffry Combes show up as the sinister Doctor. There are flaws, however. The characters are not particularly well-developed, so we don't care what happens to most of them much, and the story is very diffuse, not focusing on anything in detail before moving on to the next set piece. But House isn't bad as horror remakes go - in fact it matches the original, and is bound to keep the gore hounds happy. Recommended as good roller coaster ride.</fullReview>

When the hapless woman played by Bridgette Wilson goes out for a walk looking around the house through the camrecorder and sees the torturous Dr Vannacutt and the twisted nurses vivisecting the patient, it's sure an awesome moment when the evildoers turn to look at her. Hitchcock never reached such a level of horror.It's descriptive of the movie that this scene is immediately exploited and wasted.

		<fullReview>Eccentric millionaire Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush) throws a birthday party for his wife (Famke Janssen) at a haunted house that used to be an insane asylum before the inmates revolted and killed everyone inside. A group of strangers invited to the party are offered $1,000,000 each if they can survive the night in the house. As strange things start happening, the guests question whether Price is behind it all or if there really is some evil force at work in the house on haunted hill.Being a big fan of the original House on Haunted Hill, a classic B movie from William Castle, I had low hopes for this remake at the time it was released. I figured going into it that it would have the worst excesses of modern horror films (more violence, gore, nudity, F bombs every other word, clichéd jump scares, etc.). And while it certainly does have some of those things (although not to the degree I was dreading) it also has a lot of humor and a self-awareness about it that makes it fun to watch. The cast is pretty good with Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen the standouts. Their scenes together are the highlights of the movie. Chris Kattan is amusing but his part in the climax is the stuff of unintended comedy legend. Also love the nods to Vincent Price with Rush's character. The CGI effects aren't the best but that's a minor complaint in a movie like this. It's not scary in the least but it is entertaining, something it has in common with the original. Not bad for a remake of a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay - but not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, my first impressions of a movie holds true upon repeat viewings. Unless the story is particularly deep or the plot difficult to follow, subsequent viewings generally do not change my initial reaction to a movie to any great degree. So, as I sat to watch The House on Haunted Hill, I wasn't expecting much. The film is not without some major faults, but overall, I enjoyed my second experience. Scenes such as the operating room flashback or touches like the hall of embalmed bodies are the stuff of nightmares as far as I'm concerned.The house itself is another major bonus to the movie. The interior is presented, lit, and shot in a manner that creates almost immediate atmosphere. The seemingly endless corridors, the surgical/medical rooms with their devices of "torture", and the blood present almost everywhere added to my feeling that the house is the real star of the movie.But, as I said, the movie does have its faults. I'll just mention two: First - paper thin characters. It's really difficult to care about many of the character in this movie because we know nothing about most of them. Other than Geoffrey Rush's character, the others are there merely for the slaughter. They aren't real.Second - the ending. This appears to be everyone's major complaint, and with good reason. All of the atmosphere and creepiness the movie had built is destroyed the moment the CGI "darkness" makes an appearance. It is so out of place with everything that had gone on before. It's to bad that the writers couldn't come up with a good ending - I would have much preferred an ending involving the doctor or former patients. The movie had been heading in that direction all along.When I initially saw this in the theater, I would have rated it a 4/10. My opinion has now, however, changed. I may never consider it a masterpiece, but there are some moments that are very effective and make it worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Film, Nice Actresses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I can begin to review the "remake" of House on Haunted Hill, we must first throw the plot, effects, and script out the window, because the movie does a pretty good job of that by itself. The only reason (and there really isn't ANY) that you should see this film is for the performances by three lovely and talented actresses: Ali Larter, Famke Janssen, and especially Bridgette Wilson. They make the film worthwhile, or at least the scenes that they're in. [SPOILER ALERT!!] The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because one of my favorite actresses, Bridgette Wilson, was in it and I was excited about seeing her camping it up in a horror movie like she did a few years ago in I Know What You Did Last Summer. And sure enough, there she is, with video camera in hand as pseudo-celebrity Melissa Margaret Marr, the best dressed and biggest ego of the group. Just when I think the movie might not be so bad with her in it, what happens? She dies! That's right. Within the first forty-five minutes, Bridgette Wilson is already gone and there's nothing left but Famke Janssen, who does all she can as Geoffrey Rush's psychotic wife before she herself too, dies, and Ali Larter, who deserves so much better than this movie and can be seen in a much better movie right now, Final Destination. As for the scares, puh-leese. The only frightening thing is that people still pay to see movies like this. The cheesy original was scarier, anyway, and had more fun with its cast. Nothing is truly scary at all, although it is a little gruesome at times. So while I wait for Bridgette Wilson to do another horror film, I'll have to say that HOHH is one of the worst movies I have EVER seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy update of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gathered together for a birthday party, the guests and hosts of a lavish celebration in a haunted asylum find the events part of the house' intent to kill them off and must find a way to get out alive.This one was quite an enjoyable and vastly improved remake. This gets a lot right with the atmosphere and setting on display, which is pretty chilling throughout the film here as this comes from how well this one utilizes the house it its advantage. The long, endless darkened hallways, cramped treatment rooms and overall atmosphere of the disuse throughout with cobwebs and disrepair found here make for some really creepy elements along the way which set up the ghost action nicely. This one gets the better of creepy events happening in a creepy location, as early scenes of them following the ghostly doppelganger all throughout the different rooms, a fantastic encounter in the operating room where they're only visible on a video camera and the later scene of the group encountering the hidden experiment rooms where the ghosts' manage to trap them in their patient treatments which result in some bloody kills and tense scenes. Likewise, the finale also manages to interject quite a bit of fun here by showcasing the thrilling chases around the basement, the formation of the mass of spectral blob that holds the ghosts of the dead as well as the fun of the big chase around the house as the relentless race to get up the house before it swallows the remaining survivors is a fun, incredibly action-packed finale here. Along with the great gore and creepy back-story, these here are enough for this one to hold off the few flaws here. The biggest issue here is the fact that this one really overdoes the bickering couple angle to the point of overkill, not only making it questionable about why they're together but the fact that they continue to feel that way deep into the film it grows tiresome, as well as prevents this from really buying into what's going on. It would've been a lot more credible had they stopped going at each other and bought into the truth. Finally, this one really strains credibility with how it gets the group to the house which makes no sense at all about how a supernatural entity would be able to conduct business in that manner when it's overt display of powers in doing that mean it could've just killed them off without ever needing them o come into the house in the first place. However, these are mostly minor points that don't hold this one down all that much.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absurd but sometimes fun remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The House on Haunted Hill" is a goofy, extremely cheesy horror movie that is small on real horror and big on the kind of scares caused by things jumping out from the side of the camera. That made it less scary for me than it might for some people; while I found "The Blair Witch Project" surprisingly frightening because of it's realism, this movie got more laughs and knowing smirks from me than fear. That's not always a bad thing. There is warm spot in my heart for movies like these, which know how shallow and silly they are and aren't afraid to show it. The movie's setup is pretty simple. Geoffrey Rush plays a wealthy amusement park developer who is willing to stoop to any cheap trick for a scare (named Price in a tip-of-the-hat to the late, great Vincent Price, who starred in the 1954 original). I liked the sardonic tone with which Rush plays his character (when asked if a phone call was business or pleasure, he snaps "Neither, it was my wife.") He has a love/hate relationship with his wife, who wants to throw a birthday party for herself in an old asylum that's built into a towering cliff overlooking the ocean. I've never seen an institution built like this, but never mind; it provides a opportunity to show the visitors winding their way up a needlessly twisty driveway as lightning crashes overhead. We know from the opening shots that the institution was the scene of an inferno that claimed the lives of 55 people, including the inmates and a mad doctor that performed gory experiments on his patients. Now the asylum has been converted into a house by its new owners, both of whom died under mysterious circumstances. Price's wife wants to throw her party here for its spooky atmosphere. But her guest list is switched at the last minute, and the four guests that turn up are strangers to her. It should not come as a surprise that none of the guests were selected by accident. They are joined by the son of the deceased owner, a flighty sort of guy who jumps at every creak the house makes. Price has thrown in a twist as well: each of them will receive one million dollars, cash, if they stay the whole night in the house. This is all just an excuse to get the seven characters locked in the house for the night so they can be picked off one by one. It didn't matter much to me who lived or who died, since they are all more or less interchangeable. I enjoyed the banter between the Prices, and the resignation of the new owner to his impending death. He informs the others ominously that the house is alive, and that it wants to kill them all. I chuckled then, wondering why, if that was the case, he had held onto it for so long. But then he wouldn't have been there to come up with the brilliant plan to go into the basement and turn off the controls for the lockdown mechanism. The characters behave exactly as horror movie characters always do, which is to say, in the stupidest way imaginable. Although it is suggested repeatedly that they should stick together, we know that they'll wander off into that basement more than once and far more than necessary, so that ghostly figures can lead them astray and ghastly creatures can tear them limb from limb. They follow the horror movie textbook, falling apart in a crisis and getting into petty disputes, and then scheming against each other. The movie updates the special effects of the original, of course; today's audiences are not likely to be easily impressed by creepy skeletons and things that go bump in the night. The special effects are clearly computer generated, but not very impressive. There is one scene in which the floor seems to explode upward for no apparent reason, except to give the characters something to run away from. The gore level is pretty high, but not terribly realistic. In the end what carries the movie is its goofy charm. It contains all the elements of a Vincent Price horrorfest, and that is pretty much what it strives to be. On that level, I could appreciate it. Its not very long (96 minutes) but could have been trimmed even more and seemed less tiresome in parts. Watching it was like eating popcorn: no nutritional value whatsoever, kind of light and airy, with a taste that fades within minutes after consuming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off let's get this out of the way,, of course folks the Original with Vincent Price was better.. that being said,, I like how this one doesn't entirely follow the original,, case in point,, in this "new" one the house used to be an old Asylum where hundreds , perhaps thousands were mistreated to cruel and unusual punishment, most of the film does follow the original,, same premise,, millionaire invites 10 people to spend the night and if they survive the money is theirs. what I liked about this film , is all of the special fx. all of the blood and gore that we wanted in the first one and couldn't get because it was just the dawn of color, and the technology obviously wasn't there yet,, all in all I think this one was pretty good,, so I apologize to Vincent Price,,, but still the ORIGINAL was better as far as plot and acting wise goes,,,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the ending -- Hi-Tech Reimagining of a Classic, Huge Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of this reviewers need to take a chill pill. There is a huge difference between a remake (which statistically Hollywood tends to mess up more often than it succeeds) and a re-imagining, where the Rulebook is thrown out the window and, basically, its No Holds Barred. This is a re-imagining and as such it is really a lot of fun. It is one thing to make the jump from B&amp;W to colour. It is an entirely different order of magnitude to pump up your re-do with hi tech special effects, magic glasses that enable the characters to see what should not be seen, and at the finale, some sort of giant clockwork that you would otherwise expect to find in Dr. Who. This film was released at Halloween, which means in effect that the studio was looking for a fast buck and not trying to produce THE MATRIX. I think they exceeded their own expectations. A great cast, recognizable names, and the wandering through the basement is very creepy and good scary fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The big budget, slick Hollywood remake of William Castles' fondly remembered 1959 spook show may be able to boast all the special effects that money can buy, but it lacks the playful tone of Castle. Its characters, by and large, are not worth really caring about. It's grim, oppressive, and does live up to the word "horror". It's made in the modern style with a hip, attractive cast and an accent on gore and sadism. Fortunately, one good thing is that if there's one thing that director William Malone ("Parasomnia", "FeardotCom") is good at, it's creating a visual style. The movie *does* look great.Five people are invited to the birthday bash for Evelyn Stockard-Price (Famke Janssen), which conveniently is located in your standard issue cliffside mansion that naturally used to be an insane asylum. They're provided with loaded guns as party favours, and informed that if they can survive the night, they stand to become $1 million richer. Soon horrible things begin to happen to them.This does get a reasonable boost from talented Geoffrey Rush's delicious Vincent Price imitation, and the delightful bitchiness delivered by Janssen. In addition to the lovely Ms. Janssen, other ladies providing eye candy include Ali Larter and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras. Taye Diggs is good as a hero type, but Chris Kattan is a little too much as whiny building owner Watson Pritchett. It's nice as it always is to see Jeffrey Combs, as he plays demented surgeon Dr. Vannacutt. Singer Lisa Loeb is a reporter. And recognize that nurse? It's Gozer from "Ghost Busters", a.k.a. model / actress Slavitza Jovan.Eventually, the movie does go overboard in the special effects department, giving us a generous dose of digitally created and very unscary ghosts. The ending is somewhat amusing if not that satisfying.Six out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House on Haunted Hill (1999)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The House on Haunted Hill remake is a pretty good re-imagining of the original 1959 classic. It has the same premise of the guests having to stay in a haunted mansion for the night. If they survive the night, they get a large cash sum. Instead of the $10,000 prize in the original, the guests will each receive 1 million dollars for staying alive. There is more of a story in this remake with regards to the house and the tale behind it. Geoffrey Rush plays Stephen Price, an amusement park mogul that loves to terrify people. When his wife Evelyn wants her birthday party to be held in an old asylum, he gives in and invites a few people to the party. The evil spirits end up changing the guest list to one of it's own in an interesting twist revealed later on in the film.The house is actually the Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane which was shut down in the 30's. Dr. Vannacutt would perform grotesque procedures on the patients until eventually the patients revolted, killing many of the nurses and doctors - including Dr. Vannacutt. There are some cool imagery in the whole film with some of the "dream" sequences and the different torture techniques within the house. The characters are generally likable and the acting is perfect. Geoffrey Rush has great chemistry with Famke Janssen, his on screen wife. She has some good one liners, and Chris Kattan who played the nervous Pritchard character was amazing in the role.This is a pretty cool modern day take on the late 50's classic. It has one of the most interesting beginnings of most films I've seen, and a very cool twist and the end of it all.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good horror that unfortunately becomes silly towards the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a good horror film, with effective moments. However at the end it just gets plain silly and predictable. A man offers 1000000 dollars to anyone who survives a night in a house that used to be an asylum. When neither his nor his wife's guests appear and bodies begin to drop, everyone must work together to find out what is happening and to try and get out. The whole cast give great performances considering the mix of talent that ranges from big movie stars to TV actors. The film is great when they are haunted by the ghosts of the past inmates and by the sinister doctor. And even better when conspiracies start to unravel. At the end, however, the film ruins its nightmare inducing ghost story, with a CGI mega-spirit. The ending is a predictable and a stale waste of film. The director could have done it much better with a lower budget ending and the clever editing that made the rest of the film scary.Also a surprise ending would have worked a hell of a lot better then the Hollywood mush that it did end with. Overall though, i think that it's a great film to rent if you like the haunted house story. Just turn it off before the ending ruins it. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of this first film (and of both director William Castle and star Vincent Price), this first effort from Dark Castle Entertainment (founded by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis) comes off as a minor disappointment. However, the original story was pretty much left intact...A group of complete strangers are offered a handsome reward (a million dollars this time) to spend the night in a supposed haunted mansion. Only difference are that this time the ghosts are for real, there's violence/gore and a back story to the house (shown in flashbacks featuring an all-too-briefly-seen Jeffrey Combs as a deranged scientist).Geoffrey Rush's performance is near-perfect Vincent Price schtick (although he claims he tried to pattern it after cult director John Waters!) and the FX thankfully showcase more make-up (by the always reliable KNB) than CGI. However, it's too dark and serious to really be "enjoyable," completely fails to capture the spirit of fun that was so prevalent in the original and the ending really stinks. Still, it's much better than the same years atrocious remake of THE HAUNTING, which, of course did much better at the box office.Score: 4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good try, shame about the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got this movie from a friend of mine and to be honest I was rather expecting a comedy/horror like so many others that have gone out of their way to bore the viewer to tears. I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a genuinely creepy film. One of the things that I find lacking in most (attempts) at horror films nowadays is atmosphere, which I feel is critical to a horror film. Think of films like "Scream", "I know what you did last summer", etc. All films made to entertain the kids with a watered down and easily digested form of 'horror'. These films rely mostly on the instant shock effect (the cat jumping out of the closet) instead of building up some serious tension that will leave the viewer very disturbed instead of merely surprised.House on Haunted Hill manages to create a very convincing atmosphere through some subtle and some not so subtle visual gags The images of the ghosts certainly creeped me out and left a lingering impression on me for a long time after the film had finished. And this, I feel, is the film's greatest achievement. The story is predictable at best and the acting certainly functional with some good performances but nothing memorable. There is, of course, nothing about the story that really surprises you as it moves towards the inevitable 'happy' ending but I'm more than willing to forgive the movie for this, again because of the atmosphere.Unfortunately the end is also where I feel the writers/director dropped the ball on this one. Instead of sticking with the horrific ghosts as the proverbial bad guys they chose to make the house into an entity (some sort of weird black goo). I wouldn't have a problem with this if it wasn't for the fact that it's just not scary! They completely wrecked the wonderful vibe that they'd created with the ghosts and the apperition of the doctor. After going through a lot of effort to introduce these ghosts they drop them from the story entirely making the first hour or so seem pointless all of a sudden. I won't even go into the highly unlikely way that our heroes get out of the house but the whole CGI blob-like uber ghost just seems like an easy way to wrap the story up.I was very frustrated by this movie, I loved the first part and honestly wish they would've gone further with it but in the end they just played it safe. This movie came so close to restoring my faith in Hollywood horror (together with Below and Event Horizon) but alas, no such luck. That said, I still think most fans of horror will get a nice rush out of this film. It has some really freaky imagery that can scare you quite effectively. Just ignore the climax and you'll enjoy this film, if only for the atmosphere.</fullReview>

The same question was there for Liam Neeson in yet another terrible remake of another horror classic, "The Haunting". It is not often that I stop to comment on terrible films, but this one really rubbed me wrong, as did the Neeson remake. Both are of classics from about the same period: Vincent Price starred in the former "House on Haunted Hill" in 1958, while "The Haunting" came out in 1963. Both are considered to be almost without equal, and their remakes, both in 1999, I would qualify as nothing short of disastrous...! How is it that H-wood honestly believes that special effects with haunted buildings (not to be confused with good old fashioned, but sadly passé, Ghost Stories) can replace good honest suspense...? Somebody really needs to explain it to me as people walked out of both films either laughing or disgusted; count me among the latter. Rating ONE star (of five)-- and for kindness only! Don't go see it, don't waste money on the video, flip the channel when it comes on cable, and say no to your friends when invited to see either of these HORROR-ible insults to past classic works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake of the 1958 film of the same name, and unlike most remakes, it actually is better than the original. The new film doesn't rely as much on FX and shock as the silly recent remake of THE HAUNTING and actually has some good atmosphere including spooky sounds and an effective musical score.Rush does a great Vincent Price. In fact, his character is fittingly called Price. I haven't had so much fun at a scary movie in a long time. While this film does reflect the 90s fascination with computer FX, it nevertheless is able to keep the mood of the old horror flicks from the 50s, and thus it really does entertain.</fullReview>

This movie, take away Chris Cattan, is another schlokfest based on special effects and stupid characters. It follows a long line of horror movies that has you rooting for the house.

We ran out of money and have to rush the movie." I was hoping that it would be closer to the original more than The Haunting was. But, alas, I was dissappointed. The movie had some decent scares but most of them laughable. I sat there saying to myself and sometimes out loud, "Oh yeah you couldn't see that coming, No."I say that this movie is good for the people who want to waste time and money. Sure you'll get some scares but thats about it. They should have paid me $1,000,000 after still being in my seat at the end of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cold hearted wife (Famke Janssen) of a twisted theme park big-shot: Steven Price (Oscar-Winner:Geoffery Rush) decide to give a party at an abandoned institute for the Criminally Insane but when her husband decides to host a scary/jokey birthday bash for his wife at that house. When five strangers (Taye Diggs, Ali Larter, Chris Kattan, Peter Gallagher &amp; Bridgette Wilson) are mysteriously assembled for the event. Steven promises to give one million bucks, no question asked if they spend the night could make them very rich or profoundly dead but that abandoned institute is a murder way of life at the House on Hanuted Hill.Directed by William Malone (Creature, Feardotcom) made a well made horror film that has little resemblance of the original 1959 cult classic. The film has a few good chills and good performances from the cast especially by Ex-Saturday Night Live Comic:Kattan. Some will dislike the remake but for those, who enjoy the remake will have a good time. This Remake is Certainly a lot better than the Flawed and Very Undercooked-The Haunting (1999). The visual effects might be a bit heavy handed towards the end but it's a enjoyable jolting fun film.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an terrific:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an entertaining running commentary track by the director, behind the scenes documentaries, deleted scenes with intro by the director and more. This film won't start the party without you, Horror Fans will love this more than others. Don't miss this trashy but creepy fun remake. Jeffery Combs from the Re-Animator Trilogy/The Frighteners Fame has a bit role also. Produced by Joel Silver (The Lethal Weapon Series) and Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away). (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping that 'House on Haunted Hill' was going to be better than 'The Haunting', but this is even worse. It's supposed to be a big ride into horror, but it's not. The director tries to create some 'disturbing' images, but the timing is always wrong and the way things are shot stresses out his lack of craftsmanship. It might scare some kids, but it's not for the horror fans. The characters' background is not developed at all, so it's not even interesting to watch the movie for the sake of the story. At least 'The Haunting' had some well developed characters, which made it watchable.Well, I believe that if 'House on Haunted Hill' or even 'The Haunting' were filmed in the 80's, they would have been a lot more successful in their goal (which is to scare the audience). Maybe it's the digital age that it's not suitable for horror movies yet (was 'The Mummy' scary at all?), but maybe it's just the lack of talent of some directors.You want to see something scary and disturbing? Watch 'Hellraiser'!1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film at the cinema and was impressed by the special effects. When i actually watched the film on DVD this week i soon realised that the decent special effects featured on the trailer were in fact the only special effects in the film. Though i quite like the original, i absolutely hated this movie, and if it is true that Dark Castle productions are indeed planning to remake a whole host of William Castle movies then i hope they do a better job! The script was perhaps the worst i have witnessed in a long time, the characters were all so instantly annoying that i found my self wishing them dead with in the first fifteen minutes. It actually took me two sittings to watch the movie, it was either that or i would have found myself fast forwarding through it. The plot, what there is of it, doesn't make much sense and the film doesn't explain why certain things are happening, Price's wifes relationship with one of the guests for example. This movie was so bad i ended up feeling frustrated and cheated, it actually made me so angry. Avoid this like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong effects in a clichéd and unoriginal remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hollywood remake machine goes into auto-production with this thinly-plotted and rather unnecessary rehash of William Castle's classy fun-filled fright fest, which utilised the talents of an exceptionally hammy Vincent Price and had plenty of macabre laughs to keep things moving. Forty years later, only the quality of the special effects have improved, but the film falls down everywhere else. It's a sad state when the art of film-making actually appears to have gone into regression instead of progressing.This admittedly glossy production starts off on the right foot with an old-fashioned "inmates taking over the asylum" scene complete with bloody torture, gruesome murder, and a cameoing Jeffrey Combs as a crazed doctor complete with goggle glasses and a demented grin. From then on the film plays out much of the plot of the original, right down to the guns encased in little coffins, but it ruins things by actually making the film too complicated. While the first film had a nice, simple to follow plot with a clear beginning, middle, and end, the remake tries to have too many plot strands and ends up coming off as a muddled mess. It's a shame, really, as there are some really nice ideas swimming around in this mess of a film (I especially liked the bit with the video camera, and some of the artier supernatural moments).By the ending, things have predictably become routine, with the survivors running away from a special effect and trying not to get killed. Things are pretty frantic, but it all rings a bit hollow to tell the truth. The whole subplot concerning Price's wife having an affair with a guest is totally spoilt by having one too many twists and turns and ends up being pointless anyway as all three are dead by the end of the film. The acting is pretty bad; the actors and actresses here really should have learned the meaning of the word "restraint" as they ham for all they're worth, especially in the cases of Geoffrey Rush (a surprise, considering his recent Oscar winning) and Famke Janssen (annoying). The only thing of note about Rush is his uncanny resemblance to Vincent Price; otherwise, his hammy routine quickly becomes a bore. Of the rest of the cast, only Taye Diggs and Ali Larter come out with any respect, as the rest of the actors are a totally charisma-free bunch.The tone of this film is a light one, but oddly enough there are a number of very dark and grisly scenes too. These lie oddly together, and the film unsuccessfully tries to blend the horror and comedy genres, but sadly fails. Gore highlights basically consist of dismembered and mutilated corpses, which run the gamut from decapitation to total dissection. The special effects are good, yes, but it all gets a little CGI-heavy towards the ending. Once again we have some great SFX trapped in a below average film, with a clichéd and unoriginal plot and poor acting too. Whichever way you look at this, you're bound to be disappointed.</fullReview>

Judging from the rating and the hate in the other reviews I've read I found this actually quite a fair and respectful remake which attempted successfully to take it in a new direction. Geoffrey Rush gives a deliciously camp performance which is totally OTT but entirely suitable for the subject and the fact that he is playing a role previously played by the horror king Vincent Price. A great horror, with twists and turns, with a directing style that is quite 1960's Batman in a way but works well, producing an effect with proves unsettling, a great additional feature for a horror.</fullReview>

Forget the plot though, the best part of this film is the incredibly creepy individual scenes. In particular, the scene involving Mr. Price in the chamber seeing all sorts of disturbing and creepy things freaked me out. The ghost scene where Melissa disappears is also very creepy, and there are plenty of others.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised - 'House on Haunted Hill' was better than I expected. It's a very cheap, low quality movie, but it does serve a purpose if you're looking for something creepy that will freak you out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill (1999): Dir: William Malone / Cast: Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen, Taye Diggs, Peter Gallagher, Ali Larter: Barf bag embarrassment that never goes beyond its production values. The title is to evokes curiosity of the eerie sense of danger within the house, but viewers are only left with an eerie sense of stupidity for buying into it to begin with. Geoffrey Rush plays the owner of a chain of amusement parks where terror is the theme. He gives five individuals an opportunity to walk away with one million dollars if they can survive a night in his haunted house. Why not give five viewers that same cash for viewing this film? Apparently this house was built into an institution headed by a murderer whose spirit still dwells. From there it's a night of running, screaming and slaughter. Director William Malone allows everything to get away on him and his cast fare little better. Rush's Vincent Price impersonation is pitiful. Famke Janssen, Taye Diggs, Ali Larter, and Peter Gallagher also look dumb-ass foolish as morons who are murdered because they could not manage simple common sense to begin with. An actual Vincent Price film would be suitable entertainment as oppose to this. This is just graphic violence just for the sake of being depraved. The result here is a pointless gory garbage that should be crushed by a wrecking ball. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good cast in this, Geoffrey Rush is probably best utilized and Famke Janssen never looked better. I really like Chris Kattan, but I have mixed feelings on his character in this. He oddly goes from being the concerned prophet of doom to the character most blase about the situation very quickly, but he still has his moments.The movie really does embrace and modernize the William Castle "thrills and chills" style from the very beginning, starting with a horror sequence at a mental asylum that immediately moves into a fun roller-coaster sequence with a bit of light suspense. Once we get to the "house" of the title, the surprises begin. Some of these twists can be pretty contrived, but that's OK - it's all in silly fun.Comparing this to the other haunted house remake of 1999, The Haunting, this definitely has a more consistent tone and better characters, and though both movies have CGI creatures that arrive in the third act, House On Haunted Hill's monster is a little creepier and nowhere nearly as ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun remake of the 50's Vincent Price classic, "the House on Haunted Hill." Worth the price of admission for the chemistry alone between Geoffery Rush &amp; the ever beautiful Famke Janssen, as husband &amp; wife who don't exactly make holy matrimony, to say the least, as both think one is trying to kill the other. Funny dialog with a witty twist expound from both, as the guests look anxiously on, befuddled at the whole scenario.The guests make for good victim fodder, as their one dimensional characters. You'll have fun picking &amp; rooting for the ones you hope get killed next, &amp; that's exactly what their in this film for, to be murdered, one by one.Good pacing &amp; special effects make this one a fun amusement ride, though the roller-coaster falls off track in the end, otherwise I would've rated this a half star higher. Still, this film does not take it's self seriously, &amp; if you don't, this makes for a very good Halloween time watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when i first watched house on haunted hill i was scared outta my pants. even tho it was quite predictable it still has a few surprises around the corner. without a dough house on haunted hill is one of the scariest films of the slasher films. the plot is well thought of but abit confusing............ Stephen H. Price ( Geoffrey Rush) is a millionaire married to Evelyn Stockard-Price (Famke Janssen ). Evelyn decides her next birhtday is to take place in a house which is believed to be called house on haunted hill. mainly because of the terrifying past events that has happened there, murdering doctors getting murdered if that makes any sense.so he invites a couple of strangers to come and join the horror party including Eddie Baker (Taye Diggs) Sara Wolfe ( Ali Larter ) Blackburn ( Peter Galagher ) and last but by no means least Melissa Margaret Marr (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras)Stephan offers the strangers 1,0000 dollars to stay for the night, but they don't know that they will be stalked and in some cases murders by the ghosts of house on haunted hill. Watson Pritchett ( Chris Kattan ) who owns the house knows the house is haunted by the doctors who met deaths door there but decides to keep it a secret till its to late- the house turns to look down barricading all the doors windows which means no one leaves the house alive. i must say i was surprised that the action did start of very early on in the film. but i was even more surprised when very early on in the film it had a cliff hanger waiting to know if Malissa survived when the rest of the crew here her loud, frightening screams form half way across the house. that was a really good idea very early on in the movie.but after that house on haunted hill starts to slowly but surely go downhill. with every one splitting up knowing the house is after them dumb idea. but the biggest twist of all is when Evelyn kills Blackburn because she turns out to be a psycho. then when she meets her death i was wondering whats the point of watching this movie now?. the massive let down is the film is the big black ghost thing which is full of CGI which i had to laugh at that.but i also knew from the beginning who the survivors were going to be. BIG SPOILER Sara and Eddie were the surviours from the beginning.overall house on haunted hill delivers a lot of scares, jokes but fails to keep that feeling throughout the whole movie. i would however recommend this to a horror fan. 6star</fullReview>

That said, this is nothing but an enjoyable, if not grand, time-filler. The plot is of course ridiculous. What saves this film is the bizarre and actually wonderful energy Geoffrey Rush infuses into his role. Rather than adopt a Vincent Price drollery, he goes all out in a gleeful, active performance, and this film needs it. Then, as the hatred between husband and wife has been suitably amped up for modern times, Famke Jannsen delivers beauty and menace quite nicely as Mrs. Price. PS Strange thing - the cameraman in the brief, early theme park scene looked so familiar, so I came here to track him down. James Marsden (sp?). of the 'Angel' series and more. Doing a one-line bit?

Chris Kattan stars along with Peter Gallagher, Famke Jansen and Geoffrey Rush in this comedy horror gem. The special effects are first-rate, and the acting is just arch enough for us to enjoy the intermittently bloody proceedings. For Ali Larter fans, she probably gets it the worst.

		<shortDescription>A Tribute More Than A Remake (Fortunately!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching William Malone's "House On Haunted Hill" of 1999 I was quite skeptical, as William Castle's original of 1959 starring the great Vincent Price is a brilliant spooky classic, and 90s remakes of Horror classics (such as the dreadful "Haunting" remake)usually tend to suck. The "House On Haunted Hill" remake, however, is fortunately a homage to the original more than just a remake, and even though it comes nowhere near the brilliance of the brilliance and eeriness of the original, it is an entertaining and quite creepy little Horror fan that genre-fans should enjoy. Especially Geoffrey Rush's performance is a pure tribute to the great Vincent Price. Rush's character is even named Stephen Price in the honor of this great horror icon. Vincent Price is one of my favorite actors of all-time, and Rush, who is also a great actor, does a great job making his performance a tribute to Price.Six strangers are offered a million dollars each, by the eccentric millionaire Stephen H. Price (Rush). In order to get the money, they have to attain a party thrown by Price and his equally sinister wife (Famke Jansen). This party is to take place in an eerie huge mansion, a former mental institution with a murderous past, that is supposed to be haunted...What makes this film interesting are the performances of Geoffrey Rush, who, as mentioned above, pays adequate tribute to the great Vincent Price, and sexy Famke Jansen, who is equally great and sinister as his femme-fatale wife. The creepiest moments in the film, however, are provided by Horror icon Jeffrey Combs, who is genuinely scary in his small role. The rest of the performances are solid, but not spectacular. The film also makes a good effort to build up a gloomy atmosphere, and the well-made gore effects are an additional quality. I would definitely recommend to watch the (incomparably greater) 1959 original first, but this 1999 remake is also a highly entertaining film that outshines the majority of (mostly awful) Horror remakes of the 90s. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One night. Haunted abandon asylum. One million dollars. Why not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this I wasn't much of a fan, and that wasn't due to comparing it to the original, as I hadn't seen Castle's 1958 version. Again while it isn't boring, due mainly to Geoffrey Rush's effectively diverting Vincent Price send up, and a saucy Famke Janssen. What we get is something of pretty sub-standard quality that heavily relies on glossy special effects, nasty blood spatter and contrived shocks of the tiresome kind. Dick Beebe's screenplay of Robb White's original story ups the twists, and unpleasant nature in a straight laced supernatural story. Even with its constant twists, it felt like they were there to cover how slight the premise was. The angle is more so serious and dark, though at times with a somewhat mock attitude compared with the plain outlandish, and overly campy style of the original. Which did make that one far more enjoyable, even with the usual haunted house devices. Here director William Malone goes about things in a conventionally slick, ultra-kinetic manner where it was just too streamlined (this being the art direction of the sombre looking house) and packed with many unconvincingly elaborated twists, and heavy handed jump scares that lacked any sort of unsettling punch. The basic "let's go for something that sounds really scary" music score, couldn't escape its generic notes of telegraphed predictability. At least the deaths are fairly twisted, and the morbid flair of Rush and Janssen's interplay is an unpredictable delight. The special effects weren't terrible and there a few well pulled off moments (like the jittery ghost doctors), but overall it didn't enhance or cook up much of a lasting atmosphere when they finally pile it on far too much. The final 15 minutes is a fine example. Ali Carter aggregately fluffs around, and Taye Riggs pretty much has that concerned face throughout. Peter Gallagher, Bridgette Wilson and Max Perlich make up the numbers. Jeffery Combs also appears in a spooky cameo part, that called out for more screen time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall I enjoy this movie but there's one element which just ruins the whole thing, the beginning of the end. The movie is quite a suspense filled movie, a lot of time spent wondering what is causing the things to happen....its all great until they decide to show the the "darkness" of the house. This turned the movie from being a straight up suspense horror to being a supernatural comedy. The darkness was a terrible thing to add, it would've been much better if it was Vannacutt's spirit killing everyone. You see Vannacutt on the CCTV monitor, he does his spasm thing then brings the operating tool to his face...this was generally quite a freaky/spooky moment. If there was more of Vannacutt I feel it would've been a lot more scary.Really the movie is a good one until the "darkness" appears. I don't think its anything to do with the computer graphics being poor, or because the movie has aged etc...i feel the reason is it just doesn't fit. It's a terrible way to end the movie, they should've just kept you guessing what was causing all the death...was it Vannacutt, was it just an attempt to scare people gone too far?before the ending i would give this movie 9, but because of the whole crap filled ending it only gets a 7.</fullReview>

The shot selection bounced so much I began having a headache. The only movie with more cuts was probably Domino. The ending was sub-par. The movie seemed to want to incorporate too many themes for one horror movie: killer husband/wife, haunted house, deranged surgeons, ancient evil, etc. The best part of the movie was that at very least they had the decency to set the tone early to let you know what was going to be coming at you.

		<fullReview>Who ever said that abandoned insane asylums are creepy? Well, William Malone thought they were. By remaking one of the greatest horror classic into a more frightening and disturbing tale and turning the original Ennis House into a huge creepy 60+ year old insane asylum. In this rendition the partygoers are dared to spend the night in the old house to compete for 1 million dollars but the house has ghosts, literally crazy ghosts and one crazy doctor. Apparently in the 30's, when the institution was at its prime, the patients rebelled against the head doctor, killed him and the staff and burnt the place down. Sound interesting, right? The movie gets scarier and more graphically disturbing than that.The partygoers all have guilty pleasures and the chemistry between Stephen and Evelyn Price is comedy gold and a bit dysfunctional at a lot of times. Geoffrey Rush magnificently plays Stephen Price and he looks, even with the fake thin mustache, like Vincent Price. The caretaker, Watson Pritchett, played by Chris Kattan is a sarcastic alcoholic who believes that the house is really haunted. Even though his character is morally and mentally unstable, he adds humor when the time needs it. Jeffery Combs is the twisted Dr. Vannacutt and although his character is a supporting character, he is still pretty cool to watch.The main things that make this movie scary is some of the new things that Malone incorporated into this film. One: the Saturation Chamber, which is a huge steel zoetrope with strobe lights. It was used to treat schizophrenia. This scene was not only a strain on the eyes but also one of the most disturbing scenes in the whole movie, considering the dream sequence and the ghosts that were in it. Two: the morgue and the huge tanks of blood. Three: the electroshock room and the physical features of the ghosts them selves. To describe what they look like would be pretty hard, but I will say this, they look twisted and deformed.I will recommend this movie to anybody who loves psychotic and drugged out horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why in the world would do this to House on Haunted Hill? I know remakes usually change a few things and remove other things, but did they really have to change the entire background story, names, and the amount of money given? I think I'd like this movie a lot more if it weren't a remake, but as long as they use the title House on Haunted Hill, it's a remake and should at show the basic background to be the same. I can see them altering it a bit because, let's face it, the dialog in the original wasn't that great. But to go from a house with multiple, and for the most part, unrelated murders to an insane asylum where a doctor did horrible things to his patients is a bit of a stretch. But as I said, a fairly good movie if it didn't make itself out to be a remake and I would probably love it otherwise. I just don't think remakes should deviate as far as this did from the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But the ending? What the hell was that about? A load of swirly black shadows and faces never scared anyone, and doesn't explain anything either!Although I did find it quite scary (I cope better with films like Saw than films involving ghosts/zombies/mutants/mental patients), it left me un-satisfied and a little ticked off that a film that started out quite well ended up so crappily.As well as that, I watched the film knowing nothing about it. I thought it would be a proper haunted house (not a mental institution) so the fact that it was a scary place where the criminally insane had rebelled against their psychotic, mental patient butchering doctor was quite a nice surprise.But apart from that, I didn't enjoy it much at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House on Haunted Hill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I was only 9 or 10, and it kept me scared for about two years, even though I only saw about five minutes of it. The first time I saw it, I only saw the scene where Melissa Margaret Marr(Bridgette Wilson) (hot) is walking in the underground asylum videotaping, which I thought was very eerie, and I remember thinking that when it happened. The entire asylum just looked creepy and scared me. Then, to cap it off, she gets mutilated by something and a glimpse is caught on her camera. I also got to see her body parts hanging in the freezer, which FREAKED ME OUT!!!!!!! I just recently saw the entire thing about three weeks ago, which is odd because I remembered that scene for some reason and wanted to see the movie all the way through, and then it was on. Anywho, the movie. I think its good and scary. It really keeps you guessing the entire time. Is the house really haunted, or is it just the millionaire couple trying to scare each other? The movie has its own score and music that was composed for it, which add to the effect very nicely. The acting is very good, but it seems that you only get a little bit of screen time from each actor. The ghost doctor's movements is enough to scare anyone for life, and it still does scare me sometime's. I won't lie, the ending is sort of a let down. I was hoping that the ghosts would have bigger roles as the movie goes on, but Melissa is the only character to really have any paranormal encounters, and she dies right after having one. The plot is pretty simple to follow and the characters are all interesting, but I think we could have discovered more about their background. Eddie was a pro baseball player, but he isn't anymore. Melissa was on a game show, but she was cancelled. It would have been interesting to find out more about the characters, but that could easily get the movie off topic.All in all, I think that this is a good movie. It has good music, a good plot, and good acting. If you really like ghost movies or horror movies in general, you might like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. With the exception of one casting flaw the characters are a great mix of contrasting personalities that play off each other well. Geoffrey Rush is perfect as the reluctant group's ringleader and adds a tone of energy and dark comedy to the film. The soundtrack and audio effects were right on the money. The sets, lighting, and themes were perfect. You have to love a film with confusing passages, darkly lit, decades old, with each room having it's own theme. The directors and producers could have done a lot more with the house, made the movie even longer, and it would have been fine with me. What also works is the limited characters in the film mostly confined to one location, the house. The only thing that struck me as odd is the casting of Larter and Wilson. They are so similar they could have been sisters. I would gone with a different actress for Wilson's character who would have played a better opposite for Larter, but with the same grim results. I would be interested to know if there was an extended cut or directors release on this one, but I am afraid I am stuck with the great copy I have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ALMOST As Good As The Original. Not Quite, But Almost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first third runs slowly, with no exposition, successfully building the required atmosphere to pull off the twisted tale herein. Exposition does come, but well after the second third of this work kicks into high gear and begins to seemingly run on its own. The final third leaves a great deal to be desired, in that it offers a flaccid ending to what was otherwise a monumental cinematic undertaking.In spite of that weakness, if you are a fan of the original work, you may still enjoy this modern attempt, as it provides a creepy 2 hours' viewing, delivers some good performances and good story, and does manage to entertain through the somewhat edge of your seat atmosphere.All in all, it isn't as bad as some say. On the other hand, it has also been overrated by some fans of the genre. I must say that I didn't love it, but I DID enjoy it.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The major flaw in this movie, as I see it, Is the idea that the lead characters would continue to move from the relative sanity of the living room to the relative insanity of the basement - which seemed to consist of one staircase and two or three hallways - repeatedly DESPITE the apparent dangers each one suffered at each visit.Promise me a million dollars by morning and you'll find me safe on the couch in front of the fire, sipping my toddy, waiting for the evil to find ME.Blood is not scary. Insane doctors are much more frightening for what they are THINKING or PLANNING rather than what they are doing or had done. I refer to the surgery scene - the nurse was CREEPY - but the scalpel thing - while gross - I could picture as actually more painful than how I would screw with an insane patient if I were twisted.Fair entertainment value - not a great find.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But thats not a minus. With enough body parts and bullets, twists and turns, murder and mayhem to last the length of the movie it doesn't NEED anything in common with the first. (Side note: I liked the first, I'm a big Vincient Price fan, and I don't generally care for remakes.) This flick stands well on its own. Very good players, along with spooky sets, good continuity, and really well done special effects, this thing basically rocks. The premise is cool, jealous spouses, haunted asylum, totally "unaware" guests, put that all together and this thing makes for a good scare. Which is what its all about. Kicker? I liked the name they gave one of the main characters. ... Mr. Price. THAT was way cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie, I had to sit and mull it over for a little bit... Seeing as how some horror movies tend to have me seeing their characters in the dark, I probably could've made a better decision than to watch this at night... In the dark... Alone...But that's not the point. When I first sat down to watch this, I instantly remembered the 'Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror episode when the family had to spend the night in the haunted house (spoofing this movie)... But that's not the point either...I remember starting to get a little freaked out when I saw the trail of the girl's blood end and the characters said she "disappeared into the house." I looked up at my ceiling a little nervous... Anyway, this seems to be one of those hate it or love it movies, except for me, of course. Those into hardcore horror might feel that this movie didn't really meet their standards, but those who just want to get a little freaked might consider this movie.Although, at the point when they showed what had really happened in the house before, I had to look away halfway through. I know, I'm a pansy, but that was a little gross! Just to warn you when that comes on, if you scare a little easier than the guy whose seen the movie a billion times and cheers for the black stuff to eat Price.That was the other thing. When Price made it to the roof and the dead people confronted Eddie, I started getting that doubtful feeling, like, "Now this is getting pretty unbelievable, and not the good way..." There's a fine line between frightening and just plain dumb, and that scene crossed the line for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monster House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A solid horror flick, unfortunately. The original House on Haunted Hill is my favorite all time scary movie, and the new one doesn't measure up. First of all, this isn't a remake. A remake is a movie that follows the same plot and has the same title. This movie has the same title, but the original plot line about the gold digging wife and doctor trying to murder a millionaire was relegated to a poorly developed sub-plot. To be fair I understand why they removed some of the more ridiculous items such as the walking skeleton and the acid bath. I feel the addition of real ghosts makes it to much like the remake of The Huanting (which in the trailer was entitled The Haunting of Hill House, seem familiar) which came out the same year.The characters needed some work. Geoffrey Rush makes a better Peter Sellers that Vincent Price. He was creepy, but seems to try to hard. While Vincent Price was creepy because that's what Vincent Price was. Taye Diggs is in it. He's a solid actor but when he is an a movie I have to listen to my sisters talk about how hansom they say he is. Elisha Cook Jr.'s character Watson Pritchard was played by Chris Kattan which I wasn't to sure of at first, I'm not a particular fan of anything he's done since SNL. After I thought about it; however, I could only think of one actor who could have played the original Pritchard as well Kattan could have and that would have been Jon Lovitz. Unfortunately the new film removes Pritchard from the role of comic relief, and makes him more of a guide and prophet of doom.Oh, and the other thing I disliked about this version of the film is the sincere lack of wax figures on roller skates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some frightening scenes but ending is disappointing...worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some great scenes of horror in this remake, as well as tongue-in-cheek, self- aware humor. But towards the end the plot holes are glaring and the finale minutes are stupid, stupid, stupid and not scary at all, which is a shame because the rest of the movie is tense and creepy. To its credit, there are plenty of effective scares as well as a creepy, dread-filled atmosphere. The sets are fantastic - I sure wouldn't want to spend a night there...ever. After a very cool credits, it opens with a particularly disturbing scene in a mental institution. The patients are brutally murdering the doctors in various horrific, hellish manners. Another effective scene is when Ali Larter's character is chasing after Taye Diggs. He falls into a vat of blood and whilst trying to save him, she hears him say, "What the hell are you doing?" Another scene involves an operating table viewed through a video camera. The acting is convincing (minus Taye Diggs). Geoffrey Rush's character is a little over-the- top which takes you out of it a little. Chris Kattan is funny and probably the most convincing. Jeffrey Combs has the creepiest scenes. What was most impressive about this film is the beautiful images of horror, particularly a sequence in a "saturation chamber". The images are inspired by JACOB'S LADDER. This is so impressive because of how surreal, bizarre, disturbing, and terrifying the images are. It starts out with a picture of a man in a tuxedo bouncing a ball. He then becomes a real man and the speed at which he's bouncing is incredibly fast as he smiles at the camera. There's nothing seemingly frightening about this but it manages to be the most terrifying moment in the film. We then see various images that are truly the stuff of nightmares - dark, freaky, and unreal. The effects and editing are top-notch (minus the ending, where even the gore is tacky). Many modern horror films (Hostel, Saw) have been inspired by the style of editing and sound in this film.They should've kept with the psychiatric theme - by far the scariest element of the film. Unfortunately, the rest of the film does not live up to the disturbing scenes involving the mental institution and its primitive, horrific practices. It's worth viewing if you're a horror fan and haven't already seen this. It's got some sequences that'll make your heart pound and your blood run cold - if you let it...one thing I've learned from watching hundreds of horror movies over the years is that the only way to have fun watching horror films is to let yourself get scared. "Real-life" horror dealing with killers (Halloween, Saw, Seven, High Tension) does not have even close to the same effect that supernatural horror has on me (The Ring, The Grudge, Jacob's Ladder, The Exorcist). If you're one of those horror fans, definitely check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big horror film buff and i've always thought that films that took place in a haunted house always seemed to fail to do anything for me. The Haunting is just one of them. This film i watched wondering whether i would enjoy it or not, but after watching the film i was surprised quite a bit.Geoffrey Rush organizes a birthday party for his wife who wants to host it in an old sanitarium that is supposed to be haunted. The guests are all strangers who do not know why they have been called to the place but when Rush offers them each a million dollars to spend the night there they all accept to stay there but when things start to wrong and people start dying a million dollars just doesn't seem enough anymore! This is definitely one of the better horror in a house pictures i have seen as it seems to have something about it that you just like for me it had to be Geoffrey Rush's almost over the top character who you may mistake for looking like Vincent Price star of the original film.The other characters seem to play well off one another but you really couldn't care less for them as the basic intention is that you really should be caring for Geoffrey Rush because he is set up so well.The sets are just fantastic and really help this film come onto its own with the very creepy corridors and the many rooms in the house. You really never know whether something will jump out at you or not which is kind of fun.The direction is pretty good but lacks in many places which is a shame because there really was a good story here with lots of potential but the director and the cast fail to reach new heights with this haunted house picture.Of course this is a remake and as we know from experience remakes often suffer and it is very rare they beat the original and this certainly does not, sure we have advanced in technology but that doesn't mean we have advanced the story or its potential.Overall i think this is a good watch with a few creepy scenes and some scares but don't hold your breath for anything original.***** out of **********</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not expecting this movie to be anything great, or even scary when I popped it into the DVD player. I had heard so many bad things that from the beginning I thought it was going to be incredibly stupid. It wasn't...at first. It starts off very clever, and even had my heart racing in a few scenes, and that doesn't happen very often when I watch scary movies. The atmosphere is great, some of the scenes are incredibly scary, and then at about an hour through, the atmosphere takes a dive with the "twists", which didn't necessarily ruin the movie in themselves. Being a remake of a Vincent Price movie, I was expecting a little bit of "oh, come on!" so I wasn't totally bothered at first. However, with the first bit of the corny comes an all out bomb of an ending. I was not so upset with the computer animation being so terrible, I thought they could have made it work if it lead to something of a decent ending...it didn't. Where halfway through the movie I was clutching the seat of my chair and grimacing, at the beginning of the credits I was scrunching my brow in a "give me a break, what the hell was that?" kind of look. It's as if halfway through the filming of the movie they switched to someone completely amateur both in writing and in filming. The scaryness was wrung out of the entire movie with one of Digg's last lines, which I won't say here, but you'll probably know it when you hear it. I gave this 6 out of 10 because a little more than half of is actually really good, the rest takes a dive into cheesy writing, terrible special effects, and a "give me a break" ending. If you want to be scared when you walk away from this movie, turn it off just after halfway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that as a child of CGI movies I am not easily spooked, but this one really gets me going. The whole setting is truly unnerving. The movie sets you up, leading you to think all the scary stuff is a farce, but everywhere there are hints of the REAL evil lurking in the shadows. Every time I watch it I have a "OMG, did you see that?" moment, and end up hitting the rewind button. A hint....keep your eyes on the stained glass ceiling.There is a grotesquerie of a scene related to a device called The Chamber I could have done without, but it definately gets it point across. Combined with the gore-factor (which is done quite well), it keeps you riveted and maybe even a little nauseous. Rush is a fantastic Price look-alike, and Famke Jansen really does the evil b**** well. For me, Chris Kattan is the shining light of this movie, providing hilarious mood-lightening lines when things seem at their darkest, though his best lines are in the beginning. He eventually fades to the background when the movie really gets going. He should go for quasi-serious roles more often. And of course, he looks so good in a suit and glasses. The background music is entertaining as well, especially Marilyn Manson's cover of "Sweet Dreams". This movie will creep you out. Granted the ending is a tad perplexing, but it's forgivable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begining worth it, ending not!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I'm the world's biggest Vincent Price fan. So I had seen the original "House On Haunted Hill" Several times. When they decided to show the updated version on tv, I thought "why not?" I wanted to see how they would ruin a classic. Now I know the original isn't the best movie in the world, in fact it's not really all that good, but like I said, it's all about Vincent Price. He made the movie for me. If he weren't in it, I wouldn't have liked it. Anyway, back to the newer version. The begining was GREAT!!! I love the whole goth feel. When Geoffrey Rush appeared on screen, I was like "It's Vincent Price ressurected!" And then Lisa Loeb's character calls him "Mr. Price" and I fell out of my chair. I thought that was very clever to change the character's name like that. Paying tribute to the great Mr. Price himself. So they have the guest arrive in hurses like in the original, and they have the guns in the little coffins, and the wife cheating with the doctor and trying to kill the husband. They left out some things I would've liked left in. The vat of acid was a nice touch in the original. And Price(real or otherwise) out to get his wife back. Of course in the original he does kill her and the doctor. The sets were really cool, the music was eerie, the whole asylum thing was great(including the comic book like flashback), and Geoffrey Rush was absolutely amazing!! He played his character really well. Chris Katan, and Famke were good as well. Peter Gahlleger was ok, but the rest were horrible. Now on to the ending. IT SUCKED!!! The minute that ink-blot looking, bunch of ghost put together thing popped up, the movie lost it's touch. The ending just ruined the whole feel of it all. It was so good(despite some of the other characters underdevelopment) up until that point. They should have had the husband throw the doctor in the vat of acid, and then scare the wife into it too. I liked the freaky effects before then however. Like the shaking ghost and the weird images. And when the first person to die, that blonde girl, when she looks into the camera and sees the ghosts, and they look at her, that was nice. They could've left her missing, and never explain it. Ya know, as they're walking out the door in the morning, one of them can turn to the others and say "Wait. Whatever happened to (insert whatever her name here)?" And then they all turn back and have this "I'm not going back in there" look. That would've been cool. But alas, the real ending upset me dearly!!! I was thinking "hey, is there an alternate ending?" Anyway, all I have to say is, it's worth watching, and very good, especially Geoffrey Rush, just stop the movie toward the ending.</fullReview>

I expected more from a movie that was supposed to be such a classic thriller-I never even saw the original 1959 version-however, if this "state of the art" version was so lame, then I'd hate to waste my time on the black and white version. Also, I didn't quite understand the point of the house to murder their descendants. It just didn't add up. And the cheesy part at the end where Taye Diggs declares that he was adopted, thus preventing him from the ghosts' wrath-pure garbage. I think anyone would be better off passing this one up on the video rental shelf-catch it for free on cable instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the original "House on Haunted Hill" I was not sure if this remake would be like a "B" movie or updated, and updated it was. It started out fast and terrifying with an a "amusement park" operated by Steven Price, (the name Price was a nice gesture towards Vincent Price) who scares some reporters with a falling elevator. This remake was very true to the original with a wife that wants to kill her husband. What is the big difference in the movies, the amount of money spent for special effects. The 1999 version spends the money with excellent effects. This is an enjoyable film for fans of the original and even for those that never saw it.</fullReview>

All those different sources of story conflict make the film look murky and confusing. It looks like the filmmakers kept changing their minds as they went along, tossing in anything to see what might work. Without a commitment to a single strong source of conflict for the film's heroes, none of it does. The film is a mixed bag of potential that goes unrealized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Old Folks Saturation Chamber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dig this movie, for a number of reasons. While the acting isn't always top notch and the overall story is kinda goofy, this movie delivers in the one area it was meant to: chills. There are certain scenes in this movie that leave you feeling abused. One scene in particular has one of the main characters left in a "saturation chamber", a huge tank that is used to make the sane insane and vice versa by bombarding them with sounds and images. That scene alone beats out The Haunting remake in it's entirety. A lot of the images stay with you, my personal favorite being the strange ghost/spirit/monster/shadow thing. It is hands down one of the creepiest looking things I have ever seen in a movie. This movie has more than a couple of flaws but I think they're pretty easy to overlook. The plot demands serious suspension of disbelief. The ending is kinda blah. Then again, this movie wasn't going for Oscars and it's pretty obvious. There's really not enough jump-out-of your seat scares but there might be a couple depending on how much of a priss you are. There's a good amount of gore, so if that's your thing you might appreciate what's offered here. A couple of great death scenes, above average special effects, make-up and otherwise and you have yourself a decent flick to watch on a Saturday night. For DVD collectors, the DVD is near reference quality, boasting an awesome picture and great surround sound. I recommend this movie only if you're looking for an entertaining hour and a half, not an AFI Top 100 film. Rating: *** out of *****.</fullReview>

The Vincent Price version is more tongue and cheek. Both hovevalue. If your in a dark mood, and want blood and guts theater, thisisn't a bad choice. But if you want fun with your horror, pick up theversion with Vincent Price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really scary (to me, anyway) and very, very gory. I thought the acting was good, but it was obvious from the start which two characters were going to get out alive. Oh, and the best part of the movie is the beginning, with that darn sexy cameraman, played by James Marsters. Overall, I would recommend seeing this flick....but only for a mindless day of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the terrible, modern, attempt at re-making "The Haunting", I was surprised to find I enjoyed this film. The pace is quite fast and you don't have to wait too long for the inevitable killings. One thing that struck me (not really a spoiler) is that the characters quickly learn something is very wrong inside the house, as opposed to other "stranded in a haunted house" movies where the last person alive still insists there's nothing wrong.SO yeah, I can think of worse movies to waste my life watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though it's ostensibly directed (within an inch of its life) by William Malone, the real sensibilities behind this remake of William Castle's 1958 horror film seem to be those of producers Robert Zemeckis and Joel Silver, essentially reprising for the big screen the gore and shock value of their HBO series `Takes From The Crypt'. While there's plenty of gore and some mild shocks, it's not really scary but it probably wasn't intended to be--there's too much of an effort to mimic (or pay homage to--you decide) the horror genre while trying to update it for today's young, inured audiences. There's also a conscious attempt at camp in Dick Beebe's script which falls flat thanks to a cast which apparently isn't in on the joke. Geoffrey Rush, as an amusement park magnate, is the star (apparently James Woods wasn't available because Rush turns in an excellent impersonation); he lures five people to a `haunted' house with the promise of one million dollars apiece if they can survive the night. Naturally, the house turns out to be really haunted. Though there's some nice deco production design by David F. Klassen, the special effects are hit-or-miss, the cheesier ones probably not intentional. With some pretty good performances by Famke Janssen, Chris Kattan and Jeffrey Combs (from' Re-Animator') and some not so good ones by Bridgette Wilson, Peter Gallagher (that hair!), Taye Diggs and Ali Larter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much to say about `The House on Haunted Hill'. It's one of those pointless remakes Hollywood likes to indulge itself in. The plot's ridiculously simple ? six strangers are invited to spend a night in a haunted house, with the last one left gaining $1,000,000. It's originally set up as a trick party by an eccentric billionaire, but soon it turns out the house ? a former mental asylum where patients were tortured ? is gasp, really haunted!So what we have is the usual fare ? stock character types, zany deaths and lashings of SFX. The plot's too thin to be of any note and the script isn't substantial enough to flesh it out. This is one of the film's big flaws ? there's a sense of meandering about from death to death with little in the way of any bridging material. This leads to a lack of tension, with the few surprises relegated to mere shrugs of `I don't really care'. The characters themselves are mere sketches, which is what you tend to expect in movies where you anticipate most of the cast to end up too dead to return for a sequel. The fact is though they're not even particularly likable so that their deaths leave the viewer untouched. This isn't helped by the fact that you're left somewhat bored by the uneven pacing of the whole thing.The direction here, by William Malone, is okay. The look is typically dark, the SFX are adequate, and the camera work unmemorable. There is at least a certain tongue-in-cheek nature to the proceedings, acknowledging the sheer campness of the piece with its implausible plots and hammy acting, but that can't save the movie from just leaving you bored, and subsequently forgetting about it the moment the credits appear. Avoid? Just don't bother instead. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable remake of the 50's fright classic, with a contemporary update. Director Malone gives this horror film a stylish look, and he really can't go wrong with actors like Rush, Janssen and Coombs onboard. Add to that great FX, sets, sound and lighting and it is definitely worth seeing if you are a horror fan. It's good to see a real 'haunted house' picture given the current crop of below average teen slasher flicks.I think this film got a bad rap, but I can't see why. A lot of reviewers seem to have missed several plot points which perhaps detracted from their enjoyment of the film. Also, the comments re poor quality CGI are misguided. 95% of the FX in this film are optical composites, not CGI.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was bored. Spotting 'House on Haunted Hill' underneath my brother's video player, I decided to pop it in and see what it was like.Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations.One of the main reasons for this being that it is only something like 85 minutes long, and I found that it is a bit too slow to start and then suddenly picks up the pace about 3 quarters of the way through the film when it should have been like that all along. The film is set in a haunted house and 6 strangers are invited to spend the night with the chance to win $1,000,000 each...in cash. They have been invited there by a Steven Price who is a rich guy who owns some theme parks. But wait, it turns out that he didn't invite them, the house did, because, yes you've guessed it, it's haunted!..yeah, right. Anyway, when it was over I was very disappointed and plan to rid myself of the said video tape at the next car boot sale I attend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill is a remake of the original one that came out a long time ago.Unlike the original,this one has more dark scary elements that the original didnt have.This one is alot more gorier than the original,but it is not as entertaining as the original.House on Haunted Hill delivers great chills,disturbing images,great acting that makes the movie even scarier,and great gore effects.This remake of the original is almost a completely different movie,instead of a small house,this one has tall house,instead of only one person dying,many people die.But the most fatal flaw in House on Haunted Hill,is that it may sometimes get boring,because it takes a little bit for the movie to reach it's gore fest.Best part of the movie is the beginning sequence were all the mental people in the asylum attack all the doctors,worst part of the movie is that it takes a while to get bloody and freaky.If you like great horror movies,watch this movie,but if you have a weak stomach,dont watch this movie.William Castle would be proud.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)By the end of this movie, there was one question that stuck in my head, "What?"In short, this is a film that tries to be a comedy and a horror, but succeeds in being neither. It is more like a whole lot of bad 'horror sketches' put together, with a link between them that is so tenuous, it is almost impossible to see.At the start there is a dark, rather gruesome showing of the history of the 'House on Haunted Hill'. This scene is pointless, as it is quite clear in the main section of the movie what happened in this place, so, in actual fact, the movie probably would've been better off without this scene.Next came a scene about the 'main character' of sorts, where he was talking to a news reporter about his horror theme parks. Now this, I have to say, is probably THE single most useless scene I have seen for some time. Not to mention the fact that it was utterly irrelevant. What this scene showed could have, and was, said in one line in the movie.Following this there was a scene where the 'main character' wrote a list, but it was hacked and changed by someone / thing. Nice, but, once again, pointless. Once again, this need not have been shown at all, it was mentioned in the main section of the movie anyway.Then we get to the House on Haunted Hill.And what happens in this main section of the movie?Well, in a typically cliched horror vein, the characters split up, in order to find a way out, rather than all going together, in a place where any other normal person would have realised that the place was quite dangerous...sigh.Then one of the characters died. And a quote from the movie sums it up entirely, "No one saw it though".That's right, nor does anyone get it. I mean if this woman was stupid enough to walk around in this place by herself, she DESERVED to die.Also there was this computer guy who dies.That's it. He is there, does virtually nothing, before being killed.?Also typically, the characters don't trust each other. Now you'd think that'd have some bearing on the film.Nope. In the end, it didn't matter, they still died. And the characters' relationships changed anyway.?Then there was a stretch where it seemed the scriptwriter or director couldn't make their mind up who had committed the murder, and/or who was the villain of the piece.With characters appearing to die, but the viewer then finding they actually didn't, but then watching them die again, the film was quickly becoming confusing. Even saying it sounds confusing.What was the writer thinking? This entire stretch of film made absolutely no sense.Then along comes this shadow thing. This is where the film just collapses. For this shadow, there are so many questions, only one of which is half answered (what it is), but even in the answering, it creates more questions.For instance, (1) What is it doing there? (2) Why is it doing what it's doing? (3) What is it's motivation for doing what its doing? (4) How did it come into being? (5) Why did it come into being? (6) What is it's point?And the list goes on...This is because there is no lead up to the introduction of this 'character'. In the moments before it, you almost know what is happening, and when it appears, you don't, but this isn't the mysterious kind of confusing, it just the scratching the head kind of confusion. Suddenly the shadow is there, and the viewer has absolutely no idea why it is there.Then the surviving characters run around a bit, and then the film finishes.This is a finish that doesn't even really deserved to be mentioned, it somehow transcends badness.On the bright side, some of the acting work is good, and the actual sets are decent.Conclusion - if you're looking for a horror movie with a plot - or even horror in your horror movie - don't come here. You'll just be left at the end scratching your head, thinking "WHAT?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House On Haunted Hill. Intense. Original. Bizarre. SCARY! Let me repeat that: SCARY! But should I expect less considering all of the Tales From The Crypt alumni on board. From the eerie opening credits to the just deserts of our main characters after the film, this one packs a punch. The film takes an already great premise (set up by Castle and White), and builds on it. It really grows on me. I like it more, the more I see it. Did I mention that it's scary. This one is all about the atmosphere. The sets are dead on horrific. Sometimes it's like watching a really wild Tool video. The cast does a terrific job of selling the scares to boot. Geoffrey Rush, who plays Steven Price (an homage to Vincent), pulls off the look and presence of Vincent Price, the showmanship of William Castle, and the character of Frederick Loren flawlessly. His hybrid of characters is really fun to watch. Famke Janssen is absolutely gorgeous as Price's plotting wife, Chris Kattan plays an excellent Watson Pritchett, and Peter Gallagher is divinely evil. Last but not least, Jeffrey Combs' Dr. Vannacut is as creepy as anything I've ever seen. The saturation chamber sequence is unbelievably awesome. There are many scenes I could point out, but it's scarier just to watch for yourself. So, horror fans, don't miss this one. Although I was slightly disappointed with Thir13en Ghosts, I can't wait for the next remake from Dark Castle (possibly Macabre).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a new horror classic. Writer Dick Beebe has something going for himself. He is one of the best writers available today. And the cast was all right. Chris Kattan was a riot as Prichett. PLOT: *SPOILERS* For her birthday party, Evelyn Price (Famke Janssen) tells her husband, Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush) to invite a large number of guests to a haunted house. But instead, five strangers are invited. Each of them have the chance to win one million dollars. All they have to do is spend the night in the house....alive. Soon, ghosts and other creepy things that go bump in the night are after them, and they must all struggle to survive. This movie was one that is sure to creep audiences out for many years to come. Taye Diggs again steals the pretty white girl (Ali Larter), which I think is a little stupid to have the black guy take the white girl. That is a little wrong. The other guests include Bridgette Wilson as a mean, cruel TV shot host, Peter Gallagher as a Medical Doctor and Chris Kattan as Watson Pritchett, the owner of the house. The scariest part is when Bridgette Wilson meets her demise at the hands of a moaning ghost in a darkened corridor. I thought that part was pretty creepy. That part will give you nightmares for a week. I really liked the segment where all the guests are arriving to the house to the music of Marilyn Manson in the background. MANSON IS THE KING! So, I'm gonna give HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL 5/5 just because of Manson. OK! Just kidding......5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was an insult.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, the makers of this film really underestimated the minds of moviegoers. I watched "House on Haunted Hill" a few months after it came out on video. I didn't even pay attention completely. It rarely kept my attention, except for two parts: the elevator scene and the scene in which Ali Larter runs to a pool of red gooey stuff (I hope that wasn't supposed to be blood) thinking she saw Taye Diggs fall into it.It was on TV a few days ago, so I said to myself "Let me see what was so bad." This film came out the same year as "The Haunting," which is, by no means, a great flick, but it was knocked by many, many critics, while "House" was virtually ignored. Can you remember word-of-mouth about this movie being bad? I can't either, and that's why I think "The Haunting" got such a bad rap.I will say, though, that "The Haunting" is "Citizen Kane" next to this mess. I am not expecting one of the 10 best films of all time, and I know horror films are not supposed to take themselves seriously. But this was ridiculous, people! I really am curious how much these big-name actors were paid, because I like most of them. I find it hard to believe that they'd really willingly sign on to this project. All it did was make them look like bad actors. It didn't even look like they were having fun.Many say "Don't take it so seriously." Trust me. No one who laughs at what is supposed to be even sorta scary is taking ANYthing seriously. This movie seemed too obviously a rushed script and production.Specifics: the bitchy dialogue between Rush and Janssen was NOT funny, the supposedly witty one-liners of Chris Kattan and Bridgitte Wilson were NOT clever, the attempt for a subplot as to why those people ended up there did NOT work, and that moving mass of ghosts thingy was just NOT scary! When I laughed during this movie, it was when I was not supposed to. When I looked upset, it was when I was supposed to laugh. Only the two above-mentioned parts entertained me, but barely. And WHOA, for those of you who have seen it, what did you think of the very end, with Chris Kattan? How could such a LOSER climax ever have been filmed?I warn you, fellow movie-lovers: this movie is a waste of time. It's an excuse for bored filmmakers to have tried to make money in Halloween of 1999, because they had no other project to bank on for the holiday. They probably wrote the thing in a couple hours. (I would say "a couple days," but then you REAL movie-lovers would say "Hey, 'Rocky' was written in a couple days!") A true consumer's movie, and therefore an insult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie's fun because it doesn't take itself seriously. And unlike many horror movies, it has some genuinely scary moments. Unfortunately, the movie loses it towards the end, which slightly detracts from the good stuff that came before it.I loved the bitchy exchanges between Price and Evelyn. The performances are all pretty good, given that there isn't much character development (not that there really should be, in this type of movie). Taye Diggs and Ali Larter are likeable leads and they have pretty good chemistry. The house is a character in itself, and it's very creepy and effective.One of the things that amused me about this movie is the characters' ability to use the F word in any situation. It takes a creative person to come up with, "that's enter-@#$!*&amp;#-tainment!" or "congratu-*&amp;^%#$&amp;-lations".</fullReview>

The original was a low budget film with only three well known actors and some casual special effects but the original had a good story behind it which made it work. In the end, only the villain(s) died and the audience was left with the question as to whether the house was really haunted by the dead or only exploited by the living.I didn't expect much from the remake and I wasn't disappointed. I watched the beginning which showed promise, and then fast forwarded through the gore, violence, sadism and four letter words to the end which summed up the entire flick--another tax write off for the studio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, it's as simple as this. No comparisons, don't know the original. It had some truly disturbing sequences - two in particular, which I'm sure anyone who's seen the film will know. The amusement park ride in the opening is worth the price of admission all on it's own.Mostly, it was fun, horror cheese. The people in the film are aware they're making horror cheese. They don't aspire to make anything else. The performances are universally appropriate and usually campy as all get out.The last 10 minutes detract from the film. I did appreciate the CGI effects mimicking ink blots, a nice touch in a film set in a mental institution.The directing was bang-on. He generated fear. The two sequences mentioned above are, to me, only rivaled by sequences in _Jacob's Ladder_ and _The Exorcist_. He didn't ask too much out of his actors - you could tell he let them run with it and have fun, especially Rush and Kattan. It was gruesome enough for horror fans to appreciate it, without being so gruesome it was unpleasant to watch. I hate unjustified gore, and this film, while quite gory, has an appropriate level.You're a horror fan, you'll probably enjoy it. You're not, you'll most likely hate it. I really enjoyed it on a late night viewing with a few beers in my belly. Would've got a slightly better rating from me if it weren't for the ending. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh how the film changed.It seems like the curse of the late 90's/early 21st century horror movie strikes again. Analyse the appeal of the horror movie: a good, strong atmosphere, combined with chills, and a bit of mystery... This movie scores zero in all three departments. Instead they seem to score highly for bad acting, absolutely HORRIFIC camera angles, a bad cast, and cheap special effects. I mean, this film is about as believable as Elvis recording a new record with Dr Dre.This is your typical haunted-house movie, but this time the guests will receive a million pounds if they manage to stay alive. The storyline is twisted, but certainly not in a good way. The rather cartoonish-style setting doesn't get high marks from me, the cast are braindead, they over-sell every emotion. Combined with `fake-scares', a Friday The 13th movie is more worthy than this third-rate 90's trash.Take the dialogue for example. What an inspired dialogue. The writers must have got bored and handed a pen and paper to a bunch of drunks. The script consists of lots of four letter words. Sad to see that bad language seems to have occurred more and more with films in the past five years. Let's hope in the future the dumb writers manage to inject a few real words into the script.The film may start off well, but ten minutes in, you start to realise this film throws character development out of the window and instead focusses on sex, blood, and gore. And not even the special effects are convincing, WHERE are those lights coming from?!!! It's a dark corridor, so where in the blue-hell is light coming from? Definitely not a torch, that. Even the pathetic ending hosts to some of the lamest CGI effects ever, which has murdered horror and sci-fi movies for the past ten years. Tell me, how convincing is it when a shape-shifter moves around at half the frame rate of the actual picture?The real killer is that the film is portrayed more of a comedy than a horror. The humour conquers the horror in every scene, which devours any chance of the audience being scared.2/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like so many remakes, House on Haunted Hill falls short of it's predecessor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love horror. Anything having to do with horror I will be fully committed to. That goes for books and movies. However, I am a fan of old horror movies. Mostly black and white ones that project that sense of what you don't see scares you more than what you do see, although there are some older horror movies in color that also project that sense. Movies like the original Haunting based on Shirley Jacksons "The Haunting of Hill House", the original House on Haunted Hill, The Innocents based on James Henry's "The Turn of the Screw", JAWS, PSYCHO, Rosemary's Baby, and The Exorcist. That is why when I saw the remake of House on Haunted Hill I was to say the least extremely dissapointed with it. I'm sure many would disagree with me on this view point since today's movie goers are more into the graphic violence that are in today's horror movies, which is fine since everyone has their own taste. Don't get me wrong I do like some of today's horror movies, but I like them for the cheap thrills and scares they give me, in all honesty though, they will never compare with older horror movies. When I watch older horror movies, whether they be in color or black and white and I just can't get to sleep at night after watching them I know that they have given me that sense of being scared of what I can't see rather than what I can see.Another thing I love about old horror movies that the remake of House on Haunted Hill did not provide is the music. In horror movies you have to time the music just right to get that creepy and erie feeling that makes a horror movie incredible and a classic. However, music doesn't always have to be used throughout a horror movie no matter how low it is toned down so it can be heard. Some of the best older horror movies have been those that do not constantly use erie and creepy music, but those that know when it is best to use it and when not to in it. With the remake of House on Haunted Hill even though it had scary music it had it throughout most of the film toning down the volume of it so it could barely be heard, but heard nonetheless.I am not one to force my opinion of what a good horror movie is and consists of, but in this case I would have to strongly recommend viewing horror movies that are actually good and leave you hesitating to leave your seat once the ending credits roll rather than ones that leave you disgusted with the gore, blood, and apparent violence in it. If you are a true fan of the horror genre than the appreciation of a truely terrifying horror movie should not go overlooked because of today's definition of a horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good horror movie. Madness, chaos good effects, cleaver writing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie. I gave it a 7/10. Might have got an 8 or 9 if they used Jeffery Combs in a bigger role. I like horror movies to be like a good trip to a haunted house. A great horror movie should make you feel like you are 10 years old and going to a carnival or Halloween haunted house. This does a pretty good job. I liked it better than the Haunting which was it's sister movie the same year. Notice how the blockbusters seem to come in pairs as if directors are competing to see who can make the best picture from the same subject matter. Like Armaggeddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak. The Messenger and Joan of Arc. The list goes on and on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, bad ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERTWell, what can one say about this film except that it showed bag loads of promise and then failed to deliver. The starting of the film showing the old days of the house was sufficiently dark and sick to scare the pants out of me and expect the same for the rest of the film, and for the most part i wasnt disappointed.The whole part with the girl with the video seeing the ghosts perform surgery followed sharply by a ghoul made me poo myself and when Geoffrey Rush gets put into the revolving machine and goes mad was also disturbing. But then we get to the end and it all goes bad. Geoffrey Rush has just come back from the dead and about to kill his wife when they bust into a secret room and a manifestation of evil appears quickly knocking off two of the guests. The bad thing is that a) it looks crap b) it isnt scary c) it seems to be there to rush to film to a conclusion So in conclusion watch this film, be scared and them wonder at its lameness.Oh yeah and keep watching to the end of the credits, theres a decent scary bit here too!</fullReview>

I don't remember anything from the movie because it was that lame. Vincent Price's version made in 1958 is a heck of a lot scarier than this one. Just because you jump doesn't make it scary, one that hold you in suspense through-out the film is a scary movie. Now, many may like this because it's a modernized version, but still you shouldn't remake a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The old mental patient hospital is rather good setting for a horror film and beginning of the film shows promise. Especially Geoffrey Rush as strange host of the event, plays an excellent role.However as with many horror films the plot is the weak point of the film. After rather chilly beginning the film gets lost in use of special effects and forgets what is actually scary. The end was however the biggest let down, without going into spoilers the end of the film was most un-satisfying and to just plain stupid (unimaginative) special effect show.I have not unfortunately seen the original (Vincent Price) film, so I cannot compare the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I don't write commentary on movies that already have a lot of comments, but I really feel that a lot of people missed the boat on a basically decent, scary movie. Well, either that or a lot of people are trying to look smart by shooting down horror, which is such an easy target that many film scholars don't consider it a legitimate genre.Anyway, as to why I gave this movie an 8, let's start with: I liked the characters. That's only my opinion, but each character *does* have a consistent and colorful personality, not to mention a capable actor. Geoffrey Rush, Peter Gallagher, and Chris Kattan in particular are wonderful to watch (although the whole cast does a good job). The plot isn't the tastiest ever, but it does include a goodly amount of backstory for the house - a former mental hospital - which sets up the atmosphere brilliantly. Nothing like dozens of angry, crazy ghosts running around to give you a good case of the heebie-jeebies! Even so, the movie cleverly keeps the supernatural in the background while the characters backbite each other, which is not only fun but suspenseful. Too bad they ended up dumping the intrigue for some poor special effects. The makeup and special effects used throughout the movie are pretty good - dunno what happened at the end.Even regarding the ending (which is awful), I can tell from listening to the commentary on the DVD that a lot of serious effort went into this movie, and it shows. Oh, there are continuity errors and plot holes, but nothing lethal. It's a horror movie, folks. Unless you've been transported into the theater in a sealed bag, you shouldn't be expecting "Citizen Kane." I liken this movie to a long episode of "Tales From The Crypt," with plenty of humor, gore, and treachery. House on Haunted Hill is a fun popcorn movie with a few thrills and chills, and it doesn't pretend to be anything more than that. Since when are movies required to be art?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capable, but not stellar, remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first thought as the credits rolled was "I didn't just see Geoffrey Rush's name go by, did I?" But yes, there he is in all his sadistic glory. Rush, who seems to have something of an affection for playing sadists, plays "Steven H. Price" (and he even grew a Vincent-esque mustache... beautiful!), reprising Vincent Price's Frederick Loren role in the 1958 original. Bond girl Famke Janssen is his long-suffering wife.If you haven't been in a cave since 1958, you know the drill: the seemingly evil and certainly creepy host offers a group of characters a million bucks apiece to spend the night in a supposedly haunted house... if they make it out alive. (cue swelling creepy music) Of course, the survivors will split the cash of anyone who doesn't make it, and oh, by the way, here are some things you can use to murder your fellow competitors. The twist this time: the house is a former asylum for the criminally insane, run by a doctor who should have been a patient (many-times-typecast Jeffrey Combs, the title character from Re-animator). This gives director William Malone the chance to do some wonderful things with vintage-looking atrocity footage that's truly creepy. The best parts of this movie are the all-too-brief shots of Combs and his ghostly comrades doing very nasty things, usually just off-camera, to poor innocent victims.And here's the weird thing. This is a capable adaptation of a film that really wasn't the best thing Vincent Price ever did. It's got some wonderful scenes, a cadre of talented young actors from the Oscar-winning Rush to rising star Taye Diggs to (do I need to say it?) teen heartthrob Ali Larter (Final Destination) who turn in good performances. So what's wrong with this picture? Why is it no better than the similarly-themed The Haunting, released only a month before? Well, okay, I won't go that far-- it's better than The Haunting ever dreamed of being, and with nowhere near as high-powered a cast. But still, all the elements here don't want to gel, and the effects-laden climax is... well, think The Haunting; the story gets lost in all the million spent on ghosties, ghoulies, and long-leggetie beasties. But it doesn't happen until very late in the film this time, at least.Oh, yeah, and it's got Max Perlich. He's only onscreen for a total of about forty-five seconds, but forty-five seconds of the thoroughly brilliant Perlich (Brody on Homicide: Life on the Street) is better than nothing. ** 1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Real Thrills In This "House"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's some genuine thrills, and a few chills thrown in for good measure, in this remake of the 1959 horror film, `House On Haunted Hill,' directed by William Malone. When Evelyn Stockard-Price (Famke Janssen) informs her husband, amusement park thrill-meister Steven H. Price (Geoffrey Rush), that she wants her birthday party to be held at an old house that stands on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean-- a house that was once an infamous mental institution in the ?30's-- he is more than willing to consent. What he plans, however, is more than she bargained for. He starts by shredding Evelyn's guest list and replacing it with his own, then decides to make it more than a party; it'll be a kind of a contest of endurance: Any guest who manages to stay the night and remain alive will receive a check-- at first light of morning-- for one million dollars. But his sinister plans are only the beginning of a birthday bash beyond anything even he could conjure up, because unbeknownst to Steven, supernatural forces (it would seem) are already at work on plans of their own. And before it's over, the Prices and their five guests (as well as the audience) will know a night of unimaginable terror. All of which sounds like the trailer from a camp ?50's horror movie, but as a matter of fact, this film is much better than that. Beginning with a well developed script by Dick Beebe, Malone puts his imagination to work and, with the help of some great special F/X, actually delivers the goods promised by all the promotional campaigns for the movie. The house itself is creepy, and the atmosphere Malone creates-- both physically and psychologically (`You don't want to go down to the basement!')-- makes for some truly frightening moments. From the outset, he keeps the tension high and maintains an air of mystery throughout as the story unfolds. Who is really doing what to whom, and are there really supernatural forces at work? There's enough twists and turns to keep everyone, including the audience, guessing as to what's actually going on; and just when you think you have it figured out, it twists again and you're back to square one. No matter where you go, there you are, and Malone is always still one step ahead. Oscar winner Rush lends an ambience of dignity to the role of Price (played by Vincent Price in the original), as does Janssen as Evelyn, their respective portrayals allowing each actor to demonstrate a versatility for not only leading roles, but character parts as well. As this is not a film that allows for much by way of character development, the characters must be established by the actors very quickly, and with at least enough depth to be credible, and in this Rush and Janssen succeed nicely. As the guests, Peter Gallagher turns in a notable performance as Dr. Donald Blackburn, as does Ali Larter, in the leading female role of Sara. The charismatic Bridgette Wilson adds significantly to the proceedings, while Chris Kattan (doing justice to the role created in the original by the terrific character actor Elisha Cook, Jr.) steals some scenes with his portrayal of the manic owner of the house, Watson Pritchett. Rounding out the supporting cast are Taye Diggs (Eddie Baker), Max Perlich (Schecter), Jeffrey Combs (Dr. Vannacutt) and Lisa Loeb in a noteworthy cameo as the Channel 3 Reporter. There's some scary moments in `House On Haunted Hill,' but nothing that will keep you awake or give you nightmares, because it's all done in a way that is meant to be entertaining, and most importantly, fun. Malone set out to make a movie that would provide some heart-pounding thrills and evoke some spontaneous screams from the audience, and that's exactly the movie he made; there's nothing here that's going to strike fear in the hearts of the meek. This is good old-fashioned Halloween or late-night fare that will make the hairs on the back of your neck bristle and perhaps make you want to leave the light on in the hall, so that in the morning you can have a good laugh at yourself over it. That's entertainment; and that's what the magic of the movies is all about. I rate this one 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such wonderful promise. Such a terrible payoff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Malone has made, in remaking William Castle's original "House on Haunted Hill," possibly one of the most spectacularly ambitious failures in the history of cinema - certainly in horror cinema. He has a cast that ranges from quite good to excellent, a setting that almost defies description in terms of cool, and even a decent storyline and premise.In fact, there is only the one problem with this film, and (though not spoiling anything) I will sum it up: the ending. Take it from me - as soon as Evelyn Stockard Price (Famke Janssen) responds to her husband Steven Price's (Geoffrey Rush) urgings to "Get up," turn off this film. You'll be much happier wondering just what happened than seeing what actually *does* happen.With that warning in mind, here is why disregarding that warning will bring nothing but disappointment. The premise of the film is that millionaire Steven Price throws a birthday party with a twist for his estranged wife, Evelyn. Shredding her list of guests, he writes one of his own, packed with people so hungry for money they'd kill for it. The problem is, when the guests show up at the "House on Haunted Hill" - the former Vannacutt Institute for the Criminally Insane - none of them are known to Steven or his wife.Along with Watson Pritchett (Chris Kattan, doing a marvellous job), who owns the house, the four guests find themselves trapped inside with the Prices when the "lockdown" mechanism from the house's days as an asylum is mysteriously activated. Pritchett's reaction to this is extreme - not surprising when you consider that the place had burnt out in the 1930s after the inmates revolted against Dr. Benjamin Vannacutt's inhuman practices and set the place on fire. Turns out that his father had been killed while restoring the house - when challenged over his statement that it had just been an accident, he memorably retorts "I lied. The house is alive. We're all going to die."This is a gorgeous set. There are two parts to the house - the restored levels above the ground and the unrestored basement. The restored sections enhance the American gothic style of the film, previously evoked in a beautiful re-imagining of the original opening sequence from William Castle's film. The unrestored sections are a nightmare of twisting corridors and disused medical equipment, and wheelchairs are to be found *everywhere* - for, it seems, no reason at all. Their presence is subtly ominous.Geoffrey Rush definitely steals the show in this film - his introductory sequence with Lisa Loeb and, happily, James Marsters, at the opening of the newest Price Amusements rollercoaster is wildly funny. He has a great chemistry, too, with Famke Janssen, especially in the scenes "lifted" from the William Castle original. Janssen shines herself, especially later on after a suprising revelation. As mentioned before, Chris Kattan is great, but the other four actors do very well with what they're given.The script is good when it comes to the Prices and Watson Pritchett, and adequate when dealing with the two "heroes" of the film, while the others are rather shortchanged - but not without reason. There's no real complaints apart from the extremely terrible ending. A final word about that ending: Should you sit through it, PLEASE stay and watch until the end of the credits. You will NOT be sorry. Even if you stop the tape or DVD and fast-forward to the end of the credits when Evelyn Price gets up, you'll enjoy it.Bottom line - see this film. It's really quite good, despite the ending, and you'll have a good time marvelling at the sets and enjoying Rush's, Janssen's and Kattan's performances.</fullReview>

Geoffrey Rush was horrible as the maniacal bored theme park owner Steven Price.If you wanna see a really good haunted house horror movie, see The Haunting (1963!!!). Now there's a movie to scare your pants off.This movie is only for those who don't mind to be mindlessly semi-entertained and who don't want to think about what they see.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main thing I liked about this movie was the atmosphere. Nicely demented, I must say, very sick in the head, but in an `evil-smile-on-my-face'-way. The violence and gore could have been a bit more graphic in my opinion, although there are a few scenes that would make an average moviefan's stomach turn six ways to Sunday. The house itself looks fantastic, not your average beautiful big Victorian haunted house, but a building that looks completely insane in it's own right. Outside it looks almost surreal, no man in his right mind would, or even could build a house like that. The mazes in the basement of the house have just the right eerie touch, anything could jump around any corner at any time. But unfortunatly, atmosphere does not make a movie great. The acting done here is not at all bad for a horror-flick (Holland's very own Famke portrais a fantastic total utter bitch again), but the story has a few untied ends that can't be denied. (WARNING: very mild spoiler) If someone says that (quote) 'The house changed the guestlist, by it's power', I would like to have a good explanation for that and not some 2 second chitchat about powerlines and the internet. (END OF SPOILER) The last 20 minutes or so rely to much on the basis 'haunted house'story and the plot is not very well rounded. I would have hoped for a more original twist at the end, because this ending relies to much on the FX-department, where the rest of the movie really doesn't. Atmosphere broken a bit at the end. But still, not bad at all. 7 outta 10.(Oh yeah, don't forget to sit out the credits, because there's a real cool short scene at the end! Not to be missed!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thankfully, we are not living in the horror movie sequels decade (aka the 80's). But now we are faced whith a new kind of horror, which englobes gore and satirycal humor. Now this movie, isn't a part of that "new wave" (see The Scream Trilogy for that) but it is included in the more generic music-video descendents. Like many movies these days, the action is "paused" for a musical break including "avant-gard" artistic expressions, and this movie has an excellent "action-pause" sequence. It also has some good quotes, though not coherently and certainly not during its entire length, excellent artistic direction and visual effects, and its cinematography matches its visual excellency. But the screenplay almost pushes this movie into commercial horror (see The Haunting - 1999), because of its undeveloped characters and the incarnation of evil chosen here.Sometimes, like in the initial sequence, it's "scary as hell", and can be considered very brave for a studio to pull out such a violent an gory movie, but disappointingly, in the rest, it's all too predictable, or even, not scary at all. Final comment: Great art mixed with somewhat ordinary gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American B-Grade Horror with Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an American Horror Film based on a movie I used to watch on Creature Features 20 years ago. You need to have a history with William Castle and his gimmicks to fully comprehend the Big bad scary carnival ride that it is. Those who enjoyed it, remember Doctor Demento and the camp-style films which ran on those type shows. The British have Hammer Films (and of course their success was that they played it seriously) This film is anything but serious -- it's fun, fun, fun, so don't go in looking for the meaning of life, not when we have over the top acting (thank you Famke for a beautiful job) Scene chewing (Chris, your Pritcher was extremely annoying, I loved him) and a swiss cheese script (who cares) I giggled and laughed and screamed and bought the movie (DVD is cool with lots more added scenes). The point is: When did we as a movie audience become so superior and sophisticated that we can't roll up our sleeves and have fun with a less-then-perfect motion picture. Every film is NOT THE English PATIENT or Maurice -- sometimes a cigar is just a cigar and sometimes a good time doesn't require everything to be picture perfect. Lastly my hat off to Mr. Rush and his wonderful interpretation of Mr. Vincent Price, also William Castle's daughter for wanting to bring the story back to life and the strange paradox that the original "Haunting" movie starring Julie Harris was a brilliant film while it's remake was God-awful and yet the original 'House on Haunted Hill' with Mr. Price was basement bottom (though I loved it and own it) and now nearly 40 years later it is the reverse. Haunting sucked, Hill was funky. Does anyone else find that strange?</fullReview>

Price (an homage to Price's work in the 1958 version of this film) is strikingly introduced as the multi-millionaire designer of a roller-coaster guaranteed to horrify its passengers to the point of insanity. The roller-coaster sequences--and especially the fiendish imagination behind them--are brilliantly conveyed.If only the filmmakers had sustained that early high level of imagination and horror, this could have been one of the best horror movies ever made.But then it quickly degenerated into cliche--a half-dozen or so people tempted to spend the night in the old mental hospital by the prospect of each receiving a million dollars. And of course, they were picked off one by one, for no convincing reason.The mayhem was very haphazard without being surprising. You never knew who--or what--was going to kill whom, but when they did, you weren't really convinced as to why they should want to do so. And so the whole plot got all flaccid and out of focus.One of the characters was trying to break into television production by video taping the goings-on. And she caught a scene from the institution's grisly past on tape. Now that's the kind of idea that should have been developed--bring in something supernatural and drive the participants insane--or to the point where they couldn't tell if they were insane or not--where they (and we along with them) couldn't know for sure if these crazy things were really happening, or if it was all an illusion created to horrify them, as was the roller-coaster.The filmmakers just never realized what potential they had for a cracking good horror tale.</fullReview>

How the screenplay writer/director in their pre-release interviews had the audacity to dub this as an 'involving black comedy laced with thick elements of scream out-loud horror' is simply beyond any comprehension. Inexcusably bad dialogue, plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon and some of the worst acting yet seen in contemporary cinema result to little more than a beaten-up, pathetic excuse for movie entertainment. If this movie were a horse, it would've been shot at birth.An absolute bag of washing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**********HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL**********The Plot: When an eccentric millionaire offer a group of opposites $1,000,000 to spend the night in a so called "Haunted House" with a murderous past, they figure it is a quick way to get quick money and leave. All of them are sure it is some made up story just to mess with their heads a little and test their courage. But, once they stay in the house they start to think about the mistake they made in coming there when mysterious things start to happen. House on Haunted Hill is has a very similar plot to The Haunting, it is a shame it couldn't come up with anything more original. 60%The Acting: The acting in House on Haunted Hill is rarely watchable. Come on! Geoffrey Rush did quality acting in Shine and Elizabeth, here he plays his part effortlessly and he is not believable at all. Ali Larter also did some great s**t in Final Destination, here is terrible! Famke Jenssen is the only person who is even close to putting on a memorable, chilling performance in this film. Again, I'll ask this. How could so much talent make such a poor film? 58%The Screenplay/Directing: Screenplay? Was there a screenplay for this film? If there was, I will be pleasantly surprised because the actors were so bad it looked like they were making it up themselves.. I will also be surprised if the director is from Earth, because no smart, college graduate director could of made this sloppy, slippy, slimy, stupid film. Shame on you. 28%Other: I have heard lots of about these `marvellous' effects. But, to be completely honest, they are far from marvellous. The ends visuals were laughable, and the cinematography was terrible. Nope. Your not going to get a good score for anything else, either. 49%Overall: House on Haunted Hill is an effortless try at a film. In my opinion, it is as bad as The Haunting, 199's other laughable attempt at a good haunted house flick. Stay away from this infectious germ of Bad Haunted House Flicks. It will give you nightmares forever... 26%**********HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL 26%**********</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is right up there with the films of the Vincent Price era and really good watch. Not too frightening with the added special effects which are enough to give you the creeps. Being set in an old asylum immediately gives it the setting to make you on edge for the rest of the film. No corny jump out, in your face happenings. It's just a good old fashioned horror and enjoyable to boot. the set design and scene setting keeps you thinking something very suddenand scary is about to happen. As a horror I would rate this 10/10 and will be adding it to my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House on Haunted Hill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid, the original version of this movie scared me tremendously. In fact, I thought it might be the ultimate haunted house film... right up there with the classic Universal films of the 30s and 40s. Seeing it years later though, it didn't hold up very well at all. In fact, the scares, special effects and dialog looked campy and even silly. Time reveals all.That being said, the new film is bound to fare even worse. To say that it is a bad remake is just to scratch the surface. Here are some of my main complaints: 1) The dialog is so stilted and full of unnecessary and repeated epithets and obscenities it sounds like an HBO "original". Throughout, you have the desire to see all these people chased out of the house and out of the film by a pack of hounds. 2) A haunted house movie should give you a good view of the house, shouldn't it? Well the few "exterior" shots that are used seem to be of a faceless monolithic structure high atop a mountain. There are no distinguishing characteristics or even a closeup. I thought it looked like a computer generated image from a Batman movie. 3) To follow the suspended disbelief and logic set up by the film: A house that is "alive" and so intelligent that it can connect online with a computer and alter a party guest list to invite whom it wishes, should be able to tell if those guests are the ones desired when they arrive... shouldn't it? I nominate the line "I was adopted!" as the stupidest line in a horror film ever. 4) The plot is not new, of course. But it has been done better by "The Haunting" and "The Haunting of Hill House" to name a "Make/Re-make" combo. This time, however, the cartoonish character portrayals are an albatross around the already feeble attempt at a story. This doesn't create the illusion of reality, suspense or even interest. 5) Blood. You like it? You want it? They have it here by the bucket and bathtubful. Do filmakers actually think this creates a good horror movie? I am certain that someone somewhere has measured audience shock response to the sight of blood and the number of time it is shown per minute and calculated down to the last drop how much to slosh across the screen to maximize box office attendance. For me, I was disgusted and angry after about 15 minutes. 6) Inconsistencies. All movies have some. This one is no exception, but these are too obvious to mention and pale in comparison to all the other problems.If you like slasher movies, this has the blood but not the payoff you want. If you like horror, this is a horrible move but doesn't really scare. If you just like good movies, find something else to rent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with average expectations, and left with an average view of it. There's a lot of questions left unanswered, and it doesn't look like there's much of a sequel there, at least with the same characters.To be honest with you, the first half of this movie is amazing....very atmospheric and genuinely scary...it sets a good scene for the second half of the movie. Unfortunately, the second half doesn't nearly deliver and it finishes very abruptly...in fact I skipped back a few scenes just to check I hadn't missed anything by mistake. A lot of questions about the house's past are left unexplained, and the relationship between Eddie and Sarah which seems to develop somewhat in the movie never concludes. It is like they took their time over the first half, and then realised how behind scheldule they were and rushed making the second half.Saying that, the visual and audio effects are both above average which kinda makes up for the average acting. It's just a shame that the storyline has so many holes...6/10P.S It's worth seeing just for the shots of Orlando, FL's Hulk rollercoaster at the beginning though :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, shabby mess. SPOILERS maybe, I don't care. Sorry but I'm upset and angry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film seemed at first to have a lot going for it, some good actors from a slightly more indie background than its bigger-budget sister flick, some inspired-looking FX in the trailer, a sound original and a genre, the haunted house movie, which seems an easy source of scares, but the final product is one of the most dismal efforts at a movie I have ever forced myself to sit through.Maybe I'm doing someone an injustice here, it did seem at times as if vast chunks of plot and characterisation had just been thrown out the window at a late stage of editing, but what comes across in the video version I saw is a hopeless, nearly incomprehensible mish-mash of no-effort storyline and no-charisma characters. It's almost as if someone's made a big old assumption about what people know about haunted house movies, and horror in general, and cut out anything that a sensible, aware viewer could deduce themselves from a hodge-podge of cliches. For example, as soon as you see a photo of a group of people from the old days along with the villain, you know (as do the characters) that everyone in the film is linked to those characters. This is just taken as read - the people in the scene make this leap of logic in an instant and don't feel any need to go into it further. This is symptomatic of the failing of this film - it's just lazy.They seem to think it's enough to make a poor, contrived and unconvincing excuse to get some random people in a house, make a half-arsed effort at creating some tension between some of them and then let the ghosts have a go at them. No-one in the film seems to have even one dimension, their personalities change to suit whatever scene is required of them, they have to keep shouting each others names cos the audience has no chance to get to know them and find out who's who, and the acting and dialogue try to out-awful each other throughout. Rush and Janssen are ridiculously over the top and have absolutely no chemistry between them to make their spiteful relationship work, the normally brilliant Peter Gallagher seems to be asleep most of the time and the rest are so bland you can only tell the difference between them because of the absurd tokenism of their "characters" - even the guy doing the "comedy scared bloke" routine soon blends in to the general mess of people running about trying to look scared and macho at the same time.The one thing this film could be said to have in its favour is some stylish, atmospheric scariness in the bowels of the asylum, the whole basement area was well-designed for maximum creepiness and some of the shuddering ghosties were really frightening. However, this effect was spoiled by frequent collapses of logic and continuity which lead to people wandering seemingly at random through the designated "scary areas" and occasional montages of "scary footage" thrown in with no clear reason or relation to the plot. I'm not even going to mention the whole "darkness" idiocy at the end; the final twenty minutes or so were a truly appalling climax of all the shoddy, ill-thought out aspects of the film, perhaps forming one of the most awful periods in terms of dialogue, effects and plot contrivance in the history of cinema. But, if you're a die-hard gore fan you could probably quite enjoy it, with the sound off and making sure you stop about half an hour before the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun, and occasionally scary horror romp that is flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts out seeming like a fairly typical yet fresh and modern scary flick that uses traditional methods of scaring people. As the film gets underway there are some genuinely freaky moments that are very well done and create a good atmosphere. In a similar way to "scream" it has you guessing at who is doing the killing, but your choices aren't just people!Like too many scary movies the film loses it edge, suspense and interest as it progresses and any fear that had been created disappears when the special effects arrive, because as 'The Blair Witch Project' proved; a good atmosphere is created by tension and subtlety, not special effects.Overall, this is a decent horror film that is well worth watching, but it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited in anticipation for the video of this to come out. Having already seen The Haunting and being sorely disappointed by that sad, un scary affair, I expected this flick to be a whole lot better.....WRONG!!!!!!! The First Act was very good. The theme park 'falling elevator' ride was soooo cool. The morbid history of the asylum was gruesome and violent and particularly evil. It effectively set the mood for the rest of this seemingly frightening flick.AHHM... WHAT HAPPENED??? The Second Act absolutely sucked! The house is 'alive'? A C.G.I.-created ghost? Errr... this is a carbon copy of The Haunting!!!This flick would have been more successful if the ridiculous ghost was never revealed, and the End Act had been radically changed. The End Act is so utterly dumb, it defies all your suspension of DIS-belief (which is required a LOT in this film).There is a feeling of script writer change-over at the halfway point (or maybe director change-over!) where this film takes a sudden nose-dive into a bucket of blood (hint, hint). Two thirds in, I began to get very bored and didn't care when characters started dying in numerous gory ways.CONCLUSION? Too many horror movie cliches and and suffering a severe lack of frights resulting in a boring flick which borrowed its ending from The Haunting! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing about a spooky house, Evelyn plans a party with a plan to murder her husband. The husband has other plans and makes his own guest list. . . but mysteriously that changes and five total strangers get invited with the estranged couple. Thus the party becomes a freak game show for a million dollars to each person who survives the night.Once the couple begin arguing as soon as characters are introduced, you know the rest of the movie will probably play out like some terribly made turkey. But the film does get a bonus for the interesting story revolving around the ghosts themselves and what actually happened in that house in 1931. Once "The Darkness" comes, basically everything is thrown out the window anyway. Your patience may not last that long too since the camera work plays out like STIGMATA (the dizzying and twisting can give you a headache pretty quick). For fans of the genre only. Or if you're bored and got nothing else better to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people have confused this movie with 'The Haunting' which came out in the UK around the same time. But don't make the same mistake as they are very different in quality. 'The House on Haunted Hill' is much the lesser film, having several aspects of it's under explained story line ripped from other horror films like 'Jacob's ladder' , 'Hell Raiser' and even 'Ghost'. The only originality coming from the 'amusement park' sequences early on. The film is also let down, and seemingly cut short, by and unimaginative ending. Of course the special effects are second to none but that's not saying much nowadays. The acting is adequate but the dialogue seems to contains a lot of unnecessary swearing sinking the film still lower and giving it an '18' rating.A time filler at best. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House on Haunted Hill vs. The Haunting in the battle of the remakes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI've recently been (un)fortunate enough to see both The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill, as well as their respective remakes.1999 was the year of the horror remake, it seems; a desperate, post-Scream grabbing at any worthwhile script from the past, before these lousy, fx-laden movies got blown out of the water by The Blair Witch Project.But what really worries me about inferior remakes is that they tend, by association, to expound the originals out of all perspective. Take The Haunting (5) - an average chiller that is quite adequate in giving a couple of psychological scares then goes away again. Certainly not the Citizen Kane of horror movies, yet having such a puerile remake has exaggerated its reputation.In many ways the '99 version (3) does things better. Seriously. Shaved off is the ponderous and over-explanatory prologue that weighed down the original. In fact, exposition was the flaw of much of the '63 vehicle, with Eleanor's overdubbed monologue train of thoughts distancing the viewer from the action. How can we become truly engrossed in a story where we have the power of telepathy?But what really grated in the original - Julie Harris' self-centred, victimised, weak and self-serving Eleanor - is reproduced here in the more likeable form of Lili Taylor. The rest of the characters are more appealing, too, with Liam Neeson's Doctor getting to do far more psychology than Richard Johnson in the original. This maintains the plot thread of a psychological experiment, rather than it being just a convenient device to get them in the house.Only Owen Wilson as Luke loses out, played by Russ Tamblyn in the original as the man-about-town checking his inheritance. Here he's just another patient, though this at least makes it less obvious as to whom the ghosts are centred on.Catherine Zeta-Jones' character is odd, too, a brash American with only a trace of the Welsh Vallies, she plays a libidinous bisexual with a sleeping disorder and a penchant for walking around in her bra. But whereas this may lead you to believe you'll see Catherine doing the wild thing with some nubile beauty, nothing of the sort happens. In fact, such a character trait has neither relevance nor depth, making it more of a catchall titillation rather than any great reworking of Claire Bloom's character. This Theodora, though, is noticeably more sisterly, less bitchy towards Eleanor than she was in the original. (It should be noted, however, that the novel on which both films are based - Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House" - does describe Theodora as a lesbian).House on Haunted Hill (1958, 6) is probably a better bet both times, a one-joke horror send-up that relies on gimmickry to tell a decent tale. The remake, however, while better than The Haunting's '99 incarnation, still lacks the charm of it's precursor.Here Geoffrey Rush is cast as the Frederick Loren character, renamed to Steven Price in honour of Vincent who played the role in the original. There's even an intended, and distinct, visual likeness, though why go to the trouble to pay homage when the movie bares almost no similarity?A constant stream of foul-mouthed language, crude sexual references and excessive gore punctuate this picture. Don't mistake me - I'm all for constant nudity, swearing and blood - but only when it's necessary. This film opens out with a back-story for the haunted mansion (in the original it was just trickery, this reworking adds a genuine supernatural element), where a Dr. Vannacutt is experimenting on psychiatric patients. The patients revolt, sticking pencils right the way through his neck, with requisite buckets of blood, while all three nurses are murdered, but not before they have their breasts forcibly exposed. Pretty pathetic all round.When it returns to the present day, we find, as with the original, that five people are invited to spend a night in the mansion. If they survive the night then they will each get $10,000/$1,000,000 dollars (depending on the version). The group in the 90s movie consist of Ali Larter (by-the-numbers "frightened" act); Taye Diggs (token black man, ex-baseball player, who gets to do all the physical requirements); Chris Kattan (lame comedy element); Peter Gallagher (he'll never be Jeff Goldblum and he knows it) and Bridgette Wilson (spare part). What the group have to contend with are silly underdeveloped "scares", buckets of blood, whirring heads (a direct rip-off from Jacob's Ladder), product placement for Blockbuster Video and Marilyn Manson.The conclusion is where it and 99's The Haunting dovetail - both feature completely unconvincing CGI endings, where the houses come to life and attack the residents. The Haunting is definitely the worst, with its giant grabbing hands from doors, statues that come to life and walls that have eyes. Haunted Hill, in turn, merely has a gigantic swirl of inky ghosts that look like a smoker's cough. Hill scores by virtue of the fact that - as well as being simply the better film - it's source didn't take itself so seriously. A dumbed-down, gored-up, fx-spoilt version of a daft William Castle film isn't as big a heresy as laying on the tacky trimmings to Robert Wise's po-faced original. For Haunted Hill '99, then, it's a "4" - and keep watching after the end credits for a bonus sequence of garbage.Four horror films, none of them particularly that good, and one of them a stinker. And, be warned - apart from scant moments of the original Haunting, none of them, not even Castle's clever '58 offering - are actually scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very impressed with "House On Haunted Hill" because it was a scary movie that even got me a few times. Not many horror films recently have been "scary"; however, this is different. What really sets this apart from any other horror films I've seen recently was the cast because they all seemed to work well together. Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen, Chris Kattan,Taye Diggs, Ali Larter, Peter Gallagher and Bridgette Wilson come together to create a sense of believability to the movie that may not be there if other actors took the roles.This is a brilliant script that called for a lot of good performances from everyone, which was accomplished. Everyone had to depend on one another for survival; however, there were several brilliant twists. The first having two guests in cahoots to gain five million dollars and the other having only two people surviving the night. Both made for an excellent movie.Though "House on Haunted Hill" was impressive it was not the best horror film I've seen because with the amount of special effects there was, they did not scare me as much as I thought. Still, they were original and believable. All in all I was impressed with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill had SOOO much potential. The first 10-20 minutes were really snappy! But as soon as the characters arrive at the house, the movie starts to spin out into a familiar pattern present in many many other horror movies. Before the scary stuff starts happening, we go on a tour of the house with the characters. The foreshadowing during this "tour" is so thick you could cut it with a spoon. They could have cut out the middleman (no pun intended) and said "This person will meet a grisly end in this room and that person will be driven into frothing insanity in that room." But then we wouldn't have a movie, would we? =] Despite being bludgeoned about the face and neck w/ foreshadowing, I did get the crap scared outta me. I doubt I'd want to see it again, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill has it's ups and downs. Probably more downs than ups. The beginning was chaotic and strange. The gore at some parts of the movie turned me off. I don't have a problem with gore, it's just the way it's portrayed. There are some elements of the movie that I do like, for instance I like the scenes that are just weird and creepy that get under your skin (ex. the scene where a dead doctor is scene in a security moniter walking and moving jerkily (due to frames taken out of the footage) and acting very bizzare. I also like a few of the one-liners, which were fairly funny (two of them, mainly). I watched this movie with a friend, and I mentioned that in haunted house movies like this, if the characters would just stay in the main room and relax until morning, opposed to exploring the farthest, darkest corners of the house, they might just survive the night. Movies like this have a basic formula: take a handful of characters without much knowledge of them, throw them in one general area for the whole film, and have them run around scared and trapped while things jump out and go "boo!" The history of the house being an insane asylum was kind of cool, though, but I don't know any insane asylum where the doctors cut open patients while they are still awake and can feel pain (a scene I don't particulary like, I don't enjoy seeing people suffer on screen) This movie might of been better if it would have stuck to being sublte. And I don't find CGI ghosts the least bit scary.</fullReview>

Geoffrey Rush is fantastic as Mr Price - theme park entrepreneur- who invites a select group of people to the house on Haunted Hill for his wife's birthday - but, was it really him who invited them? Naturally there are a few grizzly deaths, a number of surprises, a likeable hero &amp; heroine and a detestable villain. The special effects fitted in nicely with the design of the film, it was more subdued than the whizz-bang effects in The Haunting- and this seemed to work in the films advantage. It seemed a little more realistic than most films of this genre, especially considering that what you are really watching is a haunted house story. I thought this was very entertaining, certainly not to be taken seriously, with some great comic one liners. Still those not a fan of horror should stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh why, oh why did they add the Hollywood CGI Shadow?!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I can tell you something about this movie...It was a cold day when this movie came out in my country and I remember seeing the trailer for it. SInce I'm a total film buff, I simply had to watch this movie. So I decided to call up my friend and go watch it in the theaters.First I was suprised that the age limit of the movie in my country was +16, so I had little hopes for it to be gory or for that matter scary.(Blade was 18 here! And it even wasn't that scary or gory!) Well, I went into the theater with little hopes and when the titles rolled was happily surprised about its tone. I've always been very particular about horror movies lately because they have all conformed to the usual Slasher genre, where a bunch of kids get diced and the killer appears at the end. Very rarely a true horror movie is made. So I was delighted at the first minutes when I saw the grim history of the mental asylum! I knew then and there that this was going to be a true horror movie!The characters were somewhat weak except for Geoffrey Rush who I like as an actor anyway, but they sufficed for their roles. The story was cliched but good, giving that old Hammer film feel to it. A bunch of people are invited to a haunted house to spend the night. Seems easy enough, however it will be harder to stay alive then they expected. What I really like in the movie was the ambient noise that was constantly heard throughout the movie, that scared me almost subliminally. Within the noises there were often screetches or screams, whips and what not that gave the feeling that the house was truly a disturbing place. I also like the dirty grimy feeling of the lower levels of the house as well, with strewn wheel chairs on the corners, and green walls, giving a truly scary surrounding.The first 45 minutes of the movie I was absolutely delighted! I was truly scared in fact in a few scenes that almost gave me and my friend a heart attack! After the first scare I told my friend, "I don't think I can live through another one of them!" Fortunately I did, but I don't know about the kids next to me. After the film my right ear was aching from the constant howling from 5, under 13 year old, girls who managed to get into the theater and unfortunately see the film next to me. I liked the way the ghost moved as well, making them totally unnatural and scary to watch! Even though they walk, its scary, and being a film buff and seeing LOTS of horror films, that is an achievement if they can scare people when they see things walking!I was really getting frightened after the 45 minutes, hoping that I can survive the rest of the movie and having the constant thought in my head that if these normal ghosts were this scary, wonder how scary the shadow is.However when you do get to see what the Shadow is, thats when the movie takes a 90 degree nose dive. Oh why, oh why did they add the Hollywood CGI Shadow?!! My buddy and I have a theory that the producers had to level down the scare factor of the film, or people would have complained about heart palpatations! However I think that the urge to add the hollywood factor in the film was too great to resist and they added the CGI into it. The shadows was absolutely NOT SCARY! In fact it was pleasent to look at, more like a floating tattoo you'd see on a persons arm. But totaly not scary. And it seems that the story took a dive aswell at the end too. You'll see what I mean if you watch it. If they would have only continued in the fashion that they started the film would have been a really killer film! Unfortunately they added the CGI and almost completely ruined the film.I give this film a **out of*****, purely because of the shadow, it simply ruined it. I felt almost empty when I left the theater. Totally unsatisfied. However I do believe you should watch this movie purely for the first 45 mins, because its totally worth it, the rest you can skip, but the first 45 mins are mind blowing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy, uneven, fun but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gore-splattered and at times genuinely creepy remake of the 1958 William Castle film, spoiled by a truly lame ending. A millionaire amusement park mogul invites a group of people to a haunted mansion for his wife's birthday and offers $10,000 to anyone who can stay the whole night. When they arrive he discovers none of them are people he actually invited and one by one they get picked off, both by residual evil forces and each other. The opening five minutes are among the bloodiest in modern cinema as the inmates of an asylum go on a rampage of slaughter and rape; after that the film goes down hill faster than the trick elevator ride in the following sequence. `House on Haunted Hill' suffers from a dearth of character development outside of Geoffrey Rush's wonderfully hammy sadistic funpark owner, a subplot which fails utterly and, ultimately, one of the most disappointing climaxes ever devised. Fortunately, there are a few good scares along the way and nobody seems to be taking anything too seriously, particularly Rush, whose impersonation of Vincent Price is brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill was a movie that had great potential for a while. At the same time, it was very weak in many areas. Allow me to explain my reasoning.As I have read that someone else said, the movie did not identify the characters more than their names and what they do, thereby not giving us any clue as to what they were like besides Steven Price, the fraudy horror dude, and his wife Evelyn, the snob. All other characters were totally undefined, and before you know it, someone was dead and it left you uncaring because when watching a movie, you have to get acquainted with the characters so that you can say "Oh good, he deserved to die" or "No! My favorite character is dead!" Otherwise, there's no real effect to it.There were also many inconsistencies in the whole plot. Like first of all, whose idea was it to put an insane asylum teetering over the edge of a cliff with nothing but water at the bottom? And secondly, why were the doctors at the asylum so brutal with their patients? "Oh yeah, lets use this rusty old scalpal to slice open a patient without any anesthesia for no apparant reason." Not to mention the fact that the people who were gathered together went down into the basement/torture chambers several times even though they knew that people were dying. Maybe it's just me, but wouldn't you rather stay bunched together in the main room in front of a nice, warm fire all night, rather than dying in a dusty old asylum? I mean, really, come on people. Besides, how did the guest list "miraculously" change anyway? The computer it was typed on wasn't even near the house that was haunted, so how did it change by itself?Aside from the bad, the movie started off great, and was really good pretty much until the midpoint. There were so many twists in the plot where you think this person's dead but really they killed other people and so forth. But for a while there, really only one person died because of the house and the things that happened before she died were scary enough to make your body tense. There were some really bizare scenes as well, that kind of seemed like they belonged more in a Marilyn Manson video, such as that whole dream sequence when Steven is in that picture room. But I think it made the movie more entertaining because bizare is good.Towards the middle of the movie, the whole haunted part of the house changed. It was MUCH scarier when there was a dead doctor running around ripping people's faces off and dismembering their bodies then when some shadowy thing turns someone into a pile of dust instantaneously. I would've rather watched the former. There's nothing scary about a shadow, I'm sorry. The ending was weak as well; how DID they get off of the cliff? And why couldn't the checks have at least blown away? And who slipped the checks through the sealed window anyway? In my opinion, it would've been a lot better had it have ended with the last two survivors plummeting to their doom, which presents irony because it wasn't the house that killed them. Or it could have ended somewhere outside and away from the house, showing what happened afterwards, possibly leaving room for a sequel or even just a scary ending.So, in conclusion, I think this movie deserves 2 out of 4 stars just for the sake of the first half being very intriguing and suspenseful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched this movie I found myself, right from the beginning, inclined to close my eyes. The gore was disgusting and revolting. Prichett was a bit funny, he slightly lightened my green face. But as the film went on, I never laughed or even smiled a LITTLE. (I think I deserve 1 million dollars for surviving the night.) As character after character went down into the basement my nail-biting questions changed from "what's that shadow in that doorway?" to "when am I going to be able to open my eyes and avoid seeing somebody's leg, minus the rest of the body, fly across the screen?"The language was really bad. I've seen, or rather heard, worse, but the ef-word came up so often (about once every two seconds) that I almost closed my ears as well. You see now that I would have rather not had anything to do with this TERRIBLE movie. My family and I couldn't have hated this film more. I am warning you before you go down into the basement. If you see this film you will SERIOUSLY regret it. Words cannot illustrate how BAD this movie was. My rating is, quite simply, 0.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the bad news. They put 10-20 previous horror movies in a blender, whipped them all up and poured out -- a bunch of scenes that look like they came out of a blender set on low. No continuity in sight. The place is restored, it isn't. They spent a zillion dollars restoring it but didn't do the driveway. It's all fixed up except for the basement, which seems to be where each and every function of the old hospital was, including the mad doctor's office. What did they use the other 30 stories for? Who knows. They really don't exist as the attic is a single flight of stairs up from the main floor, in easy shouting distance.The good news -- it will scare the crap out of you! They don't get much more genuinely terrifying than this one.</fullReview>

Taye Diggs was good, so was Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen. The sliminess of many of the characters made you less caring though and the ending was a bit of a disappointment. When I saw this movie at the cinema, I had my feet under the chair in front and felt something touch them, I thought it was someone in front, but when I looked over there was no-one there. That was how much this film affected me. It is tense, unnerving, horrifying and very very frightening. If you are not of a nervous disposition, go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Earlier this yr the Haunting came out and it was PG 13. That says enough about how scary it actually was. Well, The House on Haunted Hill is a lot better. There actually is blood in this movie. The plot is cool and the intros to both the Mr. Price in his amusement park and to the guests as they arrive in limos are all fantastic. It's all part of some terrific setup and is played with frightening music. So they get to the house and it's often kind of scary. It messes with your mind. Until the three quarter mark. The final act, if you will. I guess this is a spoiler, but for those who have seen it, that cloud chasing them around the house was so stupid. How do you end a movie that had the potential to be scary with a computerized effect of something that doesn't even exist? The movie is good up until the end at which point it falls apart. At least it had some scary moments and the coolest setup in a long time.</fullReview>

But then comes the DARKNESS, which is a cool idea but CGI, come on, I hate when CGI ruines a movie, like when it was overdone in THE HAUNTING, which was good but overdid the CGI. Then the ending was a bit of a letdown but dont get me wrong, I still liked it but they should have used something spookier, CGI sucks, STAR WARS EP. 1 had great effects, anyway, its worth seeing but the ending is a bit of a letdown.

		<fullReview>If you're looking for thrills and gore,this is the movie for you.If you want plot,characters and real suspense,I suggest you look somewhere else.As far as dialogue,this movie contains the most empty,confusing script I've heard.The plot is that a rich guy and his wife invite guests and offer them a million dollars under the pretense that they stay the whole night.But the people that come aren't who was invited.(SPOILER)Everyone ends up staying the night,but not all stay alive.The story gets more confusing as the camera takes you through dark,twisting hallways.You can't help but yell at the characters for their amazing ability to split up and get themselves killed,either by humans or the house.The house,which was a psychiactric hospital in the 1930's had a grizzly past.There was a doctor who performed horrible experiments on patients,such as in the opening scene,where he's operating on a conscious patient.Well,the patients finally get sick of it and attack.Before the doctor is killed,he throws the switch that turns the entire house into an iron prison.Five people survive.It is said that the house itself is haunted.The gore is plentiful as you'll see.Severed heads,limbs, the whole deal,including a guy who's face is carved out like a thanksgiving turkey.As for the psychological elements,there isn't much.The one part that truly creeped me out was when they showed the ghost doctor walking around like he had something shoved up his butt.(I know,it doesn't sound scary,but watch it at night)I say for something truly more intriguing,The Haunting does a much better job.</fullReview>

It has the usual loose characters of a horror film and although it starts well, the writers soon got bogged down in twists and hum-drum chases.Unfortunately there is very little to recommend about this travesty unless you enjoy to watch the stars wander off individually for no apparent reason to their doom and the use of slashed up bodies to little effect.In the end I would be surprised if you even cared about any of the characters and the ridiculous ending only serves to highlight the badness: sitting here now I can hardly remember any stand out scenes or even exciting action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original House on Haunted Hill(1958) works. The film centers on the conflict between Frederick and Annabelle Loren(Vincent Price and Carol Ohmart) and toys with the audience as to the existence of actual ghosts in the title setting or perhaps just the presence of a clever rouse put on by a mastermind bent on the death of his wife. For all of its simplicity, it proves to be a unique psychological drama, much more mysterious and entertaining than other films that fall into the same genre. The 1999 remake starts on much the same note. Geoffrey Rush is particularly good as the somewhat eccentric Stephen Price and although Rush intends to immortalize the original film's director, William Castle, we are nonetheless left with a tribute to the character's namesake. As far as the rest of the cast goes, the acting is tolerable...but let us not condemn the film just yet. Once the principle characters arrive at the house, now a semi-abandoned lunatic asylum, the story initially takes hold of the viewer and refuses to let go. Even with the original in mind, I find myself guessing and reguessing as to who is truly playing who and what actually is occurring off camera between the various characters, all of which potentially have hidden agendas. However, as the film comes to a close(SPOILERS AHEAD), I also find myself half-expecting the Price character to emerge, after his "death," and explain how the whole thing was some elaborate hoax. This, of course, would have been along the lines of the 1958 version and also would have justified a great number of out-of-character moments that occur near the film's end. Yet, the film makers here decide to take a different approach. It seems there actually are ghouls present in the house and they finally emerge to claim the living for their own. Ok, I can accept this interpretation...save that the "darkness" that lives in the house is a cg effect and that the film reduces itself to a less-than-exciting, overly-simplistic chase sequence: the surviving characters frantically running from, all things being considered, a cheap cartoon. And hence the film falls apart. If you are looking for the thinking man's horror picture, look elsewhere. However, if you simply wish to witness some above-average effects and occasional genuine scares, see House on Haunted Hill by all means. Just don't expect to have nightmares unless computer graphics frighten you to the nth degree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1999 version of "House on Haunted Hill" is a case of the filmmakers being so insecure about the story they're trying to tell that they throw absolutely EVERYTHING into it that they can find. On a superficial level, this movie is a remake of William Castle's 1958 Vincent Price vehicle of the same name. Now if you've seen the original film, you know that it has a plot that is already weird and almost entirely implausible: a millionaire and his wife throw a party at a haunted mansion and invite a group of strangers who are told they will receive $10,000 if they stay until morning. Even though Castle's film is based on this wacky premise, it at least has its own dreamlike inner-logic. It sets the rules early on, and sticks to them, thereby making the ridiculous plot palatable (and even entertaining). Screenwriter Dick Bebe and director William Malone apparantly didn't think that basic premise was enough for a new millenium audience, however, and they pile on as many extra elements as they can think up: sadistic torture, actual supernatural events, psychadelic flip outs,bad rock music, mistaken identities, and so many plot twists the movie ends up like a box of broken pretzels. In other words, "House" 99 makes even less sense than the original. And it is 100 times less entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lame remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"House on Haunted Hill," though surely no worse than 1999's remake of "The Haunting," is, also, distressingly not much better. Itself a redux of a 1959 Vincent Price film, this modernization goes the usual route of adding buckets of blood and gore in a vain attempt to "update" material that is better left in its original form.The film actually holds some promise in its early stages. Geoffrey Rush, in a marvelous display of scenery-chewing grandeur, stars as a thoroughly daft amusement park designer who decides to invite a group of people to his wife's birthday bash to be held at an old, abandoned insane asylum (a plot detail, by the way, that renders the film's title meaningless) that once functioned as the torture chamber for a mad scientist turned mass butcher. Of course, Rush has promised to give $1 million to whoever manages to survive the night. Unfortunately, though, once the cadre of handpicked nitwits is gathered within the secured confines of the haunted building, the film takes a decided turn downhill, settling into a standard slasher/haunted house film format replete with overwrought special effects, a limitless supply of gore and carnage, and endless shots of characters roaming along dark, flashlight-illuminated corridors, just waiting to be picked off one by one.Despite the occasional nifty plot twist, the offbeat humor that informs the earlier sections of the film begins to drain away as Rush himself becomes more victim than prankster. That is a true shame because none of the other characters, with the possible exception of Rush's equally macabre and eccentric wife, evokes the slightest degree of interest or empathy from the audience. By the time heads are rolling and the house is methodically tracking each one down to be its next victim, we are ready to take the money and run ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HOUSE ON NOT SO HAUNTED HILL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood 90s unoriginality at its most blatant. Not content with being a remake of a 50s spooky thriller, this was also in production when DreamWorks were making.... oh, could that be a remake of a 60s spooky thriller?Never mind, we all think, it can't be any worse than Jan de Bont's lame version of "The Haunting".Well, actually it can.Unfortunately it now officially looks like seeing nubile teenagers walking down darkened corridors, flashlight in hand, is no longer interesting.Especially when they're such underdeveloped and anonymously played characters as these.For a while at the start, when husband and wife team Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen bitch royally at each other, it almost threatens to become more interesting than it is, but like most things in this tale of various strangers offered $1 million to spend the night in the eponymous location and make it out alive, it's just not followed through.Kind of difficult to get scared by what appears to be a bunch of iron filings as well.You've got to wonder about a scary movie when the opening credits and Marilyn Manson's cover of the Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams" are the best things in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's no surprise that this remake of the 1958 schlocker fatally overdoses on bloody body parts and CGI effects. What's disappointing is how completely it wastes an almost A-list cast. While Taye Diggs and Peter Gallagher wander around looking for something, anything to do - Geoffrey Rush (taking on the Vincent Price role as the diabolical host) devours scenery with little apparent relish. Price had more fun four decades ago. So did the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good! ***Contains Lots of Spoilers!***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was the best horror movie I have ever seen in my life. I am very hard to get scared (trust me), but this movie did it! When watching, not only does the movie scare you, but so does the music. If you haven't already, buy the soundtrack! It contains great music and chilling sound effects in it.The opening sequence of the psychiatric Asylum was very freaky seen in thx, from the incision in the guys stomach to people drowning in tubs of water. It was scary from thinking that this probably actually happened in some places. People like Dr. Vannacut experimenting on retarded people. From then on the chill factor kept going up.The roller coaster clip was hilarious and made me nervous through out it. When entering the house for the first time I recognized Melissa from other films (like Billy Madison for instance). Just looking at the house's presense made me know something wrong just might happen.All sorts of things happen from Melissa seeing Dr. Vannacut on Videotape only and the machine that makes you sane if your insane and vice versa, and the "evil" of the house running around trying to suck the souls from the last survivors. The only negative thing that I see in the movie was the ending, which made me laugh at how pointless it was.Overall, this film was one of the best........actually THE best film I have ever seen. Hope you liked it too! 10 out of 10One more thing. Make sure you watch after the credits for a little clip of what "actually" happened back in the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW - Let me explain...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are quite a lot of mixed reviews here, and I'm afraid potential viewers may be confused by them. Let me try to clear this up.The ones that didn't enjoy it just didn't seem to get the point. While this film certainly has its cheesy moments, it's clearly intended as a throwback to those horror films of old, particularly the one by the same name that it's meant to remake. Geoffrey Rush does a great job as the Vincent Price character, for instance, as no one else could.That having been said, WOW - what a great film! I'm a fan of horror movies, new and old, but most are very disappointing and/or predictable. This one had me not only scared, but actually almost uneasy at some points. There are some really excellent moments in the film. While the plot isn't terribly intricate, it's got a few twists and turns to keep you guessing.Although I agree that the very end is a bit of a let down, I think that's just emphasized in large part by the quality of the previous 95% of this film. I strongly recommend this to any fan of the genre, particularly those interested in older Vincent Price era films. This film pays a very respectable tribute to them, and you won't be disappointed.If you just like a scare, you'll enjoy it for that, too. There are some good ones, with plenty of tension in between. It starts right out of the gate, and doesn't let up much, if at all. While you won't be disappointed, if that's all you're looking for, you'll be missing some of those other, more subtle qualities which really make this film great.It's like a roller coaster ride that lasts for an hour and a half. Speaking of which, don't miss those scenes - some of the most innovative I've seen. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good until the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is perhaps an example of exactly how even the most promising premise and execution can be let down by the current mania for the latest technology. I am not one to deride the latest release as "Hollywood rubbish," but in this case what ought to have been a classic example of American Gothic filmmaking is ultimately ruined by the use of cheesy CGI technology - when in fact it was completely unnecessary.The basic premise of the film concerns the birthday party of one Evelyn Stockard Price, estranged wife of horror-theme-park maestro Stephen Price (named in honour of Vincent Price, who starred in the original film). Price invites five people "so hungry for money they'll do anything" to the recently-restored Vannacutt Institute for the Criminally Insane, an asylum that was destroyed in 1931 in a fire which killed the inmates and all but five of the staff.The trouble is, the people who show up are *not* the ones Price invited, although the real reason for their being there is revealed later. Nevertheless, the Prices continue with the party - at least until an old lockdown mechanism from the asylum traps them inside for the night.This film is gorgeously photographed. The eerie visuals in the unrestored basement level provide some real chills on first viewing, and brilliant use is made of flash-and-it's-gone imagery at exactly the right moments. Highlights include the view through a camcorder which is *very* different from what the naked eye can see, and the scene in a "saturation tank."Everyone does very well with their roles, but Geoffrey Rush (Stephen Price), Famke Janssen (Evelyn Price), and Chris Kattan (Watson Pritchett) shine. Kattan provides one of the best lines in the film shortly after the lockdown.Unfortunately, the film begins to lose direction as it explores the twisted nature of the Prices' relationship towards the end, and the sudden return of the supernatural element is spoiled by its pathetic computer-generated nature. Truly, the directorial choices in the last fifteen minutes of the film leave a lot to be desired - some really good ideas are used as mere throwaways (such as the appearance of Vannacutt himself on a closed-circuit monitor) when they should have been utilised as part of the main story.If you can stomach the awful climax, stick around until the end of the credits. It's well worth it, and almost redeems the film. It *is* a film worth seeing, but prepare to be disappointed in the knowledge of how good this *could* have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie until the last quarter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are into genuinely scary movies, go see House on Haunted Hill right now. Don't wait for the video, find it in a theatre somewhere. This movie is the first that has scared me since The People under the Stairs, and I was 8 at that time. The atmosphere is incredible, you will truly feel trapped in this house with these people. The stunning combination of camera work, music, and scenery will quickly unravel the steadiest of nerves. Though the story is somewhat silly, the movie isn't really about all that. Its just there to scare the hell out of you like you thought no movie could do.There is one important thing. If you want to leave liking the movie, leave the second the "Darkness" shows up, its completely downhill from there. The cheesy "monster" character takes a well-built thriller and ruins it. The director needed to learn a few lessons from Hitchcock before he made this movie. As is, its great for a scare, but the ending will leave you either laughing at the cheesiness of the final scene, or furious at seeing such a potentially great movie ruined by the demand for special effects. If you've seen "The Long Kiss Goodnight", you'll understand what I mean. 8 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a few years since I saw a really decent horror film and I'm sad to say that House on Haunted Hill did absolutely nothing to change that.......at all. The original was great for it's time and I must admit that the opening scenes of this remake with all the loonies taking over the asylum and wreaking havoc set the scene nicely but the rest of the film fails to live up to expectations and to be honest I found the movie had a certain contempt for it's audience that I frankly found insulting.It was unbelievable that no one thought of looking upstairs for a way out of the house until the last 10 minutes, the majority of the movie being spent in the basement. The characters are totally flat and you really don't give a rats arse who dies or how and again the ways in which the characters are bumped off are, if not predictable then totally "seen it all before" kind of stuff.The dialogue is ludicrous and actors attempts to ham it up fall flat. As you can guess I didn't like this film at all and the fact that the only way I could get my GF to see it was to pay for her to get in (she either didn't want to waste her money or knew what was coming) added to my dissapointment. It wasn't scary at all although my GF jumped in a few places. The effects were ok but the "Token" monster at the end was cliche and stupid and if it hadn't done so already then basically it really fell apart at the end. Unless you're desperate to fill 2 hours of your life with something, anything, then I wouldn't bother with Haunted Hill at all. I thought the Haunting was a lot better and that wasn't brilliant. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar to "The Haunting" but better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**May contain spoilers**Ever since House On Haunted Hill hit US cinemas in October '99 I wanted to see it. Unfortunately I had to wait 4 months before it arrived in England.The storyline is similar to Jan De Bont's "The Haunting" but even though the special FX in that was very good,the general creepiness of the house wasn't believable. "House..." is definately more eerie. When watching, my friend and I both commented on how it resembled a Playstation game known as Silent Hill. This film shows what a haunted house should really be like. However the ending was a bit of a letdown. You would've thought that even though the remaining characters made it out alive, you feel that they shouldn't be laughing as there is nothing to laugh about the ordeal that they have just gone through. Yet despite this critiscm this is one film I'll be getting on DVD in April. If "The Haunting" put you off this type of genre, "House On Haunted Hill" will attempt to bring you back to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie today with a friend..13/2/2000. It started off not all that bad. The theme park was really cool by the way. But once they arrived at the house, I was getting..How could you say, 'Very Scared'. This movie generally freaks you out something chronic. It makes Blair Witch Porject look like a childs movie.I though it was really clever special effects. Plus good.Though I still believe that a movie is only made out to be scary and horrifying by the sounds. And with this movie, the sounds were pumped up soo much, that it made you feel that you were a part of the film.The movie i believe is designed to make you think and guess in many parts. Which is what I like in a movie. The story itself was pretty good. Plus, the music in it...It really suited the type of movie. Freakishly soul style.All in all, my verdict : 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all....I liked it. Even though there has not been any talk of a sequel to the new movie "House on Haunted Hill", the audience should prepare themselves that in the year 2015, you may be attending the local theater to see "House on Haunted Hill #15...Revenge of the Remodeled Home". "House on Haunted Hill" does not have an all-star cast, nor does it have all those flashy special effects, but it does have the ability to throw a few curves your way. In one scene, I actually had the hair on the back of my neck stand up, and in another I enjoyed a quick knee reflex that allowed me to kick the seat in front of me (thus enhancing the movie's frightful effect on the person sitting straight ahead.) Geoffrey Rush, Taye Diggs, Peter Gallagher, Famke Janssen all put forth great performances to make this a well-done film. I was sold on the film the moment I saw the scene (which also appears in the trailers) of the woman videotaping around the haunted house and discovers in her camera's viewer a room full of ghosts performing an operation, she then lowers the camera, looks with her own eyes, sees the room is empty, and then looks back through the camera and now sees a room full of angry ghosts staring back, and yes you guessed it, this is when the hair on my neck stood up. Some of you may remember an old Don Knotts' film, "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken", in which Don is challenged to spend a frightful evening in an old haunted house, he accepts the challenge only to be forced from the house in the middle of the night. This film, has a similar concept and a few good laughs, but the difference is that this house won't let you leave even if you want to. So I would think this movie is more like Don Knotts staying over at "Amityville". You have a touch of humor, a few special effects, a few scenes in which you close your eyes, and an ending which leaves you "hanging" with the feeling that this isn't the last time you will visit this house. Bottom line...do you really suppose there are people out there who truly would stay overnight in any situation that involves ghosts or haunted places? Because while I like to think that I would be up for a good challenge....I also know that if I couldn't have done what Don Knotts did, I surely wouldn't be able to stay a night at the "House on Haunted Hill".s</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Geoffrey Rush is obviously out to prove something. Perhaps it is that because he is such a good actor he can go and make any movie he wishes. He is sorely mistaken.House on Haunted Hill is a movie of very little appeal and made with very slight intelligence. Some movies can be as bad as this but still stick in your mind for some good things. I'm sorry to say but that just isn't going to be the case with this. Even as an excuse to show off special effects it appears very laboured.The original movie was eery and all about atmosphere. This is simply about shock tactics. there is absolutley no structure or relevancy to the actiuon. One scene just simply does not link to the next. Characters are simply introduced with a 'Hi, I'm me' approach. There are no backgrounds or reality to them at all.The whole experience just seems very empty and transparent.From the opening scene you just know that this ain't gonna be an enjoyable experience.The one brief glimpse of worthiness in the film is Chris Kattan, who brings a comical edge to what is a laughable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as bad as it looks ... honestly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know this is going to be a terrible movie, in terms of script and acting, and so it is. The plot is full of contrivances and inconsistencies - and why do the characters keep going down to the basement, when they'd be much safer up in the lobby? Rush may be made up to look like Vincent Price (nice touch), but he struggles terribly with the accent, and the other performances are all at sea (except possibly Janssen, who camps up her part with some relish - probably the only way she could get through it).Despite this, it's not all bad news. The suspense sequences may not be exactly scary, and the ultimate monster is hardly worth the money they spent on the CGI, but there are some surprisingly effective moments of Grand Guignol. The stand-out is Rush's psychotic dream sequence, which is heavily deranged in a way which seems to cross David Lynch with Redemption videos. There is also a reasonably effective pre-credits sequence (and the credits themselves are nicely handled).In other words, wait for the video, but do give it a chance, because there is some imagination at work here. Better resources might make Malone a truly original and interesting director in the future (provided he promises never to use Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack again...).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "House on Haunted Hill" ended, I walked out of the theater, not knowing what to think. I'll say this, "House on Haunted Hill" is an example of a film that will truly fuck up your mind! It's bizarre, disgusting, insane, and disturbing. I didn't think it was scary, and I didn't like it all that much. I was just deeply disturbed by what a grotesque film I had just witnessed. I also learned that the most disturbing film of the year was actually a remake of a campy horror flick starring Vincent Price, with a similar premise. The fact that this sick movie was actually a remake of a fun-filled Vincent Price flick just blows my mind! It's too sick to pay homage to it. Without all the gore, there really isn't anything to keep it alive. The atmosphere is about the only good thing I have to say about this film. It's good, when you put yourself in the character's position. Otherwise, that's about it. There is no explanation for the inexplicable events that are happening. Weird images and scenes flash across the screen, all of which are meaningless to say the least. Even that black mist at the end of the film didn't really have any background to it. I guess the director's idea was to throw in as much sick stuff into the mix as he could, in hopes that it would scare us. Contrary to what he intended, it sickens us. The absolute worst aspect of the film is the characterization. None of them, not even a single character in the film was developed in the slightest, most inconsequential form. They were just...there. What really bothered me was that much of the audience members sitting around me were comprised of 3 to 4 year old children. Here is a perfect example of how the Columbine kids were influenced by violent films. People love to blame the film industry for producing such violent shit, but the real culprits are the parents. I was brought up to believe that children watched Disney cartoons and other appropriate forms of family entertainment. I would go as far as to say that these parents, bringing their innocent young children to a film like "House on Haunted Hill", should be arrested for child abuse. Another point I would like to bring up is how lenient the MPAA is on violence and how hard they are on sex. I recently saw the Unrated version of "American Pie", which was supposedly too shocking to be shown in theaters, and "House on Haunted Hill" was a million times more shocking. The Columbine kids didn't kill because of a guy screwing a pie! "House on Haunted Hill" in my opinion, deserved an NC-17! It's that gruesome and gory! My advice to viewers out there, is too avoid this one. If you are looking for a good scare, you won't find it here. People in love with Marilyn Manson and NIN(Nine Inch Nails) will love it though. However, I'd like to add that I liked some of the sick shit NIN has done, and I did not like "House on Haunted Hill".</fullReview>

I never knew that a movie like this would have a little bit of wit, but it did. It was just a good experience. The great actings from Geoffrey Rush (one of my favorites since "Shine", who plays the charismatic rich guy here, a whole different thing) and Chris Kattan impressed me too. I didn't want Steven Price to die. Neither Pritchett. I think if this couple survived at the end, it would be more original than the assistant chick and the former pro.

I really didn't understand the relationship between Price and Evelyn, and Famke Janssen's character, for the most part, was the hardest to understand. She just whined and snapped at everybody for most of the movie. I found Taye Diggs character the most interesting. The horror elements were obviously there with all the gore, but the black fog at the end was somewhat over used. Good horror movie, but with some minor errors throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary movie with great story line.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has one of the best story lines I've ever seen in a scary movie. The story behind the houses past is absolutely terrifying. The movie started out very scary holding my attention to the screen. But as the movie went on, it got less and less creepy. Good ideas, but needed to be executed better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1986's "House" is still the only good haunted house flick I've seen. And that was mostly a dark comedy! This tries to go the horror route, but its "lets throw in everything but the kitchen sink" attitude didnt come off. Its just too darn confusing at times, with imagery that just seemed goofy. A grinning doctor in a revolving room holding a volleyball(?), a creature that speeds right up to the camera is never explained, and the demento doctor from 1931 disappears toward the end, with us never knowing where he went. Nice touch having it be Combs out of Re-Animator, though I didnt recognize him with that mustache. But so much of the rest of the film has the cast just meandering about, occasionally freaked out by a killing, or what they think are killings. Lots of "which way should we gos?" and then running when they find theyre in deep kaka. Cast was kind of a surprise, with people like Gallagher, Rush, and Diggs, accomplished actors taking part in this sort of haunted house movie for adults as your typical teens are not found anywhere. But not enough fun going on for a reccomendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crypt-Keeper would be embarassed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the team that gave us TftC: Demon Knight (Adler, Silver, Zemeckis)?!? And at least a few amusing episode of the TV series/anthology itself? What were they thinking?There's a couple of interesting plot twists, and some nifty opening F/X (I like the idea of stuff you can only see via a hand-held video camera - a neat updating of the movie to a 90's setting). The "evil" in this movie is so ill-defined that it's hard to get interested in it. Folks here keep mentioning Jeffrey Combs, but he's barely recognizable, and has very little to actually do in the movie. Maybe if they got him to play "Steven Price," the movie might have been better.And geez, Ali Larter and Bridgitte Wilson: they could be twin sisters. I swear, I thought Wilson played the woman who survived to the end, not Larter.Anyhoo, the beginning is kinda cute (cameos from Loeb and Buffy fave James Marsters), although mildly hard to believe: we're to think they shoot off a fake roller coaster car hundreds of feet through the air for every ride?!? But the intro to get the cast to the asylum is dumb (other folks have already poked fun at the "evil via the Internet" concept), the middle drags interminably (as the characters wander off on their own again...and again...and again), some stuff just don't make sense (like the Sense-Chamber - Price isn't any more insane afterwards than before, and no one apparently noticed he was wearing a squib jacket), and the ending is just goofy. Pritchard shows up as a golden ghostly figure to save our "heroes" (I use the term loosely), and the ending...Well, the Evil at the end is...well, just left there. The heroes are still alive (except trapped with no way to escape), the Evil still exists (and will probably screw up the survivors' credit ratings via the Internet, since it can do that kind of thing, being "Evil Energy" and all...), and if they do somehow get down from the top of the asylum, the police will probably arrest them as murderers.Speaking of the top of the asylum...how big is this place? Apparently you can go from the basement to the attic by going up about 3 flights of stairs, although it looks like it's about the size of the Empire State Building from the outside.Rush, Rattan, and Janssen are hammily over the top, and Daye and Wilson (I mean Larter - see what I mean?) make an appealing set of heroes. There's some entertaining imagery, even if you can't tell what the heck it means.But basically we've got a 30 minute Tales from the Crypt episode here (in fact, I think they did one like this, with talk-show host Robert Downey) padded out three times as long with a bigger budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all right way to kill an afternoon...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, well, at least it was better than `The Haunting,' this summer's big budget, special effects laden haunted house thriller. I still liked `The Haunting' on the basis of its production value, which is top-notch. One of the biggest problems with `The Haunting' was the script, which was a mess. The story was all over the place, the dialogue was poorly written. It did have a creepy mood to it, but the scares were few and far between and the ending was ridiculous.Now, about `The House on Haunted Hill,' it wasn't gargantually better than the aforementioned film, but it was scarier. I got that impression from the opening scene, which was gory and somewhat frightening. Geoffrey Rush shows a lot of range in his performances. Here, he seems to play a role that has `James Woods' written all over it. Also joining the cast is Famke Janssen of `GoldenEye.' I am still trying to figure out how good of an actress she is, for she gives very good and very bad performances, depending on the quality of the script. Once again, Taye Diggs is on board. (This film opened one week after `The Best Man.' This film was #1 at the box office and `The Best Man' was #2. Very interesting.) I must say that I truly despise Chris Kattan of `SNL' fame. His last film, `A Night at the Roxbury,' is one of the worst films ever made and I am quite annoyed with his presence. Here, he doesn't even come close to redeeming himself for that piece of cinematic trash but buries himself deeper. Oh, well. Anyway, because of its modest budget, we are deprived of the huge special effects that were so occupied with `The Haunting.' There are a few nice special effects, although the effects in the ending aren't the highlight of the story and are almost as ludicrous and uneven as `The Haunting.' I am recommending this because it has a few effective jump scenes, some nice twists, interesting characters and a couple moments of sheer suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE most horrible movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been so much better. I'm sorry, but it was way too dark. The images that get put into your mind when you see this movie are so horrifying and sick. Too horrifying. This movie should have stuck to the plot that the original 1958 version did. Obviously the person or people who made this movie are demented. Sick in the mind. The only thing that was done right with this movie is the fact that they picked Marylin Manson for the soundtrack. So don't waste your time seeing this movie. This is the kind of material that causes a lot of the crap that goes on in this world. I had no problem with "The Haunting," or "The Blair Witch Project." Those movies were scary, but not so dark. Too much "dark" just makes you want to puke. It puts a bad taste in your mouth. Only people who are sick in the mind, demented, or just plane insane will like this movie. I never want to see this movie again, and I suggest for all of you who read this comment to not see it either. You'll turn in to Mr. or Mrs. Goth if you do.</fullReview>

I mean it was good, though the ending, I do have to say, sucked, but the first hour and a half or so were very interesting. As for the cast, how do you know that they were suckered into this movie? Maybe some of them (Mr. Rush, Mr. Diggs, Miss Larter, etc.) wanted to make a campy, 50's style, B-grade kind of horror movie. It would probably be a lot of fun, and as I read in a lot of articles and interviews, the cast said they had a lot of fun. I would call it a break from serious Oscar-style dramas and whatnot. Most of all, considered what other "horror" films came out in October of 99 (excuse me while I laugh... "Bats"!) It was a decent flick to see on Halloween. Just quit your complaining and indulge in the trashiness of the film, it's not Schindler's List or Citizen Kane people. It's horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was just bad. It started off promising, with a well-done scene at a mental hospital (at this point the movie got a 9/10). That scene got me excited for the rest of the movie. Wow. Was I disappointed. The movie went steadily downhill right down to the God-awful ending. The main character, Geoffrey Rush, has a pretty cool amusement park, but highly unrealistic, so the rating went down to an 8/10. Then he invites (or WAS it him?) a group of people to the old mental hospital where everybody is locked inside. There is NO good acting by any of the lead characters. Everybody makes wisecracks in times of peril, and the death scenes (all except the one involving Brigette Wilson) are just dumb. My rating at this point PLUMMETS down to 3/10. Then I realize, "Hey! This Chris Kattan (of SNL) guy is pretty decent. And the evil doctor/butcher/killer guy is pretty cool too (probably because he's played by none other than Jeffrey Combs (of Re-Animator fame)." So the rating goes back up to 6/10. Then the movie takes some bizarre turns and decides to leave this doctor fella behind, never to be involved in the plot again (5/10). Now a new "bad guy" comes in the form of "darkness." This has got to be one of the stupidest horror movie endings in recent memory. The movie now has a 1/10. Oh, good the movie is over. Thank God it wasn't very long. Because I was in such a good mood to get out of there and because the opening scene was still cool, the rating goes up to a 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie more then I thought I would. Yes it was gruesome, creepy, dark, and horrific in it's mood and storyline. I thought it was scarier then The Haunting, but didn't have such a solid storyline. Not that the storyline was pure crap. It pretty much centers around a Sanitarium (Not a HOUSE) on a hill that housed the criminally insane. This nutcase criminals are being brutally tortured by a Dr. Richard Vannecutt. When the insane occupants escape their cells, the murder the evil doctor and his assistants. In the attempt of destroying the doctor, a fire is started which burns all the residents of the sanitarium except 5 people who manage to escape.50 something years later, a rich bitch names Evelyn (Famke Janssen) decides to have a birthday party there. Big mistake. She invites some guest, which is changed by her amusement park owning husband Stephen Price (Geoffrey). Of course the evil house has other plans and changes the guest list again. The new list includes the descendant of the 5 people who escape. Get the point? Obviously the house is haunted by the ghost of the criminally insane and the evil Doctor Vannecutt. What follows after the guest arrive are exploration in dark basements, eerie operating rooms, smelly cells, and scary surprises. I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say that now everyone will be getting that million dollars. If your looking for a bloody, scary flick with decent special effects, this is the movie for you. Worth a look.</fullReview>

Haunted Hill was creepier and scarier (though not much). I liked the tension and history of the old house and the characters were dumb enough to wander into strange situations. Staying put is never an option; let's explore only the dirtiest and darkest parts of the house. This never claimed to be the scariest movie ever and it wasn't. It was, however, entertaining and I liked it well enough. They had plenty more to work with than they displayed and there were glaring holes in the storyline and plot, but who cares??

		<shortDescription>Not bad. Not good either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, I wanted to like this movie so bad, but the thing that I kept saying afterwards was "it just didn't do it for me." I didn't go see it opening weekend, because it was supposed to stink so bad, and there were no advance reviews. Then I read some reviews that actually said it was fun, EW gave it a B- (and unfortunately, gave away a couple big shocks in their damn review), I decided to go see a matinee. It started out great. What Geoffrey Rush does for a living is such a great gimmick, and I just wish I hadn't known what would happen. Famke Jansen is nice and nasty as his shrewish wife. Jeffrey Combs plays a mad doctor again. Rush also is dressed exactly like Vincent Price, looks like him, and acts like James Woods (seriously, EW said that too -- I wonder if they didn't have him in mind. Rush looks the part much more, though). Though for some reason, it just didn't scare me that much. Lots of cool gory parts, neat, trippy imagery, not too predictable. But I don't think I jumped once, and I really wanted to. Probably, if reviews I read hadn't given a few great moments away, I would have had more fun -- also if they audience was having more fun. There was only one part where people in the theater jumped, and it was a "fake" jump (you know, like "AAAAAGH! Oh, it's you. You scared the crap outta me" type of cheap jump). I don't know what I would have done differently, and usually after a movie I don't like, I have very specific ideas and opinions about the various places the filmmakers went wrong, and what they should have done instead. Other than the ending being kind of anticlimactic, I don't know. I will say this: it beat the hell out of "The Haunting" remake that came out this summer, though that's not saying much. The first 5 minutes alone were 20 times better and scarier than the whole Haunting POS put together. Definitely superior. As far as the contest goes, I feel kind of ripped off. The theater -- a big, chain one-- didn't seem to be taking part. When we got our tickets torn, the guy said, "Be sure to stay for the scene at the end of the credits" recited like it was what they had told him to say. I figured that would have something to do with it, but it was just a typical "after the credits" scene, kind of cool, but a let down after they make it gimmicky to go out of their way to tell you to stay. What the hell? If anyone can explain this, let me know. IF they're going to go out of their way to promote the contest, and go so far as to have it on the posters (which in turn drives people away rather than brings them in, since it smacks of desperation) at least have it better organized. Oh well, you could do worse. Better than most of the crappy horror movies put out last year, and like I said, MUCH better than the Haunting.</fullReview>

I kept saying that until the last five minutes, which by the way, leave you asking questions. There's lots of lead up but no delivery.

The ending was utterly propostrous, and for those that trash The Haunting for being FX-oriented, this movie is just as FX oriented.

		<shortDescription>Mediocre, but not too insulting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is actually a number called a "bazillion", I would say that the "House on Haunted Hill" remake is a bazillion times better than that other haunted house movie of 1999, "The Haunting". Unfortunately, "The Haunting" was so bad that even being a bazillion times better is still pretty mediocre.After a pretty creepy opening sequence that sets up the house's back story and a pretty clever scene at Vincent- er, STEPHEN Price's amusement park, the movie settles into a pretty standard people in a haunted mansion story (it's a huge tower of a building, but we only see about 20 % of it's interiors). From the get-go you can tell who's going to survive and who's gonna bite it and when. The dull music doesn't create tension and the film's pacing is so poor that you don't realize that you're watching the climax until it's half over. The dialog and acting is poor, especially Famke Janssen as Price's bitchy wife. This could of been a fun role in the hands of some one much more talented at tossing of wry insults (Angelica Houston comes to mind), but Janssen is more suited to action-oriented parts (Goldeneye, Deep Rising) and not such a dialog-heavy part. Bridget Wilson also is horrible as a bitchy former TV-star, while Peter Gallagher, Ali Larter, and Taye Diggs are mearly bland, not having been given actual parts.But the movie has it's good points- Geoffrey Rush is very good as the eccentric Price, Chris Kattan is adequate as the nervous caretaker of the house, and the very cute Lisa Loeb has a cameo as a reporter. The film-makers cast the amazing Jeffrey Combs as the head ghoul, but unfortunately he has next to no screen time (check out "The Frighteners" or "Re-Animator" for some of his best performances). The sets are great, and there are some effective shocks here and there, including a set of pencils jammed through a guy's neck!All in all, this would be a good movie to see on a rainy day at your local discount theater, say for $1.99. Boo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Background: I went to this fright flick the day before Halloween. Review: I was annoyed at just how poorly developed the story for this film actually is. Once you get past the opening credits (which seem to have been lifted, technique-wise, from videos by the group Tool), there are only perhaps a couple of scenes shot with any sort of flair, and those are worn around like a new T-shirt throughout the movie. The history of the house is only there for a few reasons: 1) to provide nifty torture machinery in the bowels of the house, 2) to show why it might be 'possessed,' and 3) to explain why certain characters are in the film. This is pretty much standard for horror fare, but that is IT! There is no 'why' behind any of the history of the house. Why were experiments held there decades ago? How did the loonies take the hospital over? Who were the survivors of the past incident, and, finally, when you have a situation where there is no deep secret you've discovered to be able to control the evil house, what makes you think you can escape? I mean, it's a house! Not an evil bathroom or hallway, the entire house is supposed to be evil! Ultimately, this was a bad film with gruesome history peppered in only to justify stock scenes, and is a complete waste of time unless you're only there to see Taye Diggs or the whipped cream bikini chick from "Varsity Blues." The scenes were basic, there was nothing that made me jump in my seat, and it relied too much on special effects to overcome how deeply flawed it was. Unfortunately, today's video game generation is probably stupid enough to ask for little else. - AJH</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply another stylized entry to the horror genre. Sadly, history seems to be repeating itself as what ten years ago almost killed off the genre completely is all too prevalent in this movie.I'm referring to the two-dimensional characters, tired conventions and one of the weakest endings I've seen in a scary movie in quite sometime. While the fundamental plot is rather intriguing; having five guests try to survive the night in a haunted house for a reward of up to $5,000,000, it fails to save this movie from redundancy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This evening I had the pleasure of seeing " The House on Haunted Hill". I was waiting to see this movie since it came out last week, and after being semi dissapointed with "The Haunting", (I thought the movie was good, but the ending totally screwed it) I am proud to say this wasn't bad. In fact it was quite good. Just about all the performaces are good, especially Rush who seems to be having alot of fun in this role. I think this movie succeeds on the levels that the haunting fails, and this movie fails where "The Haunting" triumpths. Unlike its predicessor, this film fails to have any character developement, and we are just thrown into this night of terror with these people. In "The Haunting", the film took its time in the beginning to explain its characters complexities. On the levels where it outdoes "The Haunting", this offers us a more "creepy" feel, as well as some much needed thrills. On the other hand, the story line in this film is exploding with loopholes in the plot , its almost laughable. Nevertheless, this film outdoes "The Haunting" on so many levels, that you forgive the holes in the plot and enjoy the terror ride. Its almost like "Deep Blue Sea", the movie is nothing but a campy,big-budget, B-movie, "Jaws" ripoff, with an extreamly predictable plot. But for some reason, you forgive it and just have fun with it. Thats why This movie is good. MY RATING: "THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL"-8.5 "THE HAUNTING"-6.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whole new version of "It's been done before".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how a movie with so much potential and a good cast can start so wonderfully and then fall victim to"How do we finish this? I know. Let's do what I've seen so many other movies do." Where did people get the idea that black clouds of destructive smoke (or moving works of art/bas relief walls/stained glass windows) are anywhere near as scary as psychotic demons or surgical saw wielding undead doctors? I found this movie to be very exciting in the beginning and then fall way short of the mark when it came time for the moment of truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A meglomaniacal billionaire (Geoffrey Rush) invites a group of people to a legendary haunted house for a very unusual birthday party for his bitchy wife. The Billionaire then offers one million dollars to the people who survive through the night No, the plot isn't museum of screenwriting material, but it is serviceable. After all, what else can you expect from a remake of a 50s Bmovie? There is a lot of good things about this film; great photography, a lot of disturbing imagery, and a great battle of the hams between scenery chewers Rush and the very underrated Famke Janssen who plays Evelyn, the wife for whom the party is given. It's great to see these two tear into each other like a pair of rabid jackals. Unfortunately, with the good must come the bad. The editing is choppy and confusing, the dialogue was sophomoric and filled with a lot of self-conscious, ridiculous profanity and (with the exception of Jansen and Rush) the rest of the cast was wanting. But the thing that scuttled this film for me was the lamest, Deus ex Machina ending to come along since the days of the serials. It's like the producers ran out of money and told the director to end it as soon as possible. I can't think about it without cringing. In some ways,House on haunted Hill is worse than a bad movie; its a movie that could have been great, but blew the opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had one scary scene, but that was in the first twenty minutes, and it lost steam from there. Everything was very predictable as well. Unfortunately, the directors thought that gory=scary, but that is just not the case. If I see someone being cut without anesthetic or a pencil through a neck, I say, "Gross!" Anyways, like the terrible "The Haunting," this movie managed to let us down even more with the black fog thing in the end. I do not know where that came from, but know the directors said "Hey, we've got 95 minutes, let's make a killer black fog and end it there!" I guess at least they saved me 10 to 20 more minutes of this trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film obviously borrowed very heavily from the stylings of Marilyn Manson's videos, and even used one of his tunes to close out the credits. The film is a great success as long we are guessing what the hell is going on. The moment we see our enemy personified or identified we lose interest. The affair subplot is not only a waste of time but actually manages to lessen the tension that has been built up until that point.The film has moments which are truly frightening and disturbing, opening excellently, but it ends up degrading itself into a very lacklustre final 20 minutes.</fullReview>

Were the other 20 or so stories of the hospital under construction.Anyhow, I thought that this movie was horrorable, it stunk. The characters were under developed.

		<fullReview>This could have been the second best haunted House film ever (behind The Haunting 1963, NOT 1999 version). But, once again, they blew it! Like this year's overblown "The Haunting," real scares get tossed out the window at the end in favor of big computer-generated ghost effects. Hey people, a swirling dust cloud of who's who faces that have been captured (into the other world) IS NOT AND NEVER SCARY! Have you ever heard that it's the "UNKNOWN" that is frightening? It's like going to the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland and showing you that all the previous frights are just one big computer dust bunny. Swirling soil spoils the party. The phantom of this mental hospital (Of Haunted Hill) generates into a lame, linty, inkblot. "I am OZ, the great and terrible! Pay no attention to the man behind the dirty curtain".And what's with Chris Kattaan as the friendly ghost?! Anyway... Enjoy the the first 97%.</fullReview>

It is very gruesome but thats alright because thats what this kind of film has to be like. This is not the little kiddy version of a haunted house like The Haunting which came out in the summer. This film is scarier and the acting is 100 times better. I liked Geoffrey Rush and Chris Kattan who had a surprisingly large part. I hear if you stayed till the end of the credits there are some scenes answering some of the questions raised by the movie or something. However I left too early and missed out on this. Anyway I recomend it if you are looking for a good scare.</fullReview>

I have seen the original, and although this version is different, it still maintains the same plot line. The special effects are chilling, and the premise is eerie. I must say that the acting is not Academy Award winning, but then again, when is the acting Oscar winning in horror films? I found this movie to be enjoyable and spooky. It used elements of classic horror and well as a modern story line and technology. The dialog is not to die for, but that is easily covered up by the grandeur of the film set. The whole concept of the mental institution is downright creepy, and this movie has sequences of terror that are impossible to shake. Do not enter the theater making comparisons to the original, for that insures a let down experience. Rather, take the movie for what it is and have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing really horrifying about this film was that I paid to see it. This completely effects driven bit of celluloid has but one redeeming quality to me, and that is that it is not a remake of any legitimate horror classic that I am aware of. The film began with great promise, a story of a house 'brought to life' by the tormented souls of those whom suffered horrible atrocities within, a concept quickly discarded in favor of a poorly written tale of conspiracy and murder, with the supernatural evil only present to distract us from the gaping holes in what is laughably called a plot. To continue commenting at this point would be equivalent to beating a dead horse, and would only serve to bore the reader as much as this film did me, sorry had to get that last shot in, but if you've got $7.00 burning a hole in your pocket, and are looking for a little suspense and a well written horror story, may I recommend you hit the local book store and pick up a copy of The Shining, for your money, it's a much better choice.</fullReview>

This is a horrible movie in all but 2 aspects. First, the bad parts. Ok, you shouldnt even make a movie with a bad script. This, was a bad script. Every other line was. "What the hell is that ?" People would do things that they would never do in real life. No one would be as stupid as these people in the movie. The plot is almost as bad. In the begginning you think, ok this could be a CLUE like movie, but no. The plot never goes anywhere. The writers must have been debating wether or not to make it really haunted until the very end when they said screw it and wrote one of the dumbest endings ever. It was just so unbelivable, that everyone in the audiance started laughing about 2/3 into it because it was just a pathetically funny movie. But wait, it wasnt supposed to be. I'll give credit to two people, the set designer, and Jeffrey Combs. What sets there were, were really good. However, there were way to few and I think, that in a house this big, there would be more than 5 rooms. Jeffrey Combs preformance was excellent, but ofcourse, we cant have him outshinning any bigger stars, so we see him as little as possible. What a shame. Hes all its got going.</fullReview>

Wonderfully tense until they use CGI, then all disintegrates into hooey. A wonderful score accentuates the dread in film. Perfect for a matinee that will leave your less horror-film-acquainted friends shaking. Better than the Haunting, but same cop-out ending. - First Hour or so: B+ - Ending: F+ - Overall: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made a good Halloween flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ok horror movie, an excellent Halloween movie :)Rush was great in the Vincent Price role. The rest of the cast was serviceable. One interesting note: the actor playing the owner of the house (Chris Kattan) had an excellent role, got most of the laughs in the movie, and did very well overall, but sounds so much like Tom Hanks it was distracting.The visuals were stunning. Very industrial-goth. The music was ok, but didn't back up the visuals.The biggest letdown was the actual monster and the overall ending (which is classic horror-movie letdown).Hint: stay past the final credits for another scene. Nothing major, but fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truthfully, I didn't want to see this movie, and at first I didn't think it would turn in much interest... But, the backdrop of the Insane Asylume and the history beyhind it acually worked well. However, It is too bad the movie resorted in a horrible ending that seemed so thrown together that when you saw what was coming you just sit back and waited for the credits to roll so that you could leave... very sad when a movie makes you do this...The Impact the sequances of the flash-backs and the 'one' scene showing the messed up nurse was a plus and it was very regretful that we were left waiting on more of the 'real' scarey stuff to happen.. not shooting people with guns or a end villan of a spirit that almost 'never' works...The charecters were not worthy of much attention, with their predictable lines and actions... and the annoying black guy... we knew would live after grabing the butt of the girl the one scene that was totally unessasary one in which we also knew would live... It just seems you can pick them out these days... someone needs to get a clue and go back to the over-hyped but worthy horror charecters in 'Psycho'..charecters you that you can never tell are going to live or die... OR.. why not have the house win for once?.... why not kill them all? why waste our time wondering if a slut girl who is just after the money is going to survive to kill them all or not?....The movie 'is' about a haunted house, and it truely makes you mad when the people making this revolve more on making the charecters likeable rather than the true horror.. and a story-line which really could have been good.. but didn't follow through.... we all would have been truely more terrified of seeing more scenes of the wacked over evil nurses and doctors... those weird looking things in the tanks coming to life.... an old wheel-chair chasing someone down a dark hallway... or acually seeing someone end up dieing in the vate of blood....Bottom-line and advise is... the ending was terrible.. which saddly was to be expected... and to change such as this from happening again... how about getting an audiance to view it ahead of time and litterally have them tell what is wrong with it and how it could change.. and THEN go back and re-shoot it.. it would be better to have a good movie come out than a thrown together one... that you could have easily expected more out of...'House On Haunted Hill' (the remake) is over all not recommended... mainly at fault for its stupidity for going the wrong way at the end, however none of it is a prize to be won anyway... Hey movie-making people... you brought it on yourself... Kill them all next time... the old fashioned way....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay here is how it goes. This could have been such a great horror film if it wasn't for the last 5-10 minutes of it. I mean it had great casting, nice effects, great atmosphere, and interesting background. I will not go into details on what was wrong with the ending since I don't like it when people ruin movies for me. The main points I would make is that the characters built throughout the movie acted in totally uncharacteristic ways, and most of the dialog was totally moronic. It is like the writers couldn't figure out how to close and just threw it together. I love the movie up to this point with only a couple other stupid quibbles. Compared to the great horror films Halloween, Psycho, and Poltergeist( all 9/10 since I only have given one 10 ), what could have been an 8/10 is left with a 5/10. I do wish this was no the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sincerely Spooky Intentions, but a Sloppy Denouement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps to this film's credit, I never saw the original "House on Haunted Hill" and thus have no comparison. Comparing it to its summer kin "The Haunting" gives this mild effort an injection of honor, though, because unlike the super-budgeted Jan De Bont flick, this quickie about a group of people offered $1,000,000 to spend the night in a haunted house doesn't pretend to care much about the drama of the plot -- it wants to give the audience a handful of scares courtesy of slick production values and a fun, if not truly thespian, cast of stock characters. In these ambitions, we can salute this movie on its success. A few shots, especially those filmed in jittery fast motion, were affecting and oh-so-fleetingly fused with the sense of exhilaration I wished I had felt throughout more of the movie. But most of the rest is marred by faux-suspense which, to anyone familiar with any horror movie, is predictable to a point of offensive annoyance; slap-your-forehead kind of awful one-liners; stunning lapses in logic, common sense, and story consistency; and a climactic showdown that (much like "The Haunting") relies on the false presumption that an audience demands a bloated f/x manifestation of the villain (which might have actually been acceptable were the creature of this haunted house not so unidentifiably obscure and therefore boring).Nevertheless, the visuals are neat, the movie's attitude appropriately shallow and joyride-oriented, and both Geoffrey Rush and Chris Kattan once again make themselves highlights of a cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to Focus on the Goods it has to Offer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill has its frightening, disturbing moments. Most notably are the first five minutes, which introduces us to the underlying back-story of the film. In the early 1930's, a sadistic doctor in a famous sanitarium for the criminally insane conducted horrifying experiments on his patients. When the insane inmates escaped one day and proceeded on to a murderous rampage, the vicious doctor sealed the entire building--everyone died when an inferno ensued. So goes the story, a wealthy prankster decides to put up 5 people in the haunted sanitarium, offering them each 1 million dollars if they can survive the night. Within the body of the film, many visually impressive, terrifying images are introduced, but the film falls short when abandoning the ghostly doctor idea and attempting to tie in a silly subplot concerning a husband and wife who are out to kill each other and a man who becomes involved. The premise of a doctor who proves more insane than his patients is interesting, but the movie fails to cash in, deciding instead to fill in the dull moments with comic relief a la Chris Katan (who does come off as quite funny). In fact, the quantity of humor is perhaps the most distractive element in a film that could have otherwise been much more terrifying had it decided to stick with the very creepy story laid out in the introduction. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected a lot from this movie. Maybe I should not have. I figured any movie with Geoffery Rush would be good, plus Chris Kattan. This could very well have been a good movie except some of the acting by the females was not so good. It had your typical horror movie elements. Gore. and lots of it. very bloody. Girl falls down running alot and stares at the scary thing. Boy yells at her to hurry up. All people keep going into the basement even though everyone that goes down there has bad stuff happen. Could have been good had it not had these points and if the actresses would have done a little better and if there was not so much blood and gore and decapitated heads. Bravo though to Geoffery Rush and Chris Kattan. At least they were good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling horror film, especially the first ten minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when the poster for this film was put into theaters. I commented that it looked like a poster that was from the 70's. If you remember the poster for Amityville Horror, then you may recall that it had the same look to it that this one does. And I thought to myself that this must be a good sign. Most of the great horror films have come out of the 70's and early 80's. And with this one looking and feeling like an older horror film, it gave me much hope. Thankfully I was right and I was in for a treat when I watched this film. First off it has to be said that the beginning of this film is as graphic and twisted as perhaps a film like Last House on the Left and it reminded me of the ILSA films. It takes place in an insane assylum and then unspeakable things happen and when people die in here, it is quite graphic and terrifying. There is no playing games here. The go for the gusto and they remind you that this is what horror is all about. The first ten minutes of the film is what classic horror is and should be. But that also left me frightened. How does the film keep up with what it started? Can it keep me as scared as it did in the first few reels? And the answer is YES! It does stay spooky and scary. The location in this film is one of the great things about it. Where as the Haunting wasn't scary partly because of the lame surroundings, this film is scary because the house feels bad. It looks menacing and there are lots of rooms shown to us where unspeakably bad things happened in them. If there is going to be rooms where spirits live on and want revenge, then this is the place for that to happen. There is one part in the film that is one of the scarier sequences that I have ever seen in a film and it is where one of the participants sees what has to be a ghost in one of the rooms, and then it charges after her and.... well it does something. But the camera work and music and lighting all combine to make you jump in utter fear. The House On Haunted Hill is a great addition to the scary movies that have come out this year. This films does have a really weak ending and some of the music is too Rob Zombieish when it would be better served if it was more like Halloween music, but other than those two small complaints, I'd have to say that this is am intensely scary film and it should be seen and appreciated. Oh yea, one other good thing, it has Ali Larter in it. Remember the whip cream bikini girl from Varsity Blues? Well no whip cream or other pastry ideas in this film for her, but she is still great to look at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serviceable horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this flick last night and I must say that it was much better than I was expecting after not being released for review to the press. It's got some genuinely scary moments (albeit somewhat stolen from Jacob's Ladder) and a good budget to back it up. It opens strongly, builds some good tension, and does falter a bit by the end. Still, it succeeds 80% of the time in its attempts to do what The Haunting also attempted (and that movie succeeded probably less than 5% of the time). Chris Kattan is great here, managing to be hilariously funny without breaking the world of the film. I was pleasantly surprised. It's not a great film, or even a great horror film, but it's not a clunker either and is probably your best bet this weekend.</fullReview>

Great fun and fright were lost by the time the final showdown occurred. It's a shame, because unlike "Haunting", this movie was exciting for a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie has a similar name to The Haunting of Hill House (which was changed to The Haunting), it excitement resembles nothing to the latter.The movie gets down into the spooky stuff within the first 5 minutes which is what I wanted. Furthermore, the scary sequence carries out from this point till the end of the movie. The special effects was actually quite cool unlike The Haunting which was overdone. Most of the movie is presented in darkness (i.e. without much lighting) which gives it the good old-fashioned horror movie theme. The music in it is quite cool too and the characters have very animated personalities which suits the flow of the movie. It's not an excellent movie but is good enough to watch. Don't expect any jump-out-of-your-seat-shocking sequences though because there aren't any. Perfect movie to watch.</fullReview>

I was somewhat intrigued by the trailer, but also knew the trailer didn't provide much information.The first few plot setups were natural, and although nothing happened early on to make me care for the characters, I did want to find out how they would fare. The heavy use of the "F" word near the start was a bit off-putting. It added nothing.Soon, I found the plot convoluted and some scenes and characters setup ONLY to justify an effect. The House, originally visually interesting quickly melded into a "didn't we just see this room?" repeat of dark &amp; dungeony.I watched with no fear, or trepidation, and no nail biting what-so-ever. Loud, yes. Scary, no. Jeffrey Combs, I think, turned in the best performance - and like many in the theater, he just wanted to get out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror re-makes as a whole have not been very good. Psycho, The Haunting, and now House on Haunted Hill...all were very good movies in their original form. Not one of them makes for a very good re-make. ALL of the re-makes were missing something the originals had...the originals were SCARY! The re-make of Psycho was totally ruined by the commercials, if you hadn't seen the first one. You know from the commercials who the killer is, and they didn't try to play it down at all. The Haunting had only one jump-out-of-your-seat moment, and that didn't last long. House on Haunted Hill is basically the same thing. I didn't jump ONCE in this movie. There is plenty of gore and disturbing imagery for those who appreciate that, but not too much else in the way of horror or plot.One thing that really disturbs me about this movie is that Geoffrey Rush accepted the part (as Price). If you've seen Shine and/or Elizabeth, and then go see this movie, you will cringe at some of the stuff they have Rush do. It's not that Rush acts badly, as we all know, it's just that the film-makers didn't do a good job with the character.The same goes for most of the other characters too. None of them are very well written, and the film-makers decided to give them minor traits at the last minute, which they apparently felt could define them. But we're smarter than that, right?The special effects are decent, but if that's what you're looking for in a horror movie, see The Haunting.One good thing: Chris Kattan does very well with his character. He plays the average, nervous, frightened, cynical little guy, but plays it well, and was probably the best part of the movie. But I really don't understand his role at the end.I give it a 6 because it will creep some people out (mental patients and flashing, incoherent mosaics of film), because it has Geoffrey Rush, and because of Chris Kattan's work with his character.</fullReview>

There are so many twists to the story I do not wish to elaborate or spoil with details. The movie is very enjoyable whether horror scares you or not.

This time, instead of being a mansion on an isolated hilltop, it is an abandoned asylum, with a slaughteriffic history of violence and bloodshed.It's creepy, and has more than enough atmosphere and visuals, and a great looking trio of girls, but it's also not as much fun, gimmicky, or noirish as the original. Geoffrey Rush is a good actor and does well in the role, but he is not even close to Vincent Price's campy suaveness. Famke Janseen look very sexy, but her character is too mean spirited to evoke much sympathy. Lisa Loeb's cameo seems to be a bit too self aware, but that scene does have a good shock twist to it.Film degenerates in the final act, especially in the final fifteen minutes, when the black smoke appears to consume them all. That's it? That was the best they could do for an ending?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what to rate this film.Some horror films focus on gore and sometimes nudity; those are splatter flicks enjoyed more frequently by younger viewers (i.e. teens and maybe early twenties). Many older horror fans prefer films reliant on character development and atmosphere.When I was younger, I found this boring. Now I find it incredibly stupid.Beyond the opening part, most scenes have something wrong - often a complete disregard for common sense.Apparently a guy who only runs amusement parks - unlike Disney or Universal, he has no other assets spoken of - can afford to throw away millions of dollars like its nothing. Note that the existence of another big amusement park would reduce the income taken by each company, making this less believable.Ali Larter's character, on seeing the house locking itself down, preventing the cast from escaping, thinks its an attempt to scare them into leaving and forfeiting the money.Rush's character provides the guests the means (loaded guns) and motives to murder each other. Forget the $1 million, or even $5 million. The lawsuits this surely opens himself to would ruin him.Rush and Janssen play a couple who would be at home in a "Tales from the Crypt" episode. Kattan plays an unlikable guy who despite believing the house to be evil is willing to let people die for a few thousand dollars. These people play the only real characters.Larter and the other girl might have been if they stared with their mouths closed but lips slightly apart, often while looking up, they would be paid for acting. Diggs has nothing to work with besides a couple of generic "movie black guy" lines toward the start. Whoever played Blackburn kinda just stood there mostly.Essentially, there's a "Tales form the Crypt" plot line, which isn't that bad, and a haunted house plot line, which never makes sense. Even poor films like "Mirrors" and "The Unborn" had more logic to what their malevolent spirits were capable of - here, the darkness within the house was contained by cork board through most of the movie.At one point, Diggs's character or a ghost resembling him is encountered by Larter's character. That ambiguous aspect is closest the movie comes to being scary. It's ruined because either the lighting or effects team resulted in the glowy eyes.On the upside, it's very enthusiastic and feels the behind it were actually trying to make something entertaining - a feeling missing most big-budget horror films today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems like the 1959 House on Haunted Hill gets a lot of love, if for no other reason than for Vincent Price's alluring performance. I personally felt the original film was rather slow, dull, gimmicky, and totally not scary. In spite of that, and probably because this remake falls squarely within my generation, I found this rendition of the story superior.Not only does the film update the look, style, and story, but it also updates the scares...and I still think it's pretty darn scary. The opening titles themselves are creepy, with its montage of strange and gnarly imagery and Don Davis' creepy music score. The next scene, where the lunatics literally take over the asylum, is quite intense. A few other key scenes stand out as being definitely freaky, thanks largely to the strange, twitchy, unnatural-looking nature of all the ghosts and visions the characters experience. A lot of reviewers tend to harp on the film's final act: an explosive sequence in which all the ghosts pool together in a huge dark Lovecraftian mass and chases all the characters around. Most would say that these final scenes are overblown and insipid; despite such weaknesses, I always felt the big mass of ghosts was far scarier than most other things produced on film. Overall, something about the way this film reveals the ghosts, the type of imagery it uses, and the threat it emphasizes, stands out above most other ghost stories. The experience is marred just a bit by some level of cheesy acting and maybe some plot holes, but the atmosphere is effectively creepy and unnerving, and the ghosts really do freak me out.This story provides a substantial update over the original, taking the original concept and building greater depth and detail into the actual house and its ghostly occupants. There is still a twist to the plot...in fact, there are several. There are so many twists that it will require a greater suspense of disbelief. Regardless, the film is structured in a way that reveals each twist and turn without becoming too convoluted. Characters show plenty of personality; it is especially wicked to watch Geoffrey Rush, who pays some welcome homage to Vincent Price.This film is stylish and slick, with plenty of interesting and solid photography. Editing is decent. Acting can be rather silly (especially with Chris Kattan in the mix, offering a rather strange performance), but I did enjoy the cast very well. I've always had a soft spot for Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen in this film; Jeffrey Combs is very wicked in his role, and everybody else fulfills their parts well. Writing is not great, but distinctive and fun. This production features a lot of really stylish and interesting sets, props, and costumes. Some of the special effects aren't aging well, but are mostly-effective. Music is quite scary.Recommended as a rental at the least.4/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of people are invited to a party in a notorious mansion, formerly a mental institution for the criminally insane. Each guest will receive one million dollars, but there is a catch of course: they must survive the entire night. This remake of the 1959 Vincent Price movie updates the story the original while giving a darker and more sinister tone. I enjoyed the original, but for various other reasons and I honestly don't feel they are anything of the same. Besides the very basic plot and some characters, the remake is pretty much a completely different movie. If you want a good old Vincent Price movie, see the original. If you want to see a creepy ghost movie, see the remake. I enjoyed this version very much and consider it one of the better horror movie remakes. They have an exceptionally amazing cast made up of some favorites of mine like Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen, Ali Larter, Peter Gallagher, and Chris Kattan. I would not go as far as to say the characters were all likable or completely fleshed out, but you have a sense of who they all are. The performances in the movie are done very well and everyone takes their roles very seriously. A great scene that was carried on from the original was one between the host and his wife after the guests arrive. It was a wonderful look at how morbid their relationship is and hints at how far they will go to get back at one another.The opening title sequence gives an eerie introduction that is also very unique. The score is superb, setting a grand tone for the movie which is another part that I feel really makes it stand out. I love the look and feel of the movie, especially the actual house. For the entrance, they filmed at the famous Griffith Park Observatory and really made it look run-down and eerie. The far shots of the house are done with a miniature, which I feel is always a much better way to go if it can be done since it gives a much more realistic feel. As for the interior, it's very stylish and gives a classic yet dark feel. Not to mention some of the morbid art pieces displayed around the house and archaic devices used on patients. I appreciate the decision to make the house a former mental institution, putting a twist to the haunted house genre. It also gave it a more disturbing undertone to the history of the house. The doctor who ran the hospital went mad back in the early 30's who began butchering patients and conducting experiments on them. The scary part about that is things along those lines unfortunately happened in mental institutions back in the day. There are some great twists and turns that might surprise you if you have not seen the movie yet. One thing that can be appreciated is they avoid some horror movie clichés and provide answers to why everything is happening in an organic way. It's definitely not as predictable as most horror movies out there today. There is also a scene after the credits, so make sure not to miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest horrors ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one my favorite horror movies, beside "The Shining" and "Dreamcatcher". Why? Because from start to finish there is constant "jump" scares(particularly frightened me when Price found his employee's face half eaten), solid script, various interesting characters and high level of violence. Whole movie is EXTREMELY intense, though. Only it could be little more longer and little more psychological. But this is quite good. Special effects are real piece of work(specially when Darkness starts sucking everything in). Also, to mention, sequence with Price locked in room for "crazies" where he experiences seeing some horrific and twisted images is genuine and awesome. It can trip with your mind.10 out of 10. Creepy, scary, fun to watch, but little unfinished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe me or not, this is my first time seeing this film. Thought it used to be played in a big TV channel in my country, I was too young to see this when it was fresh, so I always had fear from the commercial. "House on Haunted Hill" is much likely to the same year "The Haunting", but a thousand times better.Whilst that one had bizarre machines, this one has creepy special effects, which along with the soundtrack, really scares. While that one's length was overlong, this one has the ideal time. More than that, Haunted Hills has a great directing and a decent storyline to entertain the spectator from beginning to end, which is not that easy in this kind of movie. Also, this one has some unexpected twists which I didn't see coming, so it's another plus to it's rating. I am very disappointed with this current rating on IMDb, I hope it's this low because people preferred the original (I didn't see it and I won't). Give it a watch and you won't be disappointed! 2012 edit: Just saw the original and I confess this new version is much better, even thought stories have many differences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The house that was haunted until 3/4 of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The house on haunted hill was a movie that caught my attention. The movie in my opinion wax not as good as I thought it would be. The beginning however was interesting, yet as the movie continued it got worse. The deaths were boring in my opinion. The one death that was really good was Melissa's since you don't know what occurred until the end. However the other characters deaths have nothing to do with ghosts, and when they do, it is really boring. The characters were really fake. The characters were not well developed. However the script went great with the original. Overall the movie was OK, yet it lacked hauntings and chills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie, great for it's year date. I'm glad it was remade. I would recommend this movie. I personally liked it.SPOILERS: I love how the characters were added. Not just that, but the actors and actresses that portrayed these characters. Even though it's a remake. I still enjoyed it. I like the suspense. It was scary too! Any who, I like how they killed off Bridgette's character. It was gruesome. Also how Famke's character faked her death was so great! She had me fooled. I personally like how Famke plays characters similar to this one, where she's a b****. Sadly I felt that Chris Kattan's character's death was lame. I was hoping he survived. Even if he didn't, a better death would of been much more better than this one. But I can't complain though. It's already been made and I should respect the writers plot and accept it as it is. The ending was alright. I did like how they got the money after all. Everybody else who died was great. The plot was great. The scenery was great. The effects were great. The ghost were trippy and scary as well. I like how the ghost's fit into this plot. I remember being freaked out when this movie came out. I was 11 or 12yrs old when this came out. I don't know if I first saw it in 2000 or 2001! But I admit I was scared of the movie.</fullReview>

I did fined myself shouting at the screen "RUN!" "GET UP" you no the general things they can't here but sill you shout in hope they will here you. also there was alto of suspense in the film just waiting for something freaky to happen. Apart from the obvious fact it was made in 1999 and the special effects ant quite up to date as the new films it was still a grate film.

		<fullReview>What makes this movie awesome are the sudden twists and turns in the story. Yeah, it's corny, with some stupid jokes, but it's also fun and exhilarating. Strait from the introduction of the roller-coaster you are treated to the main scare styles of the movie. If you fall for them, than this movie will keep on scaring you even with the obvious.Is it a ghost story, some cheap prank or a murder plot, you'll never know until all hell brakes lose, and even after that you get twists and turns. Wow. Best of all, it has a good pace, great acting, a nice soundtrack for a horror movie and good special effects. It's also the type of movie that has something after the credits.If you want a good scary movie with low amount of disgusting scenes, than this is one of them.While you're at it, you might want to get the 2007 sequel. But take the unrated version with the epilogue. It's not as good as this film, but then again it doesn't try to, going in a different direction, and returns Jeffrey Combs, who doesn't look a day older, as the flashback of Dr. Vannacutt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performances(?) and good scares.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason why I put a question mark next to Good Performances is because you barely ever see good performances in a scary film. But in House on Haunted hill, you do. There are many good performances. The best performance is made by Geoffry Rush. No surprise there I suppose. I also thought that Chris Kattan, Famke Jansen and Taye Diggs and I guess Ali Larter did a good performance. I'm not saying that these people were Oscar worthy I just liked their characters. I really did like House on haunted hill though. I didn't love it, but I liked it. I decided to watch it on Halloween one night and really liked it. I actually liked it more than 13 ghosts, which has the same plot as this pretty much. Both of the films are remakes though. There really isn't much wrong with House on haunted hill. This is my short review for the film. I would make it longer but I don't really want to. I liked House on haunted hill because it's scary, the acting is good and it turns into a sort of mystery after a while. I think that House on Haunted hill works and that you should see it.House on haunted hill: ***/****</fullReview>

The cast are really great for the movie including Ali Larter and Famke Jannsen and all of the cast make the movie feel like you are there trying to win the million dollar cash prize and that you'll have to survive the whole night with these vengeful killing ghosts. You so have to rent this movie or even buy it its just a great remake to the older classic version but this is our modern day life and its so dark and Gothic and just plain scary, if you are into ghost movies and haunted asylums then this movie is made for you it has all the horror elements that a ghost movie would have. I give it an outstanding 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love horror movies i consider myself to be a great fan of anything that would terrify a normal person. I watched this movie once when i was younger and i had always remembered that it was scary but i tried to watch it again a few months ago and had to turn the lights on. I was completely unprepared for the horror that awaited me in this film. It not only contains your usual amounts of blood but is also mentally scary. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who can handle being very scared and those with weak minds and who scare easily should probably keep their distance. The makers of this movie also did Ghost Ship , which is also very good not quite as scary as this one but you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House on Haunted Hill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A titanic skyscraper(..supposed to be the house of title)which rests over a giant cliff overlooking an ocean, was once a psychiatric institution operated by a very disturbed doctor(Jeffrey Combs, who is rather effective with very little dialogue)was closed down when the patients there revolted..Doc had a system of steel doors which shut by pulleys and gears locking down the place where nobody could escape. Purchased by a tycoon known for his popular hi-tech rides, Stephen Price(Geoffrey Rush)invites a group of guests to remain alive for an entire night for a million dollars each if they survive the house. Price's sexy estranged wife Evelyn(Famke Janssen)is flummoxed at who arrives, blaming him for arranging their party with people she doesn't know as payback for past behavior. Their "heated rivalry" will be open for all to see as those invited find their very lives threatened by a very dangerous force that lives within the bowels of the asylum..will anyone survive the House on Haunted Hill.It hasn't been too long ago since I watched William Malone's FEARDOTCOM and even though his films often fall apart by the end, he has adopted a camera style and "modern goth" look I'm quite pleased with. Before the look become emphasized to such a great degree in films like the SAW &amp; HOSTEL series(..among many other films, such as those made by Platinum Dunes), Malone followed David Fincher(SE7EN &amp; FIGHT CLUB, and even as far back as ALIEN?)in highly stylizing filth and decay. The bowels of his film's house where the infamous doctor and his nurses tortured lunatic patients in a variety of ways(..to "heal them") including rooms where they were kept, Malone establishes the passage of time and how such a place could certainly yield a spooky, unsettling atmosphere through the devices of corrosion, rust, cob webs, rooms in disarray(..with equipment, tools, furniture left in the same condition and places after the patients revolted against their masters, assigned to help their unfortunate mental problems, all the time harming them), rotted walls, open doors and dark corridors offering potential terror to those who find themselves walking in this area of the building. The attractive Gen X cast often find themselves in this area(..because this is where Malone wants to set the action, hoping to guarantee a roller-coaster ride for horror fans)looking to find a method of escape after the steel doors close them in.Taye Diggs(..as an ex baseball star)and the stunner Ali Larter(..as an assistant to a VP, assuming her identity to win the million)are set up as the heroes(..it's quite obvious)with Rush deliciously over-the-top as Price(..nice homage to Vincent). The film, as the original does, retains the passionate hate stewing between Price and Evelyn(..also establishing the same faux death with an accomplice/lover among the cast of characters). Janssen is smoldering even if she's a bitch always offering biting comments to those who annoy her. Chris Kattan is no Elisha Cook, Jr, but I found him amusing as the fidgety Watson Pritchett, extremely afraid of the house, who just wants to get out as fast as possible. Peter Gallagher basically plays type as a seemingly trustworthy physician, ultimately not who he seems. Bridgette Wilson is a rejected television star hoping to find another gig through what she might capture in the house by her camcorder(..the camcorder is brilliantly utilized by Malone as a device to project the supernatural, also echoing THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT in one regard). My real complaint was the ending, once the evil force rears it's ugly head and chases after those it wishes to consume, Malone abandoning the practical scare tactics in favor of CGI spookery(..he did this as well in FEARDOTCOM)..it features something that drives me nuts, characters standing still watching in shock as it comes towards them with me screaming at the screen:"RUN..YOU NITWITS!" and the conclusion, regarding their reward is preposterous.As far as the casting goes, I was very pleased with Rush assuming Vincent Price's role. Rush really plays it to the brink, not holding back, appropriate for the material I think. The supporting cast in the original was rather colorless, to be honest, so I couldn't really complain too much about the beautiful ensemble assembled here. I didn't think any of them was that bad, although the constant profanity really wasn't needed(..fitting the word f#ck in the middle of actual words really isn't necessary, is it?). KNB(Kurtzman, Nicotero, Berger)were behind some of the grisly effects(..such as Wilson and Gallagher's fates)and there's a really nightmarish sequence involving Price, trapped in a "schitzophrenic chamber" that delivers the goods. Malone also uses the fish eye lens effectively to often distort the frame, creating some discomforting visuals of the characters walking through the house, not knowing what lie ahead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While most remakes tend to jack up the budget and effects, most (particularly those cranked out by Platinum Dunes) lose the most important element of all (and what makes any film worth revisiting): the simple fun of viewing it. Based on the campy, gimmick-happy William Castle original, the new "House on Haunted Hill" tries to recapture the simple playful joy of being scared; while it's not entirely successful, director William Malone utilizes a collection of familiar--yet one-note--performers (Taye Diggs, Ali Larter, Peter Gallagher, Chris Kattan), and buoys them with a commanding, deliciously sleazy, tongue-in-cheek turn by Geoffrey Rush (who, at the time, had recently won an Oscar). Stephen Price (Rush) is an amusement-park entrepreneur who invites four strangers to spend the night in a former seaside asylum where the patients rioted and murdered the staff years before; strange things start happening, and the guests eventually discover that an angry spectral force is at work. Malone, who also directed the much-maligned "Feardotcom," brings his signature visual style to the proceedings here, dabbling in various film stocks (including scratched, black-and-white newsreel footage) and speeds (character movements that are deliberately slowed-down or sped-up), coming up with some genuinely nightmarish visuals in the process (Price's hallucination being the most notable); unfortunately, the same can't be said of the wretched CG creature that dominates the film's final minutes, and merely exemplifies how far computer animation has evolved in the span of less than a decade. Yet "House on Haunted Hill" still delivers in that crucial department of "fun," while never denying its drive-in roots; the result is a grisly, campy ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently re-watched this film, having seen it at the cinema and on DVD when it was released. I wouldn't call this film a remake, but a 're-take', as the original was ghost-free, but judging it on remake scale I'd say it was a pretty good one. An overall jump-fest with plenty of gore for the bloodlovers, a good grippy storyline, and some nice characters. The acting was mediocre from most of the cast, but having watched quite a few interviews with the director I suspect this was just the fault of poor direction. One rather annoying thing (among many I'm afraid) is the abandonment of logic and fact for the purpose of 'film gloss'. For example, several scenes feature naked girls with flowing blonde hair. The female asylum inmates were half-starved and bald-headed. So who are all these 'nymphettes' supposed to be? Hmm? A chat with the director reveals they were put in to up the t*ts rating of the film. How very mature. Other than obvious silliness of this variety, the film is a very enjoyable watch. At first I suspected poor audio production, but realised that the quiet dialogue and overly loud incidental music is perfectly planned. You turn it up to hear the dialogue, and then 'Aaaaah!' you're out of your seat the moment something scary happens. I can't help repeating many other critic's words about the 'Darkness', which is simply a hotchpotch of smoke and bad cgi faces, mirrored to make shapes. It looks like exactly that, and in my book if cgi looks like cgi, it's not worth using it. If this film had been released as book, it would be a best seller. In short, the only things that let it down are visual, and there's plenty of other eye candy (in the form of lushly creepy sets, and to-die-for lighting effects) to feast on. If you've never seen it, do so. For all it's flaws it is still a must-see. Just be warned, the house IS alive...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House On Haunted Hill is an absolutely great movie, absolutely great. I first bought this movie from a video shop, ex-rental, VHS for $5. I got home and watched it and thought, wow, that was.. awesome, I'm watching it again. I think I watched it another 3 times in that week. The story, simple, A psychiatric asylum's patients escape their cells and go burn down most of the asylum. Then a shifty owner of an amusement park invites random people to this party for his wife, to spend a night at the house on haunted hill. Now from where they first enter the house, everything gets awesome. The acting, the sets, the gore, the suspense (reminds me I found the DVD version in my local store for rent in the suspense section) and just everything. I have heard a lot of people say, well the ending was, merely OK.. but not good enough. But it doesn't matter how it ended, its just mainly the plot and whatnot need to make sense. But anyways House On Haunted Hill is a great remake to a classic (house on haunted hill by William castle) and this movie should be seen by anyone who wants a nice Friday night movie with some popcorn, remember, try to be like the characters, feel the suspense!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nifty modern remake of the 50's William Castle horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleazeball multi-millionaire amusement park impresario Stephen Price (a superbly slimy performance by Geoffrey Rush) holds a birthday party for his bitchy, faithless and conniving wife Evelyn (essayed with splendidly snarky aplomb by the ravishing Famke Janssen) at an eerie and abandoned old insane asylum with a grim history. He invites five guests who will be paid a million dollars each if they survive the night. The only problem is the house itself turns out to be quite deadly and malevolent. Director William Malone puts a very dark, brutal and gruesome spin on the enjoyable, but innocuous '59 William Castle classic; he effectively maintains a harsh and macabre, but still fun and blackly amusing tone which becomes more increasingly nasty and unnerving as the story unfolds. Moreover, Malone offers a startling wealth of shocking and disturbing visuals (the opening sequence is especially potent and jarring), stages the murder set pieces with suitably ghoulish brio, and pulls out all the freaky stops for the frantic all-hell's-breaking-loose nightmarish finale. This film further benefits from uniformly sound acting from a sturdy cast: Taye Diggs as affable baseball player Eddie Baker, Ali Larter as feisty businesswoman Sara Wolfe, Bridgette Wilson as faded TV star Melissa Margaret Marr, Peter Gallagher as cynical Dr. Donald W. Blackburn, and Chris Kattan as the house's twitchy nerd owner Watson Pritchett. Jeffrey Combs has a neat minor role as sadistic sanitarium head Dr. Benjamin Vannacutt and singer/songwriter Lisa Loeb makes a brief appearance as a television reporter. Rick Bota's glossy cinematography, the spooky'n'shuddery score by Don Davis, and the grisly make-up f/x by KNB are all likewise solid and impressive. A pleasingly twisted horror romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Castle present a fun first outing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Castle was set up to create and distribute their own horror movies. Whether this remains the case, we will have to wait and see, but if it does stay that way then hopes are high after an impressively enjoyable first outing like this one. Yes, it's a remake (and a remake of one of my favourites from the 50s) but it's one of the better remakes of recent years.The plot sees Stephen Price (played by Geoffrey Rush, in top form) invite a bunch of people to his wife's (Famke Janssen) birthday party at the titular house. Chris Kattan is on hand to provide exposition and extra jitters while the party guests (Ali Larter, Taye Diggs, Bridgette Wilson and Peter Gallagher) provide an extra mystery to be uncovered as they turn out to be completely different to those invited. As night falls, the house (formerly a sanitarium/hospital building) is closed up tighter than a duck's bottom with steel shutters sliding into place and potentially only one way out. That way, unfortunately, involves a shuffling off the mortal coil, usually helped by the ghosts (with the main one portrayed by the great Jeffrey Combs) of the house or the "darkness" that starts to fill the atmosphere.There are some dodgy practical effects in this movie but there are also some cracking moments that more than make up for that. The movie never really scares you but does provide the kind of fun thrills that the 50s movie it's based on also did so well. A great soundtrack helps (with Marilyn Manson's cover of "Sweet Dreams" being a highlight), the performances are in the spirit of things, some nice ideas are played out well and eagle-eyed viewers should look out for Lisa Loeb, James Marsters and Slavitza Jovan (respectively a singer, "Spike" from Buffy and Gozer from Ghostbusters) if you like to catch cameos.Take it in the spirit intended and you should find yourself having a brisk, fun 90 minutes. Which is, I like to think, all that Dark Castle wants to provide.See this if you like: House On Haunted Hill, Thirteen Ghosts, April Fool's Day.</fullReview>

This movie was all out very scary, and after just watching "The Grudge, its almost hard to not say that this movie is better" the ending was so good it even made me chuckle "I had nothing to do with this, I was adopted" and then when I thought it couldn't get any better, a check for millions of dollars goes through the window and the characters laugh. Then yes there is a third joke "one question?" "How are we supposed to get down from here?" Those cliché phrases were not even too "lame as others might disagree" this movie was excellent. I happened to pick this movie up for a measly 2.95$ at a local pawn shop, And I will say, that was money well spent.

		<fullReview>At least, that what the movie made me think like... it started maybe a little nice, but the story just got mixed. i didn't like the "price" couple, their dialogues, it sounded too much lame to be serious. Plus i didn't get that people will getting killed and still will think on the million bucks offerd to them. Offcurse all the things instead of reviling step by step, they just been revealed by one guy : "THE HOUSE IS ALIVE WE ARE ALL GONNA DIEEEEE!!!!" but then some ghosts appear in a groove moooooshhing effects and bizarre stuff, and then suddenly, the plot getting destroyed, people are not dead, they die twice, some dark thingi, i just didn't get it. and the ending was pretty anticipated, and really not good, not in any way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>creepy movie... shame about the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***potential spoilers*** I've been a huge fan of horror films from an early age, and House on Haunted Hill was the first movie to truly scare the hell out of me for a very long time. First of all, I thought the sets were fantastic. I love the whole 'hospital' thing, and the mood of the rooms in the basement were a great setting. And then there was those doctors, with their erratic and discontinuous movements. The scene where Bridgette Wilson's character sees the doctors through her camera screen, and they all turn their heads and look up at her, is one of my favourite scary moments in films, EVER.Unfortunately, the giant CGI cloud of evil at the end was a gigantic disappointment. I'd have been much happier seeing more of those creepy doctors, in particular Doctor Vannacut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well. I watched this film for two reasons. 1) it had Jeffrey Combs in it 2) I loved the original. JEFFREY COMBS HAD NO LINES! I was mad. And the ending was pointless. What I loved about the original was that you were never quite sure whether the house was ACTUALLY haunted. It was all a trick / in Nora's imagination etc. The ghosts / darkness whatever that was ripping up the floor? Very odd. Parts of the film were enjoyable, I liked Price's rollercoasters, and the mental asylum idea was fun (not least because I got to see Jeffrey Combs as (another) crazy psycho!) but all in all I thought it was pretty bad. Basically I enjoyed the beginning, the middle was okay, and the end ruined it completely. I couldn't help but compare Rush's Price to Price's Loren, so he was a disappointment there, but I liked Janssen's Evelyn and was glad that the reporter got to do something because she seemed to vanish from all existence in the original. I didn't find this film scary in the slightest (though Combs in the saturation chamber was creepy) and there wasn't even much gore! We got a man sliced open in the first scene, a bit of bodiless-blood, then the reporter's head etc. in a display, but that was about it. I realise that I keep trying to end this review, but I promise I am doing so now. A disappointing film, but mildly enjoyable none-the-less. WATCH THE ORIGINAL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest movie ever made, but fun nevertheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that if you sit down to watch this expecting a Silence of the Lambs caliber movie, you'll go away disappointed. The plot is very basic. Oh my god, a bunch of people are trapped in a haunted house where evil ghosts want to kill them! How original!!!! But despite its many shortcomings, it is still an enjoyable horror flick. It offers some good creeps and depending on your constitution, may or may not really stick with you.The main gist of the movie is that a really, really rich guy offers a group of random people a million dollars to spend a night in a haunted house. And, of course, the house locks up and they are forced to fight for their lives. The basic plot is old and rehashy, but the film does throw in a few cool and original ideas to spice it up quite a bit, mostly involving the monsters and various torture implements. The acting is not particularly good, but the characters are believable enough to keep it, well, believable. This film also features some really, REALLY cool special effects.I found that I enjoyed House on Haunted Hill most with a group of friends, so if you were to check out this film, it makes a great party movie.Rent or Buy - A quality rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and Spooky Haunted House Horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While some people hate this movie, I thought it was pretty good. I wasn't expecting too much from "House on Haunted Hill", but it really surprised me, actually. The film regards four strangers (Taye Diggs, Ali Larter, Bridgette Wilson, and Peter Gallagher) who are invited to a birthday party for Mrs. Evelyn Price (Famke Janssen), wife of a wealthy theme park tycoon, Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush), at an old mansion that was a former insane asylum. Then the house unexpectedly locks up and seals shut (a mechanism that was used by the doctors of the old hospital. When things got out of hand they would pull the switch and seal the place shut so nobody could escape). While trying to find a way out, they are led to the basement of the house - which is a labyrinth of endless hallways dark operating rooms. The spirits of the tortured victims that reside in the house begin to make themselves known, and each of the guests begin to vanish.A remake of the 1950s B-horror film starring Vincent Price, "House On Haunted Hill" is an extremely stylish and very scary haunted house film that but is anything but the norm when it comes to these kinds of films. The house in this film isn't your standard one - it's a tall building on the edge of a cliff, and it doesn't look like your stereotypical haunted house at all. But, the basement area of the house is very spooky. The house is given a gruesome past of a psychotic doctor who tortured his insane patients and used them for medical experiments - a very gnarly back story to be given to the place. The plot itself is well written and a nice re-working of the old Vincent Price film, and is much more interesting with plenty of twists and turns to keep the viewer entertained the whole way through.The performers are all very good. Geoffrey Rush plays the eccentric tycoon very well, and Famke Janssen plays his estranged wife very well. The party guests are all played well - are leads are Taye Diggs, who plays a baseball star, and Ali Larter who plays Sara, a woman pretending to be her boss who is the one who actually received the invitation. Both are excellent actors. The other guests include Bridgette Wilson as a wannabe television host/star, and Peter Gallagher is an eccentric medical doctor, who are both good as well. And Chris Kattan plays the quirky Watson Pritchett, who inherited the hospital/house, and provides some good comic relief throughout - he's known for comedy and he induces a few good laughs. I liked all of the actors and I didn't think any performances were bad at all.Along with the magnificent construction of the hospital/house setting, visual effects and cinematography play a big part in the film as well. There are plenty of excellently-done special effects and some very intense CGI pieces, especially at the end of the film. The film is visually very good looking. The ghosts are also presented in a unique fashion, and are all scary as hell. Lots of jumpy camera-work, scary makeup effects, and neat visuals make the ghosts unlike any others I've seen in a horror film, and also very scary. The CGI blow-out effects at the end present the ghosts as whole, evil entity, which was a decent idea, but I suppose could have been a little better. Many people were disappointed with the way the film ended, but I didn't think it was too horrible. A little more of a resolution would have been beneficial, because it ends rather abruptly. But I wasn't too disappointed with it - while they are trapped on a ledge a good 200 feet above a rock cliff, they escaped and made it out alive, so I was happy.Overall, "House On Haunted Hill" is a unique haunted house movie, with some neat visuals and plenty of scary scenes. It's not your standard haunted house horror movie, but it's very stylish and it has some good things to offer. If you're tired of those stereotypical haunted house films set in an eerie mansion on a stormy night, this film is a good change from the norm. All in all, good ghostly fun with an almost classical tone to it. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!So that's how it's done!!! It had been so long since I had seen a genuinely scary horror movie. When I taped this one off of pay-per-view I was stunned speechless. This is a superb remake of the original William Castle film--superb because it doesn't really try to compete with the original. It does its own thing, and the result is outrageous, and genuinely creepy. I honestly can't praise the filmmakers enough. The movie has the look, the scares, the acting. The entire cast was very good, but particularly notable are the performances from Peter Gallagher, Chris Kataan, and Geoffrey Rush who appear to be having a blast with this movie.The film also stands up to repeat viewing. It wasn't that long ago I watched it again on TNT, and it held my attention every bit as well as when I first viewed it.If all you crave is CGI effects, go with Spielberg's expensive, bad remake of _The Haunting_. On the other hand, if you want to remember what it's like to jump in your seat, rent or buy _House On Haunted Hill_.Heh-heh, it's preeeeeeeeeeeety scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, solid, horror flick!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the only horror movie I have ever seen, that scared me witless for at least a night. I don't know what it is! I've seen the Exorcist, The Ring, and many others, but they all failed to have any impact on me whatsoever. This, however, freaked me out the first time I saw it, and it still does. Geoffrey Rush is absolutely awesome in his role, as the seedy, slimy theme park mogul, and Famke Janssen is spot on as his sardonic wife. The two have a fantastic way of playing off each other, and it's bar none the best acting in the movie. Although horror movies are never REALLY known for their acting, these two do a superb job. The rest of the cast is good enough for their roles, which basically consist of screaming, running, and looking scared. Chris Kattan is the standout of the rest, in my opinion, offering some cynical humour here and there. Ali Larter, is merely okay, as she pretty much always is, and Taye Diggs is good enough, though of course he's done MUCH better work. But you can tell they are all enjoying their roles, and having a bit of fun with it. I don't know who played the Doctor, but that guy scared the living crap out of me, I can tell you that much! When they play back Melissa's video, with him moving in choppy slow motion, I just freak out. There is something so infinitely creepy about that guy, and whoever he is, he worked wonders for the movie. Though it does taper off towards the end, with some bad CGI effects, overall this is a Grade A, horror flick, and always one of my personal favourites! I strongly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Castle's classic 1958 film "House on Haunted Hill" finally hits the screens for modern audiences, starring Geoffrey Rush as an eccentric theme park tycoon who throws a birthday bash for his wife inside Dr. Vanacutt's Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane, offering a group of strangers a MILLION DOLLARS EACH if they can stay alive and spend the night inside the walls of the house on haunted hill. And boy, it's going to be a freakin' long night, I'll tell you...This is probably the scariest flick I've ever had the pleasure of watching, (but, admittedly, I'm not a big horror-movie fan). It's a classic haunted house story, with plenty of crazy special f/x and sour dialogue for today's modern moviegoers. Infinitely better than the '58 version, this one sees Rush playing the role that Vincent Price perfected forty years ago. Rush does a commendable job capturing the spirit and wit of mogule Steven Price (named as an ode to Vincent). Famke Jansson (better known as "Goldeneye"'s Xenia Onatopp) stars as Mr. Price's twisted, bitchy wife.And standing out amongst the rest of the cast is "Saturday Night Live"'s Chris Kattan, playing Watson Pritchett. Kattan undoubtedly steals the show and lends a heaping dose of dark humour inside the grimy, blood-stained walls of the haunted house...The fun slowly degenerates into your average thriller: the guests all split up (because, as we all know, travelling through a treacherous haunted house ALONE is always safer), and each gets their share of nasty little shocks. The old asylum's mysterious "lockdown" mechanism suddenly kicks into action and traps the guests in the house. MAJOR "Uh-oh!"The majority of the film takes place in the basement of the asylum, dishing up a truly disturbing experience as the cast traverse through the dark, maze-like hallways, amidst old wheelchairs and hospital equipment. Oh! And did I mention that the place is haunted? Yeah, it seems that in the forty's, awful experiments were done on helpless patients by the demented Dr. Vanacutt, experiments that brought human torture to new depths of depravity...But hey, it's all part of the fun, isn't it?A modern classic of terror. Be sure to pick up 1999's "House on Haunted Hill", as it will give you plenty of chills, thrills, scares --- and, trust me, more than enough truly disturbing back-story to freak you out for quite some time...Have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is an important distinction between horror movies and slashers.This is well evident when you take two good examples of each genre by an acclaimed director as Carpenter:Halloween and In the Mouth of Madness for instance.A good horror movie does not play with sudden movements,screams,jumps etc.It builds upon the situation,and although both Halloween and IMM are good films,they are utterly different in that respect.IMM beautifully transforms normailty into its extreme opposite,where anything that you would normally cling on to pursue a sane life takes you deeper into madness.This is the main trick in a good horror film...Finding yourself in a reversed world,at least for a few hours or so,and asking the question "what if?",is the main idea upon which terror is built. Now,of course, the very clear opposites of sanity and normality are insanity and ubnormailty.That is why we keep seeing horror films featuring mentally sick and/or physically deformed characters.They are the visual reflections of our most intimate fears.(On an extreme level,this may take the form of the innocent transforming into the evil.Omen,The Exorcist etc.)For that reason I really though that House on Haunted Hill could be a nice horror film.However,an extremely weak story with no concrete links between consecutive scenes and the big mistake of combining horror with the worst example of slasher, made it a big mess. The story begins in an asylum where the mad psychiatrist is murdered by the patients.Somehow similar to the Fredy Kruger story:A woman raped by the insane giving birth to evil-an already insane man killed by his likes giving birth to another sort of evil.A pretty good intro for a horror film...Then what happens?The story itself gets horrible.Although we do get some good "through the camcorder" shots (much like the Aphex Twin video "Come to Daddy"), we get no story at all.Principle No.1 in film making:First know "what" you are going to shoot,then work on "how" you are going to shoot it.Here,the "how" part is more or less well-done (though,in some scenes over-done),but "what" is the story? *SPOILERS* We have an unnecessary sub-plot of a love triangle,a slasher-movie "victim team" and a stupid "evil spirit of the house" which appears out of nowhere.It is even hard to decide which part is out of context.What happens to the dead-mad doctor,which we see through the security cam?Was he really mad,or possessed by the evil spirit of the house?Or is he the evil spirit?If not what is the evil spirit?Was the asylum built upon an ancient Indian cemetery?Will the African-American guy marry the white girl and have gay and lesbian Asian-American children to make the film even more politically correct? A total insult to the genre.Don't watch it if you don't want to waste your time in a most unnecessary fashion and get confused as to why you ever did so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where did it all go wrong? What could've been a pleasantly nasty, camp little B-movie instead becomes a non-stop headache thanks to a mega-weak script and some atrocious direction. At first glance, the assembled cast looks promising; in any normal production, Geoffry Rush, Famke Janssen, Peter Gallagher and Jeffrey Combs are all engaging at worst. But the stellar talent on display are quickly wasted due to some incredibly bad dialogue and a ludicrous narrative. Characters die and are resurrected with no real explanation; illicit affairs are uncovered that make absolutely no sense in the context of the story; the various ghost fodder are kept strictly as one-dimensional caricatures, right down to "Heroic Black Guy" and "Sceptical Non-Believer". The clutch of decent chills (Brigette Wilson's camcorder run-in with a ghostly operation comes to mind) can't save this turkey; by the end, you'll be begging for some aspirin to dispell your neon-lit headache. Avoid, even if you're a staunch horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill (1999) D: William Malone. Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen, Ali Larter, Taye Diggs, Chris Kattan, Peter Gallagher, Jeffrey Combs, Max Perlich. Remake of Vincent Price's 1958 original has a millionaire offering a group of twentysomethings $1 million each?if they can spend the night in a haunted house (formerly an insane asylum). Another film in which the characters wander off into dark places alone, mutter one liners during tense moments, and stand there looking stupid when they should be running for their lives. After seeing this film, it is clear that the 90s style `pop-culture' horror movie is getting REALLY old! RATING: 3 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence, grisly images, and strong language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Price makes me sweat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often, a film glides across the big screen and leaves a mark on my mental page of movie reviews. When I first saw Steven Price, I could not believe how unbelieveable handsome he is. My eyes did not move over the built and buff Eddie (Diggs) or any of the others, my eyes stayed glued to him! I also must say that I love this film. It brings to us all that makes for good old fashioned fun. It begins with a violent scene featuring mentally ill patients breaking out of their prisons and taking over the asylum.They then capture and brutalize the sadistic staff. Then, Price (ooooh!) throws a party for his wife, who he detests, in the hope that someone there will either kill her,(with the guns that Price furnishes in tiny coffins) or leave her alone to carry out her plan to execute Price with her lover and then split with his wads of cash. Her only option we discover since Price will not give her a divorce (duh! What wealthy guy is just going to hand over half of his billions?) Or... everyone believes that Price is dead (killed by Sarah) so he can give Evelyn the biggest bday surprise of her life. During all this, Sarah, Melissa (who is consumed by the house) Eddie, Donald and Prichett (who is constantly reminding us that the house is "alive") slowly evolve from greedy freaks who want the millions, to scared silly.Although Price and his theme park assistant Carl Shecter (Perlich) organize some scary stunts, it isn't long before Price realizes that someone other than him and Shecter is trying to outdo their terror tactics. The saturation chamber scene goes down in history as one of the most bizarre horror scenes and Price's revenge on Evelyn in the end is great! See this movie, you'll love it! Keep your eyes on that tall, dark and handsome Mr. Price! My only problem with this movie: watching Price become consumed by the shadow and then tortured in the basement along with Evelyn after the end credits. NO FAIR! ;) Any women who share my infatuation with Steven Price email me! Bye! Danielle ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a personal favorite of mine. Could it be because I am such a sucker for haunted house movies? Who knows? Anyway the "House on Haunted Hill" remake of the 50's classic was entertaining and full of twists and surprises.In the movie guests arrive to an old insane asylum that is now being repaired. They were chosen by an eccentric theme park designer for his wife's birthday party. Or were they? Each seemed to have arrived under suspicious circumstances but stay for the promise of a million dollars. The only catch is they have to survive the night...Doesn't sound hard BUT the house is haunted and is home to an ancient evil. The "evil" in this film was very impressive and so were the effects used to depict the ghosts. There were many special effects and cool camera tricks that added to the horror. Possibly the most stylish horror film to be released that year (1999).I highly recommend this movie to any horror buff who loves blood and odd forms of torture!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that begins well but soon falls into a downward spiral of nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given that I've never seen the original 1958 version of House on Haunted Hill, I didn't know what to expect from this. Although the film is pretty much a follow up to the 90's horror cliche its a fairly adequate movie.Some scenes in the movie were disturbing and frightening and in this movie case, that is used to its advantage. For the first 45 minutes most of the scares are psychological which add to the films authenticity. But then they ruin the last 20 minutes of the movie by resorting to CGI. The Computer generated monster/thing at the end doesn't follow suit and thus ruins whatever originality the film had.And now, a synopsis of the acting. Geoffrey Rush holds the only perceptibly good part part in the movie as Stephen Pryce. Famke Jansen is OK as the man-eater, Evelyn, but her character gets annoying. Ali Carter (Sara)is a very uninvolving character who can't do much other than scream and run. Bridgette Wilson (Melissa) could have been used more but looks and acts very well. Chris Kattan (Watson)establishes a great character. Taye Diggs (Eddie) isn't a great lead and shouldn't have appeared in the movie in the first place. Peter Gallagher(Donald) stands out of the limelight for the most part. On the whole, this movie is OK (if flawed) and satisfactory. 5.4 out of 10.</fullReview>

The special effects, though beautiful, created only meaningless atmosphere, not making up for the lack of good performances. It didn't seem that much thought or effort went into actually making this movie good.This is a slight spoiler, but not really.

		<fullReview>This is a movie that you would love to see remade. It has better special effects than the original and a much darker atmosphere. This one starts off as all of the lunatics in an asylum break out and kill the doctors in the 50's. The place gets burned to the ground and is later used as a party place for Geoffrey Rush and his bitchy wife Famke Janssen. Great acting from both of them playing the parts cool all the way through. Geoffrey Rush even looks like the originals Vincent Price. Anyway, The couple gather the guests to the house who mysteriously get knocked off one by one by some of the murderous lunatic ghosts. Great special effects and make up and some truly mental and terrifying images appear all around. In the original, only 2 people get killed. In this one, everybody but 2 people get killed. Very nice! After the chases and slicing and dicing you will be satisfied with quite a decent ending. Good acting, gore and comedy from Chris Kattan make it a fun watch with your mates or to be scared on your own. The original was good, but this one is the icing on the cake! 8 out of 10. Also check out the amazing 'Zombie' deleted scene on the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have loved this film would it not have been for its mind-numbingly dumb and enfuriatingly out-of-character "end-solution".Everything up until then was horror at its best. Although not shying away from special effects such as deformed bodies and slain intestines, the director also succeeds at scaring his audience with what he doesn't let them know and what he doesn't show them, which is ultimately always a LOT MORE scary.But moving into CGI (computer-generated imagery), the movie falls flat. The reference to ink-stains in an asylum may be clever, but the execution looks cheap, sometimes even outright amateurish. Luckily this happens only very late in the movie.Speaking of which - the ending is so bad it almost tarnishes the whole film. The use of amateurish CGI, the final showdown, the "solution", the "added bonus" and the completely inappropriate reactions by the remaining characters - it all made me wonder whether they used a different director and writer for the last couple of minutes of the movie just to make it conform to the worst of Hollywood standards. It was just hard to believe the original writer and director had envisioned such a pathetic ending to an otherwise excellent and entertaining horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this film didn't openly invite comparisons between itself and the 1959 original (starring Vincent Price), it wouldn't be a half-bad B-movie. It scores high on the modern horror flick checklist: Gratuitously gory? Check. Glaring "good people vs. evil monsters" theme? Check. Lack of real psychological involvement made up for with slick effects and "jump" scenes? Check.However, this film BEGS to be compared, even down to the host's name and demeanor. The character is named Steven Price, and seems a pale imitation of the original, from the looks/hair/moustache, to the fashion sense, and to the demeanor. It appears they hired a Vincent Price imitator to play the role, not an actor.Even the exchanges between Price and his wife lack the panache of the original; while equally vicious, they're not nearly as clever.The purely psychological storyline of the 1959 original is here distorted into yet another effects-dependent, weakly-scripted gore-a-thon. I'd save my rental dollars, skip this one, and head to the Classics section (or the Vincent Price shelf, if your video store has one) for the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another bad example of how to do a horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone must tell the director of this picture that horror and camp features and idiotic death scenes do not belong in a serious horror movie. There are only three good scares, and while they are excellently done, three just doesn't cut it. It also had a good plot idea, what a shame.Just to show you how unbelievable the characters are, here is an example: At the end of the film, the two surviving characters have faced trauma-inducing events, seen people bludgeoned, electro-shocked, etc, etc, and at the end of the film, the two actors are laughing because they got everyone else's money they were supposed to get for surviving the night (that being a million dollars of course - could this be the start of a new reality show? Haunted house survivor?). And the scene that preceeded it, left me laughing (literally) at how humorously bad the SFX and the scene itself was.I suggest you pick up The Haunting (a really underrated film) which is actually decent. I wasn't expecting a bad movie when I sat down to watch it, but I had witnessed a really bad horror movie - you know, like they all are nowadays.3 out of 10.'Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* This is not a bad movie. In a world where Scream-like movies dominate this was a refreshing change. The acting is a little shallow in areas. There are some scares though. Some very creepy images were enough to make this a scary movie. Where the movie went wrong was at the end where it succumbed to "Lets hurry up and finish this now" syndrome. The whole thing goes wrong right after the final physical fight scene between Price and his wife. He wants to KILL her yet when the evil "DARKNESS" of the house starts erupting from a room in the basement, he screams for her to get up and get out of the room. This was totally out of character for Price and his wife. At this point the computer generated Images take over and suffocate this film. If they just would have stuck with the whole Dr. Vanacutt scenario, this film would have been one major creep-fest.</fullReview>

C'mon, get real.What it does accompolish is its innovative use of lighting and, dare I say it, camera movement. It really does give you a sense that the house is alive. Of course there are images that make us scream Se7en or Hellraiser but the show, I feel, does succeed on its own merits.Go watch it on a dark gloomy day and don't expect to be scared stiff, just entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sure is a funky old house, ain't it?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Says Steven H. Price in the House on Haunted Hill. This is one of the best horror movies I have seen in awhile. One of the complaints is that the ending is abrupt-and it is, somewhat, but I enjoyed the picture anyway. besides, the original version of this move (Starring Vincent Price) only ran about an hour and fifteen minutes. This version shares little more than the name and bare bones plot of the original. Some of the characters are similar, such as the bickering Host and Hostess (Played here by Rush and Janssen) the doctor(Gallager) and the nervous owner(Kattan) I have seen both versions, and I love them both.In the story, Geoffrey Rush plays hammy amusement park owner Steven Price, with Janssen as his beautiful, but deadly wife Evelyn. I say deadly because the missus has tried to bump Steven off a few times (but he is unable to prove it). Evelyn wants her birthday party to be held in an abandoned asylum, and despite Price's objections, she does so. She leaves her guest list with Price, who shreds it in favor of his own. However, when the guests show up, both Steven and Evelyn deny knowing them (But are they telling the truth?). They include former Baseball pro Eddie(Diggs), Dr. Blackburn(Gallager) T.V. Personality Melissa(Wilson) and the current owner(Kattan, who is petrified Of the house, and just wants to collect his money and leave). As the evening continues, Strange things start to happen, people start to disappear, and Price and Evelyn Each believe the other is responsible for it. Overall, I loved this movie. Rush is fantastic as Price. Lots of people have said that they felt his performance was hammy, but his CHARACTER is hammy. Steven Price is obviously a showman (His first scene in the movie shows us that),He's totally in his thrills and chills element, and he's trying to scare the hell out of his fellow guests. I also liked his somewhat sleazy interpretation of the role of Price. Instead of the Suave Frederick Loren(The character Vincent Price played in the original, ) We get a sinister, and somewhat twisted, interpretation of the role. But can we really blame Steven Price for being twisted? After all, he's married to a woman who would love to see him dead. And, as I said earlier, has TRIED to see him dead. Anyway, I say bravo to Geoffrey Rush, the movie would not have been the same without him.Okay, I've patted Geoffrey Rush on the back enough for one night. I also have to give kudos to Famke Janssen. She was also fantastic as Evelyn, giving just the right amount of nastiness to the role. And gives the perfect portrayal of a woman married to a man for his money. Also, Chris Kattan is terrific as Pritchett, a man terrified of a house. Pritchett's grandfather and father have both died after gaining ownership of the institute, his grandfather in his sleep, and his father in a construction accident. Pritchett believes the "House" is responsible. He just wants to collect his money and get out. He has no interest in the million dollars Price is offering the other guests, he doesn't really care what they do, as long as he can leave. Kattan gives a more neurotic preformance of the role(Elisha Cook Jr. Played him in the original)and Kattan is very good. Gallager also does a good job, He doesn't have a lot to do until towards the end, but he does it effectively. and Diggs does a great job as the hero, Larter also does great as his love intrest, and Wilson, kind of in a throwaway role, is great as Melissa. Also, to a lesser extent, Perlich and Combs both give a great performance.House on Haunted hill is exactly what it's supposed to be, a scary, but fun, movie. There are lots of scary moments in it. Another reviewer compared the Asylum in this movie to the Overlook Hotel in the movie "The Shining"(Also one of my favorite horror movies)I think that is a good comparison. It's not a flawless film like "Citizen Kane", but it's highly entertaining and I found myself genuinely scared. Give it a look. I don't think you'll be disapointed. Also, give the original a look. You won't be disappointed with it either. Decide which one you like better. (Or, if your like me, don't try to choose, like them both!)10/10 or ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunted House on the Hill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hill is not haunted, the house is.Robert Zemeckis and Joel Silver's Dark Castle production company debuted with this schlocker from late 1999. Specializing in hokey b-horror material in the vein of their Tales from the Crypt TV series, Dark Castle was founded on a low-aiming but crowd-pleasing formula. But then they started making garbage like RocknRolla.For this remake of the 1959 Vincent Price movie director William Malone re-stages the events in a notorious mental hospital closed after an patient uprising and fire in 1931. Eccentric theme park engineer Steven Price (a delightfully hammy Geoffrey Rush) has set-up fake scares for his wicked wife's birthday party guests (including Jeff Goldblum/Billy Zane cross-breed Peter Gallagher). But little does he know that a legion of spooks, specters, and spirits plan on massacring them...one by one...snooze.HoHH clearly has many scenes cut short or exised altogether. The first thirty minutes feature far too many 'plodding around in dark corridor' scenes and some dreadful dialogue. In my expert opinion, THESE scenes should have been trimmed and the plot beefed-up.What the movie does get right is the atmosphere of dread and evil. Malone gives us lots of scary imagery, practical make-up and special effects, but undoes it all with an ending that involves a lazy, kaleidoscopic, CGI death cloud.With tighter writing and direction HoHH could have been a worthy remake, but as it is it's just serviceable B-horror with an interesting cast that are, unfortunately, given very little to do.</fullReview>

There was next to no character development, the storyline left you knowing less than you did before, and the director went for cheap audience attracting tricks (unnecessary naked women shots, lots of blood and gore, etc) but you have to stop and ask yourself... Why are you watching this movie?If you want to get scared, then this movie does just that. Its' creepy environment and extensive host of surprises will keep you well spooked.But if you came for a psychologically provocative example of art in motion, then this is not the movie for you. The characters leave much to be desired and you'll stress over all of the plot holes.So start out ready to be thrilled, stop thinking, and just enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill was an exceptional horror film. Taking on the atmosphere of the classic original, the new version will send chills through the hardest horror buff. The story was both reliable and believable. The effects were intense and scary. Unlike The Haunting, this film relied on classic effects and visual torment (the fast-moving heads are the best!) rather than on expensive CGI images. The only thing that kept this from a 10 was the black evil seen at the end. On the big screen, the details were noticeable and spine-tingling. On video, however, it looks entirely fake and lacking. The scare factor diminishes. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good scare and really creepy house!</fullReview>

Add to this the fact that most of the characters were annoyingly perfect "I know what you did last summer" types and you didn't really care when they were eventually picked off.Oh, and the ending felt too rushed as if the director couldn't think of any more ways to bump off the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just the concept, that a group of people who seem to have nothing in common would be offered $1,000,000 for what seems to be an easy task...surviving through the night. Now that's a good one! It drew a pretty decent crowd at the theater too. Admittedly, I'm an old-school fan when it comes to Horror. Wes Craven, John Carpenter and even some Clive Barker were some of my favorites. This is just a few of the names in Horror that set the bar where it is for Horror Films today.When this came out, we had just recently been subjected to "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer" etc. They don't hold a candle to this one.It wasn't until well after I'd seen this version that I saw the original. Now I own both of them and admire them both. This really stayed true to a lot of the concepts in the original. They didn't really try to re-invent the wheel here. They just sort of polished it up a bit.This is a breath of fresh air compared to the recycled plots/plot-twists of most other Horror Films of that time.It's my opinion that Vincent Price would approve of this one. Geoffrey Rush really pulls this one off well. This and his portrayal of Captain Barbosa are second to none. Chris Kattan is pretty funny too. Especially when he reveals what he knows about the house. That and the bit about the scotch. The house itself is eerie too. Even if you know Horror Films, there's a few scenes that raise the hairs on the back of your neck.Perfect 10 out of 10 for being a good remake and for not force-feeding us trendy garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All 'trick', no 'treat'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first rule of thumb for a horror movie is: Be Scary...or at least chilling. The makers of this Video NyTol apparently decided to 'break the rules' because this quickie, so self-consciously designed to look just like an old 'B-grade' 60's horror flick, has not a single moment that inspires anything other than tapping one's fingers, waiting, HOPING, for something resembling entertainment. This is the direct result of a director who seems to have been permanently out to lunch and actors who couldn't possibly have done worse if they'd phoned-in their performances. Maybe that would have been preferable because then we'd have been spared Chris Kattan, who single-handedly proves once and for all that "Saturday Night Live" is a cesspool for (ahem) 'talent'. Having styled himself so blatantly after Mike Myers, Mr. Kattan joins former SNL-ers Chris Farley, David Spade and Norm McDonald in a select group that actually has NEGATIVE screen charisma. (Wasn't "Night at the Roxbury" lesson enough?) Geoffrey Rush very nearly begs the question of why he was ever awarded an Oscar, he gives so overbaked a performance, one that is quite matched by former Bond Villainess Famke Janssen and model-turned-"actress" Bridgette Wilson. And talk about predictable!!! If you've been living under a rock on another planet, you'd STILL be hard-pressed not to guess every twist and turn; I dare you NOT to guess the ending within the first 5 minutes. Of course, you may NEED to guess the ending in the first 5 minutes because odds are you won't make it through the rest of it without falling fast asleep. But, if by some miracle, you actually DO stay awake (a feat for which there should be a reward, something this movie doesn't provide, I assure you), you will be treated to the cheesiest-looking apparition to come along since those moaning black blobs from "Ghost". This claptrap isn't even so bad it's funny; it's just plain bad. No, worse: it's BORING!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a long time since the word "frightening" really applied to horror movies. It seems that 1999 has seen the end of that. Where The Haunting remake failed, this remake of The House On Haunted Hill comes to lead us into a new era of horror movies that actually seem to aim for fear. There are some inconsistancies along the way, but most people will not notice on the first viewing - I didn't. It is safe to say that if you actually LIKE horror movies, you will enjoy this. If, however, you are one of the weirdos out there who likes to go watch horror movies just so that they can say how much they hate them, you won't have any fun.

		<shortDescription>Excellently crafted. A modern update of the classic haunted house formula...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest haunted house film is nothing like its disapointing predecessor, The Haunting. In fact, Haunted Hill is the exact opposite. The story(yes, there is one) involves a maniacal doctor(played by Jeffrey Combs) who liked to experiment on the patients of an asylum. The film starts with the patients breaking out and killing almost the entire staff before being caught in a blaze that burned down the asylum. All but five people were killed. Flash forward seventy or so years. The wife(Famke Janssen) of a rich amusement park owner(Geoffrey Rush, doing his best Vincent Price immitation) hears about the place on some bizzare TV show(Terrifying but True?) and decides it would be a good place to have a birthday party. The people that get invited aren't the ones on eithers list, though. They get to the house and you can see for yourself what happens next.Even after the amazing disapointment that was The Haunting the trailer for this film still looked promising(with the exception of the ghost effects). Haunted Hill had a number of things going for it: a great cast; a good story; a perfect setting. Unlike The Haunting, this one decided to actually be frightening. The set design alone is enough to set one on edge. This film takes the term Gothic to an extreme. Of course, a large portion of the credit goes to William Malone. He's created some of the most disturbing images I've ever seen. The deformed characters and occasional flashbacks are well timed and serve to create an incredibly intense experience. The performances are all top notch, bringing a certain reality to their characters so seldom seen in Horror films. They make you believe what's happening and make you care about the outcome. Very rare, indeed.If I were to pick one pitfall Haunted Hill stumbles into it would be the finale. While it does provide a good amount of terror, it comes on much too abruptly and ends far too soon(it lasts less than five minutes). It also fails to answer a number of questions. However, this is but one low point.I'm sure you've already realized that I loved this film. There's simply so much to like and so little to dislike, but it's deffinately not for everyone. In fact, I'd warn most people away from it because of its intensity. The level of violence is also quite high in certain scenes, so if you have a weak stomach stay far away. Even if the violence doesn't get you the psychological impact will. The House On Haunted Hill is going to hit you and it will hit you hard. Those of you who think you're up for a ride you'll never, and I mean never, forget step up and get on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: This movie is not for the faint of heart. There is much gore and blood, and torture scenes.The premis: A master of thrills, Steven Price, throws a special birthday party for his wife, Evelyn. He invites five friends to win $1,000,000 at the crack of dawn if they stay all night in the house, and of course live. But the people who show up are not who he invited, then people start dying.As the first sentence states, there is a lot of gore and blood and guts. The house used to be a physiatric hospital for the criminally insane. There are torture scenes from the house's past life which can be disturbing.Chris Kattan is hysterical as the house's current owner, who gets trapped inside with the other "victims". Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen, together as the couple that love to hate each other. Taye Diggs, the silent hero. Peter Gallagher, the wife's lover. Ali Larter, the silent heroine. Bridgette Wilson, the girl looking for a story.What will happen in the night?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Six people must spend a night in a haunted house if they want to collect a million dollars. There is one little catch - they have to survive the night.I went in fully expecting another "Haunting" (this summer's fiasco as opposed to the excellent original) and as the lights went down I cursed Tim Burton for failing to push up his release date. Amazingly enough, not only did "House" not suck, it was actually enjoyable.The writers took the time to create a decent story-line, complete with a viable subplot (it may be thin, but this is horror...) I was especially thankful that the special effects are used sparingly and are there to support the film rather than overwhelm it. In addition, innovative cinematography (patterned on "Jacob's Ladder") helps to build and sustain mood. Most importantly, the movie is scary - there was a lot of screaming going on.For a good spooky film that doesn't rely solely on body counts, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I went into this movie expecting very little, but left with some very genuine scares. This movie is actually pretty good. The acting is decent with Geoffrey Rush and Taye Diggs. The directing is superb. It's almost like watching a 90-minute Tool video. The setting is awesome, with the house being the definition of cool. The special effects were also pretty good, the only downfall being the last ghost. It was to computery, and didn't have enough substance. Overall it was a good movie, with a good build-up of suspense and atmosphere. A must see in this Halloween time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highly amusing treatment of the 'people stay in haunted house overnight' scenario. The surreal Mr. Price (who can only be described as Walt Disney in Vincent Price's clothing) is probably the most fun to watch. He just has a really bad night, what can I say. Some disturbing gore in the opening scenes and in the ghostly manifestations might be highly upsetting to the squeamish, but is was far from gratitous. This isn't a slasher flick, but a good ole spooky movie that has you watching through your fingers at some points. I was disappointed that there wasn't more use of ghostly manifestations before the end of the movie. It could've been even edgier than it was, and the characters' sometimes strange reactions to deaths among them was a little unsatisfying, but overall, one of the better ghost stories I've seen in a while. Probably better than the original. Worth the price of a matinee and a couple of hours!</fullReview>

The cast is a good blend of relative new comers and established stars; and all of them deliver good performances.

		<fullReview>I'm very keen of horror movies, and movies in which a house plays a major part, always seem to attract me. I loved the new version of "The Haunting" and "13 Ghosts". I had heard good comments about this one, so I was glad when I got the chance to see it. The opening scene was not at all what I expected, but it does set the atmosphere, alright. Then the pace slows a bit, yet before it becomes too slow, it picks up again. Very good performances (Famke Janssen really has proven herself a good actress), and a dark plot, with some unexpected twists, make for a very entertaining, yet somewhat unsettling, evening. The house is filmed very well, seeing it gives you the sensation of being trapped yourself(possible spoiler ahead). Especially the elements of the old asylum, still present in the cellars after more than sixty years, and some still working, were very creepy. This is one I will view again, for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"House on Haunted Hill" is one of the most upsetting experiences I have ever had watching a movie. I went in expecting to be scared and entertained since I had enjoyed the original 1958 version so much. Instead I was grossed-out and thoroughly depressed. I have rarely felt so bad after watching a movie. As opposed to "plot", this film uses gore and disturbing visuals (think NIN's "Closer" video without all that "artistic creativity" stuff) to get its point across. What is the point? Uh.....gore is cool? WHY IS JEFFREY RUSH IN THIS MOVIE? WHY IS PETER GALLAGHER IN THIS MOVIE? HECK, WHY IS TAYE DIGGS IN THIS MOVIE? There are only two good parts in this whole mess: Chris Kattan and the scene where Rush grabs the security guard to reveal that the security guard's face is gone. Awful premise, terrible over-the-top effects, unnecessary violence, and one of the single lamest endings ever makes this film one to avoid like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just love Geoffrey Rush!!! I think he is an amazing actor, he has proved he can do serious drama, comedy, action, and now horror. Go Geoffrey GO!The main reason I watched this at the cinema was due to him being in it, and I must say, I was scared silly!!! It mixes comedy and horror beautifully, and has a tongue in cheek feel to it.Based on the original black and white, this is a far superior film. The original wasn't really a horror, it was more of a mystery as Vincent Price was trying to expose his wife as a would-be killer - but he gets the upper hand! This film however just goes straight into horror territory, and it works!The plot? simple. Rush offers $1 Million to anyone who can survive the night at the infamous 'House on Haunted Hill'. But the guest list is tampered with and some unsuspecting individuals are invited. During the 'gathering', the house locks them all in, so the entire gang have to find a way out, and the only place to open up the house agin? Down a very old, very dark, and very haunted basement/dungeon! The rest is familiar horror territory.This film has some very good moments, some genuine shocks and some great gags. People absolutely hate this film! (my mate sdonovan-2 for one!! check out HIS review!) but if you take it for what it is, it's an enjoyable film with a beautiful cast - Famke Janssen, Ali Larter, Taye Diggs and....well of course Geoffrey!Mind you, when I first saw this, I was on the edge of my seat all the way through, but of course there was the ending - laughable!!! Yep, you might have trouble keeping a straight face, but take it for what it is. I've learnt to accept the ending.You might gasp when I give this film a...9/10 ...but hey, we all have our own tastes, and this film has a lot of sentimental value for me as well, so I'm being SLIGHTLY biased towards this film, but I enjoy it too. Good mindless fun. "Evil loves to party" Oh yeah!!!!!!!!!!!Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awful big time, no silver lining, only dark clouds.For all of those who like to go see horror movies and come out insulted, because one should have never seen it. The Best: Hum.. Nothing.The Worst: Let the Devil come and choose..I'll try to be brief, even because writing this comment gave more work than to the writer himself. The plot (if any) is: an excentric millionaire invites a group of people to stay overnight in an supposedly haunted house, which was also a torturing clinic ran by the spooky bad boy Vannacutt. Somehow the invited guests are not the ones that either Steven Price or his wife Evelyn invited. And, that's it. so much waste of talent for some lame 4 ? line plot. On this last issue on the plot the fact of who invited those guests, it is pretty much obvious that it was some spirit (spooooky) that hacked into Steven's computer. On the other haunted house film this year (the great masterpiece, `The Haunting') it happens something pretty much smart and plausible when Eleanor receives the call, who told her to look in the paper, if not Doctor Marrow? You know in comparison to House on Haunted Hill, the Haunting was definetly more carefully written and thought, not wanting to accomplish some big studio deadline.If you want to know, I'm an enormous movie lover, if seen thousands of movies so far some great and some awfull, bud what happened awkward this year is that two haunted house movies came out this year, and one succeded being the best movie of all time (The Haunting) and the other one of the, if not THE worst movie of all time.(House on Haunted Hill)This House on Haunted Hill is a complete outrage to all of those who see it, it's even more of an outrage, it's an insult. The movie came out, wanting to be a scary and funny giant roller coaster, but it failed big time. Everything here screams third class: the plot, which I' have to say, in this horrific parade is the best thing even though I'm contradicting myself, the plastic fist directing, some of the greatest actors currently, transformed in one of the worst (oddly enough worthy of a Razzie award) and I have no words for the horrible Special effects. It's unacceptable that a movie made 2 years ago, featuring CGI looking like a 1930's movie, visual inconsistences, bad color and editing one dimensional CG shots.. Unexplainable. Famke Janseen, known by her work as a bond girl in Goldeneye and doctor Jean Grey in X-Men, is even so the only one coming out alive of this one, she probably came out with a lot of money, otherwise she wouldn't do this and laughing her brains out each time she sees such a total crap like this movie.Even the great music 'Sweet dream are made of these' was used so so much, at least four times in the movie.And let's not even talk about the scene when they see a lot of blood in the ground alongside Miss Marr's video camera and they say `Oh my God, What is that?', `I have no Idea'!!!!!!!.1 out of 10</fullReview>

More like a 'Milk float ride where the biggest scare come when Mrs Jones from no. 42 answers the door without her dentures in!'.I absolutely adore the cathartic process of being scared witless by films. This one, like the Haunting, failed to deliver. The writers and director failed to take advantage of a wonderful set piece (a rotting labyrinth mental asylum basement), providing only one genuinely frightening moment throughout the 90 minutes (the bit where the woman with the digital camera gets killed).I saw this on DVD with it's extra features, including some deleted scenes which makes the scenes that actually made it seem ethereal. It also showed a trailer of the director's previous film 'Creature', a dire, cheap version of Alien. It does make you wonder how such an obviously untalented director like William Malone got given the job of directing an Oscar winner like Geoffrey Rush. One of life's little mysteries I guess.</fullReview>

It does a magnificent job at scaring your insides out. Unexpected moments and experiences, paranormal things, wild action. Ali Larter and Bridgette Wilson perform almost perfectly. Geoffrey Rush is the perfect actor to play the role he plays, rich and eccentric. This is a perfect movie to watch in the middle of the night, alone, and with the lights turned off.

Even when my friends often tell me "yeah, after an hour I knew that she will kill him and then...", I can only wonder how they knew. But this movie was so predictable that after 20 minutes (!!!), I made an exact prediction about the main plot. I only was wrong with one of the survivors, apart from this, I was totally on the mark. Now how can this be? Maybe it's because this movie uses every bad horror flick cliche existing, including young people marching around in old houses' basements ALONE instead of just waiting together in the lobby.If not for Ali Larter, who looks the more beautiful the more her hair gets in disorder during the movie, this film would have been a total insolence. It still is, but at least you have something to look at when you are male.Another good thing: After the starting sequence full of blood and gore, the splatter elements were mostly left out for the rest of the movie. So at least you don't have to nauseate all evening long...</fullReview>

Moreover, every single "pivotal" incident in the film is accompanied by a detailed verbal explanation; the screenwriter obviously assumed the audience wouldn't otherwise understand.-Second is the ludicrous, laughably bad plot development, including poorly developed characters you'll wish to see bumped off.-Third is the utter predictability, every plot point is telegraphed, leading to an abrupt and inexplicable conclusion.Overall, the film tries to hard to be less tangible and more thrilling than the 1958 version, but succeeds only in being completely hackneyed and an insult to both the original film and the audience's intelligence.* out of ****.P.S.--The remake of the song "Sweet Dreams" contained in the film is equally insulting to its original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an early scene in this remake (of sorts) of the classic Vincent Price horror, Geoffrey Rush's character, a multimillionaire theme park owner, proudly show off his latest attraction: a roller-coaster that fools those brave enough to try it into thinking that the ride is faulty, by sending the speeding car immediately in front of them (which is full of dummies) hurtling off the track.This is dumb in a number of ways: anyone queueing for the ride would see this happen, and the shock element would be lost; no-one would bother riding the coaster more than once (if at all!); and the time needed to put a new fully-loaded 'fake' car into position before each ride would cause massive queueing problems.Yes, the idea sure is dumb?but very effective. And that pretty much sums up the whole film: House on Haunted Hill is very silly, but a whole heap of scary fun.Rush plays Stephen H. Price, a man who has dedicated his life to delivering unbeatable thrills. When Evelyn, his money-grabbing wife (Famke Janssen), asks him to organise her birthday bash at an old abandoned sanitarium with a horrifying past (don't they all?), he has a few surprises up his sleeve for the party-goers.The guests have all been lured to the spooky nut-house with the promise of $1,000,000 if they can survive the night. But with Evelyn planning her own surprises, and an asylum bursting at the seams with pure evil, how many will remain in the morning to collect their prize? With a solid cast, decent direction from William Malone, some weird visual effects guaranteed to freak you out, and plenty of unsettling gore (from makeup FX masters KNB), House on Haunted Hill does what a good horror film should do: scare!Once the initial premise is set up, much of the time is spent following the characters as they wander about the haunted loony-bin, but with such a wonderfully realised and very creepy setting, that's really all that is needed. Grimy corridors lit by flickering lights, blood splashed operating rooms, weird scientific equipment of dubious purpose: this film is packed with so much twisted stuff that one can't help but admire the attention to detail.Only in the final act, when a glut of CGI effects are allowed to flood the screen, does Malone lose control of proceedings somewhat. A shame, because up until then, he was going great guns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the stupidest movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Castle made silly, gimmicky b-grade horror movies that are campy and amusing even today. The idea of remaking one of them with a multi-million dollar budget and C.G.I. effects seems like a stupid thing to do, and sitting through this nonsense only confirms it. It isn't funny, it isn't exciting, it isn't scary, it isn't anything of much really. Geoffrey Rush gives a typically hammy performance in the original Vincent Price role. I personally can't stand the guy so that was a definite stumbling block for me. The beautiful Famke Janssen makes watchable eye candy, but her character and the other supporting losers are one dimensional and completely uninteresting. Even a cameo by horror legend Jeffrey Combs can't save this turkey. A perfect example of the inferiority of current b-grade movies compared to 50s and 60s ones. There's not even ONE laugh or chill to be has in this overblown, tedious waste of time. Rent the original. It may be ridiculous but at least it is entertaining!</fullReview>

And how did the patients come out of their "cells" to attack Vaancut or whatever his name is. And how did they manage to stab 3 (three) 18.9 mm long pencils THROUGH his neck in ONE drive? And then again, the pencils aren't long enough to get all the way through still being able to have a grip on it! By the way, how come there were tv monitors everywehere? Nothing had been changed in it! Why didn't they use the guns? Why didn't they stick together? Don't watch! Bad stuff for kids! (I'm one..) 13 years old. I love Kubrick and Spielberg!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are no real thrills in this movie and the missing storyline leaves you kind of empty and disappointed at the end of the movie. The plot is so weak, that it is not worth calling a horrormovie and the fact there are no boundaries makes it even more lousy. There where so many unexplained things happening (e.g. why is all the "souls" locked in one room?). It seemed like an okay movie at first, when they showed the black/white clips, but after that it went downhill and hit the bottom hard. My overall rating of this movie is lower than "Scream 1+2" and "I know what you did last summer" (and believe me, they rated really low!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When five strangers are mysteriously invited to a party held at a haunted asylum, strange things start to unravel.... and everyone in the audience starts to fall asleep.This movie is everything a movie should not be. It is a horror with no real scary parts in it. It has plenty of gore, and some good special effects, but aside from that, this movie has nothing in its favor. Maybe that's all you need to scare eight year olds and idiots, but for the average viewer, that just isn't going to cut it.The characters are completely one-dimensional and have no motivation for anything they do. They are so undeveloped and stupid, you actually find yourself happy when they are killed. The plot, too, is undeveloped. What could be a great psychological horror falls short when the writer decided to tell nothing about what is happening and why. Why are the patients revolting? Why is the doctor commiting these horrible crimes?Chris Kattan from Saturday Night Live makes an appearance, and this brought my hopes up thinking he would provide some sound comic relief, but instead he spends the whole movie ranting about how "the house is alive," something we have known since the first five minutes.Avoid this movie at all costs, it has enough holes in it to drive a Mack truck through. I gave it two stars instead of one because of one somewhat exciting scene at the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Horror" Of It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen dozens of horror films over the years ranging from the silents through the fifties and some phenomenal examples later on. This is a film that doesn't so much rely on suspense or build-up as it does just throwing in one "scary" thing after another. The sound track never stops and the entire experience is fatiguing. It feels like hearing someone say "boo" time and again for just over an hour and that wears quite thin. There isn't much plot - or need for one - and the actors go through their motions with a gory script that doesn't really go anywhere but does manage a fairly good rehash of William Castle's original (which seems pristine and underplayed next to this). Why was it made would be first question...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that this film is already a remake but i feel that this was a step in the right direction to a truly scary movie, and deserves another shot. You can tell this film was made in the nineties when it was "cool" to remake classic horror films, therefore making the film feel cheap. It seems like it wasn't taken seriously and was a cash in and it sucks because it pulls off a few truly scary moments. Someone needs to remake this again, but with a serious and realistic tone. Make this movie more like a Suspenseful "Puldergust" film, and not like "The Haunting" remake. I wanna poop myself in fear the whole ride, not be scared, laugh at the cheesy acting, get distracted, then get scared again. It just feels not well done at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House on Haunted Hill A Decrepit Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stephen, if you really love me, you'll find a way to drop dead in the next second." -- Evelyn Stockard-Price (Famke Janssen).Of all the cheap horror movies Vincent Price made, one of the silliest had to be William Castle's The House on Haunted Hill, an el cheapo exploitation picture that nevertheless has, in the forty years since its release, become a minor cult classic.And I'll confess this: As a child, watching the thing on a rainy afternoon on TV's "Shock Theater," I just about crapped when actress Carolyn Craig turns around and unexpectedly encounters one of the most horrific makeups I've ever seen, on a character who turns out to be not a ghost, but the caretaker's wife. Just for that scene alone, I wanted to watch the thing when AMC ran it Halloween night, but I didn't get to because I was out watching director William Malone's remake.For those unacquainted with the delicious campiness of the original, Price starred as an eccentric millionaire who invites several guests to spend the night in the reputedly haunted house, promising a big bounty to anyone who makes it through the night -- alive. But the vicious infighting between their host and his wife leads some guests to suspect that the spooky occurrences may be window dressing to camouflage a plot by one spouse (or both) to murder the other.The remake takes essentially the same plot, sets it in an impossibly huge abandoned asylum, and substitutes Geoffrey Rush (Shakespeare in Love), Famke Janssen (Goldeneye), Taye Diggs (The Best Man), Peter Gallagher (American Beauty) and Chris Kattan (A Night at the Roxbury) for Price, Carol Ohmart, Richard Long, Alan Marshal and Elisha Cook, Jr. It also substitutes state of the art computer-generated imagery for Castle's now-laughable "skeleton on a string." The staging and blocking of the film are excellently conceived, as are the spooky sets and props. This must have been an enormously hard -- but fun -- picture for the art department. And the effects, while much less ambitious, are actually much creepier than the more massively budgeted remake of The Haunting -- in fact, I'll go ahead and pronounce Haunted Hill a much more worthwhile remake than that late summer turkey. Rush and Janssen have a grand time hating and scheming against each other, and you care much more about them than you did Liam Neeson and the cast of The Haunting (remake, that is).But I'm not sure you care more about them than you do Vincent Price in the original, or even Elisha Cook, Jr., for that matter.Diggs and Gallagher contribute disastrously little to the proceedings, as do screamers Ali Larter and Bridgette Wilson, two blondies who are so much the same type that I had trouble telling them apart from scene to scene. To give him his due, Kattan's take on the Cook character -- the coward who knows the ghosts are real from the get-go -- comes the closest to getting you to give a hoot. Possibly the worst miscalculation is to have Jeffrey Combs, who delivered sublimely cornball lines in The Re-Animator with such relish, not utter a single word in the film. The screenplay, fairly engaging for a while, runs out of steam at the end and commits the cardinal sin of ending with a wisecrack instead of a scream.I'll grant the remake of The House on Haunted Hill this: It looks and feels a lot more expensive than its modest $20,000,000 budget, and I congratulate it for putting the money up there on the screen where it belongs. It's a goofy, spooky ride that's harmless fun, but there's not a thing in it that creeps me out as much as that cheap makeup on the caretaker's wife from Castle's original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Find yourself a small, bizarre hotel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happened upon this slice and dice horror flick while staying in a sinister David Lynch-like hotel in Milwaukee, called The Knickerbocker. Being the Halloween season, leaves falling and trees getting bare and melancholy at twilight, I found the combination of a creepy old hotel room and this cheesy flick a perfect combination. What made it more surreal for me was the fact that I had stuffed foam earplugs into my ears to block out the noise through the paper thin walls. I watched this remake of House on Haunted Hill without having to endure the undoubtedly stupid dialogue (that was a no- brainer) or the gratuitous scare soundtrack and simply watch the cinematography and the actors faces.I don't think there was much good acting going on, though Geoffrey Rush does well as a creepy lounge-lizard type. I caught a few lines here and there so I got the general drift of the story. Peter Gallagher had entered the downward slop of his iffy career. He is slaughtered horribly at the end which is a fitting end for him. Taye Diggs provides some male sex appeal but has two facial expressions... bewildered and bug-eyed and sexy come-on-baby.The bimbos, for such is what they are, are portrayed by two, count 'em, two busty blondes. One, Ali Larter, seems to have some acting ability, the other Bridgette Wilson, does not. The latter is slaughtered even more horribly than Peter Gallagher, and we don't care.Some bit player has his face bitten off and his head emptied like a broken chocolate Easter egg, and someone named Chris Kattan spends lots of time scarfing down bottles of whisky. He dies oddly, as does the brunette bimbo played by someone named Fanke Janssen. They both get sucked up into some kind of creeping cobweb with tentacles. I think Fanke plays the Evil that inhabits the house but don't hold me to that, I don't care.This flick has absolutely nothing akin to the much-loved Vincent Price version made in 1958 which possesses all the charm of the innocent Rank/Hammer years. This 1999 remake takes place in something that resembles Bat Man's high tech Fritz Lang Castle on top of a Transylvanian craggy peak by the North Sea, but the actors are all glib, vulgar American idiots, excepting Geoffrey Rush though he appears to be trying to be like them in this early film performance before he got famous.The f/x are very good, in their limited way. The cinematography has catchy little weird moments when the film is sped up. The sets are OK but most of the action takes place in a great manner hall with a great big bar alternately with the maze-like basement.The stupid characters keep returning to the same underground mad scientist laboratory where they all get knocked off one by one, except for the black guy, the smart blonde bimbo and Geoffrey Rush who's fate is dropped unceremoniously in to limbo by the script's failure to come to a proper ending. Could the dim-witted producers have truly envisioned a sequel? Who cares.I'll never see this entertaining time-waster again unless I stumble upon it at future Halloween AMC festivals. So grab a bottle of gin, rent a room at a creepy urban hotel in a second tier American Northern industrial city on a wet, dark autumn night and have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as horror remakes go i was not at all impressed by this film. From the repetition of the song "sweet dreams" by Marylin Manson to the casting and the story it's self really makes this movie a complete waste of an hour and a half. I do admit that i watch it from time to time but i find hardly any enjoyment in it, it's basically a "there's nothing on but this so i guess i'll watch it" kinda flick. I did think however that Geoffery Rush was perfectly cast but as for the rest of them...not so much. I love Chris kattan, but he TOTALLY did not belong in this movie AT ALL. The asylum setting was a nice touch instead of a mansion, added a great creep out value to the story if the story was stuck to. The roller coaster beginning i thought was a waste of 15 mins of film and the ending was just as left off as the original. How the hell did they get off the top of that huge building? Jump into the ocean? doubtful. And the whole black blob evil thing? OK, sure. The weak attempts to had original aspects into this film i thought ruined it even more and the whole "the ghosts are connected to the guests thing" completely turned me off to altogether. To make my point, the 58' version had the potential to be even better when remade but sadly enough like most remakes it always ends in disaster like this movie.</fullReview>

One wonders what if Robert Downey Jr. had been cast as the owner and how creatively fun the movie could have been. The killings seem to sputter in their ultimate demise. The psychological plot twist with the some of the killings was intriguing and helpful to spur the movie along, but ultimately not put to the greatest use. The horror elements were more slap shots, like in a comedy where one-liners are thrown in, but in this case, the overall impact was dissipated as the concentration of the consistency of the storyline was thrown in so many different directions. Even the lost sympathy/horror affect where temporarily the evil attempts at tempting those remaining to stay was just superficially passed over. Unlike THE CELL (2000) or DARK WATER (2005) or more currently, 1408 (2007), the special effects and the slick undertone of atmospherics just never came together throughout the movie. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill was an exceptionally good movie. The thing is i liked it, but, it just wasn't really a haunted house. The part when the glass shattered and fell on the floor was really good and pretty haunted. But then when they entered the basement or whatever it is called, it was more like a laboratory, a hospital in ruins. It just wasn't really appealing. Anyway they were all stuck down in the basement more over an hour. Sure things happened, but they were'nt in a haunted place. The original movie was in an old creepy house. Haunted stuff happened there and more creepy and spooky things occurred. But in the new movie, it was in a brand new house with lots of fashion in it. So it wasn't really haunted. The back story was pretty good, but didn't need to keep on reminding us about it. So in my opinion the beginning and end was ,pretty good, but the middle was not very appareling to me.

		<shortDescription>Scary? Yeah, Right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be quite frank with you, I'm not really into horror movies at all. Though I wasn't held at gunpoint to see this movie, but I was persuaded by my friends instead. Let's get straight to the point by saying, that "The House on Haunted Hill" isn't remotely scary at all. In fact it is less scary than entering a haunted mansion at an amusement park. In fact if anyone wishes for me to see this movie again, you better pay me $1 million, because I just won't do it.Now that I got that out of the way, let me break it down by examining the plot. Five guests have to spend one night in a burned down, condemned mental hospital in order to earn a quick million. If anything should happen to the guests, the money would be split among the survivors. The sole aspect that freaked me out was that it was set in a condemned sanitarium.And even that was not entirely convincing. I wasn't expecting Oscar-winning performances here, but the acting was purely banal, with the exception of Geoffrey Rush, who always cashes in terrific performances. Even though Chris Kattan was right up there with the other moving mannequins, he at least had some humorous lines. Scary doesn't describe my feelings about the movie, uncomfortable is the right word. Many elements of the movie that I found distracting is that since the house brings all the mental patients together under one leader, why are they not inflicting pain on each other as well? Also why does the ghostly monster has to break down doors and floors in order to get to the heroes and yet the mortals get thrown through walls. It also bugs me that they must walk into a person's office when they're lost, especially since they know where it is and in spite of a few of them being killed along the way. And finally, with only a little time left to collect their cash winning prizes, the guests decide to make up their own quest by attempting to escape the house instead. With these nuances I am convinced that those who have not seen it, are actually doing themselves a favor. I wanted at least the phantom-like monster to be scary as well, but that didn't happen either. In the end I was utterly exhausted and very frustrated by the whole, movie. Those who've seen it, tell those who never saw "House on Haunted Hill" to avoid it all costs. It wasn't scary or satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First thing you need to do is leave all expectations of a remake of the 1959 Vincent Price classic outside, when you check into this House on Haunted Hill. The original was a game of wits between characters in a claustrophobic setting; this one plays out more like a monster movie.It really resembles Rose Red and an earlier flick, House that Dripped Blood, with the house itself seeming to breathe a life of its own, so maybe the Dripped Blood title would have been more accurate. Only the sinister funeral march of hearses at the beginning, and the challenge/reward offered by the host has been kept intact (although there's an added useless scene preceding this at an amusement park, for whatever reason).The host sports a thin Vincent Price mustache, and is named Mr. Price (get it, yuk yuk). At that point, forget about the plot of the original. The film throws in characters from everywhere, dark tunnels, electro-shock therapy, spinning carousels, psychotic episodes, the screaming teens cliché (except they're 30-somethings, a little old to be teens), people using that same old thoroughly exhausted curse word because the ingenious script can't think of anything more original, and some monsters that pop in and out in poorly blue-tinted cinematography where you can hardly see what's going on. The acting is pretty awful, especially by the screeching Harry Potter look-alike.To be fair, it should be said that there are some isolated moments of horror scares. The movie can be entertaining as cheap, cinematic fast food, the kind you see on Sci-Fi channel on weekend afternoons. However, there are also parts where it's about as scary as that 3 Stooges episode where Curley is chased around a haunted house by a balloon with a grinning face. Keep expectations low, and you can have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horrible ending killed the plot!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie after my friend told me about it and claimed it was really good. Well I cant say that me and her share the same view on it that is for sure. When I picked up this movie I was under the assumption that it was going to be a little frightening and over-all a good time...uhhhh no. The first hour or so was GREAT but, then came the end and ruined the whole experience. How they could ruin such a good plot line with a special FX black cloud blob (I am sorry for the terrible description, but I call them as I see them)is beyond me.I give this movie a 4/10, due to the plot being butchered by a uneffective and painful ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it has James Marsters, it's gotta be pretty good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, for starters, lets just say that overall it was a good movie. I was truly horrifying (especially if you're watching it in a dark room in the middle of the night...). Also, the only reason I watched it was to see James Marsters. He's only in it for like five minutes, but all in all I enjoy watching him perform. I liked the part with the electric thing too. I thought Mrs. Price was truly dead. And to think all along that that freaky guy with the glasses was in on the plot to take the money and run. I also liked the part with that freaky guy with the glasses was in that thing and his head was chopped off. Gross. And that's about it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies I've ever seen and in my collection!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I work at a local haunted house in Middle TN just outside of Nashville, this is my 6th year with the haunted house and I'm one of the doctor's in the medical scenes. I was introduced to the 1999 remake and bought it just out of curiosity. I decided to adopt the Vannacutt character as my own. Anyone who has ever seen the movie, knows it as well as I, and comes through the h.h. knows the character and I play it well. His movements, his appearance, everything about him I've got down to a science.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone that loves horror! Currently I'm attempting to build a "saturation chamber" like the one in the movie, call me crazy, but that's how much I love the movie! I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, so GO BUY IT ALREADY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pritchett was almost the only thing worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing worth seeing in this movie is Chris Kattan's performance as Watson Pritchett. His character was hilarious to watch in his matter-of-fact manner, and Chris Kattan delivered his lines with the sarcastic tone and movements needed. The other actors and their characters were mediocre at most, not for their performance but the lines they used. Every line and conversation sounded like it came from a poorly made video game and the reactions to everything that happens within the film was extremely unrealistic. The effects were great through the movie then became extremely low budget at the end when "the darkness" is released. I went in expecting a good horror movie, and came out laughing: both at Pritchett's incredibly hilarious manner and at how disappointing the movie ended up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Malone, to me, is one of the most imaginative minds currently working in the horror genre, who, unfortunately, has not earned the success of the other extraordinary horror directors out there in Hollywood. This film may have a considerable cult following, but he is not at the level of, say, William Castle, the director of the original House film. This, however, is his magnum opus and he has managed to create a truly terrifying horror film, paying a great homage to its predecessor.Obviously, this remake doesn't quite match up to its predecessor. But regardless, Malone creates a surprisingly creepy horror film that really captivates the atmosphere and feel of William Castle's original film, the atmosphere of the fun houses in amusement parks we all enjoyed as a kid.Basically, here's the back story: Dr. Richard Benjamin Vannacutt, a sadistic brute of a doctor is the director of the critically celebrated, R.B. Vannacutt Asylum for the Criminally Insane. He performs bizarre experiments on the patients taken into his care, including vivisection and electroshock treatment. In late 1931, the patients grow tired of the tyranny of Vannacutt, so they burn the asylum to the ground, cutting the doctor apart in the midst. All but 5 of the staff's doctors die in the fire (these probably would have been different statistics, but Vannacutt locked the entire place down using the asylum's security system- "if he was gonna die, they were all gonna die"). Enter Stephen Price 60 years later, the owner of Price Amusement Parks. He is a bitter, cynical, sarcastic man - the point of blame for these traits seem to be his unwilling marriage to his wife, Evelyn Stockhard-Price, the kind of bitch you just love to hate. After seeing a documentary on Dr. Vannacutt, Evelyn decides to have her upcoming birthday party in the recently-restored House. Price tries to change her mind, but she's set with it. Price invites a group of money-hungry guests to the party - for some strange reason, the people who arrive are an absolute different group of strangers. Why, why? The reasons, of course, are revealed later on in the film. Things get interesting as the lock-down mechanism (last used when the place burned down) mysteriously activates again.The acting is superb. Geoffrey Rush has a great time with his role as Steven Price, the bitingly sarcastic Greg House-like billionaire, whose role is an obvious tribute to Vincent Price, the actor of the original millionaire in the 1959 edition. Famke Jannseen delivers a great performance as his equally sarcastic and sadistic wife. Comedian Chris Kattan pulls off the broken-down, tittering, Watson Pritchett, the seemingly cursed owner of the Asylum who's accepted his inevitable death ("I'd love to get laid before I died"). The rest of the supporting cast (Peter Gallagher as Dr. Blackburn, Taye Diggs as Eddie Baker, Ali Larter as Sara Wolfe, and Bridgette Wilson as super-bitch Melissa Marr) delivers decent performances, and, even though their characters are not the most interesting, deliver their fair share of good one-liners. And, Jeffrey Combs, who definitely deserves a mention, plays the demented Dr. Richard Benjamin Vannacutt - the director of the asylum that started all the trouble in the first place. Combs, though having at the most, 5 minutes of screen time, pulls the role of Vannacutt off terrifyingly well. The way that he walks around the house scared the hell out of me, and the look of his character in itself is dominating.The asylum is excellently designed. The exterior is so bizarre and offbeat, it looks like a lighthouse-turned-prison. Rather normal during the day, but terrifying at night. And the interior itself is beautiful in a very dark sense - I really wouldn't mind living there were it not for it being haunted by Vannacutt and the rest.So why doesn't this movie work? Well, the ending has to do with most of this. The screenwriter, Dick Beebe, creates a very intense buildup in his story throughout the first hour/half-hour of his film, and I was really expecting a final twist in the plot for the ending. Unfortunately, Mr. Beebe throws away his efforts and concludes the film by throwing in some evil spirit and killing off the remaining characters in a very overplayed fashion. It's a shame, considering what the finale could have been.To say the least, this is worth a rental. There are some truly entertaining and terrifying scenes in this remake (Price's trip in the Saturation Chamber, to name one). Even if there are some cheesy moments and lines, and some overplayed CGI at the end, you'll have fun watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>enjoyed this...a splendid film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a shockingly great. For B horror movie entertainment and with a sterling silver cast that includes geoffrey rush, famke, ali and bridgette...I was taken by my knickers! When I first read about the conglomerate known as Dark Castle productions, I was a bit skeptical. Granted, Joel Silver, Walter Hill and Zemeckis are wonderful producers and did a terrific job with Tales from the Crypt, I was a nervous reading that their intention was to remake classic William Castle films. Wouldn't really call william an auteur, but his rigging the theatres with gadgets a plenty to scare the audience was brilliant. From the opening scene of this re-envisioning, I knew that we were in for a real treat. For the sheer effect of seeing the ever-beautiful lisa loeb and spike himself...I was impressed. The rest of the film was icing on a glorious cake. Not a second is wasted through this endeavor. True to the tagline...Evil Loves to Party. This film rocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake is one of the better remake of a horror film 30 years its senior and does a damn fine job at scaring the hell out of you if you have never seen it. The back story is great and if you're a video game fan they use some of this back story for the hit title "The Suffering" but that aside. I say watch it by yourself, enjoy the score, the great acting from such stars as Geoffrey Rush, Peter Gallagher, Taye Diggs, Ali Larter, and Famke Jansen. This is one thrill ride that no one should be without. I'm even surprised to say that the acting job by Chris Kattan is decent attempt at serious acting and shouldn't be scoffed at. Geoffrey Rush's sarcastic role as well as great chemistry with Famke Jansen give a great sense of believability. Great CG effects and a surprise ending give everyone a run for their money. So who will survive?? Who will receive their 1 million? Just sit back, relax, and step into hell with some of the most colorful characters in any horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was pretty cool, even though there was hardly no gore Any all in it. I watched this movie when it first came out on video around the same time as the haunting(which I thought stunk) and I have watched it several times since. The acting in the film is great that takes it a long way and I like dr vandacutt now being in that house you would really be in a bad situation. geoffrey rush delivered a great performance as steven price and I really liked chris kattan as prichett he played that role great as well. I wouldn't say everyone would like this one as much as I do but the scene where price is put into the crazy chamber is really cool, I liked this movie and would recommend it to you as at least a rental, it's gotta be alright coming from a guy who bashes almost any new horror movie that comes out, overall pretty good and well paced, Great acting, enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this on video when it was first released and I was very impressed by both the acting and the spookily reminiscent of Marilyn Mansons "Beautiful People" video ghostly effects. Laugh-out-loud one liners and stomach curdling horror all combined to make this a great movie experience for me.It has a fantastic score which sets the tone of the film. Geoffery Rush is superbly camp and hammy as the millionaire Roller-coaster park owner Stephen Price ( a nod to Vincent in the 1959 original?) The eerily spooky soundtrack especially when the characters are first witness to the "House" is very fitting and adds to the experience. I've made this a quick review as others have already revealed the bulk of the storyline...and one to just say "Go rent the DVD NOW! The only downside is the ending which just seems to be completely inconclusive...but I wont reveal why. Overall....excellent!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Now this may sound crazy, but hear me out..." (*SPLUTCH!!!*)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw the original HoHH, but I don't think I need to after seeing this 'bigger, louder and brighter' remake. A basic, familiar horror plot (a haunted house and a millionaire who offers big money to a group of people who successfully spend the night) is punched up by some interesting twists and turns (the millionaire is a special effects wizard...but the house gets away from him and starts doing its own thing) and some ugly shifts in the group dynamics (two of the people in the group are not who they claim to be) and some truly nasty bits of violence and shocking brutality.One of the interesting things I noticed about this is that Rick Bota was director of photography. Bota went on to direct two of the "Hellraiser" sequels, and many of the same SFX, images, lighting and camera treatments from this movie appear there also...although you could argue that most of the really disturbing effects for both were borrowed from "Jacob's Ladder". But the house truly is a creepy, upsetting place, and many of the special effects and dream images are best viewed with your eyes screwed tightly shut and covered with both hands.One thing that distinguishes HoHH from more typical horror fare is that most of the cast can really act. In fact, Geoffrey Rush is better than a movie like this really deserves - he has so much fun with his role that you can't help but enjoy the zest of his character. Famke Janssen, Taye Diggs and Chris Kattan are fine as well, working hard to invest their roles with energy and humanity, and the dialog doesn't really insult the viewers intelligence. It's even fairly humorous (in a nasty, snotty way, of course).But this isn't a classic. As other reviewers have mentioned, the movie winds up for a big finish, but can't quite pull it off, and the last 10-15 minutes sputter and creak and generally leave the viewer feeling a little flat. But I still like it, and recommend it to anyone who likes a nice, mean horror film that doesn't skimp on the gore and shock, or anyone who can really appreciate what an actor like Rush brings to a movie like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just so horrible to watch. Nothing makes since. Oh, a mad scientist, Dr. Richard Benjamin Vannacutt(Jeffrey Combs) and his band of sick nurses and doctors go around killing the Price's, Baker, Blackburn, Pritchett, Wolfe, Marr and Schecter. What's so entertaining about watching ghosts kill others anyways? I wouldn't recommend this, Thirteen Ghosts and Haunted House to anyone as it and the ones above do not make since. Neither does Rainbow or the Scary Movie series. Trust me, you'll have a much better time watching something with class. Something that has a zing and pop to it.Neither does it make an entertaining film for your children as it gives nightmares, visions and horrific emotional stress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was either 12, and frankly... it scared the s**t out of me! {but that was the TV version}. Three years later, over spring break, I decided to rent the movie, to see if I was still scared by it. Let me make this perfectly clear... DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE! {watch the TV version} The TV version had a mystique... which made the movie much more enjoyable to watch. But the "real" version didn't leave it to the imagination like the TV version did, it added to much and ultimately made me feel swindled and disappointed. So save the five dollars and wait 'til it's on AMC, because your more than likely enjoy a Levitra commercial rather than watching Bridgette Wilson being killed by fake wind {not the direct cause, but used as a effect}!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen House on Haunted Hill several times and I own it. This isn't a bad movie but I would not call it scary maybe at the end more suspenseful but that is about it. I study ghosts and spiritual activity along with old Psychiatric Infirmaries. I will give props for the insides of the hospital down in the basement and elctro shock therapy rooms. Real state hospitals never looked like that on the outside nor on the inside entrance. This is suppose to be a psychiatric hospital why do the "Prices" get a luxury room like that and one other thing Psych Hosptials never had a lock down just for the purpose of in case of a fire people would burn to death. The experiments are true and I think that was captured perfectly. Thanks for the movie but not scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool place for a party!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really cool movie, but falls short in a couple of places. Famke Janssen is my favourite actress ever, and i think part of the reason i like this film so much is because she seems so enthusiastic, she looks like she is having fun all the way through, and her interaction with the other characters / actors, Geoffrey Rush who plays her husband in particular, is awesome. What lets the film down is some inconsistencies, the main one being Ali Later's character, who originally believed to be "Jennifer Jenzin" is actually "Sara Wolfe", but after she tells her story to just one of the characters, everyone afterwards calls her by her actual name even though they were not made aware of her situation. (also, i think the deleted scenes with Jennifer Jenzin and Sara Wolfe should have been left in). But overall, a solid horror movie, with lots of frights, and an appearance by singer Lisa Loeb (Can't go wrong there, Loeb is awesome). I haven't seen the original, so cannot compare.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally - a film with ghosts in it that's actually worth watching (at least minus the final 15-20 minutes or so).The story is nothing new - a couple of people trapped in a house with some savage spirits - but HoHH is also fun to watch. When Rush's character looks like, and has the same last name as Vincent Price (who was the lead in the original), you sort of get the idea that the film is done with tongue in cheek. And since most of the film is pretty funny, I have no problem with that. It's not really scary, but it's sufficiently gory to motivate the horror label.The acting is also above average for this kind of film, and the characters aren't complete retards, which helps a lot. However, it's evident that the budget wasn't very high, as is painfully obvious in the far from impressive effects towards the end of the film. Why you would want to go with a poorly animated dark shadow as the film's nemesis when you're already firmly set in an abandoned madhouse filled with ghosts, remains a mystery to me.With a bigger budget, a longer runtime, and more of the ghosts, this film could have been truly great. As it is now, it's only about two thirds there, but still much better than Haunting, Thir13en Ghosts, and Ghost Ship put together. [6/10]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though we don't really celebrate Halloween over here, each year we get a bucket load of horror movies to watch. Some of those movies are often not well known, but very interesting to watch. House on Haunted Hill looked very promising, but failed.I know this was a remake of a movie from 1959. I haven't seen the original version, but we all know what horror movies from that period are like. Not scary, but sure worth a watch. Knowing this, I hoped the remake from 1999 would be good, but it failed because the director tried too hard to make this movie scary. He used too many special effects, too obvious plot twists and not really a top cast. No, this movie really didn't give me what I was expecting. From time to time it made me laugh, but I don't think that was what the director had in mind. I give it a 5/10. Watch it if you haven't got anything better to do, but don't expect a good horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too good, but good enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill is unfortunately about as obvious as its title. While it certainly has a few good tricks, there's really not much of value as things quickly turn from witty thrills to a standard slasher flick. The show's detailed setup amounts to almost nothing fairly quickly, and seems like a waste of time.The first of many mistakes with this film is ghosts changing the information in Price's painfully simple guest list early in the show. Corny barely describes it as we watch the cursor move across the screen in his word processor and the words retype themselves. Very old Internet hacking ghosts, that work in real time on the screen. No technical knowledge: check.The next big problem is the films quick reliance on blood, torture, screams and CGI to pull it's horror. Rather than go for the witty scare at it does quite well during the initial theme park scene, things fall into the standard gore fest for much of the film. There's enough gore that after I had watched it, I wished I hadn't. I still get a slight queezy feeling in my stomach just thinking about it. Personally, I don't find torture and buckets of blood good film making or entertaining.Despite the flaws, there's a halfway decent action/horror movie in here, and a few witty scenes. If you watch it with the right atmosphere it can be mildly scary and unnerving. More just for the sheer amount of gore than for any real scares though. It's far from a movie I'd buy, but it's probably worth watching once if your a fan of such films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had its moments and was for the most part okay. It was certainly better than "The Haunting". It has these people who must spend the night in an old asylum to collect some money. Unfortunately, it isn't long till something unseen begins to stalk our friends. Strange images appear on the monitor, people are seemingly killed. Then the movie ends exactly the same way as "The Haunting" did. Here comes the black smoke cgi ghost to mess up the rest of the flick. Why they thought they should do this is beyond me, I never saw the original, but I am positive nothing like that happened in it. So instead of maybe having the creepy doctor on monitor being seen we see a shapeless blob, who when it kills it is nothing really special at all. The ending kills any momentum that had occurred during the rest of the movie. Well I didn't care for the husband wife plot point all that much either. I would have preferred it being everyone slowly stalked and killed by the evil in the house with no cgi used.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the biggest strike against this movie is the fact that the legendary Vincent Price brought the millionaire to life in the original. Very few actors have a presence and aura on screen to match Vincent. To say that that's a shortcoming on the part of Geoffrey Rush would be unfair; however, I couldn't help but watch and remember Vincent and miss that larger than life blend of eeriness and elegance that only Price could summon.Strike #2 comes that the film being remade is a William Castle film, which I have to admit is one of the more interesting horror entries I've seen and one of the more effective of the older horror flock. So with the law of remakes and the law of filling-in-a-legend's-shoes, this film sucks by default before anyone sees it. Strike #3, why must everything tie in on itself? One of my pet peeves of horror ? everything has to come back to one common theme, one common event, all these strangers have to have something in common . . . and does anyone really care about that gimmick anymore (which admittingly was cool 35 years ago)? Can't a house be haunted because ghosts/demons/monsters don't like house guests? Sadly that would be a refreshing break through in the trend of `Oh my God, we all knew each other in another life on another planet in a galaxy far far away a long time ago!' Just leave the plot alone guys . . . don't go too far past the premise or else you'll hurt yourselves.Despite the films notable shortcomings, House on Haunted Hill wins points for being one of the most stylish horror flicks of '99 with some genuinely interesting and well executed concepts. In terms of frame composition, Malone is an artist with excellent taste in photography, set-design, lighting--he brings talented crew to create these haunting imagery. So where the plot leaves holes, Malone fills in the gaps with style . . . this would be outdone (in both departments) with FearDotCom where the plot gets even thinner and the visuals more impressive. As far as the score, goes though, I have to give the better to House on Haunted Hill by Don Davis. Wonderful score and probably the most diverse horror score available on CD. This is still my favorite music by Don Davis. I'm actually pretty fond of Malone's films; however, not enough to go out and purchase the DVD. I'm glad I rented them. I have a feeling he'll go far if he ever finds a screenplay whose writing is as solid as his visuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look at the box cover of this movie and tell me without laughing that this movie looks good! This awful remake of the classic film of the same name was full of unrealistic bullsh*t that made me want to kill whoever made it. What is irritating about this movie is how desensitized the characters are to horrifying experiences they go through in this movie. I suppose seeing nightmarish visions is an everyday thing for this cast of a**holes. I knew that this movie would suck after the soundtrack started up with the emotionally distraught Marilyn Manson's pathetic remake of the beautiful Annie Lennox (Eurythmics) song, "Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I already have done a review of this here. But I watched it again yesterday on tape (and coincidentally it showed up on TV last night.) Which prompted this thought: What makes this remake watchable? Strong acting and interesting characterization. Some great sets. A fair amount of gore. Some really interesting sequences, such as the falling glass near the beginning and the ghostly replay in the reporter's camcorder LCD of the terrible events from nearly 70 years before. What hurts it? A terrible ending with a truly terrible monster, and perhaps a little too much wandering around the "basement" throughout. Also, the scene with Rush in the "mental restoration" chamber midway through goes on far too long. It also would have been a lot better to have four or five characters survive and somehow get back out through the front door. It's worth seeing just for the interplay between Geoffrey Rush and Famke J.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, since 1999, i've watched alot of movies, and alot of which are alot better than this one. Horror movies too, i might add. (The Ring and 28 Days Later included)But when i watched this in the theaters during it's release, it got to me...i thought it was just the big screen feel, but it got to me, and i loved every minute of it. (Although the end is a little hoaky)A great way to waste 90 minutes of your life...it'd be an even better way to do so, if they would've left in all the deleted scenes that are on the dvd...INCLUDING the alternate ending **shakes fists**All in all though, it got me a bit jumpy at points, and i'll never forget the scene that appears on the camera when Vannacutt is his "ghost walk" and then he does that rapid shake thingy **love my words** and all of a sudden he's got a knife, and he's looking at the camera. BOOM...right there...that technique had me...i loved it.I recommend this for someone who's looking for some fun...not someone who's looking for the next Exorcist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Castle's classic 1958 film "House on Haunted Hill" finally hits the screens for modern audiences, starring Geoffrey Rush as an eccentric theme park tycoon who throws a birthday bash for his wife inside Dr. Vanacutt's Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane, offering a group of strangers a MILLION DOLLARS EACH if they can stay alive and spend the night inside the walls of the house on haunted hill. And boy, it's going to be a freakin' long night, I'll tell you...This is probably the scariest flick I've ever had the pleasure of watching, (but, admittedly, I'm not a big horror-movie fan). It's a classic haunted house story, with plenty of crazy special f/x and dialogue for today's modern moviegoers. Infinitely better than the '58 version, this one sees Rush playing the role that Vincent Price perfected forty years ago. Rush does a commendable job capturing the spirit and wit of mogule Steven Price (named as an ode to Vincent). Famke Jansson (better known as "Goldeneye"'s Xenia Onatopp) as Mr. Price's twisted, bitchy wife.And standing out amongst the rest of the cast is "Saturday Night Live"'s Chris Kattan, playing Watson Pritchett. Kattan undoubtedly steals the show and lends a heaping dose of dark humour inside the grimy, blood-stained walls of the haunted house...Yeah, the fun slowly degenerates into your average thriller: the guests all split up (because, as we all know, travelling through a treacherous haunted house ALONE is always safer), and each gets their share of nasty little shocks. The old asylum's mysterious "lockdown" mechanism suddenly kicks into action and traps the guests in the house. MAJOR "Uh-oh!"The majority of the film takes place in the basement of the asylum, dishing up a truly disturbing experience as the cast traverse through the dark, maze-like hallways, amidst old wheelchairs and hospital equipment. Oh! And did I mention that the place is haunted? Yeah, it seems that in the forty's, awful experiments were done on helpless patients by the demented Dr. Vanacutt, experiments that brought human torture to new depths of depravity...But hey, it's all part of the fun, isn't it?A modern classic of terror. Be sure to pick up 1999's "House on Haunted Hill", as it will give you plenty of chills, thrills, scares --- and, trust me, more than enough truly disturbing back-story to freak you out for quite some time...Have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good, House on Haunted Hill is a film directed by William Malone, in which Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush) and its evil wife Evelyn are passing for a series of difficulties in its marriage and relation as couple.The birthday of Evelyn herself is near and thanks to a program of television, she decided to organize its party in a true haunted house,a mental house, where in another time a mad doctor lived, that go crazy and tortured to the death to its patients which were revealed and they carried him to the death.The legend counts that the ghosts continue patrolling for the place and frightening. As killing as well.Price and Evelyn together with a list of "unexpected" guests arrived at the mansion to pass an unforgettable night, where the human perversions emanated to the light and the ghosts wants revenge. Ghosts don´t forgate the past.A film frankly to pass the while with a very noticeable soundtrack and with a competent cast but wasted that it removes the film (Geoffrey Rush, A overreacted Famke Janssen, Peter Gallagher, Ali Larter, Chris Kattan, Taye Diggs, Bridgette Wilson, Jeffrey Combs, James, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Masters and Peter Graves).Effective the film is overloaded and exist narrative gaps at the same time full of incoherencies: as that of the Russian mountain (harmful).But I insist Malone directs with innocence its movie that well could be resolved in a different way. The effects could be less noisy and but concrete.In short badly remake of an old one film of the director William Castle.But with 2 or 3 moments very well put that let us to pass an pop-corn moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say this is one of the worst films I have seen recently.Is it scary? No more so than an episode of Scooby-Doo. Is it well acted? Well I lied to the above question, the acting is extremely frightening. Woeful in fact.I found out after seeing this on DVD that it is a remake of a Vincent Price "classic" from 1959. After seeing it you will note that the acting is just as 'hammy' as the original.The 1959 original may have worked as a Horror, and the old style Vincent Price way of acting was; in its day somewhat Sinister. But to expect film goers to be frightened by the same thing today, albeit with some half-ars*d CGI effects thrown in, is a tad naive. In my opinion of course.Avoid. No. Dont even consider it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie runs somewhere between The Omen &amp; Evil Dead. (original) Perhaps the closest I'll get to say the video game Phantasmagoria than anything else. It's so hard to find a good haunted house story. Course this particular is based on something 50 years ago. So it's not totally original. Everyone seems to be interested in the laughable Scream movies. That are totally screamless. Mostly cause they were intended to be a parody in the first place.Today most good haunted house games inhibit themselves within video games. And they do it quite well. Jeckall &amp; Hyde looks interesting... and who can forget The Undying. I swear... hell will freeze over before I go near that game again.And as this dvd gives you insight on the original Haunted Hill... it's amazing that we don't have shock treatment at todays scary movies. :( What a buzz that would be. Nope. someone probably would sue. :(So if yer in for a good little haunted house scare this is a treat for you. Enjoy. And that Ali Larter is something...7/10 Quality: 9/10 the choreography on this movie is stunning!!!!!Entertainment: 9/10Replayable: 4/10 Hey it's a horror film.

A group of strangers are invited to the party and offered one million dollars if they can survive the night, but unfortunately for all those involved the house is much more than it seems. A good cast, setup, and special effects make for some effective moments, but the film is relentlessly cruel, has repellent characters, and too often resorts to gratuitous violence to hide its lack of scares, making this just another slasher exercise. Lead actor Rush is clearly having fun though. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie for a haunted house flick, a theme that can easily be considered to have been done to death. Instead, it shows influences all the way from the original, through Jacob's Ladder to Se7en. What makes this movie work is that one, the main character is a horror industry person, secondly, the house was used for gruesome purposes in the thirties, and the antagonism between the main characters. You're constantly thinking which of the three directions the plot will lead to, which elevates it beyond the haunted house theme. It's literally a thrill ride from beginning to end, with attractive actors (Famke Janssen, Tay Diggs, Ali Carter, Bridgette Wilson), and small cameos for Richard Marsters (Spike in Buffy) and Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, From Beyond, Necronomicon and many other horror movies) you can identify with. What's even better, is that the cast isn't the usual horror movie brainless teens running around. The roller coaster ride at the beginning of the movie is a classic! For a movie in this genre, it's very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House On Haunted Hill is about six strangers, all very different from each-other, who get invited by a strange millionaire to come and spend a night at a supposedly 'Haunted House' on the hill which has a terrible past behind it. The only catch is they will each get the money if they survive the night, which means they have to stay alive. Thinking this is a good way to get some money, they all decide to go ahead with it. They don't really believe any of the stories involving the house. When they all arrive in the house though, they realise they shouldn't of come, as weird things start to happen and people begin to die one by one. The cast here including, Geoffrey Rush, Chris Kattan, Peter Gallagher, Ali Larter and a small cameo by the brilliant Lisa Loeb are all really good here.When House On Haunted Hill was first released in the cinema over here in February 2000, it was one of the most anticipated movies for me of that year, and even though it was different to what I expected, (That's what you get when you can't wait to see a movie so much.) it was still a great movie, even if it was a little weird, especially at the beginning. The ending was also a little strange too, but it was a different ending from your usual horror movies. The House On Haunted Hill DVD is also really great. This movie is not the best Ghost/Haunted House movie around, but it's definitely good enough. I give House On Haunted Hill a 7-8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER WARNING*When i first heard about this movie, i was expecting it to be really bad, since the critics had trashed it like crazy when it first came out. It was actually not as bad as i had expected. The story is actually decent, i thought it was interesting (and funny) how the rich guy and his wife were always fighting, although later on in the movie it gets a bit graphic and a lot less humorous. Speaking of gore, this movie has a lot of it. I can honestly say that i've watched Saving Private Ryan, the Patriot, Braveheart, and a bunch of other movies which contain a decent amount of graphic violence, but never once did i ever feel sick watching any of them. This movie is by far the only exception. The beginning scene alone was pretty graphic, although not the worst of the movie. The most disturbing scene in my opinion would have to be when the group of people find that girl's camera and watch it, and you know the rest. Also, the beheading scene, very graphic, and when the rich guy opens the cabinet to find the girl's body parts, oh and the ending, the very end after the credits roll, scared the heck out of me. Anyway, it was a good movie, a little bit too bloody in my opinion, but good non-theless. Go see it..9/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this movie is perhaps the best horror I've seen. 1st hour and 20 minutes gives me really the creeps. I like the part where woman sees the doctor and nurses through her digi-cam. BUT WHAT's WITH THE ENDING? It reminds me of "The Faculty" with lousy computer animation. This movie turns to mainstream-horror and it DOES NOT FIT in this kind of cool movie. If ending would have used only ghosts like Vannacutt, then this movie would be THE BEST!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOOSELY Based on the Original !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SOME SPOILERS MIGHT BE INCLUDED: I have seen the original movie this film is based on and it is a timely and enjoyable if not dated tour de force that makes no mention of sanitariums, violence or living house. Supposedly a remake of the William Castle classic, this movie takes the concept of that movie - five strangers trapped in a haunted house by a millionaire - and deviates so far from that flick that it has to be considered it's own movie. Creativity runs rampant in this script as it invokes themes of suspicion, paranoia, deceit, claustrophobia and psycho imagery wrapped in visions of sadism, depravity and mutilation. Much of it is nothing more than one big gore fest more than likely to offend true fans of the supernatural. I love the ghosts for what I see of them, but the black thing is a concoction of someone's bad dream as it tries to validate the claims of the house's owner: "It's alive, and she's p***** off !" claims Chris Kattan in one of the only really good characters in this film. It's such a departure from his wasted talent on SNL. Bridgette Wilson doesn't get to really shine and Geoffrey Rush really invokes and pulls off a great Vincent Price take that falls close to the master's expert style of terror as he acts as host for this band of non-descripts and the movie watcher. Lisa Loeb (looking uncannily like Meighan Desmond, Discord of "Hercules") has a temporary spot in the opening set-up, but she really needed to come to the house. As much as they changed the original script, her role could have been expanded. Chris Kattan emotes better talent here than any of his wasted roles on SNL evoking the atmosphere of another great haunted house classic, "The Legend of Hell House." Bridgette Wilson is cast in a great role, but very quickly becomes a throwaway character and Famke Janssen broods and mulls her way through the movie as if she's looking more for a way out of the movie itself, and the other characters are only halfway interesting enough to make anyone care what happens to them. The special effects style of the ghosts is excellent and lends more than an eerie trait to the movie as a whole, but the movie falls apart at the end as the plot gets even more ridiculous and the situation even more far-fetched. Most of the effects aren't as scary as you would find in a genuine haunted house with a paranormal history, but they do illicit the same reactions as one might get from a carnival/funland haunted house. While not everyone will be attracted to this movie, I think it has enough redeeming values to keep it from being a total disappointment. Personally, I recommend it to fans of intelligent horror, but the brain-dead fans who only care for splatter, gore and vomit won't appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a TRIP!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually the 2nd movie I have seen featuring the haunted house on the hill. The first I saw was not the original, nope, it was the other film released the same year as this one, The Haunting. That film had a supposedly much better cast and crew and of course a bigger budget whereas this film had not. The Haunting became quite a box ? office success but failed to really be creepy. This one however, doing pretty good at the box - office for a film with that ?small' a budget, really creeped me out. The first 5 minutes of this film alone were much more terrifying than the whole 112 minutes of the Haunting. The fact that I even had forgotten that I pretty much enjoyed The Haunting by now says enough, whereas I think this film is much more memorable and can be seen more than one time.I mentioned this film was very creepy, well creepy does not mean brutal or gory in this film, OK throughout the film there are some gory and bloody images but it all is not too bloody, although I expected it to be very bloody and gory. However this film succeeds in being very psychologically ?heavy' in a way, for you never get a chance to rest or to breathe normally. You always are captured in that spooky house, not knowing what will happen next.The unpredictability of this movie is, what makes it so good and it originates in the beginning of the movie, when we see Theme Park mogul Price (Geoffrey Rush) pull off some stunts that makes us believe he can pull off anything with a straight face. Later on, as we see the rivalry between him and his wife (Famke Janssen) and their equal love for games and the hate for each other you are destined to always keep asking yourself: ?Is it the house or is it them?', for it could be all staged, when at the same time it could not be.For all of that, the tension in the film, the unpredictability, the creepiness and even the good jokes that are delivered at quite some points in the movie I must thank everybody who worked on this movie: the set decorator, for the creepy house and the interior; the director for the way he handled the camera and the colors and the music; the composer, for creating a good score; Marilyn Manson, for contributing his creepy cover of Sweet Dreams and the actors and actresses for being believable (especially Rush and Janssen , who had of course the roundest characters and who right down nailed them onto the screen).As far as Famke Janssen is concerned, she, of course, is no stranger to horror films, she also starred in Lord of Illusions, Deep Rising, The Faculty and now in House on Haunted Hill. Lord of Illusions I found not so good, but that was before Janssen got world famous as James Bond's opponent Xenia Onatopp in Goldeneye. After that she almost only made good movies. I did not like City of Industry and The Gingerbread Man that much but never have I seen a bad Famke Janssen movie. If you like horror and Famke I can recommend Deep Rising to you very much and you also might want to check out The Faculty. If you just like Famke, see Rounders and X ? Men, in my opinion the best film of 2000 (I just regret the fact that Famke's character was too flat and that she didn't get a chance to play what she does best ? a villain). In this one however she got the chance and as always she played the backstabbing and sexy femme fatale perfectly.Well I must say a few more things before this ends, first of all, that Geoffrey Rush is much better in this film, than he was in Shakespeare in Love (congratulations for that choice Mr.Rush). Further I must congratulate Ali Larter for starring in 2 great horror films in 2 consecutive years (Final Destination ROCKS ? where the hell is part 2???) and I must wish Famke Janssen good luck in picking such well scripted movies as she has done lately (do not participate in Terminator 3 as the bad Terminator if the script is not good Mrs.Janssen!!!)BIG 8 (8,4) out of 10 (just to state that I liked this one better than The Haunting and this one had, unlike The Haunting, NO flaw AT ALL</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's really not bad. A film that I'm sure horror fans will love and is good to watch on a late night.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** and 1/2 stars out of ****There's a tendency for films to come out in pairs. In 1997, two volcano disaster films were released, and in 1998, there were two asteroid/comet disaster films. In 2000, it's two Mars movies, and last year it was two haunted house films (on a sidenote, there were also two films about kids who could see dead people). This is one is definitely far superior to the dud that was The Haunting. Yes, the script is rather trashy and you don't give a damn about most of the characters, but it's also a creepy film that's far scarier than you might think.Geoffrey Rush plays Vincent Price, an amusement park owner who loves to scare people. He's also married to the young and beautiful Evelyn (Famke Janssen), whose birthday is coming up. Both of them absolutely despise each other and they even have plots to kill each other.Of course, ever the fan of supposedly haunted houses, Evelyn wants her birthday party in the abandoned Vannacut Institution, which is believed to be haunted by the good doctor himself along with all his psychotic patients. Invitations are sent, but different people, a total of five, arrive, ranging from an ex-baseball player (Taye Diggs) to a woman posing as her boss (Ali Larter). They have no idea why they're here, but they're made an offer by Price. They will each receive a million dollars if they can survive the night. Obviously, all with the excetpion of the caretaker (Chris Kattan) are intrigued. The caretaker tries to leave, but at night the building automatically closes down, shutting everyone inside for the night.Then the strange things start happening. People start to disappear, making everyone nervous and jumpy. Though Price believes it's one of them doing all of this, the others start to believe the place might actually be haunted, and that it wants their souls, too.House on Haunted Hill doesn't have a hint of originality, it's rather trashy script will turn a lot of viewers away, but seen from the right mood, you could have fun with the movie. It's certainly never dull, and there are plenty of good jump-in-your seat shocks. Just because the other haunted house film was a disaster doesn't mean you should turn your back on this one.Oh, it's by no means a perfect movie. The performances are competent enough for this sort of film, but nothing spectacular. Geoffrey Rush and Chris Kattan ham it up in appropriately humorous roles. Everybody else is mostly nonexistent or there as fodder.Director William Malone does a good job with a 20 million dollar budget, as the film's effects are actually better than it's 80 million dollar counterpart (you know, the other haunted house flick). But the scares and suspense start to decline in the last 5 minutes, when it turns into an effects-filled finale. Granted, it's still a far better ending than The Haunting, but it's not as scary or as fun as the material that came before it.On another sidenote, I have heard about some more scenes after the credits. Since I had no idea about this, I had left the theater before I could see it. Out of curiosity, what exactly does happen after the credits?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geoffrey Rush does horror?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that this is MY opinion. Some people will agree, some people won't. I have to say I loved this movie. This movie put Geoffrey Rush on my list of all time favorite actors. House on Haunted Hill is a loose remake of the 1958 HOHH, directed by William Castle and starring the great Vincent Price. When I first heard about the remake, and heard that Geoffrey Rush was replacing Vincent Price, I couldn't believe it. Having seen the original, and being a huge fan of Vincent Price, I didn't think I would like this movie at all, but I loved it. One of the best things about it is the fact that they made the movie somewhat original. Instead of a shot for shot remake (i.e Psycho, which was terrible) they took a different turn, gave it a somewhat different plot, and made the house actually haunted(or is it?). Geoffrey Rush is fantastic. I saw him in Elizabeth and Les Miserables after I saw this movie, and couldn't believe it was the same person. He looks like Vincent Price, he steals the scenes like Vincent Price, but He doesn't IMITATE Vincent Price, which would have been easy to do. In the original, Vincent Price played the role very elegant and classy, while Geoffrey Rush plays him more seedy, and kind of like a little kid doing something very naughty (and loving it!). He manages to do exactly what Vincent Price did in the original. He makes you like the role in the first few minutes you see him. I also can't forget the performances of Famke Janssen, Taye Diggs, Ali Larter, Bridgette Wilson, Peter Gallagher, and Chris Kattan. They were also equally great in their roles. One thing that does upset me is the constant slams about the computer graphics. While they were not the best, I found them somewhat believable. SpoilerIf I worried about how the computer effects looked in every movie I saw, then portions of Jurassic Park 1 and 2, Titanic, Deep Blue Sea, and lots of other movies would not have impressed me as much as they did. While a collage of smoky ghosts chasing the surviving members of the cast around isn't the most scary thing in the world, what else could they have done? Dressed up a member of the Crew in a white sheet and had him walk around yelling "Boo"? This movie is definitely a must see. Rent it today! I give it a Ten out of Ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill was a brilliant piece of horror. It combined gore, terror, suspense, and most of all- humor in the best places. The cast alone is an assembled line of geniuses- first of we have Ali Larter- the star and hottie of "Final Destination" and then we have my personal favorite actress Famkee Jenseen (From "The Faculty", "X-Men", and "Deep Rising"). Though Famkee is not the star, it is clear she is the one who makes this film awesome. After seeing this movie, I had nightmares of the man with the spinning head (that is NOT a spoiler) ((Vanacit))for weeks. HOHH is better than the original tenfold. I really really enjoyed every bit of it except for...SPOILER AHEADThe horribly stupid and contrived ending. The only way that they could have made that ending good was by saying that since the man (The Ghost that saves them) was not killed by the House Ghost (Vanacut), he was just a ghost and helpful.Jacob Doner</fullReview>

This guy basically scares the crap out of people for a living, and that's why he thinks that the House on Haunted Hill would be a perfect place to host his wife's birthday party. The big question through the movie is this: Is the house alive? Well? Is it? See it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"House on Haunted Hill" is just a downright weird movie. The scenes that are supposed to be scary, really are. The acting, however, is horrible! There isn't much life in any of the characters, and the love scenes are tacked-on and out of place. The whole idea of the plot is insane, but I guess that's just what the movie is. This movie seemed like it would be a low-quality copy off of "The Haunting" but the plots are different. The whole idea is this: In the 30's, an evil doctor ran an insane asylum and did evil testing on the patients. The patients one night break out and kill all of the staff, but five people. Just before the doctor is killed though, he throws the switch and locks everyone in to die in the burning crazy house with mental patients. Only the five surviving staff members escape with their lives. All of this is the beginning, and I must admit, it was quite scary. The rest of the plot is a party being thrown at the house in the 90's and scary things happening. Although the images are bizarre and scary, the rest of the movie is stupid and tacky. I can't quite find where this movie lies on a scale from one to ten. I guess at about a five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the horror movies that were endlessly churned out since the Scream phenomenon, this may be the worst. The special effects by today's standards are laughable looking more like a cartoon than a movie. The acting is below average but since the script they have to work with is so lousy one would expect this this. The characters are for the most part pretty despicable. You actually wish that most of them would die! One of the babes from "I Know What...", Bridgett Wilson is in this movie but she must have changed her mind after they started filming since she is hardly in the film at all. Famke Jansen is beautiful but she can do much better than this. How Peter Gallagher and Geoffrey Rush got suckered into this, I cannot understand.

Pay close attention to the added sound effects in the background and look at the amazing atmosphere. It's like something from Resident Evil or Silent Hill. This is the kind of atmosphere I've been looking for in a movie. It could have been half an hour longer. Characters should have been developed and there was room for it too be creepier. Lose the computer generated ending, add more ghosts and more Jeffrey Combs and you would have a perfect haunted house movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have never been more scared</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, by far, the best horror movie I have ever seen. I have never been more scared in a movie. I screamed more than once (don't laugh, so did my friend), and I jumped ever few minutes. House on Haunted Hill packs thrills and chills into each and every scene. I'm not a big fan of gore, but my friend Amanda, whom I brought to the movie with me, says that a horror movie is just not scary without blood. However, we both loved it. Amanda claims that it is better than every Child's Play movie combined, along with most of the other horror movies that she has seen. The two of us are not the type of people to get scared watching movies, but we shook the entire ride home (and several days afterward). Along with the horror, SNL player Chris Kattan adds just the right amount of comedy. I am a big fan of his, and I wondered a little at him being the "comic relief" (a la Jar Jar). But he plays the part incredibly well, and he does a wonderful job of giving the movie life. Taye Diggs, break out star of the year, also did amazing work on his character. In closing, this movie is great, and I highly recommend it. (A+ 10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just when you thought horror was dead...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along comes HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL. Okay, it might not be a remake, but it certainly lives up to the high expectations of the Vincent Price original. Not only does this film have some of the all-out creepiest scenes in cinematic history, but it's also chock full of gore, comedy, and surprisingly good acting. As a fan of both Jeffrey Combs and Geoffrey Rush, I was most pleased with their excellent performances. However, I was shocked to find myself laughing at Chris Kattan, who I'm sure many of us have had a death wish for since NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY came out. Well, regardless, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is a fantastic new horror film that should become an instant hit. Perhaps the re-emergence of actually creepy horror will strike a nerve in Hollywood and we fans could see more films like this. Congrats to Dark Castle Entertainment for an amazing first film! I hope all the others are just as good!</fullReview>

This was one of my favorite Saturday afternoon movies of the early 60's, with Vincent Price dripping sauve menance and skeletons on wires flying about the theatre. Great stuff. This adaptation by William Castle's daughter Terry. The, uhm, acting, is common and laboured. Most of the players seem quite unhappy. Does someone have negatives of Geoff Rush during naughty things with lifestock ? What in the world was an Academy Award winner doing in this clunker ? Peter Gallagher should stick to singing . Sure, Taye Diggs injected some pizzaz but he was fighting a losing battle. Chris Kattan ? Chris Kattan ? I won't sully the females by mentioning their names but they're all savvy enough to have known better. Whatever story there was probably ended up on the editing room floor. There's no explanation for lots of things which in this case is just as well. And that ENDING ! It dosen't scream sequel. It screams KILL ME !</fullReview>

We and others in the theater wondered how many different ways you see people run down the same hallways from different directions. The final form of the creature was a "vapor with faces" effect used at least as far back at Raiders of the Lost Ark. It moved so fast and yet so slow. Seriously, how stupid could these people be to accept an invite to a closed, reportedly haunted hospital? Really Glad we saw it during twilight prices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little worried about this movies because it's a new production company and their first movies tend to be a little on the not so great side (point in case..BATS) but this one was backed by (and maybe owned by I don't know) Warner's so they had a budget to work with and access to all the other good things a major studio offers. Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It had good acting and the script was great. The special effects were well done overall and it had plenty of good jumpy moments to put you on the edge of your seat. Overall a pretty good first attempt. And a nice little twist that at least I wasn't expecting (and I'll be most that are honest weren't either). Anyway, this is a movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of "House On Haunted Hill" is an exceptionally well conceived and executed film, with fine production by Robert Zemeckis&amp; Co., sharp direction by William Malone (an ardent fan of the 1958 original), taut scripting by Malone and Dick Beebe (Beebe who incidentally, coscripted the original), and good performances by the cast. Peter Graves in a cameo appearance. HOHH 1999 more or less adheres to the original with some differences; first and foremost it being more serious, with its horrid backstory and graphic violence. This film is definitely not recommended for viewing by small children and those prone to nightmares, as there are lots of disturbing, sadistic scenes; with some profanity and brief nudity also. Not since "Silence Of The Lambs" and the "Hellraiser Series" have I been subjected to so many shocking, gruesome images. Another difference, a fresh and interesting twist, is that the house is not a house per se, but rather a former mental institution converted into living quarters. This variation is integral to understanding and supporting the backstory. The film has a brisk pace with little dragging "expository lumps"; the crucial backstory is seamlessly insinuated into the current events. The soundtrack is on the mark, conveying the sinister tone and atmosphere with modern rock music tracks and even an "Addams Family" type composition thrown in to pay a brief tribute to the more light-hearted tone of the original film. The characters are standard stereotypes, but are played well within the context, and by mid-story, it is predictable as to who exactly will survive the ordeal, not that that is seriously distracting. The standouts of the show are former Oscar Winner, Geoffrey Rush (in the Vincent Price role) as Steven Price, and Famke Janssen as Evelyn, as his Significant Other. Both deliver great performances, both individually and in tandem, as they remain faithful to the Vincent Price/Carol Ohmart adversarial relationship: some delicious/vicious, catty dialogue between the twosome. I can't say that I snickered and grinned that much throughout this remake, like I did during the original, but I don't think that was ever part of Malone's intention. (He had stated in pre-production that he "wanted to capture the flavor of the original, while putting it into a modern context".) In conclusion, while HOHH 1999 certainly remains indebted to the 1958 original, it can stand firmly upon its own merits, and undoubtedly will achieve a reputation as one of the better horror films of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batter than new Haunting, but lackluster when compared to Castle's original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great little film compared to the other horror films of the day, but still missing something classic. I appreciate the tip of the hat to Vincent Price in Rush's character and found the cast to be most admirable, with a few exceptions. Kattan was not bad, but seemed ill suited to the role of the care taker. Why didn't we see someone with some more horror type believability in this role, perhaps Chris Walken or Steve Buschemi. Still, the movie does squirm along efficiently enough to delight an audience, though I cannot help but question why they had to include the gore which makes the unknown known and detracts from the overall psychological horror (the best type of horror) of the film. So, its not as good as the original William Castle classic with Vincent Price, but it is a better remake than that of The Haunting was. Overall, William Castle must be very happy since both of his works were excellently redone, even if some of it was excellent due to eye candy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoy being scared out of your wits then this is the film for you! Just in time for Halloween comes The House on Haunted Hill. Its the story of five people lured to a spooky old house by the possibility of becoming rich over night, literally. You see, whoever survives the night gets an equal share of the $5,000,000 in cash put up by millionaire trickster Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush). But surviving the night is not going to be as easy as it sounds. The house itself has other plans for our guests, like an unpleasant ending. The visual imagery reminded me a lot of Event Horizon and the chills come a mile a minute, so hang on to your hats and prepare to have the pants scared off of you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What made this movie so funny was the fact that there were so many useless twists and turns. It appeared that the director was trying to create a chaotic atmosphere but merely succeeded in creating an idiotic one.Throughout the movie, the question that is constantly posed is: Is this house really haunted or is someone trying to scare everyone away in order to get the multi-million dollar prize for staying the night? By the end of the movie, I really didn't care about the prize or the characters making it out alive. I was rooting for the house to win.What is truly disturbing about this movie though is the continual depiction of dead naked women (some whole and some decapitated or mutilated). This just wasn't necessary.Poorly done special effects in addition to lousy renditions of ghosts (The ghost of the doctor walks like a robot and shakes his head) add to the cheese factor of this movie. I wasn't even remotely scared by the "haunted" house.All in all, a truly pathetic attempt at a Halloween scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chiller remake with grisly horror, genuine chills and shocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This William Castle's remake starts October 11th 1931, Los Angeles.A conflagration of biblical proportions incinerates nearly everything and everyone inside what was one the City of Angels most celebrated medical facility, The Vannacutt Institute for the Criminally Insane. But the secret this inferno burned free was far more frightening that any picture Hollywood could produce. A sanitarium of slaughter supervised by a surgeon gone mad ,Richard Benjamin Vannacutt(Jeffrey Combs). Little known today but likely the most prolific mass- murderer of this century. He out-butchered Bundy. He made Manson look meek. And the site of this carnage still exists today, restored almost to its original state. But it has yet to be inhabited, because some say the spirits of Vannacutt and his victims still live within the walls of the House on Haunted hill. The magnate named Price(Geoffrey Rush) arranges shocks guests(Taye Diggs,Ali Larter, Peter Gallagher,Chris Kattan,Bridgette Wilson) along with his spouse(Famke Janssen). He invites them to the haunted former insane asylum and offers them a million of dollars if they can stick it out for the complete night. But soon supernatural creepiness begins frightening the hosts.This eerie tale packs horror, grisly killings and lots of blood and gore. It's silly but good fun and with an excessive use of computer generator FX and special make-up in charge of Robert Kurtzman, Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero(appears a cameo as roller-coaster technician). However I miss the first version's gimmicks,such as a full-size skeleton(dubbed Emergo) leap from the screen and descend on cinema-goers along a hidden wire. The film is lavishly produced by Dark Castle , production specialized on terror genre and in charge of Joel Silver,Robert Zemeckis and Gilbert Adler. The motion picture is professionally directed, without originality by William Malone. He's a TV episodes director(Masters of horror,Tales of crypt, Freddy's nightmares) and occasionally cinema director(Feardot.com,Creature). Rating: Acceptable and passable but with no novelty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will fill a little over an hour and a half, and is fitfully entertaining. Geoffrey Rush is always fun to watch. However ...... while the 1959 version was not exactly nightmare material, this updating and remake reminds me of a cross between an alternative music video and a video game (_Silent Hill_, anyone?). This is not exactly a surprise since Hollywood seems capable of little else when attempting to make a genre film, especially in the genre of horror.Although I should be used to this by now (?) it never fails to tick me off: in the past few years there have been numerous remakes of what were for the most part "B" pictures. The remake of _The Haunting_ is a possibly even more disgusting exception: a CGI-lousy remake of a perfectly terrifying and high-class 1963 rendition of a classic horror novel by Shirley Jackson. The "B" remakes, which include this film, _13 Ghosts_ (another William Castle gimmicker) and _House of Wax_ (Paris Hilton counts as CGI, I think) positively destroy the fun spirit of the originals and are absolutely not scary in the slightest. What is the point, apart from moneymaking? Perhaps it's me. There is one "remake" I absolutely love: John Carpenter's _The Thing_. Perhaps it's that I not only admire the grotesque nature of the images in that film, but the fact that the effects are all prosthetic/mechanical keeps it more ... real somehow. CGI just has a particular "look" to me &amp; that robs from the fright. And CGI used for cheap shock effects will, yes, make me jump but that is not the same thing as really scaring. True fright, which I'm having a difficult time trying to define, I'm sorry, is far more complex.This remake of _House on Haunted Hill_ has the "head-whipping-around" effects from _Jacob's Ladder_ &amp; _The X-Files_, and actually uses the spotlight-through-big-fans lighting effect (over and over and over) that _Saturday Night Live_ made so popular in its musical spots, etc.Oh, and there are no characters in this film. Just video game characters. Truly an awful experience, one to inspire even more hatred for the American entertainment machine.UPDATE: Despite the negativity of the above review, I have to say that director Malone's entry in the _Masters of Horror_ series, "The Fair-Haired Child," is really quite good. See it!</fullReview>

I like the references to Poltergeist, Haunting, but they should of stayed subtle with the little demons hiding in the hallways ready to leap out and scream. A certain scene with one of the characters dying scared the living daylights out of me. Seriously. I was pale. The movie was so lame up until that particular part that I opened my eyes to watch. The only death scene that has ever scared me that bad. Imagine, walking around a really big dark house only to turn and see a little skeleton looming in an off hallway. I have to say, for that scene i give it a 8/10. Horror violence-8/10, for one scene. The rest are cheesy Comedy-10/10 Hilarious Entertainment-11/10 The look is fab. Watch it.

After going there, they realize that they have no option but to spend , and the rest of it is about what they encounter there and whether they are able to survive it at all.The story is meaningless, there's only grotesque stuff and bad language, poor acting, not at all scary costumes.The good - maybe Taye Diggs' and Geoffrey Rush's acting.

		<fullReview>You'd figure that a horror movie set inside a haunted house would have some decent production design to it. After all, even the heavily lambasted 1999 remake of The Haunting had an impressive look going for it. William Malone's remake of House on Haunted Hill, however, is filmed in dreary colors and murky darkness, and takes place on some of the grungiest and unpleasant looking set-pieces, that it just might be the ugliest looking horror movie of 1999. It's also lazily written, laughably unscary, and downright boring to boot. The story here is pretty much the same as in the original: An amusement park impresario (Geoffry Rush) invites six strangers to the titular house in celebration of his no good wife's (Famke Janssen) birthday. Each guest will win a million dollars if they stay the night and, of course, "if you survive the night". The movie opens up with a glaring lapse in logic, as not only do we see a video tape display real footage of graphic violence, nudity, and rape on public television, but a few seconds later, we learn that the tape was supposedly burned in a fire, so how the producers got ahold of the footage is anyone's guess. It gets better. The Janssen character plays a trick on her husband that involves her receiving electroshock therapy until she's dead. The plot is too convoluted to get into here, and is too ridiculous for me to care to explain it all. The images in this movie make no sense, as there are flashes of Hellraiser type demons that don't seem to fit in the movie at all, and the characters are the same batch of horror movie doofuses who are constantly make dumb decisions, like wandering through the house alone. There is one pretty nifty sequence involving a camcorder picking up some ghostly activity, but other than that, House on Haunted Hill is dull, dead in the water, and easily one of the very worst movies of 1999.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wise's "the haunting" has still no contenders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's glaring when the characters scream "the house is alive" "the house is killing us" "the house has invited us" .The beginning borrows also from Agatha Christie's "And then there were none" when the guests arrive,invited by someone they do not know .The best ,IMHO,is to be found in the first sequences at the fair :the scenes on the roller-coaster are really breathtaking especially if you see them in a movie theater.Black humor is also very good.But the scenes in the haunted house are routine.The unexpected twists are too numerous ,too far-fetched, to generate terror.However the last picture is a good trick .It makes one think that the movie would have been better if it had been treated like a real spoof on horror movies.Something like the "Terror Tower" in Disney World ,Florida.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep it short and sweet-- you will probably enjoy this movie more if you have seen and enjoyed the 50's Vincent Price version. A few "inside" jokes, along with similar situations updated for the 1999 viewing crowd make for mutual appreciation of both versions. Altogether, several notches above the typical remake of this genre, so even those who have not seen the 50's version can still appreciate it. If you view it more as a fun movie which is sometimes more tongue-in-cheek than a serious shocker, you'll probably like it. Acting is generally credible by all, although, as some have mentioned, the ending may leave some slightly disappointed. Then again. most of the fun of this movie is not really in the finale, but in the "getting there" part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on haunted hill has to be the scariest film i have ever seen. I first saw it two years ago and it still scares me. I don't get scared very easily but this is one of 3 films which does. My favourite scene was the one where Price has a nightmare about all those ghosts. That really scared me especially when he's in the water and that naked lady screams with her face all twisted. I screamed on that bit. I'd have to say house on haunted hill is more sick than scary because of all the blood and weird movements doctor vanicutt and his patients do. I think all the actors were fantastic like geoffrey rush, Ali Larter and Famke but i also liked the guy who played Prichard as well.TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T SCARED BY THIS FILM WHAT EXACTLY DOES SCARE YOU. MAYBE ITS BECAUSE OF THE ATMOSPHERE YOU WERE IN AT THE TIME OR MAYBE YOUR JUST UNSCAREABLE.This film freaked me out totally and all my friends agree.I give this film 9/10 because it was ssooooooooooo scary!!!</fullReview>

It is probably the only thing that lets the film down. Well other than the dialogue which encompases a whole of 72 swear words (Yes I have counted) and can sometimes play tricks on your mind.That being said I believe whole heartedly that it is a good film when you can get your head around things its more enjoyable. Also I think that William Malone's belief of "filling the plot wholes with your own imagination" did not very much work with him.My advice to people is that it is well worth watching if your a gore merchant, a fan or just like horror movies. Over analyzing it just makes one frustrated. Keep it simple and it's low brow but funny antics and homage to the original give it a unique spin. I can honestly say its my own favourite horror movie. Watch it a few times (And it usually does take a few times to watch it before it appeals) Then see if you like it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one great horror flick! I borrowed this on DVD from a friend and didnt expect much. The first scene is inside an asylum, where the inmates go all crazy one night. The madness ends with the asylum burning down. The ghosts of the head doctor echoes into the future and the house becomes haunted. The house is the entire setting in this film, after a small introduction of the most important characters. I was alone watching this and when Marilyn Manson's version of Sweet Dreams thundered out of my home cienema speakers I got the feeling this wasnt an ordinary horror movie. And I was right. A party is taking place in the house, but people who shouldnt be there in the first place shows up. They are all connected somehow and they start dying... The movie is scary - for real, which is unsual today. It will keep you on the edge until the last 10 minutes when the true evil inside the house shows up. If the movie would have ended in the manner it begins and progresses it would have left me very uneasy. It didn't and I am somehow happy for that.If you want to scare yourslelf and bring someone with you into the horror, watch this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Horror means Stupid???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this lame attempt to scare, i finally became convinced that, for movie makers these days, horror is equal to stupid, pointless, brainless and disgusting. I wonder why we, the lovers of the horror genre, has to put up with so many atrocities, just for the sake of getting a good old fashioned scare. Nevertheless, not even this remakes will make it so far.I always loved horror films, and being scared with them is something delightful and really amazing. Unfortunately, there are only a few (very very few) movies that can actually scare us. The most are overrated blockbusters with no script, sense or acting. The way producers decided to scare their public is definetely not the addecuate one, cause with all their plot twists, they only get laughs and pointings on how ridiculous their movies can turn out.House on the haunting hill is a perfect example on this. The beginning is actually frightening, with the mental patients going nuts and killing all the doctors and the nurses. The idea of spending a night on a haunted house could have done it perfectly, but uncanny they decided to put up a annoying couple as the hosts. All their marriage problem is so stupid and boring.After that, all came downhill, to finally turn up in a strange black mist that we should identificate as the evilness itself. I consider that fact very dissapointing and surprisingly childish! But to that point I was so undescriptable teased by boredom, that all I ever wanted from it was to end up soon.I don't know how long this movie was, but it looked to me like it took an eternity to end. If you're looking for chills and thrills, you won't find them on the house on the hauted hill. If you really want to see something scary , try looking on that tedious Annie movie instead, at least that would be more frightening than this one!</fullReview>

It's scary, it's riveting and it's well made. I'm not at all a fan of slasher/gore flicks (the 30's Universal classics are more in my line of horror films). Aside from the gratuitous foul language (I retired from the U.S. Navy, and even we don't punctuate every sentence with the word "f*ck"), I enjoy the movie more every time I watch it.

		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers I saw this movie in the summer of two thousand at a graduation party I went to. It was a dark, stormy night and we decided we would order something from PaperView and decided to get House On Haunted Hill. The opening credits were a little freaky, along with the very beginning and my friends kept poking me in the back! I still wasn't afraid though. No movies in the history of my life have scared me, besides It and Nightmare On Elm Street. Maybe that's because I watched them when I was a very young child and now I have a resistance to it .. Hmm .. Anyway, the beginning was kind of unexpected by me, considering the fact that I didn't know the difference between The Haunting and House On Haunted Hill. I thought that House On Haunted Hill was The Haunting, until I realized that this was very gory (I saw the original version of The Haunting). I am a rabid fan of horror movies and this was definitely a favorite. Going through some of the comments .. the only complaint I happen to agree with was the fact that the ending wasn't as good as it could have been, but it was still excellent. Geoffrey Rush, Peter Gallagher, Famke Janssen, and Chris Kattan happen to be some of my favorite actors. The romance between Ali Larter's character and Taye Diggs really didn't catch my affection. Instead, I preferred the couple that were in spite of each other, Famke Janssen and Geoffrey Rush. I also enjoyed Chris Kattan's character a great deal, along with Peter Gallagher's. I didn't like Bridgette Wilson much in the film, but she didn't bother me much, since she was dead early in the movie. I wish Geoffrey Rush's character didn't die, along with Chris Kattan's. Oh well. It's a great movie, see it if you like horror movies. And remember everyone, evil loves to party.</fullReview>

However, my opinion has changed once I saw the DVD. I'm telling you, if you're on the border of whether you like the movie or not, rent the DVD. You can watch the whole movie with the director's commentary talking over it. It's great if you have the patience to watch the movie twice. Watch the regular version once, and then watch the whole thing again listening to the commentary. The detail he went through and the director's vision make it an even greater movie. Scary, wicked, and witty. Plus Chris Kattan is adorable, you just want to hug poor Pritchet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Haunted Hill had great potential. Although it wasn't wasn't able to quite pull it off it's still a very good movie and not just mindless hack and slash.Geoffrey Rush does an outstanding job as Stephen Price, eccentric millionaire owner of a chain of theme parks. Famke Jannsen turns in a good performance as his scheming witch of a wife. Chris Kattan also turns in a surprisingly good performance as the current owner of the "house". The rest of the cast performs their jobs well although none truly stand out.House on Haunted Hill has some great moments and shows flashes of brilliance. The scenes that show the ghosts from the 30s are great and I wish there had been more of those and in the end that they were more the focus as the evil within the house. Unfortunately the director chose to go a different route and this is why the film is just another horror movie on the rental shelf. The visuals are truly outstanding and there are enough good performances and flashes of brilliance to justify seeing this movie more than once.</fullReview>

Just briefly, since most of the followers didn't manage in pulling much originality into their attempts. Try watching titles such as "Urban legends" and you get the picture. "House on Haunted Hill" and "Final Destination", however are better attempts in this category; as "FD" has an intriguing idea that it does use well enough (catch the original ending on DVD!), "House..." drops the "plots/subplots/depth" crate on the parking lot and goes straight ahead for chills and thrills - and what's best, not shying out on gool old bloody KNB latex-and-corn syrup-FX! The plot involves a small group of people trying to survive a night in an old insane asylum inhabited by especially mean ghosts. Almost on par with "Evil Dead" - even on the scary side.

		<fullReview>Some films just don't stand a chance. Gus Van Sant didn't have a chance when he remade Psycho; either he could have remade it almost exactly the same, and be accused of redundancy, or make it different and have it panned as "nothing compared to the original" simply because it just wasn't an exact remake of the original.The House on Haunted Hill didn't stand much of a chance either. The original was great, but great FOR ITS TIME. Watching it now the dialogue seems awful and the acting campy, but then that's half the fun. So this remake could have gone two ways - keep the spirit of the original (deliberately bad dialogue, not much characterisation, campy as hell) and face the rap for that, or make it a popular 90s film (self-reverential dialogue, gore galore, teen model cast, special effects galore) and incur the wrath of the post-"Blair Witch" affictionados. The makers decided to try and strike a balance here, and seem to have reaped the worst of both whirlwinds.The thing is, it doesn't really deserve it. For the first hour it works great - the atmosphere is great, the tension palatable and the humour clever. But then it looks like a different writer got hold of it, the effects kick into overdrive, and the dialogue is 80% screaming. I guess we've been spoilt by films like "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Sixth Sense" but this just doesn't lie well and lets the audience off the fear hook. Maybe if we hadn't been spoilt in the first hour, there would have been better reviews. As is, it's got some decent shlock value but feels like either the filmmakers or the studio tampered badly with the last section. Such a shame!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a bit of a mess. We are given a series of clues as to why everything is happening, then motivation is thrown out the window. The movie begins at an asylum where the evil staff perform surgeries without anesthetic. The loonies take over the place and perform their own version of these "surgeries" on the staff. Now we move into modern times. A special effects whiz, amusement park producer decides to invite people to the House on Haunted Hill for his wife's birthday party (When you meet the two of them you have to ask why he would even consider doing anything for her). The people have no idea why they are there and an eerie set up takes place. Once they are nicely locked in, we get ready for the rest of the film to make some sense, to have some order to it. Wrong. The remainder is a mess of unanswered questions down to why the house has become evil (I know, horrible things were done there). What no one ever answers is why. Somehow these people have some connection with the house and the evil that goes on there, but things happen so randomly and with so little preparation that we are left to sort of make up the reasons. This could have been done decently with a little effort but instead it's just a big gore fest with a group of people we couldn't care less about and supernatural elements that are pretty picked for their startling nature. First rule, even if we don't like the person, put a human face on him or her. Don't bother with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is this, after all? A remake in color of a schlock 45-year-old Vincent Price horror movie (not very good to begin with) featuring a cavalcade of special effects.A rich amusement park owner (Geoffrey Rush) and his cynical -- and very tall -- wife (Famke Jannsen) invite half a dozen friends to spend the night in a deserted mansion. The survivors will get a millions bucks apiece. It's particularly spooky because the building is an ex psychiatric hospital in which the owner years ago went mad and slaughtered staff and patients alike. "He out-Mansoned Manson," Peter Graves gravely intones on television.At first it all seems like a kind of practical joke perpetrated by Rush, who is given to scary stunts. But then the house evidently locks itself up and nobody can get out or communicate with the outside, not even Rush. Most of the lights go out and the guests are stuck with the task of poking around with flashlights in the crumbling rooms filled with electronic torture devices.It all gets pretty routine. One of the guests is a black guy and I figured him for an early victim. It's that kind of movie. There is a vat of what looks like boiling blood and someone gets pulled into it. There is a fake death. Falling skylights. Two pistols are produced, one supposedly loaded with blanks. And all kinds of mysterious goings on, go on. And -- and -- zzzzzzz.I can see where someone might enjoy this. It's all formulaic, and it's a remake to begin with. But it's creepy, scary, and bloody enough to satisfy the kinds of desires generated in a mind whose cinematic faculty is as empty as a ping pong ball.Want some spooky movies that embody some originality? If you haven't seen any of Val Lewton's tiny masterpieces -- "The Cat People" or "I Walked With a Zombie" -- or, say, "The Haunting" or "Carnival of Souls," try them instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part, "House on Haunted Hill" is your average horror movie: a bunch of people go to a house that has an evil history, weird things happen, and everyone discovers that it's no accident that they all got invited. But Geoffrey Rush as emcee Steven/Stephen Price (his first name gets spelled differently at various times) keeps the movie from getting idiotic. Aside from having the last name Price, he has the same kind of moustache. The other cast members (Taye Diggs, Famke Janssen, Chris Kattan, Peter Gallagher, and Ali Larter) are worthwhile, but Rush carries the movie. Still, I would recommend the original Vincent Price version, just so that you can see what the concept originally was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake is MUCH MUCH better than the original and I must say the actors and actresses were great. I loved the gore too, but when I watched it on VCD I can't get the part when this roller coaster flew off the tracks and suddenly the scene skips to the scene in which there's this *paralyzed* guy. Huh? Still, its a great movie and this is what horror movies should be like!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good as an homage but not really effective as a genre movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the fans this is a nice homage to the movies from the good old days of horror, when actors such as Vincent Price, Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing were at an all time height with the simplistic but atmospheric little genre pieces they appeared in. This movie is a remake of the 1959 movie "House on Haunted Hill", with Vincent Price in the main lead. It combines old fashioned horror with the more modern horror style. This is nice for the fans of the genre but nevertheless the movie never ever really works out as an horror.Modern horror movies featuring lots of special effects are often being bashed but I must say that for this particular movie it does work fine. It's not due to it's special effects that the movie and its horror doesn't work out.Just blame the movie itself for that. It doesn't ever provide itself with some good scare and horror moments, which is also mostly due to the fact that it is often having too much fun with paying tribute to the more older horror movies. It makes the movie often more a fun and entertaining one, rather than a exciting or scary one. It makes the movie watchable but at the same time also yet quite ineffective.The writing just isn't anything too good. The script doesn't provide the movie with any good memorable characters you can also care about and it doesn't offer the movie any excitement. The story does try to put you on the wrong track at times but not all of the twists come as entirely unexpected and some of them also just aren't for the good of the movie.Seems Geoffrey Rush also still had fun playing in this movie though. He often goes over-the-top, in a positive way, since it gives the movie a certain degree of entertainment, which helps to make this movie still a very well watchable one. Other actors such as Famke Janssen and Ali Larter are also present but their play their roles a bit too straight, as if Rush was the only one who understood how to approach his role and play in a movie such as this one. Also Jeffrey Combs plays a small role, which I wished would had been a bit bigger, also since his character is not entirely irrelevant for the story.You can tell that director William Malone likes and understands the genre. All he needs to do now is to make a good and effective genre movie and use his skills and knowledge more wisely, since he certainly does have it all in him. He know has mostly made some quite bad genre movies, of which this one is still one of his better ones and also certainly the best known movie he has done so far.A fun but far from effective genre movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed remake but definitely not a bad one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as remakes go, House on Haunted Hill is neither among the best or worst ones. For me, it sits somewhere in the middle. If I were to say which is better out of this and the original, I'd say the original(though that is not perfect either) mainly because of Vincent Price. On its own terms though, this is pretty good. It is flawed though, the characters are never really developed, and while I admired that there was an attempt to expand the story while some of it was effective there were other parts where it felt padded and didn't really go anywhere. Taylor Diggs and Peter Gallagher's performances read too much of both actors playing themselves. But the biggest let down is the ending, which felt fake and so abrupt that you are left with a that's it? sense. On the plus side, it is stylishly filmed, has a good atmosphere and some creepy and fun moments. Geoffrey Rush seems to be having the time of his life and it really shows. Famke Janssen puts her beauty and steel to good use without feeling bland, and while he has next to nothing to say Jeffrey Combs' physical acting really speaks volumes. Overall, not a bad remake but has its flaws. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (William Malone, 1999) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Halloween, I've made it a point to catch up with recent horror stuff I've missed out on: this is another one of them and, like most, it's not really been worth the effort. Mind you, it's harmless enough and not so terrible as to be unwatchable - but, for being based on the gimmicky William Castle film and the fact that Geoffrey Rush is the proprietor of amusement parks, there's little sense here of going through a fun ride! It's nasty and grim - and, apart from Rush and Famke Janssen (who play well enough off each other), none of the characters are interesting (being teenage/racial/media stereotypes, one red herring and the requisite insufferable, geeky know-it-all). Besides, nothing much seems to be happening - and, despite the fact that the house is established early on to be 'alive', the special effects (which only really come into play during the climax) seem like an afterthought!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The house is alive. We're all gonna die.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only have one complaint about this movie - it took over 45 minutes before anything interesting happened! Why in the world did they take so long to set this up? I mean they really didn't give any clue as to what was happening in that 45 minutes. It wasn't until Taye Diggs found the picture that you could guess the house was going to trump Mrs. Price (Famke Janssen) and Dr. Blackburn (Peter Gallagher).When things did get rolling, the special effects were marvelous and there was a little titillation, but the long setup just bored me to death.Diggs was good and so was Geoffrey Rush, but it was the special effects that made this all worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary Not fun Very cheesy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amusement park owner has refurbished a former asylum where a doctor had murdered many patients. He (Geoffrey Rush) and his wife (Famke Janssen) has invited guests (Taye Diggs, Peter Gallagher, Ali Larter, Bridgette Wilson, Chris Kattan) for her unique birthday party. He offers them $1M each to spend the night in the haunted house.Like the amusement park rides in the beginning, it's all flash and amusing. You know everything is fake, and it's nothing to be taken seriously. It's very cheesy. Whether it's Rush's mustache or Kattan's silliness, you just have to shake your head at it all. The set is completely fake and the people too. Sadly they didn't embrace the cheese fully to draw out a couple of chuckles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it a movie or a shock-rock video?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mind-numbing remake of an old Vincent Price scare flick from 1958 has wealthy weirdo Geoffrey Rush (pulling a James Woods) offering five nervous types a cool one million dollars each if they can spend an entire night in a doom-laden asylum. Despite one or two funny throwaway jokes, this is a really ugly movie full of carnage and disturbing imagery (it looks an awful lot like a video from Marilyn Manson). Any viewer hoping for good, cheesy scares should continue looking. Rush is actually well cast playing "Mr. Price", but the other performers are pallid, the characters and dialogue well below average. Co-produced by...Robert Zemeckis?? NO STARS from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hate myself!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid movie fan i will watch just about anything. I will give every film a blank canvas to impress me, to surprise me, to entertain me. So i recorded House on Haunted Hill on my sky plus and sat down to watch it later that night.The only scary thing about this film was that there are actually people out there in the world that enjoy this film....it really scares me.From the first scene i was beginning to regret pressing that big R on my remote, beginning to doubt my eagerness to watch all films available and by the time i (somehow) made it to end of the film i began to hate myself.The acting is atrocious, the dialogue is drenched with verbal diarrhoea, the plot is nauseatingly tedious. It is a train wreck of a film. I truly cannot understand how anyone could possibly enjoy this movie, it is a complete waste of existence. I can honestly say i would rather watch a clock tick and tock for 90 minutes than watch this bile again.If you are in a shop and you look on the shelves at the vast array of movies, if you spot this film i recommend you storm out in defiance at the mere fact this movie is being sold.Goodbye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Poor Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to my memory the original HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is a scary camp classic B movie which is relatively good fun so the idea of a FX ridden remake seems silly even more so when the horror genre has been in decline for many years with only the humour laden post modernist SCREAM series and the extremely overrated gimmicky BLAIR WITCH PROJECT making an impact at the box office . This remake has the main protagonist named Price after the star of the original film but that`s the only wit and sophistication this very poor script can come up with . The characters are unlikeable and just like the script are totally dumb . Why do people in mortal peril in haunted houses decide to split up and walk up and down pitch black catacombs ? The plot tries to twist and turn but the plot twists are so predictable and old hat you can see them coming a mile off . The only amazing thing about this film is it stars Geoffry Rush . Why do actors who come from nowhere to win the oscar for best actor decide to go on to appear in crap like this ? It was the same with F Murray Abraham . Who ? Exactly</fullReview>
