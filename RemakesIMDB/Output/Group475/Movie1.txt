		<fullReview>This movie was both critically and financially panned. Why?Two words. The Matrix.The Thirteenth Floor is a good movie. No, it's not "The Matrix" all over again, but it wasn't trying to be. Comparing these two movies is like comparing Star Trek with Star Wars. Similar in aspects, but very different in others.This is what happens when two movies of similar type are released in close proximity. The first one always has a jump-start on the second by means of box office success and pleasant reviews. That's why I think "The Thirteenth Floor" was branded as a bad movie. People had already seen "The Matrix" with it's knock-out special effects, cast and weren't open-minded for a movie on the same genre branch. So The 13th Floor was said to be 'a bland, pale imitation of the Matrix'.Maybe "The Thirteenth Floor" doesn't have a star-studded cast - yes, it's cast is mostly regular supporting players, but they work well with the material. So there's no kung-fu ass kicking scenes, so what!There's great atmosphere, a intriguing story and a real nice plot twist. To me that makes up a very fine movie. So I ask what was so very wrong with "The Thirteenth Floor" that made critics turn away and made it tank at the box office? Really it's people's unwillingness to give a similar movie a chance and instead opting to take the easy route and branding it as a "rip-off". Which is their loss unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Sc Fi Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thirteenth Floor,in my opinion,is an underrated SCI FI classic. It ranks with Blade Runner, The Matrix &amp; Dark City as Science Fiction with a brain. Not only does it raise philosophical questions around technology , reality and existence it is also an entertaining noir-thriller with a few twists. Visually it is similar to the films mentioned above (dark neon-soaked landscapes) however the contrast between the modern and the 1930's adds another level to the films beauty. The film is well cast (Gretchen Mol looks stunning)and Craig Bierko carries the film well. It's one of those rare films that crosses quite a few genres - intelligent sci fi - murder mystery - film noir - thriller - love story.If you enjoyed Blade Runner and The Matrix you will certainly like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Calm, honest, thought provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some time I have been hearing people refer to to The 13th Floor, mostly when comparing to other movies of the genre like The Matrix. I finally got around to view it myself, and I was positively surprised. After seeing Matrix I and II, its hard to imagine a film that can be on par. The 13th Floor is it. Not in action, stunts or CG, but by presenting an old, yet interesting idea in wonderful pictures and a genre between sci-fi and mystery. The main protagonists "calmness and integrity" contrasts with the absurd situation the characters are in. Camera, lighting and the "textures" are excellent and the sound track perfectly completes the unique atmosphere.Very recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>intriguing, thoughtful sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the last millennium comes to a close and a new one opens, the science fiction genre seems to have latched onto a brand new narrative format - the cyber/techno thriller, wherein characters are free to wander in and out of virtual reality worlds and are even forced to call into question the validity of the world we have hitherto smugly referred to as "reality."In 1999 alone, this theme has been explored in "The Matrix", "eXistenZ" and "The Thirteenth Floor." Actually, of the three, this is probably the most intriguing, intelligent and involving, successfully combining the elements of a whodunit with a clever sci-fi tale of a group of characters who drift in and out of a simulated version of Los Angeles in 1937. The plot, though complex, is spun out with coherence and ever-increasing clarity as the layers of information are slowly peeled back to reveal the larger picture. The filmmakers manage to create a sense of unbalance in the audience as we and the characters become more and more unclear as to what is reality and what is a simulation. Because the writers never lose their way, the result is a work of considerable mystery and intrigue.In terms of art direction and cinematography, the film is a total triumph. The Los Angeles of 1937 the moviemakers have visualized on screen actually has a slight studio backlot, artificial feel to it - perfectly befitting just the kind of world a simulator would create. The photography in these sections also utilizes a slightly off color cast, nicely reflecting the tone found in color pictures of that era."The Thirteenth Floor" may not be a very "deep" movie, but it is an honorable addition to a newly formed genre that has not yet had time to ossify in its own conventions. Time alone will tell if filmmakers will be able to expand on this theme or whether, as with most genres, it will fall victim to its own inevitable cliches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film, without an A-list cast, pulls off the plot well. The characters, although not really deep, are well structured, and the plot constructed with subtle complexity. The 1930s scenes are dramatically created. I found myself trying to guess the plot twists, but with little success as they unfolded. It was a good film, and richer in substance than the Matrix, and left you with a thought provoking afterthought about our own existence. Going into a movie, I hope to have avoided any prior information about the plot, and this one was well worth the purchase of the video. This could have made a great 3 hour movie to really develop the characters and the philosophical issues, however, it was reduced down to the 100 minutes time-span. I'd give it 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small simulation set in 1937 has been created. Our main character discovers that his recently murdered partner (the simulators creator) has been using the simulation before its release for human trial. He also discovers that a message has been left in the system for him to find. A message that promises to ultimately change everything.I recommend this film to all those who enjoyed eXistenZ etc. Fans of David Lynch will not be disappointed either. If you are a great fan of Lynch, then you will see this as an easy to follow film that has some nice turns and twists without forcing you to pause and rewind or watch again.The film manages to persuade you of the complex simulated world without spending too much of its budget on special effects, unlike the matrix, which ultimately destroyed itself by its overdone sequels. Great set of actors here too. Ones that deserve the job title "actor" and have many creditations to their name.I am surprised that this little effort hasn't been more popular since it manages to get a complex story line and make it very easy to follow without becoming bogged down with the characters explaining each scene (ergo the matrix).Overall, definitely one to watch and one to own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thirteenth Floor is a thoughtful and engaging film that asks its audience to think about the difference between reality and virtual reality. The Matrix asks similar questions in an action format appealing to a wider audience, but the Thirteenth Floor exceeds the Matrix in two respects. First, it uses a thoughtful approach that establishes its characters as more than 2-D, comic-book type heroes and villains. Second, it builds longer and with more subtlety, so that the payoff comes much later.And a delightful payoff it is. Imagine the Matrix with less action fluff, real human relationships, and a plot twist reminiscent of the Sixth Sense. Fans of thought-provoking science fiction in the vain of Gattaca will enjoy the Thirteenth Floor just as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the first half does not account for much, THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR is a surprisingly half-decent movie. The story is well put, the acting seems to fit. What seems to be another TWILIGHT ZONE knock-off is saved by an endless supply (maybe too many) of twists and turns. THIRTEENTH FLOOR is watchable!A famous computer scientist is murdered in his own virtual simulation and his friends investigate. Particularly Douglas Hall, who is suspect #1 of the murder.What starts out as questioning the use of virtual reality (Do virtual people have a soul?) becomes much more than that. Science never ends. The 'poor man's MATRIX' as it was called in 1999 is a good, involving story that may be confronted in the future. Some boring moments aside, THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR is a welcome addition for science fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a child of the 50's, and spent my preteen years feasting on all the classic sifi gems, such as " The day the earth stood still", "Forbidden Planet' etc. The 13th floor reminds me of those movies. This movie has been compared to the matrix, and that is unfair, Special effects are fine, but when they become the focal point of the movie, I think film suffers because of it. I liked the 13th floor because it didn't get caught up in all that technology and reallied on a great script, and a wonderful ensemble cast. I would highly recommend this movie to all, especially if you prefer the old "War of the Worlds" over the new one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1937 Los Angeles looks really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thirteenth Floor boasts an outstanding production design. Not the futuristic computer lab but the Los Angeles of the thirties. The art direction is remarkable. The Wilshire Grand Hotel is amazing to look at, both inside and out. The first time we see Los Angeles, we are amazed to see cable cars! Pretty much a rarity these days. The surrounding desert shows what LA used to look like, and it makes you wonder what life was like back in that era. As for the movie itself, it's not that bad. The film really moves when it centers in on the mystery of who killed who. Craig Bierko, sounding like Jeff Goldblum, delves into the LA of the past to find out what is going on. Of course, LA of the past only exists in a computer. The film zips along and carries us for the ride, only toward the end does it seem to drag down a little.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie touches idea about creation and living in the virtual world and how it could impact you, how power makes you ill and crazy and you start to destroy your creation. Yes, someone maybe can claim a movie dull sometimes, but it's really different mood, it's not action-based, but thought and dialog based. And end, altought I guessed it could be like that way, surprised me anyway.In overall, good, very interesting point of view to virtual worlds and playing god theme. Hollywood ending is somehow very oversweet (for me doesn't matter, I like happy endings sometimes, when it involves romance :)), it raises many points to think about.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful.I haven't read any Rotten Tomatoes reviews on this movie, I only saw it recently broadcast on TV. This movie is not the Matrix! Interestingly the old movie "Tron" was shown on TV just a few days before, and this is perhaps appropriate.If you've played "The Sims" then this movie might make you think again. What if the game you were playing was with real people? Who are the real people? This is a layer cake of a movie. The imagery in this movie is stunning, with the 1930s LA a visual feast. Loved the sepia tinting of these sequences, passed off in the movie as a software fault that needed work.The plot is straightforward for the first 2/3rds of the movie, but then it accelerates and goes into left-field. I thought the ending was acceptable: indeed I thought the colours in the ending suggested that that this was another level to the virtual reality, which left a pleasant taste as it were in my intellectual mouth.Best visual effect? The Edge of The World.Quantum Leap!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is clever and fun, and relies on less action and more thought to drive it along than, say, The Matrix.I am not a fan of martial arts films, and while I don't mind action films, I tend to find them to be a bit boring.This is a real thinker, a sci-fi film quite unlike any other I have seen. I've always been fond of this movie, with actors who are not well-known but still manage to shine on their own. With relatively unknown actors in the film, it made it much easier to accept the reality of the story than if there were stars all over this film.Also, there are actions scenes but they do not require unrealistic kung fu moves that go on and on for twenty minutes. Instead, there is a nod to the film noir genre, with its tough-guy characters, shady dames, and guns and fists.If you enjoy detective films, sci fi, or just like to be entertained, this will definitely serve well.If you are looking for some run of the mill sci-fi goof-off, go check out something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and thought-provoking....very underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thirteenth Floor is one of those films that has gotten lost under all the more well-known films of the late nineties; and this is a shame, because it's a damn sight better than a lot of the films that always receive praise from the critics. Not everything in this film works, and for that reason and others; it's no masterpiece, but you've got to admire The Thirteenth Floor for it's originality, and it's ability to pull a coherent plot out of a scenario that has 'disaster' written all over it. The film is based on the book "Simulacron-3" by Daniel F. Galouye, which is the same book that inspired Rainer Werner Fassbinder's "World on a Wire". Whether or not this version is better, I can't tell you having not seen Fassbinder's version; but I can tell you that this version is worth seeing. The film follows the death of a computer programmer. He was working on a computer simulated world before his death, and his colleague; Douglas Hall, believes that the programmer left the key to discovering his murderer inside the virtual world...prompting him to go in search of it.The film works both as an entertaining science fiction flick, and a thought provoking drama. The film asks questions about the value of life and the ills of playing God; and although these questions have been asked by many films many times before; here, it's done so well that you forget that and ask yourself these questions all over again. The twist at the centre of the movie extremely well worked, and after it hits you'll ask yourself how you didn't guess it sooner - and that is testament to the excellent plotting preceding it. Despite being a science fiction film, there is very little in the way of special effects in this film. However, the movie makes up for this with the excellent way that 1937 Los Angeles is created - it's easy to buy into the film's multi-world plot, and for that reason; it doesn't need special effects to work. The acting is largely good, with Craig Bierko impressing in the lead role. Vincent D'Onofrio, Gretchen Mol and 24's Dennis Haysbert, who is excellent in his small role, support him. On the whole, this isn't brilliant or a masterpiece; but as far as modern Sci-Fi goes; this is one of the best I've seen.</fullReview>

Just enough good special effects to generate some "wow!"'s. At heart, this is a film noir murder mystery that Rod Serling would have loved; shows what a good script with a hard-working cast can do (if kept far enough away from George Lucas).Twenty years from now, when the Matrix trilogy is finally relegated to the dustbin, if only because it took itself too seriously, The Thirteenth Floor will be remembered with the respect it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with a plot instead of special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having avoided seeing "The Matrix" and pre/sequels I didn't have that to compare "The 13th Floor" against. Actually, I wandered into the movie during a very late TV broadcast, and was seriously confused for a lot of it. when I got a chance to see the entire movie I enjoyed it greatly.The idea of virtual reality is very old hat to science fiction readers, but the idea of dropping into an existing character is thought-provoking. (I started to give examples, but this movie doesn't deserve spoilers--you need to see it cold.) Suffice it to say, the characters in the simulated 1937 were real to themselves. They didn't need someone playing God with their lives--as the present-day people find out.If you like flashy special-effects and kick-ass action, this isn't much of a movie (though both 1937 and present-day LA were beautifully done--I would have loved to have seen more of both). But if you prefer a story, "The 13th Floor" is a good movie. Don't go looking to compare it to another--watch it on it's own merits. Even the syrupy end isn't too bad--and I'd like to have seen more of that world also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Matrix" has this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was overshadowed by, and ultimately lost in The Matrix, just like Dark City. Each of these films dealt with our perception of reality, but this one here, at least in Book form, was the absolute first, decades prior to the Wachowski brothers.Released in a flurry of invisibility in May 1999, exactly two months after The Matrix came out, this film was quietly swallowed up in The Matrix, although it was almost the exact same premise as The Matrix.Produced by world-destruction expert Roland Emmerich, directed by Josef Rusnak (who is directing this year's "Beyond") - For a film made by Emmerich, this film does not have 15-mile wide spaceships, or a huge Pyramid ship and a Ring that flushes sideways, or environmental disasters, or Mel Gibson waving Flags that had not been conceived yet... This film is a very quiet, Noir film, completely different than the normal Faire that Emmerich's company Centropolis produces.With a cast headed by Craig Bierko, a very pretty Gretchen Mol, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Dennis Haysbert, not to mention a hippy version of Vincent D'Onofrio along with a Bartender version of same, this film was the first to ask the question: "What if... what we perceive as reality is not reality at all, but some constructed thing?" - But whereas The Matrix has only The Matrix, this film deals with Worlds within Worlds, a concept and direction that I thought The Matrix was taking in the final scene of "Matrix Reloaded" but was disappointed to be proved wrong with "Matrix Revolutions".That is where story-wise, this film supersedes The Matrix, it has a much superior concept driving the storyline. Where the Matrix was globbed together by the Wachowski brothers, this film was actually based on a world-class science fiction novel "Simulacron-3" written by Daniel F. Galouye. An Earlier version of this story was made for TV in West Germany in 1973 as "World on a Wire".In 1937 Los Angeles, Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl), leaves a Hotel, visits a bar and gives bartender Jerry Ashton (Vincent D'Onofrio) a note to be given to a man named "Douglas Hall". Needless to say, Ashton immediately opens the note. Fuller goes home and goes to bed, and wakes up in 1999 Los Angeles... He was in a Virtual Construct of 1937 Los Angeles.This is the beginning of the film - in 1999 LA, some bad things happen and Douglas Hall is to be blamed for them... Until he meets Fuller's Daughter Jane (Grethen Mol) who can give him an alibi - Except for the fact that she does not exist and Fuller "Never Had a Daughter" according to cop Dennis Haysbert. From there, this film wades between 1937 Los Angeles and 1999 Los Angeles... And we have to guess how deep the construct goes. In a way, this is similar to the film "Inception" and the "Dream within a Dream within a Dream within a Dream" concept... Except that this is no dream, as Ashton tells Hall: "We are real people and you are screwing with us".If The Matrix had not bombarded the market with it's weaker concept of this plot, this film might have been the sleeper of 1999. As it is, I think this film is the better of the two, although I liked both of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts as a typical VR story: Oh dear, if we can create worlds that are exactly like ours, is our world real or is it just another video game? What's reality? What's reality?! Okay, so we've been here before. Many many times before. What is different about this movie is that it actually simplifies the situation by giving a solution to it. In order to provide a sort of reasonable climax that isn't just throwing everything into the wind and saying, "Haha, now you aren't certain, are you?" this movie does what seems to be the blatantly obvious and gives the simulacrum a soul.THAT'S awesome because honestly it's nice to have a sort of direction for this philosophical discussion, and instead of making it, "If they have a soul, what does that mean to us?" it just ends with the, "But they have a soul... leave them alone." This is a refreshing break from everything else along this topic we've been subject to.Unfortunately, that's about all that's good about this movie. Flat acting holding up a slightly misappropriated pace centers around a story that seemed to struggle, really struggle to find a way to fit in at least a little violence and a love story. A few blatant plot-holes coincide with a hidden enemy whose motivations are incredibly contrived and forced. This film doesn't feel or work as well as it should, and it seems utterly removed from the spectators, almost as if it's so caught in its own world that it doesn't really care about being a story, it just cares about getting the job done.Yet as a practice in mise-en-scene and as one of the few movies of its subject matter that decides to actually conclude its message, it's still something to be appreciated in its own way.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

A superbly written script sucks us into the ideas the story is exploring before shaking loose another layer of stuff to think about. As Dark City moved the buildings and furniture around, The Thirteenth Floor moves the characters around different times - is anyone real or are we being treated to someone's imagination? The acting is top class throughout, the screenplay deftly executed, and the cinematography brilliantly evocative of what we are supposed to feel. There is very little to find fault with. What does surprise me is that this film has not received a greater following.Well worthy of 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty interesting movie in general, but with some flaws. While watching, I was continuously being reminded of other movies (which is a bad thing). I know that The Thirteenth Floor didn't rip off these other movies, but it did stumble into its share of cliches. When Armin Mueler-Stahl is walking in and everyone greets him even though he doesn't know them; reminded me of The Graduate with Benjamin at the hotel. The scene when the cop pulls over Ashton and finds the body in the trunk reminded me of just about every movie. And the idea that their world was artificially created and their is an end point signifying a fake world, definitely reminded me of Dark City. Finally, the dumb chase scene near the end where the elevator door is closing and Bierko just barely gets his hand in to prevent it. Bullets fly and it's a shame. There was one really cool thing that I noticed. The same song that the band is playing in a '30s scene is again played by a live band in a '90s scene when Bierko and Mol are dancing. Very nice special effects too. The acting was good, with the main characters sometimes acting in three different roles. For a great movie with Bierko in it, see Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas; Bierko is simply hilarious in the scenes that he appears.The ideas that the movie presented were very interesting. I wish the writer and director would have followed the philosophical implications instead of what they did. It should have showed the hopelessness and despair that the characters of the artificial world would now be going through, for example; the cop (who throws in his share of dumb lines), instead of the lovely and uplifting final scene. It would have made for a much more powerful ending. So, good; but could have been better. Worth your time though.</fullReview>

However these two films are not the same. Whereas the twist is saved for the ending in eXistenZ in The Thirteenth Floor you are told in the film a long time before the film ends, plus you can figure it out before if you really search for something and if you keep your attention, which I didn't (END OF SPOILER&lt;&gt;START READING AGAIN). Furthermore there really isn't that much to say, the effects were good as was the acting and the plot. The only thing that I really didn't like that much in this film was, that it sometimes was too predictable and I think it's a pity, because it kind of made the film a bit worse than it actually was, because it was an entertaining and exciting movie.

		<fullReview>Don't be misguided by the reviews saying this movie sides with ones like Blade Runner or Matrix. While I must admit it clearly had the potential to do so, in the end, well, it just isn't so.The plot of this film is very interesting. I wonder the book in which it's inspired must be very good. The characterization of the Los Angeles of 1930 is great. But the movie itself is very badly directed and most of the actors are just equally bad. Thi first half of the movie is very rushed what makes the characters seem pretty unreasonable and superficial.So the in the end the result is just an ordinary movie. It's a little enjoyable, but far from memorable. I give it 5/10 for the studio having wasted such a good history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost every review compares this movie to either "The Matrix" or "The Dark City" -- mostly unfavorably.I don't know about anyone, but I thought this was better than "The Matrix", which was too polished and ritzy for my liking.I've always had trouble understanding the hype surrounding "The Matrix". It's a fine movie, but it's also extremely overrated. And all the movies, with a similar premise, that were produced after it, are now destined to live in its shadow. Not fair.I won't even mention "The Dark City", because, to me, it was *utter* crap. I hated it."The Thirteenth Floor" is a griping, atmospheric, well-acted movie with a decent plot. It doesn't have the "hi-tech" feel of "The Matrix", but that is what I like about it.I'd gladly watch it again, and recommend it to anyone, who likes a decent sci-fi story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Most movies are at least superficially about real people. `Matrix' (`Truman' and many others) put real people in artificial worlds. `Bladerunner' (and lessor films like `AI') put artificial people in the real world. Now finally we have artificial people in artificial worlds, unknowingly as in `Bladerunner.' A clever beginning, but not enough.The production values are not the problem, nor is the level of acting -- so many successful scifi picts have uninspired acting that it is nearly a prerequisite. The problem is that the film is too safe. It decides to impress on an intellectual level, which is noble but dangerous.Safety: everything is understandable, even predictable. The ending is safe: there IS a reality and creators after all folks. The mechanics are safe: controllable (at least in this story) computers.The notion could have really done a fine number by using a more sophisticated notion of computers (the story seems set in the 60s so far as technology) and by tying the notion of virtual reality for entertainment to film and then the very film WE are watching. Like `My Dinner With Andre.' Like `Draughtsman's Contract.' Even `Sweet and Lowdown' which also had Gretchen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other reviewers will explain this movie, but i just wanted to say that it was a pleasant surprise to watch, it was a book that referenced this film that brought me here, otherwise i perhaps would of passed it by because i never heard of it, its a shame that it is so Underrated but it really is a great film. The acting was quite good as well and it was interesting to note Vincent D'Onofrios performance as another pleasant surprise, this is the actor that played private pile in Full Metal Jacket, i had never seen him in another role after that movie and so it was good to see him and his fine acting again. Not forgetting Craig Bierko the lead actor was also very good.Do watch this, you will be happy with the result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I vaguely remember watching this movie when it first came out. I thought it was lame, and it seemed a bit phony. Now here I am 12 years later, and I just watched it again. I really liked it a lot. Who could truly understand this movie in 1999? These days I spend my time playing GTA4 and JustCause2 for many more hours than I like to admit. I wonder what games will be like 12 years from now? When my real life gets boring, it's easy to relate it too a big video game, that has grown tiring. It all just feels a bit fake or surreal. This movie does a great job of making a person question their own reality. Maybe we are all just pre programmed. Could we all just be some experiment, monitored by those of higher enlightenment outside our understanding? Maybe when you die, you just wake up to into a much grander design!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good noir virtual reality thriller film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film wasn't a big hit, nor did it have any top actors or actresses. It still was interesting and entertaining from beginning to end with it's well developed plot. There is some philosophical aspects to the film as well if you pay attention, which I thought went well with the whole scenario. The film isn't very complex nor does it try to be, but it still gets the job done and although the twist and turns are simple, it's still not that predictable. It's thought provoking and works sort of like a detective movie, where the protagonist and even the audience is trying to find out what it going on and has enough substance to go with it. The protagonist is basically trying to solve a murder while he is the number one suspect. There was also plenty of ways to lengthen this movie while being fast paced with more character development and more philosophical with some detail of some of the aspects of the stuff that goes on, which I wouldn't have mind, cause I wanted to see more after the credit started rolling. A lot of films in the future is going to be influenced by this film like "The Matrix" has. Good movie about virtual reality and it's layers.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie...In Some Respects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, The 13th Floor really isn't an 8, it is more like a 6.5. The 13th Floor does deal with some concepts that were pretty far ahead thinking for when the movie was made, so I will give The 13th Floor an 8. The 13th Floor is a movie about virtual reality and like the movie the Matrix The 13th Floor has an interesting spin on "what is real." I also liked the way the movie depicted how users who enter realistic virtual 3D worlds where they can do anything they want often become warped by those worlds. I think with emergent 3D worlds like Second Life the affects of what people do in the virtual and how that both reflects and affects the actual will become big issues in our near future. The 13th Floor was ahead of its time by dealing with that issue, which impressed me.You see a few big name actors in this film before they were famous and a few actors that you wonder why didn't their careers didn't go further.The ending for me was a little disappointing and I thought a weak spot in the script writing. If the ending would have been different and maybe if The 13th Floor has slightly better visual effects the movie could have been a solid 9. The visual effects guys did do a great job by 1999 standards of creating what Los Angeles probably looked like in the 30ies. Also the custom and set designers did a fantastic job for the 30ies sets as well.So, I would recommend it because it gets you thinking a bit. Is it a keeper for the DVD collection? I would say borderline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider this film great as a concept film because its metaphor of humans living in a provisional reality--one that has only relative substance which can be awakened from or "died to" at any point. And then the new reality is only provisional too!What is the "real" world we live in? We live on a plane of relative existence but meditate or eventually die to wake into another dimension of existence. Most people doubt this to be true, and imagine this material world is all there is. But films like eXistenZ, The Thirteenth Floor, The Truman Show, Matrix, and several others are trying to wake humanity up to the illusory state of things.And incidentally The Thirteenth Floor did this job extremely well by using the metaphor of the dialed in computer model of the virtual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as the critic thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: Special effects, script.Cons: Gets a bit too unbelievable, last 20 minutes ruins it.The Thirteenth Floor was critically panned but it really isn't that bad. Craig Bierko is an inventor of a virtual reality game in which all the characters are real enough to, as Dennis Haysberth puts it, "f**k". His mentor, played by Armin Mueller Stahl frequents this land and comes upon a secret. He gives a note to a bartender (played by Vincent D'nofrio) to give to Bierko. The bartender instead reads it and discovers the secret. Armin Mueller dies and Bierko must go into this land to find out who killed him. The plot twists are many and startling as you begin to watch the movie. Similar to the matrix and Dark City because the charactes are in a prison and they are unaware to it. I call the Matrix, Dark city, and the Thirteenth floor the Perception Vs Reality series. The Matrix takes the philosophical side, Dark city the humanistic side, but Thirteenth Floor explores the technological side of the argument of what makes us human. Ultimately inferior to the prior films, it is still one of the best sci-fi films of the 90's.Premise: Bierko must find out who killed Stahl.The thirteenth floor was nominated for best science fiction film at the Saturn Award.Grade: 8.2/10 (Good Film)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Matrix might be a copy of this movie. However, to my surprise, both movies were made in 1999. Those two movies have similar concepts.An audience has to be actively thinking in order to understand the logic and intelligence of this movie. The writer and screenwriter must have spent some time to make up a story that flows so smoothly. Of course, there is one obvious mistake. In order to make computers that are so sophisticated, I do not think that there could be only two workers working in the lab.It does not have all those high tech movement as in the Matrix, however, it is absolutely a smart movie. The common audience might not even understand.I am glad that I have seen this movie. I have never heard about this movie until I accidently found it at a local library. Too bad, it did not make a big hit in the main stream. Otherwise, we can expect a sequel II.It is definitely a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing you're stuck by while watching this movie is how stylish is it, both in terms of look and movement. A very odd concept: a murder mystery set in 1930s Los Angeles by way of virtual reality. Indeed, it's like the technology (very '90s) hopped in the sack with the design elements of "Gattaca" and nine months later, "The Thirteenth Floor" was born.Solid performances from the cast, notably Craig Bierko's accused man, straining to get his questions answered before the cops get him (which includes the likable-but-still menacing Dennis Haysbert). And before I forget, the quite fetching Gretchen Mol. Not really much in the way of character development, but it helps that the focus here is on the central mystery plot. But it's a story that keeps the viewer thinking from the very beginning, and one that leads to a nice surprise of an ending (not a shocker). And overall terrific production design that plunges you right into Los Angeles, 1937. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The peculiar year of 1999 brought about three sci-fi based flicks circling around the theme of virtual reality. The bombastic "Matrix" attacked sensorically, whilst inspiring some covert philosophical questions. Meanwhile David Cronenberg retreading paths already ventured eking out a somewhat redundant, albeit intriguing take on the new technoorganic future of mankind with "eXistenZ". With these two powerful pieces "The Thirteenth Floor", much more coy in ambition and restrained in goals, got somewhat overlooked, taking a historical back-burner, nonetheless garnering some fan-base, which allowed the picture to linger.Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl), the creator of a virtual realm filled with conscious beings re-imagined in our likeness, ventures one last time into his 1930s inspired world to leave a message of warning to his associate Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko). Some grim mystery unravelled leads Fuller to desperation, but soon meets his end when murdered by an unnamed assailant. In order to uncover the cause of his mentor's death Douglas decides to enter the VR with the help of his coworker Jason Whitney (Vincent D'Onofrio). Meanwhile the heir to Fuller's company - a previously unknown daughter - Jane Fuller (Gretchen Mol) appears with claim to the fortune and to her father's discoveries...Unmistakenly neo-noir, especially and unsurprisingly when thrown back to the razzmatazz of 1930s Los Angeles, "The Thirteenth Floor" creates a world, which feels instantaneously attractive. The concept itself of living in a programmed world may seem somewhat trivial, but the delivery is anything but. Hannon Fuller turns out to be less than perfect, as he used his newly created world to venture into sexual escapades with hotel dancers, living excessively and without remorse (unfortunately not an issue fervently explored). Similarly other people using VR tend to usurp the power given to do things they would never think of in real life, as if using the VR as a valve for releasing hidden anxieties and wants.The problem however with "The Thirteenth Floor" comes with the final act. When the pieces start falling into place there remains no mystery and the solution becomes evident long before the puzzle has been solved. After a captivating setup the direction soon becomes all too obvious, thus the atmosphere of intrigue dissipates, leaving a rather hollow shell on which the director places a somewhat sappy love story with a twist. This part of the movie sticks out sorely and the director seems to put in all his best effort to close out and finish before everything spirals out of control. Once offering the solution to the mystery Josef Rusnak has nothing left to offer, albeit the issue of realising inner dreams in an alternative reality seems ripe for the taking (as well as the ills of playing God). Despite some overall allure a lot of the movie doesn't really work, which makes it a different take on the matter. Enjoyable but ultimately not one offering much deeper insight and with a faltering delivery (despite an astute and well bent script).</fullReview>

Craig Bierko and Grethen Mol had the justifiable chemistry needed to move the story. It gets tiring to see the same actors in romantic parts. I didn't feel the story pushing me to believe anything in this film because the plot itself worked.All the actors in this film were first-rate.

		<fullReview>Life is demanding, unless you're independently wealthy, or retired, or living on a deserted island somewhere in the South Pacific. Most of us gotta make a buck. So, if you're a movie critic with deadlines to meet, time is a precious commodity. Therefore, it seems to me that professional movie critics probably don't spend as much time reviewing some movies as they should. Most movies are easily understood &amp; enjoyed during one sitting. I'm thinking here of comedies, romance movies, action movies, etc. However, certain movies--mostly of the science-fiction genre--require slow digestion. Mental incubation is necessary to appreciate these movies. "The Thirteenth Floor" is one such movie. As I scroll down the rottentomatoes reviews, it is evident to me that most critics probably didn't spend enough time watching it. One critic crows: "This is a film about deeply confused people that seems likely to put viewers in a state of deep confusion for most of its running time." Another opins: "As compelling as a knock-knock joke." Yeesh. It makes me wonder if these pundits actually watched the bloody thing. One gets the impression that while watching it, they had their thumbs poised over the fast-forward button. (Those damned deadlines, you know.) In any event, keep in mind the Irish playwright Brendan Behan's wry observation: "Critics are like eunuchs in a harem; they know how it's done, they've seen it done every day, but they're unable to do it themselves."Now, I'm not a simple-minded guy, I hope. But I found that I appreciated this movie more after having watched it a second, and then a third time. I agree that at first blush, it is superficially confusing. (Geez, if you want a no-brainer, watch an Abbott &amp; Costello movie.) This movie is for a thinking man... WHOOPS!! Er, make that a "thinking person". In fact, I consider it one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen. It is very stylish, well-acted &amp; well-written. Much time &amp; effort obviously went into recreating certain parts of 1937 California. The only serious problem I had with it was the loud, mechanical-sounding whirring noises &amp; excessive laser lighting generated by the computer equipment. This was very implausible, 'though it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie.Before watching this movie, I'd never heard of Craig Bierko. But I thought that as the protagonist, he was excellent. He seemed aloof at times, but I didn't think that this was a problem. And maybe this is what his role required of him. Armin Mueller-Stahl's acting career spans almost half a century, with over one hundred movies to his credit, according to IMDb. He is the consummate actor. Very dependable &amp; a fine choice for the role of computer genius &amp; mentor to Bierko's character. His heavy German accent seemed all the more appropriate. Gretchen Mol was also very credible, and she wasn't hard to look at, either. I thought the ever mercurial Vincent D'Onofrio was convincing (no pun intended) as a computer geek-cum-antagonist. It's hard to believe that he was the guy who played the psycho in "The Cell"! I mean, the guy is so adaptable.I shall resist the temptation to describe the movie's structure, because I think it is often better to watch a movie with little or no foreknowledge of the plot details. For instance, I bought "The Thirteenth Floor" on a whim because I liked the DVD box cover &amp; because the price was right. I suggest that if you are an aficionado of the sci-fi genre, just buy it, then watch it, and THEN check it out on the net. I will say that, to the unwashed, the plot of this movie is far-fetched in the extreme. However, some computer science theorists suggest that in the future, what is depicted in this movie would be possible. We are already developing quantum, quasi-biological computers, so who knows? Thank God I'll be dead before they arrive.So, there you have this critic's opinions. If you like a good, stylish sci-fi movie, rent it. Or buy it. (I found it in a used CD/DVD store.) But WATCH it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that after seeing the trailer for this film months ago, failing to notice any impact it might have had on the US box office then watching it stagger hopelessly straight onto the video shelves here in the UK, I ended up renting it in the hope that it might at least be bad enough to raise a laugh. But - shock horror - it's not. In fact it's a smart little film that deserves far better treatment than it's had so far.It might not be exactly what you expect right from the word go, but that's not necessarily a bad thing: it's just that the film takes its time when it comes to introducing the sci-fi elements, so it's easy to feel cheated at first as basically the only people likely to see this film are genre fans. But things pick up quickly after the dull first half-hour of exposition and sketchy character introduction. There are enough twists and turns during the next hour to keep on redoubling your interest, and the cast holds up well: Craig Bierko (previously known to me only as Lister from the mercifully short-lived US Red Dwarf remake - poor bloke) is a surprisingly strong leading man, dealing as well as the rest of the cast (good old Vincent D'Onofrio in particular) with those multiple roles. The only real problem with the cast is that it's not even B-list. If the filmmakers had only had the budget to take on some better-known faces for the lead roles, this could have gone down a storm. Sad but true.Yes, the storyline has been done before, but so has every other sci-fi storyline these days, and this one's easily different and polished enough to warrant a look - just prepare to be kept on your toes, as it's not the mindless crash-bang action cheese laser death cyborg kickboxing spectacular you might have been expecting.</fullReview>

Think of Inception but 12 years earlier. It's also very similar to Matrix without the violence. More of an artistic-noir look at Virtual Reality. If you're a sci-fan give this title a chance, you won't be disappointed. The acting is also underrated. Most of the actors in this movie have gone onto become big time actors. I think the problem was that Matrix came out at the same time and provided the de-facto standard for new Sci-fi, and what they are supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thirteenth Floor was Columbia Pictures answer to the Matrix and is based on the award winning 1964 Sci-Fi novel, Simulacron 3 by Daniel Galouye. I have known about this movie for a long time, but was always hesitant to see it, because when something like this appears in theaters 6 months after a groundbreaking film like the Matrix, you fully expect it to be a complete rip off. I was sitting at home flipping through the channels and saw the Matrix on, but I didn't wanna see it for the millionth time and decided to see if the Thirteenth Floor was streaming and sure it enough it was, and what a terrific story it turned out to be! In the year 2000, scientists have found a way to transfer a persons consciousness into a fully interactive computer program which has the potential to replace video games. The creator however has discovered a major problem with the system and is found dead. The second in charge of the project soon learns the answer to this brutal murder appears in the simulator, which is a replica of 1937. The story is absolutely ingenious and I loved how the film jumps between present day and the 1930s, it was like watching two stories at once that you knew would eventually come together. Craig Bierko stars in what turns out to be one of his few leading roles and he's just terrific. I remember him as the bad guy in the Long Kiss Goodnight and I thought he was great then, and he's great now. To make the cast even stronger, they take the intense Bierko and pair him with Law &amp; Order's Vincent D'Onofrio, who is quite possibly the most intense actor in Hollywood. To top the whole thing off, this movie has a huge twist in the end, a twist that will make a lot of people wonder about the true nature of their own reality. The Thirteenth Floor is a fresh story with an amazing cast that will make you think, movies like this don't come along as often as they should!</fullReview>

It's filmed in L.A., and, if you know something about filming costs, you know that $16,000,000 is a ridiculous budget AND that L.A. is one of the more expensive places to film in.But this movie has something many other ones don't: a good plot!The 13th Floor changed my way to think a movie by showing me a great film that has almost no special effects. The story doesn't need them, they'd have probably degraded the movie, contaminating its plain noir atmosphere. This is even more relevant if you think that it's a Sci-Fi movie, so a genre that usually (together with action movies) exceeds in special effects and stunning scenes.I've been so lucky to watch it years before the "other so-called similar" movie (that actually isn't similar at all) which partially overshadowed this masterwork, so I appreciated The 13th Floor much more (and never really appreciated too much the other one, that would have been nothing without special effects).I suggest everyone who likes good stories (not only Sci-Fi) to watch this great movie, I ensure no one will regret.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far better than Matrix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that The thirteenth floor is far superior to Matrix. Actually, I almost walked away from the first of Wachowski's "masterpiece", so hollow and childish and CGI-ridden it seemed. The thirteenth floor has superb acting, great locations and touching music (especially in the scene when the "end of the world" is discovered by Doug). There is great chemistry between the main characters, and the dialogue is very believable and authentic all along. It is surprising that there are no plot holes in a relatively complex story. This movie is for adults, not for post-puberty greenhorns (that's Matrix' audience). No offense, it's just an opinion of a grown, experienced person.</fullReview>

Special effects are just there to strengthen the plot, and that plot is damn' interesting. Descartes's quotation (I think Therefore I am) was very well chosen.Of course this movie reminds the Matrix. But the story is better and the special FXs don't invade the screen as they do in the Matrix.It seems that some people remember that a sci-fi movie does not just need tremendous effects.

		<fullReview>I have to admit that this one got beyond me from time to time so these are just some impressionistic shards.It's about a software engineer (Craig Bierko) whose boss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is murdered, sliced to pieces in fact, one night in Los Angeles. The police come to suspect him. Bierko feels that the clues to the recent murder lie in the past, in Muehler-Stahl's youth, in the Los Angeles of 1937. Mueller-Stahl has been working on a device that sends the user back in time and it's possible that he has been leading a double life, one in modern LA and the other in 1937 LA. When the subject's consciousness is transferred, it loses awareness of itself and assumes a different, time-specific identity that does not remember the future. Bierko has his friend and co-worker (Vincent D'Onofrio) send him back for two hours. (Anything more than one hour is dangerous.) The machine has a glitch or something and before you know it, there are several people switching back and forth from past to present. One of them is Gretchen Mol, which is nice.It's all pretty jumble and confusing to me and seems mainly an excuse for magnificent displays of computer-generated images, bars of laser-light like, and all the expectable rest. Splendid production design, though, in both parallel worlds.Mueller-Stahl is always reliable and Gretchen Mol is a beautiful young woman. Craig Bierko has a talent that seems made for TV. His performance is adequate but illustrates the limits of his range. George Clooney with a voice that squeaks when it expresses excitement. Very good performance by D'Onofrio with a face and demeanor that could go either way.Have you seen the Los Angeles of 1937 in "Chinatown"? (If you haven't, then do so at once, I implore you.) It's all sunny and bright. Fewer cars, less smog. Fewer people, more orange groves and flowers. This 1937 Los Angeles is dark and wet, just like the Los Angeles of the present. Everything is dark. Even the offices of the software company are dark. I'll bet the surgical teams are performing laparotomies in total blackness. Well, maybe a candle or two. It's just a silly fad, this dark lighting.In fact, considering that another movie about time travel and solving a murder was released about the same time, "Deja Vu" with Denzel Washington, I'm beginning to wonder if time travel to solve a murder isn't liable to become a craze in and of itself. It would be nice if it were a genuine possibility. I'd like to go back to 1937 Los Angeles myself, but only with my present consciousness intact, so I could buy up all the real estate and discover Lana Turner in Schwab's Drug Store.Things being what they are, however, and being stuck in the present, I gave up on this about half-way through. It simply didn't seem interesting enough to hold my attention. They blew too many opportunities. For example, there ought to be multiple instances in which people are transported into the past and bump into different fashions of quotidian life. Isn't anyone surprised at the price of gas at the pump in 1937 Los Angeles? Where are the bottles of milk with the cream separated at the top? I'm listening to the climax now, from the other room, and it's full of the kind of gun shots that suggest the time-travel mystery has turned into a more familiar shoot 'em up, but in any case I doubt that the sun is shining, wherever and whenever the characters are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A virtually dull reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2nd 'virtual reality' thriller of the year (following The Matrix), this did not enjoy a fraction of the former's success, probably due to a lack of stars and poor marketing. The concept is great: what if we create an alternate reality through our use of computers and all the 'inhabitants' of this computer-reality, despite being just bits of data, consider themselves as real &amp; valid as us? It all goes back to that old saying: I think; therefore, I am. This idea is then refurbished halfway through with a surprise revelation (though experienced film-goers will guess this about a third of the way in). But, somehow, the exciting ideas are not translated well thru the story. There is a hum-drum monotonous tone throughout and most of the actors kind of sleepwalk through their roles (Mol, especially, is completely lacking in any screen presence). The filmmakers also fail to fully develop the repercussions of these tantalizing, even mind-blowing concepts. After all, this all seems to point to some very dangerous aspects, philosophically, of our ever-growing technology. The dangerous potential is glossed over in the end, as if prepping for a sequel, which looks doubtful now. Armin Mueller-Stahl appears as the originator of the technology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Soooo far ahead of its time, what an amazing film! Sure the Matrix had more money and better FX but I'd be willing to bet my left nut that if this were remade (for modern times with a generous budget), a smarter audience would agree that this film blows that cyber punk hacker crap called The Matrix way out of the water.From beginning to end this movie had my attention and of course I could pick a little at the dialog here or there or this or that, but it was made in the 90's, over a decade and a half ago. I mean, in 5 years, we'll be 20 years ahead of where we are now, so considering that, this has just earned a 9/10 in my book.I have absolutely no reason not to recommend this to anyone. Well, anyone with the ability to see beyond the (very slight) limitations of when this was made. Even then the 1930's was fantastic and so was the future. I'll stop there so that there aren't any spoilers, but if you have any interest in this sort of thing, I can guarantee that you'll at least be able to appreciate the movie and its ideas, if not, actually enjoy it and have a good time as I did.(In order to avoid stone throwing, I have to add this &gt;) There is quite a following for The Matrix and we can never really compare movies side by side as these stories were different and so was the 'feel' (unless its a remake of the very same movie, maybe.) and The Matrix had 4 times! the budget this movie had. So.. anyway: DO NOT SKIP OUT ON THIS MOVIE. You just might regret it.That's Allstate's stand ... are you in good hands? ;)</fullReview>

Armin Mueller-Stahl and Vincent D'Onofrio were perfect in their respective pivotal role. rest chipped in well."The Thirteenth Floor" storyline might be inspired from multiple sources but it's storyline has formed the basis for lots of movies, including "Inception", a fact accepted by Chris Nolan himself. Beautiful screenplay and very good set design wields a very unique and fascinating look to the movie. The special effects are very creative and realistic.Overall, "The Thirteenth Floor" is a must watch movie. It goes much beyond the average science fiction movie.

Also great were performances by Craig Bierko--who is always good (First found him when he stole the movie Sour Grapes from everyone around him) Gretchen Mol and Vincent Donofrio.This movies asks the question--what if we are all computer simulations?

		<shortDescription>Solid Effort, Though Somewhat Bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it had its flaws, this film was nevertheless entertaining. The leads were... um, adequate. Craig Bierko tries, but his character is never really given the depth the actor might need to be more compelling to the audience. It's watching a supporting role tie down a movie. The other two leads are similarly tepid: Muller-Stahl does his Dignified Old Guy schtick with his usual professionalism, while Gretchen Mol, though achingly lovely, never really inhabits her character. And most guys will care less, as she's one of the more "good gosh!" prettiest women working right now, in the Charlize-Theron/Virginia Madsen 40-ish sort of way. Vincent D'Onofrio and Dennis Haysbert are to blame for the worst performances, though. The normally solid D'Onofrio is borderline unwatchable as he attempts to channel John Malkovich using a bad wig; Haysbert plays a LAPD detective like John Shaft after a heavy meal. Beyond the performances and some fundamentally dumb dialogue, however, there's some entertainment to be had. The 1937 Los Angeles scenes are quite lovely, as is the overall noir-ish quality of the film. And the plot does keep you guessing right til the very end, more so than The Matrix did (for me, anyway) Minus one point for naked theft, though: watch if Bierko's apartment isn't EXACTLY the same one Harrison Ford inhabited in "Blade Runner." This film was not a financial success, which is a kind of shame. It's definitely worth renting, especially with a pizza and a couple of your geekier friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another in a long series of films about virtual reality. The movie does try to seriously explore the "life" of VR characters (basically Star Trek "holodeck" characters) and asks the question "what is reality?" in interesting ways. Unfortunately, the pacing seemed a little slow in the beginning. Also I was not very impressed by the acting of the film's star, Craig Bierko, at first. Eventually things begin to pick up and as different time periods and locations are shown, the movie became more interesting.I worked hard trying to figure out what was happening and for a while I thought I knew what was going on. But because of unexplained events about the VR world, I gave up by the end. In defense of the film, the sets, special effects and costumes are good. Except for Bierko, the acting was ok.One problem for me had to do with what effect a person being killed in the virtual world had on the real person who is plugged into the virtual reality program. Now a Star Trek Voyager episode presented a very clear answer. The Star Trek story involved a ship's crew who were put into hibernation on a long voyage and had virtual reality for entertainment. In the Voyager show the crew could be so scared and tortured in the VR world that the real person would die of heart failure. In The Thirteen Floor there are mind transfers and deaths of VR characters which affect real people. How this works is never explained. Virtual reality concepts have been popular in films for years but especially lately with the success of The Matrix. If you want to see another unusual look at this subject, then The Thirteenth Floor will deliver.</fullReview>

All in all, it's not a bad movie. The acting is average, and the ending is surprising. It *IS* hard to follow at times, so you may want to keep the remote control handy so you can rewind it at certain parts.Much better than ExistenZ.

		<fullReview>This movie is not bad, although you can see where it's going about 20 minutes before it gets there. It's pretty much a standard what's-real/what's-not xlated to modern VR terms.The central character is a Brendan Fraser clone, who is part of a development team working on a virtual reality sim designed to emulate 1930s Los Angeles, with virtual characters, etc. When the company president is butchered in an alleyway, all the signs point to him as the culprit. The how and why are the meat of the film. It's enough story to be entertaining for what is clearly an FX vehicle.Very little is made of the 30's LA connection (no real Hollywood connection, in other words), except for certain scenes used to "drive" around and show open, undeveloped space where no doubt there's none these days (The roads seem more highly developed, i.e., modern, than it seems they ought to be, but I can't say for sure -- and certainly this can be a "flaw" in the sim, not a "flaw" in the movie)It's primarily an exercise in "how can we make this into an apparently virtual world"? The FX are much more subtle in this than in "The Matrix", which it clearly begs comparison to. In the end, I'd have to say that "The Matrix" is better -- but this is certainly not a bad movie. I recommend it if you want something mildly entertaining but not overly deep.</fullReview>

The characters are intelligently drawn and the actors do a good job of portraying them. It's all very believable.If the film has a drawback, it is the pacing and the visual effects don't live up to the expectations developed by the marketing of the film. That aside, it's worth seeing, especially in a theater with excellent sound. There was one part of the movie where I thought a cat had actually gotten into the theater and a baby was crying.

		<fullReview>Unlike the strange feeling ExistenZ with Cronenberg's weird shapes and eerie, creepy feeling or the special effects/action/adventure/thriller-ladened Matrix, "The Thirteenth Floor" captures the more intellectual, environmental context of multiple-realities and in some ways is more true to sci-fi and dectective mysteries. The movie doesn't depend on special effects or weird distracting forms to keep the audience's attention. There is more emphasis on mood, deliberate feelings and emotions. Too many critics frowned on the slow, plodding pace (spoiled no doubt by the fast, high techo action that appears to be in vogue nowadays). Nevertheless, this movie has the virtual reality colors of 30's off-bright, washed out shading quality giving the whole virtual world a realistic mood of unreality. "The Thirteenth Floor" is a solid, high-end sci-fi movie that concentrates more on the people, the plot, the background atmosphere than the fancy blow them away summer extravaganza, more in line with quality motion pictures than just entertainment and profit. Except for the mostly American ending, this movie wins on many points, particularly the use of unknown actors and the stark parallel characters in multiple worlds unlike previous parallel universe stories. Elements of horror, fear, tension permeate this movie while at the same time it brings with it mystery, sympathy, and interest and the American "warm fuzzies" which may or may not be a plus. Finally, there is even a subtle or not so subtle ethical theme that eventually comes out of this movie which is only infrequently included in virtual reality movies which makes this movie much more compelling.

		<shortDescription>"An important piece of the modern science fiction movie puzzle"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the lack of high profile names in this feature, I think you could be forgiven for looking past it on the shelves of your local movie store. However, despite the low-key cast (though the faces of Vincent D'Onofrio, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Gretchen Mol will all no doubt be familiar), and somewhat limited special effects budget, this movie manages to deliver an intriguing and thought-provoking story which is an important piece of the modern science fiction movie puzzle.The movie's main cast, in particular Craig Bierko, deliver captivating and thoughtful performances, which compliment the film's subdued yet 'noir-ish' atmosphere. There are also influences from some of the movie's sci-fi predecessors such as Blade Runner, in particular the atmospheric lighting and photography style. In fact even the apartment in which Dirko's character (and the main protagonist) 'Douglas Hall' lives bears a striking resemblance to Deckard's futuristic digs in Ridley Scott's 1982 classic.The narrative shares some elements with films like The Matrix trilogy, Dark City, and more recently James Cameron's Avatar. However the magic of this movie lies more in the intimacy of the performances, rather than any big-budget Hollywood special effects; and though you may see the plot developments approaching from about a mile away, the movie still manages to leave you feeling satisfied as the curtain falls.Overall I scored this movie a 7/10, the only down sides being some elements of the plot which don't quite make sense. However more than 10 years on this is still a great film, and one which deserves a watch by anyone who enjoys not just a good sci-fi, but a good thriller to boot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just my humble opinion.I borrowed this movie from my brother who had it on VHS (my DVD player was in for repairs). I vaguely remember hearing about this movie but had never seen it. Well, much to my surprise this was an outstanding movie. I'd never seen any of these actors before (not that I can remember anyways) and for a movie with an all, more or less unknown cast, it did not disappoint.From beginning to end the story and the characters where much better than in the matrix. The story in this movie has depth and I did not feel I was being sold a "hollywood" thing here (for lack of a better way to put that). A quality gem. I can't believe I missed this one when it came out. Maybe the title made me think it was about something else, I don't know. I'm just glad I finally got to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From people's comments this seems to be one of those films that has polarised opinions. Whether they are discussing the acting, the plot, the science fiction, etc, for every opinion there seems to be an opposite one. One thing that people don't seem to talk about is the photography (or is it cinematography?) which I thought was beautifully done and is probably the one thing that impressed me most about the film. Generally I liked the whole movie and enjoyed the twist too. I read some reviews after I had seen it with a view to buying the DVD and was put off because they wrote about banal dialogue and wooden acting.But to hell with it, I can now see that plenty of other people disagree with that view so I will buy the DVD.A thought occurs to me, the type of critics who are always talking about the quality of the acting and dialogue are probably the people who value style over form. These are the people who would rather read novels by some trendy new writer who writes stylistic prose, is very descriptive and perhaps poetic but unfortunately has little idea of plot or pace. Meanwhile I would be reading something with interesting ideas wrapped up in a good story, e.g. some good Science Fiction.So, take this as a recommendation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great concept, poorly executed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic idea behind the movie was very interesting and it slowly built towards the climax where everything is revealed. Subtle hints are laid throughout the beginning of the movie, rather impressively, to lead you to the conclusion.However, there are some horribly cheesy lines in this movie that ruin some potentially good moments...as well as some terrible characters, i.e. Detective McBain and Whitney, that prevent this from being the movie I feel that it could be.After the main climax of the movie it becomes quite boring, but yet the movie continues. It makes what I feel is the point of the movie, seem less important than it should. Personally I thought it should have ended leaving the viewer questioning their existence and the morality of creating and destroying artificial intelligence rather than being happy that everything worked out ok in the end for the protagonist.Overall I enjoyed it though, despite its short-comings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film deals with virtual reality and as such has a long trail of antecedents dating back to the sixties. For long-standing Star Trek fans it's truly disappointing, because almost every concept explored in this film has already been developed more than ten years before in "The Next Generation" (See "Elementary, Dear Data" , "Ship in a Bottle" and "Future Imperfect").

		<shortDescription>A Real Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comparisons to other films is natural for this movie, since it comes on the heels as it does of a number of virtual reality movies. The idea, or rather the question of reality, goes back several thousand years: Since we can only interact with the world through our five senses, how do we really know if they are telling us the truth? In some ways, the most apt comparison might be the holodeck on the various Star Trek series and movies--with massive computer power, what happens when a virtual character attains some form consciousness? It it some form of being--some very compelling thoughts are triggered. The movie itself delves into these questions in a thoughtful way, without a lot of flashy but pointless special effects it can concentrate on character development and plot lines. Really quite a surprise, I expected something inane and simplistic, but this offered up a very deliberate attempt to tell a story of humanity being swallowed, or created, by technology.</fullReview>

Armin Mueller-Stahl, our only anchor, is on screen too briefly. Vincent D?Onofrio has Malkovich-esque moments.

		<shortDescription>The Thirteenth Floor has some nice ideas, but is hampered by poor execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film I really wish was better. It's got an interesting premise, if dated due to the release of The Matrix the exact same year, nice cinematography and competent acting (for the most part), but the script is really quite poor and doesn't have enough depth to satisfy the questions it raises.The film-noir style fits well with the plot, and has very nice photography throughout the film's separate worlds. though the whodunit aspect of the story is rather underwhelming. The simulated-reality theme that frames the movie I felt could have had more done with it. While it has some nice additions, I didn't feel as though the people who entered the virtual reality really were inhabiting another world for the first time. The method used to upload a person's consciousness into the simulation also seems very dated and implausible when viewed now.My biggest issue is that the whole simulation idea lacks definition. There are so many questions presented by the scenario, and the responses given feel flat and unsatisfying. Ultimately, the whole film is more frustrating than exciting.The Thirteenth Floor hasn't aged well. It shows promise, and has some nice visuals, but lacks depth and feels altogether unconvincing. Overall, it's more Johnny Mnemonic than The Matrix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Praise to the excellent direction and screenplay to Josef Rusnak and team! From magnificent Daniel F. Galouye's book "Simulacron 3" The plot may look simple at first sight, the world has created a new world within, through the use of technology, but the story will lead us to an even unknown dimension that not even The Matrix would as clearly set as The Thirteenth Floor. The music, rendering and camera angles just fit the standards (higher than the average though)There's a thick and refined work in here where Gretchen Mol and Vincent D'Onofrio take most credit for a delighting performance. Then the pace of the movie is, to my concern, dedicated to the complexity of the characters and the implications of a parallel life and even life after death, rather than tricky special effects. That's maybe why this film did not hit a wider audience? More questioning reality on film making please, this planet needs this!Definitely a film worth watching twice, keeping and cherishing.</fullReview>

And as we are carried across the wave of technology, we question who we really are, and is it our place to play God? The power of imagination falls into our hands, and with it, we dream of life. But are we really living inside the dream of someone else? In Science-Fiction, we cross into new frontiers, parallel worlds, and watch technology surpass our hopes and fears. We are captivated by stories with driven characters brought to life through the heart and soul of actors, and we are mesmerized by concepts that give way to movies such as The One, Thrill Seekers, and 5ive Days to Midnight. And now we ride the elevator up to the Thirteenth Floor, where we discover a world beyond worlds and love that will exist beyond time. And the definition of Science-Fiction opens the door to who we dream to be, but are we really nothing more but a ghost in the machine?</fullReview>

Craig Bierko is the star but really there are 4 co-stars in this film and they're all good. Bierko was great as Max Baer in the movie "Cinderella Man" and he's very good here too.

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Vertual reality movie where two parallel worlds exist at the same time in L.A Calif; One in the present and the other back in 1937 with the actors in the film having two different roles in both worlds. Computer genius Hannon Fuller, Armin Muller-Stahl, had created a world of his own taking place in 1937 L.A where he can do the things that he dreamed about, go out and date beautiful young women and have love affairs with them. One day in his "Dream world" Fuller come to a startling conclusion that almost strikes him senseless. Writing down the information that he came to he gives it to bartender Jerry Ashton, Vicent D'Onofrio, to give to John Ferguson, Craig Bierko, in that world of 1937 who's really Douglas Hall in the world of reality here; A close friend as well as colleague of Fuller in the computer company that he founded.Back in the present Fuller tries to get in touch with Douglas but is interrupted by someone who he obviously knows. When he goes outside the hotel from where he was making the phone call he's stabbed to death by that individual, what was so important that Fuller wanted to tell Douglas that cost him his life? The movie "The 13th Floor" has Douglas going back to the world of 1937 trying to retrieve and then find out what that important letter addressed to him contained but Ashton, who later read it, was not at all cooperative with him. It took almost the entire movie for Douglas to finally find out what was so shocking that it cost Fuller his life and Ashton his sanity. There's another piece of the puzzle put into the movie that has Fuller's daughter Gean(Gretchen Mol), who nobody in the film ever knew about, came on the scene to take over Fuller's computer company. It turned that Fuller left the company to her in his will just days before he was murdered. The truth that Douglas as well as Ashton found out is truly shocking and it explains why Fuller was murdered to keep it from surfacing. But there's an even bigger shock withing for both Douglas and the audience at the very end of the movie and it's absolutely mind-blowing. Not bad at all the film "The 13th Floor" does in some way make sense if you try to take it seriously. Nowhere as good at "The Matrix", that was released the same year 1999, in the special effects department but a notch or two above that movie when it comes to the feasibility of the story that it's telling you.</fullReview>

The setup and the premise were extremely interesting and it could have unfolded into an excellent masterpiece, but the idea wasn't used to its limits, unfortunately.Don't get me wrong, the movie is a solid choice if you like sci-fi/mystery movies, but it just really affects my opinion, whenever i see an awesome idea, that just simply does not get executed to its maximum potential. The whole different world idea was just excellent, but i would have liked to see different worlds, some interesting overlaps, maybe? This is a movie that should leave you brainstorming like a madman after finishing it, but it kind of chews all the information up for you and you just get presented with the final product, i would much rather try to figure out what really happened myself, but oh well, everyone is different, i suppose.Overall it is not bad, no the greatest sci-fi/mystery flick you will encounter, but it is worth a watch. The acting is decent, not outstanding, but for a movie of this caliber it is good enough.</fullReview>

He has spent much of his career in mediocre roles, but should be praised for the great actor he is. This should go right up alongside "Full Metal Jacket" and "Daredevil".Beyond that, this is a great mind-bending science fiction film, with virtual reality and worlds within worlds. Things may not be as they seem. In a very general sense, it shares some common themes with "Dark City", which came out around the same time. Strangely, "Dark City" is the better known film, though they are equally good science fiction detective stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1937, a man named Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) gives a note to Ashton (Vincent D'Onofrio), the bartender at a swank hotel, that's addressed to Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko). Fuller tells Ashton it's crucial that no one else sees the note, and that the information enclosed is of great importance. Moments later, Fuller transports himself to 1998. He's soon found murdered, and a shirt stained with Fuller's blood is found in Hall's apartment. Fuller and Hall both work for Intergraph Computer Systems, a cutting edge artificial intelligence firm, and the "past" Fuller was visiting was actually a stunningly realistic recreation of Los Angeles 50 years ago, complete with people you can meet and places you can visit, that exists only in a microchip. The message he left with Ashton, however, is real. Some people, including LAPD detective Larry McBain (Dennis Haysbert) believe Hall murdered Fuller to assume his position of leadership at Intergraph. Jane (Gretchen Mol), Fuller's daughter, soon arrives on the scene, and Hall finds himself infatuated; Hall is determined to clear his name, so with the help of Whitney (also played by (Vincent D'Onofrio), he into the virtual 1937 in hopes of discovering just what happened. The Thirteenth Floor makes copious use of digital effects technology to allow its characters to travel between 1937 and 1998 - ironically using computer technology to create a world that exists inside a computer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thirteenth Floor (1999): Dir: Josfe Rusack / Cast: Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'Onofrio, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Dennis Haysbert: While the title clichés its numeral, the film itself is clever with wonderful production values. A computer researcher transports himself through the mind back to 1937. He gives an envelope to a bartender, makes a phone call, then proceeds outside where he is murdered. Craig Bierko plays his partner who is framed for the murder. He encounters Gretchen Mol who was cut from her father's will only days before his murder. Effective art direction displays 1930's galore with director Josfe Rusack having fun with the constant plot twists. Unfortunately the film also becomes confusing at points but relies on effective casting. Bierko displays confusion and determination as to whether or not he is guilty of murder and whether the cards deal him well in the end. Mol is the key victim who discovers information about herself. Here again is another tragedy that is questionable in its dealings. Vincent D'Onofrio plays a bartender who factors in with ill results. Armin Mueller-Stahl is only seen in the opening before the murder but his role transpires throughout. Dennis Haysbert plays a detective investigating this bizarre case. Its virtual reality is not well explained but it plays on suspense as oppose to mindless action. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

And when the menace came back on we switched villains.Acting was good, especially the camp-thug barman who keeps the letter.Interesting to see the ultimate optimism, whereas its contemporary The Matrix was the opposite.

I love the 30s and 40s movie, so was hoping for more of that feel. But, no, it wasn't quite that. It's not as good as Dark City, not as clever as Exitenze, not as novel as the Matrix, to name some VR themed movies. By the end of the movie, I felt like, there were just too many loose ends, but not everyone will feel that way - especially people new to VR movies, because they will likely overlook a lot of problems. But all VR movies have believabiltiy issues - if I had seen this before so many other VR movies, I might have overlooked some things that bugged meHeck, in spite of being disappointed due to wanting a film noir, and maybe something a bit more original I watched it to the end, which is more than I can say for a lot of movies :)I think some people will really enjoy this* A bit of spoiler alert - You know what would be refreshing?

		<shortDescription>The Matrix's distant cousin that's been locked away in the attic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every synopsis I read of The Thirteenth Floor has the words 'mind-bending' written in it. Therefore I made sure I followed the story pretty closely so that I didn't miss anything. And, when the credits finally rolled, I had the whole story pretty much figured out.The Thirteenth Floor was released in 1999, not that many people probably heard of it as The Matrix came out in the same year and relates to a similar kind of concept. In The Thirteenth Floor, the world of today has created an alternate reality in a computer program (in short, the 'matrix'), however this computer programme is designed to look like 1930s America and people can jump in and out of the 1930s populations' bodies with the help of the right computer equipment.For the first hour or so, I wasn't so much confused (as the 'mind-bending' plot was basically The Matrix with a dose of Inception thrown in - a good ten years before its own rise to fame). I was more bored. Nothing that interesting seemed to be happening and what was really going on wasn't revealed until around the hour mark. And, I have to say that when I 'got' what was happening, I liked it. Nice touch.All in all The Thirteenth Floor has a nice idea behind it and the actors play their parts well. However, it will never be either The Matrix or Inception, as it suffers from a distinct lack of budget. I knew it wasn't a new movie when I saw it, but I didn't know the exact year. I would have put it somewhere in the eighties rather than a year where bullets were being slowed down and George Lucas gave us The Phantom Menace. Also, The Thirteenth Floor has no stars and absolutely no action (minus the odd fist fight and gunshot). Therefore it gives the film a bit of a 'made-for-TV' feel about it.Perhaps it's 'the thinking man's Matrix? Either way, I liked it - it was some good ol' fashioned sci-fi. Of course it goes without saying that it would have been better with Carrie Ann Moss in a leather catsuit.</fullReview>

concept of the Big Band Era provide Flappers,Great Sound and a picturesque illusion that is excellent.The illusion however we are reminded is only an illusion(computer generated)and that is one of the"flints as to the fire"when one of the illusions learns that there existence is defined by a computer simulated program.The Bartender named Ashton having acted improperly and opened a letter given to him to hold and deliver to a Douglas Hall.The Bartender is part of the cyber landscape that this prototype simulation has created and though he is part of the entertainment scenario located at the Wilshire Grand he shares an error that seems to be occurring with the simulation and that is they haven't ironed out all the kinks.This is part of the problem as the characters begin to share memory amongst those of real persons,coincidently who there lives are modeled after and an error unfolds into a confusing game of mistaken identity and murder.It is very early on in the film it is uncovered that Fuller,who is the creator of the simulation was itching to try the simulation and without following his rules used the program.The untried landscape,though largely complete, needed as prior suggested some work.It is perhaps why Fuller was murdered when upon returning to the starting point he is murdered by a person initially thought to be his partner.If you see in the credits that Douglas Hall is also John Furgason and as well only Doug and here is where the characters and the error in the simulation and if you will reality get mixed up.The inability to properly identify whose who or whats what is a clever attempt at an illusion.It is worth noting that the underpinning to the adventure is that Fuller may be credited with being a very successful computer engineer and as well it can be said of both Ashton and Douglas Hall they as well provide the appearance of acumen and a direct involvement with the computing company in whose building all this seems to occur.Part of the limit if you will is made by the film in that nothing leaves the machines in which they are created in and indeed this and much of the film occurs within the framework of the simulation.It is difficult to make something out of nothing or virtually nothing but this is what the premise to this film is all about.It is very difficult to believe that such would be the case however what makes reality the ultimate beneficiary of this who done it is that the medium needs to be believed and what better way to pin a murder on somebody than through a deadly game of cat and mouse.The unfolding storyline is that Fuller it is thought was using the machine to go back in time and using the simulation to solicit young women,who were more eager than he knew or perhaps ever knew because this is done mostly through suggestion and appearances.The Bartender plays the devils advocate in this suggestive idea however it is Douglass Hall who provides assistance to Fuller to regain his sense of identity with a walk through his experience.Though it is not ever entirely clear a love interest seems to be what is suggested as part of the unfolding storyline and in particular it requires a bit of a stretch as most of this film does in believing what is actually occurring.If there is another conceit that is disguised in this film it is in fact that though we are asked to consider the cyber space adventure as real it is not so much cyber space that is being sold but an idea about an alter ego and the alter ego wins.The cyber space simulation actually fails to hold and the characters come to life right in the very bedrooms of the characters that they were modeled after,which is a bit eerie but it is the conceit of a alter-ego that wins not the computer or in fact computing in general.This is not such an original script but a storyline that is not well developed indeed it would be well to suggest that the errors in the storyline are the errors in the simulation.The detective who guns down a dangerous John Furguson tells gretchen-mol to go back where ever you came from and this is as difficult to fathom as the film is to believe.The appearance of gretchen-mol,fullers daughter was not known to anyone even fullers partner and caught every-one a little bit off guard when she appears and from that point on provides a pivotal ability to unravel who is who.This as stated provides an interesting and even attractive illusion as to appearances and even further it does not so much excite the senses but ultimately fails to deliver the goods.Those goods are based on the premise that this motion picture is in fact nothing but a motion picture and not having anything to do with computing or computing software it merely provides a vehicle for an attractive look-see.The final scene is worthy of indeed success however it like the story line is merely a cardboard illusion providing only that two of the three people suppose to be dead now are very much alive and they have earned a future as indeed the are happy and secure with a scene that though imaginative in now suppose to be June 2024.A final thought and a recommendation.Attractive,colorful(I think those greens are beautiful) even somewhat intelligent.A worthwhile investment that I have watched more than once and with just as much interest as if I was watching it for the first time.A interesting film with of course possibilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the trend of "what is reality" movies in Hollywood continues, we've been introduced to 'The 13th Floor'. Now, many have said that this is just a pale clone of 'The Matrix', 'Dark City' and so on, and that watching this movie was a complete waste of time. I wouldn't really agree. Here are my pros and cons. Pros: 1) Makes you wonder about your own reality. 2) Kind of interesting story, at least to those who find consciousness and reality questions interesting. 3) There aren't many special effects, but they weren't needed anyway. If you were expecting fighting scenes as in 'The Matrix', you'll be disappointed badly. 4) Romantic, someplace even heart-breaking parts of plot (like, when Douglas Hall says to Jane Fuller: "How can you love me? I'm not even real").Cons: 1) Shallow character's personality. 2) Acting could've been much better. 3) Nothing very important happened in the first hour of the story. 4) Could've been deeper.If you liked movies like 'The Matrix', 'Dark City', 'Truman's Show' or 'Existenz', I recommend you to watch this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting movie. I really like the idea of creating a virtual world that is so much more. When you create a world that functions just like reality all on it's own, are the people who populate it really real? "I think, therefore I am." Does that apply or are they really just data and computer signals. (*spoilers*) I loved it when Ashton finds out that his world is made up, how he demands to know what gave them the right. I just had to agree. Okay, they created these people but what gives them the right to hijack their bodies and f***k with their lives. I thought it was great when the tables were turned on one of these simulations creators. I loved it when he was forced to recognize these sims. as real, living beings. I enjoyed it even more when he has to question his own existence. Does he have a soul? Is he real? He thought it was so much fun playing God. How does he like being the toy instead?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last review posted here describes the film as 'some bloke going back in time' - the reviewer must have been watching a different film or totally didn't get the whole idea of it!I watched this film as I had read that it had some influence on the Matrix. I can certainly see the links (eg: 'jacking in'), but where as the Matrix is a system of control governed by machines who have enslaved the human race, the idea in the 13th floor is one of humans in the future generating thousands of fake realities for their own entertainment.A very engrossing film - makes me think that perhaps in the Matrix Revolutions we may indeed find out that the 'real world' is in fact not real - as the main character in this film finds out about his own 'reality'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not compare to the Matrix!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright hello sci-fi fans, This is a fantastic movie, but is nothing like the matrix as someone claims. To explain the difference just briefly, the subject matter is similar, but one major flaw, the characters in Matrix are seen on the whole as the residual projections of themselves from their conscious minds. Others see them as they see themselves. The Thirteenth floor is different. It concerns itself more with the idea of the characters being actual simulations, programs (not too dissimiliar from the Oracle or the Agents in the Matrix), i.e. conscious and aware of their existance but only so far as we are. The film handles the subject matter completely differently and its reference points are completely different. I guess this is a rant about comparing the two. Please watch this movie if you like sci-fi, but not because you liked the Matrix. Judge each film on its own merits and only compare when two films are trying to tell the same story, not different ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really "not bad"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In looking at the reviews of this film before seeing it, I was surprised at the number of "not bad" comments I saw, and wondered what such a consensus meant in terms of the movie. Now, having seen the film, I have to add in my "not a bad flick" rating as well.The story line is creative and ambitious, and it should not spoil anything to say that this movie deals with perceptions of "reality" a la the Matrix (and others). However, the Thirteenth Floor distinguishes itself with a nicely inverted film noir twist which I found to be quite novel and thought provoking. Pretty nifty stuff.The problems with this film are two-fold: 1) The acting can get lackluster at times and is not helped by the script which is pretty drab in terms of dialogue 2) The movie in general suffers from lack of dramatic contour, and it feels much flatter than it should given what's happening. People's entire conceptions of the world are changing and the character's level of anxiety about this never seems to rise above one of disillusioned vexation--I think I'd be more than just a little p***ed off if I found out that my life was somehow "not real".That said, I would definitely recommend this movie and would recommend you see in several times. Though its not great, it's really not bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely worth seeing. (slight spoilers) Though it might be similar to Matrix, it focuses more on the simulation than on the real world. For example, in Matrix, the agents moved in and out of people's bodies, and we didn't see the consequences of that -- anybody in the Matrix was an enemy. In here, we see how that negatively affects the simulation's lives. Though I found it somewhat easy to predict, that didn't detract my enjoyment of the film. It is also multi-layered, so physicists will have fun with this, while ordinary people can understand most of it. However, it suffers from being too similar to some other movies.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about the dreams of software engineers made true. If you've ever experienced the satisfaction of programming with imagination, joy, and without imposed limits, you may enjoy this film twice than other spectators.Some people say the romantic side of this movie is a commercial ingredient. I strongly disagree. This romance is *not* a sweetener, but a philosophical question in artificial intelligence.Special effects are superb, because you don't notice them (well, you notice the laser beams of the computer room and the "eye tunnel" effect, but those are *not* the big special effects of the movie). The big effects are in the 30s scenarios: You need to get the DVD version, and take a look at a gallery where you can see the great work of compositing. Then, play the movie, and notice how cars and trams pass over a composited background, which you can see through the (moving) vehicles windows.Without the DVD version, it's impossible to realize where the effects are in the movie.The style of the movie remembered me of some sci-fi titles from the 80s. If you enjoyed to go to the cinema in the 80s for watching sci-fi movies, it's also very possible that you love this one.Another interesting fact is that this movie is radically different from the pretentious trailer or confusing VHS/DVD covers. In fact, I was very afraid of not liking the film because of the trailer and cover, but, fortunately, the movie is very different from them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The 13th floor" is an adaptation of Daniel Galouye's novel "Simulacron 3", published in the early sixties. What amazed me was that the spirit of the novel was closely preserved, although it is quite a tricky book.The movie is tricky too, but the plot is understandable if you pay a little attention to it. Do NOT try to anticipate the twists - it's humanly impossible.Yet, this movie is far from being perfect: character development is weak, actors are a little contrived and the direction, although competent, is not stylistically daring. Typical Hollywood ingredients (the romance between the two main characters, the ugly bartender in the 1970's world, the cop who's waiting in the wings...) unfortunately belittle the merits of the story. In fact, I'm not sure this movie would make the same big impression after a second viewing. No scene is memorable and would justify in itself a second viewing. The movie never goes as far as its base line would imply it to go. It seems that all the people involved (the director, the writer, the actors) were so aware of the potential of the story that they refused to take any risk of spoiling it with their own initiative.Anyway, the first viewing will certainly give many people pleasure and food for thought.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caught the beginning credits of this movie on HBO and found myself unable to change the channel. I guess that says something for a guy that typically does not enjoy sci-fi.The cast is initially what interested me. It was the twists and turns of the plot that kept me. I first saw Bierko in a guest appearance on Wings. Very funny, good screen presence. I was glad to see him get a starring role and truth be told he was very good. Mueller-Stahl was terrific in the Barry Levinson picture Avalon. I have always been a fan of Vincent D'Onofrio, who can forget Dennis Haysbert as Cerano in Major League, and one look at Gretchen Mol should say enough.The plot is thought provoking as we learn more each day about virtual reality and computer capabilities.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but a shallow movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thirteenth Floor" is a mix of sci-fi, mystery, spiritual, romance and action. My review is mostly about a spiritual side of the plot.There are 3 main spiritual ideas in the movie: 1. Transfer of consciousness 2. Creation of virtually programmed world 3. Multi-layered realityGlued together these thrilling ideas are working entertaining, but not answering the main question: How the developers of the virtual world created a consciousness?This question is not only non-answered, but it's totally ignored and leading to the number of other doubts: 1. Where the consciousness of the virtual people disappears when an upper-level entities-hosts enter their bodies? 2. How a virtual person remembers what his host has been doing in his body?And so on?We have to remember that creation of consciousness is a sacral magic with access by only ONE- our Spiritual Father. The gang of three from 1990 could build a virtual world, but could NOT create a consciousness, which means they COULD NOT move their own consciousness into the virtual world.The love represented in the plot is hastily done too: a woman from the upper layer is cheating her husband with a virtual character. Her explanation of that - the virtual character is nice, that why she falls in love with him.The movie is ended abruptly without providing any explanation what actually this multilayered "matryoshka" means.There are randomly dropped spiritually fancy words and phrases in the plot such as déj? vu, "not in this life", soul, etc. However, they are not corresponding any further explanations.I have to admit that the "vinaigrette" content has been packaged in entertaining way and probably gained a commercial success, HOWEVER, we have to be aware that trash movies could be far more dangerous than trash loans with more unpredictable and dangerous consequences for humankind. What is a learning message? I guess nobody knows. I m generously rating this movie by 2 stars for entertaining fantasy ONLY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed "The Thirteenth Floor" far more than "Matrix". I'm a happily married adult. I do not consider Reality to be controlled by an Evil Cyborg Conspiracy (probably not by coincidence resembling the Drug Enforcement Agency) which is the basic worldview of "Matrix". I personally think Keenu Reeves running around with machine pistols engaging in psychotic suicidal acts of armed terrorism against the Establishment displays the mindset of folks who fly jets into the Pentagon. As a professional soldier in the U.S. Army, that aspect of "Matrix" really didn't appeal to me."The Thirteenth Floor" isn't like that. It's more like one those Star Trek holochamber episodes set in Dashiel Hammett's 1930s. The violence is kept to about a "Maltese Falcon" level, and the good guy isn't a terrorist. The vision of the human future it leaves you with is humanity friendly, unlike the rather morbid view of Ultimate Reality in "Matrix".The idea of having our own private little 1930s virtual reality to step into is something an American Movie Classics/ Turner Classic Movies fan like myself could really get into. I would love to see a "13th Floor" sequel or series someday.The only thing that really bothered me was the wuss premise that 1990s folks taking possession of the 1930s folks ala Sam Becket in "Quantum Leap" was inherently wrong. I would think that would depend on whose identity you put yourself into and what you did with their identity while you had it. The "reality is unreal" bit didn't bother me at all. I've pretty much suspected that for years.</fullReview>

This is a not thinking man's Matrix. The two movies shared an immersion virtual reality, true, but the basic similarity ends there. The Matrix was a teenagers REAL ACTION comic book, shoot 'em up, sex, shoot 'em up, throw in some cyber stuff, shoot 'em up. I do admit one doesn't tire easily of looking at Carrie Moss. But the Matrix was made for teenage Boys. I believe the Brothers even admitted this in an interview. In the Thirteenth Floor you are confronted with completely contained linked nested vr worlds, each linked, but each a complete entire world. Even the vr characters of one level develop amnesia when being inhabited from another psyche from a vr world outside of it. This is thoughtful, good stuff. Film noir, VR, Mystery Novel, Cyber SF all wrapped in one tidy, well executed package. I loved it and yes, Roland, you are a very bright guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the precedents established by various "Star trek" episodes, etc. (and I'm not counting the Matrix, since this film was probably in post production when Matrix was released), "Thirteenth Floor" was the type of S-F film I would have died to have seen as a kid in the sixties and early seventies.Galouye and many of his colleagues at Galaxy would have been proud of this little film: Thoughtful S-F done in a muted classy way. No slapdash hokum, it's tone reminds me of "Gattica." Though the question of reality has been done before, "Floor" still manages to pleasantly surprise and do so in an intelligent manner.Nobody connected with "Floor," was looking to cash in on the "Matrix," a welcome addition to the S-F film canon as any (and my choice to supplant "Blade Runner" as the greatest S-F movie to date), I just get the impression that it was made by people who care about S-F and movie craftsmanship.</fullReview>

The story was contained in his work of Tsuong Tse. He lived in where now known as the Shangtung Province of China, 4 centuries B.C.The 13th floor affords an entertaining and reasonably thought-provoking reading. The story telling is orderly performed - not entirely an easy task when our hero shuttles amongst three interwoven `realities'. In the relevant scenes the nostalgic atmosphere of the 30's is well brought out. Some viewers discredited this film because the theme is `not original', it being preceded by Star Trek, the Matrix and eXistenZ etc. - well, I do not think criticism on that ground is fair. After all, if 2,400 years ago Tsuong Tse was intrigued and had questioned the reality of the reality, how can any work built on this plot line be truly original?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie without much publicity (I hadn't even heard of it before I saw it last night on HBO, even though it's quite new) and without any stars in it (except Armin, which nevertheless is not THAT famous) the movie certainly came as a pleasant surprise. I am beginning to think that perhaps because there were no stars in it it was so good. The director didn't feel compelled to adjust the parts to the actors' personalities, or to exaggerate them in any way.Another thing I absolutely liked was the almost complete lack of fist fights!! There were some (I suppose that's inevitable) but much less than in other so-called science-fiction movies. Instead, the movie is mostly based on mysteries, clues and the search for the truth... in everything. You'll see what I mean if you watch the movie :). You'll doubt yourself and your assumptions about reality the whole way through.And another interesting thing: when the end came and all mysteries were solved, I thought: "Well, it was obvious THAT was it... but why didn't I see it before?" What I mean is the solution is the expected one, but nevertheless you don't see it so easily. Or perhaps you will see it easier than I did :).All in all the movie is quite classic... don't expect any weird stuff, cool special effects or things like that. But I enjoyed it very much, much more than other more famous movies full of themselves (if you can say that about a movie :) but which failed to touch me in the end.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see "The Matrix" I wasn't very impressed. The effects were ok, but the story was badly done. And It reminded me of a German movie I had seen a long time ago, except it was better done. It was from 1974 called "Welt am Draht"(world on a wire) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. 25 years later it gets remade as "The 13th Floor". And BOTH films are based on the book "Simulacron-3" by Daniel F. Galouye, he wrote it in 1964! This was a writer with vision and creativity, to invent super computers, virtual reality, software which becomes sentient that far back, that's quite and achievement. "The 13th floor" takes its time to tell an intelligent story, it's not brainless shooting and running and mindless cliching all the way ("You are the one who has been foretold" yadda yadda).If you download your mind to the dustbin before watching movies, go see "The Matrix" again - if you like to speculate just a little bit, go for "The 13th floor" - and visually, I think its better there as well. The pace is slower, but view is greater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>despite the fact, that many european moviebuffs have to rely on video or dvd (as it was not shown in some countries), it is in fact worth every cent/penny/whatever one spends to get a great piece of s/f that comes without the sfx-armageddon one usually expects in that genre (in fact, there is, but VERY hard to tell).Wonderfully directed and acted, it is based on a novel and a teleplay that was aired in the seventies in Germany.I guess some of the reasons "13th" failed to become a blockbuster was a) the lack of "u.s. superstars" and b) that awkward feeling it leaves in the viewer for a long time after he left the theatre.But if one is out for intelligent entertainment, one should definitely miss this piece.</fullReview>

Fishburne the success would be greater than The Matrix 'cause the script is better than the other and keeps you seated all the time. It doesn't need the special effects to keep you interested.

		<shortDescription>Good movie worth having</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good movie. I first saw the previews for it in the theatre, and it looked really cool, but I never had a chance to see it there. I saw it again in bits and pieces on cable a few months later, but you really need to see the whole story from start to finish to really understand it. It is a hard movie to understand for some people, but once you get the concept of the movie and watch it, it is very enjoyable.I bought the DVD after I saw it again on video, and the DVD makes the experience more enjoyable. This is not a rip-off of The Matrix, but has a few similar concepts. I don't think it did that well at the box office because it was released at the same time The Matrix was, and didn't have the more well-known actors and actresses. I also think that just watching it the first time in the theatres may have confused some people who didn't see the entire story.It's not a perfect movie, but it's well worth renting at watching, and even owning on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another underrated gem...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, maybe not quite a "gem." But a very decent movie and, if you're a sucker for love stories (which, at some level, I still am), surprisingly touching. I don't understand why it got so terribly slammed by critics; even if it's been done before, it's well plotted, pretty well paced, and has some striking visual effects; the acting is subdued but it grows on you. Craig Bierko, as the lead character (who looks like a cross btw. George Clooney and Michael Keaton, if you can imagine that), actually gets more interesting when he's not such a goody-good-guy.Similarities to "Dark City" and "the Matrix" (esp. "DC") have already been pointed out, and they are obvious. But I saw "13F" quite soon after seeing the other two (both of which I liked), and I still thought it stood up to them. It's a tighter film, and it has a quieter impact. More than either of them, it really questions man's right to play God; both "City" and "Matrix" start out showing the negative side of that scientific god-complex but end up transferring that right to one special man, while "13F," in good old-fashioned sci-fi style, sticks truest to showing the moral dangers involved.One small quibble (not really a spoiler, just a detail): why the continual harping on the shoes? There doesn't seem to be any particular reason why you'd have to take off your shoes to enter the simulation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a much better movie than it's given credit for. True, it has its faults -- Vincent Donofrio's acting, as usual, makes William Shatner's look subtle and restrained -- but it in no way deserved to die at the box office. Some people seem to think that this whole what-is-reality thing started with The Matrix, or at best Dark City. No, The Thirteenth Floor does not have an original concept, and neither do the two previously mentioned movies. There are about a half-dozen Twilight Zone episodes alone on this theme. In fact, the theme is almost a cliche in fantasy and science fiction. Originality is not the point here; the style in which the story is told is what matters. I'd rate Dark City the highest among these three films, with TTF second. I realize this is a heretical opinion in many circles, but I thought The Matrix was a lunkheaded cheeseball chop-sockey fest. Not one character in that film even approaches the complexity of Gretchen Mol's character in TTF. And I say this as a fan of action movies and science fiction. By the way, the historical accuracy of the recreation of the 1930's in this film is impeccable. If this film has a serious flaw, it's that the 1930's world is so much more interesting than the 1990's, one wishes more time were spent in it.</fullReview>

Will it be moral for a programmer to have sex with the artificial persons he created? Can he murder them? Who created OUR universe, what if WE are nothing but a simulation in God's computer? "The Thirteenth Floor" really surprised me for the profound ethical and philosophical questions inherent in the plot. This is the essence of true Science Fiction (as opposed to "sci-fi", or "space opera"): imagine a technical advancement and try to figure out its implications. We have here a very intelligent movie. I give it a "10", "must see", for the way the basic idea was handled. On the other hand, the photography could be better, the plot could be better, and the last scene was glued on just to bring the hero back from the dead. But these are small details, this film is still worth a 10. Too bad they didn't have the special effects budget that brain dead "Matrix" got.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's been a recent rash of these virtual reality films. The Matrix, Pleasantville and The Truman Show are signs of the disease, The Thirteenth Floor the most recent symptom. If you liked The Matrix a lot, well you probably will hate The Thirteenth Floor. If you found the Matrix to be well made but nothing new, you might consider The Thirteenth Floor to be pretty entertaining. Two computer scientists Hannon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) and Douglas (Craig Bierko) along with programmer Whitney (Vincent D'Ofrino) have created a virtual 1930's urban world. Hannon has been "jacking in" to his cyberspace, enjoying a salacious life of sex with his virtual girlfriends. These fellows were obviously excellent programmers! Anyway Hannan gets murdered and Douglas looks like he's going to get the blame. To complicate matters Jane (Gretchen Mol) turns up and claims to be Hannon's daughter. Douglas starts jacking into the virtual world to find out who really did the deed. Sleuths among you will enjoy The Thirteenth Floor. This plot really does twist and turn. We don't only have multiple personalities to confound common sense, but also multiple universes. Director Josef Rusnak has adopted an understated style for his actors which tends to accentuate the more cerebral aspects of the movie. Some will like this, some won't. Craig Bierko especially is striking in this regard. Some may remember him as the villain in The Long Kiss Goodnight. The memorably named Gretchen Mol was Matt Damon's girlfriend in Rounders and rounds The Thirteenth floor out pretty nicely. This isn't really a special effects movie but more a sleuth flick with a sci-fi taint. It's purposefully gloomy but is a good thinking movie goers Matrix.</fullReview>

Unfortunately I didn't have the chance to see this series entirely, but the storyline got me excited for at least ten years up to now. I hardly remember the actors from the original, but Armin Mueller-Stahl acts as he'd been doing it at that time, too. "13th Floor" really is a great movie (a bit too much of love-scenes), but anyway: I'd like too see the original series once again. Don't try to compare "Matrix" and "13th Floor", they're kind of similar, but both movies take a different point of view on the "cyberspace reality".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie three times now and finally feel that I can follow it completely all the way through. It's very serious and complex, and if you're expecting "The Matrix," you're in the wrong place.The thing that kept drawing me back to this movie is that it captures something that is much more than the sum of its parts: it's not in the storyline, and I don't think it was really "intended" by the filmmakers, but this movie achieves a kind of grieving sadness that I think just arises out of the nature of some of the scenes.It comes out in a few ways: this nostalgiac yearning for the Los Angeles of the '30s, this wish to create another life and another cast of characters for yourself... and especially the scenes (and there are many) in which characters seem to know one another, but have never met, or in the most affecting scene (the one in the supermarket) where one character knows another one very well, but that other character has no idea who the first one is. Not to mention the fact that when the characters realize that they're just players in a game someone else has created, their lives lose all meaning.Anyway, between this and The Matrix, this is the one I'm going to buy when it comes out on DVD. In terms of emotional content, this film is the closest thing to Blade Runner that I've seen in the years since that film. See it, but don't expect "the thrill ride of the summer."--- Check out my website devoted to bad and cheesy movies at: www.cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

And unlike many visual fests, its sci-fi noir content is very strong in its lyrical constructed worlds. The colors are consciously culled from the spectrum for mood and definition (watch for it and you'll understand) and the characters (whether intentionally or not) act very wary and unsure of their own presence. It's a statement on existence, perception, and ultimately our own constructed realities in life and cinema. Unfortunately grossly underrated film, I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a Matrix clone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not agree with the people here who are claiming that this film is a Matrix clone. The 2 movies are only superficially linked. Yes they both deal with virtual reality and simulated universes, but they are otherwise very different.As some have already stated, Matrix has glossier special effects. So what? Thirteenth Floor has a much better (and more plausible) plot. As a long-time science fiction lover, I believe that TF is great science fiction with a plot that holds together, once the original "suspension of disbelief" has occurred. Matrix, on the other hand, requires you to "suspend disbelief" all through the movie! Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Matrix, but it simply wasn't on the level of TF. (For example, I had a hard time not outright laughing at the preposterousness of using live bodies as batteries. The life support system for these bodies would use more energy than the energy gleaned from the bodies themselves. I do suspect that this is a detail that only a long time science fiction lover would care about.)I suspect that those who preferred Matrix might also be those who would claim that Phantom Menace is great science fiction which it is not. Phantom Menace is great fun and a treat for the eyes, but serious science fiction, it is not.I would recommend that people see both movies. However, if you're mainly looking for glitzy effects and are "bored" by serious plots with little action, then you might choose to skip TF. On the other hand, if you are an experienced science fiction aficionado, I strongly suggest that you see TF.</fullReview>

He is murdered as he is testing the system. It becomes a murder mystery. LAPD detective Larry McBain (Dennis Haysbert) investigates. Hannon's mysterious estranged daughter Jane (Gretchen Mol) shows up. Hannon's second Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko) finds himself the primary suspect. There's a techie named Jason Whitney (Vincent D'Onofrio). There may be clues to Hannon's murder in the simulation.This has no tension, no suspense, and no pace. Released around the same time as 'The Matrix', this doesn't have any of its excitement. The simulated world has no excitement. Craig Bierko never had the leading man feel. While I like the attempt, it doesn't achieve anything good. I couldn't care about Bierko as an actor or his character. The movie uses each actor in duo roles in both real world and simulated world.

		<fullReview>If you've read the "My big TOE (Theory of Everything)" books then this movie comes pretty close to a fictional adaptation. Not long ago Jim Elvidge wrote a book "The Universe Solved." Whereby he postulates that in accordance with Moore's law, the current state of technology (2012) is only ten years away from being able to create the "Matrix." So, we now know that the possibility of creating a Matrix is no longer fiction. Therefore, if we have the technology to create such a realistic virtual world who's to say that it wasn't created already and that we're not living in it. I'm sure we've all felt that way once in a while (after all, it's those feelings that cause creative people to write movies like "The Thirteenth Floor" and "The Matrix").Quite honestly, I liked this movie far more than the Matrix because is was more grounded in reality. I also liked the way they powered down the screen at the end. Hinting, what everyone is thinking, is the final world also a simulation?If you haven't seen this movie, then see it!

The contrast of the past and present is astounding, this murder mystery oozes atmosphere. Craig Bierko plays Douglas Hall who cannot recall the night his colleague was murdered. Now a suspect he tries to uncover the truth, but the reality is harsher than he could ever imagine.With a twisting script based on the book by Daniel F.

Just suffice to say: there is a Murder. You will be presented with some obvious Suspects, a plausible motive, and some nagging questions. Then you follow the clues as they appear. Then when the end comes, it will be a nice elegant plot cap.Unfortunately, Sci-Fi is often branded as Action/Adventure and the few attempts to sidestep the popular mold get miscast and thrown aside for being "Slow &amp; Boring". And the added obstacle for this Movie is the immediate comparisons to MATRIX.Think of it this way.

		<fullReview>Rarely does a film come along which can truly be called unique. In fact, uniqueness in cinema may even be no longer attainable.In The Thirteenth Floor, individual performances collaborate into the fantasy storyline and, put simply, make the storyline work. Craig Bierko's multiplicity as Douglas Hall (his 1999 persona) and John Ferguson (1937) is reminiscant of classic movie performances. Gretchen Mol provides just enough - but not too much - range into each of her characters to be believable in a fiction setting; and the always reliable Armin Mueller-Stahl is charming with a bit of an edge in his 1937 character's setting.Additionally, Vincent D'Onofrio should not be missed in his eccentric roles as a computer programmer/1937 bartender, a contrast to his Det. Goran character on "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent." Other notable performances in the remainder of the cast include some now-familiar names, such as Shiri Appleby ("Roswell"), Dennis Haysbert ("24") and Allison Lohman ("White Oleander") If there is anything wrong with The Thirteenth Floor, it would be the unwarranted comparisons to The Matrix, which came out in relatively close proximity. In contrast to The Matrix, the moviegoer will actually came away from the experience understanding what happened; and, not to mention, Keanu Reeves can't hold a candle to Bierko's acting chops.The Thirteenth Floor, with it's duplistic parrallels in tact, is more than worth two hours of enjoyment.

		<fullReview>I've been kind of spoiled by the Matrix movies, where any sci-fi or action movie that I have seen since has disappointed me, all because it did not measure up well against the Matrix in terms of plot, special effects, or incredible action. It seems the Matrix raised the bar too high.However, I found this little gem of a movie, and it is the first post-Matrix sci-fi movie that I have actually liked! And I liked it a lot! The themes of the two movies are similar, but this is no Matrix-clone. The action is almost non-existent, so it relies more on thinking and story-telling. You can read other posts if you want to learn about the plot, and they are accurate so there's no need for me to repeat them. The acting in this movie was very good, even though I have never seen much of these actors before (except for D'Onofrio, who acting style I usually hate in Law &amp; Order btw, but he's very good in this film). The story contains plenty of twists to keep you entertained and thinking throughout the entire movie. And most importantly, it is a movie that you continue to think about (in a good way) AFTER the movie is over. I'm looking forward to watching it again, with my wife this time, so it has re-playability and is a good candidate for purchase instead of rental.For anyone interested in seeing a very good movie with a Matrix-like plot, make sure to get this film. As I said before, I'm very spoiled when it comes to sci-fi films now, thanks to the first 2 Matrix films, but this movie managed to stand up very well in comparison. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film, and recommend it to sci-fi fans, and non-sci-fi fans, whole-heartedly. But don't expect a wham-bam Matrix-clone. It's really in the same category as films like "Gattaca" (another great flick).9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT a Matrix knock-off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie came-out, many people I know called it a "poor man's Matrix". I can see their point, to a degree; Matrix had cooler effects, better action sequences and more notable actors in the lead roles than the 13th Floor. But there the similarity ends.True, the FX from the first Matrix movie were fantastic and ground-breaking, but what else about it, as well as the two films that followed it, do people give high praise for? Not the story line. And not the acting either. Of the whole cast, only Laurence Fishburne did anything that can be remotely considered "acting".Don't get me wrong, "The Matrix" is a great movie for what it is; but "The 13th Floor" is a great movie for something else entirely. It is a compelling story with real characters, and it didn't bog itself down by trying to be too apocryphal.Of all the actors in this movie, only Vincent D'Onofrio (and perhaps Dennis Haysbert, thanks to "24") would be considered a household name, and that's all right too. A movie this intelligent should not be overshadowed by the actors playing it out.Let me just say at this point that Vincent D'Onofrio is one of the best actors in Hollywood; he simply does not do a bad job, ever. If you haven't seen him on Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent, check it out; even if you're not an L&amp;O fan, it's worth watching just to see him operate.But I digress... sci-fi movies, much more often than not, are either wildly overblown, over hyped or over-FX'd, or they are campy and seriously exempt of any intelligent thought at all. The idea behind the Matrix, for example, was a very original idea; it would have stood on its own very well, I think, even without all the wall-walking and slo-mo gun battles. The 13th Floor is similarly crafty, proffering the notion that not only can one create a virtual world, but that a character from that world can re-inhabit our bodies should we die in that world. Kudos to the writers that came up with it.Had I been casting this movie, I may not have cast Craig Bierko - even though he hasn't had much acting experience in a lead role, you have to admit he's got two of the best eyes in the biz! Gretchen Mol I didn't know much about either, but I think both of them did just fine in the finished product.As a lifelong fan of the Sci-Fi genre, I highly recommend this movie, as long as you go in with an open mind; if your kind of movie is the kind where you can basically switch your brain off for the duration and you can marvel at all the pretty explosions, than this movie isn't for you. But if you like clever, intelligent cinema, you will like this film.My score: 9For similarly well-written and well-acted sci-fi movies, I would also recommend "Dark City" and "The Arrival".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost... there is no time-travel involved in this movie... I dun understand how can some reviewers use terms like 'flashback' and 'time-travel'. And then again it's not about how or what they've shown the 1930's to be like or why wasn't it the 1960's. And it's not relevant that the lead actor becomes a bank clerk in the simulation.**** SPOILERS *****The essence of the movie is in it's theme. It's about the concept of a simulation inside a simulation. Something which is nicely brought out in the way the story unfolds. I'm sure most of the ppl. are not that smart to figure this out in the first hour of the movie... and it is meant to be like that. So I dun understand why people keep blabbering about the movie being too predictable or anti-climactic. hah... a good lot need to see the movie twice perhaps... true there r some flip-ups and it's not the BEST science fiction thriller ever... but it sure is still far above average.My vote: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thirteenth Floor illustrates a created reality within a created reality and briefly illustrates the original creating reality (all that is known or allowed to be known/displayed at that time).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN!This movie is akin to The Matrix in its illustration of alternate/parallel/hierarchal realities and/or existences. Additionally, it runs some parallels with The Game, starring Michael Douglas.It openly depicts three separate realities stacked one upon the other, the stacking being determined by the amount of conscious awareness of the creators of each, respectively.From a philosophical and spiritual viewpoint, at least one major teacher has touched upon this subject matter with his statement, "In my Father's house there are many mansions".From some quantum mechanics physicists' viewpoints, such occurrences are only a matter of time, if they have not already actually begun in the ordinary 3-D reality. Some quantum physicists categorize such situations as "virtual reality".Computer Technology is based upon and was created by human consciousness; humans created computers. Super-humans or God (gods) created humans, with or without computers. Consciousness itself creates. This movie deals with consciousness using computers to create, therefore, it can be considered an analogy for human consciousness.Key words and phrases in the movie regarding truths in the reality are (please note that some quotes are summarily only): "How many worlds are there?" "Thousands." "I'm not even real." "You have a soul, Fuller did." "You can't just plug your brain/mind into this thing and not expect to be affected by it." "These people are real; they as real as you and me." "I am a reflection of his character profile." References to deja vu and "in another life". "Now we can beat the s**t out of and try to drown one another; that's always fun.""I think, therefore I am" - Descartes.Naturally, these realizations, if accepted, can lead to deeper seeking for answers to the reality(s). This movie is classified as "fiction with a purpose". It can be considered an analogous teaching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific performances from Craig Bierko and Vincent D'Onofrio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of my favorite sci-fi suspenses. Filled with a provocative cast of actors and a much more plausible plot than The Matrix, I was thoroughly pleased with The Thirteenth Floor. Not a huge actress yet, Gretchen Mol (Rounders) is captivating as Jane Fuller. This movie questions our existence, overwhelming the viewer with questions and doubts. The movie expertly captures the era of the 1930's with fashion, music, and nostalgia. What I loved about this movie was the mystery surrounding Hanan Fuller's (Armin Mueller-Stahl) murder. The Thirteenth Floor will leave you very satisfied, as well as uncertain of mankind's being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, one of my all time favourites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comments about this film divide into two camps: (A) unoriginal plot and not as good as The Matrix, and not a good cast; (B) wonderful, carefully made and thoughful sci-fi thriller, with a fine cast.I am firmly in camp B!I found some plot concepts similar to The Matrix, but only on a very basic level (to say this film is a clone of The Matrix is like saying that Pale Rider is a clone of High Noon because both are about guns, horses and sheriffs). But my jaw dropped when I listened to the Director's Commentary (on DVD) and learned that this film is based on a sci-fi book written in the early 1960s (before the microprocessor was invented, by the way).What makes this film for me, apart from the cast (all of the leads are truly excellent, in particular Bierko), is the beautiful photography/cinematography. Most scenes - even interior scenes - are shot mainly using natural light - listen to the Director's Commentary and have your eyes opened. I would add that I find the recreation of 1930's LA stunning, better than Bugsy or other recent attempts (but not as good as Some Like it Hot's prohibition era!).I find many similarities in visual style with another of my favourite sci-fi films, Gattaca: the careful colour palettes, the use of stunning modern architecture and designer furniture, the use of sepia tones to show the past (or here 60% colour 40% b/w film stock, apparently), wonderful costumes and lighting, the careful pace throughout - maybe also one could say that Gretchen Mol and Uma Thurman have the same chilly stylish beauty. Also perhaps there is a basic similarity in the very concept of a sci-fi film which is in fact a who-dun-it.An important element of filmgoing, for me, is the magic of the experience, or the 'willing suspension of disbelief' (Coleridge). This film has it in spades. Therefore 10/10, I say, and a film which I can happily watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than it starts and worth sticking with, even if it is now more predictable than it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannon Fuller is a computer scientist who has developed a virtual reality world, into which one can plug in. One time he makes a frightening discovery and tries to tell his colleague Douglas Hall, but is killed before he can. With the clues pointing to Douglas himself, he is forced to hunt the killer in the virtual world through clues left by Fuller. However the clues lead him beyond the solution of a murder.The problem with virtual reality films is that they are no longer as fresh and twisty as they think they are. That is the thing here, while it is a great little film, the conclusion and twists are not as surprising as they should be simply because we have been taught to expect them by things like Matrix, Dark City and so on. However this is still a good film and, although not as great as those, is still worth remembering in the same breath!The film starts with difficulty in some regards as it is difficult to entirely get a grip on what is happening. However it gets better as the pieces start to fall into place, although it is the second half before things start making sense. The various realities are hard to make sense of, and the delivery of the film sometimes makes the characters hard to keep track of - the eyeball thing not being as effective as the device some other films have used to portray a similar `shift'. The effects are quite good considering the budget involved, but those expecting it to compare to Matrix will be disappointed. Like wise the cast are a slightly lower-rent type, although still good. Bierko has a distinctive look to him and he makes a good lead figure here. D'Onofrio is less convincing but still gives a good performance. Mol does well but she doesn't have distinctive looks, meaning that, until her character becomes clearer it is hard to keep track of her. Mueller-Stahl adds class but I would like to see a film soon where he doesn't just play a small role which adds class!Overall, this is an enjoyable and clever film but the delivery lets itself down a little bit - being too confusing for the first half and ultimately too obvious at the end. However I expected some rubbish video sci-fi and I was pleasantly surprised by the whole film. It may not stand up to it's bigger brothers and, watching it in 2004, it may not be anything new or different, but it is enjoyable for fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another missed opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a bad movie. But in the end, despite the good story and the excellent cinematography, it's rather average. It could have been so much more. A talented team could have done something as outstanding as "Blade Runner" with this story.The basic script is packed with good ideas, familiar to SF literature addicts, about created realities and the way they interact. Basically, the concept is the same as in "Tron", as we have real people entering the computerized artificial world they created. Remember: "Tron" had the same exact line: "my user"... But this script goes further, and that's the nifty trick: the creators of the worlds are themselves part of an artificial world created by others (with the implication: "when will it stop?" eh eh...)... nested realities, nice, isn't it? Not very original as far as SF literature goes, but for a mainstream movie, it's rather remarkable.The main problem with this movie is that the basic idea is frightening, though the movie is not. It's not frightening because the characters are not frightened, only surprised, when they learn they are actually artificial. So there is no real tension, at the emotional level, which is a huge flaw for a story like this one. Anyone discovering he lives in a 100% artificial world would collapse, so imagine you learn you not only live in an artificial world, but are actually artificial yourself..! What were they thinking when conceiving these scenes?Well the other very bad aspect of "Thirteenth" is that the screenplay is an ignorant formulaic mish-mash, made of dead flat, poor and contrived lines, that sound much like being out of a TV cheap soap. Very irritating in places.The acting is vaguely adequate, with a big plus for d'Onofrio who kinda tries to save the day, and doesn't really succeed. But what could have they done with such a screenplay anyway?Then the FX... when I saw this movie, I thought it was from 1985 or so... 1999???? What the..? Very poorly conceived visual effects, with this 80's feel (stage lasers beams?! Ouch!).So what's left? Well you have very stylish cinematography, which is always a pleasure, and the 1937 sets, very well done visually. And of course the story, which is good, but which sadly works only at the intellectual level, not at the emotional level. So watching "Thirteenth" is definitely not an involving experience, but more like a quick reading of an SF novel's summary, with nice images. Many other movies about created or fake realities or identities are far superior in this matter (eXistenZ, Abre los ojos, Blade Runner, Jacob's Ladder, Matrix...).What a missed opportunity... 6/10</fullReview>

When it came out in '99, VHS sales were still somewhat substantial but this is one film in which DVD and an accompanying surround system makes a big, positive difference. I like the cast, too, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Moll, Vincent D'Onofrio and Armin Mueller-Stahl. They may not be big names but these are actors who are almost always fascinating in the roles they play. Now that I've seen D'Onofrio in "Law and Order: Criminal Intent" and enjoyed Bierko as Max Baer in "Cinderella Man," I'm inclined to give this another look. I traded this DVD for something else around 2001 and I wish I had it back.</fullReview>

The movie was surprisingly thought provoking and fascinating, perhaps more than "eXistenZ". I could tell that this film was not made on a big budget like "The Matrix", because the high tech action was missing. The cast is not first rate either, you may recognize some faces, Vincent D'Onofrio(Men In Black, The Cell), Gretchen Moll(Rounders), and Armin Mueller Stahl(The Game, X-Files).

		<fullReview>I wasn't familiar with this film, so I read up on it a little and was surprised to learn that it was a box office disaster due to its bad timing of being released the same year as "The Matrix." It's a real shame, because "The Thirteenth Floor" is quite good with an excellent cast, perhaps not of superstars, but of very solid actors: Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Vincent D'onofrio. The plot concerns a man (Bierko) using an invention to go back to 1937 Los Angeles to find out who murdered his boss (Mueller-Stahl) and why.I found this film fascinating, intriguing, and well-acted, and it had some neat twists. The 1937 time period was beautifully recreated; the entire film was very atmospheric with excellent cinematography.What a shame - perhaps "The Thirteenth Floor," like many other films, will find more of an audience as time goes on, so it can be separated from "The Matrix," to which it only has a very general association.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film-Noir thriller with a striking visual style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the third film released in 1999 based on the theme of virtual reality, "The Thirteenth Floor" was unfairly treated due to its bad timing of release. It seemed that after "The Matrix" and "eXistenZ", the moviegoing public got a little tired of leaving the dense confines of reality and exploring another dimension. It's a shame, because while "The Thirteenth Floor" does not offer much more insight, it offers a far different and equally interesting approach to the topic of real virtual reality. Craig Bierko and Vincent D'Onofrio star.Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is a scientist who, working with partner Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko), helped create a simulation of reality that takes place in Los Angeles of 1937. Fuller enters the game at the beginning of the film, leaves a note within the simulation for Douglas Hall, and then attempts to inform him in the real world. Unfortunately for him, he is taken out to the back of a bar and stabbed several times by an unidentified assailant. The film then cuts to Douglas Hall's apartment, where he checks for messages on his answering machine before leaving for work on the 13th floor of an office building. He works there with Whitney (Vincent D'Onofrio) developing the simulation further with the former help of Fuller. Hall has never tried the simulation himself and the recent events have persuaded him to try and figure out what happened. He pursues entering the game, where he is awaken to a world of the late 1930's, only this world seems all too real to him. He takes the identity of John Ferguson and tries to track Hannon Fuller's steps leading up to his murder. He runs into bartender Ashton (also D'Onofrio) who makes every attempt at misleading him. Hall cannot find a single clue and must continue entering the game until he is able to find Fuller's murder and the motive to do it. With the help of Whitney and Fuller's daughter (Gretchen Mol) Hall will do everything he can to track down a killer before he strikes again."The Thirteenth Floor", while not a very well-acted film, is still an engaging one. A film-noir atmosphere is secreted by a boundless storyline that offers a new twist at every turn. The film is very unpredictable, which is good, and is very well-plotted. Unfortunately, the film is far too talky and at the same time bores the audience. There are some instances of action at one time or another, but not to excess... or not enough. In summary, this film is a so-so thriller with an excellent metropolitan visual style that knows how to grip an audience, but the question is for how long. I give this film 2 1/2 stars on a five star scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty film that plays chicken with nihilism (SPOILER ALERT!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER WARNING! DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE* My cousin Jaimee dismissed The Thirteenth Floor by saying it was "like a TV movie." I must admit that despite its interesting premise, and its luscious, atmospheric and utterly convincing recreations of 1930's Los Angeles, there is something unidentifiably smallish and cheesy about this film. Maybe it's because the cartoonishly boyish Craig Bierko fails to convince as a leading man. I don't know. But whatever it was, I didn't let it bother me too much, because The Thirteenth Floor is good science fiction (as well as being pleasing to the eye, if I may risk repeating myself). Like any good science fiction story, it works on at least two levels: Exploring the implications of technological and social development in the future, and saying something about the nature of our lives in the here and now. In the latter regard, The Thirteenth Floor touches, broadly but poignantly, on the existentialist problem of the value of our lives after we come to view our thoughts and experiences as so many electrical impulses (be they in microchips or neural tissue). But the film inexplicably shies away from a head-on confrontation with nihilism, perhaps out of a simple desire to make an unambiguously happy ending. I didn't notice this the first time I saw the movie, but Gretchen Mol's character could easily be interpreted as the real "bad guy." Not that she's supposed to be; you're not supposed to notice her manipulativeness, her scheming. But I think the story could have been more interesting if this issue had been addressed honestly. And her husband's supposed to be this scary psycho-killer, but his only victims are computer animations, as far as we know. Couldn't his character have been used to illustrate the "banality of evil"--the ease with which seemingly average people can convince themselves that other thinking, feeling beings are less "real," and thus less deserving of life? Is he a murderer, or just a video-game creep? Is he himself murdered, or merely reprogrammed? If these questions, which arise naturally out of the provocative subject matter, had been articulated, they might have lent the grande finale a complexity that could have distinguished The Thirteenth Floor from a "TV movie" in anybody's eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must have had one of the worst, and most misleading, ad campaigns in the history of cinema, ever. The ads made me expect a generic b sci-fi/horror matrix clone. Instead, it was a well thought out, interesting, and solid sci-fi movie about the nature of AI. Good acting across the board, good cinematography, good script, good movie. It's not that it's a great movie or anything, but it is remarkable good. A better sci-fi movie than almost every sci-fi movie that's come out within the past five years. The only problem is that it doesn't seem like it would be fun watching this movie repeatedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Matrix concept repackaged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was better than I expected and didn't appear to be as low-budget as I expected. Of course, the concept immediately causes you to compare it to The Matrix, but I don't think that it's a "thinking man's Matrix" by any stretch of the imagination. The story is involved and intriguing, but no more so than The Matrix. I personally think that The Matrix's story line is more gripping and more creative.The big difference between The Thirteenth Floor and The Matrix is Lawrence Fishburne and the packaging. The Matrix didn't win four Oscars just because it was glitzy. By comparison, The Thirteenth Floor had special effects where necessary (which is not as frequent as The Matrix) and Craig Bierko (who typically plays villains in low-budget movies).Actually, in retrospect, I think that I liked The Thirteenth Floor more because of The Matrix - it packaged a similar idea in a different way, and you know that they didn't just rip it off because they came out at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simpler "eXistenZ"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bumped into this title at the video library, while checking out "eXistenZ", since I like David Cronenberg's works, and the clerk told me that "The 13th Floor" is the same only better. I took the two of them and I must say that although "eXistenZ" has a lot of the Cronenberg-ish "charm", I found it to be very weak, ineffective, and pretty pointless...On the contrary, "The 13th Floor", although I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's not really into sci-fi, is a great movie that showcases the same (main) ideas presented in "eXistenZ", with a better plot and a much more effective direction.Bottom line - very good entertainment and a thought-provoking sci-fi thriller indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Matrix without all the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. It had me second guessing right up till the end. It's a combination of The Matrix and Time Cop, but with much better acting and writing. I especially enjoyed the idea of a world with distance limitations. The Truman Show and Dark City used this idea as well, but here, it is taken to the nth degree. I mean, a virtual world inside a vitual world!! Wow! The murder mystery plot was great. This movie also makes you think about how far Man will go with virtual reality. All in all, a great whodunnit sci-fi thriller. 8/10PS: I wonder if Douglas Hall was named after Douglas Fairbanks. Steve Bierko looks so like him in his thirties look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has just one, big fault. It has come after Matrix. It has some really good, imaginative points, but if you have already seen the flick mentioned above, you'll probably be able to forecast the plot after only a few minutes. The thirteenth floor is worth seeing anyway, as the acting is pretty good and the plot still have a couple of nice twists. Most important, the non-sequiturs and logical incoherences typically found in such movies are kept to a minimum. If you appreciated sci-fi movies like Strange Days, Existenz and, again, Matrix, you'll surely like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous production design and brilliant plot twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the things that most endears me to this movie is that it deals with a very techie subject -- virtual reality -- without coming across as a techie film. Combined with a brilliant plot twist, this is a movie that will leave most with a desire to view it a second time.It's also got to have the biggest effects budget of any movie that doesn't involve space, creatures, explosions, or some kind of massive disaster. The effects are blended in so smoothly that even the most astute fans of movie magic don't instantly think "wow, what great effects." This is in large part due to the meticulous detail coming from the production designers, who put just as much effort and detail into their sets and costumes (and extras).On the down side though, the movie does suffer a bit from somewhat bland acting; the three leads (Bierko, Stahl and Mol -- sounds like a vaudeville troupe) are so subdued that it's easy to lose interest in their part of the plot. The two most interesting characters are brought out in large part because of the actors themselves: D'Onofrio and Haysbert, who in every movie seem to become the focus of every scene they're in.Still, this movie is serious proof that content is king with a plot that well overcomes the bland acting. At points the storyline is shuffled into the background for a moment, and the bland characters take over with simiarly tasteless dialogue. However, the visual design of the film keeps your eyes glued to the imagery.For me, a 7 out of 10.On a final note, the DVD version of this film is worth checking out, as it provides a lot of information and visuals (including interactive before/after sequences) with regards to the production design.</fullReview>

It just all seemed wrong. Forced, too obvious. They had been cultivating a mood rather successfully for the previous hour and POOF - gone in a bunch of silly virtual cliches.SPOILER AHEAD:The biggest problem for me: The if-you-die-in-the-simulation-the-simulated-person-takes-over-for-you twist. If I programmed the simulation I'd have squashed that bug before letting people use it. And why would that same rule apply to the simulation-within-a-simulation.I'm glad it's not true with Nintendo, because if while playing Mario, he fell into a lava pit. I would be Mario and not myself. hmmm. Makes you think. not really. two stars (four star beginning no-star ending)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old story made up as a B picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot and the idea of this movie are not exactly original. There are a million SF books out there dealing with it. Some as old as from the seventies, when cyberspace or virtual reality were completely beyond the comprehension of even SF freaks. What I did not like is the definite ending. Why not show a slight flicker of energy in the eyes of the hero just before the ending of the movie, suggesting that this is not the final world? To obvious? The last time I got annoyed by an ending like this was Total Recall, when the movie ended with the indication that Arnie's trip to Mars was real, and not due to a virtual reality trip in the computer of the travel agent. You could argue that this is more subtle than a clear hint, but I can tell you from night long discussions with friends that most people miss this subtleness and hold on to the calming feeling of something real in the end. Movies like this should question that feeling.</fullReview>

The movie, basically, did not offer any surprisses whatsoever. The only time i was a little bit surprised was when the course of actions in the movie makes you realize (but you still not sure) that there is a simulation within the simulation. It would be unjust from me to say it was a very bad movie...but i think the timing, the release of this movie wasn`t right. The story was already out (Matrix and D.City) and i think that`s why for many people, this movie wasn`t so interesting anymore. As from my point of view...it was OK to watch it once....but it didn`t impress me so much to go out and buy the movie. I would give it a 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here again the IMDB has divided reviewers, most liking 13th Floor, and a few not, and it's likely because of where the viewer is coming from. Same theme as Matrix and eXistenZ, an alternate virtual world, but 13th Floor is the adult version, with adult relationships, adult effects, and an adult story. Matrix is the action version, with lots of flashy FX, and basic one dimension relationships. eXistenZ is the pure teen version, with amateur acting and simple relationships, and silly FX. 13th Floor is a match for Dark City except for the FX. Definitely worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film on its own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film noir. The possibity of a simulation presented here is far more attainable than those in Dark City or The Matrix. If you know about games like Sim City or Civilization, imagine those games taken several steps further. The twist what the present day world we see in the film actually is was really neat although I had learned of this twist in advance thanks to newspaper spoilers.This is a good film in its own right. Its timing was the only thing going against it. Although similar in theme, they are also different in certain respects. Dark City is strictly about challenging those who wish to control you, The Matrix presents a double-sided coin as getting rid of the enemy is not as simple as black &amp; white, The 13th Floor pushes the idea from the creator's POV. We've always want to create something, make stories and this movie takes that step further. As for actors' performances, I didn't find them too stiff, although Craig Berko sometimes sounds like Jeff Goldblum, he even has that sleepy look. The script could use some polishing though. The impact of certain events leaves me wanting. The realization that a simulation is in the "real world" is left to be desired. Still, as I've said before, on its own it's pretty good, but just compare this with the previous movies this falls behind.The verdict: 3.5 of 5 star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has 'thinking' gone out of fashion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it just me or are people missing the point? This movie is not a Matrix clone. Matrix is science fantasy. Thirteenth Floor looks at something that is theoretically possible in the future. This is a very deep movie. Its only down side is that it is a very difficult movie to make and comprehend. Just try to think about it for a second.Computer simulations have been around for a while now. You can simulate wars to work out strategies, you can simulate aircraft for flight training, you can simulate explosions to work out the resulting damage. The list is endless. You have played video games at some point in time have'nt you? Well when you think about it most games are basically simulations, be it flight simulator, FIFA 99, quake, doom, red alert etc.As computing power increases, the quality, realism and accuracy of simulations is improving all the time. At the moment, characters in a game fake 'intelligence'. Say you fire a gun in a game like quake, an enemy 'hears' you turns around and shoots back. A character in a game falls on the ground and holds his arm where he has just been shot. But he is not programmed to feel pain, or to bleed or to fear his own death. But what if he was?Now say we approach such a level of programming, that characters in a computer simulation are programmed with real intelligence and awareness, their world is fully programmed to appear, feel, smell and touch as real to them, as our world does to us. Say we want to see the reaction of the people of a city to a nuclear leak at a power plant. We create a city with a power plant on the outskirts, populate (program) this simulated city with simulated people and objects from the sub-nuclear level right up to frozen pizza. These simulated people move and think independently within this environment. They sleep, eat, have sex, go to school, steal and watch television. They breathe what to them is air, they 'think'. They worry about bills, jobs, security, money, the weather, traffic jams...'. Then we program the nuclear leak, sit back and watch as these poor characters run for their lives!Now are there any ethics to creating such a simulation? Are we responsible for their continued existence? Are they 'real'? "I think therefore, I am". Well if they did 'think' then are they? What if Microsoft or Electronic Arts brought out 'Virtual World 2050' for Windows? You slot in your CD, enter setup and create a world on your system full of 'intelligent' characters in their own world. Perhaps a better name for this game would be "GOD 2050" for Windows, because as far as these characters are concerned, that is what you would be.How about input/output methods? Keyboards, mouse and pen pointers, voice recognition, monitors and VR sets? Our brain waves, senses and optic images are made up of impulses. Isnt it theoretically possible to link up to a computer so that what we feel, sense and see is computer generated? Say this interface disengages your senses and links you to one of the characters in a simulation so that you now feel, sense and see what this character does in his virtual reality world.The problem with this movie is that when you really think about it, this subject is difficult to comprehend because unlike timetravel (impossible), space travel (nothing can travel faster than the speed of light so forget about the warp drive and space exploration) and alien invasions (is there really anyone out there?) it will happen and may create more of an uproar than genetic engineering. You can either make something spectacularly outlandish (like Matrix) or realistic? You cannot do both.Another problem with this concept is that it is virtually impossible for a virtual character to figure out for himself that he is simulated. The bits where these characters drive to the end of their simulations are pretty stupid. But how can a simulated character find out that he is a simulation in a simulated world? If you program a world well enough, your characters will never know. You could throw earthquakes, hailstorms, a solar eclipse everyday, even keyboards raining from the sky and these poor characters would just watch scared, helpless and totally confused.And one day you find that you are running out of hard disk space and you decide to delete the virtual world on your system? Would you or would'nt you? What if your own world was simulated? What if you were a simulated character? How would you react to finding out that you were just a simulated character? How would you react to finding out that your existence was totally at the mercy of a programmer who is just a mortal? Would life loose its meaning?I was intensely dissappointed with 'The Matrix', mainly because I was expecting this very issue that has been taken up by 'The Thirteenth Floor'. For me 'The Matrix' was a spectacular special effects show with stylised slow motion shots, and cool techno music. As far as substance was concerned 'The Matrix' was pure nonsense. It had no hole in the story as the story itself was a hole. If this world is simulated and the real one has us all kept alive in incubators by some evil life form then stuff reality, I'll stay right here thank you. Also if this world is a simulation then the programmers have complete control. No need to send in 'Men in Black' lookalikes (and why not send in three hundred instead of 3), no use running around looking for telephones. The programmer just has to run Norton antivirus. Similar mistakes are made in Thirteenth floor, but only become apparent when you think about them. For instance if you are a simulation and you find out the truth, so what? You can never pose any threat to your programmers? No need to download and kill the simulated character.The atmosphere of the movie is right as it deals with a serious issue like self awareness. The acting is suited to the movie, sober. The romance could have been toned down or left out but the supermarket checkout scene is beautifully done and is very touching (only if you think about whats happening and realise what Douglas Hall is realising) and the ending could have been much much better. What if the movie ended with the simulated worlds being switched off? No more school from tomorrow. This is a movie, not a special effects extravaganza with hyperactive gun toting heroes saying 'lets kick some ass'.I figured out exactly where the story was leading as soon as Fuller came out of the 1930's simulation into the 'real' world. It does not take much genius to work it out. It is really difficult to fool people nowadays or keep people in suspense. In 'Saving Private Ryan' everyone knew that the first Ryan was the wrong one, in 'Seven' everyone knew what was being delivered in the FedEx van. But I wanted to see how things unfold.If you like to use your brain now and then, you will love this movie, as I did. Also if you tend not to be influenced by hype and publicity, you may appreciate this movie. I think that this movie could easily have been a classic. I am a science fiction fan and I was intruiged. I read Stanley Kubrik, Arthur C. Clark and other sci-fi novelists. My favourite sci-fi movies are Blade Runner, Contact, 2001. Non sci-fi favourites are The Shawshank Redemption, ANTZ, Some like it hot. For me 'The Matrix' and 'Phantom Menace' were incredibly overated. A movie is not just about special effects and a bunch of hip overconfident cocky characters wearing Raybans in the dark.I was definetely a minority when I loved 'The Shawshank Redemption' and everyone was calling it crap, and the same looks true here too. I'll give 'The Thirteenth Floor' 8/10.</fullReview>

Yes, this movie works so brain, so if you don't have one, stay home and watch Friends, or Dilbert. If you are intelligent, go see it, it's good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 13th floor was quite thought provoking, and had good acting and plot, but it wasn't flashy enough to be really exciting and totally enthralling. The science fiction aspect of the movie was there as a gimmick that the actors worked around, but at heart it was a mystery/suspense movie that happened to have a few boxes with blinking lights thrown in.However, now that I've discarded ALL my complaints about the movie, I'll get on to the aspects that were outstanding. Firstly, the actors each had at least 2 characters to portray, and they did this in a very believable manner. Combine that with good dialog and there was enough to keep me interested. The plot also had a few good twists, which kept the action going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't really complain since i saw this for free. Anyway, not a bad start for its director, and a lot of credit should be given to the effects crew for the 30's scene's. A good mix of mystery and Sci-fi. . But other than that a little predictable, and not the most original story. The timing is it's worst enemy, and I'm sorry to say but its a simpler version of "The Matrix".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: I may spoil this so don't be mad. I thought the movie was written quite well. The plot had many twists, and kept u in suspense. It was pretty fast-paced for most of the movie, although at the middle, it slowed down a little. Of course by the end, it was a little more fast paced than the middle. I would like to comment on the set and costume design, how they were very accurate. But it was unfortunate because the setting was in the present for most of the film. The ending was good, but if u pay attention to the movie, it's kind of predictable. All in all, it was well made and written. Quite entertaining on my part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm reluctant to use "The Matrix" as a basis for comparison here, since the movies are so different, but the premises are so similar that I can't get around it. Both are about simulated worlds and people getting caught up in them. That is the ONLY similarity. While "The Matrix" is a slam-bang, special effects action-packed slugfest, "The Thirteenth Floor" is a much quieter, more thoughtful movie. A mystery, even. Unfortunately, anyone who HAS seen "The Matrix" can piece together the puzzle much faster than the movie should allow. Still, it's a good film and fun to watch, but it isn't a movie to go to if you want to just sit down and not think for awhile. This movie demands the audience to work a bit and, while I personally don't think that happens nearly enough these days, such a film rarely makes for a blockbuster.</fullReview>

The story is similar in some respects to the Matrix, only much better thought out. But whereas the Matrix was all style and little substance, this movie has solid acting and story to back it up. Also has a really good reveal, although the trailer gives it away somewhat.Blade Runner it's not, but if you liked Strange Days, Videodrome and Total Recall, you'll probably enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannon Fuller (played by Armin Mueller-Stahl) is a computer wizard who has just invented a virtual reality machine that allows the user to transport to another venue (in this case Los Angeles of 1937) and interact with realistic human simulations. Unfortunately, while in the process of doing so he discovers a very deep and powerful secret. One that gets him killed. Meanwhile, one of his associates, by the name of "Douglas Hall" (played by Craig Bierko), starts experiencing problems of his own even though he hasn't attempted to use the device yet. Not only that, he suddenly finds himself as the prime suspect in the murder of his good friend, Hannon Fuller. He then is further surprised to meet "Jane Fuller" (played by Gretchen Mol) who happens to be the unknown daughter of Hannon. After all of this, things become even more intriguing as Jane Fuller, like Hannon Fuller before her, seeks to turn the device off. Having said that, I'll leave the rest of the story to any viewers who might want to see this film for themselves. Personally, I thought this was a decent film even though it didn't have a great deal of action or a star-studded group of actors. Craig Bierko was likable despite the fact that his performance was rather average. Likewise, Gretchen Mol was good-looking and played her part adequately as well. In short, this isn't a great film. But it is a good, solid science-fiction/thriller that most fans of this genre should enjoy. The fact that it was nominated for a Saturn Award for the "Best Science Fiction Film" of 2000 should support this view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this movie is not too important or famous, I will keep this comment short. The Thirteenth Floor is one of those movies that are not one of a kind. If you try to find something that you saw only here and nowhere else, probably you will never find anything. But still this movie has something, that makes you feel warm. The little chitchats between Douglas Hall and Jane Fuller made me feel warm. This movie is not about warmth of words, of course. But that undertone becomes a big deal as the movie approaches its end. Fairly before the ending, the movie lets you know what's going to happen in the end, but it feels very sweet when it happens finally. If you don't see The Thirteenth Floor, you won't miss anything too great. But if you do see it, you will like it most probably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm getting really tired of saying this about movies, but this yet another movie that had an interesting idea, but poorly executed. That preceding sentence may as well be my username. In this case, it wasn't the overall thread of the story that was the problem, but individual scenes that were so unrealistically written/directed that I unfortunately have no choice but to assume that the movie makers were either 1) on drugs, or 2) just got off drugs.There's never been a movie where I look at the story and say, "ok, that's just not believable, this story is just too over the top to take seriously." I never say that. I'll respect any story someone wants to tell me as long as the movie follows some sort of internal logic, and has its characters reacting and interacting with their world in a manner that approaches some semblance of realism. This movie lacked exactly that, here are some examples: **When Ashton first finds out from Hall that his world is not real, he becomes *extremely* hostile and is ready to kill Hall. Why are you in such a hurry to off the ONE GUY that can give you more insight into this unbelievable revelation? You'll of course feel angry, but wouldn't you want to get more information on this first before you murder him, if you still plan on going that route?**One of the characters explained to Hall that when he was driving down the highway and eventually stopped, he was completely terrified by what he saw ahead of him (referring to the digital holographic structure that Hall would eventually see). Umm, a sane person would ask the next obvious question: "WHAT DID YOU SEE?" Why would you not ask that obvious followup question? Don't you want to know what he was so terrified by? Instead Hall keeps that same stupid worried look on his face.**When Hall is talking with the girl in the grocery store, the girl eventually asks, "you're not from around here, are you?", and tells Hall that he looks familiar. What the hell. If he looks familiar, then why is she assuming that he wouldn't be from around here? What kind of person even talks like that? Who was the script supervisor? Did they even have one, or was he one of the people on drugs? **When one of the characters gets pulled over by a cop, the cop asks for his driver's license. The character tells him he forgot it at home. The cop then says, "check your glove box." When was the last time you got pulled over, tell the cop you don't have your registration, and have the cop suggest you check your glove box? Give me a break, that was just an amateurish attempt at building suspense since we find out a second later that there's a gun in the glove box.Yeah, thinking about this movie makes me angry.</fullReview>

Vincent d'onofrio is excellent. he gets pretty typecast in films. he plays 2 characters - a barman and a computer programmer. and he gets hijacked by a user. and ends up dead.over all it's a lot like the matrix and many other films that question the reality in which we live.i like it.the lead actor is rubbish.

		<fullReview>Probably the most interesting fact concerning this film is its strange similarity to "The Matrix" and that "The Thirteenth Floor" and "The Matrix" were both released in the year 1999. Both films deal with identical themes (see "Simulacra and Simulation"), but approach them very differently - which is why I think "The Matrix" and "The Thirteenth Floor" actually compliment eachother and ought both to be given equal attention. Alas, "The Thirteenth Floor" does suffer from poor acting on the part of two of its characters, (personally, I think "The Matrix" does too, but Reeves himself compensates for his peers' shortcomings) and the writing is flawed and too often amateur. Still, having said this, "The Thirteenth Floor" is in some ways a better and more enjoyable movie than "The Matrix" and is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 13th Floor had such potential... An excellent plot that takes thebasic elements of the Matrix and expands them into a wonderful -if a little hokey - sci-fi/thriller. But what happened?Instead of being a top-notch movie that could rival most sci-fimovies for dominance, it ended up being a drawn-out, poorlyexecuted movie that looked like nothing more than a ripoff.First of all, the acting was shabby. Craig Bierko must now rank upwith Keanu Reeves as one of the worst, most stony-faced actorsof all time. Every scene that he was in immediately lost itspotential for drama and was turned into a farce by his so-bad-it- must-be-self-parody job.And this is the main problem. The special effects are good, thescreenwriting is good, the plot is excellent. But the acting is sowooden, it gives the whole movie a feel of being drawn out andoverlong.Although, not all of this can be blamed on the acting. Some partsof the movie - especially toward the end - are much too long andoverplayed. This is unfortunate. Because long and dramatictalking scenes are excellent for certain if not most kinds of movies.Many movies could benefit from this. But the Thirteenth Floor is notone of these movies. All in all, the potential of this movie is incredible. Much of the movieis vert well-staged, especially the 1930s-era scenes. Butunfortunately, the good feeling wears off quickly and instead, 13thFloor leaves unfulfilled promise, instead of Matrix-esque awe.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As many people may know, 'The Thirteenth Floor' was not received well by critics, in fact, it was only released on video over here in the UK, it sadly never was given a chance at the cinema. I think much of the problem with people perception of this film stems from a series of inescapable facts; there are no big names in this film, the budget was modest, there are no real 'action' sequences to speak and the director has not really been heard of in America. But these are not things that you should base the worth of a film on, yet many people do. The top and bottom of it is that 'The Thirteenth Floor' is a gripping sci-fi/noir thriller which keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting is first rate, with Craig Bierko putting in the most notable performance as Douglas Hall as well as Gretchen Mol playing the love interest, Jane Fuller, yet it is Mol's performance as the checkout girl persona which deserves most credit. In addition, the concepts of worlds inside worlds is dealt with far greater maturity than the 'The Matrix' was. You also can't say that this film stole any ideas as the novel that is was based on was written over 20 years ago. I was rivetted to this film and anyone with the patience to let the film drag you in will be too. The whole plot revolves around a simulation of the 1930s in which Douglas Hall and his now-dead boss, Hannon Fuller, interfaced with. When entering the simulation they replace virtual beings that are scentient and the consciousness of these beings is temporarily stored in the brain of the user. However, Fuller is killed and Hall soon becomes the prime suspect and he soon begins to believe that he could possibly be the killer. The film follows Hall on his investigation in to what happened whilst he finds himself becoming attracted to Fuller's daughter, Jane who Hall didn't even know existed. All the while Hall is being pursued by Detective McBain who is played to perfection. The sets in the 30s are fantastic, the acting is top-notch and the plot is involving. Some people may find the twist easy to predict and, okay, I predicted it too but it doesn't detract for the overall sense of struggle to define ourselves and the integrity of somebody whether real or created. I loved every second of this film. I won't tell you what happens in the end but that too was brilliant, even though I personally believe the original ending would have had more impact. So, what are you waiting for? Go BUY this film, or at the very least rent it! 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the main reason why most people didn't like "The Thirteenth Floor" was because it lacked the frenetic action sequences found in "The Matrix" (which was also an excellent film). In truth though, the plot for "The Thirteenth Floor" is stronger, much more thought-provoking, and more suspenseful...not something you'd expect from Roland Emmerich, one half of the duo that did such mindless Hollywood fare as "Godzilla" or "Independence Day". I guess we know where all the talent was in that partnership...I really enjoyed the plot twists and the way in which you had to figure out what was real and what wasn't. All of the actors were excellent, especially Craig Bierko and Vincent D'Onofrio. I was also impressed with the look and feel of the 1940s sequences...very film noirish.This film may not be pretentious artsy-fartsy flick like David Cronenberg's "eXistenZ" nor an action-packed blockbuster like "The Matrix", but it's still an intelligent, well-written film for anyone into sci-fi. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The recent spate of virtual-reality movies has progressed to the point where the so-called reality has to be even more and more real. The story here concerns a company that has somehow been able to recreate 1937 Los Angeles; its makers download themselves into the system, taking on the persona of someone already in there. The problem? Someone there has figured out they're not real - or are they?One of the biggest problems that the mass populace has with science fiction movies is that the science itself can be confusing and off-putting. Not the case with this film. While the special effects are indeed special, the plot will have enough curves to keep you guessing, but not enough to numb your brain. At its heart, it's a murder mystery, and there's no knowledge of sci-fi needed to figure it out. But the ending IS unexpected. You also get some very solid performances by a willing cast, including the great Armin Mueller-Stahl.Bottom line: Sci-fi fans will appreciate this film and won't think it's beneath them, or too mainstream, while the rest of us will like the special effects and the plot twists. If you saw "Dark City," you'll get an idea of how good or bad this film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is reality?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you turn on your T.V. and the picture inexplicably comes through that screen, do we ever question how that happens? When we write these reviews on the Internet, do we ever wonder how they get from here ( my home ) to there ( cyberspace )? When you can send a fax to someone, do we ever wonder how that is possible? The answer to these questions is No! We never do. We never question what is reality and what may be someone's imagination. I was once told by my favourite English teacher ( Mr. Krisak ) that some people have the theory that we are all a part someone's elaborate dream. That is why we can do some of the things we can. The 13th floor may just be that person having that dream. It certainly subscribes to that theory.The film tells the story of a company that has finally figured out how to travel to another time through what can be described as virtual reality. They jack into a computer and it brings them to the thirties. But this world is not quite perfect yet. It is like the first draft of a screenplay. The tools are there but small things need to be tightened up. That is why the smoke only seems to be on one side of the room and the coloring is a little off and people may only be two dimensional. It needs some work. But then suddenly, in the real world, the creator of the program is killed mysteriously by someone that he knows. The rest of the film is for us to figure out who done it. And trying to figure that out is one of the intrigues of the movie.On a technical level, this film is terrific. As a matter a fact, this film is really quite good in almost every way. The only problem that I have with it ( as well ) is that it was marketed poorly. And of course it came out right after The Matrix. Both films may be about what really is reality, but both films are excellent in their own right. And remember, they did come out after Dark City. All three ask the same questions. But only the Matrix has a ton of action and at least somewhat of a bonafide star.The 13th floor will make you think and that is its strength. I walked out of the theater a little paranoid. Am I real? Are you real? See this film and judge for yourself. I'll tell you something though, using a cell phone makes more sense to me now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had very low expectations going into this movie, just as I did with The Matrix. I don't usually find high tech movies very interesting, but this one had me hook line and sinker. The only problem with it and the reason why it will fail at the box office is because it was marketed improperly.We live in a world that has cell phones, the Internet, beepers, cameras, digital this and digital that. What all that means is that our life has gotten a whole easier than what it used to be in say the 50's. But take a close look at what we have in our world and you may begin to question how certain things really work. Not in theory, we all know how theoretically things make sense, no I'm talking about how they realistically work. If you take a camera and really think about it, it should not work. You are synthetically capturing a moment in time on a piece of paper and that is seemingly impossible. It doesn't sound impossible but that's because we are so used to it. We never question everything and that is what this movie does. It shows us another possible world and it shows us how synthetic and possibly unreal everything that we have before us really is.The 13th Floor is a story about how people jack into another world that has been created on someone's computer. Things go strange when the genius behind it is murdered. Who did it? And why? Those are he central issues at hand in this movie but what it does is it makes you question reality. It makes you question who we are and what this world is all about. If you haven't seen this movie because of the commercials, that is understandable. But take my word for it. This movie is worth seeing. Then maybe you will have the same questions as the rest of us.Maybe you'll walk out of The 13th Floor wondering who you really are.Who are we? This movie seems to know. And maybe you won't like what it has to say.</fullReview>

Although The Thirteenth Floor is not the same as the Matrix it does have similarities and maybe that is why it isn't that popular.But as a movie, and a concept it is well made and is worth watching, this film does explore the concept better than the Matrix does, it just lacks the Visual scale and A-List Cast, and is therefore given no recognition.Don't think that this a Matrix Clone, it is not, i stress again, it simply has basic plot lines that run in parallel to the Matrix.8/10, but the Matrix is still Better.</fullReview>

That's not fun, especially when the concept (What if life is just a computer simulation?) is unoriginal, the characters aren't interesting, the pacing is slow, and the dialogue is unrealistic.Another reviewer referred to the lead as a "Brendan Fraser clone." That's amazingly accurate, appearance-wise. But maybe if the always likable Fraser were in it, there would be *some* reason to watch this suspenseless rehash of a concept we've seen again and again.

		<shortDescription>Depressingly bad treatment of an engaging premise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In that this is based on a previously published book, I'll assume the book is of pretty high quality, having not read it myself. I must say, if this is the case, this is one of the worst adaptations of a book for the screen I've ever seen. I felt the need to walk out on several occasions, staying only due to the fact that the basic plot was clearly interesting if the actual movie was ignored.The dialogue is bad, very bad, usually painfully so. Further, it foreshadows with a sledgehammer, which is made even worse in that Lucas makes an equally paltry attempt, and fails with similar results.This is not to say, necessarily, that this movie should not be seen. The conclusion did hold my interest, confirming my feeling that somewhere beneath the movie was an interesting story. Further, Gretchen Mol is enrapturing, and I was overjoyed to see Cerrano on the big screen again.Nonetheless, this is not good. I haven't been this disappointed since Sphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, no computer programme can create REAL people. You need a nervous system to feel anything. In a virtual world, there are no nervous systems. Characters in a controlled universe may act like they feel or know, because that's how they may be programmed. But they will never actually feel or know anything. That's the obvious reason this movie is a pile of self-important but impossible-to-even-consider-taking-seriously crap. Add to that the mind boggling extreme silliness about a character from the virtual world taking the place of someone in the real world, and you really must question: How the hell did this Matrix craze catch on outside of mental hospitals? 3 out of ten just for the murder mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh look, a Matrix-wannabe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reality is created by a machine.How many movies are going to use that hackneyed plot idea? Obviously the writers here thought that they could jump on the bandwagon that "The Matrix" made popular in hopes to earn a little extra cash.Firstly, this movie was certainly NOT intellectually stimulating. It didn't make me question what this reality truly is made of, and it didn't have me mentally link the storyline to a philosophy-type book I had recently read (side note: If you ever read Daniel Quinn's book "Ishmael," I guarantee that you can see some similarities of ideas. By the way, the book came first.) "The Thirteenth Floor" really disappointed me mentally, because I was hoping for at least a little mind-bending to occur. But nooooo...the advertisements had to fool me. ;-)A big factor in movies is the music, right? In the case with "The Thirteenth Floor," the music was (in some places) grand and celebratory, all right, but the scenery it was meant to match was...well, drab, mediocre, and rather plain. If the purpose of the music is to obviously try to make the movie seem more epic or more emotional with no effect, you've got a problem.But hey, if you're like me and actually enjoy renting bad movies in order to laugh at their mediocrity and to better appreciate the actually good ones, this movie gets my strong recommendation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor movie at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing wrong with not having a lot of special effect in a movie, however, when you have no plot either that is a problem. The 13th floor is extremely boring in every aspect. The acting is terrible and the script isn't much better.The plot is interesting in principle, but is so poorly played that is completely falls apart. The story moves extremely slowly and yet is hardly developed at all.The best line in the whole movie ("What did you do to the world?" "I turned it off.") turns out to be completely stupid in context and no other lines are even slightly interesting.In summary, this is a poor excuse for a movie with poor acting and is excruiatingly slow. I give it a 3/10, and I would give it a 1/10 if it weren't for the interesting concept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story on this movie is amazing, but the only reason I say it was OK, it's because for some reason while I was watching the movie, I felt like I was watching a crappy movie. I'm not sure if it was because of the actors, the production, the mood or what, But I feel this movie could have been illustrated better, specially when it has such an amazing story.When you compare this movie to the matrix, you can see how different they, regardless of how similar the story is and the action effects. The matrix has a more serious and mysterious mood, which makes the movie more interesting, but the thirteen floor, they come and say what's going as if their research project was something very feasible, and not so amazing. They way the story was unraveled was weak, that's my point.</fullReview>

I think I liked Dennis Haysboro's character best because he was just sort of in the middle of the whole thing and stayed cool.The script is so well written with every character fitting their role in a simulated scenario they're in.

		<fullReview>The film exception wants to be when it grows up. Not reliant on cgi or blunderingly obvious plot pointers, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Inception, I just thought it could have been a lot better, particularly if it was taken a little deeper / further into the "What is reality" theme and wasn't dumbed down in places, explaining plot lines and pointers that are obvious anyway and are more enjoyable when subtly revealed. Way better than the 6.8 it currently warrants here. Try watching inception or the ilk, then this - you wont be disappointed, even if the ending becomes obvious and is slightly schmaltzy, and the romance could do with building an fleshing out, it is a 90's film and had to try to appeal to that audience, who,judging by its ratings missed the point anyway - due for a 2012 remake perhaps?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people will compare this to The Matrix, just because it was released two months later, and because of a similar theme. But, sadly for mainstream public, this movie has a bit more complex story to understand, there is no kung-fu action and there are no cool superheroes destined to save mankind from evil. The Matrix is not bad to have some fun and watch some nicely packed sci-fi action, but if you watched Total Recall, Ghost In The Shell, or any other material The Matrix has recycled, you would see that it really has nothing else to offer. Aside the fact The Thirteenth floor was released after The Matrix, it really has nothing similar to it in terms of story depth. It's well-directed, nicely shot and cut, the cast is not so well-known (which is a plus) and it does its job really good, make-up and photography are great, and sfx are well made and not overused. It's not so personal as Solyaris (not surprising - Tarkowsky is untouchable) and the love story gets a bit cheesy at one point, but besides that this movie has a lot to offer and if you give it some attention it will leave a satisfying afterglow. Unlike The Matrix... XD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had forgotten why I had this DVD in my rental queue, and expected to see another plot with a hidden floor in an office building or condo. It was interesting to find that it was a new view on levels of reality.I thought the acting was very good, the early time period custom cars and hotel night club were interesting to me, the story kept you guessing until the end, and did not depend completely on computer graphics or freakish aliens.I didn't think it was perfect, because of some confusion generated at some points. My areas of disappointment were the "cheats" such as the computer bringing a character back to its original reality level just as some dramatic event was taking place leaving another version of that person in place, and the end where one simulated character ends up in the "orginal" reality level.The movie does not have the "Hollywood", big budget feel of the "Matrix" series or "Collateral Damage", but is an excellent example of more classical sci-fi that I am glad to see instead of just more demonic alien creatures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clean And Simple Metaphysics Based Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you decide to make a movie which is based on a topic in the area of Metaphysics or Philosophy, you are indeed taking a big risk. First of all, you are cutting off the masses. The masses do not take interest in movies that are heavy on the brain in the sense that you have to think about the movie during it and even after it. So, yes, if you are making a movie on an unconventional topic, you are not targeting the masses. But then, that is the only first risk you are taking. The second part of the risk lies in the fact that the people who are going to see your movie will then belong to a category of people who are already initiated into these concepts. They are obviously going to see the movie with an active mind and the intention to dissect the movie.And hence the pressure is on the director and the script writers. The pressure is on to create a decent story line and a screen play that can appeal to this narrow section of movie goers. Also, there is a pressure on the actors to do their bit. The Thirteenth Floor explores the question, "What is real?" It is inspired by a novel called "Simulacron 3". Of course, I have not been able to get my hands on the novel and see how much it was inspired. But I guess that works in my favor in the sense that I can judge the movie without any prejudice.My way of looking at the ratings of movies is this. I give a ten when I believe that there cannot be another way of doing it that can substantially or remarkably make the movie better. And hence I give this movie a ten rating. I think this movie is different from its counterparts "The Matrix" and "The Dark City" in that it is remarkably simple to follow. It is always easy to explain something that is indeed easy and difficult things are anyway difficult to explain. But this movie takes a simple approach. The dialogs are straight and simple - no complex words and jargon, clean and crisp. This ensures that you remain hooked and interested. And the concept unfolds out pretty straight.And the screenplay moves very smoothly. And it leaves you in the end with the question, "What is Real?" You do not have to switch back and forth and search for hidden meaning within words. It is the simplicity of the movie that amazes me. Some people might criticize the movie for being too simple. But I believe it is the simplicity of the movie that defines it.If you are searching for a movie that is going to make you think, going to make you wonder and spend some time pondering over some questions, then this is indeed a movie you can put in your private collection. If you are among those who are looking for a way of escaping your daily grind and need something to cheer you up, you may not find this movie right for you.Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not expect much from this flick, but I must say it was one of the better films I have seen in a long while.There wasn't a boring moment in the film, it was enjoyable throughout. Of course there were some plot holes and technical details that made me laugh a bit. For instance, the "computer voice" had a kind of 1970's feel to it. Also, I doubt green lasers can do much to your mind. :) Probably one of the biggest plot holes involved the size of the "world". In 1937 people probably didn't travel too much, but would L.A. people of 1999 really live happily without any interaction with the outside world (the world outside the city)? Unless, of course, they were "brainwashed" by the programmer to live normally within the constraints of the world boundaries. But that kind of L.A. would probably look a lot different than the real L.A. of the 1999. The city would have to be self-sufficient, i.e. everything is manufactured within the city, unless stuff just "mysteriously" appears out of nowhere, which of course would in turn totally affect the mindset of these "virtual people".Anyway, I also liked The Matrix, which in some respects are quite similar to this movie, but in others, not. Difficult to say which one was "better", both were good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thirteenth Floor by Josef Rusnak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is about a computer-simulation-game with which you can sort of go back in time, switch into a character and be / act in it as long as your timer runs (usually 120 minutes). One of those films where reality and game melt to an undefined stream of time and non-time, like The Matrix. And like in Sophie's World the characters start at a certain point to guess that they are nothing but characters in a book, the protagonists in Rusnak's film start to guess that they are nothing but parts of a computer game, and try to struggle out of their fate - by even murdering their users.Although it's one of he really good films and extremely plausibly acted, I have the feeling it's a typical US-film. For with the cine-mania and the urge that everything, even news have to be presented in a good show, one might start to wonder if there is a bit of reality left, and how you can crumble it out from the show-mixture you are served with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * This is a very under-rated movie, and I wonder why. Four years after the release, here we have a very techno oriented sci-fi movie that did not lose anything of its appeal. The reason is that the focus is not in the details and effects, but in the intelligent story and the way the characters behave and interact. The story of a virtual reality game in a virtual reality game is original and has logic. More important, the characters are well sketched, and their transformation in the game has is credible. Although none of the actors is a big star, the overall impression is of a well acted film. I liked it, and I recommend it for a good, smart and entertaining science fiction movie experience. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thought provoking glimpse at the validity of reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Josef Rusnak's film, produced with the help and experience of Roland Emmerich (director of Stargate, Independence Day, The Patriot), explores with astonishing quality and detail the way life can change when it can be concluded that we are not in total control of our lives.The element of the film that won me over was acting. Granted it wasn't the best performance ever captured on film, but lead actor Craig Bierko delivers a masterful interpretation of software engineer Douglas Hall, 1937 banker Johnny Ferguson, and 2024 engineer/killer David. A perfect scene worth mentioning takes place at the film's conclusion; after David is shot by Detective McBain (another great acting performance by Dennis Haysbert), consciousness is transferred to 2024. With the real Jane (Gretchen Mol), Hall's eyes show the innocence that says it all.Photography is amazingly well-choreographed; blending amazing visual cinematography with expertly designed Computer Graphics. Kirk M. Petruccelli's set designs should have been nominated for an Academy Award; they range from modern sharp-corners and simple colors to the lavish appointments of the 1930s wealthy social class in Los Angeles.All the work of the cast and crew deliver a stunning message: all we perceive as being real may not be. As the world developed by Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) seemed real to those inhabiting it, our surroundings may also be a fantasy world of some futuristic computer engineers. The Thirteenth Floor makes good company with other non-reality films like "The Matrix" and provides support for the fantasy-laden "The Time Machine (2002)."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though the trailer gives away most of the plot - the old switcharoo played not only on the protagonist but on ourselves as well - it's still very entertaining, even chilling, and much more interesting than the usual Us vs. Them Terminator-future of "The Matrix," or the unsatisfying "Open your Eyes" (aka Vanilla Sky). It's also a little (either too, or comfortingly) familiar because the plot is driven by a murder mystery, which perhaps derailed audiences who just wanted to see a single-genre film. However it effectively kept me engrossed (and thankfully did NOT turn into a goofy faux noir like "Bladerunner" with it's ceiling fans and lines like "talk about beauty and the beast, she's both."). Anyone familiar with the Twilight Zone, Star Trek NG, Stanislaw Lem or Phil Dick, won't be too surprised by the concepts presented, but there are some clever new wrinkles, and luckily a hip sense of humor. Also anyone who inwardly grumbles at the yet-again Hollywood nostalgia-inducing yellow tinting of the 1930's will get a chuckle when our hero reemerges to the present and also complains about it to his programmer buddy. My only complaints are the Shaft-like detective(seemed out of place); also Craig Bierko can over-emote, and oddly looks different moment to moment(like a young Raymond Burr, then William Shatner, then Brendan Fraser, etc).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thirteenth Floor" was a very interesting film.This film is giving people a seed of information about humanity's future as some films are these days."It has caused people to wonder what would happen if this were true?"...I know (not believe) that God is ALL THAT IS. Everything that exists is God. Once you come from this perspective it adds a new light to the way things are. This film shows people that there are many dimensions other than the one we live in right now. Films these days that I enjoy most are ones which ask us to question ourselves, about the nature of things and to SEE things differently. Pull apart your ideas and understand why you believe in what you do. This is the first step to understanding that there is more to life than what there seems to be.The thing is that you cannot sense these other dimensions because of the limited range of your senses. Once you train yourself, in various ways, you can 'sense' more of what really is. One of my favourite sayings is "Some things are true whether you believe them or not". This ties in with Universal Law. I have been on a spiritual path for many years to search for happiness within, as it was hard for me to find TRUE HAPPINESS in the world. Little did I know when I started on my path 5 years ago where this would lead me. Truth is stranger than fiction!!!And by the way, I as many do, know that angels are real. And everyone whether you know it or not has spirit guides. Just ask to KNOW (with your inner voice) and you will be guided to what you want to know.Study your dreams - the more you want to remember them the more you do... and the more vivid and understandable they become.Lastly---------- "May the day enlighten you".......I am a Lightworker (Techno Shaman).Peace.</fullReview>

This movie keeps one guessing almost the whole ride, and the end does not disappoint at all. Comparisons to The Matrix are called for, and where The Matrix was over-the-top, The Thirteenth Floor was a bit more subtle. The latter film also benefitted from having a good script, and the acting was better than decent. And while both films blur the line of reality, and both films have their major plot holes, The Thirteenth Floor is just a better overall film.</fullReview>

Coming out on the heels of The Matrix and Existenz and even last year's Dark City, The 13th Floor feels so hideously familiar you wish the project would've been halted in the verbal stage. Trying to take a modern noirish slant on the virtual reality genre, Floor manages to impart loads of production design but minimal amounts of plot, character, and what usually is rampant through these kind of films, wonder. Craig Beirko, the excellent villain from The Long Kiss Goodnight, is squandered along with the luminous Gretchen Mol, and the ever reliable Dennis Haysbert, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Vincent D'Onofrio. Invariably Roland Emmerich having his name attached to this project might be a detriment after last year's Godzilla debacle. Ironically Haysbert starred in a film called Suture a few years back which also dealt with 'virtual' reality but unlike this film, Suture was intelligent, noirish, and had probably a tenth of the budget. Catch that film instead of this one.</fullReview>

My only real problem with the film since I knew it would have Sci-fi channel symptoms going into it, was that every inch of the way I was able to predict what would happen. If you have seen any film with twists or thrills you will probably be able to figure out what they all are in this film before they even hint at it. Other than that complaint, the film itself is interesting and entertaining which is all that can be asked of a lower grade film...right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of several films, released just around the coming of the new millennium, that are all based on a single concept, when you compare them. The interesting thing here is the execution of the concept, and where it's taken. I haven't watched every one of the other movies, but I haven't heard of any of them going where this went. What the concept is or what the other movies are, I won't say here... I would hate to spoil the surprise for anyone who hasn't already seen this film(besides, if you have, you are probably already aware of what titles I am speaking of). If you give it a chance, this can definitely get you thinking, provide plenty of food for thought. The pacing is quite good, and mostly even. The acting is all adequate, and the casting is as it should be. Cinematography and editing doesn't really cover any new ground, but it's fine. The plot is interesting, develops and unfolds nicely, and is well-structured. The characters are well-written and interesting, pretty much all of them. The direction is low-key, but not bad. The effects are very good without ever seeming flashy. If you are considering watching this, I urge you to not look at the cast-list, as it will give away important information best uncovered through watching. This is a rather underrated and very well done science fiction piece that ought to be seen by more people. I recommend it to any fan of science fiction. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll give the film-makers credit for giving it a shot anyway. I thought this film lacked any real suspense, to think of what Hitchcock could have done with this screenplay. The special effects aren't fancy, but they don't have to be, this is a simple film. I'm thankful Dean Devlin didn't write the script, although I can tell Roland Emmerich had something to do with this film. I believe The Matrix handled this subject matter in a much better way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing sci-fi drama that suffers in the last stretch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another "Are we who we think we are?" 1999 sci-fi drama about computer matrixes that are host to our very humanity. Scientist Scott Bierko visits a computer simulation of the 1930s in order to unlock the secret of his mentor's murder. This leads to some rather startling revelations.Bierko is sorely miscast, but he fits into the entire 30s picture quite nicely. Vincent D'Onofrio turns in a good performance as two separate characters related to each other via the computer world.This is an intriguing premise that would have probably been a lot more popular if not for "The Matrix" preceding it by a few months (if memory serves me right). In retrospect, it seems very similar, but it also seems to be coincidence.Too bad the ending was so...silly.3.5/5 stars -- the 1930s evocations are the best of the entire picture.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It all sounds a lot like The Matrix to me. Of course it is a bit unfair to compare any movie to The Matrix. But there really isn't anything refreshing about this movie. And while it all sound very familiar, the whole thing is kind of underwhelming. Agreed, the set-pieces and costumes look great, and there is a lot of potential here, but the director fails to cash in. The 'action-scenes' are just a bit to flat and boring for my taste. There's no pace and it's all unnecessarily complex because in the end the conclusion is kind of superficial and simple.</fullReview>

I spent half the movie trying to figure out what was going on. Gretchen Mol went from the mind-numbing "Rounders"* to this, and Craig Bierko, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Vincent D'Onofrio and Dennis Haysbert sure didn't do themselves any favors by starring in this. That's 100 minutes that I'll never get back. Not even a showing on "Mystery Science Theater 3000" could improve this crap.

		<fullReview>It turns out to have a somewhat similar premise to The Matrix (the world as computer program) but a much more complicated plot and relatively little action or special effects. I'm not quite sure it all holds together, but it was fun watching the filmmakers try. The real action, if you could call it that, takes place in the year 2024, but until almost the very end you think it's alternating between real 1999 and virtual 1937. Toward the end, as you sort out all the rabbit-holes-within-rabbit-holes, you can find, if you think about it, the perfect solution to the heroine's dilemma. The only problem is you might've fallen asleep by then. Drink some coffee and pay attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR (1999) ***Starring: Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Vincent D'Onofrio, Dennis Haysbert Director: Josef Rusnak 120 minutes Rated R (for language and violence) By Blake French: The forth movie to come down the road this year detailing our world being not what it seems is called "The Thirteenth Floor," and is a stunning piece of work that is both involving and challenging. The film once again is futuristic, but not so much as that the audience has a hard time relating to the concepts. Most of the movie takes place in an artificial world, but by the time you'll figure that out it will be two late.Even as the first scene took place, I knew that this would be a very hard film to follow. So I took out my trusty notepad determined that no plot points or important events would get by me. I was correct that the film was not an easy one to hold on two. But given the fact that we have already seen this idea in "The Matrix" earlier this year, I feel that I handled myself in an understandable manner.  The story begins about twenty years in the future, as an elderly man named Hannon Fuller is mysteriously killed, stabbed to death by an unknown person. We later learn that Fuller was conducting a top secret research project that got a little out of control, and in result, he planned to shut it down for good.  The project is a mind machine that allows a person to lie down on it and transform their reality to a world as realistic as our own, in 1930's Las Angeles. The people there are just as real as you and me. They can think, react, and interpret information. However, this device is becoming a little too dangerous. Thus Fuller's attempt to destroy it was interrupted by his graphic death.  We then meet on of Fuller's partners named Douglas Hall, who is at first accused of the murder because he did not want the project to be shut down. The police question him, become suspicious, and ask him not to leave town for a few days. Doug then meets a woman who claims to be the daughter of Fuller, Jane, who makes a puzzling disappearance after showing up at his work site. He soon catches up with her, however, and states the fact that Mr. Fuller had no daughter. Things get very complicated from here.  Craig Bierko's performance is more than capable of getting an Oscar nomination. He is Douglas Hall, and plays out like a "Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hyde" type character. Both his characters are more than clear and believable; this is one of the better performances I have seen this year. Gretchen Mol ("Rounders," 1998) also does quite well in her role, although her character is a bit strained. Vincent D'Onofrio is almost up there with Bierko with a double role, but even he has trouble adapting to the change of environments and climaxes. Armin Mueller-Stahl's character, Fuller, was a pleasure to relate to and endure. I think "The Thirteenth Floor," is what audiences were looking for in last years bomb "Dark City." That film lacked a story. Not to mention it was all over the wall in action. "The Thirteenth Floor," was a vary focused film: The action was pinpointed to only what was necessary to though the plot, the story stays within the boundaries and is solid and thought provoking. The environment was very well developed. The only thing that this movie is missing is a firm grip on reality. That was a joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Germans don't do sci-fi (or how much this movie sucked)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here in the States there's a very funny series of TV commercials for a brand a German beer. They show hillarious situations in which German individuals engage in normal activities using a German engineering approach. You hear a voiceover saying "Germans don't do comedy" and you see a very pathetic stand-up comedian telling bad jokes about factory production lines. You see a cold, passionless, avant-garde interpretation of "Romeo and Juliet" and a voiceover saying "Germans don't do romance." Then they prompt you to enjoy what they claim "Germans do best," which is the advertised beer. The series continues with other hillarious jokes of this sort.Well, after watching this cold, passionless, awfully directed flick, I thought they should also add "Germans don't do sci-fi" to the beer commercial.I could type until Kingdom Come the many, many reasons why this dog is a disaster. There's actually so many, that I'm not even going to list them. I will limit myself to listing just the main categories of "suckage":1- Horrendous direction on the part of Josef Rusnak. "Amateurish direction" doesn't even cut it.2- The writing by Rusnak and Centeno-Rodriguez is quite laughable at times, and unrealistic from beginning to end. The characters lack life. Nobody talks like they do in this movie.3- With the exception of Vincent D'Onofrio, who's always great, acting in this movie SUCKS! Craig Bierko could have been replaced with a crash-test dummy, and Gretchen Mol sounds like she's just reading her lines. It's painful at times.4- Action scenes are so awful they move to laughter! Take a look at the final fight, and it'll remind you of the beer commercial I mentioned above. The character of Jane Fuller should say: I'am being attacked by a psychopathic murdered, so I think I should start running now. At the count of three, start jogging veeeery slowly towards the elevator..."This movie is not even good for rental. Avoid it or wait for it when it appears on network TV. If you want to see better movies on the same subject, check out "The Matrix" and "Dark City."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. I've just finished watching it; literally 10 minutes ago! What do I think? My title should tell you; it's a poor film, possibly a very poor one. The cast is OK at best and more likely poor. Craig Bierko? Just about passable. Too bland really for a lead role. Far too bland. Gretchen Mol? Not bad but not great either. Dennis Haysbert? Underused. He's a powerful actor who isn't really given the chance to show his class. Cinematography? Gorgeous; with shots varying between "very good" and "stunning". Some of the shots of the city from above, by helicopter, at night, are truly stunning. Overall? A film with poor direction, poor acting, cheesy settings, a weak script and more twists than the script can handle. 3/10. How it get's an IMDb 6.8 is utterly beyond me. I've seen really good films that score lower on here. Life is a mystery OK, but avoid this film! Having ranked ~ 1,150 films on IMDb I'd have expected this (having seen it) to have scored a 5 at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One more film on various worlds, one on top of the other and the possible transfer from one to the other through some virtual reality system. Fine with me. But one layer is positioned as dominant and it is the most advanced in time that is. Why? Why not ours? Our time becomes nothing but the past of some other future time that is the real present. That is traumatic since after a while you do not know who is who and who is real or not in any world. Some are not even real at all in any world. The worse part is that you can just get rid of anyone in any layer of time in the past because your real existence is in the future present, the real future present world of 2024. So who cares about what havoc you may cause and create and enjoy in some past layer of the world? But it has no effect on the future because the film states that that future of 2024 is the real thing that commands all the past layers? But why not 3024? And what if 2024 were nothing but some manipulated past of 3024? Disquieting because then time does not exist any more, everything is in the hands of some super-being we don't know. In other words the film reinvents God, not as a real being but as a virtual necessity, a concept without which nothing stands. The film is well done, but the meaning is some absolute submission to some kind of fatality that makes us puppets, and the word is even used. We become irresponsible of our acts and that takes the pleasure out of our life because real pleasure depends on danger and danger depends on risk and risks are always faced in the present never in some kind of past or out of time.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, I am a huge fan of the Matrix. However, the following sequels fell flat and left me very disappointed. The stunning special effects could not overcome a weak story and horrible acting.I was lucky enough to catch The Thirteenth Floor on HBO recently, and I was very impressed. Immediately, I realized that this movie is the logical sequel to the Matrix. Well produced, with good acting, the movie tells a tale of computer simulations, and the possibility that someone can think, feel and love across the boundaries of such simulations. It takes the idea of the Matrix and expands it, by asking the viewer to question not only reality, but the "real".Do yourself a favor...if you're a fan of the Matrix, rent this movie and see if you don't agree with me. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider this one a classic, even though it was probably conceived as a bad imitation of The Matrix. The story is futuristic, romantic and one which starts the audience thinking, which is the marque of an excellent movie. The plot has some interesting twists and turns but the storyline is still is a lot more credible than, for example, The Matrix. For a B-movie the acting and the special effects are top-notch, on par with most A-prime movies. Acting by Craig Bierko and Gretchen Moll isn't top-rate, but still very convincing and professional. Other notable appearances are by Vincent D'Onofrio and veteran actor Armin Mueller-Stahl. The plot revolves around scientists trying to recreate virtual worlds in the computer. One of them is killed whilst travelling to a virtual world looking like 1930's New York. Whilst trying to solve the crime one of the other scientists stumbles upon a horrible secret.</fullReview>

The actors are GREAT in their roles, the "old America" feeling is great. The characters are very well shaped, they do not need ninja capabilities to entertain.

Problem Number 2-- "Strange Days" had an actual plot line and decent acting.

However, this guy never looks the same in any two movies..so hopefully, you won't remember his performance in this bomb since he will probably be unrecognizable in his next project.

I'm sure a good story + a good director + a decent cast (which you can't really blame here) you could pull a movie like this off. Listening to the alternate audio on the DVD it became dreadfully clear that the director was much more interested in sets and color palattes on Photoshop than on...well than on DIRECTING. Yet another failure for Sony, they should stick to making electronics and give up on the film industry...or hire some better directors...or get better screenwriters...actually I find it hard to believe that they could have done a worse job in picking the crew.1 of 5 stars, i.e. if every movie on earth disappeared but this one, I guess you could watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I made an effort to find this now aging movie to see Gretchen Mol, after her stunning performance recently as Betty Page. I found the DVD at my public library. For fans of science fiction this is a really fun movie. As anyone can see from the credits, many actors play two parts, and it often gets confusing, since some of them exist in present time, some back in the 1930s, and some in the future. But even if a viewer can't exactly put all the pieces together accurately, it still is an interesting movie.Craig Bierko as Douglas Hall/John Ferguson/David , Armin Mueller-Stahl as Hannon Fuller/Grierson, Gretchen Mol as Jane Fuller/Natasha Molinaro, always good Vincent D'Onofrio as Jason Whitney/Jerry Ashton, and Dennis Haysbert as Detective Larry McBain out to solve a murder.SPOILERS. Hannon Fuller is murdered, apparently because he was going to recommend the 6-year experimental project be terminated. Many of the characters are not supposed to be real people, instead are nothing but realistic computer simulations. That a character can travel from today to the 1930s as a different person doesn't involve time travel, it is simply traveling into a different simulation matrix. The ending is in 2024, two characters near a beach, happy, but then the scene disappears into a line of light across a screen, as it might look if someone unplugged their electronic "reality".</fullReview>

Production, direction, acting (overall), writing, set design, etc. I kept waiting for commercial breaks.Vincent D'Onofrio is the only one who tries to get more from his character than the script calls for. Craig Bierko was not a good choice for this role - his delivery is flat and stilted (not that the script could have been carried off intelligently by anyone).The story is an interesting one - explored many times on television from the Twilight Zone to the many modern Star Trek series. "13" could have been a great comment on how reality is manipulated by the media, the government, etc. like "The Matrix" was, but instead it relied on the same tired old storyline as its kicker. It is so predictable that it becomes boring. Even "The Truman Show" does better with its anagnoresis.

		<fullReview>I found this movie incredibly frustrating. The plot is crap, because it is completely implausible, due to a single stupid detail in the end, which ruined this whole movie for me.For the rest of you who don't wanna read the whole plot summary.. here's the gist of why I think this movie is crap. There are 3 worlds. Both the 30's and the 90's worlds are simulations. The real world we never see until the end. The way the movie works is that in the future, people wear these Virtual Reality headsets and "jack-in" to the 1990's simulation, and it's like a game to them in the real world (2024). The 1930's simulation is some kind of anomaly created within the 1990's simulation.So the woman Hall keeps meeting (fuller's "daughter") is some guys wife in the real world in 2024, but she falls in love with the "Hall" character in the 1990's simulation. Her husband in the real world gets jealous, "jack's-in" to the Hall character, and kills people in the 1990's world for fun, or out of jealousy, or insanity, who knows...The plot twist is that if you die in these virtual worlds, the consciousness of the character you took over, or "jacked-in" to, takes over your real life body. And can run rampant in the real world. That's where the movie lost all my respect.. I'm sorry.. But even in the future, I'm sure NO business would invent and market a VR game that can kill you for real and replace your mind with an artificial character.. So right there the movie falls apart for me. I'm sorry, I can believe in fantasy, but common sense is common sense..If they had been in some experimental lab testing out the system in the real world, I could have bought it and thought the movie was amazing... but the fact that it's a product as seemingly common as a TV, that everyone would have, that's simply not plausible or believable in any reality. If only the Director had a bit more common sense. le sigh...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot Of People Have Complained About the Ending ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... But I'm afraid that the beginning and the middle isn't much better either ! This is a very strange film that doesn't seem to be able to decide what it's wanting to be . Is it a smart mind blowing technical thriller or is it film noir ? Whatever it is it fails on both counts since the techno thriller aspects are confused and muddled ( Don't forget nearly everyone is complaining about the ending ) while the film noir story is heavily let down by the production values " Let down how Theo ? " You ask me an obvious question like that ? Check the actor playing hero Douglas Hall . I'm afraid Craig Bierko seems to have used William Shatner as as an acting tutor . Hall seems in a permanent state of angst and talks through gritted teeth in nearly every single scene he appears in and this audience member is none the wiser why this should be . The idea of film noir is taken too literally as it's very difficult to see what's happening on screen half the time since the producers seem to have cut costs on the lighting bill which is a shame since the production design might have been good if I could actually make out the sets which I can't I guess THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR might have had potential and there are a few scenes where the plot twists are impressive notably the scene in 1937 when Douglas goes up to a bar and finds the bar tender is ... ! but the overall plot is let down because the script is painfully underdeveloped or has been re-written to death and it's up to you to decide what one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An undeveloped idea, a waste of good time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can not believe how many of these users actually liked this movie! Some people's standards for a movie must be really, really low.First of all, I have to say that I have not seen The Matrix, which was referred to in several users' reviews. So I am not comparing this movie to anything else. My opinions are based on this movie all by itself.It was a mystery. It kept my attention. I wanted to solve the mystery. I kept watching to get an explanation of what was going on, but explanation there was none. During the first part, I thought it was going somewhere. At first, the scenes seemed to make some sense. But as the movie proceeded, the scenes were just made-up incidents that had no relationship to each other or to anything. The movie never did explain things, and as the credits rolled, it still didn't make any sense. The ending just throws the viewer into a complete state of bewilderment, as if all of what went before wasn't bad enough. I mean, you thought you were getting some kind of explanation there for a while, but then the ending just blows that up in your face.What does the title have to do with the film, anyway? If it had anything to do with it, it went past me.The plot idea sounded like a good concept when I read the plot outline. But I was extremely disappointed in the movie. I think you could say that this film only laid out the plot idea but never developed it. It most certainly did not tie loose ends together. I don't understand how anyone could write so poorly. If the plot makes no sense or is otherwise poor, then you have no movie. You just have a bunch of scenes. This so-called movie had a bunch of scenes that were mostly unrelated and that went nowhere. It's a complete waste of time to watch such a so-called movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have either one word or two for this movie, depending on how you look at the word: GOD-AWFUL. No, wait, I have another: MISERABLE. Well, ok, the list could go on.This is The Matrix or Dark City if the director, writers, and producers did everything wrong. I'll give it a semi-cool premise (though one I've seen several times before, and which was done MUCH better in Star Trek: The Next Generation's "Ship In A Bottle" episode), and some really cool sets and costumes, but beauty in this case is not even skin deep.Watching this film was like going through the seven stages of denial; at first you try to like it because, wow, you're seeing a cool movie that just opened. Then, after 30 minutes has passed and they are still setting up the trite, predictable plotline, you think, "well, that's ok, thy have to do something cool eventually." When that doesn't happen, you rationalize "Ok, at least the special effects must be incredible... at some point." When this, now predictably, fails to happen, you think "Alright, I paid $8.25 for this film, I am GOING to enjoy it." When you have finally suffered through the last painful hour, you realize you can, in fact, glean some worth from this film after all: you can enhance your sense of civic duty by warning away the rest of the world.That, my friends, is what I am doing right now, so don't blame me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film which is truly worth avoiding. I fell for the blurb on the cover and ended up watching it. Truth be told, it starts engagingly if not spectacularly. Twenty minutes into the film and predictability sets in. The plot revolves around a highly improbable time travel machine. The cast woodenly repeats the script. There are few if any redeeming features to the film. The acting, music, special effects and plot development are way below par. The flashback sequences (1937) have a certain redeeming feature to them but even they are insufficient to make up for what is a truly mediocre film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>average to bad tv-movie, based on stolen ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've no idea why they showed this in cinema, it never raises over the level of an average tv-movie. Nearly no atmosphere, no style, no remarkable effects, no good jokes, no big surprises and so on and so on. The plot was that of an cheap sf-movie, not more - it was like a very, very cheap variation of The Matrix, without any symbolism or good fighting scenes or such. But at least it has the same logical holes, only far bigger than in the original.The only thing which was really remarkable about this movie was the extremely sweet lover pair. Gretchen Mol is a true beauty, the only reason for men to stay in cinema during this boring picture, just awaiting her next smile with these funny teeth. And Craig Bierko looks much like George Clooney, only his face is a little bit less symmetric. I think anyone with a clue would have made a romantic movie with these two. Well there was a little romance, but not very much.I would state this movie is a waste of time. Better watch Star Treck before you watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was by far the best movie I have EVER seen. Comparing it to The Matrix is just plainly insulting as The Matrix is just a laughable attempt at film-making compared to this one. Anthony Hopkins was smashing as in the days of The Silence of the Lambs and Helen Hunt was just as stunning in every scene as she can be. Truly Oscar material. Right up from the start this movie had me glued to my chair right to the end....yeah right...For the love of God people!!...I didn't even see the ending 'cause I was too busy CRYING over the time I lost watching this worthless, talentforsaken piece of moviegarbage.Incredibly dumb, predictable storyline as seen in lesser episodes of Star trek, Horridly directed from the start, paperthin characters, plastic acting and worst of all a plot twist that would make sane men cry out for their momma's.I'm not saying I'm completely sane, I saw way too many movies of this caliber to be able to make such a claim. But if u did not see this movie yet and are reading this; Please, double please with ketchup on top: Skip this one as u would a bowl of runny eggs gone bad.God do I hate worthless turdmovies like this getting a high rating...and people comparing it to gems like The Matrix while the suckyness of it is so in your face you can't even wash it off with an acid rinse.Seeing people comparing this to The Matrix I'm really surprised how many of you obviously did not get that movie at all.

And why was it only in half the room sometimes? This movie also lacked some level of believability in character development. Sure, a sci-fi will have derivations from the here and now, but to execute it well, some consistency is necessary.I'll rewrite a review after I watch it on video.</fullReview>

I had not heard of the movie and decided to take his word for it that it MUST be good. I was truly disappointed in JOSH'S pick. JOSH has never been known as being one to pick good movies. I should have known. I acted like I was enjoying the movie (for him of course). JOSH truly enjoyed the movie and was captivated from beginning to end. I was falling asleep; yawning the entire time. JOSH also loved Barber Shop. I should have figured it out after that movie right? Not quite. Under Siege is another one of his favorites? Kill me now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the few movies I have seen where it took more effort to stay awake than watch this piece of garbage. In the past when a bad movie was made at least the director would throw in some nudity to make the flick semi-interesting and entertaining. This movie has nothing. Obviously the trend in Hollywood is to crank out as much "what is reality" type movies as possible, and as always most of them will be unwatchable. When it comes out on video, I hope it lists a fastforward time along with the standard running time so one knows how long to keep the button pushed until the end. Don't waste your time on this movie, or at least wait until it is in the buck theatres, which shouldn't be long at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was horrible, and a complete waste of time. I only watched the rest of it to see if it could really be that bad all the way through. To its credit, it's only the first hour that's a complete waste of time and excruciatingly slow-paced.. they could have easily summed that up in 5 minutes and gone on with the last 40 minutes of it and you wouldn't lose anything valuable, but maybe you won't have figured out the entire plot halfway through it like I did.. a friend of mine I was talking to about it figured it out based on my innocuous comments and the commercials he'd seen for it when it was out in theatres. There is very little redeeming about this movie, I would only recommend seeing it if you want to be horrified at how bad it really is or desperately need to waste time.</fullReview>
