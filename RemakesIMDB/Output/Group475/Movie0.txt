		<shortDescription>Welt am Draht changed the way i perceive the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Welt am Draht in German TV when it was broadcast first, sometime 1973 or 74 i guess. I was nine or ten years old then, and it left a tremendous impression on me -- World On Wires is definitely one of my Myths of Childhood.The two or three parts were aired again two or three times, the last time i watched it must have been in the eighties. I recorded them, but, very unfortunately, somehow these tapes got lost in the eddies of reality. It is hard to impossible to find Welt am Draht anywhere these days, which is really sad.Welt am Draht changed the way i perceive the world. It is its credibility, the haunting story, the atmosphere of Germany in the early seventies, the actors, everything. It was very up to date then, and i think it is very much so now. We used to watch a lot of SF on TV, and I remember several serials that were in atmosphere and outlook so close to RWF's Welt, it has almost all melted into a kind of emotion, some sort of dim remembrance of future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead of its time, to say the least!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In these days of ultra-fast processors and the Internet, coming up with a movie like "The Matrix" may seem merely the next step from coining the term 'cyberspace', but do you remember what computers were like in 1974? Right. To come up with the notion of virtual reality back then is truly an amazing feat of the imagination. Fassbinder's movie, of course, has none of the massive gunslinging and pyrotechnics, and a lot of 'artsy' elements instead, but the atmosphere it creates is intense and poses the question how we can know what is real in a dark and gripping manner, making this a chiller and a thriller for the mind. It also takes it up a notch on more recent VR stories: if you get out of one cyberspace, can you be sure you didn't just emerge into another level of virtual reality?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matrix, Dark City, eXistenZ, 13th Floor.....Welt am Draht!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this film is nearly impossible to get a grip on, but the upcoming Fassbinder DVD-Collection (Code 2!) hopefully includes this one. If you are fond of virtual reality stories (and capable of understanding the German language) you might want to look for a video-hunt. This film is truly fascinating, with a great cast of famous (and sometimes notorious...) German actors. It foreshadows everything about VR - because it is the first adaption of the novel "Simulacron", on which "13th Floor" is based as well. "Welt am Draht" is brilliantly shot by Michael Ballhaus and Ulrich Prinz. Although I am not a fan of Fassbinder's works, I really liked the eerie atmosphere and the hilarious 70's design.Rating 9/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I ever saw - why not on VHS, DVD?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies I ever saw - a classic "Matrix" movie. For many years, I have been trying to get it on VHS or DVD - to no avail. The German movie/TV industry still prefers to let valuable cultural contributions (and this is Fassbinder, after all!) rot away and collect dust in some archive rather than distribute it commercially (and make a lot of money with it if that is what stimulates them instead of the promotion of creative thinking). Though, the WDR once told me if I paid DM 200.00 to check the copyright (non-reimbursable), and then DM 8 per minute of copying, plus the cost for the materials, then they will consider preparing a (single!) copy for me. Some way to sell something! The same problem we have with many other TV movies or series like "So weit die Füße tragen", "Sonntagseltern", "Kellerkinder", and others. Excellent TV series - never to be heard of again. Germany, wake up!UPDATE from March 2007: Last year, I finally could get a DVD copy from the "Mittschnittservice" of the WDR for about 50+ Euro. Great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part 1 of Fassbinder's sci-fi foray, World on a Wire is quite good. I always like his direct, theatrical style. He opens with some references to 2001 -- white plastic futuristic decor, space opera music -- to set the tone. Then there's a whole lot of Alphaville -- hosts of blank expressions held artificially long -- and early Godard. And sure enough Eddie Constantine even has a small role near the end of Part 2.It's a very Matrixy premise, from way back in 1973, of a world of people, termed identity units, created artificially in a supercomputer as an experimental control group, with the goal of predicting future human behavior and learning what to avoid/promote. There is an element of Big Gov't social engineering, and then companies move in to try to learn future demand (Big Steel is the baddie here, which is a little dated). In other words, it's just like today's world, with all of us trying to become identity units for Google to track ... or somesuch. The Thirteenth Floor (1999) is also based on the same novel "Simulacron 3" by Daniel F. Galouye.Fassbinder uses lots of mirror shots to disorient and question the reality of identity and the nature of reality. With the camera often tracking over to mirrors, or starting with mirror images which only become apparent when the camera tracks a person's movement away from and out of a mirror. The room housing the supercomputer has a couple of fully mirrored walls, which gives it a sleek futuristic look, and acts as a visual metaphor for the layers of reality/unreality.I especially liked seeing Fassbinder regulars pop up. El Hedi ben Salem plays a bodyguard/security agent; Barbara Valentin a sexy secretary/ corporate spy. This was originally done for German television, and Fassbinder uses some of these actors for his later TV opus Berlin Alexanderplatz. There is a weird sequence in World on a Wire, where Gottfried John's character takes over Gunter Lamprecht's body (which in BA terms is Reinhold taking over Franz Biberkopf, which has eerie resonance).I was a bit underwhelmed with the extra: Fassbinder's World On A Wire: Looking Ahead To Today, but it did shed light on the casting. The fearless 27 year old Fassbinder used many older ex-stars for the project, an interesting decision to go retro to obtain a slightly futuristic feel -- similar to Godard's choice of Eddie Constantine in Alphaville. Fassbinder wants something to be a little off and odd about the characters, and so he uses past-their-prime actors, has them stare blankly unnaturally long, and dresses them up in costumes, distinctly retro, which they wear like costumes. This style creates a unique look and feel to the whole proceedings, distinctly off and slightly phony, accordant with the artificial reality theme.The second half of World on a Wire is a little weaker. Part 2 becomes a paranoid thriller, as Fassbinder mostly focuses on the psychological aspects and the chase/hunt for the man who knows too much about the different levels of reality. And actually that's a joke Fassbinder tosses in. The focus is on a lone man wrongfully accused and caught up in a vast conspiracy. Less than one minute after I said to myself, Gee, this is becoming rather Hitchcockian, Fassbinder has a character refer to another's death by saying, "poor Franz Holm, a man who knew too much." Wink.Part 2 is similar to such political/corporate conspiracy films as Parallax View, but now I see that Wire came out the year before Parallax. And Soylent Green came out just a few months earlier. Interesting. Altogether World on a Wire is nearly 3' 20", and it probably could have used a bit of trimming and tightening in the second half. But this is really an interesting addition to the Fassbinder legacy. Quite a treat for Fassbinder fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting topic and a good reflection of the 70´s life style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this film the first time I was very impressed concerning the kind of atmosphere the director creates. It is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in the year 1974. If you see the film you will see a lot of sets and customs which are called freaky and modern again today.The topic of the film deals with the old question "What is real and what is illusion?". If you see "The Matrix" you will find a lot of similarities. But the two films are not comparable at all because "Welt am Draht" is art and "The Matrix" is entertainment. If prefer the first one.Unfortunately I lost my video copy of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy / Cheesy Early 70's Cyber-Sci-Fi with an Edge!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HIGHLY recommended to fans of classy/cheesy 70's sci-fi, very early "cyberpunk", and vintage German film: the recently re-"discovered" and restored, creepy mind-bender "Welt am Draht" ("World on a Wire") originally shot on 16mm film and presented as a 2-part miniseries on West German television in 1973. while it's obviously quite long, starts out kinda slow, flounders at times in cheesy existentialism, has no special effects to speak of, and has been ripped off so much it almost seems clichéd at this point (the massively inferior 1999's "The Thirteenth Floor" was based on the same book, and similar concepts have cropped up in a variety of stories throughout sci-fi...) it was SO far ahead of its time that it still packs a lot of relevant futuristic cyber-bite, albeit with a VERY sweet, classy retro style. it's very much an "intellectual" James Bond in Alphaville, though with some "2001" flourishes of design and cinematography... maybe not the greatest of masterpieces, but such an influential and unique sci-fi classic, it really should be seen by any fan of the genres or style, especially for the first time in decades!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The more powerful the class, the more it claims not to exist, and its power is employed above all to enforce this claim. It is modest only on this one point, however, because this officially nonexistent bureaucracy simultaneously attributes the crowning achievements of history to its own infallible leadership. Though its existence is everywhere in evidence, the bureaucracy must be invisible as a class. As a result, all social life becomes insane." &#x2015; Guy DebordWerner Fassbinder's "World on a Wire" was first released on German television in 1973. Forgotten for decades, it reappeared in 2010 with new prints and a theatrical release, at which point it was quickly embraced as one of cinema's hidden milestones.Pre-dating "The Matrix", "Blade Runner", "Inception", "Existenz", "Dark City", "Ghost in the Shell", "Paprika", "Strange Days", "Star Trek" ("Ship in a Bottle", "Projections") and many other similar works, "Wire" stars Klaus Lowitsch as Fred Stiller. Stiller's working with the Institute for Cybernetics and Future Science, who are busy creating an artificial world populated by thousands of sophisticated A.I. "identity units". The film was based on "Simulacron 3", a 1964 novel by Daniel Galouye. Philip K. Dick's "The Simulacra" was published the same year."Wire's" first half plays with now familiar questions of phenomenology (what constitutes experience, perception and consciousness?), epistemology (what is knowledge and how is it acquired?) and ontology (what constitutes the self, existence and reality?). Here Stiller realises that he is in fact a computer simulation of the Real Fred Stiller. This baffles poor Fred, as he has also recently created a computer simulation of "himself". The film thus offers a series of nested realities, simulations boxed within simulations boxed within simulations. When the "identity units" recognise that they are "not authentic", they begin to view others as phony automatons, have little existential crises and slip into depression. Some exhibit the existence denial of Cotard's Syndrome ("I think that I don't exist!"). Others resort to suicide.Like Fassbinder's "identity units", humans are themselves "machines who are not aware that they are machines". Each of us is mechanistically programmed by an unbroken causal chain, and what we "see" is itself a mental simulation or representational content. The claims of "naive realists" (the belief that senses provide direct awareness) are similarly false. Our phenomenal life unfolds in a world-model and we are always blind to the mediums through which "things" are transmuted en-route to us. Thinkers like Hume, Schopenhauer, Locke, Sartre, Daniel Dennet and many other modern neuroscientists have also dethroned the notion of the Sovereign Self. For them, selfhood only exists at the level of false appearances. It is an accidental byproduct of processes which misrepresent "themselves" for "itself", and even consciousness only arises "after the fact", always dependent on objects which the subject is inadvertently constructed in relation to. Other philosophers are equally, or overly, droll. "The brute fact is that there is nothing behind the face," Thomas Metzinger would say. "There's no one there." And Erwin Schrodinger: "To learn that the personality of a human being cannot really be found in the interior of a human body is so amazing that it meets with doubts and hesitation, we are very loath to admit it." But Fassbinder, a neo-Marxist, has always been more interested in the political. Like many of his pictures, "Wire" thus paints late capitalism as a superstructure which co-opts everything it touches. This is a giant control society, a kind of giddily embraced techno-totalitarianism in which everything is under surveillance, personalities are managed and created, everyone is an automaton lost in their own private cyberspational urgencies, capitalism has fully colonised human consciousness and machines simulate reality whilst people simulate "individuality" and "authenticity". "You're nothing more than the image others have made of you!" characters say. More than this, "Wire" portrays "reality" as a collective psychosis in which all social energy is sucked into a vortex of labour and simulated productivity. The simulations made by The Institute, we later learn, are themselves intended for the prediction of future market trends, the "identity units" (and the whole world itself) literally created for the purpose of monitoring buying, selling and consumption. More eerily, the simulations within the simulations seem designed to investigate how people react to certain forms of control; a dry run for a total conversion which will soon occur, or may already have. Regardless, with the help of the "identity units", Germany's economy can be meticulously pre-planned and engineered. This kind of Big Data Mining is already occurring ? the superstore Target famously mailed pregnancy kits to a teenage girl, successfully predicting her pregnancy before the girl, her family, lover or father knew she was pregnant ? computerised pattern detectors already surmising from and shaping behaviour. Elsewhere Fassbinder shows, not just the political cost of distraction, but how distraction and solipsism are desired by those on every level of society. The Real Fred Stiller programs himself as a suave ladies man, humans love the idealisations sold to them by their digital echo chambers and the Masters rake in the cash whilst everyone remains oblivious. Meanwhile, those pesky "identity units" who wreak the party are "deleted" or "suicided" with the flip of a switch. The film's overriding metaphor (Zeno's Paradox), points to a world in which everything moves but no distance is travelled and no progress is made.Aesthetically, "Wire" gives us mirrored surfaces, alienating spaces and a style which mixes noir, SF and retro-futurism. Its signature song is Wagner's "Tristan and Isolde", used as an ironic commentary on the idealisations of Fassbinder's characters, but perhaps chosen because it was itself inspired by Schopenhauer's "The World as Will and Representation". The film ends with a playboy and playgirl in a box, spinning in false assumptions.8.5/10 - Masterpiece but overlong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes!!!! Fassbinder and Ballhaus are at the top of their game, back in 1973! It's about the same subject, but in my opinion it's a much better movie than THE MATRIX (1999), at least it was 200 times cheaper! Very nice camera work by Michael Ballhaus and the wonderful "Albatross" by Fleetwood Mac at the end. Fassbinder is creating a very moody tone for the whole film. It's a shame this movie was never released on DVD. But now after 37 Years they finally came to the conclusion, that this TV-Movie, is not only one of the best Fassbinder films (altough there are quiet a lot best Fassbinder films), it's a brilliant example for a science-fiction movie, done without much money. Buy it!! Watch it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing scifi epic...without the special effects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rainer Werner Fassbinder made World On A Wire for German TV back in 1973. It has been little seen since, but restored it has been giving an airing at MIFF. It is an epic, time wise, running at a good 3? hours its quite an undertaking, but well worth it.The story set some time in the future, though it's never stated when is about a super computer that can create alternate realities where 'units' exist as people living as normal going on with their lives utterly unaware that they are simply computer programs. Of course things start to go wrong and one man Fred Stiller (played by the utterly handsome Klaus Lowitsch) begans to investigate. Things become more complex as the plot unravels and revelations are told and truths uncovered.It's a fascinating concept and one that is explored in an real environment. There are no special effects here, the world we are presented with is just as we would expect it, though it was made in the 70's, there is a slight futuristic nature to the design, but it doesn't look dated. The design itself is wonderful and looks great 30 years on. There are some amusing moments, odd moments of acting, characters turning around really quickly or spinning around on chairs. Whether there was a reason is unclear or perhaps it was just bad acting. However the cast do a good job and it is never played anything but straight.Despite it's non CGI approach, the film works as an intriguing and engaging story, as it draws to it's conclusion the concept leaves the audience questioning the idea of reality. It is a story that has been presented more recently with films such as Dark City and especially so in The Matrix Trilogy. Both are superb sci-fi films that present the idea of alternate worlds or realities, but with World On A Wire which was decades ahead of these recent films, the story is presented in a superb 'real' format without the lashings of effects we are used to.More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of Fassbinder's best works, but it's certainly interesting, and the visuals are exceptional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently rediscovered TV film made by Fassbinder in the mid-70s, it's an early film dealing with the sci-fi concept of virtual reality. The subject became really popular in the late 90s with the mega-hit The Matrix and several other more cultish flicks like Dark City, eXistenZ and The Thirteenth Floor (which was actually based on the same novel as World on a Wire). This is notably less cheesy than a lot of 70s sci-fi, though 70s styles are ever-present in the decor. I don't know if I'd say it's as fun as some of those cheesy 70s sci-fis, though. The film is split into two parts, and, as a whole, runs about three and a half hours. They probably could have cut it down a lot, because it really drags at times. The one thing I really love about it is the visuals. It might be Fassbinder's most visually resplendent work. I doubt someone watching it on a television screen in 1973 (probably the great majority watched it in black and white) could have appreciated the gorgeousness of it. The Criterion Blu Ray is gorgeous and very unique looking. As long as it was, the visuals always kept me enthralled. Like a lot of early Fassbinder films, it's a bit dry and could use some more interesting characters - he became a much better director starting around this same time when he started embracing melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting and futuristic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This quite unknown movie impresses the viewer the longer one watches! Even more than 40 years after the release the idea of powerful computers being able to influence our lives has not yet reached the reality in a way as Fassbinder shows us. The camera settings are fascinating, regarding the actors especially Klaus Löwitsch representing Fred Stiller impresses in his actions. His ability to make the viewer believe the character he represents gives his role as a quite simple looking technical director (though he calls himself scientist) a certain kind of deepness. The female actors represent very much the type of woman of the 1070s as of course the total outfit of the furniture. I was amused that the same curtain with particular circular pattern shown in the movie can be found in our old weekend house. Mascha Rabben as Eva is convincing but not comparable to the acting of Klaus Löwitsch (Stiller). At first I thought a movie of 3 1/2 hours of that kind must be too long, but I would't like to miss one minute of it. The reason for only 8 points is the virtual reality movies are not my favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artificial reality movie with a different focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The SF premise isn't unique (although it pretty much was back then), but the focus is a completely different one than in other artificial reality films. Especially during the first part it is an elaborate crime picture, that uses the SF premise to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of vanishing characters and unhelpful witnesses who don't have to lie to be unhelpful. Instead of an unreliable narrator we have an unreliable world.In part two we follow the main character's struggle for sanity and it turns more into a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation. He knows his very existence is nothing more than electrical impulses, how does he deal with this knowledge? He knows that there is a world that is more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where nobody can understand him. The problem of thinking of knowing something essential about the world that nobody else knows or wants to believe is a very real one that many of us can identify with. For me the film transports this hopelessness very well, with its dreary, artificial atmosphere which also supports the factual artificiality of the film's world.Other than 'The Matrix' or 'The Thirteenth Floor' it's little concerned with evoking a sense of awe for its artificial reality plot, instead it very much focuses on the psychological aspects. Philosophy is only in so far interesting in that certain philosophical concepts are essential in how they shape and alter the character's perception of the world.Arguably it is longer than it has to be (which isn't a problem if you are as captivated by it as I was) and part 2 runs pretty low on steam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>R.W. Fassbinder as Cybernetician</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an interesting fact that metaphysics by Platon and Aristoteles, formal logic and abstract ontology form about those sciences that most people are not interested in. But then, around one thousand years after Aristoteles, the computer began to usurp the human thinking, and the humans who were refusing to reflect questions of being other than biological, physical and chemical ones, suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences that this computers would bring "over night". R.W. Fassbinder's "Welt Am Draht", together with Tarkovsky's "Solaris" and Godard's "Alphaville", is probably the first movie who took the philosophical questions of emerging computer science as a basis of a story to be told in a movie. The confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly built into different interwoven criminal stories which the audience really tries to follow because it is interested to solve the cases. Fassbinder was a master to sell highly abstracts contents to his public by embedding theoretical knowledge into practical, appetizing forms. The basis problem to understand is that an identity defines a reality, but on the other side, a reality also requires identity in order to be perceived. The idea of a person with multiple identities is known to us solely from the standpoint of psychiatry. However, logically spoken, the only reason why we have just one identity, is the fact that our logic has only two values (right and false). Now take a logic with just one more value, i.e. with three: Then, as you can easily see, you have already three identities. What happens now, when, let us say, Dr. Stiller gets killed? Then, it is quite possible that only one of three identities is abolished and the other two remain and are able to rescue the individual from death. Another question is, if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once. The idea, however, to display such sets of identities in a up-down or down-up way as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel, is misleading, since identities and hence realities are not structured in Hierarchical, but in a Heterarchical way. Strictly speaking, there is no "artificial identity" either, since each identity is defined over two objects who share all of their features with one another. Therefore, the idea of assuming that every individual has just one single identity is nothing but a consequence of ancient two-valued logic either (a second identity would imply that a person, at the same time, exists and not-exists). But now look around and see that one and the same object (which is by definition self-identical) is perceived by every subject in its own way. If therefore every subject sees an object differently, why should it no be possible for the single individual to open the borders of his two-valued individuality-corset, with the effect that different persons can exchange their different Individualities? Fassbinder would five years later pick up this topic in his masterpiece "Despair. A trip into the light".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fassbinder and sci-fi?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Welt am Draht" is a German movie from over 40 years ago written and directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. At 3 hours it is certainly among his longest works, which is only one difference from his usual approach. He rarely crossed the 2-hour mark in his other films. Then again, this one here is really 2 films in one. "World on a Wire" consists of 2 90-minute films basically. The lead actor is Klaus Löwitsch, who may not be alive anymore, but his name is still known here in Germany. And the cast includes other known names and regular Fassbinder actors, such as Lommel, Valentin, Lamprecht, Hoven, Raab, Carstensen, Caven and John. This may not seem spectacular today, but back in the 1970s this was among the best Germany had to offer. Fassbinder was still in his 20s when he made this one and yet it was far from early in his career. He was already a most prolific filmmaker at this point.Sadly, the cast does not match the film in this case. I may be a bit biased as I am not the greatest Fassbinder admirer in general, but nonetheless, there are films by him that I quite enjoy ("Angst essen Seele auf" / "Warum läuft Herr R. Amok"), Not so this one. I am also not too big on science fiction usually, so it was not a great combination to be honest. I also felt that Fassbinder's approach to film does not really work with the genre. His films are often beautiful in terms of set decorations etc, but very depressing in terms of character elaboration and the behavior he depicts in people. From that perspective, it is easy to recognize Fassbinder in here. So yeah, to me this film felt overlong and uninteresting, even if there were a couple decent scenes. But far from enough to me to let me recommend it. It was actually closer to a */***** than ***/***** for me. Thumbs down. One of Fassbinder's weaker films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen "The Thirteenth Floor" (1999), but it's 16 years ago, so luckily I remembered next to nothing about the story, which in this instance, although I'm barely one to be put off by knowing what's going to happen, is certainly a plus. (They're based on the same novel, in case you're wondering what I'm talking about.) Fassbinder's adaptation of Daniel F. Galouye's novel "Simulacron?3" is certainly massive. Made for TV in 1973, it's in two parts that total a runtime of 205 minutes. But it is far from overlong, which says something since, when all's said and done, not that much happens. But what makes the film so entertaining is Fassbinder's total command of his craft, and that insatiable, sinuous sense for cinematic adventure that not only reflects but largely defines the narrative itself. The camera lurks behind objects, it's sometimes inescapably lost, reflections are used a lot. Fassbinder's repertoire is so varied it's amazing. The narrative pushes forward with relentless gusto and with appropriate predetermined sense of discovery.In a wonderfully exuberant filmography "World on a Wire" not only shines, it's actually one of the best sci-fis out there, a worthy companion to "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968), Solaris (1972) and "Stalker" (1979). More modern fare that has explored nested realities in the mainstream, namely "The Matrix" (1999) and "Inception" (2010), will be a great deal more interesting because of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World On A Wire that is literally what the Matrix came from and is connected to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not a lot or drama style SciFi's that manage to capture me. 2 examples would be the tediously boring 'Solaris' and 'Stalker' and I mention these as these films came out around the time that World On A Wire was released. World on a wire however enthralled and amazed me.Not surprisingly this was a TV movie that aired in 2 parts. It's all in German but now available on DVD and Bluray and features as one of the pride and joys of the excellent 'Criterion Collection' and for good reason.The entire story runs around 3 hours and if your the kind of person that needs an action scene every 2 minutes or looses concentration then this seriously isn't the film for you. However if your the kind of person that enjoys thought, imagination, excellent dialogue and well thought out drama, then this is definitely for you.World On A Wire is without doubt where the concept of 'The Matrix' came from. Here I was thinking it was an incredible imaginative idea when in reality, World On A Wire already achieved that and without multi-million dollar special effects, without an action scene every 5 minutes and completely with some of the best story telling by drama dialogue I have ever scene in a movie.While I'm not fluent in German, I know a little and with the subtitles picking up the story was certainly not an issue at all. The amazing aspect of this film is how well they achieve the goal and later on you realise why the people are acting the way they are, why events occurred, how it all links together. It's simply a work of awe inspiring genius. Hollywood could learn an awful lot about good story telling and excellent drama through studying 'World On A Wire'. There were times when for a film of it's age I was absolutely tongue tied as to how good this was. How amazingly the writer got the entire concept so spot on and how from the present moment in 2015, we could very well start seeing the first such virtual world as World On A Wire.Seriously I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's got to be one of the best movies ever made and seriously goes to show you that you don't need millions upon millions of dollars worth of special effects and flashy wiz bang CGI etc to make a good movie. What you really need is a great idea, a good story and most importantly of all, good character interaction.World On A Wire achieves this and is now without a doubt one of my favourite SciFi films of all time. In fact, I found it better than the Matrix which relied a lot on shock value and the wiz bang effects to achieve the awe which World On A Wire achieved simply through good story telling. The way in which the dialogue reveals the story and the subtle use of the actors and props to slowly ebb you into the realisation was impeccably commendable and I wish I could meet the writer and shake there hand. What's most scary about World On A Wire for this recent fan, is that it came out 26 years before the Matrix and did so much more with less. With World On A Wire I found myself wanting to know more about the characters. With The Matrix, while I enjoyed the first film, the sequels really annoyed and ruined the goodness which the first film delivered. By comparison World On A Wire captivates and keeps you interested throughout.Not a film for everyone, but for those who understand the importance of good story writing and character interaction, your going to be enthralled and you'll really enjoy this film.One of the greatest Science Fiction films ever made in my firm opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frozen world on a wire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, made for TV in 1973 and consisting of two parts with a total length of more than three hours, certainly can seem a bit slow-going at times. However, there's so much internal tension in the slowly unfolding story that at the end, it doesn't feel too long or drawn-out at all. This is also thanks to the splendid performance by Klaus Löwitsch who convincingly plays the main character as a man who almost frantically tries to keep his guarded, restrained demeanour as his environment gets more and more puzzling and threatening. If we compare "World on a Wire" with the later adaptation "The Thirteenth Floor" which is based on the same book, the earlier film is a much more interesting experience - more layers, more depth, more interesting actors. Craig Bierko's interpretation of the main character in "The Thirteenth Floor" is not a tenth as interesting as Löwitsch's performance - I can't find the emotion in Bierko's "Douglas Hall" character, the self-doubt, the despair... it's all there in Löwitsch's "Fred Stiller". And "World on a Wire" isn't just a pioneering movie, it's also strangely timeless despite the prevalent seventies design. With the very clear, fine picture of the current DVD restoration it doesn't feel dated. It's a strange, half frozen world seemingly not entirely connected to reality - which of course fits the theme very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great ideas in a too long movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the Matrix or anything similar there was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's two part television movie about a new super computer that is being used to run a simulation of the real world that you can go into. Of course as its getting closer to going on line strange things begin happening and people are dying- what is going on? Good if over long (each part is 100 minutes) story dealing with many of the scifi ideas that are now so hip and happening- only this was done almost 40 years ago.Its a good film only I found that the pace made me force my way through. The first half was an interesting but tough slog. The second half moves better since much of the ground work has been laid. Its worth a look for scifi fans and those who want to ponder what is real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Sience Fiction Movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During my teens or should I say prime time I was "eating up" all kinds of SF novels every day of the week. It was in the Sixties and Seventies when TV was not such a important leisure time killer like today, one night in the mid seventies I watched the movie on TV I think it was ARD and I was stunned. I was impressed in a way that I can almost remember each scene even today.Nowadays I observe my kids playing the SIMS or something like that and I think we are close to what that Fassbender Movie expressed. I also would highly appreciate if I could buy this movie on a DVD. But in vain I tried almost everything to get a hint where. The movie MATRIX cannot touch by far the quality and the state of art of this movie. And by the way by now we do not have a glue if we were a superior reality or just one of a couple simulation models. Probably after our death we definitely will know...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Might Be Officially A Masterpiece but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine you were a young film-maker, who lived in Germany in the olden days, before the adoption of the Selectric typewriter. You had no budget. Your costumes had to come from attics and thrift stores. No CGI, no stunts, no special effects, no sets. About all you could afford is some make-up, wigs and fake beards. You could not even afford professional lighting, but you had an idea for a subtle scifi film. You were however, able to persuade a number of wealthy people that filming in their homes would bestow prestige. How could you get someone to fund the movie? You might make a prototype proof of concept picture, like a visual screenplay.That would be this film. However, actually, it was 1973 and Rainer Werner Fassbinder had already made 21 films. West German TV funded it. Perhaps there is another explanation for the amateurishness.To appreciate it, you really have to use your imagination to ignore the loud checked jackets and secretaries wearing dresses last worn by saloon dancers, and the absurd hairstyles.It is in German. The voices are very clear. It is surprising how many individual words you can understand in German with hints from the sub titles. However, all other sound is muddy.Actors mostly say things that don't seem to make any sense, or that are coherent but apparently irrelevant. The characters are just as puzzled as you about what is going on. The total effect though does create a complex alternate reality.One thing the film explores, quite an issue for gay men, is the way the physical appearance of others has such a strong power over us.The pace is slow. There is a lot of padding. Somebody might edit it down to make a more coherent film.It is a clever film, but not an enjoyable one. I know Roger Ebert gave it 3 stars, but I found it very boring, but then I consider Last Year at Marienbad the worst film I have ever seen. So what do I know? I even think the Matrix is a much better realisation of a similar idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead of its time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welt am Draht may very well be ahead of its time story-wise on a philosophical level discussing aspects of the modern man vs. machine and maybe the totalitarian regime topics. The Matrix definitely borrows the best aspects of this movie.But if you take a look at the screenplay, timing, editing, acting, sound editing, visual effects and production design I have never seen a movie that looks so hopelessly outdated. Maybe that's the price for trying to make an ultra modern avantgardistic film, or it's just the result of trying to put too much (or too little) effort into a philosophical/intellectual sci-fi/action movie of 200 minutes.I'm sorry that I didn't find more positive aspects to point out, especially considering Rainer Werner Fassbinder reputation but all the mentioned downsides made the 2010 remastered DVD version nearly unwatchable for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly Paced Sci-Fi Failing Miserably Where Other Genre Pictures Shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film off a restored 35mm print in a theater recently (2011) based on critical praise, and they were just plain wrong about its merits. Save your dollars.If what you're looking for is a Sci-Fi film that very loosely weaves an interesting concept around the thinnest story possible, then this film is for you. But if you're looking for a compelling story, digging deep into its interesting concept, through strong performances and beautiful compositional cinematography, worthy of the world it tries to create, then look elsewhere. Half the audience walked out after the first half. I stayed begrudgingly through the second part too, as it was split into two parts. During the intermission, I overheard someone mention when this film screened at the Museum of Contemporary Art in California many audience members walked out there too.To the film's credit, the second half is slightly better than the first, but that's saying very little. The entire film, filled with unfelt exposition, amounts to a 70's "talkie" that's not "strange" enough to keep your attention nor filled with vivid enough cinematographically arresting images, conveying clear concepts or ideas that challenge your intellect, such as you'd find in "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "Klute" for example.Some films capture a strangeness of mood that resonates so perfectly their content becomes somewhat irrelevant, but this is not one of those films. With some finessing of the score, "World On A Wire" could have been somewhere among the likes of a "Suspiria", "Blind Dead Trilogy", or "The Kingdom ('94)". Poor pacing, lack of irony, and next to no levity in this plodding narrative are all good reasons to avoid this or, at the very least, to make into a rental for the sci-fi curious.</fullReview>
