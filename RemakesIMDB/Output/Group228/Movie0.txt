		<shortDescription>They'll have to think up a lot of new adjectives...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's little new I can probably add here, judging by the amount of comments, but here goes. King Kong is still one of the greatest fantasy films. It has inspired generations of filmmakers, writers, and other artists, all of whom have been awed and thrilled by the level of craftsmanship involved in its creation. The film haunted my nightmares as a child; there was something absolutely frightening about Kong's glaring eyes looming in the windows of the wrecked elevated train. Thanks to television and repeated showings every Thanksgiving for years (thanks WOR) I became smitten with this film. Nearly 30 years later- post the 1976 remake, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Lord of the Rings, etc, I still sit down every few months to watch Kong. EVERY time, I see something new. The detail they put into this film is phenomenal, considering it was released long before television or VCRs could give viewers a chance to watch it enough to notice the more subtle details. Volumes have been written about this movie's production, but one effect still has me puzzled. When Kong is in his cave, just before he sets Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) in a small opening in the rocks, the head of the elasmosaurus can be seen surfacing and submerging in the pool behind him. If it was done in stop motion, it's the smoothest work in the film; even the pool's water actually appears to ripple around the head.Willis O'Brien is the man primarily credited with bringing King Kong to the screen, but in truth, Kong was the brainchild of Merian Cooper, a truly larger-than-life film producer, on whom the character of Carl Denham was modeled. Cooper had been a fighter pilot in World War I, a POW after he was shot down behind enemy lines, and- with his partner Ernest Schoedsack- had traveled to the wilds of Asia and Africa to film documentaries. Cooper imagined King Kong as the logical extension of his true life exploits; exaggerated but a recognizable caricature of his experiences. Originally he had wanted a real gorilla to portray Kong, and even wanted to have it fight a Komodo dragon! (Call the Humane Society!) We can all be grateful he encountered Willis O'Brien (who was working on his own dinosaur film- Creation) and decided to produce Kong and the monsters of Skull Island using stop-motion. I doubt anyone in 1933 could have tolerated the spectacle of a live gorilla in real combat with a Komodo dragon. I suspect the film would have either been banned outright or been little more than a grisly footnote in motion picture history. The idea was Cooper's, but the majesty and spectacle of the film belong to O'Brien. The miniature jungle settings created by O'Brien's crew with multiple glass paintings created an otherworldly quality to Skull Island that could not be duplicated by shooting on location- as Cooper had originally envisioned.To be sure, the film is very much a product of a simpler time. However, if the acting in Kong is compared to its early 1930's contemporaries in the horror/fantasy genre, it holds up quite well. Cooper and Schoedsack understood the necessity of establishing the characters before Kong's entrance, but kept dialog to a minimum. The story is told visually, with camera-work furthering plot points that may have seemed didactic otherwise. The film is carried by not only its visual imagery, but by one of the first feature length music scores. This was an innovation that put King Kong ahead its sound contemporaries, which relied quite heavily on the spoken word and direction alone. There is a ten minute sequence in the center of the film- after the death of the tyrannosaurus until the escape of Ann and Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot) from Kong's lair- that is told entirely with visuals, music, and sound effects. It is in large part due to the score that much of Kong's emotional impact is conveyed, particularly in its finale atop the Empire State Building. Steiner was able to suggest Kong's emotional state, assisting O'Brien in providing empathy to a creature who in reality was only an 18 inch high puppet.It is a mistake to compare Kong technically or artistically with films from later decades. Consider the cultural context in which King Kong was produced. America was in the darkest days of the Depression. World War II was seven years away, and nobody outside of a few physicists knew what 'atomic bomb' meant. Kong truly was the 'Eighth Wonder of the World' just as the Empire State Building was at the time considered the greatest technological marvel. As Cooper envisioned it, Kong was an adventure escapist film, offering Depression-Era audiences something that at the time would be considered the 'ultimate in adventure.' Whether or not Peter Jackson's proposed remake of Kong can maintain these qualities of showmanship and adventure is a matter of wait and see: to today's audiences Kong no longer represents something 'all powerful' or able to 'lick the world' as Carl Denham described him back in 1933. Even setting the remake in 1933 will have its difficulties, since the film will then be a period piece rather than a contemporary story, as both the original film and the 1976 remake were, and audience involvement may be more limited.Like Star Wars, King Kong was a made for the movies myth, not based directly on any previous source other than Cooper and O'Brien's imagination. It spawned one of the first monster movie sequels, one remake, (so far) and countless imitations, parodies, and merchandise. Among fantasy films, only the Wizard of Oz can rival King Kong for the sheer longevity of popularity, but while Oz provided escapist entertainment, it did so in a lighter fashion. Kong provided escapism but of a more disturbing and haunting kind.Here's to ya, Obie, and Coop!Oh no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some aspects of KING KONG people forget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the 1933 version of KING KONG, is for me, the greatest fantasy film ever made. Sure, there are fantasy films with far better special effects (THE MATRIX, JURASSIC PARK) better acting (the acting here is of the period!) but KING KONG is a film of tremendous excitement. The suspense, pacing, sensuality, violence all adds up to a blood pumping experience. We all read about the film's history, being made, released, censored, restored, and how it's been picked to itsy-bits by every arm-chair film "expert".What very few film-makers have focused on is the film-making itself in KING KONG. It has superb build-up. We are wondering what is on the island as we approach it. Then we wonder what is behind the wall on the island. Then we wonder what gigantic beast is sharing that frightening jungle with the rescuers, trying to save Fay Wray. The film is faultlessly edited. Many scenes begin or end with people running for their lives. Unneeded scenes just don't exsist (we go from Kong knocked out on Skull Island to his Broadway debut. We don't need to see what happens inbetween!) then there's Max Steiner's perfect music score. Before KONG, most music scores were borrowed snippets of classical or popular themes, but Steiner's score follows the action to an inch! Also, he does a great number of abstract musical strokes (I.e the clash of drums when Kong beats the giant snake to it's death. The lovely string piece that jumps to pulsating chase music in a milli-second.) When I hear of a friend say they never saw this film, it's like hearing a child say they never had ice cream. Long Live Kong!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They weren't just making a film when they made this one.... they were inventing rules and ideas that would be followed for decades to come.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many films can truly be said to be definitive? The answer is probably "not many", but the original 1933 version of King Kong is certainly one of them. For its time, every aspect is innovative. First-of-their-kind special effects, first-of-its-kind plot, famous performances and a final sequence that remains unequalled as an eye-popping cinematic experience. The quality of cinematography and visual trickery has progressed a long way since 1933 - so the special effects obviously look rather primitive to 21st Century eyes - but anyone with a shred of common sense will still be astounded by what they see. This is movie history in the making. Had this never been made, the whole history of films may have taken a different course.Ace film director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) hires an unemployed, attractive New York woman Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) to star in his new picture. He takes her by boat to remote Skull Island where, according to legend, there lives an awesome god-like beast named Kong. Denham's plan is to shoot a variation of the Beauty and the Beast story, using Ann as his beauty and Kong as his beast. Everyone involved gets more than they bargained for when Ann is kidnapped by the island natives and offered as a sacrifice to Kong. She is kidnapped by a gigantic prehistoric ape and saved only by the courage of ship's mate Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot). But Denham has one more trick up his sleeve when he captures Kong and takes the beast back to New York. You don't really think those chains will hold him, do you?Virtually every monster movie ever made owes something to King Kong - even colossal modern hits like Jurassic Park, The Lost World and Godzilla (not to mention thousands of small scale homages such as The Land Unknown and Gorgo). It is arguably the most influential film of all-time. I genuinely envy people who were lucky enough to experience this film during its 1933 opening week - what must they have thought? Did they realize they were witnessing something utterly extraordinary? I could go on all day giving reasons why you should see it, but it would be pointless. It can all be summed up in one sentence: if you have even the slightest interest in movies SEE THIS FILM!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Extravaganza Still Greatest Movie Adventure of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a guy whose pushing 52, I'm proud to say that this movie has been a profound influence on my life and is largely instrumental into launching me into a career as an art director. I've seen this movie perhaps over 1,000 times. Before the advent of VHS, I would catch it anywhere in L.A. where there was a revival house. Saw it countless times before the "lost" footage was restored (which puts a competely different spin on the complex character of Kong). I have a rare tape recording of the original Steiner "prologue Music" lasting over ten minutes (dubbed for me by a collector friend) which I don't think has made it onto the excellent Turner/Rhino CD soundtrack. And still I see something new upon each screening. I first saw Kong in 1956 on the local "Million Dollar Movie" show, a weekly feature of KHJ TV-9 - an RKO-General station. I remember the scenes of Kong throwing the "wrong" woman to her death as still intact...as well as a few feet of film where a New York fire engine flips-over after going around the corner (I've never seen that bit since). I was in a film class being taught by Rudy Behlmer at Art Center in 1971 when he matter-of-factly screened the "lost" footage in class (he had gotten access to it). I've seen nitrate prints screened at the L.A. County Museum of Art, UCLA and MOMA. I have seen this film with Fay Wray in attendance. I don't think I've ever missed a screening anywhere locally to the best of my knowledge. What bothers me is that today's audiences may not be able to project themselves back into time and try to relive the thrilling film-going experience circa 1933. They cannot grasp or accept the dialogue or style of acting at face-value; many consider it corny...or over-the-top. Yet a comparison between Kong and say Jurassic Park III finds the latter's dialogue so stiltedly puerile and instantly forgettable that it cannot stand the test of time even in the present, let alone seventy years. In Kong, Bruce Cabot portrays a "natural" mug who plays his part beautifully as an uncouth mate aboard ship suddenly sharing his space with one of the prettiest women of all time (Fay Wray's looks are timeless, and she is still a "hottie" even by today's standards) . Is there any wonder that similarities between Cabot and Harrison Ford as "Indiana Jones" are not coincidental? If Cabot were alive today, he'd be the one earning millions. Robert Armstrong is perfect playing an impresario so full of energy he bursts at the seams. This is the way show people talked during the third decade of the Twentieth Century...full of what they used to call ballyhoo (check out Jimmy Cagney in "Footlight Parade made in the same year for the same kind of high-voltage enthusiasm). Frank Reicher is totally believable as the captain, lending an even greater amount of quasi-realism to the fable. Never discussed is fact that this movie is shot almost documentary-style...it has a mythical "preserved-in-amber" feel about it. It's as if what you are seeing is truly real...folklore-become-fact...and that the scenes unfolding actually happened once upon a time in 1933. Who cannot visit New York City today and NOT think of King Kong on the rampage close to 70 years ago? I urge anyone who has not seen "King Kong" on the big screen to do so. When you hear the any of the remarkable sound effects as you view the film, you will become a convert; for example, just listen to the all-too-real crunching of the Allosaurus' jawbone just before Kong ends its life (a death made all-the-more poignant by the way the carnivore is introduced to the audience-by innocently and realistically SCRATCHING ITS HEAD WITH ITS CLAW as it enters frame before the fight). Absolute Perfection in a movie made up of absolute perfections. I could yammer on and on. But I won't. All I can tell you is that for these and countless other reasons this film will always rate a 10-out-of-10. It is still the Greatest Adventure Movie Of All Time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HAPPY BIRTHDAY KING KONG! This month marks the 70th anniversary of the release of the classic 1933 movie King Kong. Produced by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, King Kong is a tragic tale of a giant ape that is taken from his jungle home and put on display in the big city of New York. He escapes while pursuing a girl he has become enamored with and dies a tragic death at the hands of a squadron of Biplanes. Who among us can forget the classic ending line `It was Beauty that killed the beast'. King Kong played to record numbers during its East Coast release in the first week in March 1933(It was released in April on the West Coast). In two theaters in New York the film grossed $89,931 smashing all records. Keep in mind this was during the depression! Many film makers have drawn inspiration from King Kong's tragic tale. Craftsman such as Godzilla director, Ishiro Honda , Ray Harryhausen,( who worked with King Kong effects artist Willis O'Brien on his film MIGHTY JOE YOUNG for which O'Brien won the very first special effects Oscar) andPeter Jackson have claimed to be inspired by Kong's dynamic presence.Willis O'Brien who created the incredible stop motion effects in King Kong tried to create interest in an idea he had been working on that had King Kong battling a creature like Frankenstein only larger. He hoped to make the film by using his stop-motion process to animate both Kong and the Frankenstein monster. He was unable to interest any of the U.S. Studios in his idea so he approached a Japanese studio, Toho, with his concept. The project fell through and Willis O'Brien passed away in 1962 his dream unfulfilled. Shortly after his death, Toho released King Kong vs. Godzilla which featured a story line almost identical to his King Kong vs. Frankenstein script except that the Frankenstein monster was replaced by Godzilla.Little did Cooper and Shoedsack realize what an impact their film would have on the American culture. After the events of 9/11, the internet was bombarded by images of King Kong perched atop the twin towers defending them from the terrorists airplanes. Kong can be found in just about every New York souvenir shop on everything from pens to T -shirts. Todd McFarlane released his own more sinister version of King Kong in his Movie Maniacs line of action figures. Even now Peter Jackson is planning to remake this classic film. King Kong was voted as one of the top 100 Classic American films of all time by the American Film Institute (AFI) and TV Guide named King Kong atop the Empire State Building the Fourth Greatest Movie Moment.Even 70 years later, King Kong continues to enthrall millions of new fans due to the extensive showings on television and video. King Kong has been shown on television more than almost any other film. Surprisingly, King Kong has never been released on DVD in the United States although a brand new DVD is planned for release in 2004 including never before seen footage and enhanced video and audio.Merian C. Cooper said it best-"'Kong' was never intended to be anything but the best damned adventure film ever made, which it is; and that's all it is." Happy Birthday King Kong and thank you keeping the child in all of alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It was Beauty that killed the Beast"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty much sums up the movie, doesn't it? Who hasn't heard of King Kong? This movie is a major part of my childhood, it's one of the first horror films that I ever saw and I couldn't get enough of that giant ape. My mom always laughed at me because this is the first movie that made me cry, I rooted for King Kong all the way, all he wanted was that hot little blonde and to fight dinosaurs. Not too much to ask for. But why is King Kong so great? Why is it still very memorable? Besides the story that was incredibly interesting, the effects are absolutely amazing for it's time. When I was a kid, I seriously thought that they found a giant ape to star in the movie, give me a little credit, you believe anything at 4 years old. But this was the first movie to have tiny figures brought to life on film that were made to look like they were 80 feet tall. King Kong is character of it's own and this film is absolutely wonderful. Carl Denham, a film director who is famous for shooting animal pictures in remote and exotic locations, is unable to hire an actress to star in his newest project and so wanders the streets searching for a suitable girl. He chances upon unemployed Ann Darrow, as she is caught trying to steal an apple. Denham pays off the grocer then buys Ann a meal and offers her the lead role in his latest installment. Although Ann is apprehensive, she has nothing to lose and eagerly agrees. They set sail aboard the Venture, an old tramp steamer that travels for weeks in the direction of Indonesia, where Denham claims they will be shooting. Despite his ongoing declarations that women have no place on board ships, the ship's first mate Jack Driscoll is obviously becoming attracted to Ann. Denham then describes something monstrous connected to the island he's sailing too, a legendary entity known to the islanders as "Kong". Finally arriving at the island's shore, they see a native village perched on a peninsula, cut off from the bulk of the island by an enormous wall. A landing party, including the filmmaker and his leading lady, goes ashore and encounters the natives, who are about to hand over a girl to Kong as a ritual sacrifice. Although Denham, Englehorn, Jack and Ann are hiding behind foliage, the native chief spots them and approaches the troop. Captain Englehorn is able to understand the native speech, and at Denham's urging makes friendly overtures to the chief. When he gets a clear look at Ann, the chief begins speaking with great energy. Englehorn translates this as "look at the golden woman!" The chief proposes to swap six native women for Ann, an offer Denham delicately declines as he and his party edge away from the scene, assuring the chief that they will return tomorrow to get better acquainted. Back on the Venture, Jack and Ann openly express their love for each another. When Jack is called away to the captain's quarters, a stealthy contingent of natives captures Ann, takes her back to the wall and presents her to Kong in an elaborate ceremony. Kong emerges from the jungle and is revealed to be a giant gorilla. The Venture crew returns to the village and takes control of the wall; half of the crew then go after Kong.King Kong was a first of a kind horror movie, it had a story, terrific actors, amazing effects and a wonderful script. Faye Ray was the first actress I really looked up too as a kid, she was absolutely beautiful and such a great screamer, she made me want to lay in a monkey's paw for a while? yes, I also needed to get out more as a child. But hey, you have to admit, if you ever wake up late for work, I'd rather take a giant ape then the bus or car to be caught in rush hour. Anyways, is this movie worth the look? Absolutely, it's a true classic that I guarantee you'll love. It's a great movie and still stands the test of time of making us believe that there are giant apes in third world countries.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy Mackerel, what a show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could never tire of this movie, i've seen it so many times and always watch it when it's on tv-in fact i watched it just a week ago! It's one of those films that is rewatchable countless times, like many other 'monster' movies. But this is the best 'monster' movie , it is so well made-it is a masterpiece. Everything is right-the effects,the photography,the score,pacing,continuity. My favourite part would be the big middle chunk on the island. Ann captured-natives dance-a sacrifice to kong-rescue mission-defeat of stegasoraus-swamp adventure-swamp escape-log catastrophe-trex battle-snake creature fight-pterydactil disposal-rescue/escape-kong wrecks village-gas bomb. There is almost no let up in the action in this sequence. I have seen two versions of the film though. One was cut, the other wasn't. Some scenes that were cut: kong pulls a native out of his hut and stomps him into the mud. Brilliant. Also the bits when kong chews a native, and when he chews on a new yorker. And when he throws a woman down from a scraper into the street. Needless cutting in my book. A lot of people complain about the acting. The acting is swell. Robert Armstrong is perfect as the over enthusiastic director who is completely responsible for the deaths of hundreds of innocent people but has absolutely no scruples about it. He provides the silent chuckles of the movie e.g my one line summary is actually what denham says when he sees the savages and their dancing. And Bruce Cabot to Fay Wray: ' hey, i guess i love you!' in a moment of clarity. Overall a smashing film with a great climax. And kong is supposed to have the hots for fay wray too when he plays with her and her clothes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tongue in cheek movie about Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"He was a king and a god in the world he knew, but now he comes to civilisation merely a captive, a show to gratify your curiosity," the director says to the vaudeville house, before a curtain goes up and we see Kong suspended with his arms nailed out, as if on a cross.Self-reflection and satire of Hollywood is everywhere, which came as a great shock to me. There is a great subtext: the story is about a filmmaker who travels to overseas locations, such as jungles, to film his movies - he cares nothing for the cultures he may be violating, all he cares is capturing the spectacle on film. If he is unable to capture it on film, he tells us early on in the picture, he'll destroy it without a second thought. This is a film about the emptiness and recklessness of Hollywood, yet the satire is not bitter, but tongue-in-cheek in a way that follows James Whale's advice for putting subtexts in genre films, ie, not spoiling it for those viewers who don't "get the joke." So Kong can be enjoyed as a pure genre picture. The performances have false moments, but as an adventure picture it develops well, taking us gradually further towards the mystery of the legend of Kong, then follows Kong as the whole drama of his attempted capture plays out. The music also, is great, and along with mist and good cinematography helps create a mysterious atmosphere. The beginning is fairly talky, but it picks up. And the lovely Fay Wray offers reason enough to watch this on her own. If I was Kong, i know i'd beat the hell out of any dinosaur there was in order to protect her!Luckily, King Kong came in the period between 1930 and 1934 when there was no production code in Hollywood, so content was not censored. A couple years later we wouldn't have had the pleasure of seeing Fay Wray clad in a torn to shreds jungle jane costume, and especially not then falling in the water wearing said outfit! And probably not the degree of violence we have here: in one particular fight Kong has with T-rex he breaks the dinosaur's head by pulling its jaws so far open!The vintage special effects are great. They're so fun for quaintness value, but in places they're actually really good. The wrestling match with the T-rex, when Kong cracks a giant snake's back, and especially when he shakes the men off the log - all these sequences in particular were very well done. When I think about it, these effects aren't as quaint next to today's as you might initially think. How would we do a convincing giant ape onscreen (how will Peter Jackson do it in 2005)? By computer? Most of our completely computerised creatures at this writing are ridiculously fake looking. Try the ridiculous creature in Hulk? Everyone commented on how fake it looked. I'll go for the much more fun stop-motion Hickenlooper Kong over Hulk anyday.And the famous climax in New York City, which ends on the Empire State Building with Kong swatting at planes, is marvellous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scream and Scream Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much has been written about this movie, which has been analyzed more than all but a few films, it's difficult to come up with anything new to say about it but to say that it's magnificently made, and dated as it is in certain respects, it plays as well as anything from seventy years ago, and has a dream logic of its own, which, if one submits to it, still works its charms.A few points:i.) There are no wholly sympathetic characters in the movie. While some people are more likable than others, there's really no one to identify with. Fantastic as the subject matter is, it's filmed almost like a documentary about an adventurer who captures a giant ape, takes it to New York, where it escapes, wreaks havoc in the city, takes down the el as if it were toy, and stomps on a lot of innocent people.ii.) I've never heard more screaming in a movie than in this one. Men, women, children, natives, sailors, white people, dark people, you name it, they scream, often and loudly. Fay Wray is the chief screamer here, but there are plenty of others, such as the man chased up a tree by a dinosaur, and the sailors shaken off the log by Kong, as they fall to a horrifying death in the ravine. When Kong attacks the village there's screaming galore, then more screaming in old Manhattan, when the big guy breaks out of the theater. For his part, Kong does not scream. He roars. The great ape is angry, not terrified, while the people are only afraid.iii.) As one of the chief characters is a documentary film-maker, it's impossible (for me anyway) to avoid making associations between what is going on in the film and the film-making process itself, as I wonder to what extent this entered into the minds of them men who made the movie, Merian Cooper and Ernest Shoedsack. To put it another way, film-maker Carl Denham wants to film the beast to show movie audiences something weird and exotic, so as to tickle their fancy. What he finds is so fantastic that he scraps the idea of making a movie and brings the creature back to civilization and puts it on display. But the beast has fallen in love with a woman, and when he thinks press photographers are hurting her, breaks free from his chains and goes on a rampage through Manhattan. Real life, which was supposed to make a "swell movie", proved so astonishing that it had to be brought back alive, to be shown to people as something that actually exists (i.e. not a thing made up by movie men), but in the process something went wrong, and the great creature went berserk. King Kong is in other words about a movie that didn't get made because life interfered, and proved more fantastic than the film that was abandoned. As such one might call it a cautionary tale (movie men, stick to your job). Or is it about the movies themselves? How, in their attempt to bottle life and sell it back to moviegoers as entertainment, like Kong, they have a way of breaking free and becoming real all over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First King Kong Still Going Strong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the recent DVD release of this film, and the latest version on the big screen being released two days from this writing, I hope more people take the opportunity to check this movie out, the original King Kong, if they've never seen it.This movie must have been astounding to the people watching it over 70 years ago. I doubt they'd ever seen anything like this, action-wise, and monster-wise. It is still fascinating today, even with the great advancements in special effects.Most action films from the classic years, from 1920 to the late 1960s had corny mostly unrealistic special effects but this film still holds up, extraordinarily so considering its age. The film also had a tremendous amount of action. Young people today are usually bored watching old black-and-white movies but they wouldn't be bored with this one. Once the "girl," Fay Wray gets captured by King Kong, the rest of the movie is one long action scene.Kong was not the only beast in the movie, either, which surprised me the first time I ever saw this. Protecting Wray, Kong battles a dinosaur, a giant snake, a giant bird and then human beings firing bullets and bombs at him.Wray also was fun to watch, but I''m a male so a pretty woman like her - shockingly exposing her breasts in one scene, too - makes it easier to enjoy the film. Her screaming, however, can get on your nerves. She must have been hoarse for a month after filming this movie.Robert Armstrong, as the film director, and Bruce Cabot, as the ship crewman and Wray''s rescuer, also are interesting to watch and hear. As I said, once the action kicks in, the his a very entertaining movie and impossible to put down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said?(Possible spoilers, though doubtful) One of the most imaginative, creative, and spectacular action/horror films ever made. It was decades ahead of its time in many ways. It influenced Spielberg, Jackson, you name it; a whole generation of filmmakers. As a kid in pre-Star Wars days, it was breathtaking to watch on TV (a station always showed it every year on Thanksgiving night after Miracle on 34th Street, go figure). Yes, by today's standards, the effects aren't perfect. But HEY! this was about 5 or 6 years after films began talking! Considering it would be some 30 years before effects would come near it, and another 15 or so before they passed it, that is something. Consider today, effects are primarily computerized, and let's not forget, something that looks like a computerized monster is no less fake (something I hope filmmakers figure out, and fast), and that is after 70 years of technological development. And after all that, they are rendered obsolete within a couple years. The fight between Kong and the T-Rex (or allosaurus) can almost stand against effects out there even today. But I digress. I shouldn't have to defend the special effects; those who say they look cheesy need only remember that our greatest triumphs today ? of which there are few ? will be laughed at years from now just the same. The acting is at times tough, but this was the first generation of talking film actors. They had nobody to learn from. Not to mention that it was the acting style of the day. Some have said the movie was about subtle in-jokes, maybe so. But it remains always a film ride that ? unless you are ignorant enough to expect 21st century production values ? will take your breath away. The segment from when the men run into the jungle after Kong up to the break after the T-Rex fight is about as breathtaking as you get. As a child, I was almost exhausted by the time that part was done. The atmosphere, the scale of adventure, the scope of story telling: all first rate. Also, it so wonderfully blended the mindset of the age with its inspired story telling. It was the last era of innocence before WWII and the modern nuclear age. It was a time when little ? though some ? of the world was unexplored. A time when industrialization was taking over, and there seemed no limit to what humanity could accomplish, and no price we were not willing to pay. Dinosaurs and tribal witchdoctors, ancient stone walls and forgotten islands. And on the other side: the Empire State Building (the ultimate expression of industrial might and ingenuity), airplanes (only around for a decade and a half as weapons ? the most 'modern' weapon available), movies (still only a couple decades old for all practical purposes), and New York City, the largest and most advanced city in the world. What contrasts! And all right at hand for the writers. In short, it made its point without having to make it obvious. It will be a long time before there are so many symbols at hand for a new story to fall into place so smoothly. And of course, the iconic image of Kong on the Empire State Building ? enough said.One other observation. Note that there isn't much overt morality. Nobody is really 'the bad guy'(and thus deserving of a terrible, gruesome death). The sailors killed are not 'bad' , or made bad for (horror of horrors) suggesting that they shoot at Kong first, or even daring to consider killing a helpless 50 foot gorilla. Carl Denham is not 'bad', the natives on the island are not 'bad', the victims in New York aren't bad, even Kong isn't bad, he's just doing his thing. Everyone is just doing their thing, sometimes good, sometimes bad, but never inherently bad people or animals. Today, of course, you would have the stereotypical lawyer/corporate exec/fanatic politician/religious extremist/merciless hunter; all who deserve death, because they are 'bad people' because of their ideals or beliefs (the modern acceptable prejudice). Kong would be misunderstood, a victim of horrible western heartlessness or corporate greed, and those who die deserve it for messing with his life and the purity of nature. And the soon-to-be-deceased would meet their deserved demise after a scene demonstrating their evil hearts by doing and/or saying something blatant to drive the point of their badness home to any that might have missed it. Ah, but the good old days, when a film could actually make you wonder who the bad guy really is, and if there isn't, make you wonder even more about what you have seen and why things had to happen that way.King Kong is considered a classic. It earned it. The remake in the 1970s, flagrant in its moral sermonizing, struggled at best. Who knows, maybe Peter Jackson will navigate modern expectations with the elements of the original to produce a remake worthy of the first without turning it into a floppy CGI based morality play. Let's hope. But in all of its glory or bumbling, whichever the case will prove, let the 2005 remake never overshadow the original and its unique impression it left for generations to come. I give it a 10 only because there is not a higher score to assign.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame that young people these days, don't know how to enjoy a black &amp; white movie! I'm 14, and I love black &amp; white movies. We saw this movie at school, and everyone hated it. They said it sucked, because it was in black &amp; white, and the effects were hilariously bad!I disagreed! This movie is nearly 80 years old, and it's still a hit!The cinematography is incredibly beautiful. One of the greatest shots of all time is when Kong is on the top of the building! The acting is fine.The story is great, but my friends found it stupid. They thought it was unrealistic because there were dinosaurs and a giant gorilla on the island etc. This movie is entertaining throughout the whole movie! Most black &amp; whites movies got a lot of dialog and long scenes with no editing, but not in this one! There are plenty of scenes in this movie where there are no dialog, but great editing and entertainment! The effects are so fantastic! Young people may find Kong hilarious when they see a close-up picture of him. But I was absolutely blown away! Imagine that you're in 1933. You go to the movies and you've never seen something like this before!King Kong is a one small step for man. One giant leap for film making!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Escape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released at the height of the Great Depression, "King Kong" was the ultimate great escape for audiences. Its greatest legacy is that over seventy years later, it still has that uncanny ability to completely transport the viewer into its fantasy world. This amazing adventure film is still one of the most viscerally exciting spectacles ever made and changed the course of movie history.The stop-motion animation was the most amazing special effects of its day and still hold up pretty well. The amazing sense of spectacle they created have inspired some of the greatest filmmakers of their generations. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron, and Peter Jackson wouldn't have been inspired to make the films they made had Kong not brilliantly paved the way.Aside from the technical innovations, you have a great music score from Max Steiner (who later scored "Gone With the Wind") that created the template for what movie scoring could do. He paved the way for the likes of John Williams and James Horner. Movie music, too, could be an art, and Steiner was the first to realize that with "King Kong."Finally, you have the story, which is so much more than just a B-movie serial. It's amazing to find a special effects film that works on so many complex levels aside from the visuals. On one level this a innovative riff on the classic "Beauty and Beast" story with screen legend Fay Wray pitch perfect as actress Ann Darrow, the object of Kong's unrequited affections. On another level, this is gentle satire on movie making, with the reckless actions and sense of adventure and spectacle of director Carl Denham mirroring the real life adventures and desires of Kong's producer and co-director, the mythic-sized Merrion C. Cooper. Still, on a third level, this can be seen as a fable about the greatest jungle of them all, modern civilization, brilliantly realized through New York City. Not many films of this nature could be so rich.This iconic classic was "modernized" egregiously in 1976, and redone as a loving, period-piece homage in 2005.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gods and monsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forty years before Raquel Welsh, and a whole era before 'Jurassic Park', 'King Kong' was the world's first dinosaur movie. But it wasn't the dinosaurs it featured, but rather the eponymous giant ape, who became perhaps cinema's most enduring icon. The recent death of Fay Wray, the film's star, provides a good opportunity to re-evaluate this classic movie. The most remarkable thing is how exactly this film, made when talkies themselves were less than a decade old, defines the blockbuster to this day. All the elements are there: a ludicrous plot (among the many improbables we have to swallow is the fact that the discovery of living tyranousauri is regarded unremarkable by all); bad acting; a quasi-racist world-view, non-stop action tempered by a little love interest; and stunning special effects. The plot has a surprisingly mature structure, though, and unlike most of its successors, thankfully does not see the need for pyrotechnics right at the start, instead allowing the tension to build before the monster's first appearance. The scene composition is also frequently truly brilliant, especially the scenes of Kong in New York, and also the scene where he bursts through the gates. It's also interesting to catch certain cinematic conventions in an early state of evolution: one is that if characters are shot from a distance, we hear their voices more quietly. Also of note is the very static camera, pre-dating Orson Welles, of course, but additionally constrained by the need to accommodate the special effects: the scenes with the monster do feel more like a silent movie, or a primitive video game (indeed, the first computer game I ever owned was inspired by this movie, which, owing to a surreal Japanese spelling error, was known as 'Donkey Kong'!). 'King Kong' is certainly no donkey of a film; but in some ways it's a little disappointing to see how little the action adventure movie has advanced from its template in 71 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this a couple of days after Peter Jackson's KING KONG hit the cinemas . I had planned to go to the cinema to see the new version but just found out that it lasted for three hours which is far too long for someone who's addicted to caffeine and nicotine . I much prefer watching a movie with a cup of tea in one hand and a filthy cigarette in the other . Which reminds me that my new year resolution is to give up smoking . Sorry I digress Perhaps the other thing stopping me is a fear of disappointment . I do confess I was disappointed after seeing THE TWO TOWERS at the cinema probably because I loved FELLOWSHIP so much , a film I didn't really expect much from . You see the original KING KONG is regarded as possibly the greatest monster movie ever made and after seeing it again I can see where it got its reputation from . This is a great Hollywood epic One thing you must do however is ignore the failings of special effects from a modern day perspective . Yes we know that the title monster is a giant puppet , yes we know those dinosaurs are bloody laughable but that's not what you should be looking at . What makes the movie so enjoyable is the strength of the storytelling , the emotional depth and most important of all the imagination involved , it has a true sense of scale and wonder . I really hated the 1976 remake simply because it featured no giant reptiles on Skull Island ( Though there's other reasons to hate the dire remake too ) and you might bite your lip to stop yourself laughing as the expedition are attacked by a whole host of prehistoric monsters but you've got to admit it's very , very enjoyable as are the scenes in New York at the end</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To sleep, perchance to dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been compared to a dream quite a bit over the years; I didn't know if I could add to that. But reading some of the reviews here, especially from younger writers, it occurred to me that maybe the problem here is that with the arrival of a totalitarian television culture, cheap imitation computer games and gaudy CGI special effects,and with an economy that offers little more than nightmare for the future, perhaps the fascination with dreams that this film evokes for us has itself become out-of-date. Perhaps the age of human dreaming is over.How vivid are our dreams? How vivid are they when we're not sure what we're dreaming about? I've seen mint-condition prints of this film, and I've seen scratchy gray television prints; surprisingly, the effect is always the same. In fact, it's been ten years since I saw this film last, and as I write, the images appear to me as a stronger memory than anything I actually lived through.The images are dark, and a bit murky in spots - so are my dreams. The torches of the natives on Skull Island flicker as stars that have fallen to earth. Fay Wray hangs on threads from the posts like an angel with clipped wings. Suddenly, the music stops (and I didn't even notice it playing); then the thunder beats through the jungle's permanent night, except the beating isn't thunder, it's footsteps, and the foliage begins to shake, not from wind, but from the quake of an earth suddenly off its axis - yet no earth could ever be as solid and immovable as this island, for there are no other planets, no other earth but this island - unknowable, dense, impossibly claustrophobic. Then the jungle parts the dark exploding in the dark, and a primal force, vaguely simian, fills the night, extinguishing stars, and Wray's weirdly whisper-like scream still pierces the air, before a dark hand reaches for her....Kong breathes; no special fx creature seems able to do that, anymore. Kong's fur ripples along the taut lines of his muscles - no fx beast has demonstrated this since. Kong moves more swiftly than any of his offspring; Kong's eyes radiate a pre-rational intelligence; Kong's fury is passionate and implacable.I've never had any doubt as to who Kong really is: he is everything human still inarticulate, set free to dream in perpetual sleep.His death is swift - painfully realistic - exactly as one wakes to daylight.'Twas not beauty killed the beast; rather, the beast is beautiful, and so it must die. Only in dreams can beauty live eternal. But humans are not immortal; everything beautiful passes, and every dream must have its end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the Eighth Wonder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be pointless to pretend that this film hasn't aged at all. In just about every respect it shows its years; the special effects, the acting, the dialogue. And yet "King Kong" is a film which definitely survives the passage of time. It is simply above the sort of criticism that applies to most movies.It would be wrong to think of "King Kong" as camp or quaint. It packs a lot of primordial energy into its 100 minutes. What it has in abundance is heart, an element that every sequel, remake and spinoff has pretty much lacked. The richly textured visuals are truly unsurpassed - the nightmare of Kong's island always reminds me of one of Goya's more opulent fantasies. Visually "King Kong" is a true masterpiece.At the risk of a lynching, I feel I should point out that "King Kong" offers one of Fay Wray's lesser performances. This very sympathetic actress has been justly rediscovered by later generations; in her own time I suspect she was rather taken for granted. "King Kong" is responsible for this reappraisal, and she is certainly very appealing and rises to the (not very high) demands of the role. But if you really want to see her at her best, take a look at Von Stroheim's "The Wedding March" or Walsh's "The Bowery". She could do more than scream - though "Kong" proves that she could do that magnificently."King Kong" is a true masterpiece, and I have to laugh at those who imply racist overtones. Clearly there was no such intent on the part of the producers, and I'm very hard pressed to see them even when they have been pointed out. I must have seen this film hundreds of times, and I always look forward to seeing it again. To quote Carl Denham, "Holy Mackerel! What a show!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing has become an icon of vernacular culture. A decade or so ago an artist arranged to have a huge balloon of King Kong blown up and attached to the top of the Empire State Building. It didn't work. The consarned thing kept deflating and flapping around in the unanticipated wind.No matter. The image of Kong beating his chest, stripping off Fay Wray's clothes, fighting the Tyrannosaurus, shaking the men off the log into the spider pit, and finally being killed by those damned planes will survive Cristo's -- or anybody else's -- attempt to turn Kong into a work of art.Mainly, it's a work of technology. It was, to say the least, a labor-intensive project under people like Willis O'Brien, Meriam C. Cooper, and Ernest Shoedsack.What gets me about it is that it's so much more than that. King Kong, who was no more than a fourteen-inch puppet, let's face facts, was turned into a genuine actor. Look at his facial expressions. When he's enraged he LOOKS enraged. When he's sad, he looks sad. Now, those are easy expressions to form on a plastic, sculpted face. Blind people have sculpted accurate impressions of emotions like "rage" or "fear", not to mention Edvard Munch, who was nuts. But "puzzlement"? Check out Kong's expression when he's been seriously wounded by the constant shooting of the nasty airplanes and he picks at his wounds and looks at the blood on his fingertips. We sense that the animal is perfectly comfortable with fighting dinosaurs but has no idea of what he's now dealing with.I'm telling you, when he fell from the building to the ground I cried. I cried like a baby. By the way, when Fay Wray surfaces after the long plunge into the water, her garments slip off her shoulder and you can see what she's got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kong Is Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong (1933)I had been anticipating viewing this for a long time. Back in '05 when Peter Jackson's remake came out I went to the theatre to see it and really enjoyed it. The story was awesome, the setting was really amazing, and the CGI "Kong" was incredible. It wasn't until a few years later when I had wanted to see the original King Kong. I looked all over for it and once I finally had a copy of it (the original black and white, not the colorized version) I was ready for it...And personally, I think it blew the 2005 remake out of the water, no comparison. Of course, the original lacked a lot of the remake's special effects and vivid colors and whatnot, but that was to be much expected.But I really loved it. It was amazing to see how they pulled that off back in the 30s. The acting was fantastic, the camera direction was superb, and I was mesmerized by the scenery. Everyone should at least see this classic once in their lifetime. I know I plan on watching it again very soon...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most significant movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This amazingly large film, is definitely one of the biggest movies ever made, even in his genre, a mixture of adventure, fantasy, SF and horror. The movie that set some new standards that were used over and over, most importantly - the meaning of a true blockbuster adventure. This film was one of the first mega hit blockbusters at big budget and high gross (for that time). Directed by Ernest Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper, these two guys were credited for creating a large ape adventure. The story was really something new back then, a little bit with that "beauty and the best" element, which goes pretty good here. A director Carl Denham (played by great Robert Armstorng, who created a very lively, charismatic and enthusiastic, original version of Carl Denham) and his film crew travels on a isolated island where they stumble upon a giant ape that takes away their leading actress Ann Darrow (played by lovely Fay Wray. Alas Fay got stuck forever with that role, and most of the time, she played scream queens, but, she did a terrific job here, and that only matters), only to capture the ape and brought him to New York (an excellent ground for one of the most thrilling endings in the history of cinema).Now, the story was written by Edgard Wallace, whose idea about giant ape was really astonishing, in that period, in movies before the Second world war, he created a modern story idea about the beauty and the beast. Wallace put a rational amount of melodrama in the film, because without it, it would be just another mindless film featuring a large monster, only with cool special effects. And the special effects were amazing for that time, no wonder that filming took almost two years, it was a lot of work to do, and really, I enjoy these stop-motion effects more than today's CGI. Nevertheless, this "dimension" of Kong's which makes him more closely to human, just because he fells in love with the leading lady, makes the plot better and it determined a pattern which will be used in later films. It is interesting that, the same year, The Son of Kong (1933) was filmed and released with even higher melodrama.So, the cinematography (for that time), make up, filming locations and others were pretty amazing, everything is pretty amazing, to mention the musical score of one of the old master movie composers Max Steiner, who made a badass score. We also have an old manly, heroic element depicted in John Driscoll (played by Bruce Cabot), who saves Ann from the clutches of the large beast. To also mention a fact that Kong is not alone in the island, there were tribes that worships Kong as a God, but that tribe looked little silly... and also - dinosaurs. That's right, there were bunch of dinosaurs, also large insects who pumped action and adventure even more, and don't even let me start talking about the brilliant duel between Kong and T.Rex... now that was amazing! Earnest Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper were big fans of wrestling and they directed the fighting choreography between two beasts. That's professional, even with stop-motion special effects.If you haven't seen this film, not even the two remakes... see the 1933 first, than proceed to the other, please don't watch remakes, you'll ruin the impression. Watch it and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CG or stop motion?? I prefer the latter!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: I admit. This is a terribly biased review as I hate CG animations and I'm a huge fan of the original 1933 KING KONG. Read on if you dare...Storyline: The disreputable Carl Denham (Jack Black) and his film crew travel to the unexplored Skull Island to shoot a movie starring the beautiful Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) as leading lady. On the island the film crew encounter first a tribe of primitive cannibals and the giant ape Kong who falls in love with Ann Darrow. They use Ann Darrow as bait to catch Kong and transport him back to New York. But all hell breaks lose in New York when Kong escapes from a presentation show to seek out his beloved Ann Darrow...Since I first heard Peter Jackson was remaking KING KONG I had been anxious to see what the New Zealandish director of infamous low budget/no budget horror movies such as BAD TASTE and BRAINDEAD, the funny mockumentary FORGOTTEN SILVER, and the overrated LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy had done with the perhaps biggest monster icon in the history of cinema. Remaking such huge cinematic milestones is always near-impossible. Many people have nostalgic memories of the giant ape, and therefore everybody will have opinions.Surprise, surprise - the movie was actually good! And much better than the 1976 and 1986 versions. Most impressive are the CG special effects. For example: the fast-paced "Kong vs. dinosaur(s)" scenes or the small details on Kong's body. His hair. His eyes. And his realistic movements. Andrew Lesnie's cinematography looks stunning, and the movie is generally full of stunning backgrounds and set designs. Secondly Jack Black nails the Carl Denham character by never overdoing the sentimentality or comedy, unlike fellow comedic actors Robbin Williams and Jim Carrey. Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody, along with the rest of the person gallery, struggle to give their clich cardboard characters life, but that doesn't matter too much, because in reality this movie is all about Kong. Thematically it deals with impossible relationship among uneven sizes.But, aside from being an hour too long, I have another more fundamental, yet highly subjective, problem with Peter Jackson's KING KONG. This is where the inevitable subjective and nostalgic criticism comes in: I want stop motion animations and not CG animations! Although Kong looks better than ever CG is just too slick and, in lack of a better word, "undemanding" for me. Admittedly the 1933 KING KONG looks laughable compared to today's standards, but one can only imagine the impact the stop motion technique must have had on its audience in the early 30's. To me stop motion just has a certain unique visual quality that CG will never be to deliver. Nowadays CG easily handles anything, while in 'dem good ol' days it had to be done manually. And the result just came out more cinematic. I enjoy looking at Kong 2005, but when the initial wow-effect has worn off I find Kong 1933 more exciting to look at. As with all good film elements it's hard to pinpoint the exact quality of stop motion, but it has something to do with visual poetry (to use German director Werner Herzog's expression). The CG is so overdone and slick that it gives you all the answers, and doesn't leave room for the imagination. Stop motion looks more strange, terrible, mysterious, funny, and... poetic!I welcome CG animations to the world of cinema, but only when used rightfully. Hollywood shouldn't forgot to reflect on what qualities they neglect by always taking the easy route. If you want a modern Hollywood action popcorn blockbuster then Peter Jackson's KING KONG is a fine choice, but I highly recommend that you seek out the 1933 version to see what they accomplished back then. Judge for yourself which one is superior. Remember to get the original black/white version, and not the colorized version. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what the hell that last reviewer was talking about. KING KONG creator Merian C. Cooper even stated that his movie was going to be nothing more than an adventure / surrealistic fantasy movie. Politics? Give me a break! Those who criticize this movie (and there have been many lately, mostly due to the fact that Peter Jackson is going to remake it, and some are only now discovering the original), have absolutely no idea of the who's, how's and why's of the original. Try reading the book THE MAKING OF KING KONG to get a better idea or just finding info on the Net. There's plenty out there.In terms of story and special effects, KING KONG is still a timeless classic. No creature before or since (even CGI renditions) can match Kong's personality that Willis O'Brien put into him. And KING KONG is an important movie. The world of special effects films (including many today that spoiled fanboys seem to love while at the same time putting down this movie) would NOT be the same had this been never made. Kudos to Merian C. Cooper, Willis O'Brien and many, many others for their contribution to the world of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Eighth Wonder of the Word in the Seventh Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1933, the bold and successful filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) travels by ship with a large crew, his friend Jack Driscoll and the starlet Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) to an unknown island to shoot a movie. The local natives worship a huge gorilla called Kong and they abduct Ann to offer her in a sacrifice to Kong. Jack Driscoll, who is in love with her, Carl Denham, who aims to capture the animal for an exhibition in New York and part of the crew hike into the jungle, where dinosaurs live, trying to rescue Ann. King Kong falls in love for Ann and protects her against the dangers. But the gorilla is captured and brought to New York. In the middle of a show in Broadway, King Kong escapes, bringing panic to the Apple city.Two days ago I saw Peter Jackson's unnecessary remake of this masterpiece, and to recover my love for cinema, I decided to watch again the original version. "King Kong" is a fantastic movie, with a spectacular story with action, adventure, fantasy, horror, sci-fi and thriller; the special effects are amazing for a 1933 movie, with very few resources and equipment; and the use of sound, a few years after the silent period, and the powerful screams of Fay Wray, are awesome. I do not know the intention of Peter Jackson, but he was absolutely pretentious expecting to remake such a wonder. People who love the Seventh Art will certainly prefer this version, no matter how young he or she may be. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "King Kong"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this from beginning to end last night (after having seen only portions of the film before), and while I was entertained and found the film had a quaint sort of charm and beauty in the jungle scenes especially, I couldn't help thinking that if ever a classic film deserved a remake with greater special effects, this was it. Modern audiences have since been treated to the wonders of JURASSIC PARK and other amazing epics which make the effects in KONG seem totally primitive from beginning to end.The screenplay is full of clichs and some of the dialog is absolutely laughable. (Bruce Cabot, awkwardly admitting to Fay Wray, "Er...I think I love you.") And the story is a strictly comic book adventure into which the producers put an awful lot of hard work and detail to bring the story to life. And they do bring it to life because once the camera crew lands at Skull Island, the events flow smoothly and the most entertaining part of the tale begins.FAY WRAY is the ultimate damsel in distress with a scream that forced me to turn the sound down every once in awhile lest neighbors think I was murdering someone. She is very fetching to look at and it's understandable why she became a golden trophy for Kong. Her acting, by 1930s standards, is acceptable too when she isn't screaming.BRUCE CABOT, by contrast, comes off rather poorly in the acting department. He became a much stronger film presence later on in the '30s, usually as the heel who makes things difficult for the leading man. His acting, as the hero who falls for Wray, is stiff and a bit uncomfortable to watch.ROBERT ARMSTRONG is enthusiastic as the filmmaker who wants to make the greatest epic ever and takes his adventurous crew to a remote island where he's heard the legend of Kong. There is the stamp of authority in his take on the role but also a bit of the ham.The effects for Kong are surprisingly good, considering when this film was made no computer animation was possible. All of his movements are well animated (if a bit jerky), and his antics provide much of the excitement for the viewers.I had to remind myself that I was watching a film made more than seventy years ago--and with that in mind, one can understand why this was such an achievement at the time of release. Taken in that context, it's still quite an enjoyable experience. The log rolling sequence, the train disaster, the flight through the jungle and the many "victim" scenes, are worth watching and waiting for.However, today's technology can make the Kong story much more compelling and I'm eager to see what Peter Jackson has done with the new Kong.About the score:Max Steiner's famous score is not one of my favorites. Perhaps at fault is the primitive sound recording of his music which doesn't do justice to the full orchestral treatments which sound tinny at times. The melodic content featured in most of his scores is scarce here. However, it's worthy noting that this is one of those rare films from the '30s where much of the movie is actually accompanied by music. As such, this was an important step forward in the history of film music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only one KING KONG reigns supreme!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid many decades ago, older people talked about some great movie THEY'D seen as kids with a giant ape and dinosaurs. In 1950, RKO was sold and the new owners re-released KING KONG, the first movie ever promoted with massive advertising on television. KING KONG was the dream project of Merian Cooper, John Ford, David Selznick and other great pioneer filmmakers who fought tooth-n-nail to bring it to the screen. It was their baby, and they did everything right. When it opened in 1933 at first run theaters, it was the only movie to ever play at both the largest theaters in the world, Radio City Music Hall, and one block away at the Roxy, the Cathedral of Motion Pictures, each with 6,000+ seats and giant screens --- compared to today's typical multiplex of 150 to 400 seats. I've seen this movie at least 40 times now. It never grows old because true classics never do. Re-made in 1976 with no dinosaurs and no entertainment value, that film is remembered only with contempt. Now along comes Peter Jackson, the king of excess, spending "an all time record" with his alleged remake. WHY? The first movie was made for about $400,000; perhaps equal to $4 million in today's dollars. Everything was made perfect with that tight budget. How Jackson manages to squander more money on KONG than Warners wasted on TROY remains a mystery. Classic movies do not emerge from excess spending but rather from challenge and dedication. Original ideas are essential to classics; copycat ideas do not. I expect a fast playoff for the new KING KONG, a faded memory by mid-2006. When KING KONG opened in New York in 1933, the exact admission prices were 35 cents till 1 PM; 55 cents till 5 PM; and 75 cents evenings. This compares to $10.50 for all movies all day in NYC in 2005. In 1933, a $400 annual salary was a comfortable middle class income. Almost all other cities had lower movie prices in 1933, and the US population was a fraction of what it is today. When the "new" version is released, look for king sized bragging about box office gross, but don't be fooled. The list of "All Time Movie Hits" is NEVER adjusted for inflation. Thus even big-time hits like JAWS and STAR WARS (both released when top movie prices were $3.00) are always bounced down the list by the mere fact of the $9.25 to $10.50 prices of 2005.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make 'em like this anymore!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Sergeant in the Army and a few days ago when I was home on Christmas leave, I happened to catch the remake of King Kong on the American Movie Classics Channel (I am talking about the 1976 version with Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges). Maybe it shows how bored I was that I even watched it. I couldn't believe they showed it on a "classic" channel. The 1933 version is head and shoulders above it and any other "Jurassic Park" movie that they make today. In fact, any movie with special effects like JP or The Terminator or Titanic in a sense goes back to King Kong. All the filmakers today like Spielberg and Cameron in a sense need to "tip their hats" to Willis O'Brien and Merian C. Cooper for their immense contribution to film. People talk about how the 1976 version had better special effects (the 1933 Kong looks very jerky by today's standards), but people wake up you are missing the point. Glossy pyrotechnics, big budgets and flashy special effects don't make a film great not by a long shot! These wonderful classic films have an "intangible" in them that makes them great a spirit that just reaches out and grabs your soul. Sometimes I think it would be wonderful to go back in time to 1933 when KK was first released during the Great Depression. I can imagine how the audience must have gasped and screamed when Kong first appeared or when he fought those dinasours to save Fay Wray (he fought a T Rex, a big snake and a pterodactyl in this film in the remake he only fought a big snake). Someone once said that Bruce Cabot's character was like Indiana Jones and I was cheering for him all the way when he saved Ann. Fay Wray was a magnificent actress and a beautiful woman. I mean these actresses today are homely compared to her (well except for Cameron Diaz). Her career never really took off the way it should have after KK. In fact she retired several times and ended her career doing tv guest shots. She made a wonderful heroine in the film and I'll always remember Robert Armstrong's last line, its a classic, "It was beauty who killed the beast". Fay Wray is still living today, she is almost a century old. I wrote to Ms. Wray several years ago and she sent me an autograph I will always treasure. They often define a movie classic as one that has "stood the test of time". King Kong is that classic and no one has ever done it better. I am angry that they are actually making another remake that is going to be coming out on Christmas 2005. They are damn fools to even try, didn't they learn their lesson from 1976! By the way, they have done several restorations on KK where cut scenes were restored, but there was one cut scene that has never been found. Its where Kong attacks those sailors and shakes them off the log bridge. In the original they fall into a ravine and are devoured by giant spiders. This was shown to a preview audience and their reaction was so negative that O'Brien and Cooper immediately cut out that scene. Just something for you trivia lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this classic movie on TCM made us realize, and admire, the tremendous achievement those early filmmakers gave us in "King Kong", a film that will live forever. Merian Cooper and Ernest Shoedsack set the pace, and the style, for this highly satisfying motion picture that looks as fresh today as when it made its debut in 1933."King Kong" was a movie that dazzled those first movie goers by its audacity and the use of the amazing visual effects that, for the era, were ground breaking. The musical score by that genius, Max Steiner, holds the picture together and gives it another dimension in the way one responds to it.No matter how many remakes this film will undergo, this is the real thing! Make no mistakes about it.The best thing in the film are the three principals, Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong, and Bruce Cabot who will live forever as long as the film is shown.A heartfelt thanks for Merian Cooper and Ernest Shoedsack for producing an amazing movie that has conquered the imagination of movie fans through the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It was beauty killed the beast."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a handful of movies, my favorites, that I watch annually - the original "King Kong" is one of them. My timing this year is appropriately planned, the Peter Jackson remake is just a few weeks away. Generally, it's almost impossible to surpass the original of any title, but I'll keep an open mind. In the mean time, I'm still in awe of the cinematography, effects and story line of this 1933 classic.Right from the opening line - "Say, is this the moving picture ship?" - you know something special is about to happen. Promoter Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) is embarking on a fantastic voyage, and as the viewer tags along, all concerned are about to undergo a harrowing and exciting adventure. His discovery, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) exudes a likable shyness along with her understated good looks, and if she has any reservations about Denham's offer to star in his movie, it's quickly replaced by the action, adventure and romance on the voyage to the mythical Skull Island. It's not on any of the navigation charts, but it's the perfect destination for Denham's recklessness and secrecy. "Did you ever hear of...Kong?" Considering that the film was made over seventy years ago, I'm constantly amazed at the technical wizardry and attention to detail employed for what could have been just another monster movie. And make no mistake, this is the quintessential monster film. Once Kong makes his grand entrance to abduct the "golden woman", a host of prehistoric beasts appear in rapid succession in grand stop motion photography. We're treated to a stegosaurus, brontosaurus, tyrannosaurus rex, a huge snake like lizard, and a pterodactyl, all supplying varying degrees of menace to Kong and humans alike. What's fascinating though, is the intricacy of the scenes, the predatory wagging of the T-Rex tail as he does battle with Kong, the flow of blood from the dead beast's head, the appearance of the scavenging prehistoric vulture feasting on the body. And it's not just the visual, the sound of the cracking jaw when King Kong defeats his enemy is raw and guttural, complementing a truly visceral confrontation.Kong's brief brush with the island natives after forcing his way through the wooden barricade is also remarkable for it's brutality. More than once, Kong is shown chomping on unlucky victims, while others are shown summarily trampled underfoot in the soft island mud. It's a fitting preview for the destruction in New York, where Kong's new enemies are photographers, trains and aerial dive bombers. Who can forget the pathos in the creature's face as he nurses his gunshot wounds, about to fall to his death from the Empire State Building? The movie ends as it began, paying homage to an ancient Arabian proverb - "It was beauty killed the beast".If you pay close attention, you'll be able to pick out the differences between the full body Kong and the separately constructed head and face used for close up shots. The full size Kong, an eighteen inch puppet, has a head that tapers more or less to an upward point, with a ridge line above the eyes. The close-up Kong's face is rounder and squatter, with those unmistakable canines ready to do business."King Kong" would go on to create an entire genre of big ape movies, including it's own spin off, "The Son of Kong", also featuring Robert Armstrong reprising his Denham character. Quite a few years later, Armstrong appeared in "Mighty Joe Young", whose title character was a much more "normal" sized gorilla. The 1940's and 50's were ripe with "B" grade fare dealing with gorilla and ape themes, but by then it was usually a man in a monkey suit doing the honors. But they all owe it to the king of movie monsters - "King Kong".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic adventure film about film director Carl Denham(played by Robert Armstrong) headed to Skull Island on a ship under the command of Captain Englehorn(played by Frank Reicher) and his first mate Robert Driscoll(played by Bruce Cabot). Key to the picture is Ann Darrow(played by Fay Wray) who will find herself the unwilling center of attention from both the hostile native tribe and the "god" they worship: a giant ape called King Kong. After Ann is abducted, the crew pursue her into the jungle, where most of them die fighting dinosaurs and Kong, who is knocked unconscious and taken to New York, where he will escape and climb the Empire State Building in a legendary climax.Absolutely grand adventure film holds up beautifully today, and is quite exciting and harrowing. Sure, you could nitpick certain plot holes, but why bother in this near-perfect escapist entertainment. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Sparked The Imagination of Many Storytellers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one film that sticks out in my mind as a true classic, it's undeniably King Kong. This flick stands high on my list of favorite films and it's imaginative storytelling, revolutionary special effects and iconic imagery have sparked the imagination of many people who would go onto change the world of pop culture forever. Ray Harryhausen saw the film at a young age and it's groundbreaking effects inspired him to bring his legendary creatures of mythology and lore to life. Peter Jackson saw the film at a young age and it inspired him to be a film maker, eventually remaking the film in 2005. And a little known Japanese man named Shigeru Miyamoto took several elements from King Kong, reimagined them and made one of the most iconic video games of all time, introducing a certain Italian plumber to the world. But why do I like the film? Well, it's just plain out iconic. The images of Kong, the Skull Island natives and the Empire State Building have been burnt into my noggin for all time and it's just incredible what Merian C. Cooper, Willis O'Brien and the rest of the crew were able to accomplish back in 1933, 80 years ago! Some of the filming techniques were invented right as the film was being made and how they were able to bring Kong to life is a remarkable story. Sometimes, shots of the live action actors would have to be shot frame by frame as Kong was being animated. Sometimes, when Kong was picking up people and putting them in his mouth, it would be a life-sized, motorized Kong head and hand. Sometimes, the stop motion footage would have to be composited together with the live action footage to make the scene become whole. It was a tedious, time consuming process and the fact that everyone was able to pull it off in the end is really remarkable. Somebody should have given these guys medals! The story is also legendary. The story of King Kong parallels that of Beauty and the Beast where a gruff, monstrous entity risks his life for the woman he loves. Of course, in the 1976 version and the 2005 version, the relationship between Anne Darrow and Kong is much more drawn out, but in the 1933 version, Kong's just a normal ape who falls in love with a girl who was originally supposed to be sacrificed to him. Anne Darrow, portrayed by Fay Wray comes off as a screaming bimbo who doesn't really do anything to make Kong like her. Every time he comes around and picks her up, all she does is scream bloody murder. It's no wonder why some considered Wray a "scream queen". But then again, she is a pretty individual and we don't want to see her in any kind of peril. She's just your typical damsel in distress, something drastically changed about her character in later adaptations. The other characters are fine too, and Anne's love interest is a likely goofball who doesn't seem to admire her at first but comes to admire her as the film unfolds. Kong is just an incredibly sight. Every time I see him, a get a good snicker out of him. He's just a normal, wild ape who acts out of instinct and at times doesn't know what to do with himself. But the scene where he's strapped down for all the citizens of New York to see and he gives off that cheesy grin, I just get a funny feeling inside. Maybe Kong is more human than we originally thought. He's willing to do anything to protect Anne and when he climbs the Empire State Building, he's attempting to fight off the planes solely to protect her from any harm. It goes to show that any animal, even animals of extreme height and weigh have emotions and in their own ways, motivations. This of course was elaborated on in the various remakes, but I think the original gets the point across more. Kong may seem like a threat to the citizens of New York, but deep down, he's just a creature with love in his heart and a determination to protect the one he loves, even if the humans don't see it. Why else would he break the jaw of the T-Rex. Why else would he take down a bloodthirsty pterodactyl. All these elements make his death at the end much more compelling. But I've gone on long enough. This is by far one of the greatest motion pictures ever conceived. And I'm quite positive that everyone has different reasons why they like the movie and consider it a classic, for it has a lot to offer in the storytelling and the visual department. Whatever reason you like the movie, I'm quite certain this film will delight, enchant and mesmerize many generations of movie watchers to come. It's an 80 year old movie that will certainly go on for another 80 years and another 80 after that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And now ladies and gentleman, before I tell you any more, I am about to show you the greatest thing your eyes have ever beheld. He was a king and a god in the world he knew, but now he comes to civilization merely a captive. A show to gratify your curiosity. Ladies and gentleman, look at Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World!This may be one of the most famous movie quotes from one of the most famed movie ever. When I first saw King Kong from 1933, I was amazed by its realness of the movie from 80 years previously. Fay Wray, playing Ann Darrow, the blonde beauty, did a marvelous job. Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot did a great job, also. Peter Jackson's 2005 remake isn't half bad, either. This was also probably the most gory and violent movies of its time. Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack did a wonderful job with the stop action animation and directing. As Ann Darrow and Carl Denham and the the crew go to Skull Island on their movie making voyage, you are instantly captivated by the nature and culture of the native peoples. However, the only thing I don't like about this movie is that it is too short. You may disagree a little, but this is MY review.Do I think this is a movie worth watching if you haven't seen it already? Definitely.</fullReview>

But "when monkey die, people cry" to paraphrase a another Shlockmeister. The first of the giant monster films where Nature attempts to overwhelm the upstart Humans and loses. We are all sad to see the past die. To take away innocent memories of our youth. To destroy the Wonder of Creation that begat the seed of our dreams. The Ninth sentence!

		<shortDescription>Excellent Stop Motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1933 version of King Kong has some of the greatest stop motion effects I've ever seen. It also combines these stop motion effects with scenes of the actors really well. Some of the greatest movie lines ever are to be heard, such as "I'm going out to get a girl, even if I have to marry one", and "There's something on that island that no white man has ever seen". The scene where the characters see a dinosaur for the first time, they all acted pretty calm about it. The fight between King Kong and the T-Rex was one of the greatest stop motion sequences I've ever seen, and definitely the highlight of the movie. The movie has more than one "beauty and the beast" example, as not only is Kong a raging, yet gentle animal while Ann is a beautiful girl, but the sailor Jack is initially hostile towards Ann before eventually warming up to her. A great theme for this movie, "beauty and the beast".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the original King Kong at least 100 times. It was and is my favorite monster movie of all time. I think the special effects were great for that time period. I have the movie on tape,and watch it every once in awhile. It is about an unemployed actress named Ann Darrow{Fay Wray} who is down on her luck,until she meets a movie producer named Carl Denham {Robert Armstrong},who is planning on making a movie on an uncharted island,and he picks her to be the star of his movie. On their way to that island on the ship,she meets first mate John Driscoll {Bruce Cabot},and they fall in love. On the Island,they come across the natives on that island,whose chief offers to trade 6 of his women for Ann,and of course the offer is refused,so late that night while back on the ship,Ann is standing by herself on deck and is kidnapped by some of the natives,and is hurriedly taken back to the island and is offered as a bride to their god on the other side of this colossal wall. The "god" ends up being a gigantic ape that the natives call "Kong" who falls for Ann,and takes Ann and when the men on the ship discovers Ann is missing,they go on the island and try to rescue her,but most of them are killed by the ape. John Driscoll ends up rescuing Ann,and finally takes her back to the ship,but Carl Denham ends up knocking Kong out with a gas bomb and takes Kong back to New York to be put on display,but Kong escapes and wrecks havoc,and kidnaps Ann again and climbs to the very top of the Empire State Building while holding her in one hand and climbing with the other. When he finally puts Ann down on a ledge,the men in the airplanes end up shooting him many times until he is too week to hold on,and he falls to his death,and John Driscoll races up to the top to get Ann,while down below,a crowd is gathered around the dead Kong and a police officer says to Carl Denham, "Well Mr. Denham,the airplanes got him", and Mr. Denham looks at the officer and says, 'Oh no it wasn't the airplanes,it was beauty killed the beast". "Beauty and the Beast" was the theme for Mr. Denham's picture. It was a great monster movie, and seeing Kong on top of the Empire State Building and swatting at the airplanes was a classic ending to a monster movie. I was very sorry to read that Fay Wray passed away yesterday. She was indeed one of the most beautiful actresses of all time. Rest in peace Fat Wray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RKO's "King Kong" is a work of unbelievable imagination. I can only imagine what it must have been like to see the film during its original release. The film is a technical masterpiece. The way the camera dwarfs the human characters on-screen is hypnotizing. However, the stop-motion animation is, of course, the most dynamic and interesting effect in the film. Watching Kong twitch and lumber about on-screen is just as incredible an experience today as it was then, albeit for different reasons. As I write this, I could list several iconic scenes, such as Kong's first appearance and his battle with fighter planes atop the Empire State building. What is truly fascinating about the film, especially considering when it was made, is that director Merian Cooper treats Kong like the hero of the story (which he is), rather than just a special effect. That is a testament to just how classic the film really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the Greatest Film Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that King Kong [1933] is (arguably) the greatest film ever made.It is an SFX-vehicle (that, in the best way possible, I mean), akin to such as Metropolis [1927], Forbidden Planet [1956], 2001: A Space Odyssey [1968], Star Wars [1977], Titanic [1997], and The Lord of the Rings films [2001, 2002, 2003].But yet it's much, much more than just that! I have yet to see a more open-ended story on film; it's so open-ended to a point I would have otherwise thought impossible to achieve in film! It doesn't think for you or "feel" for you or tell you what to think or feel about any of it at any time.For an example, to take the whole story (an extremely rich story, BTW, being basically no more than a Modern-day retelling of the ancient tale of Beauty and the Beast) in summation: Was Kong a dangerous, murderous monster that needed to be put down? Or was Kong instead a victim of the many who were the real monsters? Well see, the film never tells you that. YOU decide, see? You get to do that at every event, at every word spoken, all throughout the entire film!The haunting score of Max Steiner is yet another big plus here. It is exceedingly great when a very effective score so well sets the tone of a film and its events therein. But there are a very few films where the score doesn't merely do just this. The score goes beyond even that and serves to actually TELL the story, coupled with the dialog and the visuals. The Day the Earth Stood Still [1951], Vertigo [1958], Taxi Driver [1976] (all three, Bernard Herrmann), and Star Wars (John Williams)--all of these do that. And King Kong [1933] is one of those as well!I've seen this again and again from time to time at various stages in my life up to now, from Early Childhood to now nearing Middle-Age, I've gotten such wildly different impressions from the film. It's like I had watched almost completely movies, a different story each time. Or even more strange and wonderful, seeing a different story but yet still in the exact same film! Wow! It is truly unbelievable the level of mastery in its cinematic storytelling! It is a masterpiece, and nothing less than! It is, even now today, and, I'm quite sure, will be for a very, very long time in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even after a dozen viewings over 50 years, King Kong still holds me spellbound. Antique that it is, it remains unsurpassed with it's thrill a minute pacing, fierce combat between Kong and all comers and pioneering special effects.Directors Merrian Cooper and Ernest Schoesdak made an original that to this day remains impossible to improve on. With visuals that must have been as awe inspiring as Kubrick's 2001 upon its release the duo stuck to the action and backed off introspection pitting the unscrupulous motor mouth adventurer Carl Denham against the quick to anger Kong. With lightening economy Denham's exploitative nature is shown how low he will go as he cruises a homeless women's shelter for what will turn out to be gorilla bait. This sleazy side of his nature is quickly overcome though with his boundless enthusiasm and he soon has us all willing to follow him to Skull Island. Enter Kong, and what an entrance as he rumbles through the jungle to the eerie chant of the natives before filling the screen with his gigantic visage. He then runs off with Denham's latest discovery, played by a frantic Fay Wray with the crew in pursuit. From here on in it's thrill a minute action before Kong is subdued and Denham takes the act to Broadway where the temperamental simian goes ape on the town before taking residence up on the Empire State building. What a finale! What a picture! Robert Armstrong's, Carl Denham is almost as memorable as Kong as he unapologetically through massive loss of life remains undaunted in his desire to showcase the Eigth Wonder of the World at any cost. Fay Wray as Kong's love interest is striking and holds her own with the two scene stealers. Then there is Kong, perplexed, love sick and suffering from culture shock. He exhibits a lot of anger and throws his weight around with devastating results but by film's end has completely won your sympathy and you feel nothing but pity for the big guy blocking traffic on 34th Street.King Kong is movie making at it's best. It's original, filled with thrills and chills, and introduces film's most recognizable character. It is without the pretension of the two expensive but abysmal remakes that strive too hard to be better when it's evident that the simplicity found in the original was all that was necessary. They got it right the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the aftermath of World War I, two different yet very similar men crossed paths with each other while working on behalf of Polish war relief: Captain Merian C. Cooper met cinematographer Ernest B. Schoedsack in Ukraine and one of the most important partnerships in cinema was born. Cooper was fascinated with cinema, and began to collaborate with Schoedsack directing documentaries. However, this two men weren't typical filmmakers, they were real adventurers with a desire to transmit the thrills of their expeditions in their movies. After several successes in this field, the duo began to make fictional films, and in 1931 the two adventurers decided to use a movie to give their audiences the most amazing adventure ever conceived. It would take them 2 years to finish it, but the result would be simply marvelous: "King Kong"."King Kong" is the story of Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker known for his movies set in exotic lands, who has a new and mysterious project but finds himself unable to find a star for the film. On the street he meets Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), a young woman who has been driven to poverty by the Great Depression. Denham convinces Darrow to join his crew, offering her a the starring role in his movie. And so they sail aboard the freighter 'Venture' and head to Denham's secret location. As the ship gets closer to it, Denham reveals them that the place they are looking for is a secret island where a legendary monster named "Kong" is supposed to live. It is only after Ann Darrow gets kidnapped by the island's inhabitants when the director discovers what he has come to find: Kong, the giant gorilla, is real, and now that he has Darrow in his hand, the crew will have to venture into the dangerous jungle to save her.The story's mix of horror, fantasy and adventure was conceived by famous crime writer Edgar Wallace and Merian C. Cooper himself, but the actual script was completed by James Ashmore Creelman and Ruth Rose (Schoedsack's wife), who developed the story and in the process created one of the most memorable adventure films in history. While the plot is certainly simple, it's filled with a constant series of thrilling scenes that literally reinvented the adventure genre in film due to their influence on subsequent films. Also, there is a good deal of character development despite some clichd (even for the time) dialogs. The fact that Rose and the directors were notorious adventurers on their own account (Apparently Denham and Driscoll are based on Cooper and Schoedsack respectively) gave the story a strong sense of realism despite its fantastic plot, as the adventure echoes the group's real expeditions.Director Ernest B. Schoedsack was definitely the best man for the job of making Cooper's ideas a reality, as his great eye for visuals and remarkable technical proficiency were instrumental in the making of this, the duo's greatest challenge. It is clear that the directors knew how to raise the suspense before the revelation of Kong, as the slow pace the film has before the arrival to the island enhances the suspense and the mystery about what is truly out there, perfectly building the right mood for what's coming next. It is also obvious that Cooper knew how to give a great show, as just as soon as the monster is revealed, the movie becomes a roller-coaster of action and adventure of enormous proportions, effectively capturing that feeling of adventure that Cooper wanted to transmit. Finally, the innovative use of the music by Max Steiner to create atmosphere is the icing of the cake in this masterpiece.While nowadays the style of the dialogs may sound corny, the performances of most of the cast were very good, specially considering that the real star was "Kong". Robert Armstrong is excellent as the enthusiast (and obsessive) filmmaker Carl Denham, and effectively portrays a man who would do anything and go anywhere to give the greatest show to his audience. As the ship's mate Jack Driscoll, Bruce Cabot makes a good job as the "hero" of this adventure, who like "Kong", gets fascinated by the beauty of the movie's new actress. Cabot's character is the typical heroic character, but he manages to make him natural and human. Finally Fay Wray gives the performance of her lifetime as Ann Darrow, as while her range as an actress was limited, in this movie she has the chance to fully show the extent of her talents, effectively delivering an iconic performance.However, the real star of this show is without a doubt Kong himself, who thanks to the astounding work of special effects done by Willis H. O'Brien and his team, achieves a characterization never before seen for a character that was entirely created by special effects. O'Brien, who had previously worked his magic in the silent classic "The Lost World", creates in Kong his masterpiece as he makes this monster look alive and able to express feelings better than most actors. While the directors and the writers do deserve credit for this character, it was ultimately O'Brien who gave the final touch to the legendary monster, making us feel identified with the confused beast as it faces the attack of the world. Even now, more than 70 years later, his work of animation in this movie remains one of the finest ever made. If there is an adjective that can describe adequately the impact of this movie in history, that would be "mythic", as very few movies have left in our culture an impression as deep as "King Kong" did. Not only the image of the movie's grand finale is still one of the most powerful scenes in cinema, but this movie effectively created a legend out of the sad story of its title character and the exciting adventure that took him to New York. A masterpiece in every aspect. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true gem of the 1930s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely the best movie of its age and even by today's ratings, seventy-three years since this thrilling movie priemered, it still holds out above many others. It is so well-liked and powerful that two remakes, several television series, novels, and other works of art have been based on it. The original King Kong is definitely one of the top movies ever made. And it holds a special place in motion picture history that few people notice. Rules for the future of many genres of movies were being invented in King Kong.King Kong is also a pretty great achievement for its age, because it was made during the Great Depression, on a probably diminishing budget, and it was an original work. There was no novel or story that led to its creation. There was just the anticipations of Mercian C. Cooper and the lost dinosaur-adventure project of Willis O'Brien called "Creation." These two elements combined help make this movie a masterpiece.King Kong sure shocked me when I first saw it at the age of ten. It just stunned me beyond belief. When I sat down to watch it, I was expecting an old-fashioned B-monster movie even faker than Godzilla or anything else like that. But I was sure surprised when I saw the majesticness of this movie. Special effects wise, its terrific concerning its time. The creatures, created through stop-motion, are very realistic when compared to others of their age. And I wasn't expecting any dinosaurs at all when I first saw King Kong. I was just expecting an enormous gorilla with a bad attitude. But when that stegosaurus appeared out of nowhere on screen and more dinosaurs followed afterward throughout the movie, it helped my expectations build up. All of which were matched or exceeded. And then I realized that Kong wasn't just a giant gorilla with an attitude. He is a great character, who may seem destructive and dangerous at first, but is developed to reveal that he has a soul in his heart. And we end up really feeling for this creature when he gets killed in the end.But half of the power of this movie is owed to the works of stop-motion pioneer Willis O'Brien and music score-master Max Steiner. O'Brien created several very realistic creatures, some of which were unfortunately cut out. And Steiner's powerful score really enhanced this movie's quality. It's so great that it's been rated high in the history of music. When we want terror, the music's intense. When we want a romantic scene, it's heart-gripping. And when we come to Kong's eventual death, it's so soul-shredding, we're almost crying. But in King Kong, Steiner chose a different death music piece. Instead of the commonly-used slow-motion scream-like music that we see in a lot of movies, this movie had a death scene with a score that was boomingly loud, yet more powerful than any other death score we've ever heard.King Kong is a landmark in film history. Many ideas and inspirations are owed to this movie. And with the recent remake done by Peter Jackson, the legacy of this movie shall live on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson's KONG comes out tomorrow. I'm sure millions will love it and it'll make a fortune. Good for him, I have nothing against the guy, but every clip I see from the new movie makes me want to see it less. The ape jumps around like Spiderman, the camera swoops and dives mercilessly, and every single frame seems calculated to remind you that the whole thing is FAKE. When Cooper, Shoedsack and O'Brien made the original in 1933 they were men who knew what real adventure was like and they busted their collective asses to bring that sense of adventure to the screen, and they succeeded admirably. The whole movie has an almost documentary feel (many of the incidents were in fact taken from real life) as if the filmmakers had actually discovered an island where prehistoric beasts roamed and simply set down their cameras to record it. Even the dialogue, much maligned by those too naive to know better, is an accurate reflection of the way people really felt and spoke when the picture was made. The original (the only) KING KONG is a timeless classic in the truest sense of the word, and all others (by DeLaurentis, Jackson, and any other posers to come) can only be pale imitations. You can only make a classic once. Hail to the King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 8th Wonder of the Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said?(Possible spoilers, though doubtful) One of the most imaginative, creative, and spectacular action/horror films ever made. It was decades ahead of its time in many ways. It influenced Spielberg, Jackson, you name it; a whole generation of filmmakers. As a kid in pre-Star Wars days, it was breathtaking to watch on TV (a station always showed it every year on Thanksgiving night after Miracle on 34th Street, go figure). Yes, by today's standards, the effects aren't perfect. But HEY! this was about 5 or 6 years after films began talking! Considering it would be some 30 years before effects would come near it, and another 15 or so before they passed it, that is something. Consider today, effects are primarily computerized, and let's not forget, something that looks like a computerized monster is no less fake (something I hope filmmakers figure out, and fast), and that is after 70 years of technological development. And after all that, they are rendered obsolete within a couple years. The fight between Kong and the T-Rex (or allosaurus) can almost stand against effects out there even today. But I digress. I shouldn't have to defend the special effects; those who say they look cheesy need only remember that our greatest triumphs today ? of which there are few ? will be laughed at years from now just the same. The acting is at times tough, but this was the first generation of talking film actors. They had nobody to learn from. Not to mention that it was the acting style of the day. Some have said the movie was about subtle in-jokes, maybe so. But it remains always a film ride that ? unless you are ignorant enough to expect 21st century production values ? will take your breath away. The segment from when the men run into the jungle after Kong up to the break after the T-Rex fight is about as breathtaking as you get. As a child, I was almost exhausted by the time that part was done. The atmosphere, the scale of adventure, the scope of story telling: all first rate. Also, it so wonderfully blended the mindset of the age with its inspired story telling. It was the last era of innocence before WWII and the modern nuclear age. It was a time when little ? though some ? of the world was unexplored. A time when industrialization was taking over, and there seemed no limit to what humanity could accomplish, and no price we were not willing to pay. Dinosaurs and tribal witchdoctors, ancient stone walls and forgotten islands. And on the other side: the Empire State Building (the ultimate expression of industrial might and ingenuity), airplanes (only around for a decade and a half as weapons ? the most 'modern' weapon available), movies (still only a couple decades old for all practical purposes), and New York City, the largest and most advanced city in the world. What contrasts! And all right at hand for the writers. In short, it made its point without having to make it obvious. It will be a long time before there are so many symbols at hand for a new story to fall into place so smoothly. And of course, the iconic image of Kong on the Empire State Building ? enough said.One other observation. Note that there isn't much overt morality. Nobody is really 'the bad guy'(and thus deserving of a terrible, gruesome death). The sailors killed are not 'bad' , or made bad for (horror of horrors) suggesting that they shoot at Kong first, or even daring to consider killing a helpless 50 foot gorilla. Carl Denham is not 'bad', the natives on the island are not 'bad', the victims in New York aren't bad, even Kong isn't bad, he's just doing his thing. Everyone is just doing their thing, sometimes good, sometimes bad, but never inherently bad people or animals. Today, of course, you would have the stereotypical lawyer/corporate exec/fanatic politician/religious extremist/merciless hunter; all who deserve death, because they are 'bad people' because of their ideals or beliefs (the modern acceptable prejudice). Kong would be misunderstood, a victim of horrible western heartlessness or corporate greed, and those who die deserve it for messing with his life and the purity of nature. And the soon-to-be-deceased would meet their deserved demise after a scene demonstrating their evil hearts by doing and/or saying something blatant to drive the point of their badness home to any that might have missed it. Ah, but the good old days, when a film could actually make you wonder who the bad guy really is, and if there isn't, make you wonder even more about what you have seen and why things had to happen that way.King Kong is considered a classic. It earned it. The remake in the 1970s, flagrant in its moral sermonizing, struggled at best. Who knows, maybe Peter Jackson will navigate modern expectations with the elements of the original to produce a remake worthy of the first without turning it into a floppy CGI based morality play. Let's hope. But in all of its glory or bumbling, whichever the case will prove, let the 2005 remake never overshadow the original and its unique impression it left for generations to come. I give it a 10 only because there is not a higher score to assign.</fullReview>

Many directors today, like Steven Spielberg , claim that this was one of their inspirations for making movies.This film was paced just right, from the beginning in New York City, to Skull Island and back to NYC. The stop animation was simply incredible! We now need Kong to be released on DVD. Wouldn't you just love to see at least a 2 Disc set with four or five hours of extras?!

		<fullReview>When such weak 1990s efforts as the Matrix, Se7en, Fight Club, The Shawshank Redemption and American Beauty are so high up on the imdb list, and King Kong is hardly on the list, this should tell you that there is something wrong with the system. Sure, King Kong looks a little silly, but you can't expect it to look great, at least in the special effects area, after nearly 70 years. Besides, I say "a little silly" emphasizing "little." The stop-motion animation may seem crude, but I would take it over the computer animation of films today anytime. The only great computer animation, in my opinion (excluding movies made completely with computer animation; I'm talking about computer animated characters on screen with live action characters), is Jurassic Park. The dinosaurs looked real in that film. Every other film that uses computer animated characters, MIB, The Phantom Menace, etc, looks terrible. The computer animated characters look so extraordinarily like they were made on a computer. It looks like one could just click a button and get rid of Jar-Jar Binks (and we all wish we could). King Kong, as well as the other monsters on Skull Island, look like they're on the screen with the human actors. The dinosaurs, especially the brontosaurus (or apatasaurus, if you will), look nearly as good as the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. And King Kong looks a lot better than the terrible 1970s version of the same film. Could you imagine a computer animated King Kong? It makes me sick just to think about it. King Kong is not the summit of stop-motion animation. Ray Harryhausen perfected the technique in films like Jason and the Argonauts and Clash of the Titans. But that was over thirty years later. King Kong's effects look great still.But to spend a lot of time on the effects, defending them, is unnecessary in order to prove the film's worth. It's great in every other aspect, too. Acting. Fay Wray is amazing, as well as all the other players. Direction? Amazing, all the way. The filmmakers take a lot of chances, and every one of them works. The script is also great. Perhaps the best part of the film is the cinematography. I'm not sure, but it looks to me like it was shot in deep focus. Orson Welles did not, of course, invent this technique. He just utilized it to the max. So it is not impossible that it was shot in that way. In every way, King Kong is a masterpiece. It is one of the most unabashedly amusing films ever committed to celluloid, with its only competition being, perhaps, The Wizard of Oz. I love this movie. Why don't you? 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is an amazing and ambitious cinematic adventure, especially when you take into account that it was made in 1933. The acting is pretty decent, and the story itself is great and has been copied many times, but where it really shines is in the stop motion animation, which may look silly to some now a days, in our cgi world, but for its time, it was a movie marvel. I know Peter Jackson loved this movie enough to remake it, but for my money, his version can't compare with the original, and in truth I wish he wouldn't have tried.

		<shortDescription>Still The Eighth Wonder of the World...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KING KONG was one of those unforgettable childhood wonders that STILL manages to evoke a sense of wonder: using every sleight-of-hand movie-making technique then known to Man (and as well as pioneering a few new ones specifically for this occasion), Willis O'Brien and Company gave us "The Eighth Wonder of the World!" I confess: I blasphemed when I touted the Peter Jackson version over this one; beat me, please- I deserve it. It would've been interesting to see the KING KONG VS. FRANKENSTEIN O'Brien had in mind as a follow-up. (The "mutated" version of that idea became the Japanese Kaiju classic, FRANKENSTEIN CONQUERS THE WORLD, in which an irradiated HEART literally blossoms into the giant "Frankenstein" monster; the sequel, WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS, featured no reference to the earlier dust-up and NEITHER film credits O'Brien with the original idea.) When I arrived here in Crack Town, the disembodied head of the giant mechaniKong built for the heartbreakingly bad De Laurentis remake was on display outside of what was then Carolco Studios. I shot video of several kids sitting inside Kong's mouth and had planned to do a short about a boy who keeps dreaming that he's being eaten alive by a giant gorilla (in the end, he was to have been found dead of fright in the jaws of the giant head), but it never worked out. It's just as well, I guess: there've been a LOT of bad movies inspired by KING KONG; who needs one more...?</fullReview>

The special effects were astounding in 1933, and they're still pretty damn good.I know that Peter Jackson's heart is in the right place, but his remake just doesn't have the heart of the original. His Kong doesn't have the soul of the original. Willis O'Brien, the special effects wizard on the first King Kong, was somehow able to invest an armature made of metal and fur with a personality. On the other hand, the less said about the 1976 Dino De Laurentiis atrocity, the better.The original King Kong is one of the greatest movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who couldn't love the big ape?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most baby-boomers, I fell in love with the 1933 "King Kong" after viewing it on local TV. In 2005, I put off buying the deluxe DVD version so that my family would have a gift to get for me at Christmastime. I was dying to pass the legend of this movie on to my then-nine-year-old son, but such are latter-day attention spans that I actually had to make him promise me an afternoon where he'd sit and watch it with me. He's now seen it three times since then.Sure, the movie has flaws. I'll tick some off for you. Some of the dialogue is stilted in a way that only 1930s scripting can be. ("Why...I guess I love you!" declares sailor Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot) to "bothersome" female passenger Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), with all the passion of a shipman who's discovered an extra bottle of hootch on board.) As befits the movie's then-revolutionary stop-motion animation technique, monster ape King Kong's fur often wavers from frame to frame, in much the same way as Gromit's doggie features hardly stand still from one frame to the next in the clay-animated "Wallace and Gromit" feature movie.But you just gotta love the movie's fearlessness. Without an ounce of irony, the non-real Kong gets his own movie credit as "the eighth wonder of the world." There's no question that, as movie impresario Carl Denham, Robert Armstrong is whole ham ?- yet that's what makes the character so wonderful. Most "fearless" movie heroes these days (paging Bruce Willis!) have only a steel chin and a sneer to offer the movie camera. Denham is not only fearless, he's enthusiastic about it, as if he just can't help putting his entire crew in peril just to get a good close-up.Fay Wray, of course, immortalized herself as a scream queen in her role as Kong's temptress Ann Darrow. But even her screams are fun, because they're so genuine. It's a role that she could have conceivably turned into a camp classic (much as poor Jessica Lange did in the 1976 version); after all, in the end we know she's caterwauling to a clay model just a few feet tall. But Wray really is sincere enough to convince us she's getting manhandled by a perilous monster. My only regret is that she didn't end up showing just a little emotion for this overgrown kid who eventually lays down his life for her (which, thanks to Naomi Watts, was one of the few elements that Peter Jackson's 2005 version did get right).Even the deaths in the movie aren't terribly painful. When Kong shakes a huge log where some of his would-be captors are clinging for dear life, and many of them fall to the gorge below, it's more like the roller-coaster ride the movie was intended to be; the poor fellas are merely the 30s predecessors to all those nameless extras who got evaporated on the original "Star Trek." Contrast that with the endless emphasis on graphic violence and death in Peter Jackson's version (which traumatized my son so much that we had to exit the movie after it was only one-third finished).Finally, there's Max Steiner's ground-breaking musical score. At the advent of talkies, it was unheard of for an entire orchestral score to accompany a movie's story, and if you doubt the staying power of Steiner's music (he went on to score classics as diverse as "Gone with the Wind" and "Casablanca"), listen to one of the latter-day music-only CDs of Kong's soundtrack. It holds up as well as any movie score of the 1930's and beyond; it's like an old-time radio show in itself.The DVD version only exponentially adds to the fun, with extras such as a documentary on Kong co-writer and -director Merian C. Cooper, who was the obvious inspiration for Carl Denham ? and who, with co-creator Ernest B. Schoedsack, "piloted" one of the planes that gunned down Kong from the Empire State Building in the movie's legendary climax). And even Peter Jackson's detractors (myself among them, if you haven't guessed) will enjoy the DVD segment in which Jackson and his "King Kong" crew painstakingly recreate an entire sequence ? the "extras'" fall into the gorge, which held the added peril of a giant spider ? that was ruthlessly edited out of the movie somewhere along the way."King Kong" inspired generations of filmmakers as the ultimate example of how a movie could breathe life (and terror) into an inanimate object. Ironically, until "Star Wars" came along, most Hollywood movies had forgotten how to combine thrills and fun without gore ?- a lesson that "King Kong" should have taught them long ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is a Giant monster adventure film directed and produced by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack that tells of a gigantic island-dwelling ape creature called Kong who dies in an attempt to possess a beautiful young woman. It stars Fay Wray, Bruce Cabot and Robert Armstrong.The screenplay was by Ruth Rose and James Ashmore Creelman from a story by Cooper and Edgar Wallace.The film is distinguished for its stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and its musical score by Max Steiner.Disembarking at Skull Island, they stumble on a ceremony in which the native dancers circle around a terrified-looking young girl, chanting, "Kong! Kong!" The chief and witch doctor spot Denham and company and order them to leave. But upon seeing Ann, the chief offers to buy the "golden woman" to serve as the "bride of Kong." Denham refuses, and he and the others beat a hasty retreat to their ship. Late that night, a party of native warriors sneak on board the ship and kidnap Ann. They strap her to a huge sacrificial altar just outside the gate, then summon Kong, who winds up saving Ann instead of devouring her. Kong is eventually taken back to New York, where he breaks loose on the night of his Broadway premiere, thinking that his beloved Ann is being hurt by the reporters' flash bulbs. Now at large in New York, Kong searches high and low for Ann. After proving his devotion by wrecking an elevated train, Kong winds up at the top of the Empire State Building, facing off against a fleet of World War I fighter planes.Even allowing for its slow start, wooden acting and wall-to-wall screaming, there is something ageless and primeval about King Kong that still somehow works as it has the ability that mystifies as well as it horrifies.Still,it manages to explore the soul of a monster that is making viewer scream and cry throughout the film in large part due to Kong's breakthrough special effects during its time of release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Next to Frankenstein this is another favorite classic movie of mine. I particularly love the stop motion use of this movie with real footage. for it's time this movie is an amazing feat for special effects. especially the scenes between king Kong and Anne Darrow. And though this is a classic and sometimes even typical favorite part of the movie, the new york city scenes are amazing. The lush set designs of the jungle to the busy streets of new york are amazing. i love the integration of other dinosaur like creatures as well. this movie covers it all and i couldn't have been anymore happy with a monster movie. It has a great story, great suspense, and amazing film work. Sure, you could watch the newest epic Peter Jackson version, but even that doesn't quite grasp the classic, though a worthy remake. I own this movie on DVD and had to watch the behind the scenes making of and that shows how truly spectacular this movie is and how much it accomplished in its time period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best monster movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a personal note, I am a big fan of the 2005 remake, so the film that inspired it will hold a special place in my heart.King Kong is as simple as storytelling gets, beauty and the beast. At the time, the film was most known and praised for it's special effects. Thanks to Willis O'Brien's special effects, Kong and his dinosaur buddies cam come to life in a time where special effects had never been utilized like this before.Although the film is nowhere near today's standards, it still stands as one of the greats of all time. A favorite scene of mine is Kong's fight with the tyrannosaurus rex, this one scene must have taken quite a while to animate and I can appreciate the time it took in order to pull it off.To miss out on this film is to miss out on one of the greats in American cinema. It's won numerous awards and has climbed to the top of several critics lists. It was beauty who killed the beast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great King Kong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many films can truly be said to be definitive? The answer is probably "not many", but the original 1933 version of King Kong is certainly one of them. For its time, every aspect is innovative. First-of-their-kind special effects, first-of-its-kind plot, famous performances and a final sequence that remains unequalled as an eye-popping cinematic experience. The quality of cinematography and visual trickery has progressed a long way since 1933 - so the special effects obviously look rather primitive to 21st Century eyes - but anyone with a shred of common sense will still be astounded by what they see. This is movie history in the making. Had this never been made, the whole history of films may have taken a different course.Ace film director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) hires an unemployed, attractive New York woman Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) to star in his new picture. He takes her by boat to remote Skull Island where, according to legend, there lives an awesome god-like beast named Kong. Denham's plan is to shoot a variation of the Beauty and the Beast story, using Ann as his beauty and Kong as his beast. Everyone involved gets more than they bargained for when Ann is kidnapped by the island natives and offered as a sacrifice to Kong. She is kidnapped by a gigantic prehistoric ape and saved only by the courage of ship's mate Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot). But Denham has one more trick up his sleeve when he captures Kong and takes the beast back to New York. You don't really think those chains will hold him, do you? Virtually every monster movie ever made owes something to King Kong - even colossal modern hits like Jurassic Park, The Lost World and Godzilla (not to mention thousands of small scale homages such as The Land Unknown and Gorgo). It is arguably the most influential film of all-time. I genuinely envy people who were lucky enough to experience this film during its 1933 opening week - what must they have thought? Did they realize they were witnessing something utterly extraordinary? I could go on all day giving reasons why you should see it, but it would be pointless. It can all be summed up in one sentence: if you have even the slightest interest in movies SEE THIS FILM!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Monster Movie Which Paved the Way for the Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Godzilla", "Jaws", "Alien", "Indiana Jones", "Jurassic Park", and countless other films owe much to the original "King Kong" of 1933. Although by modern standards some of the acting and dialog are a bit dated, and the special effects not as slick as today, Kong is the greatest monster movie prior to the Lucas-Spielberg era beginning in 1975. Despite its shortcomings, Kong still upholds fairly well in the 21st century. There is something timeless about this movie, particularly in the sound department. No one could scream like Fay Wray and no one could grunt like Kong.The story of "Kong" comes out of a tradition of fantasy-adventure fiction which was in vogue from circa 1885 to 1940 beginning with the Allan Quartermain adventure novels of the very late 19th century, the first of which was "King Solomon's Mines". Until Tolkein nearly single-handedly change the genre, fantasy fiction of this period often depicted European and American adventurers entering some kind of exotic land, written by the likes of Edgar Rice Burroughs, C.L. Moore, A. Merrit, even Arthur Conan Doyle. The land was often populated by exotic creatures, usually dinosaurs or similar beasties, and in the middle would be some kind of sentient tribe. They could be humanoid, but sometimes they could be reptilian. The modern adventurers would enter the secluded world either by ship or biplane, and their exploration would turn to confrontation. The confrontation and then the conflict were often the result of the explorer-strangers either pilfering something from this world, such as an artifact or even a princess, or desecrating some kind of ritual or ceremony by their mere presence. In Kong, all of the above occurs. The original "King Kong" possesses all the elements of a fantasy-adventure novel from the early 20th century: an exotic unchartered island, native peoples who are enmeshed with the lore and legend of their island, and the taking of something from the island by those from the modern world. And of course, there is Kong, the star of the show, the creature which makes all other monstrous creatures pale in comparison until the advent of "Alien" in 1979. What makes both "Alien" and "Kong" so horrifying is their combination of brutality and sentience. Unlike dinosaurs which always seem to kill out of mindless instinct, Kong and Alien know exactly what they're doing. A giant ape-creature which exudes sentience seems infinitely more terrifying than even a T-Rex, and a T-Rex is certainly quite unsettling. But the grunting of Kong heard in the distance is an aspect which keeps you on the edge of your seat.The setup for the revelation of the beast I think is one of the best in filmmaking. Instead of showing the baddie instantly, there is a gradual build-up, beginning with the map. The map is of an island. On the island is a wall. On one side of the wall are islanders engaged in a worship ceremony for that which is behind the wall. It even appears to be akin to some kind of sacrifice. What lurks behind the wall is the focus of the rituals.It has been said there are only two kinds of stories: a stranger comes to town or someone leaves town, or a combination of the two. "Kong" incorporates both. Strangers from the civilized world come to a lost island. And then something from the island is forced to leave. This is one of the great classics of motion pictures. I have only one suggestion: it would be interesting if some post-production wizards smoothed out some of the stop-motion animation and made it a little more 21st-century friendly without compromising the main idea of the film. Just a suggestion.</fullReview>

There will never be anything remotely like it. KONG takes you into its magical and fantastic world from which you will never escape - luckily. Fay Wray's performance is legendary, and even Bruce Cabot makes a likable hero. The photography and the sets are stunning, and Skull Island itself simply oozes with menace and mystery. Willis O'Brien was a classic innovator, and his protg, Ray Harryhausen, has mastered the art - fortunately for the likes of us. Jackson did a fair effort at recreating this monster movie, but his ape simply lacked the compassion and the inherent personality that Willis was able to instill within his creation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A+King Kong is probably the ultimate icon of film ever. For a movie well over 70 years old, it's fairly simple plot is known by millions. I saw it when I was but a small boy, and have loved it ever sense then. The stop motion effects by Willis O'Brien are legendary and rightfully so. These effects were painstakingly done by hand and the general audience as well as future film makers would do well to respect the art of stop motion. "King Kong" encompasses the action, adventure, fantasy, and even somewhat of the mystery genre all in one beautiful motion. The pacing is perfect, and the score by Max Steiner is amazing at every turn. One who does not respect this film truly has no place in film. It taps into the imagination of anyone who watches it.</fullReview>

The movie gives us a look at the heart and soul of the beast in a way that makes us care for Kong. Nothing like this was ever accomplished or done as well until Disney's Beauty and the Beast. Intelligent, but also accessible for the everyday person, it is certainly a must for movie buffs and even just the average movie-goer. A true wonder of storytelling and a landmark in non-human acting. Kong gives the best performance of the entire film and dominates every scene he is in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Excitement put to film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sick of constant CGI. Now, that doesn't mean I hate all CGI. Some things in movies need to be CGI. The Lord of the Rings had amazing CGI, but only when it was necessary. A lot of what you see in that trilogy is actually present there. Rather than making the orcs CG, they are actual people in prosthetics and make-up. Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark did it all without CGI, and with amazing practical effects. But many modern movies resort to CGI for every scene. Every scene in the Star Wars prequel trilogy has CGI. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had a lot of unnecessary CGI. The Hobbit had CGI orcs, while the Rings trilogy relied on prosthetics for these creatures. So many movies use CGI in every scene, and I'm tired of it. CGI has a place in film, but not in every scene. That is part of why it is such a relief to go back to the first 40 years of film and see King Kong. Seeing these practical effects such as stop- motion put to such great use is wonderful. The stop motion is absolutely amazing and nearly flawless. The models are excellently made. But there is more to the movie than just these effects. Everyone knows the story. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) is a passionate genius filmmaker who sets off with his film crew to make a picture on a mysterious island. When he gets there, his female star Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) is kidnapped by natives and left to be a sacrifice to Kong, a giant gorilla. But rather than killing her, Kong becomes obsessed with her, and takes her back to his cave. She is rescued by sailor John Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), and Denham subdues Kong. He then decides to take Kong back to New York and make millions. But there, Kong breaks free and kidnaps Ann again, resulting in a city-wide rampage and a climax on the top of the Empire State Building. It has been a long time since I have seen a movie this exciting. The whole movie is thrilling, even before we see Kong. The best part of the movie is the hunt for Kong. The whole chase is tense and suspenseful, and amazing to see. Seeing the human characters alongside the stop- motion beasts is stunning for the time. I love seeing Kong fight a dinosaur. The whole chase is non-stop thrills. The climax on top of the Empire State Building is great as well, with great effects and cinematography, but nothing can top the jungle chase. The characters are products of films of that day. They didn't have much depth, and they didn't need it. It's simply a monster story. And of course, we have our monster. Kong is simply one of the best things ever. He is awesome. He's threatening (albeit fake-looking) and wreaks death and destruction, but he's a sympathetic animal as well. The sets of the film are some of the best I've ever seen. They are all actually there, and look like it. The score is great as well, creating a threatening and dramatic feel. All these things make King Kong great, and possibly the greatest film I've ever seen. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Say, I guess I love you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fascinated by those who criticize `Kong' based on the exploitative, and inhumane, attitudes of its characters toward the island's native creatures and tribesmen. I don't think you can really judge the attitudes of the past based upon our own, current conceptions of what's right and wrong because really, in a nutshell, generations before just didn't know any better. For us to expect anyone to think beyond their own times is asking way too much. Visionaries of any generation are the exception, not the rule, and usually struggle to enlighten the rest of us. Who knows what future generations will think of us?That said, in looking at `Kong' through modern eyes, the meaning of the story does indeed continue to expand well beyond the intentions of its creators. That's what makes this movie so great. It still hits a nerve somewhere. Most people, for instance, can easily come away with more sympathy for Kong (not to mention his island inhabitants) than his captors. What is the significance of that? Have we progressed beyond this type of insensitivity and what kind of irony can be read into the ending? There is some interesting symbolism represented in this film as well. From the ominous gates of Skull Island to the power of the Empire State Building, many parallels between these two cultures map out a questionable (or is it justifiable?) path toward `progress' in the modern age. Discuss amongst yourselves, class.Well, anyway?for those of you who don't have the patience for analytical discussion and are mainly interested in the pure function of story and plot, `Kong' still packs a wallop. As a member of the `Star Wars' generation, I was amazed at how completely enthralling the action still is, even though the special effects and dialogue certainly seem `cheesy' by today's standards (it bears mention, however, that the effects, taken in the context of their times are amazing ? and continue to be when one considers the intricate craftsmanship that went into not only creating them, but blending them in with the live action). The filmmakers here still manage to create a character out of Kong himself via their models, but also use the conventions of editing, music and sound throughout these sequences to present a timeless mixture of excitement, suspense and even, in the end, pathos. The violence is effectively used and appropriately brutal (I suspect that this was pre-Hays Code?). And notice the choice NOT to have score in certain moments. It makes the atmosphere downright awesome and spooky (much of the NYC stage show and Kong's defeat of the giant lizard come to mind).Ah, and then there's the fair, the lovely, Fay Wray. Okay, her acting style seems very much rooted in the methods of silent star exposition ? this was after all made on the heels of the talkie advent. But there are two things that still make her inseparable from the success of this film: 1) her scream is unsurpassed and undoubtedly set the template for future Janet Leighs and Judith O'Sheas (oh yes, there are different ways to scream my friends!); 2) her beauty, I think, still fits in with today's standards - and that's not always the case with actresses of the past. Fay Wray, as she was, is definitely very easy on the eyes and continues to be. Hail! All witness the power of the Golden Woman! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Problems in scripting and acting are covered by great effects and a superb central character in Kong himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carl Denham is a famous producer who is well known for getting the pictures in on time. Under pressure to get a romantic interest into his new film, he finds it hard to get an actress that will work for him so he resorts to picking up talent off the street in the shape of Ann Darrow. However none of the cast or crew are prepared for what awaits them at the end of their sea voyage ? an island with fearful natives, giant gates and one massive secret, a beast who the native know as Kong. Things get worse when the villagers decide that the beautiful blonde Ann will make an acceptable bride for Kong and steal her as a living sacrifice.It's funny that while many of us deride the modern effects-driven blockbusters, it is easy to forget that this film was just that ? an average film that was a must-see on the basis of its special effects! What makes this one such a classic is perhaps the fact that it managed to be cutting edge and also produce and 'effect' in Kong that was much more of a character than any of the humans in the story and is a memorable one at that. Anyway, musing aside, this is not a great film in some areas but still deserves the label 'classic'. The plot is basic but effective and, although it takes a while to get going, once Kong is on the screen the film is much more exciting and involving. The first half is not helped by the pretty poor dialogue and acting that make it feel like a drag but I suppose, at the time, this would have helped build the tension.However Kong is worth seeing the film for. In terms of effects, they may not stand up against modern work but it would be foolish to think that they would. However they are impressive still in a rather old-school type of way ? they are certainly better than some modern effects work in some video horrors I have seen! They be on backdrops, look rubbery and be unrealistic but they still work for me ? Kong is a great effect and a great character. He is dangerous but yet sensitive, the bad guy but yet the one we really feel for, a beast but yet strangely human in his expressions and emotions ? and many of these come down to him not just being a rubbery effect but being one with good facial control and a body movement that would count as a good performance if he were human. Of course modern audiences will mostly see this as a curio and look to the upcoming remake to give them the effects they want but for my money this is still worthy of being called a classic ? the New York finale alone is worth seeing it for, but don't forget that it is the jungle where we get to know and feel for Kong.Overall, the dialogue is roundly average at best; the performances are reasonable enough but not that good (apart from the odd good touch Wray's performance is mostly screaming) and the plot is well known to even those who have not seen the film! However the effects are still enjoyable, even if they have lost their ability to impress in the same way as they did in the thirties but the sets and scale of the film is all still impressive. But really it is Kong that is the main attraction and, if Peter Jackson should do anything, he must ensure that his 'beast' has the same complex character and ability to make the audience feel different things as the original did. Not a perfect film but it is rightly a classic and no number of remakes will stop me coming back to the thirties for my fix!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marian cooper's "king Kong" (1933)is incredibly innovative for a horror flick. One innovative aspect of this film is that its a film with a theme surrounding the making of a film. "king Kong" definitely has to be the film that influenced many other directors to shoot off set, especially for the sake of authenticity much like Mr.Denham. In the film, Denham strives to be different to "show people something they've never seen before" he is determined to capture authentic shots as oppose to the generic Hollywood set. In new York he seeks a young beautiful woman for his latest horror flick. There is some meaning behind the idea of this movie. the obvious and very often stated "'twas beauty who killed the beast". In a way king Kong is kind of like the early 1930s horror classic "Frankenstein" in the sense of the monster in these stories are not really monsters or what people distinguish as monstrous, evil, bad, even wicked. These "monsters" genuinely know no better than a child. Great film!</fullReview>

Some other films from the era focused on what they were not showing you to create suspense. This was largely due to the fact that the technology of the time would not allow a lot of things to be shown. Here, however, you see the unrealistic monster through much of the movie. I understand that, for the time, this was amazing. But I can't purge my brain of its built in expectations of how movie effects should look.

		<fullReview>Merian Cooper's "King Kong," in my opinion, has been and will be revered as one of the greatest horror movies ever for its time. As Hollywood ages, movies can become better looking, have better acting, and more complex story lines but I will always view 1933's "King Kong" as the best of its time. It is a timeless classic. The storyline was one of the first of its kind and drew me in from beginning to end. The story was laid out in a way in which the viewer feels the suspense the characters might feel. Each scene leads you to wonder at the next, nothing is given away too soon or too late, the storytelling is precise and suspenseful. The acting, I felt, was good acting for the time. The characters were cast well and I do not agree with critics who feel as though the acting is lackluster. The cinematography was beautiful but the sound was what caught my attention most when watching this film. The score was magnificent, each scene was enhanced and given even more depth when listening to the score. It captivated my attention even more than the brilliant stop-motion live-action scenes. Kong himself is, and always will be, the greatest monster of all time and his 1933 debut will forever be known as one of the greatest horror movies of its time.</fullReview>

See if there was anything in the original that was either taken out or changed in the Jackson film. Now I know that with the original that the special effects are not as good looking. However, what needs to be realized is that this film was made in the early 1930s. And the fact that in some scenes in the film where the actress was in the hands of King Kong that shows that the studio went to such great lengths to build these amazing props. The stop motion animation may not be the greatest but it will have to do. If you haven't seen this film it is a must.

		<fullReview>"King Kong" is one of the most memorable and important films of the early sound era, and to this day it remains more impressive than any of the many remakes/ spin-offs/ sequels which it inspired. Willis O'Brien takes his stop-motion craft from "The Lost World" to a whole new level with "Kong": unlike that film, this stars more than "just" various prehistoric monsters; Kong is a character whom we come to care and root for in the end. O'Brien's work here introduced the concept of a creature becoming the central focus of a story, laying the foundation for everyone from Ray Harryhausen to Andy Serkis. A hundred years from now people will still be talking about THIS film, and the remakes and knock-offs will at best be a mere footnote in film history. Hopefully someday this makes it into the top 250 on IMDb; it is far worthier than many of the titles currently on there.</fullReview>

Kong kills many in very graphic ways. This upfront brutality makes a stark contrast to Kong's gentleness when holding Fay. Both the city and jungle sets are perfect.

		<fullReview>This is a very early meta-film, meaning it is a film about film. I feel like this is what gets it a lot of attention - aside from the groundbreaking special effects that won audiences over back in the day. The theme of Carl Denham's film within the film is about Beauty and the Beast, which happens to be the theme of King Kong itself.Carl Denham is portrayed as a man who stops at nothing in order to get his shots right, a very devoted director. He comes across as hot- headed and funnier than Jack Black's portrayal in Jackson's version. His character progression reaches its climax with the delivery of the line "we've got something worth more than all the movies in the world!" Brilliant writing in my opinion.This may seem strange, but what turns me off from this movie a bit is specifically what it is known for - its special effects. I know its effects were groundbreaking for the time the film was released, but I still found them to be distracting, or not very well done. While it is cool that this film portrays giant monsters fighting - a great deal of spectacle - the stop-motion effects take away a lot from whatever reality is portrayed in the film.It also bothers me how this movie is heavily focused on the Beauty and the Beast theme, but there seems to be no sympathy for Kong once "beauty killed the beast." So where is there a progression? Character-wise or Kong-wise? Denham realizes that beauty killed the beast, but he does not seem changed at all by this observation. As for Kong, we see him go on a rampage and take the leading lady up to the top of the Empire State Building, but we don't really identify with him at all. While Jackson's version may be too long, at least it portrays a connection between beauty and the beast, and we actually see a motivation for what Kong's actions are.This is still a good movie, but I am not sure whether it should hold such a high spot on American Film Institute's 100 list. It is groundbreaking, yes, but I don't find the effects to be compelling and I don't really identify with any characters in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The famous king Kong movie starts here in the 1930's. There have been numerous recreations however, none can compare to the original. From the unbeatable sound track that ties to movie together to the dramatic acting from each individual character this movie is a classic. The very idea of a horror-type movie was just emerging during this time period. This movie had a bit of every genre that would allow all different types of movie-goers to enjoy. Director Merian Cooper definitely had a wonderful vision when coming up with the scenes for this movie. The different dynamics for each part of the movie, whether it be the actors/actresses, the sounds, the camera angles, the costumes, even the amazing (for it's time) special effects, all make this movie an unforgettable one. Although most people would prefer the newer versions of this timeless movie, watching the original is well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun romp through Hollywood and its production values of the time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a historian or a fan of this genre, simply watched for face value appreciation. Is the adventure, special effects or drama riveting? As seen through todays' eyes, the answer is no. The director in the movie is always talking to the audience, whether or not the characters on screen know it, so there is certainly another level of appreciation to experience. Yet the events play out as corny set ups for the next Hollywood writing set up. Fay Wray and her exposure to the colossal beast that is Kong is both funny and poignantly. As out giant gorilla kills things he begins to see that lifelessness as curious but sad. He doesn't know why he wants to hold, caress and protect the his blond beauty but he does so with vigor. Of course the American shoot at what they don't understand, and don't care about the culture they are overrunning in their efforts to make a popular film that will make them rich and famous. yet it is the beast that is driven by love. Hard to miss that. Also hard to watch the film all for the final showmanship line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Golly. Gee. Now who would have ever thought that this 1933 "Monster-On-A-Rampage" movie would still endure and persevere and remain satisfyingly entertaining after all of these many, many years?The truth is, even if you've been totally jaded by contemporary Fantasy/Monster movies, King Kong still manages to hold up surprisingly well, even by today's rigid, CGI-saturated standards.Boy, I'm tellin' ya - There was certainly no lack of over-the-top action in this far-out Fantasy flick. I guess King Kong is what one could confidently call a "classic gem" in the truest sense of the term.I mean, this monster-of-a-monster-movie had just about everything in it that you could ever hope for. Adventure, excitement, thrills, chills, humour, romance, and, yes, even a splash of pathos thrown in for good measure. On all counts, King Kong did not disappoint.And, did I mention brutal violence!?.... Like, Wow! King Kong certainly delivered that on a large scale. Kong's totally peed-off rampage through NYC was, without question, mad movie-style carnage at one of its finest and most frenzied hours.Yes. This movie certainly had its fair share of flaws and 1930's kitsch. But if you keep in mind its movie-history time-line, then you can't help but enjoy its fantastic story from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's little new I can add to the hundreds of reviews for this great film but I will throw in my praise anyway. To start with, let me state the obvious: this is a seminal classic everybody should see. Unless you are the most ignorant wretch there is that can't stand anything made decades before they were born, you have to see this movie at least once. A simple story but told with perfection. Remade, imitated, and outright ripped off countless times but never surpassed.A great cast with Fay Wray's iconic role deservedly well-remembered. The other iconic (human) character in the film is obsessive movie director Carl Denham, played with gusto by Robert Armstrong. Bruce Cabot plays the heroic leading man like nobody's business. This is the best role of his long career. Character actor Frank Reicher doesn't get enough props but his Captain Englehorn is a cool customer. Directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack outdid themselves. Excellent cinematography from Eddie Linden, J.O. Taylor &amp; Vernon Walker that isn't as appreciated as it should be. Willis O'Brien's special effects are appreciated, though all too often the praise for them comes with backhanded compliments and qualifying remarks such as "great for its time." Well, what time was it supposed to be great for -- the year 2058? The sets, the props, the matte backgrounds are all top notch. Max Steiner's legendary score is perfect. Drama, humor, romance, action, fantasy, horror -- it's a film with a little bit of everything. Historically, artistically, and technically its value can't be overstated. It's a classic in every sense of the word. I would put it in my top ten films of all time, perhaps even top five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KING KONG, the mother of all monster movies, is truly a masterpiece of cinema. Sure, it's dated, shot in black and white and featuring a monster made of plasticine who's a lot less believable than the CGI creation in the Peter Jackson 2005 remake, and yet this 1933 original is by far the better film. Why? The reason is that it has everything you could want from cinema: a love story, plenty of adventure, horror, excitement and tragedy. Literally nothing is missed out here, and despite his best efforts Jackson doesn't even come close.In my mind, KING KONG is the first of the blockbuster movies that later became a Hollywood mainstay. The story is truly larger than life and the whiff of the exotic runs through it from beginning to end. Even without Kong, it's a great film, with decent actors giving decent performances and bringing their characters to life. Fay Wray headlines, of course, in the process becoming the most famous scream queen of all time.Kong is inevitably the main attraction and he's a delight. Willis O'Brien's stop-motion is well ahead of its time, and he fills his creation with real character and emotion - not bad when you're working with a lump of clay. The dinosaur fights are great fun, but the real brilliance comes during the city-wide chaos at the climax, which ended up inspiring a whole global genre of destructive monster-fuelled mayhem. And I'm not ashamed to say I still shed a tear during that ending. It's fair to say that both remakes are entirely redundant and pale in comparison to this masterful original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic and excellent action adventure movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentary filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) is going to an uncharted island to shoot a movie. He brings along beautiful but penniless Ann Darrow (Fay Wray). On ship she meets gruff John Driscoll (Bruce Cabot). He hates her at first but they eventually fall in love. They reach the island and the natives there want Ann to be given to Kong--a huge, vicious ape. They refuse so the natives kidnap Ann and give her to Kong. He falls in love with her but Denham, Driscoll and the rest of the crew go to save her.Everybody knows about this by now. The ending with Kong on top of the Empire State Building has become legend and this has been remade twice (the 1976 one was a fiasco and the 2005 was WAY too long). Still nothing can improve on this. It does take it's time getting started but once Kong gets on screen the movie never stops. It's full of action, adventure and is VERY violent. If you've only seen it on TV you probably saw it cut but the DVD that came out years ago is complete. There's blood in the animal fights and we see Kong casually chewing on people or squashing them under foot! Still it's hard to take any of this seriously. Also there's a GREAT score that moves the film quickly. The acting doesn't really matter. All the actors are OK but who watches this for acting? A truly classic movie. A 10 all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong (1933)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm slightly biased in terms of this film, since the 2005 version is the one I've loved since I was about 9. The first thing that struck me about this movie, is how surprisingly similar it actually is to the 2005 version. Overall, I thought this film was well done, and certainly enjoyable to watch. There were a few things that made it a little less pleasant though. I didn't find the cinematography particularly great- not bad but not overwhelmingly amazing either. I also found the characters to be rather unrelatable, and underdeveloped. There was really no one to root for, including Kong (who I love in the other version). I think I have to attribute this to the fact that he is not convincing at all- although technically its well done for the time period, so I don't want to complain too much about that. Oh and one more thing: the constant shrieking in this film really got on my nerves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong - the eighth wonder of the world!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong (the eighth wonder of the world) is a sensational film. It is one of the few films that I can say was truly brilliant from start to finish. It is a fairly short film so it doesn't take long for the film to get going;We begin with Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) who is looking for a female lead role for an up and coming film that he is making. He's quite specific in his requirements - she must be young, blonde and pretty. After some difficulty finding a suitable lead, he bumps into Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) after she tries to steal an apple from a grocer's stand. Denham pays the grocer off and then tells Ann that he would like her to take the lead role in the film that he's making. As Ann is currently down on her luck, she jumps at the chance and Denham and his crew set sail with Ann in tow to the filming location which is a mysterious island to begin making his film. All doesn't go to plan when natives on the island kidnap Ann and offer her as a sacrifice for one of their own women. Kong takes a shine to Ann and will do everything in his power to protect her, of course that also means that he keeps a grip on her at all times making an escape from him impossible for Ann. Once Ann is in Kong's grasp, it's down to Denham and the crew to try and rescue her.So what is it that makes this 1933 version of Kong so great?. Firstly, the score is fantastic and I felt that it helped increase the tension. Secondly, although the plot is basic, it is still compelling and interesting. The film will keep you on the edge of your seat as a 'cat and mouse' game ensues on skull mountain between Driscoll - Ann's love interest(portrayed by Bruce Cabot) and Kong. Skull Mountain is a frightening place and Kong isn't the only beast to inhabit the island and the crew come across a couple of other nasty beasts whilst attempting to rescue Ann. Kong has his own troubles with them too. Thirdly, the film has also aged pretty well considering it is now 80 years old; the use of 'stop motion' technology which they used for Kong is still used today (admittedly CGI is used more commonly), but nevertheless the technology used in this film is still being used today. Whilst the special effects are much better in Jackson's 2005 version we need to remember that this original film was released in 1933 and back then the effects used in this film would have probably been the best available at the time (remember there was no CGI in 1933). The 1933 version is very much a product of its time.The only minor gripes I have with this film are that the character development wasn't great (that's the only downside to advancing the story at such a fast rate). Fay Wray's screaming may also get on your nerves a bit - but that can be easily remedied by turning the volume down slightly for those moments. Despite the minor flaws, this is still an excellent film that is most definitely worth 100 minutes of your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"King Kong" is one of those films that becomes harder to shrug off the more you see it. The tricks of 1933 may be easier to spot, but the more you look, the more you find to draw you in.There is the topsy-turvy emotional ride, of watching a gigantic beast inflict terrible carnage while finding yourself pulling for him. There is the sharp social commentary of civilization pushing its luck by imagining itself lord and master of what it doesn't understand. There's the meta-humor of the main human character, Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), who motivated not by greed or lust but a showman's pride, can't stop himself from pushing his luck, or that of others."Keep your chin up," he keeps telling the girl he brings along for a mysterious cruise, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray). Before the show is over, her chin will be up alright - 102 stories up to be exact.Fay Wray would go down as one of filmdom's best screamers, but she's an even better writher, whether in a diaphanous gown or tied to a pair of posts. The horror sustains even better today than the sex appeal: Scenes of Kong pulling off the limbs of captured sailors, or casually dropping a woman from a tall building, still retain their jaw-dropping power.Directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack along with the main writer, Schoedsack's wife Ruth Rose, create a story that develops nicely, almost leisurely, and then bursts into a fast run once Denham makes landfall at Skull Island. {At least that's how it's come to be known; no one calls it that in the movie.} You get enough information to care about Denham despite his understandable "reputation for recklessness," while Darrow's feisty charm and bravery presents us with a central character in such an economical fashion we hardly notice her being worked into the center of our notice.Then Kong enters the picture, and after that it's one big thrill scene after another, each seemingly starting before the last scene ends, all stitched together wonderfully by the perils of Ann and the way Kong, like Denham, takes a sudden, unnatural, but somehow heartening interest in her. If you are watching at home and plan on any bathroom breaks or food runs, you better not wait too long, or you won't find a spot to take your pause. The film moves so fast, and yet so assuredly, it's easy to forget how difficult it is to make it seem so natural.If there's one thing I'd change about this film, it's that the originally-cast Joel McCrea play the part of the first mate, Driscoll, instead of the game-but-dishwatery Bruce Cabot. Though to be fair to Cabot, he's got one heck of a romantic rival to play off of.Otherwise, "Kong" has everything you want: A sonorous yet lush score by Max Steiner, set designs that recall the fantasy jungle-scapes of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard, a dazzling meshing of multiple special-effect types that become doubly impressive once we leave Skull Island for Manhattan. Watching this on Blu-Ray only makes the spectacle more outstanding: Imagine being inside the cockpit of a biplane as it flies toward the Empire State Building, only now for the first time you notice the Chrysler Building reaching up at you nearly as fast.Is "Kong" a nostalgia trip, for those of us who want to imagine what it was like back when? Sure. But it's also a gripping adventure yarn with a lot of clever threads interwoven."I'm going out and making the greatest picture in the world," Denham says at the start. "Something nobody's ever seen or heard of." Mission accomplished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When King Kong came out in 2005 and I watched it, I thought wow, that was an awesome movie. A tad depressing by the end but still fantastic. But when I had to watch it for my class I realized holy cow, it is a hell of a lot more intense watching the first version. I had to watch it twice to get all the detail and I would not watch it twice if it was not absolutely amazing. The use of the visual effects and the music was brilliant, it captivated you and brought you to another dimension and you kind of left your reality behind. At first, I was skeptical to watch it because of the 2005 version but I soon realized that was a stupid thing to think about, even though its really old and does not have all the fancy graphics of today the original version, of any film in my opinion, is always better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie producer Robert Armstrong (as Carl Denham) needs a female lead for his upcoming adventure film. On the streets of New York, he finds beautiful actress Fay Wray (as Ann Darrow). In desperate need of funds, Ms. Wray accepts the role, although it means traveling to exotic and dangerous "Skull Island". Aboard ship, Wray arouses the male crew, and finds herself turned on by handsome first mate Bruce Cabot (as John "Jack" Driscoll). The expedition discovers the giant gorilla "King Kong" presiding over native worshipers, dinosaurs and other assorted beasts. They decide to bring "Kong" back to New York City as exhibit...While sometimes prehistoric, the special effects herein still excite. What works best is "King Kong" himself; the creature remains, after all these years, a marvelous (and sympathetic) creation. Attempts to re-make this film have failed to capture the original beast's unique visual and imbued personality; after all these years, it may not be possible. Merian Cooper, Ernest Schoedsack, Willis O'Brien and the RKO team are primal. Occasionally braless, Wray is screamingly sexy. The bestiality angle peaks when Kong fondles Wray and sniffs her clothing. You can read much into this relationship, and it's wisely kept in the realm of fantasy.********** King Kong (3/7/33) Merian C. Cooper, Ernest B.

		<fullReview>An adventurous film producer named Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) follows a map to a mysterious island where prehistoric monsters still roam and a giant ape rules the jungle.This is the film that made Fay Wray a known name... though I cannot tell you anything else she ever appeared in. (Okay, she was in "Doctor X", "Vampire Bat" and "Most Dangerous Game".) Ivan Butler calls her "the perfect heroine". Howard Maxford refers to her as "the genre's greatest screamer".Although "King Kong" is the most famous of the prehistoric monster movies (unless you count "Jurassic Park"), it was not the first. One might want to check out 1925's "The Lost World", a film based off of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's dinosaur book. (There was also an abandoned dinosaur film, "Creation", in 1930, and Kong's creator, Willis O'Brien, had stop-motioned a brontosaurus in 1914's "The Dinosaur and the Missing Link".) Quite simply, this film is a must-see for any horror fan. The methods are rudimentary, but epic in their time... this is the work that inspired Ray Harryhausen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The King Still Reigns Supreme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"King Kong" is one of those rare films that just gets better and better with age. This is because we watch it now as a 1930's fable that has transcended its own time and has become an American myth. The undiminished, primordial energy it continues to generate derives from all aspects of production; from Willis O'Brien's masterly stop-motion animation and Murray Spivack's innovative early sound mix, to Max Steiner's brilliantly evocative, operatic music score.The performances as well are in perfect sync with the larger than life premise of this adventure/fairy tale classic. Fay Wray's iconic portrayal of the Beauty who kills the Beast set the standard for every damsel in distress that followed, and her lusty screams are the female equivalent of Johnny Weismuller's celebrated Tarzan yell. Most amazing of all is Kong himself, who projects such a distinctive personality that we willingly dismiss the fact that he is only a visual effect. Who can forget those expressive, blinking eyes of his at the hotel window when he recognizes Fay Wray?But even beyond all the indelible imagery, the film also rates high marks for its wholly original screenplay, which has a subtext that is based on the real life experiences shared by producers Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack in making expeditionary films. This essential, autobiographical approach drives the first third of "King Kong" and serves effectively as build-up to the wild fantasy that ultimately takes over. The film is as much a personal work from its creators as is anything by Erich Von Stroheim or Charlie Chaplin, and this explains in part why the remakes fall far short of the original. Consider: The "Old Arabian Proverb" following the opening credits was written by Cooper, the character of Carl Denham (played with appropriate 30's style, two fisted gusto by Robert Armstrong) was fashioned after Cooper, the girl shy first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot in a rare heroic turn), was based on Schoedsack, and the pilots machine gunning Kong in that famous, fantastic finale atop the newly built Empire State Building are actually Cooper and Schoedsack.Besides presenting an allegory on the destructive power of both unrequited love and modern civilization, "King Kong" interweaves fact and fiction with such clever subtlety that audiences are, perhaps, still largely unappreciative of this unique aspect of the film. While the narrative is ostensibly simple, there's a lot more under the surface that penetrates our subconscious, and a closer examination reveals some intriguing parallels and timeless themes that go beyond social/cultural boundaries. It's simply a great, shrewdly conceived piece of escapist entertainment that endures, inviting us back for repeated viewings so that when all is said and done, we realize that there is really only one Kong. Long live the King!</fullReview>

So, Uncle John switched off the lights and the next thing I knew I was transported into the land of yesteryear. Naturally being a kid, the beginning of the film was hard to get through but.., when they hit that island, all perdition broke loose with Kong, dinosaurs, all those poor slobs that Kong knocks off that fallen tree laying across a canyon, what a ride. Well, there have been two remakes, one by that Italian guy and the other by ah, what's his name, you know, the guy who did those three hobbit movies, oh well, names aren't important. We can send a man to moon, perform heart transplants and turn weight loss into a multi-million dollar business, but no film maker thus far has done the original King Kong justice.

		<fullReview>King Kong is an undeniable classic. The story is well known, a group of sailors and filmmakers go to Skull Island and end up meeting up with a primitive tribe and seeing a lot pre-historic creatures and they capture the biggest and baddest of them all, a giant gorilla called Kong. They take Kong to New York where he escapes and runs amok, before climbing up the Empire State Building and is killed by biplanes.The film starts with Carl Denham planning on making a film on the mysterious island but losses his leading lady before sailing off. He meets a woman, Ann Darrow, who tries to steal an apple and asks her to be in the film. Whilst sailing to the island Ann starts to develop feeling for the ship's first mate Jack Driscoll, who is really just an robot. When they make it to the island the tribe kidnaps Ann and make her a sacrifice to Kong. The sailors, led by Jack set off to save her, whilst Carl films it all. After saving her they capture the gorilla and take him to New York, however, he had fallen in love with Ann and kidnaps her once again. As well as the story involving Kong, there is a love story between Ann and Jack. As I said, Jack does seem a bit emotionally dead, but Fay Wray was very good as Ann and this film is her most famous role. Carl is shown as an ambitious man, but not morally bankrupt as in the Peter Jackson remake and was a likable character. The love between Ann and Kong is only one way, Kong loves Ann but Ann was afraid of the gorilla and only loved Jack.What makes the film really great is the stop-motion animation mixed with live action film-making, which was revolutionary for the time. The stop-motion was also very good and well done, this was the best special effects that was available for the time. I personally really like it for that level as well.The film can also be seen as a morality tales, not to interfere with nature and not to take something out of its natural environment. In the film you do feel sorry for Kong and he is the real star of the film.King Kong is a very influential, especially for monster movies. It is a classic. The Peter Jackson remake is very good, but I still have a place in my heart for this film. It is also a short film, only an hour and a half which I think works. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so popular even today. But everyone says it sucks. But who cares, I like apes and dinosaurs. This movie has umph with great special effects by Willis Harold O'Brien, and Buz Gibson. Which 13 months of animating the title beast.The film has two morals: Never send wild animals to civilization. And Show business is a major waste of time! This film taught me those two lessons, and I learned how to make stop-motion, and taught me to look for something no one has ever seen nor heard of.It go re-released in the late 30's, 40's, and early 50's. There were numerous imitations in various movies and T.V. shows. About the 1976 version, it lost all the charm of the original.SON OF KONG on the other hand, didn't make Willis O'Brien happy, because it lost all the charm of the original. So after making MIGHTY JOE YOUNG, he wrote the script and came up with the idea for a sequel shot in color called KING KONG VS. FRANKENSTEIN. The Frankenstein monster was made out of bits and pieces of various parts of African animals, and it was called the Ginkgo. San Francisco gets trashed in this unmade film. So we end up with various films that involved various elements of that unmade film.This movie is a combo between THE LOST WORLD, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and INGAGI all crammed into one epic that took America by storm in 1933. At the time I was born they put a big balloon of Kong on the Empire state Building.It is amazing how special effects change over the years. From stop-motion and puppetry, to men in suits and big robots, to computer animation and animatronics. I don't know what to say but I love this movie. It's my favorite!</fullReview>

We had football, baseball, hockey, ice skating and other outdoor sports but "going to the movies" beat out a lot of things. And that was before black and white T.V's let alone vcr's and beyond. So when we announced to mother that we wanted to see King Kong she balked. Not only was it playing at a movie house not in our neighborhood but her main concern was the subject matter. Heck, she even allowed us to see Waterloo Bridge but when a lady friend asked her if she should let us go to see the film mother wisely said "they won't know what their looking at." Waterloo Bridge was about a dancer who turned to prostitution after she thought her lover was killed. Still mother was worried about our seeing King Kong, we wheedled and begged and promised to come "straight home" until she finally submitted. The matine was packed with noisy but well behaved kids who was anticipating the start of the movie, needless to say the theater quited down when the film started and we as one were glued to the big screen. You are caught up in the adventures of King Kong and the crew and are enthralled up to the very end of the film. At that time in life when you bought a ticket to a movie house you could stay for one or several showings but of course we had to get home as mother knew the show times and we promised anyway. After showing just a small segment to the brass at RKO King Kong was given a budget of $500,000, a sizable amount in the middle of the Great Depression. It took over a year to complete because of the stop-action sequences that were crucial to it. The filming took so long that another movie was made at the same time using most of King Kong sets the movie was called The Most Dangerous Game, a gem in it's own right that has been filmed several times but not equaled the original. When King Kong was finally released it's final cost rose to $672,000 but grossed over $2 Million dollars during it's first release in 1933. The original King Kong is a cinema classic. It will live forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kong reigns supreme in classic original: awesome and timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid growing up in the Sixties, I saw all of the classic horror pictures on television. They ranged from between twenty to thirty years old at that time. It's startling to realize that many of these same movies are now over seventy years old.I was a devoted reader of the magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland, and learned much about the classic horror movies from it. It was always a thrill to me to see an old movie that was brand new to me. For this reason, I am always stunned into silence when someone younger says something to the effect of " I won't watch anything that's in black and white." I first saw King Kong about the age of nine or ten, and was completely enthralled by its gripping story telling ,and hair raising adventure. Kong himself is truly a character, not just a special effect. I was so taken with the story, that it was only years later, after countless viewings, that I began to appreciate the craft and dedication that had gone into making the film. When I read about the painstaking work of Willis O'Brien and his crew, the months of patient labor, that often yielded only a few feet of film a day, I was awed and amazed by the true labor of love that the movie was for its creators.The thing that has always fascinated me about King Kong is that it is unmistakably a product of the times when it was made, the great Depression of the Thirties. Just the scene of Carl Denham searching through breadlines and charity missions to find a woman to play his leading lady ,tells much about the grim real life background of the fantastic story. I don't think it would have been the same film if made at any time before or after 1933.And yet, Kong's eternal appeal is the basic story, which transcends the passage of years. The Beauty and the Beast theme will never cease to intrigue and move audiences, and Kong himself will remain, for all his brutality and ferocity, a tragic character, whose lonely death can still bring forth tears from any audience. This film is a masterpiece, and an unforgettable experience for any viewer, young or old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest science fiction classics. Immortal. 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie more every time I see it. A fantastical adventure to an uncharted island with prehistoric creatures! Giant ape runs amok in New York City! Friends, it doesn't get much better than this. Outstanding special effects -- a true achievement for the time it was made. The creators of this movie were among the first to make a movie like this and they did it right with King Kong. King Kong is a BADASS and he knows it. He fights dinosaurs and takes names! There is quite a bit of realistic violence in this movie which I think must have been groundbreaking for the 1930's. Kong smashes people into the mud and throws people into canyons in all the gory detail. Kong kicks quite a bit of butt. But invaders from a different world invade Kong's island and pretty much ruin it for Kong and the inhabitants of the island. Terror ensues as the giant ape is unwisely transported to New York City as a circus show. Kong is King of his world, but alas, not of the modern world. Really exciting and entertaining adventure / sci-fi classic. As of this writing, you have had 73 years to see it, so if you haven't seen it by now - GO WATCH IT !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did you ever hear of...Kong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No-one who watches this film will ever forget the presence of 'King Kong', that mighty ape who is more sympathetic than truly frightening. This film was astonishing for it's time, and still is, to this day. There is something so gloriously wonderful about the obviously fake Kong, the cut-out scenery, the creaky reptiles. Nothing approaching realism here, and that's what makes the 1933 version so great. It's a fantasy, it's not real-life.Fay Wray is sexy as Ann Darrow, a young woman handpicked to star in movie director's Carl Denham's next feature. Denham himself is striving for realism in his work, and takes his film crew to a far-away island near Sumatra, to capture scenes of the natives and the mythical Kong. Things go horribly wrong when, upon landing, the natives spy the golden blonde, expressing their wish to take her for Kong's bride. The crew retreat, but Ann, alone on the boat's deck and overjoyed by her new lover Jack, is kidnapped later. She is offered to Kong, who tramples off into the distance with his new, screaming play-toy.The acting is very wooden and stand-and-deliver, but it's the special effects and monsters we love, so it doesn't really impact the production. Wray's Ann is the typical blonde damsel-in-distress, but her lungs are given a good work-out in a screamer of a performance. If an Academy Award was given for best use of sheer lung power, Miss Wray would have won it. In this Pre-Code film, Wray's nice figure is emphasized, too. Her ordeal justifies her lack of clothing, and she runs around practically half-naked for most of the film. Some of the shots must have just slipped past the censors, particularly those of her heaving cleavage, long legs, and the swimming scene where she surfaces and temporarily loses the top of her dress. Some good male eye candy, I guess.It's a pity we girls don't get the same treat, with Bruce Cabot proving to be a rather gruff and awkward hero. Kong is more our hero. He protects Ann from the horrible dinosaurs that lurk on the island, and his last rampage is primarily due to his agitation over Ann's safety. Yes, 'Beauty killed the Beast'.Love the foreshadowing, with the pet monkey on board the boat and Denham's speech about 'Beauty' and the 'Beast' to Jack Driscoll. Wonderful action sequences, this must have looked extraordinary to audiences in the Depression-era 30's. Wow. What imagination to dream this one up, particularly the finale with Kong atop the Empire State Building. A sad finish, with Kong's inevitable death, because Kong is not a hated figure. He is more of a tragic hero.More than just an action, 'King Kong' offers interesting discussion. It criticizes society that esteems appearance over true self. It appears to be also criticizes the ethics of film-makers and other artists who strive for realism in their work, effectively manipulating the lives of others (Denham roping Ann into the scheme with promise of riches; Kong being literally roped in with scheme through chains and sedatives)in the process.This early talkie is enthralling.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Ape!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there have been more giant ape films made over the years than any sane person needs (I can think of at least fourteen just off the top of my head), the 1933 King Kong remains the most significant of them, mainly because without Merian C. Cooper &amp; Ernest B. Shoedsack's production, none of the other movies would exist. Peter Jackson's 2005 remake may have better special effects, and it's a fine film, but Jackson himself would be the first to acknowledge his debt to Cooper &amp; Shoedsack.The main reason this movie is still so fondly remember is Willis O'Brien's stop-motion effects, which are still impressive more than seventy years later. While they do look a little jerky in comparison to the fluidity of Peter Jackson's CGI Kong (particularly in the fight scenes with the dinosaurs), the first sighting of Kong, his emergence through the Skull Island gates, and the climactic showdown on top of the Empire State Building are images no one ever forgets. And let's be honest; we'd all rather have O'Brien's slightly jerky eighteen- incher than some nerk in a rubber gorilla suit, wouldn't we? Inevitably, the human stars are overshadowed by their tall, dark, not exactly handsome leading man (or should that be leading ape?), but that's not to say they are bad. Robert Armstrong's Carl Denham is a likable, charismatic individual, the type who can sell you an idea even though you know it's a bad one, and Fay Wray makes for an appealing heroine, defining the term 'scream queen' in style. Bruce Cabot isn't exactly multi-faceted as Jack Driscoll, but he makes a decent fist of the action hero role he is required to play. Some of the racial politics are a little iffy, particularly the stereotypical Chinese cook, who is reduced to comic relief status, and the Skull Island natives, who are portrayed as savages who are mesmerised by the sight of a white woman.These minor niggles aside, King Kong is a great movie, a true spectacle and fully deserving of its iconic status. Shame nobody's been able to find the Spider Pit sequence, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The King of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no movie monster in the history of American cinema that is as iconic as King Kong. He was there (more of less) first, and few other creatures have had his staying power (Japan's Godzilla is the only one that comes close). And while many are most likely familiar with the giant ape and the broad strokes of the film which made him famous, I imagine many modern American audiences have not witnessed the 1933 classic for themselves. Recently released in a restored DVD edition, King Kong displays for all to see it's position in American film history, while at the same time proving that you can be iconic without being outstanding.For those who are unfamiliar with the basics of King Kong, here you go: Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) is a fierce independent filmmaker who has chartered a boat, the Venture, to transport him and his leading lady to a remote island to capture footage of an immense creature believed to be living on the island. When his selected actress backs out at the last minute, Denham stumbles upon Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), a starving girl living on the streets who attempts to steal an apple from a fruit cart to feed herself. Denham is taken with her and convinces her to join him on his adventure of a lifetime. While on board ship in route to the island, Darrow finds her self falling for the ship' first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot). After arriving at their destination, Denham and the crew go ashore and discover the native population living on the island in the midst of a celebration of some type. Retreating to the ship after having been discovered by the tribe, the crew must jump into action when some of the natives kidnap Ann and offer her up as a sacrifice to the great creature that lives on the island, the immensely tall gorilla Kong. Driscoll and the others set out to save Ann, encountering an extensive number of amazing creatures living on the island, while at the same time Kong and Ann are also attacked by dinosaurs among other creatures. Kong has become smitten with Ann, and Driscoll faces a challenge to save her from the beast and avoid being killed himself.Driscoll is able to save her and Denham manages to use gas bombs to capture Kong himself, with the intention of bringing him back to New York and promoting him as a major attraction to the public. But things go horribly wrong at Kong's public unveiling, and he escapes, wreaking havoc in the city in search of his beloved Ann.King Kong is well remembered for several things: it's impressive (especially for the time) stop-motion animation, executed by one of the innovators of the technique, Willis O'Brien. It is also known for several of it's set pieces, including Kong's fight with a Tyrannosaurus Rex and, of course, most famously, his fight to the death with biplanes while clinging to the Empire State Building at the film's conclusion. These are classic images that are instilled in many a individual's memory. However, the film surrounding many of these moments has not stood the test of time perfectly. Admittedly, King Kong was a medium budgeted film from one of Hollywood's second-tier studios, RKO, so the quality of other aspects of the production can't really be expected to be up to snuff compared to Hollywood's golden era masterpieces. For what it's worth, the acting is passable, but definitely not refined or polished. Many of the performances are wooden at times, most especially Bruce Cabot's. Robert Armstrong varies from scene to scene, but he makes an impression as adventurous filmmaker Denham (For those even slightly familiar with the real life of producer-director Merian C. Cooper, you can see the autobiographical nature of Denham representing Cooper). The characters in the film are also mostly one-dimensional. Ann Darrow is there to look pretty and scream, not much else. Jack Driscoll talks tough and saves the girl. The two fall in love, according to the screenplay, but there is no chemistry or spark between the two, it's all just background filler to motivate scenes later in the picture.But you aren't watching to see the Jack and Ann show, no, you are here for Kong, and in this department, the film does not disappoint. While modern advances in visual effects are flashy, the achievements of King Kong are simply breathtaking. Kong is a living, breathing character in this film, full of mannerisms and interesting tics of behavior (After having killed a Tyrannosaurus Rex, he plays with the creatures broken jaw, as if uncertain why it has stopped moving). When he is facing down the planes at the end of the film, we feel a strong twinge of sadness as he fights against what is inevitable. Kong has often been referred to as the only real character in the film, and I can't disagree with that. Production value wise, King Kong is a marvel, with impressive scenes in the jungle and New York, with an immense attention to detail obviously on display in the film, showing that even with the limitations of the time, artistry of the highest order could still be achieved.If you have even a passing interest in film history, King Kong is required viewing, and for audiences looking for a example of a time in Hollywood when the craftsmanship of a few men created indelible imagery, you owe it to yourself to see this film. It has earned it's place in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is virtually nothing I can say here that has not been said before.King Kong is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, and, over 70 years later, still holds up well by today's standards.I first saw the film in 1975(or was it 1974?) as a kid, and it is still one of my favourite movies.Perhaps my favourite scene in the movie is the scene where Kong fights the tyranosaurus. After a long and hard battle, Kong rips the tyranosaur's jaw off, killing it, then, as if confused by his adversary's sudden lifelessnes, Kong starts opening and closing the dead tyranosaur's jaw to make it mimic what it was like only moments before in life.Fantastic.This is one of those scenes where, as a kid, you often find yourself excitedly shadow boxing along with the action without realizing you are doing it.This same scene was in the 2005 version of Kong by Peter Jackson, but was not nearly as good. The Jackson version of this scene has, instead of one, three tyranosaurs, and actually has Kong juggling Anne from hand to hand to foot, with some outrageous acrobatics and other over the top fighting, but it goes on way too long, and just doesn't create the same excitement that the original fight has.As much as I enjoyed Peter Jackson's new version of Kong, it is still not quite as good as the original 1933 thriller. In my mind at least, the original still reigns supreme.Long Live the King!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny, as a kid I focused on the wrap up to this movie and missed the stuff that went before. Now I think the beginning is the best part of the film...Armstrong travels to barely-charted waters in hopes of filming Wray in mock mortal danger. You have to be careful what you wish for, because Wray is stolen by tribe intent on sacrificing her to monster gorilla Kong. After losing much of the crew to Kong and other prehistoric denizens of the island, Armstrong is able to capture Kong and bring him back to NYC and immortality.Wray fits the B movie heroine to a "T" and at times is breathtakingly beautiful. Armstrong is equally effective as the driven movie maker. I still find much of the special effects compelling despite the advances that have been made. When you look at the leap this movie made over what came before it, it may be the best of all-time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning special effects for its time, Kong steals the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'King Kong' (1993) is a film that is more about special effects than it is a story. Yes, there is a story, but the story is weak and fully consists of a film director going to a secret island with the hopes of making a film about Kong. King Kong and the special effects steal the show, and the story could not survive on its own and without some stunning visual effects. (By today's standards, the special effects may not look the best, but I think they were done extremely well for its time. I also read somewhere that the music played a very important part in this film, and when the film is played without music or without the right type of music, the audience did not take the film seriously.) This film has been so successful that a couple remakes have been made, and it has spawned a few video games. The scene where Kong climbs the Empire State Building is probably one of the most memorable and classic moments in cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so everyone knows this father-of-all monster movies, so I'll just talk about a few aspects. Fay Wray is HOT, HOT, HOT!!! I bet that the title character's sex drive must have really gotten going once he laid eyes on that babe (well duh; why do you think that he pulled her clothes off?). Every second that she's on the screen, you just gotta wonder how she looks under that dress.I guess that overall, the movie is looking at the problems with all societies: we try to take someone/something out of its normal habitat and expect no trouble once we displace it. It seems that we still haven't learned our lesson. As it is, we used to be wild, but the creation of societies has messed everything up.Obviously, the 1976 version has as its main strength making a star out of Jessica Lange; otherwise, it was kind of silly. I intend to see Peter Jackson's version soon.And once again, Fay Wray is one hot chick, especially when she falls into the water wearing a skimpy dress. I bet that Bruce Cabot and Robert Armstrong liked being on the set with her; I would have liked it. Hubba hubba. All in all, "King Kong" will rule forever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film may be old, but it still remains to be one of the most creative and original monster movies ever made! It still amazes me when I watch the film, even after the recent release of Jackson's 'King Kong' remake! The effects are still brilliant, and there are no flaws, no flaws at all! The ape looks awesome, the acting is brilliant, and the film is so well made! The most clever part of the film is the great synchronisation of live action with the stop motion animation, it must have taken them ages to get it right! and to achieve such a great result! The story follows a film crew, lead by director Carl Denham (Armstrong), who's hell-bent on making his film, and featuring in it the giant ape Kong, but Denham is unaware that Kong is not ready to be used as an extra in a film! After a rather un-exciting first day of filming, when the natives of the island discover the film crew, and don't seem to want them there, the crew return to the ship. But that night the natives sneak aboard the crew's ship, and capture Ann, with plans to use her as a sacrifice to the legendary Kong. A search and rescue team, lead by Jack Driscoll (Cabot) and Denham set out into the forest of Skull Island to try and retrieve Ann. The team run into things like a Stegosaurus, and a large carnivorous Brontosaurus (not their real name, but 'meh'), then they run into Kong, who's waiting to spill some blood for his bride. When Ann is rescued, Kong is captured and brought back to New York to be shown to the world. But after the press drive Kong mad, he escapes and causes disaster and a lot of people's death! Then at the end the famous Empire State Building, which is still a land-mark scene for these days of film-making! The film never gets old, it will remain a classic and a very respectable one! You MUST see this film, is the land-mark for all modern day film-making! And you have to see it before seeing Jackson's new 2005 remake, so you can point out all the homages in the 2005 version! 10/10! A brilliant movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film-producer heads to an isolated island where it's rumoured a giant ape roams. When they reached the island, the natives want to use his blonde actress as a sacrificial item to please the beast, by becoming its bride. But no deal is made, but later that night she is kidnapped from the ship and is given to Kong. So now the captain and crew head into the jungle to get the lady back, but the filmmaker sees big dollars in this beast and decides to capture it to and bring it back to New York to become famous. But the ape escapes and runs amuck in New York, trying to find the woman that he adores so much.It's dreadful!? that I can't give this milestone no more than a 10. Simply the greatest monster film of them all, no doubt about it! Shame on me, because I haven't watched it for yonks, presumably 10 years. So damn, what took me so long to do so!? Obviously this piece has gone on to provide many imitators, such as a sequel, two remakes, 'Mighty Joe Young', 'Godzilla' and even to a extend 'Jurassic Park', but nothing has over thrown this king of the monsters, or "the eighth wonder of the world". Something about this production and art is purely magical, from its upbeat tempo to its clever trick work, there's hardly any road bumps stopping your imagination from going wild and enjoying the miracles of film-making. Simply this breathtaking experience is unforgettably astonishing! I've harped on enough about its total greatness, but I think I should state the reasons why this is held so high, especially in my regards.First off this talkie just breathes life and has an underlying excitement within its material and the big star 'Kong'. The stop motion effects are totally stunning and technically the film looks first rate for its time, especially that of the close ups of Kong, which seem to add a touching personality to the lovesick beast. Actually, come to think of it the grinning close ups of Kong reminded me of one of my old friends; there's just a real uncanniness there. It's those eyes! Err; I don't know if that's a good or bad thing for him? Uh, back to the film I go. The special effects and well-sustained cinematography surely were an inspiration for future projects. The epic story is basically a tragic love tale between beauty and beast, with the incredibly alluring Fray Wray screaming her lungs off and looking pretty while Kong was facing a lot of pests and having to endure Wray's screaming too. But when the big fella hit's the screen for the first time, it's one of the most memorable moments in cinema history and that also includes the fight with the T-Rex and the well known climatic Empire state building set-up. Also when Kong first appears the pace picks up and the excitement levels never faults.Suspense, action, romance, drama and King Kong, that's what this adventure boasts and it's powerful in its execution of these aspects. Really this could've turned into a comedy, but they played it straight and it work out better that way. Hey, that's not to say there are no laughs, because there are spots of humour worked in effectively. I loved the moments when Kong used people as toothpicks and shows off his pearly whites. Also helping you keep right in it is that the slow-burn suspense has taut editing that contributed to its brisk pace and the score races along smoothly. The performances are solid even if there's one reasonably deadpan one (Bruce Cabot), and those who did stand out were Fray Wray and Robert Armstrong as the fanatic filmmaker Carl Denham. His performance added a whole lot life to proceedings. If there's one weakness, it would be the script, which had some unbearably dodgy lines they make you snicker, especially that involving the forced romance between John 'Jack' Driscoll and Ann Darrow. The script could do with a twinkle, but the final dialog is a fitting way to end the flick. What makes 'King Kong' a winner is that you truly feel sorry for the misunderstood ape, as he is no real beast but a sensitive victim of a relationship that no boundaries can stop. After 72 years this iconic film is still grand entertainment and the definite monster feature, which has heart! In all a huge triumphant and movie treasure that's a marvel and everyone should see. It's worth the buzz!</fullReview>

Fay Wray put up a fine performance playing the "damsel in distress". King Kong seem to have a way with blondes. I guess any other woman is either a snack or big pesky bug to him. What wonders never cease. King Kong was a fierce fighter, and all of the prehistoric creatures don't stand a chance against this hulking primate. The T-Rex gets his jaw snapped, the pterodactyl is a snack, and all the other creatures just need to stand out of his way. When he ran amok in New York, the word "it's a jungle out there" is nothing but an understatement. The concrete jungle will become a a vast wasteland when Kong is out there. This movie to me is the original "Beauty and the Beast" and there are spoofs later on in time inspiring this movie. This is the ultimate original; go check it out, it won't drive you bananas! 5 stars!</fullReview>

Therefore, I will briefly state the following.The 1933 "King Kong" is not polished, not sophisticated, and not intellectually profound.However, it is dynamic, engrossing, suspenseful, charming, powerful, and poignant.It illuminates the eternal "MAN/BEAST" dichotomy, incongruency, and conflict.In other words, the (as of this writing) 72-year-old "King Kong" is immortal. Not many movies are.One more observation: I always get a kick out this dialogue exchange on the ship Venture between first mate Jack Driscoll and Captain Englehorn:Jack: Is he (i.e. Carl Denham) crazy?Englehorn: No, just enthusiastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still thrilling and moving after all these years,the greatest of all giant monster movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all these years,this still remains the best of all giant monster movies. Despite being made in 1933,there is something about King Kong which is still extremely enthralling. Of course some of the acting and effects seem quaint now,but most people who watch this to jeer end up being thrilled and even moved.The first 25 minutes is indeed slow and it is in this section where the sometimes stiff acting and dialogue is most prominent. A romantic interlude seems almost deliberately wooden and corny,the better to highlight the relentless action of the rest of the film. However,from the moment our heroine is abducted and sacrificed to Kong,the film, becomes an almost non-stop series of thrilling scenes. Kong's appearance,Kong battling various prehistoric monsters,Kong shaking men off a log into a chasm,Kong destroying the native village,Kong destroying a train in New York,Kong on the Empire State Building,etc.... The iconic Empire State Building climax remains great,but it's really the scenes on Skull Island which are the best. The jungle sets have a hallucinatory quality and Kong's battle with a Tyrannosaurus remains thrilling despite scores of Godzilla movies.Yes,the effects look a bit dated but I will go out on a limb and say that the stop motion creatures are as realistic as any CGI creation. No matter how good,CGI will never look totally real because it isn't. Some matte shots do look horrid but this IS 1933,and the attention to detail is astonishing,check out Kong's moving hair. What is even more striking though,is the brutality. People are trampled on,eaten,in one case picked up and than thrown to the ground,there remains a vicious edge to this movie that helps it hold up today.Despite all this,the 'Beauty and the Beast' element of the story,which is indeed absurd {giant ape falls for human female},still generates pathos. When Kong picks up 'Ann' and starts to pull off her clothes,it's slightly perverse and a little amusing,but the film dares us to care about the relationship,and we do.Composer Max Steiner's silent movie-type scoring suits the subject,the film would work considerably less well without it,even if that kind of scoring dates badly now. Many people over the years have read things into King Kong {it's a Freudian sex fantasy,an allegory of racism,etc.},but it's really just one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. There aren't many films of a similar vintage which can still hold a modern audience like this one. Peter Jackson will find it hard to beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and the Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVE this original. I love that they had a brontosaurus eating someone (after emerging from UNDER the water). I love that the T-Rex is hokey and Pokey-ish. I love that the native baby sitting on the ground when Kong attacks has a WILD "afro." I love that the natives all sounded like they were from the south side of Chicago (beneath the foreign dialect, of course). I even love that Kong himself wasn't quite as well done as the Bumble from Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer. It's GREAT! I even loved that when they approached the natives, Carl Denham attempts to hide nine people behind one tuft of pampas grass and, instead of shooting THROUGH that grass, he tries shooting right there in the (obvious) roadway (although there were no cars). It's been said (yes by me, as well) that with the most recent rash of remakes and remixes, Hollywood has become stagnant. Do they not understand that Hollywood has always believed in remakes? Remakes have been the bread and butter of this industry since the beginning. Every time someone does a presentation of "King Lear," it's a remake. (If any of the information posted below is incorrect, I'll count on some trusty IMDb poster to correct the dates.)In 1931, Universal began a project entirely centered around older movies. Their remakes are considered the "originals," yet you have but to look for yourself to see that the 1931 version of Dracula was, in fact, a remake. As was Frankenstein (first done on film in 1910 in the form of a short), the Wolf Man (first done in 1915), the Mummy (also from a short, this time from 1911) and on, and on. RKO did the 1933 version of King Kong; the beloved classic. And now, Universal's doing what it's always done. It's remaking it. Edgar Wallace, whose novels and stories have been committed to film for decades now, was the principal writer of this epic tale of savagery. Merian C. Cooper also wrote this story (along with Wallace), produced and directed the original 1933 work, and flew the plane which killed the beast, in that same work. So as a 1933 RKO production, this movie had the novelty of being new, fresh; a work which had never been given to the public in any form before. Save for one. Beauty and the Beast, first committed to film as far as I can tell, in 1899. So King Kong was just a new spin on a much older tale, which is fine by me.This masterpiece of 1930's film-making rates an 8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When beauty killed the beast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic fantasy/monster on the rampage film has ambitious film crew sailing to an island, finding a giant mythical ape, King Kong, whom the natives try to sacrifice starlet Fay Wray to. After killing a number of day players and stop motion dinosaurs, Fay is rescued by Bruce Cabot and Kong pursues them, madly in love with Fay. Kong is subdued by a gas bomb and hauled back to America to be exploited for all he's worth. Kong, our misunderstood hero, escapes, captures Fay and climbs the Empire State Building, trying to be king of New York, only to be tragically gunned down by an unsympathetic society that just doesn't understand him. In the end, the only one who feels for the fallen ape king is the director who intended to exploit him, who overlooks Kong's death with the classic line "It wasn't the airplanes... it was beauty killed the beast." That sums up the character flaw of Kong: he was a mighty force to be reckoned with, but falling in love did him in.The tale of King Kong was remade in 1976 starring Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange as a more sympathetic pair of main characters who were more forgiving of Kong than their 1933 counterparts. Kong was captured by an oilman who also intended to exploit him for all he was worth, even dressed him up in a silly crown. The 1976 Kong fell from the now deceased World Trade Center, was revived in 1986 so he could mate and have a son, and that was the last appearance to be made by Kong. The 1976 version was surprisingly dull and boring for a bigger budgeted film, the only fight on the island being between Kong and a giant snake. Kong remained a sympathetic beast, but the follow up films surrounding him didn't do him justice.Kong also had a brief tenure at Toho studios in Japan, which made the Godzilla films. His other famous film credit includes duking it out with Godzilla in "King Kong VS Godzilla", which was badly edited for the American release. He also fought a robot Kong, kind of like the robot Godzilla that showed up in the 70s.So what is it that makes Kong so charismatic? Well, perhaps it's because Kong is powerful but not invincible, because he's a flawed and tragic hero, or maybe becuase the story of Kong is a morality tale, an early "don't mess with mother nature" kind of story. Or maybe it's just fun to fantasize about a giant ape rampaging through New York. 1933 audiences certainly loved the idea, because to them it wasn't just a giant ape on the rampage: it was a message of standing up against the powers that be.If Peter Jackson succeeds in remaking this, let's hope he does a better job than the 1976 crew did, or the crew of the "Mighty Joe Young Remake" did, or the American Godzilla film. It'll be interesting to see how a CGI Kong measures up to the stop motion Kong of 1933 and the alleged giant robot with ape suits used in 1976.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has thrill! It has a beauty! It has a beast! It will make you scream! King Kong from 1933 is a mother of all monster movies. Kong is a giant ape who causes disaster in the jungle and in New York. This horror classic is directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack and the actors are first class. Robert Armstrong (1890-1973) plays Carl Denham, who has an honor to end this movie with one of the most legendary lines in movie history "it was beauty killed the beast." Fay Wray plays Ann Darrow, the beauty of the movie. She is just glorious! Today this actress is 96 years old and is still very well remembered as The Queen of Scream. The movie is filled with unbelievable scenes. The last scenes at the Empire State Building are pure magic. It has been 70 years since this movie was made. And sure it has aged in that time. The special effects don't look so amazing in our day than they did back then. But it shouldn't matter. It's the story that should matter. And in King Kong the story is something really special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Particularly bearing in mind that this film is nearly 70 years old, i was stunned. Ok, the scenes with the dinosaurs on skull island were a little cheesy (I loved them) and there is some over-acting by today's standards, but let's remember that they were still trying to hash out what the "talkie" thing was all about. The shots of the walls around the village are stunning as are the views of the NY skyline. As silly as the ape may seem to our eyes, i have to believe that the action sequences must have been stunning to the 1933 audience. In short I watched this film having only seen its exceedingly poor revisit from the 70's and expected a fun, campy film. I was wrong. This film is a heavy hitter that will affect you even today. You cannot consider yourself a fan of monster films without it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get one thing straight right from the beginning. This film was made in 1933.....there was no such thing as computer animation, in fact there weren't even computers.....no blue screen.....no nothing..... the special effects were done with stop motion and models and it was a painstaking process which took great skill. So for those who think that the effects are hokey, go watch "Jurassic Park" and leave this film to the afficionados! Secondly......sure, they didn't treat the King very well.....it was sad when they chained him on the stage and when he was shot down from the Empire State Building, but, people, this is a movie!!!!...not an advertisement for PETA. In 1933, they didn't treat people very well either, so let it go.Watch this film for it's historic value....it was the first popular "big beast" film to capture the public's interest and the special effects were top drawer for the day. Watch it for entertainment....it really is entertaining. Hear Fay Wray scream and wonder what Kong would have done with her if he got to keep her!!!! It deserves it's place in film history and if it's not "politically correct", then you are taking it too seriously. It's glorious!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"King Kong" is not only the grand daddy of all monster movies, it is also one of the greatest movies (of any genre) ever made.  As in most good horror stories, we do not see the monster until well into the picture. Directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack gradually build the suspense by hinting at what may come before actually showing what does. The early scenes are played out amid a foggy scenario and crisp black and white photography. Robert Armstrong plays the fast talking movie producer/director who charters a ship to sail to an undisclosed location under mysterious circumstances to film his next project. Along the way, he convinces an innocent Fay Wray (and her ear-splitting scream)to be his leading lady. A very young Bruce Cabot plays ship's First Mate and her love interest. Of course, the real star of the movie is King Kong himself and the special effects that created him and the other pre-historic monsters that appear in the story. The legendary Willis O'Brien through miniatures, back projection and stop-motion photography, created some of the most amazing creatures and frightening action ever caught on film. The fight between Kong and a T-Rex is unbelievable and the scene where Kong destroys the fallen tree bridge and a New York subway train are also highlights.  But, the scene for which the film is best remembered, has to be Kong's climbing of the Empire State Building and his attempts to fight off the attacking airplanes. The part where Kong looks at Fay Wray for the last time before meeting his fate is unforgettable. The most popular version of this film runs at 100 minutes which shows Kong in a sympathetic light. I have seen the un-cut version that runs at 105 minutes. In that version Kong is more violent and far less sympathetic. A true classic in every sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, simply put, one of the best, greatest fantasy, sci-fi, horror films ever made. Its special effects are inventive, its story-line crisp and creative, its settings superb, and its acting adequate. The title character steals the show in every scene he appears as he carries Fay Wray first through the island jungle amidst prehistoric creatures and natives, and then through the concrete jungle of New York City. Willis O'Brien and his effects started a wave of films that followed in Kong's footsteps. The film is a horror film, and yet it is a tragedy of what happens when man meddles with things beyond him. Robert Armstrong does a fine job as the filmmaker out to capture Kong for American audiences without ever thinking about the consequences of his actions. But in the end, King Kong is a love story of two mis-matched beings.....one spellbound by the others beauty and the girl horrified by the beast's size and appearance.</fullReview>

Only a few years earlier the first talkie was produced, which was a crowning achievement in itself.Anyways, about the film: The actual settings and tone of the movie disappointed me. I felt that more time should have been set with Kong in New York and less time spent keeping track of the happenings on the boat. The relationship between Ann and Jack could have also been touched upon more. I enjoyed this film and relize that it is after all a sci-fi flick and not a romantic drama.7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Monster Movie Still Thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong (1933) **** (out of 4) Classic monster movie has a film crew going to an island where they find much more than what they were expecting. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) winds up on the island and discovers a giant ape that the natives call Kong. Soon the wild beast kidnaps the lovely Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) before she's rescued by her boyfriend (Robert Armstrong). Denham, always thinking of money, decides to capture Kong and take him to New York City to show him off.KING KONG is without question a classic monster movie and certainly one of the most memorable pre-codes from the era. Watching this movie today it's pretty exciting just to think what audiences in 1933 must have thought of the film. The film managed to get through the Hayes Office so we're left with quite a bit of sexuality and some extremely graphic violence for the time. You can't help but think of how horrified people must have been at the sight of Kong biting people to death. I think how raw the film was back then is one reason it has stayed so fresh for future generations.There's a lot of great stuff going on here but there's no question that the highlight has to be Kong himself. The stop-motion work here is extremely well-done and holds up quite nicely today. Yes, the projection is easy to tell today but it's still never bad enough to where it takes you out of the movie. There were so many people who were working behind the scenes to bring Kong to life that it's impossible to mention all of them here but there's no doubt that their work goes down in history. The way they managed to bring Kong to life is quite amazing and what's always impressed me the most was the simple fact that they were able to make him seem like a real creature with emotions. The love story aspect has been played to death in movies that followed but it's quite effective here.Another plus is the cast including the three leads. All of them are extremely good in their roles but it's Wray who steals the show. Another thing going for the film is the wonderful music score and the cinematography also stands out. No matter how many times you see the film you can't get over has fast-paced and exciting the original chase through the jungle is. This entire sequence contains some incredibly wild scenes of the humans going up against Kong while Kong also has to battle various prehistoric animals. All of these scenes are entertainment at the highest level. KING KONG has been remade several times and ripped off even more but the original still stands as the classic.</fullReview>

The stop motion is so fun to watch and since it was made in the 30's it works as an interesting period piece and Is fun to see how creative they had to be with their limited technology. Kong shaking people off a log to their death, fighting dinosaurs, holding onto his love, and of course climbing the empire state building are all super fun and interesting to watch. Ray Harryhausen in incredible and I really need to see more of his movies because this one and clash of the titans both blew me away. I can't wait to dive into more films like this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the original Kong is still king</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often, when I am getting into a web site I am asked my favorite movie, and "King Kong" easily gets the nod. I've probably seen it about 25 times over the years since it jointly opened at New York City's two largest theaters in its time, the Radio City Music Hall, and the Roxy.Later, I saw the edited version with some scenes removed by the tender censors, including the one where Kong stomps a native, in bug-squashing style.The follow-up versions had the advantage of technical superiority but, for its time, the original was amazing and then some. More importantly, it had heart and, it had Fay Wray. I never see it mentioned often - folks are usually obsessed with the fact that she screams a lot - but she was really beautiful woman - a 'beauty' for sure.I won't go into the history of the movie since most other critics got that off their chests, carrying on and on and on, most repeating what others have said.I just want to say that through the years it has never lost its exciting charm, and I will continue to watch and enjoy every year. Here's a weird thought: I would like to have it buried with me. I know --- gross.Anyway, a toast to my favorite primate: KING KONG - the eighth wonder of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think as a Gen Y in this day of age, it is harder for my generation to appreciate films made back long long before we were around. Now all we like is big guns, visual effects with dopey story lines.So it is nice to know that I can still appreciate what filmmakers achieved back in the 30's. I mean sure, some of the effects may seem a little goofy but it is a terrific achievement for what they achieved back then. A lot of Kong's close ups look really realistic and are also frightening with his eerie glances and stares.The story is still the same as the original. Anne is asked by Carl Denham to accompany him to a mysterious island to make a film. Anne, thinking this is her big chance to make it big as an actress, joins along only to have the crew encounter a lost tribe, and a giant gorilla - Kong.While I think the remake did a lot more in terms of character development as well as the relationship with Anne and Kong, this film is all about the disaster aspects and the epic journey rather than the love relationships Peter Jackon's focused on. And why shouldn't it be? It works as a disaster film, a monster film and just a great time to spend an hour and a half. There are some really fun scenes, such as when Kong fights the T Rex. I was amazed at the sea monster that attacked the crew because at times it looked really real.I have to admire what films in the old times could do so while I have some minor issues, it is mainly because I am not entirely used to the period back then depicted in 30's films. But it certainly is growing on me and this doesn't really impact on my liking of the film at all. Yeah sure it's not as developed as the remake, nor do you get to particularly warm up to the characters or get to know them as well, but hey - this version is all about Kong! And Kong surely makes his presence made in a major way because he is the main star and the filmmakers sure made sure of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Once and Future King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply the best 'Lost World' type movie ever made. Numerous lost world films have been made since King Kong was released in 1933. Few have come close to the bar set by Kong. None have surpassed it. Neither of the two remakes of Kong have measured up, as both movies are seriously flawed. What sets this movie apart is that it combines a lost world adventure with a Beauty and the Beast theme. Both aspects are brilliantly realized. The interesting question in this movie is what do our hearty explorers do when they come in contact with a primeval world? They try to take something sensational back to civilization, of course! But at the same time, in a brilliant twist of storytelling, something primeval (Kong) tries to take something civilized (Ann) back into the primeval world. Beauty and the Beast is a powerful fairy tale, surfacing in France a few centuries ago. But the roots of the story are deep indeed, stretching all the way back to the dawn of civilization. As part of the Sumerian Gilgamesh cycle, the priestess/harlot Shamhat seduces the wild man, Enkidu, and thereby tames him and integrates him into civilization. A Beauty and the Beast story reaches deep down to tap into this expression of primordial female sexual power. Fay Wray is perfectly cast as Ann Darrow. She combines playful innocence with smokin' hot sexiness. Her screams made her famous, and they perfectly express her raw terror of the dark primeval world. Kong is an amazing creation, especially considering the state of the art of special effects back in the day. His facial expressions and body movements portray what he is thinking and feeling. His lust for Ann Darrow is unambiguous and terrifying.The other characters are good too. Robert Armstrong is great fun as Carl Denham, the obsessed and eccentric filmmaker. The tough guy sailor, Driscoll, played by Bruce Cabot, is a little bit dull but believable. The sets are great. The dark island, the dark jungle are truly foreboding. The stop motion dinosaurs not only look good, but interact meaningfully within the context of the adventure. No ultra hyper, too quick, impossible video game CG effects here. The creatures move with a sense of power and menace. The scenes in New York are wonderful, dark, violent and frightening. Of course, the airplanes shooting at Kong while he is at the top of the Empire State Building is one of the all-time great moments in movie history. When Kong dies, it is a sad and tragic end, but a fitting one. The dialog at the end is brilliant, insightful, and powerful. Leutenant: "Well Denham, it looks like the airplanes got him." Denham: "Oh No, it wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast." Great stuff. Great movie. I need to watch it again, for the umpteenth time, right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The undisputed king of monster movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be 75 years old, but the original King Kong still towers head and hairy shoulders above all other creature features thanks to its wonderful story, great direction, impressive special effects (with only the occasionally dodgy shot due to the technical limitations of the day), and some terrific performances (most noticeably from a very beguiling Fay Wray as the damsel in distress).Unlike the recent bloated Peter Jackson remake, Merrian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack's 1933 masterpiece is a lean, mean monster of a movie: each scene drives the story forward (no time for stampeding dinosaurs or ice skating in Central Park in this one!) and the whole package is perfectly paced, the result being one of the finest fantasy films in cinema history.In case you're not familiar with the story (yeah, right!), the film follows a risk-taking movie director, Carl Denham, and his team, as they travel to Skull Island where they hope to find and film the legendary Kong, a huge ape worshipped by the local tribe. Once at the island, however, their plans change when the human star of the film, Ann Darrow, is kidnapped by the locals and offered as a sacrifice to the huge gorilla.After mounting an exciting and semi-successful rescue mission (they get Ann, but lose a lot of men in the process), Denham and pals decide to capture Kong and take him home to New York where they hope to make a mint showing him off as The Eighth Wonder of the World: a great plan, except for the fact that Kong has fallen head over heels for the beautiful Ms. Darrow and he won't let a few chains stop him from being with his gal.The film consists of three acts: the build up to the action, where we meet the players and the basic plot is revealed; the island adventure, in which Kong makes off with Ann, closely followed by her fellow travellers; and the New York action, in which Kong once again grabs Ann and tries to avoid capture by climbing The Empire State Building. The first act is mostly talk, but whizzes by thanks to likable characters and an unfussy script, and the last two parts are pretty much non-stop action, with the jungle scenes including mucho dinosaur mayhem (with Kong fighting a T-Rex and a giant snake/lizard thingy), and the city rampage featuring lots of the big guy trashing trains and generally being pretty destructive (before the tragic ending sees him shot down by several bi-planes).Since this film was made, there have been many pretenders to the giant ape throne (Son of Kong, Mighty Joe Young, King Kong Lives, two remakes, and Queen Kong, to mention a few), but none have managed to come close to the brilliance of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong 1933. I wanted to see this film when the 2005 King Kong came out.I was familiar with King Kong,I mean, I heard of the film, but I wasn't really bothered about it. When I was young, the creature feature movie that I was drawn to was Jurassic Park. I first watched King Kong 1933 on UKTV Gold, and I liked it. Not much teenagers like black and white films or old films,but I do. I like this film, it's brilliant.Everyone in the world has probably heard of King Kong. When the big gorilla first hit movie screens was around the time of The Great Depression.People had little money for food and water, but they still saw this film, and they were amazed!People were able to escape into a new world full of adventure and thrills and even chills. The storyline is fun. It's about a group of film-makers who travel to "Skull Island," they meet weird natives and discover a 50FT gorilla that falls in love with the only female there. They also discover pre-historic creatures on the island:Tyrannosaurus Rex,Pterosaur(s), Brontosaurus, Stegosaurus and more. There are memorable scenes in the film, like when King Kong and the T-Rex fight, and of course,when they bring Kong to New York and he causes lots of destruction, he finds his girl then gets shot and falls of The Empire State Building, the tallest building in New York at the time, he then dies. This film is part of our culture, there has been other movies involving Kong. There were (and probably still) King Kong toys.

		<shortDescription>One of the amazing monster films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many young people, I became aware of King Kong through multiple references and I'd always see clips of the movie but never whole thing. Make no mistake about it, I hadn't seen it yet I'm familiar with name King Kong. Oh yes, he sure garners all success that he could only strives for, which all of us mortals dream of. I didn't see whole movie because it was not very access to me, i.e. video stores doesn't carry it nor is it shown on television in where I live. It is inevitable that I should see it because I'm lover of classic cinema and I don't think I should apologize that I haven't seen it yet because DVD version was long shot but now it's available to suave bastards like myself.Like many moviegoers, I was very surprised to learn the news that Peter Jackson announced that he would remake King Kong, which was one of his personal favorites. My answer to that is indifference because Jackson makes hell lot of money and he can do whatever he pleased to, even if it means that he's going to remake his favorite movie. I find it very strange that one would remake one's favorite movie because that has to mean a lot to that person. But remake it? For what? Why do you have to improve on the film if it's absolutely your favorite? Out of curiosity, I decided to order the DVD version of King Kong off the Internet since the price wasn't too bad. Apparently for some reasons, I receive it along with Aeon Flux DVD set on same day but I'm not going to complain since it will fill up my weekend time. I'm man of leisure if you guys didn't know that already.King Kong, that I absolutely agree, is one of the best damned adventure movies ever! I never had experience something like King Kong because it's so different yet it's so awesome at the same time. I think it's just amazing that how well King Kong had age after all those years. It shows you how advance the special effects in King Kong were. I really enjoy every moment of it and I have no regret spend a pretty penny on excellent DVD.The special effects in King Kong may be bit crude to modern eyes but it works because it's so out of this world and very cinematic at the same time. The special effects in Titanic and Jurassic Park may be realistic but it's not same fun as you had watch King Kong because it's so unique. It's astonishing, really.What I like the most about King Kong is that filmmakers took their time to establishing the characters, which is seldom seen in modern cinema. They devoted first 40 minutes developing the characters and building the suspense. By the time 40 minutes mark pass, it's out of control and relentless! The pacing and directing are just right on the mark and we are never bored because King Kong is always whipping other monsters' candy asses to prove that he is indeed the King of the jungle.It is so surrealism to watch this film because it's very unique experience and yet it's so modern. Its terrific film in its own rights and it is easy why many people hold this film in highly regarded because it's so great. Easily one of the best of 1930s, in my opinion. It's outstanding motion picture that shouldn't be missed.I'm having my doubts about Peter Jackson's remake because I heard it will be flesh out to 3 hours, instead of original, which run 1 hour and 45 minutes. I think I'd prefer original because the story is very tight and it has sharp directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The king of monster movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to monster movies, you just can't beat the original King Kong. RKO pictures released a plethora of great horror movies in the thirties and forties, and this one is among the best of them. King Kong is a variation on the classic Beauty and the Beast plot line, and sees themes of love, the desire of man to discover the undiscovered and the ills of being somewhere you don't belong, wound tightly around an invigorating and exciting B-movie plot line. Really, you don't expect this sort of film to have anything in the way of a theme going on underneath the surface; but that's the great thing about RKO's films; they tend to be more than what the appear to be. King Kong will appeal to fans of entertaining monster action, as well as providing ample food for thought for people that want more than just giant apes and dinosaurs from their films. The plot follows a film crew that heads off to an uncharted island in order to shoot a movie. The director, a man named Carl Denham has another reason for wanting to go there, however; reported sightings of a so-called god - King Kong.King Kong is one of the most important films ever made. It has paved the way for almost every other B-movie made after it's release, and also showed an impressive array of special effects, especially considering that it was made way back in 1933. These days, everything is made with computers; so it's refreshing to see a movie made with real effects, even if it is over seven decades old. The special effects here do look aged, but then again - they are aged. However, this doesn't make the film impossible to watch by today's standards. Some of the earliest films to use CGI are unwatchable now, but there's something attractive about the stop motion effects on display in this movie. Despite the fact that it's obvious how King Kong has been brought to life; it's easy to believe that the great ape, along with the rest of the creatures, is actually alive. The locations that the characters and monsters in the film inhabit adhere to this also, with Skull Island looking like it's bustling with life, and New York City providing the stark urban contrast. The way that the film shows these two places; the state of the art city, and the purely primitive island, is one of the most striking things about the entire motion picture.The characters are brought to life by a talented cast of B-movie actors, most notably; Fay Wray, who takes the role of the young actress that Kong takes a liking to. This is the film that she is best known for, and will therefore be the one that the actress will always be remembered for starring in. There's a good reason for this, as she provides the film with the perfect heroine; and her screams really are the central element of King Kong. The 'love' story between Wray and Kong is the central theme, but it's never truly explored. The scenes with both Kong and Wray in them seem to be a little bit rushed, and they never get to share any screen time without other things, such as Tyrannosaurs and Aeroplanes, interfering. However, the way that the giant ape protects his woman is no doubt touching, and the fact that these elements have been introduced into the film gives it an extra amount of emotional impact upon the film's heartbreaking conclusion. On the whole; everything about this film is classic. From the action scenes, all the way down to the final quote; you can't call yourself a fan of B-movies until you've seen the original masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original and the best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong (1933) is a classic tale of beauty and the beast. A ancient animal lives on a mysterious land (Skull Island) that is hidden from the rest of the world. A rich man and his crew travel to the island and try and locate the "Eighth Wonder of the World". This giant behemoth is dubbed King Kong, the man eating monster whom the natives fear. The explorers have one hell of a time trying to find the beast. They have to cross a land that time really forgot. Dinosaurs and other strange creatures inhabit the terra and pick off the humans one by one. Normally the beast would have nothing to do with the nosy visitors but he's smitten by the lady in the group and saves the humans. His reward for being helpful is being chained up and dragged off to "civilization". Will King Kong adjust to life in the city? Can he find love with a woman who's a fraction of his size? How will the people of New Yorl react to the "eighth wonder of the world"? Find out in this movie classic!One of the best films ever made. If it was on my long list. The directors made one incredible film that made them a ton of money and spawned two sequels. The stop motion film making was phenomenal and the direction and cinematography was top notched. Fay Wray became a household name and one of the first "scream queens" and King Kong became a part of Americana. This film was remade several times and Japan made a couple of unauthorized sequels.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stop-mo animation and the screaming Fay Wray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 30s Hollywood twist on the Beauty and the Beast story starts when a pretty young girl (the late Fay Wray) is picked to star in the next film producer of Carl Denham, known for his exotic locations and animal photography. On this trip Denham and his crew find more than they bargained for, in the large and majestic gorilla King Kong, worshipped as a God by the islanders, and depicted in excellent primitive FX. Kong falls in love with the wispy Wray and kills lizards and all kinds of scaly threatening beasties for her.Wray has a soppy human suitor too, in the colourless Bruce Cabot, but it is the monster who truly shows his feelings for her when he takes her away from what he sees as danger (after the director and crew have captured him and made a stage spectacle of him), and in the final scene atop the Empire State when you see the huge paw reach for his little lady (as she screams and almost faints from sheer terror) it is curiously touching.King Kong is as much about persecution and intolerance as it is a horror film. It says a lot about monetary greed and impossible dreams. The upcoming remake will hopefully do this film justice (the 1970s version tried and failed, and this early version stands up better even after all these years).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The images in this film stay with you your whole life... I saw it on TV as a child and have watched it again and again over the years. As an adventure film it set the standard. King Kong is so much more than The Beast... his creator imbued him with heart and soul that makes the climax touching, not just exciting. And once you've seen it you can't see the Empire State Building without looking for that big ape climbing up the side. I just read that Fay Wray has died. Time has done what the Beast would not. I have heard that Peter Jackson wants to remake this film. I am filled with dread. He will puff it up with overdone special effects and gut the soul. If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing this movie...go now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite its age, King Kong remains one of the greatest, most influential adventure/monster films ever made.The direction is atmospheric but quite typical for this time period and for a film of this sort.Edgar Wallace and Merian C. Cooper's use of a `Beauty and the Beast'-type storyline is quite interesting and a unique take on the classic tale.The acting is very melodramatic but in a way that makes the film fun. Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot are so hammy that they are, at times, comical to watch. Frank Reicher is quite convincing as Captain Englehorn. Fay Wray is good at playing the damsel in distress. Max Steiner's grand musical score suits the magnitude of the film nicely.Ted Cheesman's editing is great. Though the film has a running time of only 100 minutes, it does stay interesting throughout.The legendary special effects are clearly dated by today's standards but it's easy to see how believable they would have been in 1933.King Kong is not the groundbreaking film it was when it was released but it still manages to be a wonderfully enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absolute definition of how to develop the "bad guy" in a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the icon upon which all the great dramatic writers and directors base the development of the "bad guy" in their movies. The trick to developing a proper "bad guy" in the movies. MAKE US LOVE HIM/HER.When I was a very young boy I first saw this movie, much to my chagrin at the time, with my sister. All my friends were going to see it with their buddies, brothers, and making a big blockbuster thing about it. Well, we were poor, and we had to wait for it to come on the television. There was no one else to watch it with except my big sister, who I loved dearly, but she wasn't my first choice. I learned the biggest movie lesson of my life from my big sister that day. You see, when the movie got to all the parts that my friends said were cool I would look at my big sister and see her crying.Crying? She was supposed to be having fun watching them shoot up the monster, instead she was crying out through her tears, large sobbing tears, "It's not his fault. Why don't they let him go. He wasn't bothering anybody. Now he has to diiiiiiie. It's not his fault" And, years later, when I got involved in movies, I realized what a masterpiece this movie was. I mean a MASTERPIECE. Anytime you see a GOOD movie with a bad guy you'll see that the writer and director took the time to develop the "bad guy" and make us love him. The PRETTY GOOD ones will succeed in making us emphathize with the "bad guy". The great ones will make us love the "bad guy" even in the face of terrible horror. If you are a serious student of film you MUST see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ring That Native Gong For The Mighty King Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a technical aspect Peter Jackson's 2005 version of King Kong is so obviously superior of this original version they hardly merit being mentioned in the same breath. But this version in that not yet tacky RKO jungle set still gives one a feeling of horror down to the marrow of your bones as modern man of 1933 faces the primeval forces of nature that have survived out in the Pacific.Certainly there are some absurdities here. The RKO jungle set which was originally used for The Most Dangerous Game and then for King Kong was not a clich yet to be seen a hundred or so films during the life of that studio. Still fans of the classic films can't possibly miss those same sets and stock footage. No wonder the Tarzan series eventually came to this studio.Of course the South Sea island natives don't bear any resemblance to folks of African descent. But a lot of black people were grateful for the paycheck as extras to be natives here during the Depression. But for 1933 the special effects were a marvel, the creation of those ancient Jurassic beasts and the 50 foot gorilla that was King Kong still make you gasp. Most of all the sincere playing of the three leads all of whom got their career roles from this film. Stalwart Bruce Cabot, helpless heroine Fay Wray, and brash producer Robert Armstrong do make you believe in their performances. Even Fay Wray who mostly just screamed and looked helpless got more out of that than most actresses do with a few pages of dialog.I marvel also at the expressions that Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack's camera recorded on the miniature that served as King Kong. Movies were only six years away from when they learned to talk, so I think it helped that so many who must have worked on King Kong had experience in silent film. Look at the range of emotions they capture from the beast, watching him is like watching a performance from some of the best of the silent screen stars when facial expressions and much gesticulation had to compensate for lack of dialog. Especially that death scene in the end, like seeing Pagliacci.I must have first seen King Kong as a lad on WOR channel 9 when that stationed filled its broadcast time with a library of RKO classics. It was probably before I was in kindergarten, it fascinated me then.And it still fascinates me now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(r#42)Insane! This isn't the way it's supposed to be! I'm a 15 year old kid. I shouldn't catch my thrills from a monster movie from the thirties! I should be getting my kicks from Pirates of the Caribbean or The Fast and the Furious! But no. Somehow, this dated, silly old movie was a shock of emotion. It has more action than every other thirties' movie put together. The monsters had more personality than Gamera, Godzilla and Jason Voorhees put together. The special effects were incredible considering when it was made. Fay Wray makes for a gorgeous leading lady.So is the acting "good", by the usual standards? Has acting in monster/disaster movies EVER been good? Let me put it this way: Bruce Cabot, Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray are better in this movie than Matthew Broderick in Godzilla or Dennis Quaid in The Day After Tomorrow. They blow Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum in Independence Day out of the water. They easily put George Clooney's so called "performance" in The Perfect Storm to shame. They're just plain likable and charming. Their character development is perfectly presented. We get to know as much as we need about these characters without taking away too much screen time from the true star, Kong.And Kong is by far the most badass movie monster of all time. He is badass because he snaps open the jaws of T-rexes just to save his crush. He is badass because he's real. He shows emotion. He acts like apes act. I can't praise the stop motion animators enough. They are the true heroes of this movie. Every monster, down to the tiniest snake, are given personality. Take a look at the T-rex that attacks Anne. The monster's very first move is to naturally, realistically, scratch itself. This sort of attention to detail is what makes the effects in Kong better than anything seen since. Peter Jackson is the only director who has paid as much attention to detail in his Lord of the Rings trilogy.The film moves at an enormously fast pace considering the time period. It never feels boring. Scenes are exactly as long as they should be. It's just amazing. Kong's death scene had me in tears. I just love this movie. It's no wonder this is Peter Jackson's favourite.Watch it for its historical or emotional value - it's just plain amazing even 73 years later. Awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A labor of love deservedly hailed as classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KING KONG (1933) has often been hailed as one of the greatest horror-fantasy films, but the critical vision of our suffering humanity it offered up is what made it terrifying beyond the usual werewolf and vampire scenario.You know the story. A rock'em sock'em show business empresario takes off for a place unknown in order to bring back a beast of legend. Why? Because he wants to. Because he and his crew are going to be millionaires. In order to accomplish this, he enlists a bunch of merchant seamen, disrupts the life and fragile fauna of a "more backward civilization" with the assistance of these modern conquistadores, and captures the wildest thing known of in creation. He takes the Wild Thing back to New York City, where it goes berserk, grabs its obscure object of desire, and destroys everything in sight until it is brought down by the forces of "civilization". "T'was beauty killed the beast", says our protagonist. Right.KING KONG was popular in the United States in the 1930s for the same reason other science fantasy and horror films were. Most people in the country, their lives wrecked by depression and social indifference, reached for a fantasy life in which outlaw culture was celebrated and the little man won. A life where one's own dreams and ideas weren't constantly circumvented by the impersonal designs of technology, commerce, and distant, powerful people. KING KONG was the free thing in everyone, the thing brought down by medicine show hucksters and the "efficiency" experts most people encountered in a world not made for a democratic culture. KING KONG is the wilded, winded beast set loose, brought low by superior firepower, but bound to rise again and again in more refined rebellion. At some level, everyone knows this. But it doesn't matter if some people really don't. Keep the theory or shuck it away, it follows us wherever we go.At a very concrete level, what matters is that Willis O'Brien left to us all this lovely, primitive, sensitive labor of painstaking animated love that is deservedly called a classic. Merian Cooper contributed the spark, but there would have been no fire without O'Brien.Cast-wise, the only really interesting human performers are the inimitable scream queen Fay Wray, Frank Reicher (who plays the ship's captain), and the under-appreciated Black American actor Noble Johnson. Johnson appears here as a chieftain in the usual Hollywood stereotype of Black Third World culture. Johnson would later take his earnings as a Hollywood extra back to New York City, where he and actor Charles Gilpin (among others) invested in independent Black cinema.In a contemporary light, the whole work seems corny. But give yourself to KING KONG, suspend the critical eye, watch and see if this isn't one of the most beautiful and moving works of cinematic fantasy in the history of U.S. film making.</fullReview>

The expedition to god--knows-where, the island full of forgotten savages, and all hints pointing to something big. And it delivers. But what's amazing about this movie is how the effects hold up even today and really sell the idea that this giant ape is really on the loose and instilling terror in the heart of arrogant man, be it on a faraway island or in the heart of New York City. The stop-motion here is first-rate, and Kong is surprisingly expressive given the circumstances. That fight with the T-Rex is still awesome.So yeah, as monsters movies go, this thing is an undisputed classic.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of its classic status</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unscrupulous showman Carl Denham (robustly played by Robert Armstrong) heads an expedition to Skull Island, which he plans on using as the location for his latest movie. Denham and company discover a legendary giant ape known by the natives on the island as King Kong. Kong becomes infatuated with aspiring actress Ann Darrow (an appealing portrayal by the fetching Fay Wray). Denham manages to capture Kong and take him back to New York City only to have Kong escape and run amok.Directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack bring an awesome and impressive sense of scope and spectacle: The scenes on Skull Island with Kong fighting various enormous prehistoric creatures and the tough and dashing Jack Driscoll (a sturdy and engaging performance by Bruce Cabot) leading a rescue party into the treacherous jungle in order to retrieve Ann remain extremely lively and exciting to this very day. Kong's rampage in the Big Apple likewise seriously smokes, with a doozy of a thrilling and tragic climax set on top of the Empire State Building. The smart script by Ruth Rose and James Ashmore not only offers an inspired take on the classic timeless premise of beauty and the beast, but also provides a trenchant commentary on the more exploitative aspects of showbiz and thwarted male desire (Kong can easily be seen as a monstrous embodiment of Denham's repressed lustful feelings towards Ann). Willis H. O'Brien's tremendous stop-motion animation work installs Kong with a remarkable amount of savage, yet noble personality and does an astonishing job of bringing the huge simian to convincing life. Max Steiner's rousing score and the elegant black and white cinematography are also on the money excellent and effective. Best of all, there's no attempt to remotely sanitize Kong in any way; he's without a doubt a ferocious and frightening brute who's capable of shocking acts of extreme violence and brutality. Essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic that stands the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several things that could be ridiculed about this movie ? the stop-motion special effects of course, though they were state of the art for their day, the stereotypical natives (and Chinese cook), and besides all that, Fay Wray's goofy reaction when she's told by a sailor he loves her (my goodness on the acting, take a look at it someday).There are also definite racial overtones to the movie. It's as if Kong is just a giant version of one of the 'black savages' on the island. He has a forbidden love for a white woman. Captured, he is taken back to America, where he'll make the white men rich, so long as he is in chains. Set loose, he rampages through New York violently. Clearly, he would have been better off left back in the jungle where he belongs.However, forgiving the movie a bit, it's still quite compelling because of its action sequences. Cooper and Schoedsack tell a taut story with the right blend of build-up and action, and make the island far more interesting by having it full of dangers besides Kong himself. The pursuers are attacked by a stegosaurus (which they somewhat comically shoot the hell out of), and later a sauropod in the sea, which overturns their raft and chomps a couple of them (apparently the filmmakers were unaware of these dinosaurs being herbivores). Kong himself has to battle a Tyrannosaurus Rex, a giant snake (which fantastically wraps around his neck), and a pterodactyl trying to make off with Fay Wray. Who can forget him killing the T-Rex by bending its jaw and neck back until their broken? Or turning the log bridge around to shake men off, sending them plummeting to their death? Or reaching his paw down into the cave, trying to catch a guy who has made his way down there? (the guy, by the way, has to cut a rope to save himself from a lizard creeping up from below at the same time).There is plenty of violence that must have been shocking in its day. Kong literally stomps on natives and crushes a few people in his mouth. He also drops a woman out of a skyscraper after determining she's not Fay Wray and discards her. As for some sex to go with that violence, Fay Wray provides it with a braless scene on the boat, her legs wriggling after Kong has partially undressed her, and a split-second wardrobe malfunction after she plummets into the water while escaping him. I'm not sure I buy the Empire State Building being a giant phallic symbol though.This is a movie that stands the test of time, despite how dated the effects are. They have campy appeal, and are still somehow cool. We feel Kong's pain as he's chained, and empathize with him as the airplanes swoop in at the end. This is a beauty and the beast type film, but I don't think it was beauty that truly killed the beast, as the movie's last line states, I think it was all those guys with their guns and greed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is a horror adventure and breathtaking. The topic is very interesting. The story is not complex, but it is fast and exciting. I think the effects are extremely impressive. Stop motion animation has been experimental, but also revolutionary at the same time. Willis O'Brien has invested a lot of effort and did a great job. The fact that the film did not have a big budget and censorship is cut movie several times. I will always take the side of brave and somewhat crazy directors who have grappled with this issue.The film is rich in contrasts and certainly not a technological marvel. Not much attention was given to acting. None of the character does not have the necessary depth. Fay Wray was launched to the forefront because of the fore and some nudity. The screams are cheap and extremely irritating. Set design is excellent. Dramaturgy bad. King Kong is the best actor. Beast that knows what she wants. Driscoll and Anne are just a hero and beauty in distress. A wildly dramatic musical score by Max Steiner enhanced the action of the story.King Kong is a quick movie, which is a little naive, but not at all boring. Special effects are revolutionary. Adventure horror that in the heart of the story has a huge gorilla is one of my favorite films of the thirties. I always watch him with a lot of melancholy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally liked King Kong. From the well rounded characters to the classic look and filming of this movie. The first of its kind special effects that were used were interesting and also the fact that this movie directly impacted and effected many films that were made after it allowed me to appreciate the film even more. I enjoyed the techniques and effects that were used throughout the movie. I also enjoyed the suspense that the movie had throughout. From when wondering what is behind the giant wall in the village to when Kong has Ann in his hands at the top of the Empire State Building. One scene that really caught my attention was when you could see only Kong's eyes through the destroyed train. Even though it's hard to compare the new version to the old one just on the basis of the vast amount of breath taking scenes from the new version. And the introduction of animation and details that were impossible to produce when the original was made. Even through all this this film still is in equal contention with the newer versions made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is such a classic, and I have always heard so much about it. I feel like King Kong is referenced to in so many modern movies as well as television shows. I had always heard of this film, but never quite knew the full story. I actually really liked it, I felt like it was really easy to follow along with and get into. I also like how the basis of the film started out, Mr. Denham wants to make a movie, and I like the idea of a movie being about a movie, especially so early on in the movie making industry. It is interesting and gives slight insight to audiences as to what goes into making a movie, and how difficult it can be sometimes for directors to find actors who are willing to work with their visions. I also really liked how very early on Mr. Denham made a reference to Anne with the small monkey on the ship, referring to them as "the beauty and the beast"...it hooks the audience and makes us wait for what that scene was so clearly foreshadowing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is an amazing movie. It really is a masterpiece. What those guys where able to do back in 1933 is pretty remarkable to make such a film. King Kong shall always be remembered as an inspirational movie. I'm not sure how accurate this statement is, but I think King Kong has inspired just about every single director there is. Peter Jack was one who was inspired by Willis O'Brien's work. So was Ray Harryhousen, the world's most famous special effects god, even he was amazed and inspired by O'Brien's work.The King Kong story itself is a wonderful, beauty-and-the-beast type situation, similar to The Huntchback of Notre Dame. King Kong is always first imagines as a frightening, enormous, beast, but he really is just a misunderstood being that has never experienced love until Anne Darrow comes to his island.I'm amazed at hoe most film professors with shove "Citizen Kane is the best movie in the world" down our throats. Why can't King Kong be the best movie in the world?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this, I was less than impressed with how everything looked. Now that is due to the quality of movies today, and after putting my mind almost 80 years in the past, I came to the conclusion that this movie was well done. People in the early 30's never had a film like this. From giant apes, to dinosaurs, to a lost island with locals performing sacrifice rituals. The story itself it sound, and it is pretty well done. I personally enjoyed how Kong put his life on the line in order to ensure the welfare of Ann. You can absolutely feel the emotions Kong expresses for Ann. He saves her from a plethora of beasts, and when he is captured and brought back to New York City, he thinks he is saving her from the flashing lights. You can feel the love Kong has for Ann, and you can feel sadness when Kong is shot which results to the free fall to his death. For a science fiction monster movie, this must have been thrilling for the people of the 30's, and even terrifying at some points. Again, the emotions portrayed allow you to feel them as they come and go. From the thrilling action and fighting, to the sadness with Kong's death, it is well done for its time. Though the screaming Ann does definitely was over the top and by far used too much, got the point around that she was horrified. The acting is normal or maybe a bit below par for the time, it does not hurt the movie for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the most recent version of this movie before I saw this one, I wasn't sure what to expect with the effects that I had anticipated. However, for it's time the effects of King Kong were very impressive. The iconic Empire State Building Scene was everything it was played up to be. Although you can clearly tell the gorilla is fake, it makes you feel the same love you feel in the newer version when the gorilla doesn't look as fake. Fay Wray plays the part without a hitch. She executes the damsel in distress role perfectly. You can definitely feel the emotions that she feels with King Kong. Overall it was very well made and the creators used their resources very wisely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The strange adventures on Skull Mountain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece of special effects, 1933's King Kong remains to this day the first great science fiction gem. While it has been remade several times and also is in the process of becoming a Broadway musical, the 1933 classic will never lose its place as one of the greatest films of all time.the film features an excellent performance by Robert Armstrong as a filmmaker who goes around the world looking for locations to create adventure epics. He is on the road to his greatest adventure ever, but it won't come without a price.Finding a leading lady at a local mission, he takes her along to school island where they are in search of the elusive Kong, a legend widely known by men of the sea, but one that very few people have actually encountered. Armstrong's assistant Bruce Cabot falls in love with the leading lady played by Fay Wray in her greatest screen role. the adventure on the island find the group not only in countering the unfriendly natives who reside on the island, but some prehistoric creatures as well, including several variations of dinosaurs. A scene of a brontosaurus making a snack out of one of the crew members hiding in a tree remains very horrific, and when Wray is abducted by a pterodactyl, that is equally as horrifying. Kong's entrance is very dramatic, and once again, Wray is being the victim. Having been abducted by the native, she is tied in between two trees and left to be a sacrifice for the approaching giant gorilla. The scenes on the island are a perfect example of stop motion animation at its best. While Wray does little more than just green, she entered film in mortality with this role, and Armstrong would go on to star in the comical sequel, "Son of Kong", and the 1949 variation of the same story, "Mighty Joe Young". the tension of the film explodes when Armstrong, Cabot, and Wray return to New York with a sedated Kong, and prepare to present him in a huge spectacle. Of course, Kong is seriously angry when he regained consciousness, and manages to escape, tearing the Big Apple upside down. Scenes of people being pulled out of their apartments by the huge beast are quite frightening. you can see a lot of influence in science fiction films of the fifties where various parts of the world where all of a sudden invaded by various giant creatures. Outstanding photography, an excellent music score, and quick pacing make this an absolute must for film viewers of any age or era.while the remakes have their qualities, they do not compare in the least with the original version. while it may have been beauty who killed the beast, it was the ingenious work of the people behind the scenes who have made this movie one of the most unforgettable in screen history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me way too long to finally watch the original having seen both the other versions. And even though the 1976 version is generally the lowest rated version which I haven't seen in ages, I can still remember some scenes pretty well. This in comparison to the 2005 version which I didn't see that long ago and hardly remember much of it. Even though I didn't think there was much chemistry (for lack of a better word) between beauty Faye Wray and monster ape Kong, I think this movie is really good in all other aspects. Granted it takes a while before the movie gets going. But once the film crew gets on the island things really get interesting. We get treated to some old fashion monster and stop motion monsters. Next to Kong there is plenty of other creatures which are often a bigger threat to the human visitors of the island. OK that the fights Kong has with the other creatures take sometimes a bit too long than necessary is only a minor complaint. I was surprised how explicit the horror was a times with Kong trampling or putting people between his teeth. Stood the test of time really well I must say.</fullReview>

Agent Charles Weston is unwilling to send a girl to an unknown place for an unknown length of time. Denham finds desperate Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) on the streets trying to steal an apple and offers her the lead in the movie. The ship's first mate Jack Driscoll falls for the beauty. Denham tells Driscoll and Capt. Englehorn about an uncharted island in the East Indies and the story of Kong. He wants to make a movie of beauty and the beast.It's a bit of a slow start. Fay Wray is a compelling actress. Her blonde hair and the piercing screams are outstanding. The native village is a big set but a little bit campy. At least the natives are done well for its time. The movie really takes off with the introduction of King Kong after 45 minutes. The stop-motion animation still works today. The addition of rear projection is terrific especially for its time. The fight between King Kong and T-Rex is a classic. For its many iconic movie moments, this deceives to be enjoyed.</fullReview>

This has got to be one of the top "must see before you die" movies due to it's extraordinary stop-motion animation - well before CGI computer animation filled the moving pictures. The story of King Kong is not one of the greatest stories ever told in my opinion but it is an entertaining story without a doubt.What makes King Kong so horrifying to me is his mammoth size. If he was real, he could easily destroy building and vehicles while causing harm to humans and other animals just as you see in King Kong films.All in all - King Kong is great entertainment.

		<shortDescription>Monumental, influential and still entertaining after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1933 King Kong was a sensation and it is easy to see why. To the jaded modern eye the film may appear quite ordinary. But it was a marvel of its time, a massive achievement, a film which changed films forever. And dated though it may be it still has the capacity to entertain all these years later. Yes, the dialogue may be hokey. The acting may be hammy. And the visual effects, so revolutionary for their time, seem laughably primitive in this age of computerized effects wizardry. But the film still works. It has old-school charm, a simple story which grabs you and a truly legendary monster. Better effects don't necessarily make for a better movie as Michael Bay proves on a regular basis. You need a story, you need that hook, you need something actually worth caring about. This movie has those things. And that is why King Kong still fascinates us today.The very simple, but engaging, story follows Carl Denham, a filmmaker who leads a party sailing from New York to film...something. Somewhere. He won't tell anyone where they're going or why. This secrecy understandably makes it difficult to secure a leading lady for his film. Denham plucks young, beautiful Ann Darrow off the street. Starving, unemployed, with nothing to lose Ann agrees to go off on this mysterious voyage. Her presence aboard the ship annoys first mate Jack Driscoll who believes a ship is no place for a dame. But Jack inevitably falls in love with her, maybe because she's beautiful, probably because the plot requires him to. There needs to be a hero to rush in and save Ann when she's a damsel in distress. And boy will there ever be distress.So after much stilted dialogue and, from Robert Armstrong playing Denham in particular, some seriously hammy acting the voyage reaches its destination. It's a mysterious island somewhere around Indonesia inhabited by a small tribe of primitive natives. But Denham's not here for them. He's here for the island's other inhabitant. Kong. The giant, prehistoric ape is no mythical creature. He's all too real as Ann will find out when she manages to get herself captured by the natives and offered up as a gift to the great beast. But a funny thing happens. The beast loves the beauty. And will do anything to protect her. And protect her he must because Kong is not the only giant, prehistoric creature on this island. Kong battles one giant monster after another. All the while Driscoll is racing through the jungle trying to reach and rescue the woman he loves. After some more monster battles and a Kong rampage through the poor native village we find ourselves back in New York. Yes, rather sudden and jarring it is. Snap your fingers and Kong is on Broadway, setting up one of the most famous endings in film history.There are certainly things you can quibble with in King Kong. The dialogue, even allowing for the time the film was made, is impossibly corny. Armstrong's hamming it up grows tiresome very quickly. And there is the sense that once we meet Kong the story somewhat gets lost. From there it's all about visual effects, the monsters take over the movie. When Kong battles the T-Rex it's thrilling. But then he has to battle another monster. And another one. And it gets rather repetitive. The effects team did such a great job bringing Kong to life I suppose you can't blame the filmmakers for wanting to show off a bit. But as Kong rampages throughout the last half of the film you can't help but think maybe the humans in this story could've had a little more to do. Fay Wray more than earns her scream queen designation here as she plays Ann. But she probably was capable of doing more than looking pretty and screaming her lungs out. Maybe the love affair between Ann and Driscoll could have been explored further, maybe during the long journey back to New York which we never got to see. But of course Kong was always going to be the star of this movie. They don't call him King for no reason. And he is quite the movie monster. But a monster with heart. And the filmmakers make you believe in him. You believe this giant monster really exists. And you also believe he really loves Ann. When the monster's heart breaks your heart breaks for him. The technological wizardry that brings Kong to life is astounding. In 1933 nobody had ever seen anything quite like it. Decades later the effects may seem mundane. But in its time producing this film was a magnificent achievement. You can nitpick and say that King Kong, while certainly a good film, is for this reason or that maybe not a truly great film. But there is no denying that is an absolutely monumental, iconic film. Some great films come and go and end up largely forgotten. Icons live forever. Kong remains King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason why King Kong is considered one of the great classic horror films of the 20th Century, it's really good, and I have to give credit where credit is due. The two stars in Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray were brilliant in King Kong having their characters shine just as much as King Kong. The slow motion animation was very well done between Kong and the dinosaurs and didn't seem tacky like many older films. The story's progression was pristine having spectacular dialogue and a near perfect pace. The reason why the movie isn't a perfect score is a lack of interest at parts. King Kong itself paved ways for many future dinosaur and monster movies and I often think to myself while watching those films how they either rip-off or pay homage to King Kong. The ending makes the viewer glued to the screen and being younger sometimes it's hard for my interest to be held with an older film with English action and outdated camera work, but this was an exception. You gotta see King Kong, the eighth wonder of the world!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot of unique characteristics about King King that make it significant among other monster movies of the era. Unlike Dracula and Frankenstein, King Kong is a giant gorilla rather than a monster appearing as a human. As a result of course the character cannot be played by a human. The fact that king kong is obviously an artificial, toy-looking creation had no negative effect on the films success. The technological limitations are overlooked by the excellent cinematography, lighting, music use, and overall sound effect quality. In fact as far as special effects and cinematography are concerned King Kong triumphs as a film that exceeded the average quality of its time period. In a sense it marks the tradition of elaborate and detailed special effects that is has become a part of what defines action adventure films. Something else that is very unique to King Kong is its application of a common human dilemma into a relationship between a women and an non-human, monstrous, gorilla. Because King Kong becomes infatuated with Ann he breaks from his chains during the show and is inevitably killed as seeks to save her from what he thinks is a threat to her wellbeing. The idea that great infatuation with a forbidden love will yield nothing but bad results is applied to a gorilla. Although seemingly unorthodox this instill some meaning in the plot of the film and makes it that much more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inspirational Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The way I can describe in my own words about the film is that it's a inspiring classic. The acting and characters are great for the time. I think my favorite character in the piece is Carl Denham. He's very enthusiastic and heroic, much more than the main hero. He's determined, he's proud, and most of all adventurous. He's a fun character to be around and will do anything to get his film done, not so much in a villainous way, cause during the film he does care about the safety of others around him. An although he might have gone a bit mad in capturing Kong, he does ultimately consider sympathy for him in the end. Jack Driscol is a very bland character, that's all I can really say about him. Ann, while Fay Wray is the first to poetry the beauty, is okay at least. She does a good job. Though she is very much a damsel in distress, she is strong in her own right, though during her time with Kong, she doesn't do much but scream, which gets a little old and annoying at times. The rest of the characters a well done too. I love Englehorn's old witty personality and Weston, though only in the film for the first 3 minutes, is very memorable to be. But, let's talk about Kong. He is very well portrayed for the first film. A vicarious brutal and sometimes creepy giant monster that you don't feel bad for till the very end. Though not the scariest portrayal in terms of creature designs, but very memorable. The dinosaurs are one of the best things for the movie. The Stegosaurs, Brontosaurus, T-Rex and other creatures are some of the most famous images in the film. I don't think they're has ever been a cooler more awesome fight ever seen on screen than of Kong fighting the T-Rex in the ultimate battle on who is King Of The Jungle. The other fights between The Elasmosaurs and Pteranodon are also awesome sites to be hold. But it's The Empire State Building scene that is the most recognized. I don't think anybody in or has been to New York and seen even an image of that building without seeing a giant ape on top of it battling armed planes holding a girl in his hands. Its so memorable, you wonder how an image like that came about in someone's brain. Well that is the genius non drugged mind of Director Marian C. Cooper, who is in some way's the real life Indiana Jones. His entire life since he was a boy was adventure. And this wasn't just making movies, no, this guy lived in danger and adventure, going on jungle adventures, flying battle planes in WWI and II, and encountering all kinds of wondrous amazing things that you don't really find in the modern world. The Idea of Kong came from his mind after reading a book as a small boy about the first discovery of Mountain Gorilla's where stories about them being giants in their own way, killing people and kidnapping women doing god knows what to them, were I think the inspiration of the beauty and the beast entered his mind. Years later he took the idea to studios in Hollywood. The original idea to film the project was to capture a real gorilla and have it fight a Komoto Dragon with miniature sets, which let's be honest would have been really cool. But many studios passed on the project. Meanwhile an infamous pioneer of stop motion animation, Willis O Brian, was making a film at RKO called Creation, a sequel to The Lost World. The film was going through trouble and had to ultimately be scrapped, but Cooper, who was helping RKO at the time, saw some of O Brians work on the film, and saw it as an opportunity to make his Giant Gorilla movie. Kong was finally green lit, with several titles including The Beast, The Eighth Wonder, King Ape and went through several script drafts, Ill explain those in another video. The cast was assembled and the sets were ready to use, from a recycled production called The Most Dangerous Game. The concept to bring Live Action and Animation together was done with several effects, from rear and miniature screen projection, life size portions of creatures, and putting two pieces of film together. The Stop Motion Animation was pain staking and time consuming. One second of film is 24 frames which could have taken 150 hours to animate a minute of film. The T-Rex Fight took about 6 weeks to complete that is incredible in its own right. Then it went into post production with its music and sound. Murry Spivack had several ideas to vocalize Kong and the other creatures, by combining animal sounds and using his own voice. The music by Max Steiner is amazing and memorable to listen too. The best pieces in my opinion are the opening, the into to skull island, the native dance, and the end piece which leaves a little tear shed for me just in music alone. With all the pieces together, the film was released during the depths of the great depression in 1933 and became an instant classic. The world had never seen anything like it before and was a milestone in special effects. Overall the film is fantastic; everything about the film and how the film was made is great to watch. If there is a film that will get you into making movies, this is a definite watch. If you haven't seen it, you must.</fullReview>

At first, I thought that King Kong was a live action gorilla, but when I saw that he was being animated technologically, it really got my attention. This film was really well put in almost all aspects, even when it comes down to the fight scene near the Empire State Building. I found that interesting. However, not all scenes were good. There was one time when I was scared of seeing Kong fall and die. But the last line did me in. "Oh, no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast!" This film has inspired the other studios to make either shorts and/or movies. This is one of the best.</fullReview>

Lots of people say they don't like it just because it's black and white. I say, "Go watch It! You'll Change Your Mind!"The movie tells of a man named Carl Denham, who needs a girl to star in his latest picture. When he finally finds a girl, named Ann Darrow, he whisks her off to a place called Skull Island. There, the local inhabitants capture her and sacrifice her to their God, Kong. And so starts the amazing, action packed adventure. With no goofs easily spotted, massive dinosaurs, and a glowing New York in the '30s, you're bound to love it. Overall, if you like amazing old horror movies like 'Dracula' (1930), and 'Frankenstein' (1931), then I definitely recommend this amazing movie to YOU!

		<shortDescription>Edgar Wallace and King Kong Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most popular symbols of Hollywood Cinema and in fact some of its definitive moments is the "Giant-Ape-on-Empire-States-Building" formula. It gave to the spectators three well accomplished versions of "King Kong" merchandise - subsequently, in 1933, 1976 and 2005. It brought millions of dollars to known and unknown producers, film distributors, VHS, DVD, Blu Ray, etc. vendors and retailers. However, one thing has been largely forgotten and this is how the idea of King Kong emerged in the entertainment business? Who was Edgar Wallace (1875-1932) and how does it happen that he died in the pre-production period of "King Kong" (1933). Do you really think that such a Movie would have existed without the brilliant mind of Man like Edgar Wallace - larger than life phenomenon whose motto was "Money not spent are Money not worth earning". So I want to communicate here few words about this enthusiastic if rather childish personality.Here we live in 21st century where everybody is bugging something. At the moment I am writing this piece there is an idiot upstairs who is banging on the walls of the apartment just like King Kong did in the movie. He is a schizophrenic and lives in confinement there-in while no one from Community Authorities to Police Force take care because his parents are influential people and are feeding their demented son out of institutional care but are ashamed to admit it. If we, people from 21st century, are not feeling guilty for nothing just because "Atomic War" and "Mutually Assured Destruction" (MAD) is "guarantied-not-to-happen" then how do we expect to understand events and phenomenon some 100 years ago. My writing is supportive of such tone not because I am an abandoned child like Edgar Wallace who skyrocketed to world fame just out of trickle. I am on the contrary very angry because things around us now-a-days don't have face value and they are precarious and monkeying like King Kong in New Yorlk. Let me go to the beef now.I read the article on Edgar Wallace in Wikipaedia and see that it has been a stub. I don't know who are the editors of this on-line encyclopedia but obviously they are working on royalty basis and are not interested to expose the truth and only the truth. Therefore, the material at hand lacks shrewdness and astuteness the way as it should be, since it is obvious that it has used the only workable source on the issue - i.e., Margaret Lane's "Edgar Wallace, The Biography of a Phenomenon" published firstly 1938. I happen to own this rare book and see that all other references are contained within it, save a recent bio-bibliography of the titular. Another valuable source on Edgar Wallace is "Encyclopedia of Mystery and Detection", edited by C. Steinbrunner and O. Penzler, 1st edition (1976), where you can read anything about his numerous plays, films, books and serials. Consequently, one can see that sometime Edgar Wallace was more famous and more important than Conan Doyle (true or false, the legendary creator of Sherlock Holmes was outstripped on narrow margin in the 1920s and 1930s). And if by chance the Anglo-American reader doesn't know - Edgar Wallace, an Englishman, was the first "theoretical" thriller writer who originally draw the plot of a book (provisionally!) and then dictated the story with conversations to the secretary. Very able scheme that allowed him to pace at incredible speed with as little rubbish as possible; truly, he wrote and re-wrote most of his 170 books and scenarios for 10 years in the 1920s. This is a remarkable achievement considering the fact that he was also engaged in variety of other social activities like raising four children, gambling with horse racing (also, owning a personal stall), extravagantly changing several cars and houses, twice being married and divorced (nothing true about his homosexuality), etc, etc.My memories on Edgar Wallace come from a post-totalitarian country in Eastern Europe. The more time has passed in those democratic transition years and the more stupid things have happened in my life. If I had stayed as dissident abroad, maybe, people like me who used to be the cream of Eastern Bloc would have been more useful in the West rather than brooding jobless in their home countries. Happily, I have some saved money to sustain me for my pittance. As I said, because I have too much leisure time I engage in contributing to various free Internet initiatives. Otherwise, I dreamed to become part of world scientific community but life have been drabbing me around just like Edgar Wallace. Poor Devil, he knew that he was unwell but still he went to Hollywood in 1932 to write the scenario for RKO Pictures. Read the book from Margaret Lane, its a marvel. Thank You!P.S. On the outward you can't get an idea who really Edgar Wallace was. I guess no documentaries are left on him but only secondary sources. If you read, however, Margaret Lane's biography on Edgar Wallace and browse the photographic material there you can grasp the real personality - a towering individual and celebrity. I think Alfred Hitchcock imitated the titular in his physical appearance from 1950s and 1960s.</fullReview>

Before any actor in this film ever sets foot on Skull Island, the audience is totally creeped out by the mists, the tall tales, the rumours, the strange goings-on shipboard... by the time we actually see Kong, it is almost anti-climactic. And this was the first film to fully develop the idea of transposing the "beauty and the beast" story to modern horror. What does that ape see in Fay Wray? What does she see in him? That 10,000 cartoonists have redone the final "skyscaper" sequence gives new meaning to "iconic." Un-equalled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing and influential movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really glad I saw this movie, I was stunned by every minute of it. From the incredible musical score, to the special effects, this was so well put together that no wonder it caused all this noise. The story wouldn't pass as a B movie today; the way Kong is treated, the presence of all the dinosaurs and Mesozoic animals and the depiction of the aborigines and the Chinese cook really show that this wasn't really trying to be accurate or even to pass a message (beauty killed the beast doesn't count), but just to be plainly an adventure movie, filled with thrills and awes from the effects. This is very hard to achieve today, because audiences aren't easily impressed anymore with effects, but surprisingly I was tense and amazed all of the time. Even when the ridiculous giant face of Kong appeared (the operated one, that bites entire people in close-ups), it didn't take away the mood. I found myself jumping from the chair from everything that happened, from deaths to battles between Kong and the other beasts. My only complain was from the depiction of some characters, and the apparent utter lack of remorse from imprisoning Kong, however this is totally understandable considering the time this movie was made. This is an amazing movie that deserves its status.Rating: 7/10 (I round ratings down)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A monster of a movie... or is it a movie about a monster?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up on the Peter Jackson version of King Kong. The first time i saw the original i almost died from laughing so hard at how bad the special effects were compared to the blue screen of the new one. But looking back i feel like a fool, because this version reigns supreme. The special effects are absolutely astounding considering they were done 80 years ago. Kong feels like an actually monsters, a very human (and harry) monster. I'm not sure if they used clay-animation or some other form of stop-motion animation for Kong, but whatever they used worked. In terms of narrative, King Kong is a fantastic fantasy/adventure. It's almost hard to think of King Kong as a monster movie when there's such an overwhelming feeling of adventure in this movie. I mean, who wouldn't want to take an adventure to an island where everything can and wants to eat you. Fantasy, adventure, animal cruelty and cross-species relations are all taken to new levels in this classic. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great monster movie but special effects were noticeable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I found this movie to be very enjoyable and somewhat funny. The only reason I say funny is because of the overall idea of a giant ape terrorizing but also falling in love with a woman, the overall plot is rather comical. One thing that I found interesting and funny was that the monsters in the movie were projected on a screen in the background while the actors were running and walking in front of it; I guess that's what you get for special effects during that time but the film didn't look bad and it wasn't really distracting, I just happened to notice. It became obvious during the scene where the ship crew encountered the first dinosaur on their quest to save Ann and they were moving around the dead dinosaur laying on the ground, you can tell that the dinosaur is projected onto a screen and the actors are moving in front of it. But because of this it limits the camera angles to only be shooting in front of the screen to capture the monster and the actors, the camera is not able to really move with the actors as if the monster were chasing them from behind and the camera was shooting in front of them or from the side and moving with them. Maybe unless the actors ran in place or on a treadmill and the camera shot directly in front of them then maybe a good chase scene could be captured, but all in all it would probably be difficult no matter what. It looked the best during the scene where the director and the crew brought the monster to the city to show him off and he escaped from his shackles. When he did escape you could barely tell that the monster was projected onto a screen, it was mostly during the jungle settings where you could tell. Besides that I have no other comments about this movie, the actors were great and the lighting was good because you can easily see everything even in the jungle during night time. I thought it was a good classic monster movie and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was very different than anything that had been done up to this time. It was the first of its kind to use special effects. Of course the special effects are rather dull to people viewing the film now-a-days, but for its time, it was a remarkable break through. The plot of this film has very high suspense and excitement. You wonder what is on the island as the boat pulls up, what is behind the wall, and what giant monster could be lurking in the jungle. I don't necessarily think of King Kong at first when I think of a horror film, but I suppose the suspense of it qualifies it in some ways. This film was definitely a break through for its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is a phenomenally iconic movie. Almost every horror movie can attribute something back to Kong. King Kong used some amazing for its time special effects. Every scene that the monster Kong was in was eerily phenomenal. The special effects, although it looked cheesy to us, was state of the art when it was released. It has an amazing cast, phenomenal acting, an extremely well made ending, and much more. One thing that sticks out to me is the amount of screaming in this movie. Mainly children and women , but men alike as well. And of course Faye Wray, the original scream queen makes very memorable and horrifying scenes. King Kong is very well made and very iconic, forging new and already established methods of film making into one amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved this movie since i was a child my father has a VHS taping of this and i have grown up over the years loving it. i think this brought upon the thought of cgi and how we look at movies today. i love the idea how they put dinosaurs in the movie. It was the only animal in size that could be a fair match up for Kong. i like the movie in when they get to the island how there are being sneekie and trying not to disturb the natives in watching them in there traditions and tribute to kong. I believe the love Kong has for the beauty of the story is the whole message of the story. that love doesn't have any perticular form and Kong dies in the end trying to protect the women even thought he steals her and she never shows that she loves him. The last line of the movie is the true twist to the story. "it was beauty who killed the beast".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is one of those movies that you cannot forget. I'm young so when I think of King Kong, I think of the Hollywood blockbuster over the top King Kong. In fact, after watching this movie, I will never think like that again. King Kong revolutionized the film making era of the time by introducing stop motion animation on a Big Picture scale. Willis O'Brien was the man behind the stop motion animation.King Kong also changed the way jungle/fantasy movies were shot. Before King Kong, story lines were usually, "follow someone into the jungle, and then they stumble upon some outrageous creature and battle them." King Kong changed that. King Kong involved a storyline and had King Kong as the main character, not just some mysterious creature that was found deep in the jungle. At every point, I was wondering what was going to happen next, even if I somewhat knew what it could have been.The major thing that stood out to me was the score (movie music). The music and sounds followed the story PERFECTLY! It really kept me on the edge of my seat.Overall, it was an excellent movie and allowed me to appreciate the King Kong genre much more than I previously did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really love the original King Kong movie. The movie is very thrilling and impacting. The whole concept of a backslidden civilization that lives behind a wall really gets your imagination going. I think that the film was really well made for its time. The way that the film makers portrayed the native people was really believable. Also, the effects in the movie were really impressive. They aren't anything special by today's standards, but audiences must have been blown away when the film was first released. I can't imagine anyone had scene gigantic gorillas fighting prehistoric dinosaurs in any other film at the time. The film has a really immense scope compared to other films I have seen from its period. The story travels across the world and back. There are scenes in the city, on a boat out in the ocean, in a huge jungle, and on top of the empire state building. Kong has become one of the most iconic characters from film and has had immense cultural impact. It is an amazing movie and is one of my all time favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A masterpiece of its time. I'm sure King Kong out did anything anyone has ever seen on the big screen during that time period. A "monster" terrorizing the Big Apple. I hold a place in my heart for this movie. And I know it was fiction but I found it very touching that King Kong was so gentle with Ann (Fay Wray). It kind of reminded me of Jane Goodall, the ape lady. This movie is just another reason that wild animals should be left in the wild, but that's way besides the point of this movie. The point is that everyone should watch King Kong. I think it's an important part of American History, and it really raised the bar on movie making. And I think it set the stage for a whole new meaning of special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the Peter Jackson remake of this film it was interesting to see the original. This film was way ahead of its time and the effects are incredible for the time it was made. This film started the career of Fay Wray who went on to do great things in film. The best scene of the film has to be when he's on the Empire State building and he is being shot at. It is a memorable moment in film and even if you haven't seen the film you know that scene is from KIng Kong. The film is a good length, it is not to short or not to long. Seeing the ape is amazing because you wonder how at that point in film they were able to create such an amazing creature without the use of computers. This film will always be regarded as one of the original horror films and is a must see if you are into the genre. There went on to be other movies in the King Kong series but none can compare to the acting and originality of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong, the great wonder of visual effects! A character so visually beautiful, that we almost forget that it is actually a small model. Anyway, on to my review. King Kong takes place at first in NYC during the worst part of the depression: 1932-1933. We have movie director Carl Denham(played by Robert Armstrong) who wants to make a movie on Skull Island(although, they never call it Skull Island in the film). He finds Ann Darrow(scream-queen Fay Wray)to play the lead in his next film project and then they take a trip the crew will never forget. John Driscoll(Bruce Cabot) who is the hardened 1st mate of the ship, the Venture. The crew arrive on the island where they are greeted by unwelcoming natives who worship Kong. They want to use Ann in compensation for the crew disrupting the ritual. Ann is taken captive and the adventure just starts from there. This film is probably the most groundbreaking film ever made. This is 6 years after the advent of sound, and it is so structured for its time. It has beautiful visual effects done by underrated hero, Wilis O'Brien, a musical score by Max Steiner, and great acting(particularly, Robert Armstrong). This film helped pave the way for future special effects extravaganzas(suck on that Avatar!) Sadly, most people I know hate or just don't like this movie. King Kong, best film ever? Certainly most revolutionary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong is truly groundbreaking, possibly being the father of the whole 'big beast' genre. It is an exciting adventure if the audience can get past the machine-like animals. In my opinion, this use of stop-motion filming doesn't take away from the King Kong experience. I also particularly enjoyed the original score by Max Steiner. It played into and enhanced the drama of the story.King Kong is also amazing when you realize that instead of Kong being a 25 foot ape (highly impractical), the film is shot with him as an 18 foot miniature action figure.However, the real beauty of the film is how the story of Kong makes us fear the beast, but also makes us feel sympathy for him through this tale of unrequited love. The audience becomes so emotionally involved with Kong.The film's strong suit is its animation (groundbreaking at the time, amateur now). Many remakes of King Kong have been done but, naturally, they all pale in comparison to this truly thrilling original classic. This movie has the 'umph' that audiences are looking for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"King Kong" Is Still THE KING!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack co-directed "King Kong" in 1933 and forged the first gargantuan beast on the rampage classic of the sound era. The success of their super-sized simian spectacle sired countless sequels, remakes, and imitations, notably "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" (1953), "Godzilla" (1954), and "Gorgo" (1961). "King Kong" qualified as a New Deal in film-making. Nobody had made a movie about mammoth monsters since Harry Hoyt's landmark silent epic "The Lost World" (1925), based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel about an expedition into an imaginary land of dinosaurs. Cooper and Schoedsack hired special effects technician O'Brien, who had pioneered the stop-motion behemoths for "The Lost World," to create their eponymous protagonist. During the 1930s and the 1940s, Hollywood filmmakers produced a number of movies about murderous apes. For example, Robert Florey helmed the risqu Edgar Allan Poe film "Murders in the Rue Morgue" (1932) about a mad scientist who wants to find a white woman as a bride for his ape."King Kong" opens at night in New York Harbor. Aboard the Venture, Captain Englehorn (Frank Reicher of "Topaze") warns Denham they must soon weigh anchor. "Insurance company found out we're carrying explosives the Marshal will be aboard tomorrow or the next day." Denham fears if word leaks about the cargo, they'll be tied up for months. "With enough ammunition to blow up the harbor," Englehorn complains, "What do you think the marshal will say to these new gas bombs of yours? Denham brags that he must have a starlet "because the public, bless them, must have a pretty face to look at." He complains, "Isn't there any romance and adventure in the world without having a flapper in it?" The critics have told Denham that a love interest will generate twice as many receipts. "Alright, the public wants a girl, and I'm going to give them what they want." Denham leaves the ship to search for a suitable woman for his film. He discovers a starving girl, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), who once worked as an extra in movies. A Times Square fruit vendor accuses Ann of stealing an apple. Denham pays for the apple, dissuades the vendor from taking legal action, and buys Ann a meal at all-night diner.As the Venture leaves New York, Ann approaches rough-hewn Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot of "Dodge City"), on deck where he clobbers her accidentally. Their relationship gets off to a rocky start. "I guess you don't think much of women on ship?" Ann says. "Women on ships," Jack shrugs, "No, they're a nuisance." Denham joins them on deck. Interestingly, Ann takes an interest in a little monkey called Iggy. She kneels to pet the spider monkey in what constitutes an ironic reversal on what happens to her when she encounters King Kong on Skull Island. Denham observes, "Beauty and the beast." Meanwhile, Jack denies his love for Ann his infatuation in front of Denham. "You think I'm going to fall for any dame?" Denham knows better. "Some big hard-boiled egg gets a look, he cracks up and goes sappy. You're a pretty tough guy but if beauty gets you, I'm going right into a theme song here." Denham outlines his picture. "The beast was a tough guy, too. He could beat the world, but when he saw beauty, she got him. He went soft. He forgot his wisdom and the little fellas licked him." The Venture enters a thick, eerie fog bank surrounding Skull Island. Denham and company enter a village in the middle of a ceremony. The natives argue that their ceremony has been spoiled because of the appearance of these intruders. The chieftain and his followers spot Ann with her blond hair and demand that the whites make a gift of her to them for Kong.Safely back aboard the Venture, Denham and company relax. Later, they discover that the Skull Island natives sneaked aboard the Venture and abducted Ann so she can serve as their gift to King Kong. Englehorn arms the crew. The natives lash Ann to an altar. Forty-seven minutes into the film, we see King Kong's makes his initial appearance. He claims Ann as his prize and Denham and company pursue him.Denham is reluctant to leave Skull Island without Kong. "We came here to get a moving picture and we found something worth more than all the movies in the world." No sooner do Jack and Ann appear than King Kong charges into sight. They shut and barricade the huge gates. Eventually, Kong breaks down the doors, chomps on three natives, knocks over a platform with warriors hurling spears at him, and crushes two natives under his foot. Denham resorts to a gas bomb to knock out Kong.At this point, "King Kong" leaps forward to New York City as ushers lead patrons who paid $20 a ticket to get in and see the giant ape. Jack and Ann are backstage with Denham and the press and Kong secured to a huge platform with chrome steel chains. Denham unveils Kong to the packed house. "He was a king and a god in the world he knew but now he comes to civilization merely a captive, a show to gratify your curiosity." The photographers' flashbulbs set off King Kong. Kong breaks free of his restraints, stampedes out of the theater, grabs Ann and heads for the Empire State Building.Four bi-planes equipped with multiple machine guns soar off to the Empire State Building. Kong sets Ann aside and slaps the air at the planes as the gunners pour hails of gunfire into his humongous hulk of a body to no apparent effect. Weakened by the loss of blood, King Kong loses his grip on the tower and plummets to the earth. Carl Denham makes his way through the crowd and gazes at the corpse of the gorilla. He provides a memorable eulogy for Kong's demise: "It was beauty killed the beast."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful adventure story classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carl Denham is a filmmaker looking to film his new movie in an exotic setting. He hires adventurer Jack Driscoll to come along on the trip and brings the lovely Ann Darrow as his leading lady. Their destination is Skull Island, a mysterious place of unknown terrors and full of monsters. The natives on the island kidnap Ann as a sacrifice to Kong, the giant ape who "rules" the island. Kong, carrying Ann, disappears into the jungle, hotly pursued by her ship mates who encounter all sorts of strange and deadly monsters. And then the real adventure begins.King Kong must have been an ambitious project for the 1930's. It has huge and elaborate settings, a large cast, extensive use of stop motion photography and other special effects and an overall feeling of grandeur. As a big monster adventure fantasy story, it doesn't get any better than this. King Kong is well regarded as a classic and it continues to stand up to the test of time. The attention to detail in this film is just wonderful.Fay Wray is just lovely as the down on her luck Ann Darrow, Bruce Cabot is the strong "hero" type and plays the role well, and Robert Armstrong becomes his character as the adventurous, flamboyant and reckless film maker. The other supporting actors also perform well.But a lot of the magic of this movie is in how well King Kong himself is portrayed. The character is created so well that one could believe it is real and is a very sympathetic one. The tenderness of the beast in dealing with Ann Darrow, the stop motion battles with dinosaurs and snakes, the expression in his eyes, all contribute to the magnificence of this creature.The plot is simple but effective and the action moves along at a good clip that is appropriate for the action and adventure story that it is. But there is a big build up of suspense through this film too, and it takes almost forty minutes before we even get a glimpse of the great ape. I also found the musical scores to be well choreographed with the action appearing on screen.Overall, this is a great adventure and deserves its classic reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kong is still king!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is still very exciting to watch, which is quite unusual for a movie that is 75 year old. Normally these old type of adventure movies are sort of clumsy made and silly to view but "King Kong" is genuine exciting, tense and entertaining. It easily is still one of the most entertaining movies ever made. Can you just imaging how people must have experienced this movie back in 1933. It must have been an amazing experience. The first halve of the movie is mostly used to build up the tension and whole mystery of the Kong character. The beast doesn't show up until well halve way through the movie. And of course when he finally does make his appearance, the movie gets all the better, exciting adventurous, not in the least thanks to its fine early special effects. The movie then really turns into some non-stop entertainment, when the crew and also Kong battle all kinds of different and large and dangerous looking other creatures on Skull Island.The movie is not only made adventurous by just its story or the character of Kong and other large creatures that show up and its special effects but also thanks to its exotic settings and grand looking original sets.Of course the movie gets all the more spectacular from the moment they leave Skull Island and bring Kong with them back to New York. Just when you think you have seen it all and the movie can't get any better and bigger, the New York finale comes. Not hard to see why the Empire State Building sequences is such a classic one. It's more than just a sequence, it over the years has sort of become a movie icon.It's a highly original movie, especially for 1933, because of course of its concept of having a giant ape as the movie its central character. It makes this a very unique movie. It's a movie that created a whole new sort of genre. Monster movies weren't new but having an 15 feet-like monster, causing a total mayhem and leaves a path of destruction sure was something new.The movie also works our highly effective thanks to its fine musical score by Max Steiner, which is sort of underrated.The acting and dialog is at times sort of silly and bad. Yes, even for 1933 standards. It's perhaps the only real thing that isn't perfect about this movie. Especially Bruce Cabot is quite dreadful and Fay Wray might had been a great scream-queen but she wasn't a real great actress. The best performance is given by Robert Armstrong who plays the movie director Carl Denham.Kong is truly still king, on his 75th anniversary!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Is Still The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stop-motion animation was invented long before movies learned to talk. In the mid-1920s Willis O'Brien became the first great master of the form, and in 1925 THE LOST WORLD became the first feature-length film to display it. The film was a sensation, but the stop-motion process was laborious and extremely expensive. The early 1930s found O'Brien at RKO, where he worked on a stop-motion film tentatively titled CREATION. As the Great Depression deepened, however, studio executives became increasingly wary of the cost involved and ultimately canceled the project.This would have likely been the end of O'Brien's career--but for a quirk of fate. Production partners Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, famous for such exotic films as GRASS, CHANG, and THE FOUR FEATHERS, had arrived at the studio, and Cooper had a fantasy project: a movie about a gorillas. When Cooper saw O'Brien's footage for the scuttled CREATION, he had a brainstorm that would become one of the most celebrated films of the decade: KING KONG.Much of KING KONG's fascination arises from O'Brien's stop-motion animation process. At the time, it was the only way in which a film such as KING KONG could be realized, and the frame-by-frame animation process is "hand made" in a classic sense; adding to this fascination are the models themselves, beautifully rendered, and the miniature sets they inhabited. But KING KONG would go quiet a bit further than stop-motion; it was made with considerable technical creativity, a film of rising technology that utilized everything from rear-projection to in-camera processes to laboratory techniques. It captures a sort of critical mass in state of the art of its era.1933 audiences reacted to the film with amazement--and much may be said for contemporary audiences, albeit for considerably different reasons. Where 1933 audiences found the film frightening real, modern viewers are stunned by the meticulous detail of its pre-digital accomplishment. But if KING KONG were only a window on past cinematic technology, it would not be as widely embraced today as it is.The film has considerable merit in its directness, its pace, its score, its cast, its script, and the way in which the overall setting for O'Brien's stop-motion animation operates. It has tremendous charm, a strangely innocent quality, and it deals in archetypes that boil in our culture as powerfully today as they did more than seventy years ago. But most particularly, O'Brien and his artists and technicians succeed in endowing Kong with personality, and even today we relate to Kong in an emotional way.The recent double disk "collector's tin" package as a great deal going for it. KING KONG is one of the most frequently censored films in Hollywood history, with bits removed in virtually every re-release. With the exception of the "Spider Pit" sequence, which is likely forever lost, these cuts have been restored, and the quality of the restored cuts is as fine as the quality of the picture as a whole, something not always the case in previous video tape releases. As for the visual quality of the release, it is quite fine indeed, easily the best I have seen. Some complain that the sound has not been bumped into stereo, but I have no complaints on this point; KING KONG was filmed before the advent of stereo recording, and we hear it here very much as audiences heard it in 1933.The "collectors tin" is quite nice and the various paper items are enjoyable, but the bonus DVD material is of mixed quality. Two documentaries are available, and both "I'm King Kong!: The Exploits of Merian C. Cooper" and "RKO Production 601: The Making of Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World" are quite good. I found the latter particularly interesting inasmuch as it demonstrates how difficult modern film makers found it to reproduce the stop-motion animation process used in the 1933 film. Peter Jackson, director of the 2005 remake, also spearheads a recreation of the lost "Spider Pit" sequence to extremely interesting effect, and stop-motion master Ray Harryhausen offers commentary on the surviving and very interesting snip of the aborted CREATION.Unfortunately, the audio commentary is chiefly remarkable for being utterly dismal. Archival comments by Merian C. Cooper are interesting, but Ken Ralston clearly has only very superficial knowledge of the film and effectively leads Ray Harryhausen away from making any interesting remarks of his own. As for archival comments by Fay Wray, you'll have to pay very close attention to catch them; they are so short and so insignificant that it seems likely the producers of this package included them only in order to put her name in the commentary line-up.This seems a tremendous pity, for Wray gave numerous interviews over the years concerning KING KONG; it is an opportunity missed. But most shocking of all, once again Willis O'Brien gets the short end of the stick. He figures prominently in the two documentaries, but he is never given the same level of interest as Cooper. It is an opportunity lost. But even with such drawbacks to the overall package, KING KONG remains KING KONG. One can only hope there will be a more comprehensive package in the future. Until then, we will have to make do--and with such a beautiful print of the film itself, "making do" is a pleasure.GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone I know for some strange reason likes the Peter Jackson remake better than this. I mean, just because something has Oscr-winning special effects doesn't make it an instant classic! This 1933 version (directed by Merrian C. Cooper who produced Western classic The Searchers) is the real jewel of the crown. The superb acting, even the special effects are superb by todays standards (in my opinion, that is.) I was amazed when Robert Armstrong or Bruce Cabot weren't nominated for Best Actor (special effects award I could understand, because it didn't exist yet.) It's an excellent film. Period. I own the DVD for this film for crying out loud! Films like Jaws and others prove that you don't need fancy, top-notch, special effects to make a classic, and King Kong is now reinforcing it still, especially the infamous scene where gets the better of a T. Rex, snapping it's jaws in half, is still a classic scene in my mind. No mater how many people think the remake was better, this Kong will still be King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #082: King Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>082: King Kong (1933) - released 3/2/1933, viewed 1/09/07.The 20th Amendment goes into effect. An attempt on Franklin Roosevelt's life by Guiseppe Zangara instead kills Chicago mayor Anton J. Cermak. Newsweek magazine hits the stands for the first time. The Blaine Act ends Prohibition in the U.S. The Reichstang Fire Decree is passed in Germany.BIRTHS: Kim Novak, Yoko Ono, Nina Simone.KEVIN: Before 'Star Wars,' before 'Lord of the Rings,' 'King Kong' was the ultimate geek movie and the mother of all high-concept genre films. This is the movie that 'Island of Lost Souls' wished it had been. Today, films like this are made literally all the time. But in 1933, with the technology available, such entertainment was exquisitely rare, and never, EVER this good. You really have to appreciate how demented Cooper and Schoedsack must have been to even come up with this movie. The idea of seeing giant monsters and dinosaurs interacting with live-action elements was a pipe-dream back then, but the makers of this film knew it just HAD to be done. It is not that strange that the titular monster doesn't appear until halfway into the movie. Unlike the humanoid Universal monsters, you really can't just come right out with a creation like Kong; you've got to start firmly in the real world, work up to him, and build the anticipation until things explode into unrelenting excitement. Fortunately for us, the human actors do all they can to hog the screen before Kong crowds them out. Robert Armstrong is so deliciously hammy as Carl Denham, especially during those exposition scenes ("Have you ever heard of?Kong?"). And let's not forget Bruce Cabot's lumbering chauvinist skipper Jack Driscoll. When we watched this movie with a class, Driscoll's admission to Ann, "Hey, I think I love you," got the biggest laugh of the semester. I often thought, "I could probably write more interesting dialogue, but?why?" After they've had their fun, Kong muscles his way in, and the action never stops for a second. Although Willis O'Brien's legendary stop-motion techniques give Kong his unmistakable emotional richness, Kong is still essentially a monster that needs to be put down. He rampages through the city killing and eating innocent people while destroying everything in sight. Unlike the 2006 remake, Ann doesn't sympathize with him, but is instead just like every other damsel of the day and wants to be far away from the danger (but never quite succeeds). No one in the movie feels any real sympathy for him, except for us in the audience, which is what's so brilliant about it; we are the ones who know he's not real, and we're the only ones who feel bad when he dies.DOUG: 'Kong Kong' is the 82nd film on the Odyssey, and historically it is probably the most famous one thus far (Frankenstein and Dracula come close). 'King Kong' is best remembered, and deservedly so, for its title character, a new plateau of special effects in 1933. This has the most extensive special effects we've seen since The 'Thief of Baghdad.' Willis O'Brien was the brains behind making Kong move. Stop motion was still a very experimental process, and trying to animate a living creature had never been done on this level. Besides Kong, many other monstrous creatures (mostly dinosaurs) appear on film in protracted special effects sequences (some, like a carnivorous Apatosaurus, are depicted inaccurately from pending archaeological findings). Likewise, the music by Max Steiner was extremely pivotal and groundbreaking, composed and synchronized to match the action very specifically (they called it "Mickey Mousing" because it was only done in cartoons at that time). Up to this point, the music we've seen in the movies we've watched is either generic or nonexistent. Viewers unfamiliar with the film's significance may miss the music when they watch it here. All these fond memories and pivotal advances in technology allow the film to shine in spite of its flaws in other areas. The characters are flat, and most of the dialogue is just terrible. When Jack turns to Ann early in the movie and is like, "Hey, I think I love you," my whole class erupted with laughter. It's all mostly just setup for the action and the effects. Kong ends up being the most interesting character, and he's a stop-motion puppet. When watched cold, the special effects are quite hokey and campy. When watched in context, the effects are really extraordinary, combining all manner of stop-motion, rear projection, and trick photography; the fight between Kong and the T-Rex still holds up. Even if it is seven decades dated, Kong himself is a marvelous example of special effects; you actually feel for him. Anything that can be done with CGI today is useless if it can't measure up to the emotional weight of the original Kong. The "relationship" between Kong and Ann is an exercise in primal animal magnetism. Scenes such as when Kong curiously peels off Ann's clothes, or drops an innocent woman out onto the street when he finds that she isn't Ann, are some delicious pre-Code delights. I can't decide if the best human performance belongs to Robert Armstrong's Carl or Fay Wray's Ann. I think Armstrong turns in the superior performance; he has a lot more dialogue, most of it expository, and he has to pretty much sell the movie to the audience. Wray has a lot of scenes with Kong, and has to do a lot of screaming (which she's very good at). On the DVD features, Peter Jackson and the rest of the gang are on hand to gush about the movie and break down nearly every special effects shot. One thing becomes clear in these featurettes: before 'Star Wars' came out 44 years later, the Ultimate Geek Film was 'King Kong.' Last film: 42nd Street (1933). Next film: Gabriel Over the White House (1933).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charming for special effects and for the construction of tale. For the science to reflect fundamental values and for the game of illusions. For a subtle and innocent art of old-fashion Hollywood and for ecological message. In fact, a nostalgic remember of Utopian golden age. Same characters, same ethics, same atmosphere. A piece of "Tarzan" tradition with special gift to reflect the reality.It is a film important for his apparition's year. The tension of world, the rumors about war, Germany or the ash of illusion are elements of movie's recipes. The new "King Kong" is a technical miracle, fruit of Lucas era but, this artless, childish, nice image of god- monster,beauty, fight and freedom is more profound and lyrical.So, a touching movie and picture of a lost era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The absolute greatest movie of all time. It has everything action adventure, monsters, and a love story. Kong used ground breaking special effects for that era, and is the cornerstone of special effects today. A classic in its own right rated 43 on AFI's top 100 films of all time. You can't help but root for Kong. Kong develops as a character as the film moves forward that you can't help but love. King Kong was remade in 2005 by Director Peter Jackson who payed much respect in following the original but before seeing the remake I strongly suggest you see the original. Go out and rent it. King Kong is a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly great, classic adventure story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time on TV in the mid 1970s as a child, then some more times on TV later in the 1970s and early 1980s. We then brought a copy on VHS in 1983, and from then through the mid 1990s I often watched it on our VCRs. But the very first time I saw it I immidiently loved it, and this continued each time I saw it from then on. It was always one of my favorite movies of all time, and since the late 1980s has been my 7th favorite movie. I remember the special VHS tape of it that came out in December, 1992 for its 6oth anniversary, and the book I got and read in 1977, and after wards, The King Kong Story. The atmosphere, thrills, suspense, dinosaur fights and attacks, and the overall action of it all come together so well, and the special effects are very convincing (even for 1933). There is little drama, but this movie wasn't meant for that, it was meant to deliver nonstop action and thrills, which it more than succeeds in doing. I do wish the spider pit sequence had been left in it, but in November it came on DVD for the first time, and I definitely plan to watch it on that as soon as get the chance (and look forward to Peter Jackson's replacement of this).</fullReview>

I guess you all know the story of Kong,but it is one of the most influential movies of all time and without a doubt the finest fantasy film ever. I know that the Lord of the Rings trilogy are true works of art and deserve all of the plaudits placed upon them.But would they ever have been made if Peter Jackson hadn't become so obsessed with making movies after he had seen the original King Kong?Just ask Steven Spielberg or Ray Harryhausen how much they owe to Kong.It is still a great movie to watch today,even after over seventy years. Yes,the acting can be a little hammy(especially Robert Armstrong) and Fay Wray does scream a lot.But this is a movie that straddles time and features some of the most memorable sequences ever. Take a well earned bow Kong,you have really earned it.</fullReview>

The name of the island is "Skull Island" contains a tribe of natives who worship their God figure: Kong. Every time they preform a ceremony they choose a woman as a sacrifice to Kong's hunger.Little does our crew know is that the Island's God is none other than a Giant Ape, stronger than 40 men put together. Instead of shooting a film the Director decides to capture Kong and present to him on Broadway in New York. As the 8th Wonder of the World! This is one of the best films of the 30s. It has some cool stuff to it including, a Giant Ape, Adventure, Action, and a memorable climax ending.The special effects are very ancient in this film. A large use of stop-motion animation for Kong and some other creatures. Those who like B rated Movies or old school Monster flicks, then King Kong will surly be your kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is an excellent film and so is the new Kong film. The only problem i have with any of the Kong films is the 1976 version which the story to is all wrong. But i thought what does that matter if its all wrong. Then they went and missed out the T-Rex scene which they even had in the 1933 version which didn't even have as good graphics then. But the worst thing about it is that he doesn't even climb the Empire State Building which i thought made it the worst of all three original Kong films, and how did Kong not die falling from that height straight away. But i supposed its not the worst film i ever saw i mean Kong Vs Godzilla looks completely fake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A special effects tour de force that was a legitimate blockbuster long before the term was ever coined by Hollywood. Once you get past landmark visual effects though we have a hopelessly dated film that almost seems like it would have been better as an animated feature. Struggling New York actress Fay Wray is persuaded by fast-talking film director Robert Armstrong to accompany him and a ship's crew (led by Bruce Cabot) to a mythical place only known as Skull Island. Naturally there are dangers aplenty with wild natives, prehistoric beasts and oft-times cornball acting. A romance blossoms between Cabot and Wray just as Wray is about to become a sacrifice to the titled character and we all know the rest. More proof that New York City is truly the greatest jungle of them all. Tongue-in-cheek all the way today, "King Kong" works due to unheard of and unseen movie-making techniques of the period that admittedly started technological innovations that are still prevalent today. Landmark for its visual and sound advancements. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the greatest movie that made a lasting impression to me... unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I saw the movie the very, very first time... I was eight years old, and I was just so amazed when I watched "King Kong." By that time, I never thought any movie would beat the fantastic impression I got by that movie. I completely loved it, the movie magic was so real, unfalse and so tremendous. It was an amazing experience. To have watched such a movie when I was eight really made a lasting impression to my growing movie interest. It is sure one of the very first movies that made me a movie buff today. I love movies, I love making movies, just because of that movie and other movies that I saw by that time. I think that I have got the fortunate to have watched such great movies by that age, because I am sure that if I had just watched kid movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito, my interest in movies had been very different today.Since then, I haven't watched it again. I haven't dared to try give it another try, because I want to beware the first memory of the movie... for now.I remember the boat shipping to the island, the woods, the Indian dancing around the king Kong and the movie producers with the blonde actor Fay Wray getting caught in King Kong's arms, making him falling in love with her... how he later gets caught... and how he made the famous climbing to the top of Empire State Building. It is these things that I will never forget, these things that made me love movies. King Kong... it is a very tremendous movie, a movie that nobody should underestimate or even call a nasty movie. It is one of the greatest movies made of all time, because it was such a tremendous, such an amazing movie for its time... and still today, because we are so amazed how the movie could have been made in 1933. Yeah, the picture quality is not of the best compared to present movies, but it is one of the things that made King Kong... King Kong. Without this, it hadn't been famous. It hadn't been a classic. It hadn't made Peter Jackson a movie director. It is an evidence how meaningful a movie can be, because it can influence so many lives, whether you want it or not. However, I am sure that there are also people who don't get the point of King Kong. I respect them for that. Everybody can't have caught the magic, the important message of the movie... Some were really impressed by the magic, others not. It is the truth. It is what happens with all the other movies too. It is nothing special.But to me, King Kong will forever be the very very first favorite movie of mine. It is still a favorite movie, even if I haven't watched it once since then. I still want to beware the magic, the memory.</fullReview>

The visual effects that allowed us to see Kong wrestle dinosaurs and rampage through New York remained unequaled for decades.

		<shortDescription>A classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From time to time Hollywood manages to put together a movie that is not just a commercial product but is actually a work of art, and this is one of those movies. This movie easily could have become little more than a laughable joke, but that is not the case here. This movie is a fantasy about what happens when a majestic creature who is king of his realm is attacked, kidnapped, bound up in chains, and transported to a totally alien environment. The results are sad and tragic. By nature Kong is not wantonly violent, but once placed among people, he is doomed for destruction. Kong's relationship to the beautiful Anne Darrow is one of a protector defending his doll-like friend against all foes, human or otherwise. But the real star of the movie (besides Kong) is Robert Armstrong as Carl Denholm. Mr. Armstrong's performance must rate as one of the great performances in the history of Hollywood movies. There have been, and no doubt will be, remakes of this movie. They will be flashier and be much more expensive, but the essential story and the acting will never be surpassed because this movie is a true one-of-a-kind classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rama Kong! Classic adventure fantasy that showed the potential of the medium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an art medium, film has two extremes--the Lumiere brothers' real life documentary approach and George Melies' quest to create the fantastic. Kong was and remains the earliest best example of what the latter school of film could do.Forget the dodgy dialogue and acting--this film was all about the action and effects, and I admire the almost joking way the Ann Darrow, Jack Driscoll relationship is handled. Quick and artificial.This is all about Kong!Kong represents something truly unique in world film, a violent, speechless and sympathetic title character in a live action story that is entirely the result of special effects--E.T. was basically a man in a suit, and Gollum was a man in suit, though digitally assisted. Kong is both monster and victim--and the filmmakers were aware of that otherwise why would Max Steiner's score(rare at the time) take on a sympathetic turn as Kong nears his end?Ultimately though--the real stars are animators Willis O'Brien, modelmakers Marcel and Victor Delgado, and the other fx crew who worked with limited funds and technology to fill the screen with every possible visual treat.The way the dinosaurs breath from football bladders of compressed air? How about the birds flying out of Kong's lair? Or the way live action and stop motion animation are mashed together? How about the shot where Kong drops Ann into a tree--a stop motion puppet and a real human being together? This sort of effect wasn't matched until CGI, many decades later. The optical printer, a device essential for films like 2001 and Star Wars, was invented for this movie--and the filmmakers didn't even patent it!It is fun to watch this movie after seeing the Most Dangerous Game, which involved many of the same players and even a few of the sets, since the filming of Kong took 3 years. The kind of enthusiasm that existed for the makers of Kong just doesn't exist anymore.A couple of notes on Jackson's remake. He said he had to remake it because people don't watch black and white films anymore. That alone is no reason to remake Kong. King Kong is a simple story that could only work as a movie--it isn't Shakespeare, and remaking it suggests that people should avoid the original. This does a disservice to all those who worked on the 1933 film. And it smacks of a Kong-sized ego.Furthermore, the CG Kong is made to look like a giant gorilla. But isn't be more of a prehistoric ape? In that sense I like the wild-eyed spider-monkey/gorilla of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not widely known but very important to note that Willis O'Brien was the genius that pioneered the use of the revolutionary technique "Stop Motion Animation" to create the statuesque Kong for the film. By creating a Puppet with a metal armature and moving it slightly and exposing it to one frame of film then moving it slightly and repeating the process over and over the illusion of motion could be created. Ray Harryhausen who is sometimes mistakenly credited with the work on Kong would later be mentored by O'Brian in the creation of the creature effects for Mighty Joe Young. Harryhausin would go on to become the name synonymous with the stop motion technique but would always owe his start to the visionary Willis O' Brian.</fullReview>

The Sea Monster and Terror of Mecha Godzilla over and over again (man those were the days). I went out and bought a documentary on Godzilla and other movie monsters and it showed clips from this wonderful movie and I immediately found myself in love with the stop animation giant ape that is King Kong. After seeing and loving King Kong Vs. Godzilla, I became a huge Kong freak and bought the first movie along with Son of Kong both on VHS. I have a lot of memories about my first few viewings of King Kong from when I was younger and I always loved anything to do with the mighty ape. Seeing my favorite movie monster battling numerous dinosaurs and swatting at airplanes all for the one he loved was very touching and even though the acting could have been better, it's worth sitting through just for the awesome action scenes which i will never get tired of. I now have the Two-Disc Special Edition on DVD (along with Son of Kong and Mighty Joe Young) so I can watch this black and white masterpiece again and again. I really look forward to seeing the 2005 remake which looks very promising but will never add up to the original. This amazing piece of art gets a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

The story is really compelling,one of the best and most tragic romances of all time(the Beauty &amp; The Beast parallels are obvious but gripping),the sets are impressive,considering the movie is from 1933,and the actors,particularly Robert Armstrong as excessively ambitious director Carl Denham,are very good.However,there are two things that struck me the most: First,the unforgettable climax,so astounding that only The Simpsons would be able to successfully reference/spoof it; Second,the visual effects.It isn't Jurassic Park, but Kong and the other creatures which inhabit Skull Island are still convincing after more than half a century.If a kid watches this film,he might still get scared.King Kong is a must-see if you're a hardcore film-buff.Suggestion:watch it alongside the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Why? Because: A.If Peter Jackson hadn't seen this memorable film when he was 8,he wouldn't have become a movie director,and therefore not made the outstanding Tolkien adap; B.Jackson's remake of this classic is on its way and,judging from what I've seen so far,it's gonna repay the viewing as much as the original.</fullReview>

Despite its advanced age, black &amp; white, and primitive special effects, this is one of the most effective movie thrillers ever made. That's because the movie makers knew how to tell a story and evoke awe and fear without using the effects as a crutch. A modern example would be "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind:" to a certain extent, it doesn't really matter how perfect the spaceship effects were (and, dare I say it, they look dated even now.) Please, get out and vote this movie up to where it really deserves to be! I'm eagerly looking forward to Peter Jackson's update of this movie, by the way - but I have a feeling and hope that Jackson will push people to see the original with new eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Rolls Royce" of Horror Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a thrill-packed monster movie that has achieved cult-classic status. The imaginative and skillful special effects are outstanding (considering that this film was released some 70 years ago), setting the standard for countless action/adventure films to follow. The story of the giant ape who is captured and transported from the jungle to contemporary New York City shows similarities to the fairy tale "Beauty And The Beast". The now legendary scenes with King Kong and a terrified Fay Wray, along with the closing remarks "...it was Beauty that killed the Beast" will stay with the viewer as a powerful commentary on society and its norms.This is clearly the greatest cinematic achievement in the genre of horror movies. This classic ranks with "Bride of Frankenstein" and the original "Dracula" as the leader in this art form. A must-see for any horror film enthusiast. The 1988 Laser Disc and the recently released DVD version are the ultimate experience in viewing this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably still the most famous monster movie of all time, a genuine classic of effects and technical skill, and one which can still entertain newcomers today.King Kong tells the story of a group of explorers, journalists, and scientists who embark on a voyage to a mysterious island. There they find amongst dinosaurs and other giant beasts, but ruling over all, including the natives is a giant ape. Carl Denham decides to capture the ape and bring it back to New York as his new spectacle, reviving his fortunes. When the beautiful actress Ann is kidnapped by the natives who plan to sacrifice her to Kong, the group of explorers must rescue her, and steal Kong. Jack Driscoll leads the way, and most of his group are killed before he saves Ann. Kong is taken back to America, but it seems his strength has been underestimated and he has fallen in love with the actress. Soon he is free and wreaking havoc throughout the city.The effects for the time were stunning, and are still impressive today, with a flawless attention to detail being shown. The fights between Kong, dinosaurs, men, and airplanes are all awesome and provide some of the most iconic images in movie history. The Empire State Building finale is one of the most famous moments ever, and the log scene is still shocking today. Some of the acting is poor and the story, though simple has become a classic which many have copied since. Of course when you realise this was made over 70 years ago, naturally some things will have dated, such as the acting and some cheesy dialogue, but for audiences at the time it must have been a very tense and exciting time. Kids should be allowed to watch this at an early age as they will appreciate the story and remember the visuals before they see all the effects extravagances of the modern age, which could spoil their opinions of past greats such as this. Undoubtedly a classic.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

The original beauty and the beast classic richly deserves a place on the all-time greats lists as an documentary crewgoes on a expedition to Skull Island to recover a large ape for a large exhibition in New York City. Brilliantly delivers with Willis O' Brien's stop-motion animation effects and final sequence atop Empire State Building is one of cinema's memorable and unforgettable momments.

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I was about 9. 40 years later I still rave and watch it every time it is on. The sheer heart this movie has astounds me. After studying everything I could get my hands on about this gem I remain amazed. Yes, the acting is off base - but that works here where it didn't in the '76 remake. The special effects, though crude by today's standards, were state of the art then and still convey more character than today's output. At times the level of detail applied to some of the scenes is truly inspiring - and then you are reminded of the erring human factor by some bleed-through or camera/boom shadows. Most people miss them anyway so it doesn't matter. The battles Kong has are still the best fights scenes ever filmed. Next to Kong vs. Allosaurus, the Spinosaurus vs. Tyrannosaurus in 'Jurassic Park III' is a no-show. The sound effects are still awesome 70 years later. The mood setting musical score nails it right on the head. On and on and on. A perfectly paced little nugget. For its flaws I can't give it a 10. For its longevity and soul I give it a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an amazing achievement in cinematic slight of hand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong is the first movie I remember seeing as a child at the age of 12 on a Saturday afternoon watching tv over my grand mom's. The most amazing thing about the film ( for me ),was how much these talented filmmakers got me to care about this giant ape , which was in reality only 18 inches tall. As a child, I wanted Kong to kill all the monsters , mainly the T Rex and live happily ever after with his pretty blonde bride( Fay Wray)..It doesn't end that way. I won't tell how it does. As an adult , King Kong is one of the few films from my child hood that still entertains me. Yes this film is slow at times and it even has dated dialogue but for me,that adds to the film ( when I was a kid I used to quote the film). How ever,after the action starts and Kong makes his entrance the film really picks up pace and Willis O'brien's animation takes over one doesn't get time to ponder out dated dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers within.Notice Fay Wray on the ship. Where she practice in front of the director. It is an exciting scene, and it works well here. We saw a similar scene more recently with Naomi Watts.That type of scenes seems to function so well and I don't believe it is because the performer stands out in that particular scene. But it's because the actor is performing a scene in a scene, in the movie. And that makes us focus on the the actors performance rather than the situation. It obviously takes a good actor to make that work. Indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long live the 'King' of monster films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groundbreaking monster film has a group of adventurers on an uncharted tropical island to photograph "something monstrous.neither beast nor man." That is where they discover a gorilla named King Kong. They want to bring Kong back to New York for exhibition, so they use a blond woman (Faye Wray) as bait. Once in the Big Apple, the big ape goes amok. The final showdown leads Kong atop of the Empire State Building.Compared to films of today, the 1933 monster film did not rely on CGI effects and a hefty budget of $100 million to entertain. The effects may seem outdated, but they look a lot better than the big budget films like "Jurassic Park" and "Spiderman." During that era, the only importance was acting, plot and attention to detail.Throughout the years more monster films have evolved, but hardly came close to this beauty and the beast classic. "Godzilla" could barely measure up as it was about some lizard tearing up Japan. Then there's the 1976 remake of this film, but did no better other than get a Special Achievement Award for visual effects. This film even inspired Nintendo to create the video game "Donkey Kong." Pushing 70, this film has aged well. My evaluation: **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think King Kong is the best movie ever made. I first saw this when I was about 6 years old and has had an impact on me ever since. As well as Fay Wray and Kong himself, the other major stars of this movie are of course Willis O'Brien's stop-motion dinosaurs which include a T-Rex and a Brontosaurus. These are very impressive, as are the special effects in general. Some scenes from this movie were cut as they were deemed too horrific in the day. Most prints that exist today have thankfully had these restored, although the spider pit sequence is still missing.The score to the movie is excellent and the other stars which include Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot play excellent parts too. This movie is essential viewing, more so if you are a dinosaur movie fan like me. Great stuff!Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just The Way An Adventure Story Should Be Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic is still plenty of fun to watch. It may be 'only' an adventure story, but it's done just the way one should be, with good, effective buildup before the main action begins, lots of good detail in the sets and action, and use of special effects that is very effective for its time. The cast does a solid job, while allowing "Kong" to remain the star, and it has a musical score that generally sets off the action well. It all fits together very nicely, and it has held up very well over the years.It's also worth getting one of the video versions that now allow you to see some of the background of the movie as well as some of the techniques that were either improvised or significantly advanced in order to make "King Kong". Naturally there are a few times when the special effects now seem a bit creaky, but the more you know about how they did everything, the more you can appreciate their accomplishment and also the ways that later movies drew on these techniques. And all this aside, "King Kong" remains one of the most entertaining movies of its kind, despite its age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A historically and aesthetically important masterpiece (contains spoilers).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel compelled to add certain comments to those that have already been contributed here because it seems some people wonder why this film is considered so great. It has been said that the story is flimsy and time-worn, the acting wooden and the dialogue hokey. The 'Beauty and the Beast' storyline *is* time-worn, but this is only in terms of *contemporary films* that have gone over this ground so often since King Kong was released. Two reasons for this are firstly, that the theme of unrequited love is such a *classic* storyline that many people can identify with, and secondly, that King Kong itself, as a hugely popular film in its day (it single-handedly saved R.K.O. from bankruptcy during the height of the Great Depression), influenced the type of films that got made subsequently. To cite this as a criticism of King Kong is to judge the film without thought for its historical context; I remember the first time I saw the hitchhiking Claudette Colbert stop the truck by showing her leg in It Happened One Night and I groaned at this awful clich. Then it occurred to me that this could well have been the first time this gag was ever used on screen, and that for me to criticize the movie for *seeming* clichd fifty-odd years after it was first released, is grossly unfair. So it is with King Kong. Another thing that I think many modern movie-goers commonly overlook when critiquing King Kong, is that actors today are very conversant with the concept of acting/reacting 'to nothing', where the special visual effects will be added later, in post production. This was all very new in 1933; the special effects were practically revolutionary (as far as I know, only O'Brian's work in the little seen The Lost World had previously showcased the stop-motion animation technique in this way i.e. having 'realistic' monsters interacting with real characters - in fact, as I recall, The Lost World had no human characters in it at all). Furthermore, King Kong was never intended to be an 'actor's' film. It was made during the production line era of movie-making where films were made in weeks rather than the years that is typical today. It isn't uncommon to see fluffed lines or accidents in films made in this way and in this period - e.g. Groucho Marx getting hit on the head by a falling chair in the fracs towards the end of Duck Soup; as long as the shot served its purpose, it was considered in the can and the crew would hurry on to the next scene. Again, this is the result of the historical context in which the film was made, and to criticize King Kong for being made when it was, is nonsensical. The film is clearly a monster film and not a work of Shakespear; the actors are all expected to play second fiddle to the technical wizardry on show.Now to the wonders of King Kong. The attention to detail in O'Brian's animation is tremendous and well documented. There is so much more to the majesty of King Kong than this though. One scene I particularly admire is Kong's cave, with its very subtle pool of bubbling mud and rising steam. There is a marvelous depth to the shots that was entirely artificial, created using 'layers' of glass paintings and real foreground foliage. The sound effects are not often mentioned but they deserve to be; Kong's roar and chest beating thump is forever etched in my mind. Also the screams - King Kong is a horror film and I think the screams and shrieks of Kong's victims are remarkably (and perhaps unusually) realistic. Finally, (and I have saved the best for last) is the absolutely peerless shot composition. When we first see Kong as he pushes the trees apart, is fantastic beyond words - in fact, I would say this film has more 'must see' shots than any other film ever e.g. the reverse shot of Fay Wray as she struggles to escape her bonds and the breathtaking shot of Kong driving open the mighty doors before the fleeing natives. Another is the terrific idea of having Kong leave Anne helpless in the tree (not only for safekeeping but to prevent her escape) and then positing the camera (and thus the audience) *behind* her so that we are enabled to fully realise the perilous nature of her predicament, but in a way that illustrates that no one is around to help her. The director avoided to use of the point-of-view shot, making the viewer feel not only fear for Anne, but also helplessness; had POV shots been used, the audience would 'only' feel fear for Anne *and themselves* as one; as if they too were in the tree. I think the shot of Kong falling backwards into this tree is thus particularly stunning because it makes me feel as if I am right behind Anne and thus in danger myself (from the falling tree). In fact, this particular fight is a high point of the entire film. The wrestling and boxing tactics that Kong employs, quickly, yet subtly, humanize him in a way that makes us want him to win, particularly since Anne's life now depends on his victory (this is a key factor in the emotive power of the film's climax). The manoeuvre where Kong grabs the rex's leg and then does a somersault over it, is awesome! Who could possibly have expected it? This *illusion* of spontaneity makes it all the more possible to suspend one's disbelief - something that is essential with fantasy films. The animation is so cleverly executed that I for one find it easy to forget that all the Kong shots were photographed one frame at a time. Who can forget the tree bridge scene? Notice the superb illusion of weight to that tree when Kong 'apehandles' it. Who can't help but feel for the poor sailors on that log; some make more valiant efforts to hang on than others, but all are doomed nonetheless. Then there is the wonderful moment when the restraining cuff breaks at Kong's wrist; to me, this is one of the defining moments of the horror of the whole film. Again, the real world audience is cleverly drawn into the action: we are just an extension of the audience that is actually in Kong's presence. When it becomes clear that Kong is going to break loose, we too feel like it is time to head for the exit! What this must have felt like to those who first saw King Kong in an actual theatre, I can hardly imagine! Another such moment is the expression of the train driver when he realises that he's *not* seeing things - and boy, does Kong do a job on that train carriage. Yet another utterly striking shot is when Kong pulls the 'not Anne' woman from the warmth of her bed, out into the cold night air, hundreds of feet above the lights and crowds below; examines her momentarily and then just discards her to fall to her death. This is, in my opinion, one of the most enduring horror moments of cinema; accompanied by a superbly realistic scream that melds into the sound of sirens in a way reminiscent of Hitchcock's sound bridges. Finally, we come to the tragic ending scene which is again, incredibly memorable. I think it is because we all understand so clearly what we have seen - a mighty beast, a king in his own world, facing a foe he cannot comprehend or ever defeat - man and his technology. This is the power of the expression that Willis O'Brian painstakingly imbued into what was actually nothing more than an 18" model. Through these means he communicated to the audience Kong's emotions in a way that no man in a monkey suit ever could; the simple curiosity, the anger, the frustration, the triumph and pride; so that at the end, when we see his pitiful confusion at his wounds and his own blood, drawn in a way incomprehensible to him, we cannot but feel for him. To me, this is one of the great wonders of cinema; that it can be used to induce people to feel, in a profound way, for mere puppets.There is no question that King Kong is the grandaddy of monster films. One fun thing for movie fans to try to do is imagine being Steven Spielberg making Jurassic Park and deciding how best to introduce the T-rex, bearing in mind that the special effects are going to be seen in the same revolutionary light as King Kong's were in it's day, and that as a result, it will be compared to King Kong. Given the reference to it, it is certain that Spielberg was well aware of the special place that many people have in their hearts for this beloved movie.</fullReview>

He is King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World! Though I don't have particular fondness for stop motion animation, I thought visual effects are great. Essences of VFX for gigantic materials are perspective, points of view and contrast with smaller / nearer objects, and this film is filled with very clever examples of them.And this movie is cruel.You see, that huge ape is not responsible for disaster in New York. Totally not. He might be horrible tyrant in Skull Island, but he never hoped to visit big apple. All of tragedies of later part were basically done by human arrogance, and nobody feels sorry for poor Kong. But this selfish cruelty effected as an unexpected pathos, and made this movie a forever masterpiece. Never miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original and the best, the greatest monster movie ever conceived. The classic beauty and the best tale of the filmmaker who went to an uncharted island with a girl to film a new movie but brings back something alot bigger. Kong, the eighth wonder of the world, a 40 foot gorilla untouched by mankind. He vicously slaughters people but seems to have a kind, gentle side towards the girl, play by Fay Wray, who let out some of the first audible blood curdling screams in the history of film. Kong is brought to civilization and shown at NYC. Kong escapes from his chains and goes on a rampage. He kidnaps Wray and climbs the empire state building, where he swats at airplanes until, tragically, he loses his balance and falls to his death. An incredible film. The seqences are very interesting shot and framed. The stop motion animation by Willis O'Brien is very fluent and downright outstandiung for it's time, this would be what would convince Ray Harryhausen to become a special effects man. King Kong is an odd character, he is much like Frankenstien, he only did bad things because he was misunderstood and wanted love and his normal lifestyle was interrupted. King Kong would go on to be in hundreds more films but they all can't compare with this one. I would reccommend this to anyone even remotely interested in film making. This is especially a must see for horror and sci-fi fans. My rating: ***** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Retelling of "Beauty &amp; The Beast" Fable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A grand fantasy-adventure-romance tale. What makes this 1933 film such an enduring classic is it's underlying theme's dramatic rendering: King Kong is essentially a love story, propelled by adventure. Outstanding visual effects by Willis O'Brien and crew: they created 18" creature models called "armatures" which were magically brought to life by Willis' stop-motion photography and rear-projection techniques(Kong's armature-frame was made from an aluminum alloy; his muscles from rubber and sponge, which were then covered by rabbit's fur); while close-ups of Kong's chewing and stomping were performed by hidden men operating a massive Kong head &amp; shoulders bust, along with a giant handand foot; "Skull Mountain" and other large stationary objects were made in miniature, or painted on glass and matted into a larger frame. The visual effects were enhanced by Murray Spivak's ingenious sound effects: the creature's roars, screeches, howls, etc., were made by recording actual animal sounds and playing them backwards. For instance, Kong's roars were actually lions roars, lowered one octave, then played backwards. Next added was Max Steiner's superb original musical score - one of the first to be written solely for a film - which he syncronized to the action to great effect. These marvelous technical achievements, when integrated with Cooper's &amp; Shoedsack's quick-paced direction; Creelman's and Rose's taut screenplay; and the adequate acting of Wray, Armstrong and Cabot, created quite a memorable film indeed. No wonder it has thrilled so many for so many years: "Oh, no. It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant monster film contains an equally brilliant parody of the movie industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think most of the reviewers here have been missing a very important point - that King Kong was, among other things, a hilarious and biting parody of the movie industry. If anything, the monster movie aspect of the film may have been done too well since it tends to hide this other intention. When director Carl Denham complains about having to satisfy his critics by including a love interest, he is echoing the exact sentiments of the actual directors of the movie. And so Ann Darrow ends up serving as the love interest for both Carl Denham and for Cooper &amp; Schoedsack! Denham films her on board screaming at an unseen menace. "What does he think she will really see?" says Driscoll. Actually, the actress will see nothing - the menace is added later using special effects. The movie is full of little tweaks like this if you are prepared to watch for them, and the entire film is a somewhat caustic comment on the entire modern entertainment industry, as it existed then and still does today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie! I'm not discrediting its merit as a classic, but I have to say that I am shocked that a movie this incredibly sexist is so beloved in the hearts of film buffs. It was dripping with misogyny within the first ten minutes, the male characters insulted women as often as they could, yet were so arrogantly entitled to them?? It was bizarre. The men are rude and ignorant of common decency, and the one female character is oblivious, with her head in the clouds the whole time. The men are so transparent but she never catches on. The grossest exchange was when a man said, "I love you" to a woman, and she replies, flattered and giddy, "but you hate women!!" to which he so eloquently says, "well you're not women." ? That made me angry. It was like this nasty romanticism of misogyny. "I hate women but I love you, a woman" is not cute, or sweet, or romantic.I could go on but I don't want to get worked up. I just can't get over how unlikeable everyone was. The one female was just a stupid, damsel in distress, plot device, and all the men were pushy white guys who think they can do whatever they want. They were so unbelievably arrogant, like they were all right all the time, knew everything about everything. Deceitful, exploitative, greedy egomaniacs. And there was no character development whatsoever. No one was accountable for their actions, no one learned anything, no one improved and no one became more evil. No change. The character is the same from their first scene to their last. With one enormous exception. There were things that I did enjoy, don't worry. The story is still exciting despite the pieces of garbage humans in it. Absolutely legendary special effects. The first time we see Kong on screen gave me goosebumps! It was awesome. Try to imagine yourself in the theater in 1933 seeing this stuff, utterly amazed (in between giggles). The special effects blew them away back then but they are wildly adorable now. The special effects aren't perfect obviously, but they're still very impressive for their time and the way that they did it no doubt took so, so, so much work and planning to become the final product. Awesome, awesome creative shots. The planning, the animating, getting these actors to act with something that wasn't there, a tremendous endeavor. The screaming is hilarious, man, it had me cackling. Kong was cute as hell and I love him. The sets are colossal! Awesome hair and make-up. The final scene is legendary and worth the viewing for sure. It is truly a masterpiece on its own- the editing, the sound, the POV shots of the airplanes, so incredible.Overall, it was just too frustrating to enjoy. Awful characters doing awful things? Not fun. Greed and misogyny? Not fun. Exploitation of women and wildlife for financial gain? Not fun. It was fascinating and exciting, but its cons outweighed its pros, in my opinion. I doubt I'll watch again. 6/10Bye love you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outstanding, absolutely Outstanding. This is the true classic KING KONG! It's so obvious observing this film that this is really the dawn of special effects. This film is what truly started making the impossible, possible. Also the film has great photography, good lighting and very convincing acting. Some of the shots in the film were also very interestingly composed. This is actually the King Kong to see, the newer remakes are not nearly as good as this one. The special effects are really what make this movie though, they look somewhat corny now, but I think because of this film alone, the idea of combining effects with shot by shot film is really just a sheer progression for the movie industry. This film comes highly recommended by me. 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It hard for me to say anything about this movie that hasn't been said 1,000,000,000 times, but I'm going to give it a shot. First of all lets talk about the storyline, it is f**king brilliant. Carl Denham wants to make a movie, and ends up on Skull Island home to Dinosaurs, Giant beasts, and of course KING FREAKIN KONG! The effects are out standing for there time. In my opinion they still look awesome today! I would have to say that the only problem with the movie is the fact, that some of the acting is a little corny. (Especially the Caral Denham guy) But that is just nit picking and it dose not come close to ruining a great movie. I say see it if your a monster movie fan like myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows the film King Kong, whether it's the 1930's 1970's or even the new 2005 film, anyone can say they have seen or heard of King Kong.The 1930's King Kong is mainly the more famous and talked about one, since it was of course the first. Now during the 1930's films were still in Black &amp; White, and the editing to films aren't as spectacular as we see today. This down side to the film may have people saying "Wow that was so corny" but editing to films isn't what makes films memorable and famous.What made King Kong famous was the story line and acting. If you think about it, no part of the story line was changed in any of the remakes of the movie, possibly because if you were to change it it wouldn't be as good or well flowing.King Kong was so magnificent and well made. The acting to this film made it what it is. Ann Darrow who played Fay Wray, showed such amazing and fear, and her scream was done so well, it must be famous! This movie was downright amazing, and for those who love old fashioned films, King Kong is a must see for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the 2005 King Kong remake, I figured it be fun to watch the original. I loved it! For being made in the 1930's and with the less advanced technology than we have now, I felt that King Kong looked great! Fay Wray was very good in her role as Ann Darrow, especially the first time she sees Kong after being left as a sacrifice for him. I felt that through her screams that she was absolutely terrified of Kong. The music and the fog enhanced the suspense and terror that was happening during the suspenseful scenes, especially while they were still on the island. King Kong also had some pretty good fight scenes as well. But seeing the later remakes when I sat down to watch the original I knew how it was going end. But overall, I loved it just like the other King Kong movies I had seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 76 years and 3 remakes this movie is still my favorite of the King Kong films. I enjoyed Peter Jackson's remake (not so much the 70's one), but this one has the advantage of being the original, plus having loads of charm contained within the brilliant special effects of Willis H. O'Brien. The plot is universally known, so to explain it here would simply be redundant. The pacing of the movie is tighter than Jackson's film as well, and the acting is of the appropriate nature for a film of this type. King Kong spawned a whole genre of imitators, some of which I enjoy better than Kong itself, however none of them can claim the classic status of this film. Highly recommended to any fan of adventure films or fantasy films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"King Kong", although more than 75 years old, continues to captivate movie audiences. In addition to being a pioneering special effects film it is also a top-notch thriller.The cinematic ingenuity that brought Kong to the screen all those years ago makes this a worthwhile film even today. The stop-motion animation of Willis O'Brien brings Kong and the other denizens of Skull Island to vivid life. There's also a plethora of innovative camera trickery allowing the interaction of actors with the animated creatures. Mere description doesn't do this work justice; it must be seen for itself.Another highly regarded aspect of "King Kong" is the score. In fact, it was ranked as the 13th best film score in American cinema by the AFI. I would certainly say that it plays an essential part in establishing the early mood of the film and in driving the film's relentless pace once Kong is introduced.The acting may not be anything to write home about but that's alright. After all, what do you expect from a film about a giant ape? Fay Wray gets most of the attention and deservedly so. She didn't have to do much more than scream and look beautiful but she excels on both counts.Simply put, this is a must-see film for any self-respecting film fan. Although the special effects are a far cry from today's best efforts it is nevertheless amazing to see the pioneering work on display here. Besides that, it's just a damn entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In retrospect, it can be seen that "King Kong" (1933) was probably the first special effects driven movie. I mean, without King Kong's great special effects what would be there to remember? Certinaly not the acting. Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong, and Bruce Cabot give such wooden performances that its quite surprising to find out that they have three dimensions, and are not just card-board cut outs. The plot is nothing imaginative ether, with a film crew going to "Skull Island" (it must have taken a while for the script writers to think up that name) and after discovering King Kong, they capture him, and then bring him to New York. So, Willis O'Brien and his team of crack technicians got down to work and created some of the eras most mind-blowing effects (and are still pretty mind-blowing nowadays as well). A very enjoyable film that anyone can like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic, a true groundbreaking adventure for it's time, and the first real blockbuster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Struggling filmmaker Carl Denham takes his crew across the sea to Skull island, where they find more than they bargained for, especially up and coming actress Ann Darrow. On Skull Island they find a land lost in time, on this land the dinosaurs roam, as well as a large bloodthirsty ape seeking for a bride to be.King Kong came from a dream that co-director, producer, and writer Merian C. Cooper had one night, the type of nightmare that inspired something frightening and visually fantastic, an ape taking on the big apple. Not only that but after seeing Komodo dragons locked away in cages the thought of this wild caged animal locked up was an epic thought. Many things inspired Kong and collaborating these experiences turned a Saturday matine into a classic that dazzled audiences worldwide.King Kong was a groundbreaking visual experience for it's time and is looked by movie makers as an epic that will never cease to amaze and to entertain. Even though King Kong 1933 is dated with it's effects it still is incredible solid by today's standards.King Kong in itself created a new genre, the Hollywood blockbuster that strived to entertain the world and take them to new heights with pushing the limits of special effects and at the same time have catchy storyline filled with characters that could keep the plot moving. Not to mention have the audiences eat more popcorn during the show.Unlike the other remakes this Kong seen in this version is no lovable ape, he's vicious and deadly and has no remorse, except with his affection, being Ann.One has to imagine what the world would've been like if King Kong never was made, what would have inspired such filmmakers to seek inspiration and the encouragement to say "We can do this"? Witout Kong one has to imagine if Godzilla would've been made, or any of the other famous Japanese monsters. What would Star Wars had been like without King Kong? The Lord of the Rings? Kubrick's 2001? Steven Spielberg's Jaws, Close Encopunters, Jurassic Park? Independence Day? And for more modern day fares, Transformers, The Incredible Hulk, and Iron Man? Though I think the real question wouldn't go for Kong but more for it's inspiration The Lost World, what would the movie world be like without Kong? When I was younger me and father always used to watch King Kong late on Firday nights after we returned from the local high school football game. King Kong left this impact on me as a movie goer, and got me into older films much more.I would highly recommend this title, it is a fantastic experience to enjoy.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, when I first picked up this movie, I was only really meaning to watch it out of historical curiosity, not really thinking I would enjoy it much. I was so ridiculously wrong!!! It's fun, entertaining, fast paced, gorgeous visually, and Kong's face is the most expressive I've ever seen created in such a movie. You really feel emotions coming from him. The plot is pretty well known; I'd already heard the ending from other people long before I watched the movie for the first time. I don't think I really have to go into it; you've probably heard to much of the plot yourself already. Watch it, really, is all I can say. The characters are fascinating (Fay Wray is absolutely gorgeous, by the way), and you will want to watch it a second time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and I couldn't wait to see it again after that first time in the early 60s when I saw it at a friend's house who had cable TV.not surprising the whole story itself was inspired by a nightmare of one of the executives involved.this movie earns top marks in numerous categories: story line, top B&amp;W classic film feature and those special effects that if you engage in the Shakespearean 'willing suspension of disbelief' will scare the daylights out of you. it is also in that rare breed that inspired TWO remakes. the Jackson version also is superb because this one provides the necessary foundation.a very tight hour and 40 minutes of terror and excitement. with lessons and morals thrown in. the press corps that disregards the danger they cause with the flood of flashbulbs, intent of 'getting the story' to the point they BECOME part of the story. and THAT is happening all the time now. and the line Carl Denholm gives about the 'chrome steel': nothing to worry about, yada yada ya. like the unsinkable Titanic not a worry in the world. oops !! it even has a very humorous line from the audience scene near the end; 'it's some kind of big gorilla', 'don't we have enough of those in New York' as the clumsy galoot steps all over the woman's feet getting to his seat. priceless.Fay Wray was a real hottie in any era.this is NOT a film for the modern spoiled attention deficit brat demanding to be entertained but utterly uninterested in doing their part. you have to see this version of King Kong at least once. it is readily available and well worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is an amazing movie. In my opinion it is the greatest movie along with The Empire Strikes Back and Jaws.I don't feel I need to recap the main points of the movie. Most people understand what goes on.King Kong is the first major giant monster film. King Kong is spectacularly done stop motion wise. Kong looks great for the time he was made. He really looks real and there really are no parts where he looks fake at all.Also well done are the dinosaurs in this film. This also could be one of the best dinosaur films ever if you consider this a dinosaur film as well as a monster film. Stegosaurus and Brontosaurus both look like they are supposed to and this film was made back in the thirties so the scientific accuracy on how they look is good. Not so scientifically accurate is how the Brontosaurus chases down men and eats some of them since Brontosaurus was a plant eater. But I like that part, it takes you back to when Dinosaur films did not need to be accurate and they just wanted to have fun. THe Brontosaurus in this film is one of the best dinosaurs in movie history.Tyrannosaurus, or Allosaurus, also shows up for one of the best scenes in movie history. The fight he gets in with Kong is amazing. Really well done and easily the best scene in the film. That fight is one that you will never see again and you really have to appreciate these films more since none will be made like this again.Unlike the remakes, Kong in this film is terrifying and remorseless. In the remakes they tried to portray him as a sympathetic figure but in this one he is just scary and goes after anyone who gets in his way. This is the best way to portray him I think because it will make you less sad if things go bad for him.The acting is pretty good, but it is more of the movie having such a good story that average acting would be OK. I think Fay Wray really is not that great of an actress and she seems to just scream the whole movie.The effects for its time is great, has a great story, and is one of the best films ever. If you have never seen this film you should be embarrassed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original King Kong is one of the few "classic" movies that does live up to it's hype. First off let me start by saying that the Special Effects still hold up well today, so I could only imagine how in awe people must have been at them back in 1933. King Kong also manages to do what few movies do - and that is it manages to never have a single dull moment in it's entire 104 minute length. Unlike the Jackson remake, this one moves at a brisk pace, never leaving you with a single moment of boredom. The performances are all solid, though some of it can be a bit hammy, but that's more of a product of the times than anything else. I can tell you that the Kong Vs T-Rex fight is far more realistic in this one than the Jackson version. I for one wasn't buying Kong defeating three T-Rex's at once, while falling at the same time. This one shows Kong having a tough time defeating the T-Rex, but of-course ultimately defeating him after a lengthy but entertaining fight. I also liked the relationship between the girl and Kong better in the 33 version as it didn't feel as sappy or as contrived as Jackson remakes did. Anyway, I give this movie a 10/10, and it falls somewhere in my top ten horror movies. Of the three King Kong Movies made, this one is by far the best, with Jackson's remake coming in a distant second, and the 1976 remake in dead last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny the things you remember - or, perhaps, the things you don't remember. Having just watched this movie, I find myself wondering if I've ever actually seen it before. Obviously I've seen snippets, but so much seemed so wonderfully unfamiliar that I'm just not sure if it's only the snippets I've seen. Two things stood out in my memory as I sat down to watch this - Fay Wray screaming (which she does - a lot!) and the giant ape climbing the Empire State Building and being attacked by airplanes. But there's so much more that those memories blocked out.First, while Fay Wray does scream a lot, she also puts on a fantastic performance as Ann Darrow, the beautiful young blonde (and she is extremely beautiful, and, by the standards of 1933 her wardrobe is quite - shall we say - suggestive at times - one can sympathize with Kong for falling for her) who finds herself accompanying movie maker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) on a voyage in search of - well, something to make a movie about. He found something! The Empire State Building scene is so ingrained in my memory that it came as a shock to realize that so much of this movie (probably three quarters of it) is set not in New York City but on this mysterious island where Kong is discovered.When I think of 1930's horror movies, I usually think of the Universal Pictures collection (Dracula, Frankenstein, etc.) King Kong was Radio Pictures entry into the genre, and this is every bit the equal of (and possibly better than) any of the Univeral pictures. Universal focused on atmosphere over adventure or fright, and they did that very well. King Kong blends it all together. It has great atmosphere, particularly on the island, but it's also a non-stop adventure, and it's very frightening at times - often graphically so, as the ship's crew does battle against the assorted creatures they discover on the island (including, but not limited to, Kong.) I struggle - and fail - to find anything in the actual body of the movie to criticize. It was the kind of movie I could have sat down with and watched again right away. The only thing that detracted from it was the opening musical overture - a sort of Wagnerian sounding piece that went on and on for close to five minutes with nothing but the word "OVERTURE" on the screen. After the first two or three minutes I started to think something was wrong with the DVD, and I almost turned it off. I'm glad I didn't. This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. 9/10 (losing a point only for the Wagnerian opening.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong starts in a New York harbour where a film director named Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) is preparing to set sail on a voyage to a mysterious uncharted island where he intends to make his next picture. But first he must find a leading lady as his usual agent Charles Weston (Sam Hardy) refuses to supply anyone because of the dangerous nature of the expedition, while scouring the streets of New York he finds an attractive blonde named Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) whom accepts the job. With Denham, Ann &amp; his crew aboard Captain Englehorn (Frank Reicher) sets sail for Skull Island, while at sea a blossoming relationship between Ann &amp; second in command John Driscoll (Bruce Cabot) begins to develop. Once on Skull island they meet the natives who want Ann as an offering to a 50 odd foot gorilla named Kong. That night some natives sneak aboard &amp; kidnap Ann, take her back to Skull Island &amp; chain her to a couple of posts. Meanwhile a rescue party has already been formed &amp; are on Skull Island with the intention of getting Ann back safely. Kong appears, grabs Ann and disappears into the jungle hotly followed by the rescue party who must face prehistoric monsters in an attempt to save Ann...Directed by Merian C. Cooper &amp; Ernest B. Schoedsack King Kong was apparently the film that saved RKO from bankruptcy &amp; at the time had the biggest opening of any film to that date with $900,000 &amp; can probably be regarded as one of the finest monster films ever made. The script by James Ashmore Creelman &amp; Ruth Rose is a little slow to get going but it's all relevant stuff like solid characterisation &amp; scene setting that still entertains &amp; is necessary, although I wasn't convinced by Driscoll &amp; Darrow's falling in love. However once King Kong reaches Skull Island then it's non stop right through to it's climax in New York. It's one dinosaur fight after another, from a Brontosaurus &amp; Stegasaurus to a T-Rex &amp; Pterandon. Then it's off to New York for it's famous climax atop the Empire State Building. On a basic level the story is one of beauty &amp; the beast, the film manages to make Kong a character himself &amp; you end up feeling for him. Surprisingly King Kong, considering the time it was made, is quite a dark film with Kong taking Darrow's clothes off, violent dinosaur fights, people being bitten &amp; thrown around, Kong deliberately trampling people underfoot, people falling to their deaths, &amp; a scene where he throws a woman off the Empire State Building because she isn't Ann.Director's Cooper &amp; Schoedsack do a pretty good job &amp; King Kong has a nice feel throughout. The special effects are what may put some people off, the stop motion animation is often jerky &amp; not really the best ever seen but it has that certain charm, personality &amp; after a while when you become used to it they don't distract &amp; they were probably as good as could have been achieved back in the early 30's, I especially like the way Cooper &amp; Schoedsack try to mix the footage of human's &amp; stop motion together wherever possible. The character's take a back seat for most of the film &amp; the acting ain't that good anyway.With a supposed budget of about $670,000 King Kong holds up well today although I'm sure there are plenty of people who would laugh at the effects, not want to watch it purely because it's filmed in black and white &amp; that it's old, but it would be their loss. According to the IMDb King Kong was filmed between 10th October 1931 &amp; 1st Febuary 1933 which I find very, very hard to believe (the IMDb also list's the initial premiere during 'late Jaunuary 1933'!?) but if it's true then a lot of effort went into making it. It shows. The jungle scenes were filmed on the same set as used in The Most Dangerous Game (1932) while the huge gate on Skull Island was originally made for a film called Intolerance: Love's Struggle Through the Ages (1916).King Kong has a timeless story that still works well even today, some cool monsters &amp; action scenes &amp; has been remade twice once in 1976 &amp; more recently Peter Jackson's mega budget 2005 remake currently raking the money in at your local cinema. As it stands the original Kong is still well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hail to the King, baby! ...The one and only!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hurry hurry; let's quickly watch the original King Kong again before we run off to see Peter Jackson's much hyped and multi-budgeted hi-tech remake! Thank you very much, guys from the BBC, for once more programming this purely genius cinema-milestone that still hasn't lost any of its power to impress, thrill or even sadden. "King Kong" is over 70 years old now, but still an astonishing experience with groundbreaking visual effects and innovating ways of scripting that would influence the future of cinema a great deal. The story opens somewhat banal, with Robert Armstrong as the shifty showman recruiting a bunch of macho seamen and one stunningly beautiful actress to sail out for a supposedly big project. The island where they arrive is very secluded and homed by a primitive tribe and prehistoric animals. But the most notable inhabitant is a humongous and bad-tempered gorilla that seems to rule over anything on the island. Expedition leader Denham hopes to benumb the animal and take it back to New York to exhibit, and that even seems possible since King Kong's romantic interest in the actress makes him vulnerable. King Kong is more than just a magnificent piece of animation techniques?He's portrayed as a fully-fledged character that you're meant to care (or even cheer) for. He's not exactly a cute little monkey but nevertheless he has honest emotions and protects what he loves. Simply because of this unique character development, however, "King Kong" becomes a hugely moving story and the classic finale is downright saddening, in my opinion. Who cares if he kills so many people?the ape has feelings! Nothing but great respect for O'Brien immortal stop-motion animation work and also Max Steiner's subtly atmospheric music contributes in making "King Kong" one of the absolute greatest movies ever. The extended battle-sequences between the giant ape and multiple types of dinosaurs definitely still rank amongst the most perplexing images in horror/adventure cinema ever. Also, and especially with all the additional footage of re-releases, this is a rather cruel film with a tremendous body count and some very efficient shock moments. Perfect piece of nostalgic cinema from every way you look at it.</fullReview>

The original uses sharp story-telling and precision film-making to achieve a great result, with the whole story wrapped up before Jackson has even managed to get off Skull Island. The original version is Savile Row quality, the new version is K Mart. For enduring satisfaction, I recommend Savile Row every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While King Kong has dated a lot in 70 years (certainly a lot of the drama has faded into self-parody), I can't help but be amazed by the level of focus on Kong himself.Kong represents the futile hero whose ending everyone already knows by now. There is no difference between him, Braveheart, Gladiator, or The Wild Bunch. His existence is simply one of brutality (I guess Mike Tyson did have a competitor for style back in the 30s) and the more we see him, the less we like him (again with the Mike Tyson comment).The film itself uses both primitive and advanced techniques for its day. There is almost zero camera movement except the POV shots from the biplanes at the end (delivered in the shaky, "you are there" fashion), but I found it interesting how the shot composition always tried to exert some kind of mood. 30s movies always tried to do this, whether Little Caeser, The Public Enemy, or Gone with the Wind. The music is the typical lackluster 30s poof, but Kong's theme was pompous enough to remind me of Conan the Barbarian. The characters are a load of hooey and much of the dialog is garbage we've been hearing for decades, but that's not the charm of the movie.I was also surprised at how non-politcally-correct this movie is by modern standards--I like it already! How many films today would have a giant ape dropping a woman 20 stories to the ground in cold blood? Not only did the '76 remake not understand a lot of these principles, namely insulting the better instincts of the audience in exchange for storytelling skill, but it tried to top everything by showing less. King Kong movies are supposed to be grandiose, restricting them only limits the scope.Overall, violence against animals has only gotten more mind-numbing since this movie (Starship Troopers, Jurassic Park, etc.), but Kong still shows he is the King! My kudos to Willis O'Brien for slaving to make something memorable. He did. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the Child in All of Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong is the reason film exists as a format. It is not one of the best films ever made and might not even be objectively considered a great film. But it is one of the most important ones ever made for more reasons that I can list here. I will keep this succinct and simple.Until King Kong, film had been, in great part, a continuation of the theater and classical literature. Bar the epic printed dreams of pioneers such as Melies, Lang and Murnau, it had strived to show us what is or was, but had never dared to completely break with reality. With the great Kong, cinema completely broke with convention and language, and offered sights and experiences that no other format could allow, rising head and shoulders above the technical standards of the time. It offered the best known mythical image in cinema to live in the collective subconscious: a giant ape standing defiantly atop the world's tallest building, clutching his tiny beloved while fighter planes rain bullets down on him.It all comes down to that moment, and to the new understanding that movies could not just entertain, they could thrill! The central story is a clumsy take on a narrative archetype, and the effects are more touching than awe-inspiring today. The main reason modern attempts to revamp this old chestnut (notably by Peter Jackson to uncertain effect) have mostly failed is because you do not remake the Mona Lisa of cinema. It was a one-off, and is arguably not that great to begin with, but it has become us and lives within us forever.It marks the moment films started speaking not just to our minds, eyes and ears, but to our imagination. To the child that lives in all of us. That child was finally given the perfect playmate: that big, lovable, clumsy, hairy toddler known as King Kong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the monster movies I've seen, and I'm talking Jaws, Jurassic Park, KK remakes, The Thing etc, none of them hold a candle to the Grand Daddy of all movie monsters.I saw the censored version way back in my early teens. It was shown on the BBC over the Halloween period. We watched it late at night with the lights off (as a dare). Being fairly streetwise punks we all felt pretty cool about seeing some badly dated old movie with ancient effects (we saw this pre-Star Wars!)After a fairly casual 30 minutes into the film we see Little Faye being tied up to those giant pillars in the dense jungle with the grim beat of the drums only adding to the feeling that this girl is in big trouble.And then the great Ape appears, and although he didn't look all that scary initially, it's what he did to the native village and the ensuing rampage through the jungle that really scared the Hell out of all of us.The stop-motion animation by Mel Berns may look clumsy to our computer CGI sanitised eyes, but it still holds a certain power that CGI just doesn't have. Jurassic Park is a good film but the monsters "look" just too perfect, too "clean &amp; bright".King Kong &amp; the other creatures that roamed his particular domain were all the more terrifying because they looked more natural &amp; had certain traits &amp; mannerisms JP just totally lacks.Ok the Beauty &amp; the Beast storyline is a little creeky and the acting is more wooden than the jungle itself. But I think the movie deserves its "classic" status for being a genuinely thought-provoking, cum, terrifying movie.Don't forget, back in the early 30s there was no TV, no computers, no great proliferation of sfx from other movies. And on top of this there was a great depression on. We're talking unsophisticated audiences as far as movie mania goes, so we shouldn't be too harsh on the production values in the film.And is essence the film isn't really about Kong's rampage, its more to do with Man's greed &amp; messing around with nature (70 years on and we still haven't learnt). And that's why I found it profoundly sad that KK should die so cheaply at the hands of Man and his machines of destruction (just like the shark in Jaws).Even though I've now seen the uncut movie many times and it still thrills me even now, I will never forget that first viewing on Halloween Night when 4 streetwise teen guys ended up gibbering wrecks with graphic nightmares to follow us around for weeks &amp; months to come!*****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It endures time and criticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great tributes to the power of KING KONG is that it has attracted innumerable allegorical and deconstructionist theories, yet in the end it defies all of them. The film is so powerful a tale, such a primal journey into story archetypes, that people automatically reflect their own personality onto it.The theories are almost endless: a racist tale of the Black man in American, a parable of America seeking an escape from the depression, a Freudian story of where the Empire State building is a phallic symbol and Denham uses Kong as his sexual release for his lust for Anne (I've always found this theory to be hysterically funny), and a tale of ecology and man's continual destruction of nature. KING KONG is, after all, a work of art, so any of these theories can be argued. But they tend to reduce a film that is far more complicated and powerful than a simple allegory. All these theories people develop to explain the movie cannot finally contain it -- KING KONG is a timeless phenomenon of the richness of great storytelling.What truly makes the film work, for audiences in 1933 and today, is that it is a masterpiece of escapist fantasy and adventure that fulfills our wildest daydreams of far off tropical lands and the gleaming metropolis of 1930s New York, the two great jungles of fantasy. Even today its relentless pace rockets viewers along. Once Denham's expedition arrives on Skull Island, the movie NEVER lets up with thrill after thrill after thrill. The effects look great, no excuses given -- they are a pure joy to watch. Cooper once said that he wanted to make the best adventure film of all time, and that was his only intention. Well Cooper, I think you damn near succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A monster movie, but with a lot of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of King Kong is a classic, it may be a monster movie but it has something that most of the other versions of the story don't have- heart. The story is basically a take on the timeless story of Beauty and the Beast but it is a powerful, beautiful, tragic and beguiling one. The cinematography is beautiful and crisp, and the scenery is convincing enough, plus the score is a gem. In terms of acting, Faye Wray is stunning as Ann Darrow and Robert Armstrong does well with a role that is admittedly on the corny side but hey I can live with that. But what made the film was King Kong himself, he is absolutely amazing to look at, he looks and acts very convincingly. Maybe scary to start with but as the film progresses (like the Beast in the fairytale Beauty and the Beast) you feel for him. The climax on top of the Empire State Building is one of cinema's greatest climaxes, and this is the only film version of King Kong where I had to stop the video to go and sort myself out from crying at the end. Overall, a beautiful timeless film. As said already, while essentially a monster movie, it is that with a lot of heart. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I've noticed a pattern forming in my reviews, where I complain that a classic film's reputation bears no relation to its worth. The Exorcist, Planet of the Apes, Singin' in the Rain - to me, these are at best only good movies, and at worst suffocating bores. It's frustrating to make the same point time and time again, but unfortunately, I can't break the routine for King Kong. It is not a masterpiece, it is not flawless, and it is not one of the greatest movies the world has ever seen, but beyond its reputation and the disappointment it brings, it's an enjoyable, scary and occasionally great film.The set-up is flawed by its laziness and is painfully contrived. Film-maker Carl Denham goes looking for the star of his new movie the night before setting sail to its location, and luckily finds a beautiful young actress in a caf. After a quick feed and a bunch of compliments she's on the boat and they're off to an unknown island. To be fair, there is a scene that explains that every actress in town has been warned off the picture because of its potential danger, but to find a leading lady just by wandering the streets smacks of desperation on the part of the writers.Once aboard, we are witness to an unconvincing and vaguely unsettling love story. The young actress, played by Fay Wray, falls for the first mate, not discouraged by his constant insults and apparent phobia of women. Again, this is clunky and badly executed, and only seems to be there at all because it'll come in handy later in the movie.With the poor set-up out of the way, the film begins to hit its stride. As we near the island there is a genuine sense of fear at the unknown, and it was a wise decision to not show Kong for the first half of the movie. It adds to the suspense and the build-up, and must have been particularly effective when first shown. Little Stevie Spielberg was paying attention, as he used the trick in Jaws and again in Jurassic Park to great effect, the big cheater!After a failed attempt to make nice with the island's inhabitants, Wray is kidnapped and offered to Kong as a sacrifice, setting the rest of the crew on a rescue mission. The sense of mystery as they enter the jungle is great, and this scene brings the first classic moments, but there is a terrible under-reaction to a stegosaurus that almost undermines the whole thing. Admittedly, these guys have witnessed some strange stuff on the island already, but finding a prehistoric creature deserves better than `Say, look at that!'This pattern of great-bit/crap-bit stays throughout the film and becomes increasingly frustrating. There is a terrific moment where Kong tries to kill his pursuers, tipping them off a log bridge and letting them fall to their deaths. A particularly tense moment comes when one of the crew hides in a small cave and Kong tries to grab him, and this is followed by a great battle between Kong and another of the island's huge creatures. But then the cack sets in, as the same scene is repeated over and over again; Kong gets jumped by a monster, Kong puts Wray down, Kong fights monster, Kong wins, Kong picks up Wray and carries on walking, Kong gets jumped... It undermines the first such scene, and shows that there is very little that can happen between the kidnap and rescue.Luckily, the film moves on by reversing the situation as Kong is defeated then taken back to America to be put on show, but logic takes a bathroom break again as it takes only one gas bomb to take him down, while the steg took three. Inevitably, Kong breaks free and goes on a rampage through the city in search of Wray, and again the movie gets its arse in gear. His attack on the train is stunning, as is the moment when he plucks a woman out of her apartment, then drops her carelessly to the ground as he realises she is not the woman he wants. There is a nice similarity, too, between Kong's curiosity in the city, and man's curiosity in the jungle. The ending is surprisingly sad, and our sympathy is with Kong rather than the people he's accidentally terrorising, but even here there's pap to be found; for the hundredth time we're given a line about beauty and the beast. We get the point, thanks, you can shut up now.So that's King Kong. It has great moments that deserve to be remembered, it has lapses of logic that are increasingly frustrating, and it has poor set-up and a number of repetitive moments. How people can see past those problems is beyond me, but if they want to call it flawless they can go right ahead. For me, it's just a good movie with great moments that I'll probably watch a couple more times before I die. That's not a great recommendation, is it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An eccentric film producer leads an expedition to a remote Pacific island where, according to legend, a great monster named Kong holds sway. The 'angle' which Carl Denham wishes to exploit is a reworking of the Beauty and the Beast myth, so he recruits a down-and-out girl from the streets of New York to be his Beauty. When the adventurers reach the island, they come face to face with Kong, the mighty ape ... Merian Cooper was the idiosyncratic producer-explorer who thought up the Kong idea and persuaded RKO ('Radio Pictures', as the studio refers to itself in the credits) to back the scheme. The Carl Denham character is a lightly-fictionalised representation of Cooper himself, an energetic gentleman adventurer with a flair for the movies and an obsession with Kong. For RKO, the smallest of the five major studios, bankrolling a project like this (the film cost $500,000) was a colossal gamble which paid off handsomely, but along the way the studio took steps to minimise its risk. A 'parallel' jungle flick was shot at night, utilising the Kong sets and also starring Fay Wray, this time with her natural dark colouring. The great gate in the island wall was used in several subsequent films over the ensuing six years, finally going up in flames in the burning of Atlanta in Selznick's "Gone With The Wind". It is impossible to offer an opinion on "King Kong" without mentioning the splendid special effects. A huge head-and-shoulders model of the ape was built and installed on a flat-bed truck. This device can be seen (for example) in the sequence where Kong pulls away Anne Darrow's clothing. A great hand was also constructed, and used in the scenes where Kong is reaching into apartment rooms in New York. However, the great glory of the film is Willis O'Brien's ingenious stop-motion animation. As if by magic, an 18-inch model covered in rabbit fur becomes for us a 50-foot monster which moves, breathes, thinks and feels. The interface of live action and animation is breath-taking - most notably in the scene where Kong shakes the sailors from the fallen tree trunk. Rear projection, enabling the actors to watch and react to film of the ape, was pioneered in this production. As sailors are plucked from their tree refuges, they recoil from Kong's looming face in a natural and believable way. Not only are the animation and the human actors co-ordinated beautifully - the sound effects and incidental music are superb, and superbly matched with the action. The point is perfectly illustrated by Kong's fight with the salamander in the cave. Max Steiner composed the powerful score, and his friend Maurice Spivack created the sound effects. The roars of dinosaurs and of Kong himself are recordings of lions and tigers played backwards, and Kong's little grunts of affection towards Anne are actually samples of Spivack's own voice, artificially slowed. The film contains some visual delights. As Anne is led to the altar on the island, the camera recedes in a marvellous crane shot. The stop-motion animation is stunning, particularly in the fight with the dinosaur (watch for Kong's curiosity over the broken jaw) and the struggle with the tyrannosaurus rex. The jungle sets are marvellous. Kong's grapple with the New York el-train is a definite highlight. It is little short of miraculous that O'Brien was able to create such a distinct personality for Kong (the expression 'King Kong' is never used in the film, being thought up by David Selznick only a short time before general release). We see the great ape imperious in his island fastness, dignified and Christ-like in captivity, shackled in crucifix pose, and loving and altruistic towards Anne. Sensational though the movie is, it does contain a few lapses of judgment. Jack Driscoll, the sailor hero who loves Anne, is played with wooden density by Bruce Cabot. Unaccountably, when Kong breaks out of the theatre, it is Jack who suggests to the authorities that fighter aircraft will be needed. Again, it is Jack rather than the rescue services who comes to the aid of Anne on the pinnacle of the Empire State Building. Fay Wray has achieved immortality as Kong's love, but in reality she does very little apart from scream and look pretty. There is no indication by the film makers how the captured Kong is restrained or even fed. The radio announcement which alerts Denham to Kong's urban rampage is facile and silly. Even sillier is the coconut-shell bra worn by a native woman back on the island.Verdict - For all its lapses, a monumental and ingenious movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterful storytelling effects masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though the effects have aged, Kong has the action and hardcore storytelling even eighty-three years later. The acting is believable enough to flow with the tale. The stop-motion master Willis O Brien does provide enough detail to display primitive jungles with filters and separate reels of film combined to make the dinosaurs come to life. Kong's battle with the airplanes is the iconic part of the movie on top of the Empire State Building. Robert Armstrong is the highlight of the film as he is a little eccentric in his search for a picture of Kong, but does show sympathy for the great ape at the end. Bruce Cabot is understandable as he isn't used to woman on board, but is more open- minded as he falls in love. Fay Wray is the scream queen of the 1930s as that is what she does mostly, the characters are fleshed out, but the Empire State Building keeps it alive; despite being stereotypical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie and it's subsequent Peter Jackson remake all the time as a kid. I will say that this does have some nostalgic value for me and I will say while it maybe pretty good as far as monster movies went back then it gets really dated now. The plot is that a film crew goes on an insane voyage to god knows where to shoot their latest movie but they can't find a female lead mainly because of the risky nature of the director. He does find a leading lady but as they get to an uncharted island they find out the people living there want to ritually sacrifice the leading lady to what I think they worship as a deity, Kong. It's up to the film crew, specifically a guy named Driscol to save the lead. They succeed and as a result Kong is later shown as a public spectacle. I will say some of the stop motion does get good at times but the effects aren't even done in such a way that I could just sit back and ignore it (eg, the original Godzilla) I know this was pretty advanced for the time but the shots that really get to me are the almost dead-eyed permanently smiling shots. I'll also say it is an undeniably racist and sexist movie, with the amount of "women are trouble" dialogue in it it's not hard to sigh at it all - the same can be said for the tribes in it and for the ship's Asian "Me no like" cook. There are many iconic moments from this movie but with how much it's aged horribly I'd stick a warning label on it for those that would get offended. For me personally it's because of how much this has aged that I don't like it, sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack brought audiences the first large-scale monster movie with their 1933 production, King Kong. It's unfathomable to think that in 1933 there were such effects available to tackle the King Kong fable. A fantastic directorial achievement, King Kong has lived on more than 80 years after its release date and seen countless remakes and adaptations. Telling the story of a film director who stares danger in the face at every turn and refuses to back down until he has exactly what he needs for his movies, even if that means risking the lives of his entire crew, King Kong is captivating from beginning to end. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) is an American film director known for his risky film shoots in which he photographs animals in their natural habitat for his movies. He hears about an island in which there exists great secrecy, and he is itching to see what lies behind the curtain. after assembling a film crew, and securing an actress, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) at the studio's request, he sets sail to find this mysterious island, with his camera in tow. No one, not even the captain of the ship knows what they will encounter when they reach the island, and everyone except Carl is trepidatious. After making land on the island, the crew sees a giant gorilla beast roaming about as king of the island. When he sees the beautiful Ann, he takes her as his "wife". It is now up to the crew, led by John Driscoll (Bruce Cabot) who has fallen for Ann, to get her back. There is certainly much to be said for the charms of classic cinema. One of these charms includes the sharp biting dialogue which made up most exchanges in films of the 1930's. The comedic quick-tongues that filled the screen in the 30's is definitely something lacking from cinema today. The sounds and dialogue that make up movies from this era is something missed by film buffs and casual movie watchers alike. The simple sounds and score in King Kong allow the action on screen to take center stage; aiding the action along without holding it back. Another fun part of watching classic films is the number of extras used. Without the availability of CGI and other effects to create the look of more actors than were actually used, there really were massive amounts of extras used on films that required many people in the scenes. A stunning nearly 50 minutes of build-up elapses in this film before we actually meet the titular beast, and it is paced just right, building the perfect amount of anxiety. Once we finally meet the beast, it is an incredible introduction scene in which he commands the screen entirely. I can't imagine, given the scope of the animal, seeing this film in theatres at the time of its release. King Kong certainly paved the way for all other action- adventure/monster movies to follow it. Just 11 years ago was the most recent adaptation of the film, proving that it has a cemented place in film history. Although the original 1933 version comes with big paw prints to fill, it is an exceptional testament that it has continued to remain relevant over 80 years after its release. Influencing a multitude of other films in the genre, King Kong is massive in scope and size and a true accomplishment in 1930's filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Cinematic Movie of All Time ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ask any movie fan to name one of the most influential movies of all time, an original cinematic creation, not based on any literary work, made of two four-lettered monosyllabic words and released in a year where the last two digits are the same, well, chances are that you'll get George Lucas' "Star Wars" as the answer. And it's a shame, because if one movie deserves the credit for having set Cinema's foot on its way to modernity, it certainly is "King Kong". Most of the box-office champs of the last thirty years, owe to the 1933 milestone. Still, who remembers Merian C. Cooper's, the father of King Kong? Who remembers Robert Armstrong, Carl Denham, who played the greedy and self-centered director? Who remember Bruce Cabot, the brave and handsome sailor? And last but not least, who remembers the names of the special effects technicians.There are only two names that didn't quite sink into oblivion: Fay Wray as the Golden girl, the godmother of all screaming queens, and in the film's romantic angle, the Beauty, and even more unforgettable, the Beast: King Kong. It is very revealing when the one true icon of the film is that giant gorilla who made the viewers grab their seat as if in they were aboard these Curtis hell-divers. There were monsters but there were actors behind the big screen: Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff. Here, for the first time, the icon is a handmade creation but one that seems, looks and sounds real, and that was before animated features and long before CGI technology would make it so easy it would become boring. And the wizardry that made King Kong alive is extraordinary, with what was at hands: stop-motion animations, uses of miniatures, projected screens, superposed layouts and matte paintings, and sometimes many effects in the same scene, "King Kong" is the ultimate milestone that foresaw the evolution of Cinema. And it's even more impressive when you know that the film was made in a short delay with a small budget. And this urge to come to a great final result, the many drafts in the scripts, all these chaotic contexts that made some masterpieces like "The Godfather", "Jaws" or "Apocalypse Now" possible, well, "King Kong" was no exception to it and it sure knew how to tell a riveting story. One of the best aspects of the scripts is that Cooper perfectly understood the merit of a long suspenseful build-up before showing the main character. Denham starts the teasing, talking of a mysterious creature in a remote Island, Ann (Fay Wray) rehearses some frightened emotions, we see the Natives in the Island during a ceremony in honor to a sort of God named Kong, and a bride put in an altar. That's the mark of true icons, their entrance is the result of a meticulous direction, and once King Kong raises his pretty head, the ride can start and it's one spectacular scene after another, a spellbinding experience that makes you forget all the little flaws such as the hammy acting and the rapid-fire lines delivery.Kong fights a T-Rex, s snake, a pterodactyl, he climbs on a ravine, holding his conquest on his hand, he shakes men off a tree bridge, there's no moment that doesn't make your heart pound. Even when he's not here, the sailors who go saving Ann get attacked by other prehistorical animals in scenes that must have studied by Spielberg when he made "Jurassic Park". But I make the film sound like some technical feat, there is more to it. There's the smile of Kong when he sees for the first time Ann's face, the way he delicately handles her as if she was a flower. And this is where the film is elevated to its status, there is a story, a heart, lying underneath the special effects. It has all the ingredients of a great adventure and action-packed fantasy film, and it also affords the luxury to be a beautiful romance.This is also the mark of great movies, even the most unsophisticated ones manage to inspire us some unexpected feelings. While we're inevitably scared by the sight of King Kong, the story is told in the 'Beauty and the Beast' angle, and it even gets to the beauty within the beast sometimes. This is a consummate character, larger-than-life and oddly three dimensional within his limitations. And of course, such a character called for a no less spectacular and iconic demise and while the Skull Island sequence alone was enough to make a great film, the cherry on the cake was the exhibition of King Kong in New York and the unforgettable Empire State Building climax, the culmination, literally, of the film's spectacular ambitions and the completion of its iconic status. Iconic, because tragic, King Kong had to set Ann down so he could fight the airplanes with one hand (he did get one) while hanging on the top of the Building with the other. Unfortunately, that was the condition for the airplanes to shoot him. protect himself while so the airplanes could shoot him, but then, when he finally got shot, he holds Ann again, as if he could take her with him. But he just holds her, with a sad resigned face, set her back and falls to his death. This is the kind of climaxes masterpieces are made on, both thrilling and emotional.And if the film isn't renowned for its one-liners, it still afforded one of the most memorable closing lines ever: "it was Beauty killed the Beast", And I love how that angle played in a self-reflexive way, there is a bit of Cooper in Denham, of Fay Wray in that obsession with romance, to please viewers in each side of the big screen. And to a certain extent, at the time of its release, "King Kong" became the eighth wonder of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is all-around a well acted, well scripted movie. Though the stop motion effects are extremely outdated but it adds to the films charm. King Kong tells the story of a film maker Carl Denham who is well know for shooting movies in exotic location decides to shot in an uncharted island but finds it to be inhabited by prehistoric monsters and a giant gorilla (King Kong) who falls in love with Ann Darrow the main female lead. Which Carl catches and bring back to NYC in which Kong escapes and terrorize New York until he finds Ann then Kong climbs up the empire state building and in one of the most famous scenes in film history is when Kong is shot down by planes and falls to the ground and the last line is said by Carl Denham who says "it was beauty who killed the beast". The scenes where dinosaurs paper in are very entertaining like the scene where a brontosaurs chases the crew and eats a few crew members and the scene where Kong fights a Tyranosaurs-Rex is revolutionary at it's time and is one of the best scenes in this movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason why I decided to give this film the rating that I did, is due to the fact that I can appreciate the fact that King Kong was one of the first Stop-Motion films, with King Kong himself being a stop-motion animated "character" in the film. For it's time, the special effects were cutting edge, but as a viewer who has watched films with the technology and the special effects that films have today, and even had 10 or 15 years ago, it was very difficult for me, personally, to take the "monster" as anything more than entertaining. This also made it difficult to take the "threat" of King Kong dropping Anna while on the Empire State building, was non-existent to me. Therefor, I found this film to be very drab, and drawn out, but in the same aspect can respect the film for what it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong (1933)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was an OK movie. I am so used to watching the most current version of King Kong made in 2005. I did however take into consideration, the era the film was made and the technology they had available at the time.King Kong is basically a love story. The film starts out showing how a famous filmmaker, Carl Denham decides to charter a ship to take him and his guests to this remote island filled with exotic and adventurous creatures.During their escapade on the island, they discover this giant gorilla (ape) named Kong. Kong falls in love with the Ann Darrow and decides to whisk her away to his mountain high on the island. Thought the movie, Kong has to keep Ann safe from all the other creatures on the island.Everyone leaves the exotic island, including Kong to journey back to the United States and this is where the chaos begins. Kong escapes and takes Ann with him and climbs one of the largest buildings in the world at the same time, trying to defend the woman he loves. In the end the girl doesn't get the creature and the creature definitely does NOT get the girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was somewhat disappointed by this classic monster film, being it was my first time seeing the original King Kong. The movie felt like it was dragging on way too much in the beginning build up scenes leading to a climax not worth the wait. The action the crew encounters on skull island is however an entertaining storyline. Given the restraints of the time and what not I was still extremely disappointed with the special effects. Everything from small things like the gunshots to the horrible robotic like creatures on the island. All these creatures motions and appearance were unrealistic, some of it painful to watch. Other films around this time period still had much better special effects for simple things such as gun shots. This film deserves credit however for trying to tackle the task of giant monsters in their film in the year 1933. The storyline of King Kong is truly and American classic that i think still deserves a proper remake. To this day I don't think any of the versions have done it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unmatched adventure as Kong secures Fay Wray and terrorizes New York City</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From start to finish, once Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot arrive at Skull Island this story never lets up. It's one tense action scene after another, without much respite, as the mighty Kong secures the sacrificial Fay Wray. This picture may cause you involuntarily to tense up, even if you've seen it before.I love all the special effects, but I'll single out a few for mention that impressed me last night upon a rewatch of this classic. All of the matte work is beautiful, such as the first view of the island, certain jungle scenes, and the lighting and cavernous entrance in Kong's cave. All of it lends a wonderful look that coordinates with Steiner's music score. The stegosaurus sequence blends the creature with the men in the foreground beautifully, just as is done elsewhere when Kong shakes the men off the tree trunk. And when that trunk crashes down into the ravine, it looks absolutely real. When Kong peers through windows, the effect on our feelings is tremendous. When he moves his eyes sideways in these views, it amazingly shows his subtle emotional change. The brontosaurus sequence is still looking good after all these years and, of course, so is the tyrannosaurus and the battle. Kong's first arrival to snatch Fay Wray still impresses as does the view of him when he pushes back the gate and the villagers flee. The cracking of the bolt is done beautifully. The entire derailment of the overhead train, with the view of Kong dead ahead, the people inside being tumbled, and his smashing the car are all expert. The montage of the people inside is top notch work that seems impossible to improve upon. There is some matte work in New York itself that is notable. The city at times looks art deco, and at other times foggy and mysterious. The Chrysler building in the background when Kong is atop the Empire State and the city laid out further below all look terrific. The peak tower and the depiction of Fay Wray in Kong's grasp or as he puts her down are all well-handled and impressive.Meanwhile, the story hangs together beautifully and the actors are memorable, right down to the Chinese cook on the ship and the ship's captain (Frank Reicher). Noble Johnson is suitably fierce. Last night was the first time I noticed that James Flavin had a line.Our hats are forever off to everyone who participated in making this film classic. They set a very high standard for future adventure stories and stories that have animated monsters of all kinds. Ray Harryhausen was to pick up the torch from Willis O'Brien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Greatest American Movie Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What you should know from the start is that "King Kong" has without doubt Cinema's greatest finale, and Willis O'Brien pioneered fantastic effects that has inspired generations of film-makers. It's a timeless tale of Beauty and Beast, that has brought many audiences down in tears and wonder.Classic monster movie fare. A director shoots his leading lady (Fay Wray) on the way to "Skull island", a land that time forgot. She is then sacrificed by the natives to the ape god "Kong", who is enamoured by her beauty. Eventually Kong is captured and brought back to New York for an utter spectacle.Like "Metropolis" (1929) before it. This feels like the first film in the western world to attempt a big budget fantasy setting and get it right. The acting becomes sub par against the movie effects, but that wonderful score by Max Steiner continues to elevate the picture into a masterful work of art.Final Verdict: Even while I'm writing this, I find it hard to try and sum up the movie in general because it really can't be done justice. You can never stop talking about how good "King Kong" really is and it feels criminal to cut the review short, but I'll just end up repeating myself. All I can say is forget "Citizen Kane" (1941), "King Kong" is the greatest American movie ever made. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 1933 version of King Kong directed by Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack starts out as a journey to the mysterious Skull Mountain to film a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*warning spoiler* The 1933 version of King Kong directed by Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack starts out as a journey to the mysterious Skull Mountain to film a movie. It stars Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot as part of the unlucky crew of the Venture that finds this island. The crew first encounters a native tribe as they are in the process of offering a human sacrifice for reasons they not know. While Carl Denham (Armstrong) is trying to film this the crew is spotted. The tribe takes an interest to Ann Darrow (Wray) and instead wants her as a sacrifice. The crew gets back to what they think is safety on the boat only to find out that the tribe has kidnapped Ann during the night. It is then that we find out what the sacrifice is for, a gorilla of epic size called King Kong. As the crew tries to hunt down Kong to get Ann back several of them loose their life at the hands of Kong or some of the other beastly creatures on the island. Kong also must deal with some of these creatures. It is in this time that we find out that Kong does not want to hurt Ann, he is trying to protect her at all costs. One member of the crew, Jeff Driscoll (Cabot) who had developed feelings for Ann is able to sneak her away from Kong and get her safely back to the Venture. Instead of doing the smart thing by leaving the island for good Denham talks the rest of the crew into using "gas bombs" to subdue the beast and bring it back to the states as a show everyone will want to see. They bring Kong back to New York to be part of a show which backfires horribly. Kong gets his hands on Ann and tries to protect him and her by climbing to the top of the Empire State building. Planes open fire on Kong causes him to drop Ann and eventually causing him to all to his eventual death.The theme of Cooper and Schoedsack's King Kong is be careful what you wish for. Carl Denham set off to film a great movie. Instead he got greedy and wanted to bring back the mythical creature Kong to be the greatest show ever. In the process he cost the lives of many men and scarred one woman for life. His greatest show never happened.The 1993 film Jurassic Park directed by Steven Spielberg is in many ways like King Kong. It is a mysterious island with mythical creatures. It is about John Hammond's (Richard Attenborough) desire to create a larger than life attraction of dinosaurs that goes horribly wrong. He is so farsighted in his vision that he doesn't see the harm that his vision has on others.A major technique used in King Kong is stop-motion animation. In stop-motion animation three dimensional objects are "moved repeatedly in increments of 24-per-second while being photographed (Boggs, Petrie, 2008)." This gives the impression that the object is in motion. This is shown throughout the movie in the movements of Kong and the other island creatures. Another important technique used in the film is the angles in which King Kong is shot. In almost every scene involving Kong he is filmed at an upward angle. This gives the impression that Kong is much bigger and more dominant than the other characters.The theme of being careful what you wish for is one that Carl Denham didn't think about. All he thought about when he saw Kong was dollar signs. He never gave much thought to the repercussions of trying to cage something that either doesn't want to be or can't be. In the end Carl finds out that his great dream of making Kong the center piece of a great show was not a good idea and that he got more than what he wished for. References Boggs, J., &amp; Petrie, D.

		<shortDescription>Sheer Kong magic from days of yore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even so much better than I remembered it. The numerous stop motion sequences are sheer magic (though may be an acquired taste in this day and age - for shame) and Fay Wray is the most beautiful and sensual beauty to have killed the beast in Kong history.The intro might be a little boring in comparison to the part where Kong and the other creatures come into play, but the story simply needs a build-up. Still, it could have done with more cinematic atmosphere to which the abundant dialogues could have taken a humbler backseat.Not a perfect 10 - let's say 9.8 - but a 10 is in order nonetheless. No comparisons here, though I will hopefully soon be re-checking Peter Jackson's remake - which I also love(d).</fullReview>

It was amazing to see the journey from the beginning to the end. You can only imagine the fun the actors had making this movie. My favorite part of the movie is when Kong battles a dinosaur, a giant snake, a giant bird and then human beings firing bullets and bombs at him. I felt that was the rising part of the movie. The only part of this movie I hate is when King Kong has to die. In this entire movie was done pretty well for a movie back in the 30s. Through out the movie it was exciting to watch and i had no problem watching this in black n white.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Directors Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack's achievements with King Kong still remained astonishing till today, nearly eighty years since its theatrical release.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the original King Kong, the film which spawned a remake in 1976 and more recently in 2005 by Peter Jackson, and of course a whole lot of imitations such as Mighty Joe Young. Its influences were immense, especially in the way adventure films were made after 1933. Moreover, over the years, it naturally became the yardstick against which monster movies would be measured. Directors Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack's achievements with King Kong still remained astonishing till today, nearly eighty years since its theatrical release.Though it might appear that way, King Kong is not a full-fledged monster movie; it's essentially a love story between two beings, a beauty-and- the-beast tale set in the hostile jungle of fictional Skull Island. While the plot is at times testing the limits of credibility (dinosaurs and all), the special effects take center stage when necessary. King Kong was one of the first films to use stop-motion technology, a technique still practiced today by the creators of the popular Wallace And Gromit series. The effects might seem too jittery and B-grade by today's standards, but they still continue to astound viewers new and old alike. Acting is above average, but that's not a surprise. Kong is the star of the show, and though he appears like a miniature clay model with varying heights in most of the scenes, there's a human side to him that can only be felt with the most subtle of observations. The score by Max Steiner set groundbreaking standards in film music in the early 30s. Nearly four-fifths of King Kong is accompanied by Steiner's music, driving the film along with a deep sense of adventure and mystery. King Kong has one of the most iconic scenes in cinematic history - the final battle atop of the Empire State building that leaves a despairing Kong to futilely defend against a fleet of attacking warplanes. Moreover, unforgettable sequences such as the duel between Kong and a T- Rex are stuff of schoolboy fantasy. Though personally, I prefer Peter Jackson's extended version of King Kong because the characters are developed with more verve and feeling, the 1933 original take is undoubtedly a masterpiece of its time.GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong has been known for being a film that made a huge impact on film. For the time this was jaw-dropping. There was all sorts of creativity put into it. As for story it's simple and classic. The film's score makes everything that was epic even more epic. Every last giant monster movie after this owes something to King Kong. Nothing would be the same, and all these awesome monsters wouldn't be here without it. The scene at the top of the Empire State Building is one of the most iconic scenes in all film. Despite its old age King Kong still effects modern cinema. People like Peter Jackson were largely inspired by it. King Kong is a king of a film.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me one of the 10 best movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty difficult to write anything fresh about King Kong, so I'll keep this short. I first saw this movie on t.v. when I was about 8 years' old, having never seen a stop-motion animation film, and having no idea what Kong was about. How lucky is that?! From Kong's first appearance I spent the rest of the movie in a paroxysm of terror - I couldn't look; I couldn't look away. I think I had nightmares for days about being pursued by a gigantic ape(!)and I couldn't stop talking about the film for weeks.And today, Kong to me is still an imaginative masterwork light years ahead of its overblown remake or turkey-style rip-offs. Every scene is lean and hungry; the plot, often criticised, actually plays like the logic of a dream. Fay Wray has gained immortality through the role of Anne Darrow (in real life she was a brunette!), but Robert Armstrong and Frank Reicher are also terrific.Willis O'Brien's creation has never been bettered, Kong has a personality a million cardboard CGI creations can't come close to. Peter Jackson's remake was okay, but bloated beyond belief. King Kong is full of great all time cinema moments. And that unforgettable ending. I admit, when I was 8, I cried. And my adult self just about takes it on the chin.To me, Kong stands alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong was produced in 1933 as a horror/action that set the way for a new way of special affects in movies. It is also considered to be one of the first and one of the best original monster movies. The film was co-directed by Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack. Starring Fay Wray as Ann Darrow, captive who will be sacrificed to Kong. She is kidnapped by island natives to be given to Kong. The movie switches from the jungles of an island in the Indian Ocean to the jungle of New York City. Kong becomes the captive, and in a climactic, legendary scene, he takes Darrow to the top of the Empire State Building.The special affects as we see Darrow held in Kong's hands, almost like she was a rag doll. Darrow's acting really wasn't the greatest. She does play a good damsel in distress, but this really wasn't a standout performance. The directing of the action was done very well. I think if anything, Kong became the standout performance because the movie had been remade 3 times, and Kong has become an icon. It is a classic tale of beauty and the beast. One would almost be led to believe that Kong had human-like feelings for Wray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kongfessions of a Killer Ape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never mind that insanely moving death scene atop the Empire State building; to really place Kong's love for Ann Darrow into some kind of perspective, one has to remember that Kong routinely bit the heads off Skull Island virgins as if they were marshmallows on sticks. That was his job description, in fact. Twist head off, drink arterial spray. Crush torso, use tibia as toothpick. Yet being the size he was (big), and the size they were (much smaller), he'd presumably require quite a few little round balls, chewy on the outside, nutty on the inside, to fill him up. And one marshmallow (plus stick) every month does not a contented killer ape make. Imagine being asked to subsist on a single Malteser and Twiglet for 30 days. You'd want to smash a few huts in too. (True, pterodactyls will halt the pangs, but taste worse than guano.) Kong's obsession for Darrow, then, is a triumph of higher love over base hunger; you can either cherish it or eat it. It looks good enough to eat; but you don't. Ape hath no greater love than to ignore his rumbling tum. Truly, we're in last Rolo territory, and then some.Aside from such spiritual considerations, King Kong the movie is also randier than a 1970s British sex comedy. Having peeled her blouse off, our furry chum actually tickles Fay Wray's revealed right breast - to an accompanying Benny Hill-style orchestration. "Diddle diddle diddle!" giggle composer Max Steiner's clarinets. Just as you're thinking, 'No, I didn't see that", he does it again. "Diddle diddle diddle!" And sniffs his fingers. Unsurprisingly, RKO censored the scene for six decades, now restored on DVD.But how exactly did Mister Monkey think he was going to consummate the relationship anyway? Stick her in his ear?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do the monster mash- Kong remains a wonder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong roared into theatres- and into cinematic legend- in 1933, over 75 years ago. Even today it's an impressive monster movie, albeit a flawed one- it benefits from an appealing story, a great monster character, and some terror. It's a horror movie- hence why I'm reviewing it along with other horror and Halloween-themed movies and TV episodes throughout this October- but it's also more.Admittedly parts of it have not aged well- some of the dialogue and acting are a little rough. Driscoll's dislike for women is distasteful. The 2005 remake improves on it in a number of departments, with scarier natives, better effects and a more believable love story. Too bad it went on too long.Yet the original remains the best. A colourful story is unfolding, with talk of island legends and mysterious gods. Fay Wray plays Ann, and delivers a good performance- for example, when she's acting terrified for Denham, she's convincing. She's also beautiful- she looks hot when Driscoll tells her he loves her. The special effects mostly still work, if you watch the black and white version (keeping it shadowy is a good idea, I guess). The only things that looks bad are the close-ups of Kong's face, which are spoofed by The Simpsons in Treehouse of Horror III, which is a classic itself. When Kong shakes the log, he still looks good. But it's the story that gives him his power- with adventure on the island, terror as he attacks the native village, and chaos when he rampages through New York, particularly with the train. The movie ends with a wicked bit of sympathy for the devil- Kong has killed and terrified many, but seeing him hold the girl he loves one last time is oddly sad. That's a classic trick in storytelling, pulled off here with ease.Happy Halloween.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, since the 2005 version of King Kong is being the talk of the day lately, I found it most appropriate to talk about the original King Kong film from 1933. But what can you say about it, it's one of the best giant monster movies of all time, and in his life, King Kong had a son, fought Godzilla, and was even the prime inspiration for Donkey Kong. So, let's get started.The stop motion animation is to be taken seriously. It's so good, I can hardly believe that it's not real. The acting is also something to bring up. Fay Wray as Ann Darrow tops Naomi Watt's Ann Darrow any day. I also believe that the people who played the Skull Island villagers did a good job. They still freak me out to this day.It's a shame the 70s version wasn't like this and the 2005 film. I mean, come on, a man in a gorilla suit! Why couldn't they use the cool stop-motion animation like in this film. Don't even get me started on King Kong Lives. But in the end, King Kong is awesome, no matter what. When I am 100 years old, I will be saying, the 1933 and 2005 versions of King Kong, they started it all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 9/17/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir- Merian C. Cooper): Excellent adventure and groudbreaking effects in this classic film. For it's time, I'm not sure how they could have done any better with this film. Excellent claymation and incorporating it with the live action to make a truly exciting and believable looking movie. The story is about an adventurous filmmaker departing to an uncharted island to film a picture about a beauty and a beast (that is yet to be known or seen by anyone outside of the natives that live there). When he gets there, he encounters the natives sacrificing one of their own to it, but the blond played by Fay Wray entices them more and they want her for the sacrifice instead. They steal her and sacrifice her to Kong and the crew then attempts to rescue the maiden running into many other enormous creatures on their quest. They capture the girl and the beast and then take him back to New York to display for money. The rest of the story you probably already know and I won't destroy it for someone who hasn't seen one of the three movie versions(which is unlikely). Anyway, even though this movie was made in 1933 it still amazed me on how it was done and is also exciting. This is a one of a kind movie that should be enjoyed by many generations and hopefully will be now that it's been restored to allow excellent viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 4 years old and as of this comment I am 15. King Kong (1933) has never lost it's magic and is quite simply, one of the greatest films ever made! Everyone know the plot: People go to island, girl gets kidnapped and sacrificed to a giant gorilla of a god called Kong. The rest is cinematic history as the story unfolds to it's ultimate conclusion.The main credit of this film is the stop-motion work by Willis O'Brien on Kong and all of the dinosaurs. It is the animation that really makes this film a classic. Nearly every little detail is perfect and there is barely any flaws in the continuity of the effects. The jungle sets and New York scenes are fabulous and work well as two different types of jungle. Although the characterisations are quite plain (they are given no back stories and have very little depth) the cast do a good job of portraying them, especially Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong. The producers did make good use of their past experiences for the film as the film expedition is based mostly on the real life expeditions of Merian c. Cooper and Ernest B. Scheodsack. When watching the movie, you can see that it had been planned out over a long period of time. The camera angles are clever and certain key scenes are particularly inventive like Kong's attack on the elevated subway train and the end. Other scenes such as the T-Rex fight and the stegosaurus charge are great but they could probably never measure up to the infamous lost spider pit scene which should not have been removed. But what of Kong himself? Yes he may be a 25 foot gorilla and Merian C. Cooper wanted to portray him as a fearsome beast but in the end you will feel sympathy for him as he finally sees his own blood. The look of shock on his face is totally real and a touch of greatness. Kong is a creature that evokes fear and sympathy. It is amazing to think that anyone could take an 18 inch model and make everyone believe it is a giant gorilla. But Willis O' Brien did that and created a movie icon. He is the 8th Wonder of the World. He is KING KONG!</fullReview>

It may take half an hour to make landfall, but once it reaches Skull Island it's almost non-stop action, packing in more action than any of the remakes in a much tighter running time: Kong's first appearance, a charging Stegosaurus, a carnivorous Brontosaurus attack, the log-rolling scene, Kong's battles with a Tyrannosaurus Rex, a snake-like lizard and a Pterodactyl, Anne and Driscoll's escape, and Kong's destruction of the village and capture never give you time to stop for breath and still haven't been equalled in 74 years of action cinema for sheer relentless adrenaline-pumping excitement.Reworking the Lost World formula but adding a stronger narrative and a bigger star role for the beast on the rampage in a modern world far more savage than his island domain, James Creelman and Ruth Rose's screenplay may crack wise but it still takes the story seriously, creating the greatest of all Beauty and the Beast stories. Unlike the remakes there's no effort to make Kong sympathetic ? he kills a lot of people just because he's p***ed off ? nor, more importantly, to imply that Ann has anything other than fear for him. Yet it's that that ultimately makes him sympathetic. He doesn't know any better, but they should. It's easy to see how the enslaved and hunted Kong became co-opted by the Black Power movement? Unlike most monster movies, it's genuinely spectacular, shot on an epic scale with massive sets and hundreds of extras, and the undervalued Ernest B. Schoedsack's direction still impresses. The no expense spared aesthetic also stretches to Kong, who gets an enormous amount of screen time compared to his more budget-conscious followers. The animation is still remarkably detailed ? the T-Rex, introduced scratching its head, is a particularly impressive creation from its rippling tail to its slack jaws that so fascinate Kong after he's killed it. Even Kong's rippling fur, an unintended side-effect of animator Willis O'Brien's finger's compacting the fur every time he moved the model, works, almost as if the wind was blowing it. Exciting, funny, savage, frightening, ultimately tragically moving and still the biggest beast in the movie jungle, Kong lives up to his billing as the Eighth Wonder of the World and still rules supreme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My personal favorite movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now look, this movie is good, but flawed. It is very melodramatic and the once brilliant special effects are limited. Directing is even below standard. Some actors are really bad.I just named some negative things. But I still love it. Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong are good. I still like the melodramatic script and the special effects are a little nice to look at. I like the black and white images. The scenes are really good (preferably the log bridge scene is my favorite scene) There is great emotion in this movie on kong's part. You hate him up until the end where you see he is dyeing by the monster of modern day. I felt sympathy for an ape who killed several dozen people. There isn't really a protagonist or an antagonist. You can decide which side you are on.This is also a movie if you don't feel its modern enough, see the remake. I know this is a review for the original(which I think is superior to Peter Jacksons) , but that was a great, faithful remake.Yes this movie is flawed. It isn't as well done as movies like the godfather or anything else that awesome. but this is my guilty pleasure. Also think of where cinema today would be without this. This is a movie that takes you from your bad day and lest you enjoy yourself. See it. "Its the thrill of a lifetime"- Carl Denham</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One Original Monster Flick! Features Great Dinosaurs and Kong monkeying around with perpetual screamer, Miss Fay Wray!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producer/Director:Merrian C.Cooper &amp; Ernest B. Schoedsack, story by Cooper &amp; Edgar Wallace, Chief Technicians:Willis O'Brien/Marcel Delgado,Starring:Robert Armstrong,Fay Wray,Bruce Cabot,Frank Reicher,Sam Hardy,Noble Johnson, Steve Clemente, James Flavin. Musical Score by Max Steiner. RKO Radio Pictures(1933). First of all, let's begin by thanking Peter Jackson for the big, blockbuster Homage to the original 1933 KING KONG. Usually, when someone makes or attempts to make a new version of an old film, we view them with a certain level of skepticism. When the film to be made is a Gem, a Mastepiece or a One of a Kind Genre-starter.Yes, in spite of this writer's doubts and unnecessary pre-release tirades about the then unseen final theatrical release. Mr. Jackson and company succeeded in the nearly impossible.As for the original, KING KONG(RKO Radio Pictures, 1933), it is no less a marvel and continues to attract new fans from succeeding generations. The changing trends and the 'march of time' surely have had their affects on today's viewer, but like any other basically good and substantial work, it remains above the 'dating' syndrome-the single, one-way ticket to scrap heap of the "Camp" crowd.And it's not as if we don't notice any differences in old films, as compared to any "modern" film. We no more look at a recently made movie and a Mack Sennett Keystone Kops comedy short in the same way, as we would view our Grandparents' Wedding Photos as being no different than our Sisters' Albums.In order to truly enjoy a vintage film, one must get into the proper frame of mind for a better frame of reference.Let's start of with the film and year. Okay, how 'bout oh, KING KONG (1933), how's that one? We give it a thorough scrutinizing, coming up with its basic pedigree. It's a Sound, Black &amp; White, Feature Film of the Action/Fantasy Drama.Our next task calls for taking a good look around the World of 1933 in order to understand the impact that a work of science fiction/fantasy would have on a movie goer then. We must evaluate all circumstances.For example; in the film, the crew is going on an unknown length voyage from a wintry looking New York City to an uncharted tropical island. It turns out that the location of this 'Skull'Island is somewhere down around Borneo, Sumatra and Java-only more South toward the vast expanses of wide open Pacific. We must keep in mind the significance of the world's technological state at that moment in time.In today's World, it seems that just about everybody has a cellphone of their own. In the 1930's and even much later, such an invention surely was strictly Science Fiction, Buck Rogers stuff. In contrast to today, when even any Grade School Kid could phone Borneo. Well it was such a distance in those days, as it may as well have been Mars! The story of a giant creature, completely out of sync with our world is one that has deep roots; dating back to tales of Giants, Dragons and Ogres. Their influence can be found in the earliest days of the cinema. Cartoonist Windsor McKay's Animated Cartoon GERTIE THE DINOSAUR(1914)* is a fine example of the "Monster Creature" film lineage. THE LOST WORLD (First National,1925) could be considered as being directly ancestral to KONG. Having names like Willis O'Brien and Marcel Delgado, it was truly a cousin or sibling.There have been many essays and analytical pieces written about K.K. over the years. We can recall an essay in an English 101 Class we(I) took at The City College of Chicago, Woodrow Wilson Branch. The year was 1964, the essay entitled, "What ever happened to King Kong?", and the author offered some theories about why the films'popularity had't waned over the years. Among them as to why it was very popular in the Black Community was that it portrayed a huge dark, human-like character smashing the buildings, the commercial districts, the hotels and even the transit system of White Society in New York. He also included the destruction of Policemen. Well, he has his rights to express opinions, no matter how wrong; we have a modest theory of our own.Kong is an uncontrolled, super powerful, example of the Natural World. It's potential for use to man and possessing the key to untold wealth, make it something that all in Our World would covet. Inspite of Man's puny power and poor judgment, he tries to possess and control same. And like the Genie of the Bottle (or say, Nuclear Power) anything can be destructive to us when improperly loosed on the World. And then, what to do to control same? * There was also a J.R. Bray Studios GERTIE THE DINOSAUR knockoff released to the public 1n 1915.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many Science Fiction films have been remade twice &amp; spun off more than 10 sequels plus cartoons, comics, radio dramas? This film has done all of that &amp; more. What is amazing is that it came from little RKO studios.RKO was never known for big budget films. Yet somehow in 1933 they released a film which would influence generations after it. The cast of Faye Wray &amp; others would be known for this film. In actuality though, it was special effects that were far beyond what movie viewers could imagine back then which made this a great film.This is one of the earlier films to have Dinosaurs, &amp; prehistoric scenery. While today it doesn't seem like much, why is it that King Kong has become a part of the English language &amp; a major piece of Americana? While this has become dated, it still outranks its modern remakes as far as telling the story. It's imagination has reached so far, that in 1993, Jurassic Park recreated this story without Kong. That is indeed the ultimate compliment is the timelessness this has created. King Kong is the most borrowed upon epic film ever.163</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I enjoy a good black &amp; white movie (old or modern), not see a piece of audiovisual work only, it's much, much more than that. I feel I'am in a time burble made of dreams visions with my feelings as horizon. This Fantastic piece of work made in the depressive 30s, is not an evasion movie, is a Powerful and unforgettable Love Story of the Cinema Story. Here, the Beauty and the Beast tale is projected in our subconscious with features of huge and thrilling beauty. Kong is pure instinct itself. And Kong's Love is powerful feeling in crude status in a moment of Chaos when this passion is shabby in it's own environment with catastrophic results (Kong destroys and goes through Island's gates causing death). When that basic mind structure (our own cerebral base is equal to apes = Kong and reptiles = Skull Island's dinosaurs) push our superior mental layers for to hold and unit with the desire being, must be challenged in a decisive final. The perfect place for that Kongfrontation is the most highest phallic symbol of its time, and our feeling must be repressed for the society by means of "perfecting" barbaric elements. King Kong is not a perfect movie but, is a perfect example of that imperfect miracle called emotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pinnacle of classic movie making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong tells the age old story of beauty and the beast. Ruthless film maker Carl Denham recruits out of work actress Ann Darrow to come with him to Skull Island to film a movie. Upon arriving there, they discover the island is inhabited by savage natives who want Ann as a sacrifice for a beast that they call Kong. When they capture Ann and offer her to the giant ape, Denham and his crew set out to rescue her...and capture Kong to bring to New York for monetary gain. King Kong is a story that everybody knows, and this movie's reputation strongly precedes it.Merian C. Cooper and Willis O'Brien got together in the early 30's with an idea to make a movie loosely based off of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World. They changed the characters and made the main creature a giant ape that would be brought back to New York and put on Broadway. In the early 1930s, this was a very ambitious project. Not many movies were made about giant monsters terrorizing a big city before 1933, and those type of movies didn't even become popular until the late 50s. Therefore, it would be right to say this movie was before its time. Even though when watching it now the acting and special effects are crappy beyond belief, you have to look at what this was like in the 1930s. King Kong was done with clay, and they were able to make him destroy New York City streets. The claymation process was beyond its time as well. They even went through the process of making his fur move in the wind. The cinematography is great for a 30s movie, and it flows just like a much newer film.There's not really much I can say for the acting in this movie because the acting is the same in every 30s movie. However, I do like the characters that the screenwriter created. They were about as dynamic as 30s movie characters could get.Overall, King Kong is the definition of a classic movie that influenced many film makers in the years to come.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The foundational sci-fi/creature/adventure/effects film - it's why there are movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kong remains the prototypical, sometimes cheesy, adventure/creature film. Many of its puppet stunts still look convincing (and many don't, something noted by certain critics even at the time). Many are such art, it almost doesn't matter. The problem they faced was that while they knew of motion blur, because they saw films frame by frame every day in editing, they didn't incorporate that into their puppet's movements. They were concerned with many things, particular layering methods, and keeping the puppets propped up for the transfer guage to the next frame. Also some rear projection, as Kong lying on the beach or breaking his chains, lost some shadow and seem faded as a result. Etc.The stop motion models were well-constructed, particularly the armatures. Except for certain refinements, these probably were not substantially improved by Harryhausen, later, carrying on the same 'O.B' tradition. The full-size models, the close-up face of Kong in various scenes, were probably only slightly less convincing than those used in films half a century later. Kong demonstrated various matte and layering methods which became standards, and not just for adventure or creature films. Instead of layering in a lab, many times they literally had to rewind the same film and shoot double or triple exposures of the original stuff they had just shot. Glass was painted for foreground - foreground miniatures were used - middle glass and miniatures - fuzzy painted backgrounds - more painted glass - more dioramas props and miniatures. And all of that was lined up in front of the camera. This is all the early 1930s. The great grotto where Kong fights the 'snake' had nothing but layering going on. And there is so much of that thought, and sleight. For that, for the integrated musical score, and more, it is a first class film, and remains so to this day.It's a retelling of the tale of Beauty and the Beast, the beast being tamed by beauty in the fable, juxtaposed with the natural history museum fad of the day in all the newly discovered dinosaur bones on display. O'Brien actually had a stop-motion dinosaur film in the works, called Creation. Some of that was apparently used in Kong. Cooper and Shoedsack had been nature documentarians, roughing the 'wilds', taking risks with wild animals in sort of a precursor to the Aussia adventure seekers on cable TV, today. They were cowboys with cameras, and ten-gallon hats, or whatever (B-westerns, John Wayne to the rescue, were also big in that era). RKO was in trouble. Cooper came in (it's said that Armstrong's Denham is a dead ringer for Cooper). Cooper had wanted to do a film about an ape, or one giant ape. He saw what O'Brien was doing, and killed the project. That was going to go into something, better. So O'Brien, O.B. ('obie') as they called him, became the master animator for King Kong, heading up a staff of very talented people.In this BatB meets the Lost World meets Zane Gray, some scenes have an originality now passed to clich. The attempt to win Ann's favor so that she would board the ship is one. There's the 'log toss'. The curtain going up on the 8th wonder is another, of course. Top of the Empire State Building. The final line, that the beast went 'soft' and was killed by beauty. There are so many. Kong is almost lovable in the final scenes of tenderness toward Ann. The puppet brought tears to the audience. That emotionalism is surprising in the 1930s, where a hardier class of people were to forget the death toll, and that the 'sensitive, sweet monkey' plucked a woman from her bed, moments before, and dropped her to the pavement far below, or injured or killed people walking by, in cars, in the train he tore up all the while holding Ann in his right hand, and never mind the number of the Venture's crew and villagers, rocked, socked, chomped in half or stepped on. Lovable Kong. And it's Denham who rightly bears the shame (and consequences, see Son of Kong).As for the acting, Wray, a famous silent film actress, seemed a bit too camera-aware in the important 'softening' scene with Cabot, who seems to play the tough guy a little too tough to be convincing, in some scenes. I think she wanted to play it, in a number of scenes, as a sort of 'sassy broad', a Mae West, or whatever 'sassy' sorts were popular in the era. But her role is basically just to, scream. She seemed uncomfortable, at least in the early sailing scenes. But like these creature/effects films of today, it's not about the characters - it's all about the dinosaurs (and in this case, Kong). These particular characters, particularly Ann and Jack, and Skipper Engelhorn and Denham, just have entered into the culture, on the strength of this movie, which was in many ways decades ahead of its time.It was a film where black actors played fierce and threatening roles. They weren't shuffling and rolling their eyes. They were effectively sneaking on board to abscond with Ann, in order to please their 'god'. It was intended, I think, to ape (if that's the word) a documentary. People had not seen such things. It was just more of the spectacle, more of the 'amusement park', more of the thrill. But it wasn't condescending, save for the emotionalism. At the end, the villagers join with the crew to keep Kong out, but quickly fail. These are not bloodthirsty, maniacal murdering savages. They are just the islanders living in a magical and supremely dangerous fantasy island.A great film! It's an effects film with a B+ plot, with A characters that transcended the film, and some A+ effects, that if you watch are almost artistry, even by today's standards. In a way, and judged by the standards of its era, it can never be surpassed.</fullReview>

What I think truly makes this adventure movie a true classic, is that it was made by real adventurers. The sheer daring of the special effects and the willingness to finance the score themselves shows how much belief they had in this project, and how far they were willing to go to make it something special. Rather than make a hack story, they set out to make the best movie they could, and make it one of the best looking movies they could.

		<shortDescription>A classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong is the damnedest picture I have ever seen. Sure, in the long run, it's an insane story about gassing a giant monkey and then shooting him off a building, but the story itself has a timeless quality to it that make it stand the test of time. Since the birth of fiction, there have been stories involving monstrous beasts and the women who love them. And in 1933, Ernest Shoedsack and Merian C. Cooper got the idea for a movie based on that concept. With the help of the special effects pioneer Willis O'Brien, they brought to life one of my favorite movie of all time. King Kong was a milestone in special effects; it included the use of revolutionary processes like stop-motion animation, rear projection, and matte shots. Of course, each of these processes had already been used in other films, with varying degrees of success, but King Kong was the first time that all of them had been used at the same time. There's one scene, in particular, that shows this unique synthesis: King Kong, the stop-motion model, is matted in in such a way that he's grabbing at a rear projected image of the character Jack Driscoll. The impact of such visuals on audiences back in 1933 is just unimaginable for me, because to them, what they were seeing was patently impossible. In today's world, anything you can imagine, odds are, someone with more money than you has already put it on the screen, but for the time, a giant ape interacting with real people must have been the cinematic equivalent of the president calling you to let you know he bought you a robot.Why is King Kong still such a powerful film? Well, aside from the special effects, and the fact that it started a trend of fantasy picture that continues to this day, the movie is tragic, in a way. As Dino De Laurentiis said: "No one cry when Jaws die. When monkey die, everybody cry." And you know something? Despite seemingly doing his best to drag the film industry to its death through the 70's and 80's (including a ridiculous remake of Kong in 1976,) the man was right about one thing. When the monkey dies, everybody cry. Uh, cries. I didn't get it when I was kid, though. To me, he was just another monstrous invader that had to be stopped. But now, I can look back and see that he wasn't an invader. We were the invaders. Hell, we were the kidnappers and the killers, too. Not only did we take this animal away from his home, we took his woman away from him, and we killed him when he decided he wasn't going to take it anymore.Of course, I don't want to give the wrong impression. Sure, I appreciate the movie for its cinematic significance, but there is another, just as valid reason: It's a movie about a giant monkey fighting dinosaurs! How cool is that? It's why I loved the movie as a kid, and one of the main reasons that I still love it today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Successful Movie Of Its Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been other attempts to bring something non-existent in real life into the the big screens before Kong, but they were never done with the spectacular realism of this movie. The character Kong is absolutely believable as a living entity and set the bar for other fantasy/sci-fi movies that followed. This movie also pioneered many special effects techniques which other movies have used until wide spread usage of CGI in recent years. In this sense, this is a one of a kind movie, and may be said that it is a monument of 20th century movie making. In a strange way it also captures the "dark" screen play and cinematography that became popular in the '90s well before its time. All the ingredients were well thought out, the plot, characters, the Kong nemesis T-Rex et. al., back drop of Empire State Bulding, etc. all thought provoking, and above all something we all wanted to see. It showed the potential of movie as a media to depict a world that we could never see in real life, but with sufficient truism that we could experience as our own. In this sense it was precursor to other out of this world movies such as the "Star Wars", and the "Jurassic Park".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was about five year old I heard my teenage uncles talking about King Kong going to be broadcast on TV that evening. My parents thought it was too scary and wouldn't let me watch. My younger uncle..about 16 then told me he didn't see why I shouldn't see it. So he told me the story. Since then I have seen the movie dozens of times. The 1976 update remake fails to capture the story, drama, or the basic feel of the horror of being lost in the "Lost World" jungles.Peter Jackson's recent remake captures the original plus much more. But he pays tribute to the original throughout his movie; and for good reason. The original is still great to watch. If you can get a copy of the 'uncut' version you will appreciate it more. There is a great sexual tension between Kong and Ann that is lost in the uncut versions. His tearing off parts of her clothing, playing with her and then sniffing his fingers?... It is no wonder it did not pass the censors. Then he drops her into a pool of water and when she first surfaces part of her dress is down and she flashes a breast.Not even Peter Jackson dares to re create these scenes. One wonders what Cooper was thinking. He certainly didn't think they would pass the censors. And Fay? What a daring actress. Both the 1933 and the 2005 versions are excellent 'Love' films and renew the myth of Beauty and the Beast. Forget the critics of the film who suggest racial overtones. In the 1930s the primitives who were ingenuous to the tropical jungles were dark skinned. To make them anything else would be silly. And Kong? Should Cooper have made him an albino ape to avoid racial overtones? How silly that would have been. And someone would have found racism in that since apes are not usually white.I won't spoil the ending by telling what happens..as if anyone alive doesn't know. Lets just say the nuptials are never consummated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is a classic there's no doubt about it. It is, in my opinion one of the greatest fantasy movies ever made. When everyone says fantasy people think of recent films such as MATRIX, LORD OF THE RINGS and STAR WARS, although again classic people do not remember the original classics before them, KING KONG being one of the greatest.The film is full of suspense throughout, the first being as the ship approaches the island which has not yet been discovered by man, (or has it??) nobody knows what to expect, what inhabitants are on the island etc. When we, the audience, first see KING KONG itself is another example of suspense. The music used leads to the presence of KONG, is quiet and eerie, but as we first see the KING, it bursts into a loud musical BANG, referring to the height, strength and sheer god-likeness (does that word exist :S) of the gigantic mammal.The characters are built very well. The love connection between Ann (played by Fay Wray) and Jack Driscoll (played by Bruce Cabot) are shown clearly. At the start you see Jack not having time for women, but on the voyage to Skull island, his view of women changes as he is introduced to Ann. His love for her is shown throughout, as he takes on KING KONG for his love as he progresses through the unknown island in order to rescue her from the over-large monkey. The greed of the character Carl Denham is also visible, the obvious example, bringing the KING gorilla itself to human contact in NYC, in hope that it will increase his reputation as a director.With the release of the recent KING KONG by Peter Jackson, it would be nice to see the similarities and differences between old and new interpretations of the film. With actors such as Adrien Brody, Naomi Watts and Jack Black in the key roles, it will be good to see them fit into these roles also. It's shocking to here that people have not yet seen the original KING KONG, and i urge them to see it. It's classic 'fairy tale' stuff which can relate to any age. Watching this as a kid on the TV was very exciting, with every boy's dream of seeing life dinosaurs and large gorillas on screen. Watching it again recently, it reminds me of the excitement i felt as a kid. I throughly good watch, and i fully recommend for any one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rewind back to March 2, 1933; the Depression, unemployment, misery. However you find a dime left of your paycheck to go to the movies so that you can escape the day's hard times. If you went to see "King Kong", chances are you would've been blown away, just like I was. I had seen this picture for the first time when I was 4 years old, but did not see it in it's entirety until I was 20 years old. It is a landmark in the cinema not only for it's special effects, but for the versatility of those effects in telling the story. Robert Armstrong is solid in his performance as Carl Denham, a character to whom many people say embodies co-director Merian C. Cooper. Fay Wray is great, but I still think her best role is in "Mystery of the Wax Museum", produced the same year as "Kong". O'Brien's treatment of the Kong character is beautifully handled. Definitely a big advancement from 1925's "The Lost World" if at least for the fact of how well done the jungle sequences were done (minus the spider pit sequence, which sadly remains lost, DAMN CENSORS!). There's really nothing more I can say about this wonderfully entertaining motion picture that hasn't already been said by almost every film critic in the past 70+ years. But I will say that this is the far superior version to the 1976 Jessica Lange tank job that dares to share it's name with this classic. Can't wait to see what Peter Jackson's Kong has in store for us!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong 1933: Ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong 1933: Ahead of its timeThere have been a few visionaries throughout history. There have been people who inexplicably were able to make predictions of how things would be in the future. Jules Verne predicted helicopters and submarines before their invention. Leonardo DaVinci made several predictions of future machines and their uses. It happens on occasion. One occasion was the making of the film King Kong which was released in 1933. Edgar Wallace, Merian C Cooper, Ernest B. Schoedsack, and Willis H O'Brien, Conspired together to create a masterpiece of a movie. Never before has such outlandish concepts been put together in one film. And while the effects used were not brand new, they were still in their infancy and generally unknown. Sometimes in life, an amazing amalgamation of circumstances intertwine, and congeal into greatness?this is what happened with King Kong. Each party mentioned above came into contact with the other at the right time to get this movie made. The filming techniques were new, the idea was unheard of, and the gall to try it was inspired. The reason King Kong was ahead of its time, is that it should never have happened at all. Ever have a dream that in your waking moment seems to be an inspired fantasy that should be shared with the world, but upon further consideration, when your mind is free from the fog of sleep, you just know it does not make sense and would never make it in the real world? This story line is one of those. Imagine being the business person on the other end of this idea being pitched to you:I want to make a movie about a 25 foot tall gorilla, living on an uncharted island populated with dinosaurs and natives, that is found by a movie director and some sailors, who capture the beast, take it to New York and let it loose to ravage the city and get shot off the empire state building by biplanes!Get the men in white?is the appropriate response?especially in 1933. Aside from the logistical challenges that such a story would not doubt provide, who would pay to see it in the depression era? That this film ever got made is the lesser of two mysteries, the primary being it made tons of money, and a month later there was nearly no one in America who did not know who King Kong was. Without the right people coming together at the right time, this movie would not have been the movie that it is. Who else but Willis O'Brien could have brought the title character to life? Who else but Merian C Cooper would have been ballsy enough to produce it? Edgar Wallace supplied the story, and Schoedsack supplied the support. It boggles the mind. Why was King Kong ahead of its time? Adventure fantasy did not take off at that time like it did in the late 1970's. It could have, look how hard O'Brien's protg Harryhausen worked at it. Look how many others tried to replicate Kong's greatness. But none succeeded like George Lucas with Star Wars. Once Star Wars entered into film history with its "Blockbuster" creation, the time of the fantasy adventure film had arrived. While it has slowed or waned in the years since, the fantasy adventure film is still a summer movie mainstay, and it is likely to continue. Now King Kong has an opportunity to make itself shine again, with the Peter Jackson version on our doorsteps as I write this. Hail to the King. King Kong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is one of my favorite films of all time and it's one of the greatest. This adventure story follows a group of show businessmen and adventurers as they make their way onto Skull Island. It seems as if the isle is deserted, but that is definitely not the case.They eventually find people that live there and those natives kidnap Fay Wray, the only girl in the expedition. These natives present Wray to the monstrous ape known as Kong. Now the adventurers must get her back from the king of the island.The catch is that Kong isn't willing to give up this woman so easily because he's starting to fall in love. What happens after Wray is finally rescued is something that will never be equaled on film because it's such an amazing sight.King Kong is definitely something that everyone must see. The film takes special effects to a whole new level and, no matter how many fake computer effects they use in ripoffs, the stop-motion animation is the closest thing to the real thing and that makes the film brilliant.If you've never seen it and really don't know what to expect, you're in for a treat. This is one of the most fun times you'll have with a movie and you'll really enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah i remember this film from my childhood, mostly spent behind the chair looking at the screen of the TV when i felt safe. Very scary movie for the six year old i was. I remember the screams, the jungle, the ship and natives, and the look on Kong's face as he stared perplexedly into Fay's face. A look of unrequited love and when i saw it as a fourteen year old how sad i felt for him. It is one of those great movies where regardless of the motive or talent in making it, it through your biographical element allows subtexts to play out and unfold as you go through your life. I guess that's why it is timeless even though it can seem dated. And i've managed to get a copy on DVD, can't wait to play it. Go Kong Go. Part of me wishes he had whacked those planes and won out. Good lord you don't think it was some sort of political take on foreign barbarians besmirching the honour of American virginal woman do you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong was my first experience of fantasy stop motion animation adventure and i was only 7 years old. It terrified me that much i had nightmares for weeks but it left an indelible mark on my life's love for movies and adventure. Lord of the Rings comes a very close second for modern day movie making at its best and the link here is that Peter Jackson has agreed to resurrect Kong. How can this be possible? True Andy Serkis did an excellent job as Gollum but we don't want Kong to get carried away with to much pathos and overdo the sentimental interplay with the heroine Ann Darrow. Cooper and Schoedsack kept a tight rein for the time allocated in 1933 and there was more action than amorous by- play. I sincerely pray that Jackson and indeed Serkis whom i admire anyway as a capable character actor, can do the same as 72 years ago and not only thrill the audience but keep over-sentimentality and excess humor out of the equation and pay homage to Willis "Obie" O'Brien's work.Fingers crossed but i have my doubts!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize that in the 72 years it's been since this movie was filmed special effects have come a long way. When I watched "Jurassic Park" the effects blew me away and, of course the "Star Wars" films changed what we watch forever, but even considering when it was made - this movie is absolutely one of the greatest monster/action flicks of all time. It may even be the best. Your kids are going to shake their heads and say "how fake" when they see the mighty Kong, but to me, I still get thrills watching our King fight a dinosaur, and I still feel sadness at the end. I may have seen this movie 100 times and I will forever love it! The 2005 version will soon be out and I am sure it will be a great deal better than that slop remake of 1976, but will we forget the original? I hope not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This classic monster movie has been one of my pleasures for a long time. This 1933 has as of yet not been matched by any remake or sequel until 2005.I am afraid that this movie might be forgotten once Jacksons' vehicle enters the cinema. Which is a shame this movie's accomplicements have stood up to the teeth of time. Yet the Ape and dinosaurs look kind of dated but yet more alive then any modern remake has accompliced so far. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and my jaw hit the floor. I've have been in love with Kong since then but I've not seen the new one yet. But i fear that when it's success the Ancient Kong shall be forgotten. So I hope that Mr. Jackson will point out that there's only one Kong and that's the 1933 version. Better yet, release a cleaned up print with every possible extra that can be assembled.I hope that old Kong does survive the storm this autumn. And not just lives on in the mind of us oldies.</fullReview>

The prehistorical period is set on a remote island where the indigenous people work in harmony with nature, which as a result has preserved the prehistoric creatures, which have otherwise been destroyed by man's striving for a world which works against the natural environment and destroys all in its path. Is it any wonder that Kong was so angry when he got to the civilised world?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Kong' will always persist as one of the greatest, if not the greatest film made, even as filmdom may evolve over hundreds of years. A story of romance combined with the ultimate earthly adventure, a science fiction mystery, and insight into the symbolism of the human psyche all combined magnificently to create a landmark standard for decades and more. Almost impossible to believe it was made in 1933, almost immediately after the introduction of sound into films. And what sounds effects! Pay attention to that Tyrannusaurus Rex during the combat with Kong. Like the petrifying sound of large cats confronting their prey. Phenomenal replication of dinosaurs as known at the time with those astonishing behavioral/ body movements combined for one of the greatest suspense thrillers. It's written that the execs at RKO, having watched a promo preview of the battle between Kong and the T-Rex in an effort to sell the film, they were "stunned at the results, having never seen anything like it." This is 2005, and I must add that, despite hundreds of movies since, I've never seen anything quite like it. And the sounds effects combined to make this. And that telltale hint of stop action during scenes merely works to add to the overall sinister mood, those haunting qualities that only the original 'King Kong' conveys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my all time favorite picture. In my own small opinion, they don't get any better than this. Sure, the effects are somewhat crude by today's glossy, slick, CGI standards, but they have far more character and personality. The signature style of Willis O'Brien's individual work is present in every frame of animation. And Max Steiner composed a score that melds with the action on screen in a way few films of that time could achieve. The acting and script for the movie was also far more naturalistic than most of it's contemporaries. The characters all come across as, at the very least, believable. I've heard criticisms of Robert Armstrong's performance as Carl Denham as being too hammy, but when you consider his personality, a flamboyant Hollywood film-maker with a flair for the dramatic, the dialog seems to fit in quite well.The story also never drags or gets dull, except maybe to those who can only sit through mindless summer action films. They also don't move the story at a pace so fast that it leads to giant plot holes or missed information. Overall, a great film, and a must-see for any film buff who hasn't yet seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you know, there is a seventies version of King Kong. However, I have always opted for the 1933 version for my children, friends, and others. I have never believed in sequels. The original King Kong needs no sequel. My class wants to review the '76 version to see any differences, so I will probably make it a class project. I understand yet a third version will be produced. My own feelings is to let the '33 version carry the movie forever and ever. I will keep an open mind on the sequels, though, to monitor the extra-curricular class that I will design so that my students can learn how to be sensitive to nuances when a classic is remade. I write children's books, too, and am including a passage about King Kong in one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today, kids who are 3 years old can watch this without a problem. However, during the time of its release in 1933, many parents felt as though it was too scary for their 10 year old kids to see. This still is a classic horror movie, but the problem is, a lot of the animation isn't very good. At least the animation is better than the original Godzilla movies.This was a breakthrough movie for back in 1933, and it is shown many times on AMC. It still is exciting and thrilling, but it seems a bit dated. However, you have to give it some credit for being able to thrill audiences for over 70 years.This is worth watching, and there was a remake of this movie in the '70's. There is also a remake coming soon from Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson. This is a classic and I highly recommend it, but unfortunately your kids who want to see something scary will probably get bored by it.</fullReview>

A story of unrequited love, King Kong is felled by the beauty of Fay Wray(Ann Darrow). Only the daring skill of Bruce Cabot(Jack Dricoll), can foil Kong's plans to capture and retain her charms ! Terrific stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien , and a top notch score by Max Steiner, give this film an deeper dimension, in what could have been an ordinary film. Outstanding camera work, takes you into the movie , see it on the BIG screen, and you will never forget it !Younger audiences may need the test of time to appreciate it, because of the newer techniques and sophistication of movie evolution, but give it a chance .Universal studios had one of the original 18" stop motion models of King Kong, but they don't always keep him on display, like they should !

Surely somebody more credible like Matt Damon or even Christian Bale would have proved more than a worthy adversary for Kong. And Jack Black as impresario Denham?- worth a try considering the original star Robert Armstrong's character was so deluded in providing the 8th wonder of the world! Let's hope Black doesn't spoil the fun by too many wise cracks. Homage should be paid in detail to the original classic-bring on the dinosaurs,the rampage of Kong against the village, the destruction of New York and the demise of the beast.

		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers. To put it simply this film is at least 30 years before its time. The quality of Max Steiner's score and Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation have rarely been surpassed and all other famous giant monster movies (such as the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, Godzilla, the King of the Monsters and Jurassic Park) all owe a huge debt of gratitude to Kong. It is also interesting to note the similarities between Kong and the Frankenstein monster (who first came to the screen two years earlier.) Both are hideous in appearence but inside are really just lonely and only commit acts of violence when angered. This human facet in Kong's character makes him much more than some rampaging dinosaur/big ape/mutated blob etc etc. The only real bad points in the film are that it takes a really long time in getting around to actually seeing Kong and the film's treatment of the black natives on Skull Island is quite rascist. But overall this is definitely the grand-daddy of all giant monster movies and a genre landmark that has stood the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I start off by saying that this is a great movie, and what I am about to write is not meant to demean it. It should be kept in mind, however,that people, when exposed to new ideas, sometimes take time to get used to them. "King Kong" was made at a time when Black entertainers, athletes, writers, and many others were just gaining acceptance by white audiences. While some whites had no trouble accepting the new situation,most did, as did Blacks adjusting to their new acceptance. "King Kong" seems to have some allegorical elements relating to both. Many whites had a similar attitude to the audience at Kong's Broadway debut, seeing the ape (symbolizing the suddenly famous, accepted Black),as a grinning,mindless, circus performer, while many Black's responded by having white lovers or spouses, thus displaying their new equality (i.e. Kong,s desire for Ann). A popular attitude was that the Black was talented and intelligent enough to be exploited, but "not ready" ("It was...beauty that killed the beast"). The movie in itself not racist, but displays one of the milestones on the way to equality. (We had, and still have, a long way to go) No, I didn't miss the exotic locations and special effects too numerous to count, I just wanted to show an aspect of this film that has all too often been overlooked</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has ever seen KING KONG, whether once or ten or thirty times should be able to see that those involved in the project put their all into it. Willis O' Brien, perfectionest that he was, scrapped weeks of hard work on the T-Rex scene simply because he thought it would look more true to life if the dinosaur scratched it's left ear rather than it's right ear. Other examples-Kong's fur bristling in the wind during his New York City rampage-indicates the kind of attention to detail that sets this film apart from others of its kind.Needless to say, KING KONG was a trendsetter among monster movies of its time. Famous stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen saw KING KONG when he was about nine or ten and has never been the same.(I had the pleasure of meeting him a few years ago at a monster convention-I said to him "You are a worthy successor to Willis O' Brien." Few if any would disagree with that statement.)As a Godzilla fan myself, I would have to humbly admit that the Big G owes his very existence to Kong, the original King of the Monsters.Finally, if there are any movie fans out there who have yet to see KING KONG-and I mean the original, not the 1976 DeLaurentis bomb nor its even crappier sequel KING KONG LIVES,- be sure to catch this one on tv or video. You'll be glad you did.Rating: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

I had heard years before that in Africa King Kong was their most favorite movie and was watched Every Saturday night for years. I know I liked it but if they like it It must be good!! Try it you will like it. As good as Tarzan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big guy goes ape over blonde cutie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the attempts to recreate this movie, the 1933 version remains the consummate "Kong." The photography and FX are superceded by modern techniques, but this movie captures the horror that the producers wanted audiences to feel. It also captures sympathy for the "damsel in distress" totally missed in the remake (1976?). Fay Wray has a knack of showing her horror and revulsion for the big guy. This keeps our attention on the subject.What is interesting about the movie is the amount of material cut by the censors. By today's standards, these were minor issues, but the great thing about the movie is that, even with those shots removed, the film still stands out as the classic that is the gold standard of big monster movies.Can't wait for this to come out on DVD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the One. It's about this giant ape, see... Oh, everybodyknows what it's about by now. The main thing to remember is,Kong's a seminal masterpiece, brilliantly made and executed bygenius minds, whose work has cast its long shadow down theyears to such modern classics as Jurassic Park. Few films havebeen as influential, or as lasting. No early talkie holds up half sowell, nor does any 1930s film spellbind the modern viewer the wayKong does. I first saw Kong on its July 1952 reissue (Stanford Theatre, PaloAlto), a surprise smash hit that led directly to Beast from 20,000Fathoms and THEM! in 1953 and '54. Which I also saw. I was 13, and had never seen anything quite like King Kong LOSTCONTINENT (1951) wasn't quite the same. Kong became one ofmy favorite movies, and it still is. King Kong's the best movie of the 1930s, except for GWTW, whichwas released in the last two weeks of that decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest monster movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, my dad and I went to go see King Kong at a theater in Anaheim. It made me only appreciate more just how great of a movie this is, and that's considering I must have seen it at least half a million times before.Of the dinosaur movies that came before and after King Kong, Kong is still the best one. The Lost World (1925) even today has impressive visual effects and is highly entertaining. It's only problems are a poorly written love story and the fact not everyone enjoys silent movies. The Godzilla films, while entertaining, had cheaper special effects and often times the plots were not as good. Jurassic Park (1993), which some consider the best dinosaur movie, has spectacular Special Effects and is very entertaining. But it is slow at times. King Kong, however, is both highly entertaining and, more importantly, is able to tell the film without a wasted scene or dialogue. I felt as if I was in the theater for only half an hour! If only all movies could do that. But no film is made perfect by accident. This film had a top-notch technical cast made up of the best in the world at that time: Production designer Mario Larrnagia, Film Composer Max Steiner, Marcel Delgado, who built the dinosaur models and Willis O'Brien, who animated them.Some have questioned as to why plant-eating herbivores like the Stegosaurus or the Brontosaurus would attack humans. Perhaps, the humans were trespassing into their territory and would you defend your property if someone tried to invade it? Also, how many humans living today have seen a live dinosaur in the wild? Then again, some might say this was done by the producers to provide entertainment and suspense. I can agree with that. But do not criticize King Kong for this. It's an adventure movie, not a documentary. While the film is largely about Kong and the dinosaurs on Skull Island, the rest of the film is able to avoid being overshadowed. While I have seen movies that have better acting, this film's cast isn't too bad. At least they are able to conceive realistic characters. Even Jack Driscoll, the film's hero, gets afraid when he talks to Fay Wray. Some also find it annoying that Fay Wray only screams in the scenes where she is in Kong's presence. Well what would you do instead? Tell Kong in a polite, calm english voice to let you down? King Kong is easily worth 10 stars, a masterpiece that will be enjoyed for countless generations to come. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amidst all that has been said about King Kong over the years no one has really given much consideration to the fact that there must have been more lampoons done of it than any other movie. Most recently there was that episode of South Park with Jennifer Aniston as the choir teacher. Everybody must remember that episode of The Perils of Penelope Pitstop where the Hooded Claw sets a giant gorilla on her and this gorilla carries her to the top of a skyscraper and the Anthill Mob attack in biplanes. Or the scene in Herbie Rides Again where Keenan Wynn dreams about being Kong standing on top of the Empire State while Herbies with wings fly round him. While we're still on Disney, I passed a Disney store once and saw a cartoon in the window showing Kong with Minnie Mouse in his hand. I think the number of parodies really shows Kong's impact on 20th century culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is undeniably a fascinating piece of Americana. It was, for many years, a benchmark for the creature-feature genre. In looking at it today, it clearly does not have the impact it once had. The 1930s soundtrack hisses and pops, the dialogue is laughable, the acting is unimpressive. There is subtle and not-so-subtle racial slander. While the stop-action animation is still impressive, it has a choppy and fuzzy quality that modern eyes cannot help but see. Technology has (again) conquered Kong, but that does not lessen his legend or his place in movie history. I love this movie for what it was, but do not expect to be dazzled like the audiences of 70 years ago.</fullReview>

Imagine the horrors of Skull Island in CGI, or to see a CGI Kong swinging at airplanes from the top of the Empire State Building...Then I shake my head and come back to reality. There is only one "King Kong," and it can only be remade, never equaled. Sure, the story is threadbare, the acting is a little clunky, but this movie has an elemental power and majesty that transcends time. Merian Cooper, way back in 1933, knew something many filmmakers today have forgotten: special effects will never take the place of a good story and good characterization. Kong may gave only been an eighteen-inch-high model, but he became a real person.Long Live the King!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic work of world literature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most great works of world literature can all be traced, I believe to either The Bible or Homer's Odyssey. When closely scrutinized, all classic works contain some sort of quest. That quest can either be for the truth or for a sense of home. The original King Kong, is not only one of the finest fantasy films ever made, but a great piece of literature because it encompasses those two quests. Granted, many of the film's elements have dated. Certainly that is the case with some the hammy, overwrought, stereotyped and even at times wooden performances. In our "enlightened", post Marlon Brando-Actor's Studio, age of acting appreciation I think it is all to eager to lay such a criticism on films from that quaint period known as the 1930's. And even though Kong gives the best performance in the film, the actors do their job and tell a believable and captivating story. Filmmaker Carl Denham's quest for truth and his odyssey is what fantasy films are all about: a journey into a fantastic and strange new world. His desired exploitation of that savage and innocent world is what tragedy is all about. Kong's quest for safety and dominance in his natural habitat makes for a great metaphor for our modern age. So many of us have been uprooted by forces seemingly beyond our control and we all want to find our place back where we came from. Unfortunately that quest often leeds again to tragic results, Kong unlike Dorothy ( a story that obviously greatly influenced the screenwriters of Kong) dies. So much has been already written about this great influential film, nothing I say here will be original or enlightening necessarily. It is just that in this day and age of CGI and garbage like ID4, Armeggedon(sp) and Wild Wild West that is (or at least once was possible) to use special effects to enhance a story as opposed to letting the screen technology engulf any semblance of humanity. A most certain 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By anyone's standards, "King Kong" is the 800 lb Holstein of the monster movie world. "Dracula" may have come first, but "Kong" created a whole sub-genre within the Horror catagory as the first Giant Monster moovie, later to be added to by such illuminaries as "Godzilla", "Beast From 20,000 Fathoms", "It Came From Beneath the Sea", "Jaws", and cowntless udders. The whopping fx by Willis O'Brien were state-of-the-art at the time, and remain as classic examples of monster moovie fx, along with Ray Harryhausen and Rick Baker. As everyone knows, "King Kong" is about beauty and the beast: the beauty in this case is Faye Wray, the lovely blonde goddess whose screams of terror are one of the moost recognizable sounds in film history; The beast is, of course, Kong himself, the Big Fella, the "8th Wonder of the World". The kewl thing is that Kong goes from being a terrifying brute to a sympathetic victim, and a fine metaphore for things in Nature best left undisturbed. Sure, the film is a bit dated, especially some of the chauvanistic and racist attitudes towards women and minorities, but these are merely the reflection of the times. "Kong" still packs a punch - when the MooCow was just a small, innocent calf, he was scared outta his Cheerios by Kong and his gang of stop-motion dinosaurs and assorted monsters. Certain scenes, such as the "Brontasaurus" devouring the slowest of the fleeing sailors, and his high-pitched death wail, would haunt the MooCow's nightmares for decades. Udder scenes, including the subway car/can of sardines scene, and of course the grand finale, live on as some of the greatest scenes on film. The photography is wonderful, the direction flawless, the sets are amazing, the acting capable and typical of it's time, the fx landmark, and the moosic perfect. The MooCow is here to tell ya', "King Kong" is the definitive American Moovie Classic, not that sappy, overblown soap opera "Gone With the Wind". :=8P "Kong" is a timeless classic that should be in every moovie cowlection in the US! If you can, try to get a copy of Ted Turner's original, un-cut version, which shows such edited tidbits as Kong peeling away Faye Wray's clothing (yowza!), and nasty giant spiders gobbling up sailors from the log/bridge. The MooCow says, if yer gonna own just one moovie, "King Kong" just might be the one!! :?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Harryhausen-O'Brien; Steiner's score and Spivak's sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let's correct the comment of one "user" above, that Kong's creator was Ray Harryhausen! Mr. Harryhausen must be stunned to read that. The creator of Kong (as well as the entire "Lost World" [1925]) was the great Willis O'Brien.The more I see Kong the more astonished I am at the SUCCESS of some of those special effects, and the cleverness of them. For example, it took me years to comprehend the two (!) miniature rear projections representing Driscoll (Cabot) and Darrow (Wray) screen right and left while Kong, center, battles that water-lizard-snake thing in his cave. And the blending of the miniature rear projection of Darrow in the giant mechanical hand, almost matching the animated model in front of it, seeming to peel off her clothes (and sniff them!). Endlessly fascinating.And the musical score--derivative it may be, but at least not of other movie soundtracks, since there had been none to speak of. No, Steiner's sources are loftier: Wagner and Strauss, et al., and the whole is put together with dramatic precision and passion.Murray Spivak's inventive, beautifully modulated sound effects are an aural accomplishment that stands alone in movie history, a do-it-yourself, seat-of-the-pants triumph at a time when technical capabilities were rudimentary (parts of the monstrous roars and screeches are Spivak's own voice which he monkeyed with, you should pardon the expression).King Kong is what I call a "pure" film in that it is totally unbelievable, illogical, over-the-top and mesmerizing, like a dream. Pure film carries us along like a dream; it has its own mad logic of imagery and action. King Kong may be the first studio masterpiece of the sound era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Years ago I purchased a copy of Mad Magazine. In it was a parody of King Kong, one of my favorite movies. During the scene where the natives are negotiating for Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), the chief offers Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) a fistful of baseball cards (including, I believe, Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider of the Brooklyn Dodgers). He goes for the deal and you see Ann being carried off to the other side of the big wall. I love lines like "Gee, this'll make a swell shot," "I don't know, I think its a member of the dinosaur family," and Jack Driscoll's "Gee, I think I'm in love with you." I liked that the original footage, left out as too violent, was restored, because it is not superfluous but rather adds to the terror and arbitrariness of nature. It also shows Kong's fixation on Ann and his disregard for the rest of humanity which has only hurt him. This is a movie I could watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong (1933): Dir: Merian C. Cooper / Cast: Fay Wray, Bruce Cabot, Robert Armstrong, Frank Reicher, Noble Johnson: Well made yet overrated monster fest about a filmmaker who travels to remote Skull Island with a crew and a young woman. For reasons unexplained the island is populated by dinosaurs, a tribe and a giant gorilla that they sacrifice young virgins too. Special effects were top notch including Kong's battle with airplanes atop the Empire State Building. Director Merian C. Cooper does a great job at creating this landmark monster film. Fay Wray will always be embedded in our minds as King Kong's one weakness. She plays an actress who agrees to do this film but once they reach the island she is kidnapped for a sacrifice. Bruce Cabot's role is more predictable but he risks much to bring Wray to safety. Robert Armstrong has the pitiful role of ignorant director who risks everyone's lives on an island that is never given any background or explanation. His closing statement about beauty killing the beast is ludicrous since it is his own doing. Noble Johnson plays the native chief and as they go, they desire to sacrifice Wray as fast food to this giant ape. Many people die in the chaos and that is the best he could come up with? Whatever the case this film advanced special effects from prehistoric life to that fatal fall from high above. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

It was probably one of the early movies to start using the green screen to add digital effects which made it a little choppy, however it was necessary to keep the movie interesting and action packed. You have to take into account when the movie was made and what was happening socially. After about 20 minutes after first seeing the monster and taking in account what kind of dialogue was being used throughout the movie, the movie started to come off more and more racist to me. Of course in the early 30's there was still a lot of racism in America, so it's understandable if a movie was made with that kind of vibe to it. Overall, well made movie for the time period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Eighth Wonder of the World"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'King Kong (1933)' is strongly indebted to "The Lost World," particularly Harry O. Hoyt's 1925 adaptation, in which a dinosaur is brought back to civilisation (and for which Willis O'Brien also did the stop-motion effects). Significant in both stories is the clash between primitive man (represented by natives and ape-like creatures) and modern man. 'King Kong' uses the science-fiction trope of the conflict between Man's primal emotions (particularly lust, embodied here by Kong) and his intellect, exemplified by the metropolis of New York City. Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis (1927)' concludes with the realisation that these two human qualities must cooperate to ensure the future of civilisation. 'King Kong' takes a different stance: Kong, the epitome of primal emotion, despite his mammoth size throughout the film, is decidedly dwarfed as he scales the Empire State Building, at the time the pinnacle of human achievement. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) later muses that it was "beauty killed the beast," implying that Kong's animalistic instincts ? namely, his lust for Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) ? had proved his downfall in a modernistic world.</fullReview>

However, I am at least unique in that I saw the film in the theater as well as tonight on Turner Classic Movies. No, I did NOT see it back in 1933 (I'm not THAT old) but when it was re-released in 1971. At the time, I loved the film and thought it brilliant entertainment. So, tonight with my youngest (who is a huge classic horror fan), I watched the film once again and had a ball. I also marveled at the wonderful special effects for 1933. Sure, some of it may look quaint today (especially the stop-motion Kong), but considering that there had been nothing like it before, you can't help but admire it. However, one aspect of the project really stands up superbly today--and is every bit as nice as the newer versions--that's the cinematography. The wonderful scenes in the jungle are marvelous works of black &amp; white art--almost like Ansel Adams' work if he'd used a movie camera. I loved the misty backgrounds, exquisite use of matte paintings and mostly seamless integration of props, people and backgrounds. This truly is one of the most important and ground-breaking films in history and must be seen in its context to be appreciated.By the way, the same year RKO released this film they rushed "Son of Kong" into theaters to cash in on the public's reaction to the first movie. Unfortunately, while it's watchable and clever at the beginning, the film degenerates to a sappy kids' movie later on and is an easy film to skip. Too bad....I wanted to love the sequel as much as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creature feature with a heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong is the original creature flick. Almost 80 years on it's still highly entertaining and iconic; and one of the great films of the 1930's pre-Code era.Perhaps the greatest achievement of King Kong was in the deployment of ground-breaking special effects that not only brought to life fantastical monsters but also, in the case of Kong himself, created a creature that was genuinely sympathetic. The effects are obviously dated but do not get in the way of the entertainment value; quite the opposite in actual fact. The raw special effects give the movie a heart and soul that most recent CGI driven films could never hope to achieve. In any case, Willis O'Brien's stop motion animation is fabulous for the time and you do believe these creatures are alive.Having just seen this movie for the first time in many years one of the things that struck me the most was how explicit it must have been for the time. King Kong was released before the introduction of the Hays Code which dictated to filmmakers many things that were unacceptable. In a couple of scenes on the ship you can clearly see that Fay Wray is not, shall we say, wearing a bra underneath her dress; it may not seem like much to today's audiences but is certainly risqu in comparison to films released in the 40's and 50's. And as for the violence? Well it's pretty uncompromising in places. Kong gets involved in some fairly brutal acts. He rips the Tyrannosaurus's jaws apart, he mercilessly tosses men into the ravine, crushes others underfoot, takes a bite out of various others, trashes the primitive village and, perhaps most shocking of all, throws a poor woman to her death for no reason other that the fact she is not Fay Wray. The Brontosaurus gets in on the act too by eating various unfortunate bystanders. Pretty grisly stuff for 1933!Events slowly build up from scenes in New York to the arrival on Skull Island. Once at our destination, though, the film is non-stop action. The set design for the primitive village complete with giant wall is stunning. And the various monster attacks on Skull Island itself are wonderfully well done and pretty scary for a film this old. Once back in NYC there is no let up as Kong rampages through the Big Apple derailing a train and climbing the Empire State building for the unforgettable iconic climax. There isn't really a lot at fault here but, if I am being picky, the love story between the Captain and Fay Wray's character is unconvincing; although, to be fair, many other films from this period featured love affairs that look hopelessly unrealistic to modern eyes.Much more interesting is Kong himself. He is a fascinating monster. We are clearly expected to sympathise with him at the end - his protection of Fay Wray is quite touching. On the other hand we see him many times committing acts of unnecessary violence. A somewhat complex villain/hero far removed from some of the one dimensional movie monsters that would follow in his wake. King Kong is a monster movie that works equally as a tragedy. And that is surely not an easy trick to pull off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My bond with this picture is 'made out of chrome steel'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This motion picture is by far the greatest picture ever made - that's not just an opinion, that's a fact! Peter Jackson should rot in hell for his atrocious remake. Fancy making Carl Denham a bad guy in his version. Hello! The original's characterization of Denham was based on Cooper himself. But then again, we all know that Peter Jackson thinks of Cooper as rivalry, it's scattered in little hints all through his "movie".But anyway, let's just concentrate on this film. The Special Photographic Effects? God could not have done better, and he made Dinosaurs hundreds of millions of years ago in the first place! These effects were a landmark at the time, and still are. I think that if this movie had been made in modern days just as is, it could have easily won the Oscar for Best Special Effects over all the CGI jargon by far. They're that good.The acting? Superb. People always complain about the acting of that period, but I love it and I wish that today's actors and actresses could act that well. Every single word was filled with emotion, drama and rising tension. And boy, Fay Wray was a stunner. God bless Miss Wray, and her paralyzing and chillingly high-pitched scream! The story? Marvelously clever and intelligently witty. Perfect timing, too. It takes you up on it's wings, and flies straight onto Skull Mountain Island, introduces Kong with a quick professionalism to die for, and we get straight off that island and into New York where we discover the fate of Kong.The entire Motion Picture? It would take years to type all of my emotions for this film. But one thing is for certain, my bond with this picture really is 'made out of chrome steel'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Which Kong was better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many people miss the point - as did Peter Jackson himself - as to one of the main things that makes the original KONG far superior. In the original there is no ridiculous love interest between Anne and the Ape - and THAT IS WHAT MAKES HIM ALL THE MORE TRAGIC A FIGURE! He is Alone....both on Skull Island and there heroically poised atop the Empire State Building. No one gives a damn about him - except we, the viewing audience. Denham saw big bucks, Anne saw horror. Only WE see and feel his grandeur and tragic loneliness. By turning the original into a twisted love story, Jackson's version is actually more akin to the DeLaurentis trash. Apart from missing the point about how Darrow and Kong should have truly interacted, EVERYTHING is overdone in this big turkey of a remake. Come on - 3 T-Rexes instead of the dynamic '33 one-on-one......Anne flying all over the place, bouncing off dinosaur heads and hanging onto their teeth and falling through vines and being clutched in Kong's hand through all this violence and NOT getting whiplash or a bruise????? Climbing the Empire State Building in the winter and not freezing her butt off, or her hands while climbing a steel ladder???? Plus a lousy music score - as a matter-of-fact, the only time the picture enlivened me was when a bit of the original Steiner music was played in the theatre scene. Anyway, I can't wait for the remake of Citizen Kane where the dying Kane takes a CGI trip on Rosebud through his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still contains the boiled-down ingredients for the common, hell-raising blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For its time, King Kong was ambitious, big-time movie-making, the kind of caliber that still gives off a precious quality to it to this day. That it also is something a lot simpler than I remember it being from when I was a kid is not totally surprising, though maybe just on the characterization-front. I saw it so long ago that I only remember some specific things- the natives riling up themselves to give their sacrifice to their 'Kong'; the big ape fighting the T-Rex; the director presenting the '8th wonder of the world' on stage and then Kong breaking out of the chains. Some of those images are indelible in the realm of old-time classic cinema, and I would always recommend this one, particularly to kids who may feel like 'bah, black &amp; white isn't for me', as it contains some of the finest entertainment of the period, if at least in great spurts.If I do see anything though in watching the picture today a little unsettling it's that the director, Merian C. Cooper, is actually setting trends both good and bad for future blockbusters of this kind. The level that the characters- the three main ones being Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), and Ann Darrow (Fay Wray in her most recognizable and flat-out entertaining work)- work on is one that is of the utmost simplicity, so much so that there really isn't anything beyond the most basic, untouchable points. Denham is ambitious, so much so that he will go to any length to get his next picture made, or if not, get fame other ways. Driscoll is hard-headed, the more courageous of the bunch, and doesn't really like women until he meets Ann. But even with Ann, who does exude a little bit of dimension in an otherwise screaming and frightened performance, there isn't much that she can get out of Jack here. In remembering then too about what Peter Jackson's King Kong had with the characters, I realized that- at least in part if not overall- there were some improvements made in terms of dealing with and getting involved with the people on screen on one hand.But, on the other hand, this IS a monster movie, after all, and what would it be without convincing scenes of action, suspense, thrills, and all that wrapped up into the best special effects and animation of the period? It's here, really, that I can sense what attracted Jackson to make his own version of the picture. Though what's interesting to me in having seen both now fairly close in time to one another, is that I really enjoyed and got engrossed in the animation of this film just as much, if not more, than in Jackson's interpretation. In fact, I would say that if there is any case of the style totally trumping substance, it's in the scenes with Kong on the island and then also when he returns with Denham to New York City. The stop-motion is crude, but then that's really what's so fascinating and cool about it, and it actually does work in a kind of spectacular way with the cheaper thrills thrown in. I loved the fights he had with all the creatures, but even in quieter moments- however few- it was just amazing to see the quality of Kong's fur and face move, how much it kind of contorted and went around this way and that, and then of course with the whole body.So in some crucial ways, King Kong is a marvel of action-based movie-making, where the thrills and, I suppose to, the characters are meant to be as simple, direct, and plain as day as possible, but at the same time the technical aspects are meant to dazzle them and make them glad they paid for the ride. While I might be one of the few out there to overall prefer Jackson's much more ambitious epic that takes all the good ideas here and stretches them out, there are some other things though in this film that still make it a landmark on its own. Kong here isn't a creature that might possibly get 'attached' or fall for a human, and is really just there to tear at anything it gets in its way or tries to stop it from having 'his' woman, and in the end he becomes one of cinema's most endurable bad-asses. Worth revisiting if not seen in a while, or if not seen at all worth it to see what does stick. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is an excellent example of how the white man feels it is his right to exploit other creatures. The white man goes to Africa to harass, capture, and enslave a giant ape. He proceeds to bring the giant ape to New York to exploit it but the giant ape escapes, snags a blonde babe he is infatuated with then boogies up the empire state building with the blonde babe who he bails once he reaches the top. Planes proceed to riddle the giant ape with bullets until he swan dives from the top of the empire state building down to the pavement below and dies. White man makes comment that 'It was beauty that killed the beast!'. Maybe if you would have left Kong alone, he wouldn't be laying on a New York street all smashed and dead. Excellent movie for it's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"King Kong" is one of the many adventure/thriller classics that may not effect as much people today, as it did "back then." But, "King Kong" is still good.The special effects were probably remarkable in 1933, and today, some of the dinosaurs look pretty decent. Like other titles such as "Jaws" and "Psycho" it may not be dated, but it still has some decent thrill value and entertains just as well."King Kong" uses some interesting elements. For example, I thought the Natives were a pretty good element to the story.I don't know if it could provide as many shocks now, but it's one of the only classics with a popular re-make. It was also Hitler's favorite movie.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

If it weren't for Kong, there probably wouldn't be the "jurassic classics" such as One Million B.C., Valley of the Dragons etc. It was also an inspiration for all the giant spiders, insects and rhedosauruses as well as Godzilla (Gojira) and the other great monsters in the Toho stable.

		<shortDescription>One of the best ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a diehard Godzilla fan, I also love the original King Kong, one of the best films of all time, not simply one of the best of it's kind.Without being redundant by saying things that are always said about King Kong, I will say that it's incredible the way the film holds up. I recently bought the 1976 version on DVD (I know it sucks but I am a completist and I like seeing guys walk around in giant monster suits) and it's amazing how you can take the same story, and make a true classic on one side, and a complete disaster on the other.Funny how King Kong is now SEVENTY YEARS OLD and it has better looking special effects than today's films! Why? Because it doesn't use "CGI" computer effects. I hate computer effects. They make films look like cartoons, like the recent "Spiderman". "Spiderman" was a great movie, except for the FX, which sucked. They were drawings done by geeks behind their computers. That's artwork, not special effects. "King Kong" has real FX, FX that took albow grease and not coffee to stay awake in front of the computer screen.One funny thing n King Kong though is the reactions sometimes. You gotta think that upon seeing Kong and dinosaurs, the guys would be screaming "holy ***** ***!!" instead of things like "look at that" but of course, you can't say things like that on film in 1933.Many like to point out that if the natives wnated to keep Kong out, why make a gate for him? But I like a scene when the boys see the first dinosaur hunting for Kong. They chuck bombs and knock him out, and when the guys are walking around the body, and one guy points out it's a dinosaur, the other guy says, "dinosaur ay?" OF COURSE IT'S A FREAKING DINOSAUR! What the hell ELSE does it look like to you?? Haha I love that part.The real thing King Kong fans are waiting for is for someone somewhere to find the missing "spider" sequence, which of course happens when Kong flips all the dudes off the log and into the pit or whatever it is. That's the holy grail of all missing scenes anywhere! I just wish they had the nerve to keep it IN the film after it scared people during the preview. So a couple of people got scared....it's classic!I love the subway sequence because I'm a big subway fan, and I love it when Kong destroys the El (there haven't been elevated subways in Manhattan for ages of course). But again, you would think the conductor would be yelling "holy ****!!!@"It's odd how Godzilla rules the monster world while Kong gets almost no respect these days....I also think the Toho film "King Kong Escapes" (1967) where Kong battles Dr. Who and Mecha-Kong is non-stop fun.When King Kong finally gets on an American DVD, they really should beef it up with tons of extras. It's been on video a million times so they better do it right.Word is now there will be a new Kong film starting in a few years, with a completely CGI Kong. In other words, it's gonna suck and look fake. At least there's always the '33 one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the humans; Kong steals show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KING KONG, though it is a 67-year-old movie, is actually not much different from many of today's action blockbusters: it's all spectacle and nothing else. It's an action film with zero effort on the part of the actors (Fay Wray and the others could have used a lot more acting lessons, to put it delicately) and clichd dialogue - basic action staples. But that's okay, because the movie isn't about people; it's about a huge, spectacular, wonderful gorilla. The special effects are astonishing considering they only had puppets to work with. You can just imagine Depression-era audiences watching this, temporarily forgetting their own troubles as they cheered on Kong through his battles with dinosaurs and airplanes - only to finally die in agony at the hands of cowardly machine-gunners. So the next time you watch this, just mentally erase Wray and the other actors from the movie and focus on Kong. It's his show.</fullReview>

They served their purpose, as did Fay Wray-and anyways, its the Big Monkey who is the star here. He deserved an Oscar, or something.As for all these idjits out there who claim this is either about Freud(guys-its a Building.....) or racist(HUH?!)-yer trying too hard.

		<fullReview>Warning: spoilers in this commentRecently, the R'n'B singer Missy Elliott sang in a music video with a lot of Black revivalist lyrics/imagery. It was a good song, and culminated in Missy Elliot climbing a miniature Empire State Building, swatting at aircraft in the same manner as Kong.I would have to agree with her that Kong is an archetype for Black people, more accurately, the desegregated urban Black populace coming into increasing contact with White communities in the inter-war and postwar period.Of course, that theme is only a foundation, on top of which humour, romance, action, and explosive brass instrument music are layered. And the completely apolitical individual (children come to mind) could still enjoy King Kong.However, the politics are disturbing: Kong, while a physical marvel and a noble creature, is incapable of behaving peacefully once he's released from his bondage in the theatre (symbolizing slavery). Quite on the contrary, he embarks on a violent rampage which is high in destructive quality but much too short.Throughout the film, the biggest dramatic tension comes from the precarious position of 'Fay Wray', which goes a long way toward explaining why people like Strom Thurmond got so negative about desegregation in the first place. Any buckwheat, tobacco-slobbering farmer knows his biggest resource isn't his seed, livestock, or International Harvester, but his little old lady.''King Kong' suffers from racist politics and artificial dialogue. It's virtues are humour, Capt. Englehorn, and good fighting sequences. If you want to enjoy it, watch it with your fingers poised over your nostrils, because occasionally, King Kong stinks.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your travel experiences aren't complete until you find a place that's home to a giant monkey who falls in love with you. That's my personal motto, sure, but Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) finds herself in exactly that boat. Eek, boats. I bet she'll never accept a ride from a strange movie producer ever again after her trip to Skull Island. Geez, even the name of the primitive place has to make a girl shudder. Couldn't they call it "Fabulous Island" or "Club Med (Now With Rampaging Apes!)" or something?None of that sinks this excellent monster movie. King Kong was a technical marvel of 1933 special effects. The stop-motion, while incredibly dated, has a compelling charm. The camera tricks that blended F/X and live-action made it the T2 or Matrix of its day. Kong himself has such savage nobility at the end too. When he nosedives off the top of the Empire State Building (he never really thought his "let's go way high" plan through), it's bound to get to you a little bit.Not that all the characters are memorable for the right reasons. Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot are awfully craptastic in this picture, although Cabot is given some lines that not even a motivated Robert De Niro could sell. Armstrong and Cabot stand in for the 2 guys who made the movie, Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack. Maybe Mer and Ernie are this hammy and/or wooden on their typical tropical adventures. Who can say? It's not like the original Scream Queen Fay Wray reminds anyone of Hepburn.But watch it. Watch it often. It's worth your time. King Kong earned plenty of American Film Institute plaudits (making both the '98 and '07 Top 100 lists, not to mention the Top 100 Thrills, Top 25 Music Scores and even the Top 100 Passions). Ah, monkey love. Nothing beats it...unless you're a screaming blonde woman who just wants the big lug to leave her alone. As for Kong, add him to the long list of those who had a Broadway show open and close on the same night.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the "Podcasts" section for our 31-minute King Kong 'cast...and many others.

		<shortDescription>Skull Island Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KING KONG (RKO Radio, 1933), directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, from the idea compiled by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace, ranks one of the true classics from the 1930s, in fact, one of the greatest adventure films of all time. Following the pattern to MGM's TRADER HORN (1931) and TARZAN THE APE MAN (1932), along with RKO's own adaptation to THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (1932) featuring its KING KONG stars, Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong, in support of Joel McCrea, the studio of RKO makes good by outdoing the others as well as itself with the biggest jungle adventure of them all, featuring a giant gorilla listed below the principal players as King Kong, "the Eight Wonder of the World." Before the theme of "Beauty and the Beast" gets underway, the opening title card of an old Arabian proverb fills the screen to what's to be expected: "And the Prophet Said, and Lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty. And it stayed its hand from killing. And from that day, it was as one dead." Fade in begins with a view of a steamer docked outside New York where Charles Weston (Sam Hardy), a theatrical agent, comes on board to meet with Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a motion picture producer who specializes in jungle films of animal life. Because Weston is unable to accommodate a leading lady for his latest production, Denham, with crew about to set sail early next morning, ventures through the streets of New York until finally selecting Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), an out-of-work girl caught stealing an apple from a street vendor (Paul Porcasi). Saving Ann from an arrest, Denham takes her to a coffee shop explaining his reasons, who he is and why she's been selected to appear in his next movie. Regardless of uncertainties ahead, Ann readily accepts his offer. While on board the Venture, Ann meets with the crew consisting of the skipper, Captain Englehorn (Frank Reicher); first mate, John Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), Charlie, the Chinese Cook (Victor Wong), among others. As the steamer arrives to the uncharted Skull Island, Denham and the others soon encounter hostile natives, prehistoric animals, and King Kong, a giant gorilla, before returning to New York where the unexpected occurs, King Kong's escape and rampage throughout the city. Fay Wray's constant screams, Max Steiner's nearly continuous underscoring and Armstrong's immortal closing line have made this film legendary. Regardless of the wide range of movies to their credits, no doubt that it's KING KONG for which Wray and Armstrong are best known. The popularity of KING KONG lead to an immediate sequel, THE SON OF KONG (1933) starring Armstrong; imitators, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (1949) the Japanese made, KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1962); as well as the Saturday morning cartoon, naturally titled "King Kong" (1966) where its premiere episode, bearing no such characters from the original film, included the now famous climax of King Kong's climb atop of the Empire State Building while holding onto the heroine. KING KONG also lead to theatrical reissues over the years before making it to television by the mid 1950s. Due to intense scenes (Kong stepping on a native, throwing woman out of apartment window, etc.) or controversial material (Kong stripping Ann's dress while holding and smelling her), it's the shorter prints that have circulated for decades. The edited material, long thought to be lost, was recovered and restored in the 1970s. Only after Paramount's 1976 updated KING KONG remake did the restored 1933 version finally turn up on television in 1977, home video (1980s), cable TV broadcasts of American Movie Classics (prior to 2001), Turner Network Television (1990s in colorized prints), Turner Classic Movies (after 1994), and finally DVD. Opening and closing overture music was inserted and shown on TCM in that fashion beginning in 2005, the same year of the latest KING KONG (Universal) remake. Only the now sort after "spider pit" sequence, enacted in the 2005 film, remains among the missing from the original. In spite of better production values, added color and realistic presentation of Kong depicted in the remakes, it's the black and white version of still animations, rear projection sequences and cardboard background settings for the New York City climax that continues to make a lasting impression. A lot of effort certainly went into this production, as depicted in one of the well-constructed documentaries, "Hollywood, the Golden Years" (1987) narrated by Ed Asner. Regardless of certain flaws found in KING KONG, they're easily overlooked due to its fast-paced action, which never stops once the film gets underway. Those who refuse involve themselves with this edition of KING KONG because of its age or lack of color or star names may want to get an idea of its concept by taking a look at the more faithful 2005 remake than the 1976 presentation.

		<shortDescription>King Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the time period in which this movie was written the storyline and how it was played out was rather impressive. Taking into consideration the little technology that was available to the writers, the movie really came together and stuck with its storyline. Taking a look at a movie that was made so long ago really put into perspective the differences that movies made today have. Not only was the movie in black and white and the people dressed in long coats and top hats, it was evident through the animation of the gorilla that this movie was made a long time ago. Although the music was clearly from the 30's, it fit very well into what was going on in that given scene. For instance the scene in which the train was trying to stop itself before reaching the gorilla, the screeching of the brakes couldn't have been more realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not so bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everone at some point has herd of King Kong. The 1933 American Monster film version of King Kong is the original. The films overall tone is dark. The light in most scenes is dim. A notice a few small glitches in the film but nothing too bad. In the beginning of the film view are wondering where are the actors going. Soon viewers find out that Carol Denham is a film director who works in the film industry and wants to make the best film anymore has seen. In this pursuit he finds a beautiful lead actress and him and the cast travel to film the movie on a far away tropical island. An island that is full of beautiful surrounding, creatures, and tribal people. While present on the island the beautiful actress Ann attracts this giant creature. I would say the giant gorilla looks corny and look extremely fake. No one in their right mind would ever believe that was real money but in the film he really looks like a giant so it doesn't spoiled the film too much. When the cast meet Kong for the first time they see his strength and the destruction he can cause but still the greedy film make bring him back to American so he can make a profit off Kong. Overall the film not a bad film has Good acting and interesting plot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film for its's time..however not so much for this time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong's scenes leave me speechless. I can't say I liked it or disliked it. The first chase when they were going after Kong for Ann was a great scene and allowed for the audience feel the fear that anyone would have felt in their position. Compared to nowadays chase scenes there is more hiding and involved and it's nice to see come tripping in fear when running for a change. On the other hand the monster and creatures looked like they were made out of clay which just felt fake and kind of weird. The editing was impressive to show the movements of the monsters matching up with the people's, but it just didn't do it for me. The scene with the T-Rex and King Kong felt kind of too planned out...a gorilla wouldn't have known to go for the legs...like come on. The same goes for when he escapes from the theater an ape wouldn't have known to go unlock his legs. Also the lack of focus on many of the shots was a bad aspect because it didn't give the audience the ability to feel like they are in the scene (jungle or the city) and embrace the atmosphere set up for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>anomalies &amp; goofs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several unanswered "goofs" in the film/story, the first being why the owner/captain of a decrepit tramp steamer would take the word of a total stranger, who hethought was half- crazy, to journey to an uncharted island in the distant south seas to take on an unknown cargo (unless, of course he was desperate for the money). Once on the island, The big wall(re-used set from on older film) has a huge door at center, big enough for Kong to walk through when open (which is how they carry him out,I guess). If those villagers wanted to protect themselves, why a Kong-size door? Next, Kong was roughly half the size of the entire boat, how did they get him aboard, and in all the on-board scenes, he's nowhere to be seen? And lastly, in the New York street, we see the train approaching full-speed, but in the quick shot from the driver's cab we see the track take a sharp 90-degree left turn in almost the exact spot where Kong is standing. Only when the driver ses Kong and applies the brake, does the train begin to slow down at all, too late to avoid running off the track, even if Kong wasn't there!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Milestone in Film Making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year 1933, audiences were given a film unlike anything the world had ever seen before. Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack introduced moviegoers to KING KONG, the Eighth Wonder of the World. The film tells the tale of film crew on a ship that sets out to make a film on an uncharted island in the middle of nowhere. They arrive there, and when the lead actress is kidnapped by a giant gorilla, the rest of the crew has to go out and save her. The island is inhabited by dinosaurs, giant bugs, and a giant gorilla known as Kong. This film has a great story, and the acting is good, but the thing that had audiences captivated was the special effects. Willis O'Brien created the stop-motion armitures and puppets that brought Kong to life. Kong is a great character, and you grow to love him, despite his temperament. This movie brought the special effects industry to where it is now, and it inspires many great filmmakers. KING KONG is a classic monster movie, and when you watch it, you know that it is something truly legendary.</fullReview>

But in the middle of the wall is a huge DOOR, if, when opened, Kong could easily walk right through! Next, Kong, the monkey was bigger than the boat! How did they transport him back? Gotta love it, even if it's incredibly inspid and stupid in its premise! And when will will we see the restored (!) version where Kong scratches Fay Wray's pussy then smells his finger?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chang as a fantastical nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of this writing, I still haven't watched Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005), although I own it and plan to watch it soon. In preparation for that I wanted to watch the original again. I've seen it a number of times over the years, and always loved it. Since my previous viewing, which was a number of years ago, I have finally watched writers/directors/producers Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack's excellent travelogue documentary films--Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life (1925), where they followed the Bakhtiari, a nomadic tribe in Iran, and Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness (1927), where they lived among natives deep in the jungles of Thailand (then Siam).So what struck me most strongly on this viewing of King Kong was how autobiographical it was. This is really just a clever self-referential fantasy, with Cooper and Schoedsack jointly represented by the character Carl Denham, played by Robert Armstrong. In King Kong, Denham is an infamous documentary filmmaker known for taking risks to achieve his renowned movies of far-off, exotic places. His reputation is such that although he wants a female star for his new film, no agent in New York City will subject one of their clients to the imagined hardships and insanity of a Denham sojourn. There is a lot of truth behind this set up. Cooper and Schoedsack had a difficult time getting to the locations for Grass and Chang, and had a lot of misadventures and mishaps while trying to film them. Listening to the Rudy Behlmer commentaries for Grass and Chang, including his interviews with Cooper, is as fascinating as watching the films.So Denham, on a tight deadline--he must set sail in the morning, ventures out to find a woman on his own. He goes for someone vulnerable and desperate but beautiful--a woman who is so down on her luck she is tempted to (and probably sometimes does) steal food to eat, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray). Denham and crew set off to a maybe mythical island deep into an unfamiliar ocean, supposed home of Kong, who to them, at that point, is only an ambiguous God-like figure. Of course, things don't go so smoothly once they actually find the island and discover Kong and the other animals living with him. It's easy to see how this fantasy could have arisen in the minds of Cooper and Schoedsack. It's informative that they had very surprising and dangerous run-ins with wild animals in Thailand while filming Chang. Familiarity with Cooper and Schoedsack's documentaries and the stories behind them will lend a much deeper resonance to King Kong for many viewers, because it no longer feels like a purely fantastical adventure, but just a slight exaggeration from reality. I had forgotten a number of effective qualities of the film. The beginning, and various parts afterward, are far wittier than I remembered. The horrific material is also far more visceral and graphic than I remembered--a lot of this stuff is relatively shocking for 1933, as is the amount of skin that the very alluring Wray shows, either bare or barely covered by fairly transparent garments. Of course the stop-motion animation is a treat, and King Kong is also important because it was so influential, even if this isn't the first film to feature stop-motion (that came nearly 35 years earlier), or even Willis H. O'Brien's first film to feature stop-motion. This, along with a couple other O'Brien films, like The Lost World (1925), is the one that was burned into everyone's brains, even leading to entire genres, such as 1950s American monster sci-fi, the Japanese kaiju films like the Godzilla series, and the Sinbad-styled adventure films, although the influence has popped up in many other places, too.This is not to say that King Kong is only worthwhile because of its historical importance or because of interesting historical facts about it. This is a well-told, well-acted, tightly plotted adventure story with, in context, a surprising, disturbing and highly effective brutality, both in the actions of the monsters and towards the monsters. The latter has a lot of poignancy (perhaps much of it unintentional) in depicting our often-questionable relationship with other animals. Also, if you're not used to it, the stop motion may take some force of imagination to read convincingly, but in any event, there's a superb artistry in the special effects work that's worth studying on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Kong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You won't believe how long I've waited and how hard I've searched to find this movie. For the longest time my local Blockbuster didn't have it, and I couldn't locate it elsewhere either, until I stumbled upon a copy of it the other week.The acting in this movie is nothing short of superb. The remake had a big-name cast that, despite itself, didn't do all that much in terms of acting. Each character in the 1933 original, though, is outstanding in their role.Robert Armstrong plays the director Carl Denam very seriously and very dramatically (unlike the more comic performance of Jack Black in the 2005 remake), and much better suits the role. Denam is a serious character, and required a serious performance to live up to the role's potential.Fay Wray, as Ann Darrow, is pleasant and endearing. She's looks the part of the sweet naive girl she plays, and for the first half performs her role brilliantly. The latter half, though, is another matter. She degrades into almost no dialog save from senseless screaming and flailing about, although this is more likely a writing problem. Bruce Cabot does an excellent job as Jack Driscoll. Although the romance between he and Wray's character is awkward at best, he manages to show himself as a caring and endearing character, and helps to pull of the romance between them.The direction of the film is uneven, to the point where it seems more like the film was divided into two halves and directed by two very different people. The beginning is short and choppy, and comes across as almost amateurish. There's absolutely no transitioning from scene to scene, and very little is done in the way of giving it substance. When they arrive on the island, however, the direction takes a much different turn. It becomes very lyrical, very stretched. It adds substance and thickness, easing its way through the events and taking in as much of the island and the action as it can. The latter half is by far the best, and the beginning could have benefited from a like style. However, all of those really wide shots got annoying after a while, and gave the impression that something was being compensated for.The special effects in its day, I'm sure, was state of the art. It appears to be mechanical (or maybe stop-animation), and far above a man in a monkeys suit. However, by today's standards its entirely laughable, and in no way believable in terms of special effects. Kong is constantly jerking about uncomfortably or lagging like a bad computer, and the face has a comical expression soldered on no matter if its in love or enraged. The same can be said about the other creatures (the dinosaurs especially). The Pterodactyl was especially ridiculous looking. However, the direction of the film is so great, the magic of the story-telling so compelling, that after a short time you forget about the extremely dated and unconvincing special-effects, because the story itself convinces you, commands you to believe, its reality. And you do.The action sequences sometimes felt unnecessary. The rescue party's trek through the jungle-wilderness is the biggest case of this. You watch, and just wait for them to die off, because they seemed marked from the beginning to do so. The islanders never gave the impression of being dangerous, even when the kidnapped Ann or summoned Kong. They were victims of both the crew and the ape, and are even described as cowards who flee into their huts at the sound of gunfire. They were used as a plot device, and later discarded for Kong food. A lot more could have been done with them, a lot more.Regardless, the T-Rex wrestling scene is classic and engaging even by today's standards, and Kong's running about New York was just as riveting. However, the scene with him free in the city was disappointing. They had a great chance for an excellent action sequence, even with their limited abilities, but wasted the opportunity and seemingly made it as brief as possible. And that one scene where they suggest using planes to Kill him is needless. That could have been deleted and we would have realized what they were trying the moment that we saw the planes taking off. Despite it's flaws, though, it still stands as a classic and worthy sequence in cinema.In the end, this is a classic movie, and deservedly so. While it suffers by a few contrived scenes that could have been much improved upon, and special effects that are by all means severely dated, it is still an excellent film and a standard to live up to. This is not the tragic tale of mutual yet fatal love Peter Jackson made it. This is, instead, a tale of unrequited love by a creature who did not belong to our modern world. This isn't necessarily better or worse, just different (although I honestly prefer it Jackson's way). This movie has stood the tests of time despite a greatly changed and advanced state of movie-making technology, and for a fantasy/adventure film this is no easy feet. This is a definite must-see for fans of classic films and for anybody who enjoyed Peter Jackson's 2005 remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one that started it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that started the King Kong phenomenon, spawning sequels, remakes and imitators. The first time I saw this I was a small kid and at the time BBC2 was running a series of monster movies on Thursday evenings. This was the movie that got myself and I'm sure so many others into monster movies. For it's time the special effects were groundbreaking and the gorilla itself is very well realised. The story is a classic and the ending on top of the Empire State building still brings a tear to the eye even after all these years. One thing I've often thought rather odd is when the beast is chained up in the theatre and starts getting mad, the audience is told not to worry the chains are made of chrome steel. That's all well and good but what about the wooden framework he is chained to? What with Kong having the strength he has, surely he could snap those planks like matchsticks? Still this is a small point and not a criticism.Anyone who hasn't seen this yet should see it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In New York City, filmmaker Carl Denhem ( Robert Armstrong)is going to film his latest motion picture on a island with a crew especially his friend Jack Driscoll ( Bruce Cabot) and needs a perfect female to play the girl for his movie. He finds a beautiful blonde woman named Ann Darrow ( Fay Wray) as she agrees to be in his movie, the next day as they set sail to the mysterious Skull Island as she has been chosen as a sacrifice for the gigantic gorilla known as Kong whom the natives worship kidnaps her as it takes her around the island. Carl with Jack and the crew must rescue her from the clutches of Kong even if it has to fight some still existing dinosaurs till they will finally capture Kong for Broadway but unfortunately it causes a big panic in the city.One of the all time greatest movies ever and one of the greatest fantasy movies ever! this movie was an original idea conceived by Edgar Wallace and Merian C.Cooper (co-director) then was brought by RKO Pictures and became one of the most successful movies of the 30's with critical acclaim and crowd pleasing. The movie set the new standard in special effects with it's dazzling stop motion effects which hold up in these CGI days and unforgettable moments like the climax and the battle between Kong and the T-Rex, this movie paved the way for great special effects over the years alongside "Star Wars" to "Jurassic Park". The acting is good and the storyline is original, the 2005 remake was very good but this is still a masterpiece of fantasy cinema.</fullReview>

It is a great movie and anyone could watch it. I would recommend you have a family night and watch king Kong 1933 with your children. (not the new one... it is not a KIDS movie) I would give it 9 out of 10 because it would've been a sure-fire 10 if it were in color. I must point out that children under 5 should not watch this... those kids are scared by anything. I loved it and you will to. the new modern King Kong... well, nobody should watch that film under the age of 10. it has brief nudity, language, violence, frightening scenes, disturbing images, and a scene of sensuality. thank you for reading my comment. and have fun watching this fun family movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Movie:Classic: Kong Is Still King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1933, at the height of the Depression, King Kong dazzled audiences who wished to escape the overall gloom in America and journey with director/captain Carl Denham (Bruce Armstrong), the beautiful Anne Darrow (Fay Wray) and dashing sailor Jack Driscoll into a mysterious island surrounded in mist. Everything about this film is terrific. The sound, restored on DVD, is a theatrical experience in itself. Claymation/special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen (of Jason and the Argonauts/Clash of the Titans fame) creates a masterpiece in King Kong and the various dinosaurs on Skull Island. This is Harryhausen's earliest work and he is all set to make it big in the movies. The script is a bit cheesy at times, as if this film is a parody of adventure novels. Fay Wray was cinema's first scream queen and although she is every bit the vapid heroine, she is doing a superb job and in truth, she took her role seriously for she was willing to be in states of semi-undress and even bruises. There's lots to admire about this film. Other than the obvious Beauty and the Beast theme, we are treated to a social statement on greed and fool-hardiness of Hollywood directors, a bold slap in the face considering movies had only recently transitioned from silence to sound/talkies. King Kong is transformed throughout the film. To the natives of the island, he is a fearsome god who demands virgin sacrifices to be appeased. At first, he is Anne's abductor but later on he fights monsters and dinosaurs and becomes her protector. He now sees her as his "bride". In the island, he is the king of the jungle, unbeatable, in his element. But he is no match for the power of man and his technology. When Carl Denham gases him to sleep, Kong experiences powerlessness for the first time in his life. However, one can say he has already experienced a form of softness when he falls for Anne. In New York City, he feels that he needs to protect Anne from wolf-like paparazzi. When he is on top of the Empire State Building (a classic scene of American cinema) and airplanes are firing at him, he finally feels defeated. This is Anne's world, not his world, and he is not king here. So, in fact, it really was Beauty who killed the Beast. This is probably the most feel-good adventure film of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greatest movie of all-time! Robert Armstrong is making a movie and hires Fay Wray to be his star. They sail to an island off the coast of Africa where evolution has gone awry. Dinosaurs roam, and a gigantic ape rules over all. The natives have built a wall to contain King Kong. They capture Fay Wray and offer her as a sacrifice. Armstrong and his crew rescue her and transport Kong to Manhattan's Great White Way as a headliner. Kong breaks loose and terrorizes yet another island. He ascends the Empire State Building with Fay with whom he is smitten and is riddled with bullets from airplanes. He falls to his death. King Kong is a film which reaches into modern consciousness. It shows man clashing with nature of which he is a part. There are interracial overtones. Armstrong declares, "It was beauty killed the beast." Wray had to live with this film and finally accepted it as a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see King Kong because I have just read a book on researching real gorillas. Of course, King Kong is a fantasy film, but in any case I was curious to see if Kong behaves somehow similarly to real gorillas - and I noticed his breast-pounding!As a story, King Kong is an interesting version of "Beauty and the Beast" to which there are quite a lot of references in the discussions of the characters. However, the contrast between Ann and Kong is almost too big: think about if a man really could hold his sweetheart in his hand! And Ann was screaming too much, although Kong was indeed a bit frightening because he was so huge.I rather pitied Kong when he was in chains and thousands of people came to stare at him. But it was incredible how he could cause such destruction in New York.In fact I realised only in the Empire State Building scene that Kong was in love with Ann, for he protected her not to fall down when the planes were flying right above them, and when he himself couldn't avoid his fate any longer he first made sure that Ann was safe. However, I think it was quite tactless for Denham to say at the end that "it was Beauty who killed the Beast".At least I will remember all my life how Empire State Building looks, although I would never have the possibility to go to see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is not a great film, but a good one. It has great scenes that have stood the test of time, and may very well remain part of the collective consciousness for a long time. It suffers from a weak sense of adventure and weak acting, but at the end of the film, King Kong, (and his creator Ray Harryhausen), are the stars of this picture. Ray Harryhausen injects real feeling and character into the giant gorilla, making him the best actor in the film, and one of the more believable characters ever to be seen on the screen. I personally think that this movie should have been more about King Kong destroying New York, as that scene, while incredible, seems short in comparison to what seems like the very tedious scenes in which King Kong battles dinosaurs on his home island, and leaves me hungry for more.</fullReview>

I've seen comments alluding to Kong as a Christ figure (absurd), and as a metaphor for black slavery (ridiculous). It's simply an enjoyable, well made monster movie. The screaming bit with Fay Wray was definitely overdone as it becomes painfully shrill and cries out for the TV volume to be lowered or muted but, this is merely a small criticism on my part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not To Be Sniffed At...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast" (Carl Denham).After all these decades, it seems obvious that a movie which predominantly relied on visual effects can no longer serve as a supreme entertainment of shock, thrill and wild imagination. Unjust as it may occur to many viewers of in-depth perceptions, KING KONG (1933) is taken seriously primarily thanks to its significant place in the history of the genre. Surely, it cannot stand a chance against today's blockbusters of automatically computerized reality. As film critic James Berardinelli points out: "advances in technology and acting have dated aspects of the production." However, if we take cinematic achievements and development seriously, we cannot ignore the original, its most innovative, creative ideas even though numerous, up-to-date remakes push their ways towards superiority. Why? The reason does not merely lie in the fact that it IS the original with no 'damage' of plagiarism but there is also this 'something' here that modern movies can no longer evoke. With this in mind, I recently went to see 1933 KING KONG on the big screen in my town not expecting to be thrilled by its power of horrid quantity but to be allured by its charm of solid quality. It was an event for me and many viewers who did not listen to the artificial, deceptive dictates suiting the masses: "Too old = too dated." Wine gourmets (and good films are like wine) will get the point along with its irony of 'aging': 'the older = the better!'HAIL CENSORS! It depends on you whether you are ready to accept the matte paintings and various dated images. Even if you love silver screen Hollywood productions, you may as well get bored with this movie. But there is one aspect that holds viewers' attention today. Although the film is significant historically (including its first feature-length musical score specifically for a talkie film by great Max Steiner), KING KONG was also a victim of various cuts imposed by censors growing in power in the early 1930s. How shocked they must have been when they saw Kong removing woman's clothes, touching her body and sniffing his fingers! Moments that pushed the limits of moral acceptability were out of question for them. Their scrupulous censorship did a good thing, however. The deleted scenes now push the limits of viewers' curiosity. People want to see it with these scenes in particular.DATED OR CREATIVE FANTASY? The narrow variety of expectations as for this genre, at the same time, appears to be complicated. For many, the long awaited Kong may occur to be a merely laughable product of its time. The same can be said about other fantasy creatures that appear in the movie, including a giant snake, a flying reptile, a Tyrannosaurus rex (initially there had also been giant spiders that were later deleted by censors). Nevertheless, its atmospheric touches, including the first foggy encounter with the Skull Island and the bizarre depiction of some savage rituals do still impress us. Even film scholars find a strong point on the subject of prehistoric and fantasy creatures. Having stated that KING KONG is a father of many today's monster blockbusters, Roger Ebert, for instance, claims that here you don't look at "more or less a real dinosaur but at 'an idea' of a dinosaur, created by hand by technicians who are working with their imaginations." That imagination is what modern films offer less and less. Reviewer Almar Haflidason, in that significant difference, adds: "technology has moved on but blandness seems to have crept in too." SETS...Both deliberate and coincidental is the fact that the high wall which separates the locals from the beast was originally used as a gigantic set of the Temple of Jerusalem for Cecil B DeMille's KING OF KINGS. Both films share SHOWMANSHIP! King Kong himself resembles the fantasy protagonist with more sympathetic tendencies. No doubt the film is worth seeing today merely for what it was 8 decades ago ? surely a supreme achievement of growing science fiction not to be sniffed at. It was awesome, spectacular, breathtaking, shocking and, above all, NEW. In this respect, critic Roger Ebert nicely observes that the movie "pointed the way toward current era of special effects, science fiction, cataclysmic destruction, and nonstop shocks." But as long as we consider special effects and gigantic monsters, it meets our requirements more or less. What about people in there? Is there any room for human characters? Here, let me again base my thought again on Roger Ebert's who observes: "on good days I consider CITIZEN KANE the seminal film of the sound era, but on bad days it is KING KONG." As a matter of fact, there is no room for any character development, any psychology nor sophistication. We may say that Fay Wray is a blonde star of the movie, the 'scream queen', the beauty which 'kills the beast,' merely an object than a character to be studied. That is, unfortunately, what has always happened when show wins over depth. As a contrast to beauty comes Carl Denham played by Robert Armstrong. He embodies greed, instrumental relations with people around and THAT unleashes the beast of terror within chained King Kong. While Denham is this dominant aspect of man, a little cure appears to be Frank Reicher (Bruce Cabot), the beauty's leading man with gay undertones. What we get in the end is the quintessential conclusion about the victory of beauty rather than humanity (almost on the verge of Dostoyevsky's 'Beauty Will Save the World' memorably studied by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn).If you are not a fan of the genre, KING KONG will be a surprise for you; if you are the buff of such films, it will leave you to think much about what happens in modern cinema. As a gem of the period and genre, KING KONG is a classic you'd better not sniff at whatever your preferences are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the ten greatest films of all-time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Powerful. Exciting. Heartbreaking. Epic. Perfection. All of these words are descriptive of the 1933 film King Kong, which remains to this day as one of the ten greatest films of all-time. A movie of romance and passion, King Kong never fails to be exciting at all-times. Robert Armstrong as Carl Denham delivers one of the greatest performances of acting that I've ever seen, bringing enthusiasm to the screen that few actors have ever achieved. The movie, which opens in New York City in 1933, builds up to a voyage to an uncharted island where the adventure that is King Kong begins. The suspense, action, and drama never ceases throughout the film and is accompanied by one of the greatest music scores of all-time. The music makes up some of the movie's greatness, but make no mistake about it, the true star of the film is the big guy himself. Kong plays the role of a misunderstood giant gorilla who only wants to be with his newly-found gem Ann Darrow. However, fate just won't allow this to happen and what unfolds is one of the most exciting, yet tragic stories of all-time. The visuals in this movie are so famous, so powerful, so moving and will likely never be forgotten. The special effects, truly remarkable for 1933, are even passable by today's standards, which is a testament to how unbelievable they were at the time. King Kong is possibly the most advanced film for its respective time period of all-time. However, what some people fail to grasp is that Kong is far deeper than just an action/adventure/monster movie. It's a movie with a heart, a story which carries with it an emotional theme which rivals that of just about any other. The heartbreaking story of the beast, taken from its kingdom, stripped of its new-found "love" (Ann Darrow), and ultimately exploited in an unfamiliar world is one which never fails to put a lump in your throat by the end of the movie. Despite perhaps portraying the proverbial "bad guy", Kong manages to pull more pathos from viewers than perhaps any other villain on the screen ever was able to do.King Kong perhaps reaches greatness on more levels than just about any other film. It has the romance of Casablanca, the drama and tragedy of Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind, and the action of Star Wars all combined into one incredible story which cumulates atop the Empire State Building with one of the all-time greatest scenes in cinematic history. The final tragic glance that Kong gives to Ann Darrow, the woman he could never attain, truly is, as Time Magazine stated, the greatest special effect of all-time...a fitting ending to a movie of undeniable perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost worlds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, lies a lost island; and cut off even from the inhabited parts of this lost island lies a lost land.This lost land is a wondrous place - everything that the lost worlds Edgar Rice Burroughs would have been if Burroughs had been able to write; perhaps a trifle denser and damper. The special effects are lovely. King Kong himself was the least of them, but even he, for the most part, has real personality.When we step through the giant gates OUT of the lost land, however, things don't look nearly so good. The inhabited peninsular is just ludicrous: white explorers hiding behind pot plants from ooga-booga natives whose outfits probably still have price tags attached. Dialogue is often utilitarian, never brilliant. King Kong is a great myth which has been very well served by some parts of this film, and very poorly served by other parts. Beautiful though the film is, its status as a classic is undeserved. Overall it's a historic milestone rather than an artistic triumph.As for the special effects: don't judge 1930s technology too harshly, but let's not have any false veneration, either. The models are often designed in ignorance of anatomy, movement is jerky and we can sometimes tell when the crew have run into a technological wall. This DOES matter in a fantasy where nine tenths of the effect is atmosphere. (Although lapses in art direction are by far a more serious problem.) Still, stop motion was an art with character and solidity; and the technical problems evident in `King Kong' were eventually solved - just ten years before stop motion was replaced altogether by sterile computer-generated images. `King Kong' shows us a lost world on an island, a giant ape who is lost in more ways than one, and a lost art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've tried with this movie. I've tried and tried, but it's not my cup of tea at all. I can see why audiences were amazed by this movie at the time, but was only 1933 for, oh, roughly a year, and nowadays 'King Kong' is looking pretty musty. It doesn't have that timeless quality that keeps other movies of the same era as fresh today as they ever were, but it does have bad acting, a pace as plodding as Kong himself, scenes that go on far too long and nary a sense of wonder. But it does have some interesting animation and the lovely Fay Wray, who we see a bit more of than she probably intended in the scene where she's being pulled out of the water.It all starts when film director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) sets sail for an uncharted island, see? He got the location from a skipper who fished a man out of the sea and was able to get a bit of information out of him before he died ? this snippet includes a perfectly drawn map showing the exact shape of the island, which isn't bad going for a man at death's door. So, along with starlet Ann Darrow (Wray), sexist sailor Jack (Bruce Cabot) and the ship's large crew, Denham sets off to this island to make a picture, see? When they reach their destination, they find it's inhabited by a tribe who have built a huge wall separating them from the rest of the island, and seem to be sacrificing a woman to whatever god they worship. When they kidnap Ann and set her up on a blind date with their god, we see he's a thirty-foot gorilla ? the dreaded King Kong!This is pretty bizarre stuff, isn't it? Massive monkey terrorises islanders! Oddly, the door in the natives' wall is big enough to let Kong through, which seems to be a bit of a design flaw. But it enables Denham to lure Kong to the beach, and the beast is promptly knocked out and taken to New York, where Denham predicts he'll make big bucks by exhibiting him. But this is a Man Meddles With Nature story, so Kong dutifully busts loose and rampages through the city, looking for Ann. I find it quite strange that this movie has become a so-called 'classic' because apart from a so-what 'Beauty and the Beast' plot line and better production values, there's not much difference between this and something like 'The Land That Time Forgot'. It's cinematic heresy, I know, comparing this to a Doug McClure movie, but the only thing that's missing IS Doug McClure.Just check out Denham's lame reaction when he comes across a stegosaurus: 'Hey, look at that,' he says, amazement etched into his every word, 'it's something from the dinosaur family.' Pin sharp, this guy. 'Dinosaur, eh?' says Jack, equally stunned by the presence of a supposedly long-extinct creature on the island. Not being the most ecologically-minded fellows, they of course shoot the creature dead, making sure to blow its brains out as it lies helplessly on the ground. Good old Denham's a bit of an asshole, really: at the end of the movie, when Kong has been shot down from the Empire State Building, he famously muses, 'Oh no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast.' No mate, it was you gassing him and dragging him off to a city, thereby allowing him to destroy property and kill numerous innocent people. Show some remorse. Yeah?Of course the main talking point of this movie will always be the special effects, since the wooden acting and saggy story are nothing to get excited about. Willis O'Brien's pioneering stop motion animation is impressive, and seeing the joins doesn't stop the integration between the models and the live action being very clever. The Kong-goes-mental scenes must have taken forever to get right, especially the timing when he interacts with the live action foreground. By far the best part of the movie is Kong's New York walkabout, particularly the bit where he rips apart a railway line, causing a derailment. There are two really horrible scenes, one where Kong shakes a log some of the men are holding onto, sending them plummeting into a ravine; and another one where he plucks a woman out of her bed and throws her to the ground.But the acting, pacing and music are so boring! The script seems to have been typed up with no full stops in it, so the actors just blare out their lines in those grating foghorn voices of theirs. The male characters are a bunch of sexist pigs, which makes the film a product of its era, of course, but it's obnoxiously placed front and centre in the early stages and it makes most of the central characters look like idiots.On and on it goes. The stuff on the boat getting to the island takes a long time. The hunt for Kong through the jungle takes a long time. Then Kong has a fight with a dinosaur, which takes a long time, and then he duffs up a giant snake, which also takes a long time. Oh, and then he fights a pterodactyl, which... you get the idea. There's not much variety here, is there? Kong beats up a giant monster, a giant monster and a giant monster. All accompanied by the soupy score, which produced that dreary ache in the back of my head that tells me I'm not having a good time. If this was shorter, less boring, less misogynistic, had better dialogue and acting, a different score and wasn't so repetitious, then I could probably begin to see why some people regard it as a great movie. It's no classic to me, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely a story I wasn't expecting, but it was good nonetheless. The theme of the movie was based on love and beauty. The beast, King Kong, was so attracted to the leading lady that he didn't want to be away from her. He also felt protective of her as well. That is how the beast came to his death, because he couldn't let her go. It's like Denham said, "The planes didn't kill the beast, beauty did."Besides of a good story, there were certain aspects in the movie that weren't so good. The actions scenes in the movie with King Kong and the other different animals were kind of corny and hard to believe, but I know it's because the technology of movies wasn't as sophisticated as it is today. Also, the sounds on screen and off screen were good for a while, but got very repetitive as the movie went on. Some of the scenes in the movie were a little far-fetched, like the killing of the animals and how the animals attacked the people, but it worked for the movie. Overall, the story was good, the directing and acting were wonderful as well, but the cinematography and the picture of the movie was alright, but I know it's only because technology was limited in 1933.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not flawless, but 75 years after its original release, it is still effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I write this, it has been 75 years since the original release of "King Kong" (apparently, its 75th anniversary was just marked earlier this month). It was apparently very successful upon its original release, and some films are forgotten over time, but through the decades since this one first came into theatres, it has continued to receive well-deserved attention. I knew of this early talkie for many years without seeing it, but I have now seen it from start to finish twice, and while it wasn't quite as good the second time, I definitely still found things to like.Carl Denham is a daring filmmaker who is known to shoot his films in dangerous places! Having difficulty trying get an actress for his next project, he searches New York City to find a the right woman for the role. On his search, he soon stumbles across Ann Darrow, a former theatre actress who is currently out of work and broke. He takes her out to eat and offers her a part in the film. So, at 6:00 AM the next day, she sets off with Carl and his film crew on a voyage to the mysterious Skull Island! People live here, but most of the island is cut off from them by a large gate. On the other side of this gate lives a giant gorilla named Kong, who is worshipped by the natives! Late at night, the island's natives abduct Ann and offer her as a sacrifice to Kong, so Carl enters the jungle on the other side of the gate with Jack Driscoll, Ann's new lover, along with several others, to find where Kong has taken her, but in this jungle, many dangerous prehistoric creatures await them!The most significant flaw in this movie I can think of is the script. The dialogue is often pretty poor (mostly early in the film), sometimes even laughable, like in the scene where Jack first falls in love with Ann, telling her how he's scared for her and scared OF her, then says, "Say, I guess I love you." Shortly before that scene, when the crew are on the island for the first time and first meet the natives, Ann acts like a curious little kid. Fay Wray (who plays Ann) was given some pretty cheesy lines for her most famous role. Aside from the script, there is also some dated overacting in the film, some of the action scenes involving Kong stretch a bit, including a fight scene on the island between the giant gorilla and a dinosaur, and the film may be a little dull around the beginning. Sadly, all these things definitely make "King Kong" lose some points.Fortunately, the flaws in the film are outweighed by the merits. One of the film's merits is the special effects. They may look pretty amateurish to today's standards, but I'm sure they were an amazing accomplishment for the time, and must have been stunning to the film's original audience! Remember, this was long before computer animation, and with that in mind, the effects can really be appreciated. This 1933 blockbuster also has some excellent sets and backdrops, including the ones for the jungle scenes. As one would hope for in a movie like this, there's definitely some good action and suspense (even if it's overdone at times). "King Kong" may have some dated elements, but overall, it has aged well. It seems that many still enjoy the film today, and I'm sure that includes many fans of modern action blockbusters!</fullReview>

Not bad, except for a few shaky models, but the transition between live model and animation is really quite well done for it's time. Kong looks alright here in animation (but I could have done without that stupid model head). This movie believe it or not DOES create quite a bit of suspense on the Skull Island chases, though it does get somewhat repetitive (Pick Ann Darrow Up, walk a bit, encounter big monster, put Ann Darrow down, fight monster, repeat) and I liked all the performances here, especially Robert Armstrong as Carl Denham.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion King Kong redefined cinema and how you make movies. The effects were lightyears ahead of the time. They may be cheesy by todays standards but they still work. The story is original and is simple. The movie works in every way aside from the way we connect with Kong. That is where the new movie succeeds and the original fails in my opinion. I was not sad when Kong died because Ann hated Kong and Kong was just ruthless. He killed without remorse unlike the new one in which Ann falls in love with Kong and you can see it. I just feel that the emotional aspect of the original was not there. I never felt that connection the way I felt it in the remake. Anyways it is still an excellent movie (it is pretty graphic though much like the new one so for parents I advise pre-viewing before letting your kids watch it)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Make me Cringe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King King (1933) is a very original movie. It has wonderful special effects for 1933. The breathtaking photography and art direction create a supernatural mood for the film. Willis O'Brien's painstaking animation, without the use of computers, is something to be admired even in 2005. I always enjoy the movie but a few lines always make me cringe. For instance on Skull Island "Blonds are scarce around here." and "We'd like to trade six black women for one white woman." Lines like those, unfortunately, are extremely common in early movies. That's the way things were way back in the days of early movie making. I haven't seen King Kong (2005) but I hope the screen writers are more enlightened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Camp classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "King Kong" from 1933 is a fantasy classic with a lot of trash and camp elements, actually so many that one may wonder how the makers got away with it. If the movie was made today, following the same scene by scene style throughout the story, it would probably be called silly ( including the wooden acting by Fay Wray and others ), but in those days it made a big impact and enjoys the nostalgic feel to it.-----------The build up to the exciting part on Skull island is brilliant and lasts for 40 minutes. We find out how Ann has to steal an apple in order not to starve in New York as an actress, but she is then discovered by an adventure film director Carl. He offers her a role in his next film which is shot on a ship in Pacific Ocean and she accepts. There she falls in love with Jack Driscol ( an entirely unconvincing romance ). The action starts on the island and offers a lot of spectacle and ground breaking fantasy style ( for example, a 2 minute long shot without a cut of a stegosaurus charging towards the crew which shoots him ). The sequence of Kong and tyrannosaur fighting is fantastic and much better than lets say the Dinosaur fight in the silent classic "The Lost World" from 1925. And it's also much more violent, like when Kong breaks tyrannosaur's jaw.One may complain that there are too many monsters present on the island which inevitably results in over the top feel to the story ( like when a Diplodocus attacks the crew from the lake ). Also, the ending in New York is today somewhat schematic looking. Still, it's an excellent, opulent film that works as both sheer adventure and interesting statement about how a love ( Kong/Ann ) between 2 different races or cultures can't work.Grade: 8/10</fullReview>

I've watched the 1978 remake (which I still prefer) around three times and will watch the new one at some point in the next year, but having now gone ahead and watched the original, I'm pleasantly surprised. Obviously, the stop-motion is not as good as it was by the 1960's/1970's in such as 'Jason And The Argonauts', but to be in 2005 saying the film holds up well - and has been re-released to partner the new film - is an achievement. The stegosaurus is too big, as is the pteranodon. The brontosaur is hilarious as both a carnivore and a water-dweller, but I sadly missed the tyrannosaur/Kong fight.</fullReview>

Then he is brought to America in chains to serve the white man, only to break free, kidnap a white woman, and be killed by the military industrial complex.Incidentally, if you look at comic strips of the 30s, Blacks are often drawn as apes or monkeys. I feel that Cooper used this analogy to create a sublimated parable for racial separation. Were the same film to come out today, we'd be all over it, but the character has become such a part of our consciousness that we can no longer see the original racist intent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorilla-monster a big hit on Broadway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original lost world movie. Intrepid wild nature film-maker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) takes ship to explore the mysterious Skull Island somewhere in the South Seas, with a shipload of tough sailors, handsome woman-fearing First Mate Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), and, of course, the love interest, Ann Darrell (Fay Wray). At the island they encounter a woolly-headed tribe of Kong-worshippers, and Kong himself?a gorilla approximately six stories high?takes a shine to Ann. In the chase across the island the party runs into several hungry but awkward dinosaurs, and Kong takes mild delight in dropping a dozen or so of his pursuers down into a chasm. Jack saves Ann while Kong is fighting off the pointiest of his many saurian enemies, a pterodactyl, and Denham's patent gas bombs anesthetize Kong, though not until he has wreaked havoc in the woolly-headed village, biting and pushing and throwing and smooshing down into the mud a good many mostly harmless islanders. On Broadway, just after Denham tells the apprehensive audience not to fear?"His chains are made of Chrome Steel!"?Kong breaks loose, wreaks havoc in the theatre and on the street, bites some people, smashes an elevated train, smooshes some more, captures Ann by reaching through just the right hotel window, and climbs the Empire State Building, where he says goodbye to Ann with a touch of his enormous finger and dies from sixteen thousand bullets from a set of buzzing biplanes. A policeman looks at the body lying on the street and says the airplanes got 'im. No, Denham says, shaking his head sadly. "It was Beauty killed the Beast." Actually, it was Denham's imperialist cinematography, seeking out marketable novelties to sell to the New York audience. Imperialist because he exploits the underdeveloped world?aren't the woolly-headed islanders human? No, they're superstitious "natives," all filled with nonsensical beliefs and dressed in amusing grass skirts, figures of fun. Even when Kong careens through the village, the film-makers show a response shot of a cartoonish middle-aged woman hustling her children to safety, wild-haired, eyes protruding with a comical expression, fat, wearing two large coconut shells as a brassiere. After the expedition leaves Skull Island, we never hear anything about the natives again?they exist to be slaughtered and supplanted as Kong's people by the Americans. Of course, Kong kills white people too, so it's not a race thing, at least not for him. Anyway, the basic idea of the movie is still striking?it must have had a powerful effect on the 1930s audience, even though the production is spotty, the monster models awkward and lumpish, too many sets clearly just painted backdrops, too much wooden acting. Armstrong is a passable Denham, brash and self-confident and careless, and Cabot is a mannequin. Fay Wray, however, is surprisingly good, at least in the first half of the movie when she gets to act out a developing part; in the second half she is only allowed screams and wiggles. Two or three minutes of New York scenes are worth watching, too. Sadly, the movie epitomizes the American myth of Yankee enterprise, the hidden dangers of the uncivilized, and the inevitable progress of (American) civilization. King Kong is one of the most remarkable cases of a movie being really rather awful at the same time that it is very important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong (1933, Dir. Merian C. Cooper &amp; Ernest B. Schoedsack) Carl Denham needs to finish his movie and has the perfect location; Skull Island. But he still needs to find a leading lady. This 'soon-to-be-unfortunate' soul is Ann Darrow. No one knows what they will encounter on this island and why it is so mysterious, but once they reach it, they will soon find out. Living on this hidden island is a giant gorilla and this beast now has Ann is it's grasps. Carl and Ann's new love, Jack Driscoll must travel through the jungle looking for Kong and Ann, whilst avoiding all sorts of creatures and beasts.I saw this out of interest after i saw the remake, and although it did look slightly humorous and had the ability to make you laugh, it was still a wonderful classic adventure. Obviously the look of this film doesn't match up to what we see nowadays, and the actual models did look laughable, but the acting and the story does look well. You really need to enjoy old black and white films, to enjoy this. Even if you don't enjoy them, you should still try and give this a go."I thought you didn't like woman?" - Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) "Yeah, but you're not woman." - Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot)</fullReview>

I absolutely understand in looking at this movie how innovative it was, and how many movies it spurred. It's responsible for an entire genre of film, and that can't be taken lightly. The effects are for sure impressive, and the way they were able to weave Kong into the scenes at a time when they didn't have the benefit of computer animation is amazing. The above is why I gave it a three. If it were on plot alone, I would give it a one. I absolutely detested this movie when it came to characters and the depiction of women. The entire first 20 minutes of the movie was such an insult to women. I understand men viewed women very much this way back in the day, but the fact is that this movie condoned that kind of talk, and I could never dig a movie that spent that much time expounding on the weaknesses of women and how useless they are. The lead female does nothing but scream and wait for the men to save her. In the end, I mostly just wanted Kong to eat everybody and cheered whenever he killed someone which is the opposite of what they wanted. Which is why for me, plot wise, this movie is an absolute failure. I do appreciate the message in there about the ownership men claim over other beasts. At the superiority we feel over them. But I didn't feel like this film was purely anti that stance. The last line also left a foul taste in my mouth. 'Beauty killed the beast'. Because women do everything wrong. All in all, this movie is one I would choose to never ever see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty And The Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In its day, this movie must have been quite a spectacle for viewers. As the main beast, Kong, the gorilla, is physically ferocious and threatening. The film's special effects are very, very good for the 1930s. Stop motion animation, the use of miniatures, and the terrific matte paintings combine to create reasonably realistic prehistoric settings and lifelike monsters. Further, this is one of the first films to use rear screen projection.Of course, the story's underlying premise is ludicrous. But this is a fantasy film. Plausibility is less important than dramatic effect. On the isolated island, Kong is king of all he surveys. But he's lonely. And the beautiful Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) would make a wonderful companion for Kong, however one-sided the relationship.But the film does have some elements that I found unappealing. For one thing, although I can accept some subtle, low-key background music, the ear-piercing sound of a full hundred-piece orchestra not only is distracting, but also is out of place on a remote, prehistoric island.The island natives are mere caricatures. They wear tons of war paint; they carry spears; and they look mean. A little more subtlety in their appearance and in their behavior would have been welcome. And I did not like Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) at all. He comes across as a selfish, egotistical opportunist whose objectives are fame and fortune. He cares not at all about Kong as a living creature.Further, the story is hopelessly dated. Killing wild animals, or transporting them back to civilization for humans to gawk at, is rather heartless. Of course, in those days, wild animals were perceived as threats, not endangered, so the story can be forgiven for its tacky insensitivity to environmentalism.As an adventure fantasy for kids, "King Kong" is a fine movie. The special effects are wonderful. And Kong, despite his ferociousness, is a beast that the viewer can care about. The best way to view this film is to not question the plot, but rather to enjoy the fantasy, and to marvel at the stunning visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable black and white movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I bought a box set of King Kong,King Kong escapes and King Kong v Godzilla I had a feeling that I was going to be a little disappointed but I was a lot wrong.If you don't know the plot its about a man named Carl Denham who is trying to find the perfect woman for his picture. When one of his crew members doesn't seem to make an effort in finding a woman Carl decides to find a woman himself.When he finds a woman named Ann Darrow he tells her about the picture(but not every detail)she decides that she will do it.But everything goes wrong and she is soon sacrificed to King Kong on Skull island.This movie may be very cheesy but the technology really surprised me and no wonder they call it a classic.This may have a slow start but the action is surprising for a movie that was made in 1933.The sound effects are amazing but I'm still giving it 6/10 for the slow start and the not so good ending.I recommend this movie to people who are fans of movies from the 1930's.Who knows,you might find it better than I did but all in all a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia, mayhap?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've sat through this movie a couple of times. Most recently was the other night as I did a marathon of all three King Kong movies. Thismovie may have been excellent for its time, but I just don't think it has aged that well. I think the strongest part of this movie are the special effects. Stop motion, or otherwise, the man in control of the effects had a good feel for his limitations and the audiences probable toleration for those limitations, and managed them well. The weakest part of this movie is the acting. Really, this whole national fascination with Fay Wray still puzzles me. She started off OK, when she is the starving waif, rescued off the street by Robert Armstrong,and the subsequent conversation in the diner. Once she hits the ship and starts interacting with Bruce Cabot she gets shrill and only gets shriller as the movie goes on. If she's an inspiration for scream queens, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre owes her a debt of gratitude, because thats the only screaming that's ever come close to competing (at least that I've heard). Robert Armstrong as Carl Denham is mildly interesting, but Bruce Cabot as Jack Driscoll is stiffer than dry oak. People thought this guy was romantic? For everything between good and bad, there was the script and plot, which have aged fairly well. Many people fueled on the nitrous pace of modern movies may find this a bit languid, but it still moves along reasonably. For the feature attraction, King Kong (the ape,not the movie) is a decent experiment. There is care and love put into this, it is obvious. He moves fairly smoothly, and his expressions, while occasionally goofy and doll-like, are remarkably humanistic. I've had a good time watching the movie, multiple times, and while I can't place it as a great movie,it has obviously inspired countless movies and monsters, and as such is innovative. Also, as the key word-multiple. I've seen it several times and yet to get bored with it, always a plus with any movie. Definitely worth a watch, at least once. I bought a single-disc edition, on the cheap, which I recommend if you are going to purchase it. A six on a ten point, 6.4 on a 100 point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual in these sort of movies, the mechanical monster has more depth than any of the human beings, which isn't saying much. Ham-fisted dramatics alternate with creaky special effects and a vulgar emphasis on sex and violence for its own sake. It was a box office success in the midst of the Great Depression but you would have to be extremely depressed today for a movie like this to lift your spirits any: good for a few derisory chuckles, perhaps, but little else. And, if you pause to consider the influence this trash has had on the Hollywood Sausage Factory over the decades, you may not be in the mood for even a chuckle. That this dreck may make you long for a fantasy with some intelligence to it or some real human beings in it, like Cocteau's La Belle et la B?te, is about the best that can be said for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that a film's greatness can change over time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two types of classics: those that are timeless because of their strong acting, relatable characters, and enduring stories and those that people remember as being significant but are dated by unnatural performances, undeveloped characters, and pointless narratives. I put great movies like It's A Wonderful Life (1946), Casablanca (1942), and 12 Angry Men (1957) in the first category. They hold up against any movie made today. Unfortunately, after rewatching the original King Kong (1933), I have to put it in the latter group.It is difficult to decide what standards I should use to evaluate King Kong. Should I consider the acting and special effects good because they met and surpassed the expectations of the time or should I evaluate it based on its entertainment value to me today? I think that this movie calls for a refinement of the term "classic." Just because a movie was once incredible does not mean it still is. On the other hand, this film was a remarkable achievement when it was released and it's easy to understand why audiences back then were blown away.I'm not usually one to care about special effects but as they are so integral to King Kong, I feel I have to address how unrealistic they are by comparison with the best effects of today. The stop motion is rather obvious, jerky, and in desperate need of a motion blur. What is impressive are the miniature sets and blending of models with live action. Unfortunately, King Kong, the star of the picture, moves very unrealistically, particularly in his first few shots. He slides around like he barely has any weight, which of course, he doesn't, being a small puppet. Kong also has a silly, toothy grin that may have terrified audiences when apes were seen as less intelligent creatures but now only adds to his impractical appearance. The effects are not believable enough to make the viewer feel the characters are really in danger of being killed by dinosaurs and a giant gorilla and the characters are so uninteresting that I wouldn't care even if they were.Another thing that doesn't help the film is the poor writing and character development. The human characters lack charisma and intelligence. Ann Darrow, famously played by Fay Wray, is sweet and beautiful but a bit of an airhead. The third point of the human-ape-human love triangle, Jack Driscoll, is a stiff. Everyone in the film delivers their lines like they are in an elementary school play, and while this theatrical, unrealistic method of acting may have been in style in the 30s, it carries no appeal when compared with films that have been released since.Probably most important to me is that I've never liked the story. Fans claim that it symbolizes many things, from the slave trade to shallow views of relationships, but I don't believe director Merian C. Cooper set out to do anything more than create a fun monster flick. He certainly did not seem to have much sympathy for Kong, casting himself and his producer as the pilots who shoot the gorilla and saying, "we should kill the son of a bitch ourselves." In the original, there is not much sensitivity displayed towards the ape. He is more of a mindless beast that must be dealt with by the ultimately good humans. Remakes have attempted to retell the tale with a greater emotional impact, creating a sympathetic Kong, but this only worsens it, because everyone knows that the movie will end with the giant ape dead. Callous audiences of the early thirties may have rejoiced at seeing the gorilla toppled, but it is not what any audience who understands Kong would want. If King Kong is a tragedy then surely there should be a lesson behind it but there doesn't seem to be. According to the characters within the film, it is a "beauty and the beast" tale, only no one learns anything and the beast is pretty much just a beast. Perhaps it is meant to send a message to the ugly viewers like me, warning us not to mess with the attractive people or we will be machine gunned off of a tall building. Once again I ask myself if the movie should be evaluated based on how much I like it or how much I might have liked it in 1933? The only thing I can do is respect it for its ambition and technical innovation. I cannot really enjoy King Kong enough while watching it to recommend it for more than an enlightening look into film-making of the past or for laughs at its cheesiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, but extremely dated in effects and execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did I watch the same film as everyone else?Unlike other old classics, this film has not aged well at all. I am going to go against the critical opinion and say that I don't care for it, whilst recognising that it has ?survived' the test of time as far as many viewers are concerned.This is a film that like most modern blockbusters, relies on special effects for it's impact. There is a very thin plot. The film is merely a sequence of situations and set-pieces. There is nothing special about the dialogue and the acting is very cheesy. Unfortunately, the special effects, in this film by Willis O'Brien the stop-motion pioneer, are incredibly dated, far more dated than the work of Ray Harryhausen (which to my way of thinking, still hold up well to today's effects). Harryhausen completely outstripped his mentor and made stop-motion into a complete artform with proper animal movements and characterisation etc. O'Brien seems not to pay attention to proper movement or make any attempt to smooth out the animation, he seems to think that achieving animation is enough. His puppets also only ever look like puppets. What he achieved was fantastic for it's time, no doubt about it but it does not hold up for the modern viewer.What does that leave us with then? Dated SFX against a background of a thin story, a script that joins the dots, corny acting and a largely offensive, racist view of island natives. It is also too violent and scary for young children. Don't get me wrong, the film has an undeniable charm and a sense of blazing a trail for the cinema of the day but in the final analysis, it is a film of it's time, not for ALL time. One for nostalgists and young children who don't easily scare only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst movie that I have seen in a long time. Not only did I find this movie to be slow moving, I found it to be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I am sorry maybe I should have seen the oldest king Kong first, but I find myself comparing it to the 2005 version and it does just not stack up. I think my main issue is with the look of the monster, and yes I understand that comparing old movies with cgi is not a fair comparison,however I thought that even for the times they could have made him more convincing. My favorite part is when the beast got shot at the end climbing the empire state building for two reasons. One, it was the only scene that I found exciting, and two, I knew it was over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong is surly one of the most overrated films ever, it is not bad by any means but is not great either. It is one of the biggest mistakes made by AFI, not the biggest for sure Network was one of the worst films ever and AFI had it in their 100 best movies ever list. King Kong was at least a very good film even if it's nothing, well not nothing great. Another thing that surprised me one heck of a lot was that the remake was better than the original. That almost never happens, ever and here we go it did. The film could have been better if they had lacked Fay Wray who is in my opinion one of the most overrated actors ever just behind the horrible John Wayne. Wrays performance was one of the worst in history Naomi Watts was so much better in the roll of Ann Darrow. The other performances were a lot better but she was just so darn bad in this movie. The visual effects are decent for the time but the 1925 version of The Lost World actually had better ones. The film also seemed rushed at times and after I saw this I saw the Peter Jackson remake and that was an hour and a half longer and didn't seem long at all. Go see the remake but it also may be worth seeing this one I will watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the old days and at that particular time, this was considered quite a scary film about a huge monster that beats all animals by size. Basically a film director is on a boat heading towards what he thinks is a baron and empty island to film, but they discover there are people living on the island. They cannot understand them, but the interpreter understand they talk about something called The Kong. Then they discover the scary Kong himself. A huge king gorilla bigger than anything they have ever seen. He can beat a Tyrannosaurus Rex! They manage to capture this creature and take it to New York, but it escapes and climbs The Empire State Building with the main girl in his hand. When Kong dies, rather sadly, there is the great quote, number 84 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, "Oh, no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast." Peter Jackson's version is much longer, it is a very good remake, but the original is some what more fun (and the critics give it five stars, not four). It was number 13 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 24 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 62 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 43 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Films.

		<shortDescription>Mostly old fashioned, but with a great end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't agree with all the other comments. 'King Kong' hasn't the most spectacular effects ever done. Maybe it has among of the worst special effects ever, at least in the context of famous classic films. If you want to pay tribute to old movies effects, pay it to "Nosferatu" (1922). That movie had great effects for it's time, but in 11 years it didn't seem to happen that much. Couldn't they have done it better with the stop motion? Some of the effects are bad enough to make it hard to enjoy it. "King Kong" was overall a big disappointment. Can any woman enjoy this? The blonde girl seems unable to do anything! All you hear in the beginning is "Woman causes trouble" and in the end, much was the woman's fault. Kong would never died if they didn't have that woman: Is that really okay? And what about the black natives? "Wild Savages". Just after some minutes they made them look unintelligent - not very modern.This could have been better. Even if it is just a 'Monster movie', I think the acting could to be good, but here it is not.I like the expressions on Kong in the end. He looks sad and suddenly so innocent. And he is never really evil. It is like he understands how dangerous the human are and what it has done to him. He realize his mistake and looks forsaken. When the airplanes shots him, he notice he is not immortal and it seems to be such a big disappointment for him. And just before he is about to fall, he seem to complaining over his destiny. The expressions in his eyes is the highest quality of this film. It really gives it a powerful dimension. When Kong falls, I feel sorry for him. Therefore this movie shows how easy it is to make us sympathize with a character in a movie. And I starts to wonder: Did the makers of 'King Kong' try to make the human to look great or is the human the mentioned beast?The fight with the T-Rex earlier in the film is quite exciting. At least they managed to do a great battle scene there. Rating: 6 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There must be a country song that goes ? How can something so good become something so bad? Unleashed on an unsuspecting Depression-era American public when "talkies" were not yet five years old, with old Masters like Chaplin still releasing silent films and heroes like Gary Cooper and John Wayne youthfully laying the groundwork of movie-stardom with "realistic" films, "King Kong" - the film itself, like its titular ape ? became the eighth wonder of the world.In its day, a 10-star movie, no quibbling as to its pioneering, bombastic, brain-withering primacy. Unfortunately, instead of aging like a fine wine, it has aged like a Big Mac.We all grew up revering this film as a mythical emblem of our past innocence. Watching it today, even though we clearly see fingerprints all over Kong as his plasticine body is re-shaped every second, we can still shudder at that old black magic created by stop-motion pioneer Willis O'Brien (long before his protg Ray Harryhausen usurped that particular crown from him), but we must steel ourselves to cringe in embarrassment when bad actress Fay Wray (as bad actress Ann Darrow) lights up the screen with her dim bulb; when Robert Armstrong (as director Carl Denham) swishes about in theatrical, melodramatic overcheese; when Bruce Cabot (as Jack Driscoll), being accused by Denham of being a "hard-boiled egg getting a look at a pretty face and going sappy" effeminately puts his hand on his hip (wearing a pair of pants high enough on his chest to be considered cool by a generation now in senior diapers), and challenges, "Now who's going sappy?" With modern eyes, we see Merian C. Cooper's and Ernest B. Schoedsack's slam-bang 1933 juggernaut as the above-average B-Movie it always was.As loathe as I am to finally admit it, "King Kong" is unwatchable (except for its cute little stop-motion segments, and they, only for academic value), unless we ignore practically every element which made it what it was. "Acting" has progressed to levels undreamt of by the melodramatic stage actors populating "Kong"; social mors have allowed more realistic portrayal of man-woman interaction on screen, and filmic sophistication in general has risen far above the groundling stage of the four writers of "Kong" (Merian Cooper, Edgar Wallace, James Ashmore Creelman and Ruth Rose) who penned a screenstory neglecting to give their characters plausible motivation and realistic actions.A movie-making party headed by Denham somehow sail to the mysterious Skull Island on a studio set, which doesn't resemble a boat so much as a rock-solid piece of carpentry (ignore the fact that Denham's hired boat captain exhibits not one jot of concern for steaming his barge into uncharted waters); to find the natives merely loin-clothed African-American extras from Central Casting (ignore the fact they've built a giant wall to keep a monster at bay - with a giant door big enough for it to get through).Captain Mild-Mannered runs translation (saying "bala" just a little too frequently), but even with the strange dialect, we fully apprehend he speaks without prepositions; exactly the way White America spoke to Native Americans in old cowboy movies, exactly the way the Asian cook complained onboard ship, "Someday me go back China, never see no more potato." Thank you, Whitey Dialog Coach.When the natives kidnap Ann as sacrifice to their giant ape-god Kong, the movie simultaneously launches into Adventure Genius and Stupidity Central. (We ignore that Kong risks his life battling a tyrannosaur for a smidgen of blonde flesh he picked up no more than ten minutes ago. We also ignore the herbivorous sauropod chasing humans and eating them ? while roaring like an ocelot! - with the headache-inducing score trumpeting along like a breakneck keystone cop.) We try to ignore, but are force-fed, the primitive attitudes of Shoot First, Don't Bother Asking Questions Later. The first animal Denham's party encounters behind the prehistoric wall ? a stegosaurus ? is perfunctorily shot dead without hesitation, after which Denham actually laments, "If only we could bring back one of these things alive?" Well, the first step, White Hunter, is to NOT shoot it! And ultimately, we ignore that the foremost thematic element, alluded to incessantly by Denham ? the vaunted "Beauty and Beast" imbroglio ? is entirely non-existent. Oh, there's the Beast all right, whose unrequited infatuation with Darrow stinks of 1930s anthropocentrism, rather than any instinctual or paternal legitimacy (i.e. humans are so damn important that a blonde one will get the juices of any species flowing) ? and there's Darrow, whose interaction with the Beast consists of irritating, mind-numbing screaming and grand theatrical gestures relegated to B-Movie creature features, not exhibiting one whit of compassion towards her ape captor. But Fay Wray is in this script not for any romantic "Beauty and Beast" dichotomy, rather by Studio Decree - that every movie monster have a female captive, to give man-heroes purpose to chase the monsters, and to arouse what passed for prurient interest in those bygone days, when female knees were masturbation fantasies. Ignore ? and continue enjoying the movie?Finally, after Kong's hydraulic hand picks Ann out of her apartment (where Driscoll valiantly battles the hand while Ann uses the opportunity to lie motionless on the bed and scream like the retard we grow to suspect she is), we ignore the fact that climbing to the top of the Empire State Building, and remaining there after discovering it is a dead end, is strategically asinine for an instinctual animal. Ann, meanwhile, seems more than happy to see her "beloved" Beast gunned down, after which Denham snidely misplaces the blame and, lying to himself ? and the movie audience ? laments "it was Beauty killed the Beast." Considering that Kong is part of nature's beauty and that Denham heartlessly dragged the ape to civilization for exploitation, I'd say "it was Beast killed Beauty."How about *them* bananas?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This old movie is still very popular after all these years or at least quite acclaimed.I've been wanting to watch this for a while. I even saw a trailer on YouTube and it seemed to be cool. Now, after watching it, it was nothing of what I expected.This movie is awfully dated now. It has aged badly. It's not because it is in black and white. There are great movies in black and white that have aged with great dignity, such as Ted Tetzlaff's 'The Window'.There is no denying that 'King Kong' must have been an innovative film in its day. I guess in 1933 people had never seen anything quite like this before and were amazed. Well, in 1925 they already had a great surprise with 'The Lost World', which this one has much in common with. But this one went even farther thanks to the introduction of sound (and what a sound!) and even more difficult animation. This also has got a bit of 'Beauty and the Beast', as King Kong (the great gorilla) seems to fall in love with Fay Wray's character.King Kong looks so phony but his roars still give chills. Not to mention that it is more fierce than you might expect for a movie this old. One of the best effects is when King Kong climbs the Empire State Building and reaches its top (and the scenes with planes).But for nowadays standards it just doesn't work. Besides, while it was a good film for the early 1930's, it is boring now. And the bits with the natives nearly made me fall asleep of boredom.Actors were okay in their roles. Fay Wray was great in her role (generally likable) and she was pretty but her constant loud scream is a little too much. The Driscoll character was a bit of an irony, as he speaks like that about all women and yet he falls in love with Fay Wray's character.With all due respect to its fans, but this movie did very little for me.</fullReview>

I know it was made in the 1930s where there wasn't a lot of technology then. But it still was dreadful to watch. The sounds were horrible. It was like nails on a chalk board when the ape would shout. The picture and special effects were terrible. The plot of story was messy, not realistic in anyway. People in my opinion want to watch films that are more realistic. Yes you can have your fairy's and big apes in a fantasy world, but make it believable. I surprise they made this public to the people, especially for the haze rules.</fullReview>

But, seeing it now, and then seeing PJacksons remake, i cannot help but feel that the original was...far below sub-par. Although I wasn't perturbed by the crapperiffic effects, the fight scenes seemed incredibly labored, and done just to impress. Kong's fighting of the T-Rex was interesting, but got old fast, and his playing with it's broken jaw was cute for a moment, but got quite boring quite fast. And the complete absurdity of Kong's snap decision to start chomping on ppl was enough to make me snort with laughter. And, last, while I love Fay Wray, Ann to me was a disappointment. I'd been brought up with the impression that her character loved Kong, only to discover that had been added in the first remake. I liked the idea that a woman could love (note: not fall IN love) such an untameable beast that she knew killed people. But her constant screaming and hatred for Kong disappointed me immensely.I understand that for the time it was good, but watching it now, it's just not worth it.</fullReview>

Since it's so old, my expectations wasn't all time high, but neither that low either. First of all, everyone who plans to watch this has to be prepared, because of it's age. Since it's so old, there are things that would have better today. The worst is the music. Really irritating and dramatic orchestra-music is playing in the background for most of the movie. As a friend of mine told me: "I had to turn down the volume when watching this". But don't be mistaken, the music doesn't ruin the film. The things that happen in it are really interesting, and I was impressed by how good the giant ape and some other monsters looked, knowing that it's a more than 70 years old movie. The last scene on Empire State Building is one of the most classic moments in movie history. Don't miss that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a definite problem with movies like "king kong" is that time is not kind to them... i refer of course to a few things... the attitudes of the day filtering through, the style of acting, and the special effects..."king kong" is a superb mine of iconic images... standing on tallest skyscraper, breaking through the forest, the screaming woman in his hand, the mysterious island... i think the legacy of kong is trapped in the stills, not the movie itself...i'm notoriously biased against older movies, and i'm trying to be objective with this one, as it is a greatly loved piece of work... but, to be fair, it is not one that weathers well...the score is a piece of pure nostalgia and a textbook example of one of the things i find hard to bear about older movies... no subtlety, just a jarring, intrusive mess of brass...the special effects do not hold up, but they must have been breathtaking in the day... i realise there were limitations but there are some great shots... my biggest quibble would be the close-ups of kong's face... perhaps those should have been left out, as he seems to be incapable of any expression besides that of a wind-up cymbal monkey doll...story wise, kong is a finest example of "it was better in my day" syndrome... people will swear blind that modern creature movies are dull and pointless... kong had the benefit of freshness, but the story stinks... all these years (i saw it recently) i think i had built up a myth of what i would find inside the DVD case... the sad tale of a misunderstood beast...instead, kong is simply a giant fighting machine... nothing more... he destroys randomly, and has nothing to offer besides violence... the movie ends with a trite, pithy one liner!... and the character that brought about kong's death (and indeed the deaths of many people), denham, is not even taken into custody for his disregard for safety... and no-one even says anything to that effect!...one of the worst moments was when the crew first encounter a dinosaur... not one of them seem surprised AT ALL, after slaying one of the creatures... nothing was believable, and i'm not talking about giant apes and dinosaurs... the plot was simply ridiculous in the manner which it is presented...there were some moments of horror which do retain some of their power, and this i give the production credit for... i wonder how those scenes were received in the day... i found the effects impressive considering their age, but unconvincing to the jaded modern eye...i suppose i expected too much, as this was one of the firsts of its kind... but the acting was poor, the script weak, and the story thin... it is a piece of film history and should probably be seen by anyone serious about movies, and must be viewed heavily in context... as for entertainment, i think the recent remake is probably a good idea... a movie built on special effects probably needs to be updated every fifty years to stay relevant... both socially and technologically... perhaps that is the best way to ensure the legacy of such a groundbreaking but hollow movie remains strong and vital...one last point... it is clear that no-one involved in this movie considered presenting the gorilla as anything remotely like the actual creature in terms of behaviour... i suppose we must accept its exceptional size as a reason for its unpredictable and unlikely actions... quite a lot to swallow with your popcorn, isn't it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure that "King Kong" would have been my favorite movie when I was five or six years old.I really would have loved it,but now I think the special effects are VERY silly and the story is stupid but its still entertaining and the end at Empire State Building is a classic.But I would not call it a masterpiece.3+/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong (1933)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original King Kong gives the impression of having actually been made by a character not dissimilar to the reprehensible movie-maker in the film. We have a main character who goes blundering in to another human society as well as a pristine natural time preserve, and disrupts both terribly. He causes the deaths of many of his own boat crew and many of the natives, and then causes the slow and painful demise of King Kong himself. It is certainly not beauty that kills the beast, but rather a marriage of extreme greed and extreme ignorance.I have heard that there were some voices to this effect in 1933, but I don't have documentation of that. I imagine there would always be a minority sensitive enough, or sane enough, to see the rampant irresponsibility in the actions of the the movie's fictional movie-maker; or else maybe most people who might see that wouldn't likely be watching King Kong in the first place. But I don't think that; everyone must have been curious about this movie at one time or another.But why just 3 out of 10? Because the storyline itself is thin as thin can be; because there is no characterization or development of anything in the film at all; because gross mistakes are made through sheer ignorance of both people and wildlife throughout; because gratuitous violence reigns supreme; and because no consideration or thought or process is given to any element within the film at all.What we are left with is pretty much arcade-level juvenile violence as cheap thrills. In a word, ignorance. You could write a story just as entertaining, just as silly, just as spectacular, and just as much far-fetched fun, and still retain elements of both sensitivity and intelligence. Ain't hard to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just not good anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I get that this was a classic film, that changed a lot about filmmaking, but that doesn't change the fact that its boring. I'm sure in the 1930s when it came out the big bad gorilla turned sideshow was an absolutely mind-blowing frightening experience, but now it just makes me yawn and occasionally laugh. I hate the idea that people can not admit when a film is dated, and this film is dated. Just because it used to be amazing, does not mean that it is anymore, and in this case especially its just cheesy. King Kong is so fake he makes me laugh and the story progresses so slowly I'd rather read a book. I'm not going to get into specifcs and I am commenting on this film, when it could be a blanket statement about dated movies, but some films stay good even thought they are old, and some just get cheesy. This is CHEESY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what an awful boring film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i watched this movie only because others on IMDb were saying what a classic and i watched it to see what the fuss was all about. I'm trying not to be critical cause back in those days they didn't have the technology that we have so therefore they won't able to make it up to our standard of technology,what i am trying to say that it takes forever to see king kong and once you do he kills a few dinosaurs and then he is captured and taken to the city and then he escapes again. Wow how exciting? not. If you want to see something better perphaps the remake by Peter Jackson would be more interesting. But for those who were around in that time it is understandable for why this would be seen to you as a classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great animation, but out-of-date acting and direction turn this into and unintentional comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am about commit heresy. Whenever this movie shows up on television, it is given a 4-star rating, and the commentator just gushes about how great it is. I beg to differ. The truly great works of literature, stage, and screen have a timeless quality. For example, the 1968 movie version of "Romeo and Juliet" was done with Shakespeare's dialog and period costumes. Yet the teenagers of that time (including me) flocked to the theaters. They could STILL identify with the story and characters. "King Kong" (1933) may have been considered a great film at its original release, but it has not held its ground over time. The gestures, the dialog, the direction and the acting look ridiculous today's standards. I admit that I was frequently convulsed with laughter, and so were my fellow movie patrons. The animation was superb. Too bad not much else about this movie was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what everyone is buzzing about. I simply can't see what's so great about this movie.I grant the 3 out of 10 (instead of 1) for the special effects effort - but to call this film a classic? No thanks, I expect a bit more from my classics.I saw this as a kid - didn't thrill me then. I saw it today, twenty years later - thrilled me even less. I fell asleep twice, and had to rewind, since I wanted at least to see the whole movie. (Don't know really why.)I admit that I'm not a big fan of the period acting, although "Citizen Kane" still tops my personal chart of the all time movie classics - but is there any kind of "shimmer of a classic" to be found in "King Kong"? Banal acting with banal screenplay, without anything interesting to say.Stereotype natives who actually run away scared by the rifles and then charge back when a "terrifying killing machine" attacks - hello, the logic in that?And what's with this Ann Darrow -character? Half the movie talking predictable nonsense (never knew that was possible), the other half screaming her head off. The first time she screams (on the boat, in front of Denham's camera) is exactly the same as the last time she screams. Where's the development of suspense in that? When watching the film earlier today, scream by scream the paralysing boredom bored its way into my limbs, my every cell shouting: "Do something else, you annoying woman, you!" I sure do believe that a good scream every now and then can really spice up a movie of any kind, but I guess that the recovering from the Crash -29 made people way too happy to stop and consider the possibility of inflation.And speaking of development: When we first see Kong, it roars, bangs its chest and waves its hand, those being the three things with which it tries to express itself. Those are the exact three things it will use throughout the movie to express itself. Okay, that's one more than David Hasselhoff has got, but according to my math - well, it's just not enough for a classic.And in what other ways the Kong character is being developed? It puts men in its mouth (four or five times, if I counted correctly) - which, I admit, is kind of funny - that is, unless you see Kong as the allegory of a black man brought to slavery into the US, for then it simply insinuates the inferiority and puerility of the non-white races, if the potato-pealing-bad-English-talking Charlie wasn't enough.And of course Kong fights. It fights the dinosaur, the other dinosaur, the other dinosaur and airplanes. It does its share of log-rolling, train-rail bashing and house-climbing - and with what logic? It takes the chick and gets itself as high as possible. Now if that isn't the lamest factor of suspense I've ever seen, I don't know what is.With what kind of criteria are we supposed to praise this movie as "the greatest movie ever made"? I admit the cinematographic and technical achievements, but as a genre movie (suspense/action) it lacks the psychological grip of, for example, Hitchcock's "The Birds" - and a few thousand other movies, for that matter. As a catastrophe flick it doesn't build up even nearly as tightly as "The Towering Inferno", and that's still a pretty lame picture. Musically it completely lacks the dynamics, horrible period-strings shooting out tremolos every time Kong as much as raises its stop-motion finger. As a drama picture it makes "Dumb and Dumber" look like a masterpiece.And finally, in the end, the circle closes leaving the audience at awe with what must be the most idiotic thematic conclusion there is: "Oh no, it wasn't the airplanes, it was Beauty killed the Beast!"Wow, I mean, that's a real philosophical turn-on, isn't it? And how, exactly, did Kong show us this affection to beauty? It lifted Fay Wray up and put her down thirteen times! Now if that isn't affection at its very lowest, I need some big-time therapy.I once read that "King Kong" has satirical subtext, mocking the immorality and recklessness of Hollywood film industry. Well, to that I have to say that it sure dwells deep. I'm pretty certain that at least the production team didn't have a clue.Many are worried about Peter Jackson ruining the original. What chances he has in ruining it? Is there anything to be ruined? Are people worried that Jackson might add some logic and intelligence to the story? Perhaps some original or interesting characters? Or a few lines of sensible dialogue? All right, it's of course possible that Kong might look a bit more fake, but still I'm pretty sure that it will move considerably smoother.As much as I respect the man (after "Heavenly Creatures" and even the "Ring" trilogy), I doubt that he even wants to try to better it - since he has in many an occasion declared himself as the biggest Kong-fan ever. The man is living his childhood dream, and I can grant him that - no matter what the result.If you're afraid of Jackson making an even slightly worse "King Kong", don't go see it! I will, because I'm highly interested to find out just how much Naomi Watts is going to scream. (Hmm, better find some companion to the cinema, in case I happen to get permanently paralysed.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yeah yeah this is movie history, but let's face it.........boring! i was forced to watch the 1933 and 1976 kong movies back to back for school and i was more into the 76 version (and that one stunk!). it would have been better just to see a highlight reel to respect the innovative film-making. this cannot be considered one of the best movies of all time, because it really isn't timeless. it is more like one of the most innovative films of all time. so please vote this out of the to 250. thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No emotion or memorable dialogue = Terrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am currently over half way into watching the IMDb Top 250 films. The list I work from is Feb 2010. Fortunately King Kong is no longer included in the list, however, I feel I need to vent about how much this bored me.For me, films should be judged purely on a - know nothing about it before hand and see what I can get out of it - basis. It does not matter to me how much this film has inspired other directors or other films. The fact is, I watched it from start to finish, giving it full attention and now I just feel angered.A film should draw you in and invoke an emotion, make you consider new ideas or at the very least entertain you. This did none of these. The remake of King Kong was beautifully shot and reasonably well acted, but the reason it was so good was that people could relate to Kong. The girl, by the end, felt sympathy towards Kong and so did I. It is a sad, emotional story. It is what I assumed, wrongly, that the original would have. Instead it was mindless action, bad acting, clumsy directing with no feeling.King Kong 1933, thank you for everything you have done for film. Do not allow yourself to be watched again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>kong is all about the log scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much as PULP FICTION is all about the pawn shop scene, and the rest of the movie you sleep through, KING KONG is all about the log scene, and that's about it. The movie can be divided in two halves. The first half, the exciting half, in which we go on a cruise and land on an exotic island with dangerous gigantic animals who want to eat people, is the reason people watch the movie. The second half, which is set in New York, is what is known as the boring half, and is best slept through. There is a lot of action, but the scenery doesn't evoke any interest. We have a big ape just murdering people. And the director was very heavy handed in the neo-Nazi ideal of the blonde woman being special. For some reason, he has Kong grab a brunette, whom he cannot possibly mistake for Fay Wray, and throw her down several stories. This can only be described as heavy handed Nazi ideology, which was the most glaring weakness of old films. The ideology didn't fade away until the 1980s. The scene just doesn't make any sense. Of course, most of the movie doesn't make sense. It is more believable if Kong was to think of a tiny human woman as a pet and have a maternal instinct, the way we do over our kitties, but not to have a sexual interest. I don't see how anyone could buy that. The log scene is the exciting part. A lot of it was cut for being graphic. It was redone in the modern version. Oh, and beauty didn't kill the beast. Airplanes did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By today's standards? Crap!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty makes beast fall in love, for this he dies. I've known the story since I was a kid but haven't actually seen this 1933 super classic until now. Peter Jackson's remake made me do it.It is difficult to know whether one should judge King Kong by the standards of today or by some 70 years old. Obviously this movie had a tremendous impact on popular culture, being one of the first monster flicks. Thus I feel a bit bad about having to admit that I find King Kong to be a really, really boring movie. There are just too many long and pointless fight scenes that do nothing for the story; Kong versus dinosaur number one, two and three; Kong versus a giant snake; Kong versus the natives, the ships crew and, of course, the biplanes on top of the empire state building. And that's not counting the fights without Kong. I guess I wouldn't mind so much if the special effects were o.k., but today they look absolutely fake and, well you know, 70 years old. Hats off for trying and making a big contribution to special effects history though.Add to this racial stereotypes, a thoroughly useless woman, no character development, bad acting and badly written lines and you've got yourself an hour and a half of "Please end!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slave trade tale-- It stinks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the longest lasting, and "greatest" movies of all-time. This film is nothing more than a thinly veiled allegory about the slave trade. The white man taking the largest black thing he can find and brings it back to the US just to make some money. Then the stereotypical racist image of the black man does just what the white man dreads the most. Kong breaks free, and takes a white woman with him. He endangers her and Jack has to go to the top of the Empire State Building to save her from the black menace.This movie made me sick, I cannot believe that others do not see this.</fullReview>
