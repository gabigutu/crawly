		<shortDescription>One of the great movies of my youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"King Kong" was one of my all-time favorite movies when I was a teenager. It was the big 'event' movie of 1976 and showed on two screens in most multiplexes. It might have been the first movie to get that treatment. With a production cost of $24 million it was the most expensive movie ever made at that time.Promotional material offered for sale dwarfed anything that had been done in that area before. A fast-food joint offered King Kong collectible glasses (I still have a set). And you could find posters, T-shirts and a 'Making Of King Kong' book.I very much enjoyed 'King Kong' as a 17-year-old high school senior, but not so much later as an adult. The romance between Dwan and Jack seemed contrived once I got older. Other aspects of the film struck me as just dumb. Like the ship's radar being able to pick up Kong when he was walking around the island. Or the SUNNY aerial shot of the people walking on the allegedly fog-shrouded island. Or Jack's theory that the fog was produced not by a huge supply of crude oil near the surface, but by 'animal respiration.' As if King Kong's breathing caused the fog bank. Give me a break!Yet there's something about movies one enjoyed as a youth that makes them special for the rest of one's life, no matter how bad they really are.But 'King Kong' had it's good points, too. First of all, it was funny. Charles Grodin's portrayal of the greedy, desperate oil company executive is scenery-chewing at its best. For years after, I watched in vain for Grodin to play a similar character, but everything else he has done is nothing like his work in 'King Kong.' (Nothing as good either, I might add.)Speaking of singular performances, you won't recognize René Auberjonois if your frame of reference is his work on 'Benson' and 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.' The voice he uses in 'King Kong' is nothing like the gravely voice we're used to hearing.Jeff Bridges is perfect in the role of Jack Prescott. His long hair is a nice touch, although it probably turned off some of the older people in the theater. Jeff has a way with a sarcastic line that few actors can equal.Jessica Lange comes off worse than any other actor in the film. Not because of her performance, which is fine, but because her character is an airhead who is only there to be protected (and rescued when that doesn't work) from Kong. The fact that her costumes were chosen for their ability to showcase her body and that her breasts are briefly visible when Kong undresses her has got to make the actress cringe nowadays when she thinks about this movie.I'll close by noting that John Barry's score of 'King Kong' was terrific. Twenty-six years after the movie debuted and I can still remember the title tune.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Does Everyone Hate This Version?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People seem to jump on the old' bandwagon when bashing Kong '76. It's not that bad!!! For '76 I'd say it was quite an achievement. Lange is great in it (and quite stunningly beautiful) and Bridges always rules. Can't go wrong with this version... don't believe the negative hype. I, for one, appreciate it when someone does a remake and actually interprets the story differently. Carpenter did it with The Thing and Cronenberg did it with the fly and both were amazing. I think this movies gets more negative comments because they are comparing it to the original, which back in its day was the first movie of its kind (Mighty Joe Young is still better!). For movie purists, the thought of remaking a landmark film is always touchy territory. Thus, they rip the remake. The core story is still basically the same, the writers just updated key elements that were pivotal 'classic' moments from the original (empire state building for one). Again the purists cry foul. Bottomline, see it and give it a chance... ignore the pompous so called "experts".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to admit this having read many of the reviews but I can't help but enjoy "King Kong". Yes I realize it is silly and yest I realize the special effects aren't.... well, special. But I was 11 years old when this came out at Christmas in 1976. The hype was huge. The posters screamed that it was "The Motion Picutre Event of Our Time". I was caught up in it all and the film has a lot of fond memories for me.On the positive side I think John Barry's score is one of his best. The lack of an Oscar nomination was a crime. Jeff Bridges and Charles Grodin (playing a bad guy for a change) are acceptable in their roles. Jessica Lange didn't exactly hint there was a two time Oscar winner present but she looked awfully good. And the supporting cast featuring character actors (Ed Lauter, John Randolph, etc) we've seen over and over again.It's no classic. It may not even be that good. But every time it's on I watch it and enjoy it despite its flaws. I guess that's what a guilty pleasure is all about. And this may be my guiltiest pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"King" of the remakes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'll admit that I was a kid when I first saw this so this review is done wearing rose-colored glasses. But having seen this '76 remake of "King Kong", my opinion hasn't changed much: it's still great! Maybe not the equal of the original, but how could it be? It does well enough in its own behalf.The music grabs you right off: John Barry did aces with his pounding, dramatic score. And you couldn't ask for a better cast; Lange does okay for a first role, Bridges makes linear-thought acting look easy and Grodin is about as slimy a baddie as you could ask for. The bit parts are also filled with familiar faces (Bernsen, Piscopo, Auberjoinois, Lauter, Randolph and Lone) who acquit themselves quite well.A lot of people blast the monkey suit. But I think Rick Baker did a good job with it. Of COURSE it's a guy in a monkey suit, but it's a guy in a WELL-DONE monkey suit. It still gets me when Kong blew-dry Dwan (Lange after her waterfall shower); those puffed-out cheeks, especially in 1976, were high tech enough for me (remember, this was before "Star Wars" came out).But we all know how the story works; any of us who have a rudimentary knowledge of the original, that is. The new twist was having the emotional connection between Lange and ape. More enlightened than having her scream endlessly. The Twin Towers scene near the end was not only exciting but quietly moving, as it showed just how much the beast cared for his beauty.There's plenty of corn in this one, no argument, but it's corn for a good cause. I loved "King Kong" and if I had a chance, I'd buy a copy! Anyone have John Guillermin's phone number?Seven stars for "Kong"; long live the "King"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GUILTY PLEASURE FOR SURE- I LOVE IT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another poster called this Kong a guilty pleasure. I agree. It's flawed and the special effects are not very special by today's standards and there's a lot of silly stuff. I won't argue about any of that. It's all true. And so what? I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I love the flaws and the not-so-special effects and all of the silly stuff. I enjoyed Dwan's comment about telling Prescott's sign by his ears and all of her silly lines to Kong. Jessica Lange is beautiful, lovely, and wonderful. Jeff Bridges is excellent too and how can ya not hate Charles Grodin in this? He's the character I most love to hate! Great work! King Kong himself is always entertaining in this even if he is incredibly goofy at times depending on which special effect they used. The giant robot Kong just kills me! LOL! I loved it! When they use an actor in a costume it works better and dammit this Kong has got the most soulful eyes! My heart strings were tugged by this sweet and silly movie. POOR KONG! HE'S JUST LOOKIN' FOR LOVE! WHY CAN'T THEY JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE?! I guess if they did there'd be no movie. No this isn't a perfect movie but I agree with the poster who said this movie is an old friend. All of the flaws are part of it's charm and I've had a wonderful time with this Kong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated quality remake of the ultimate monster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always feel this movie did not get the credit it deserved. O.K. it was not as good as the original but has any monster movie ever matched it? The effects and story are very entertaining and Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges are well cast. My favourite touch was the selection of the World Trade Center instead of the Empire State Building for the finale. Shame you could not see it well in the dark however. The film is great fun for any movie or monster movie fan. Watch, enjoy and await the UK DVD release. Superb entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definately has its moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era when many hollywood blockbusters are criticised for an over-reliance on sophisticated special effects to the detriment of everything else, this poorly remembered remake stands as a cautionary example of what can happen when a basically decent film gets let down by low-tech back up.Producer Dino De Laurentis both cheated and deceived his audience here; selling the film on the hype of a state of the art full-size hydraulic ape that would re-define the effects landscape. Instead, what we got was the tired old fallback of the man in a monkey suit waddling bow-legged around some highly unconvincing sets.Its such a shame because this film actually has a lot going for it. The screenplay is sprightly, good-humoured and faithful to the original while updating it with some then topical issues like fuel crises, feminism and even pornography. The makers also have a whale of a time with endless phallic imagery and self-referential quips more common to movies of the 90s than 70s.The characters are far more quirky and idiosynchratic than you normally get in this sort of fare; a hippie academic, a star-struck, dipsy blonde and a buttoned-up corporate shark. Lange has gone on to become one of the most honoured and respected actresses of her generation, yet her career almost died right here. She was actually so good at playing the shallow, D-list airhead that critics and public alike thought it a reflection of her real self and dismissed her out of hand. Yet looking at her performance in hindsight she just oozes skill and star quality.The film hardly puts a foot wrong until Kong appears. The production is smooth, the photography impressive, the locations superb and the story and characters engaging. But a fantasy adventure stands and falls by the suspension of disbelief achieved at the crucial moment. The first act of the 1933 Kong drags interminably until the King himself appears - then it soars. The reverse happens here; Rick Baker turns up in his ape suit, knocking down plastic trees and fighting a big rubber snake and the spell is shattered - in fact it was never even cast. The problem is also compounded by the screenplay's only serious error; making Kong sympathetic and pitiable far too early. The original Kong was always awesome and scary, even when he began to become sympathetic. Here he is just a bit too likeable, to quickly.That the film remains just about watchable after this point is a testament to the performers and the strength of the story, but ultimately this effort has to go down as a missed opportunity to make a quality remake of a legendary film. Lets hope Peter Jackson doesn't make the same mistake next time round. You can't imagine him getting the film visually wrong, but it would be ironic indeed if he fell into the modern malaise of neglecting other key elements like story and character. Indeed, he could do worse than give the first hour of this movie a peek before he puts pen to paper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film was released at Christmas of 1976 it was billed as "the motion picture event of our time." Now it seems a bit extreme but as an eager 11 year old I was sucked in. Looking at it today I admit it's certainly far from being a motion picture event. But the film has its virtues none more so then the fine performances by Jeff Bridges and Charles Grodin (in an unusual villianous role). And let's not forget the beautiful musical score by John Barry.The special effects are pretty cheap in many scenes so don't be looking for top notch in that category. I don't know....on the whole it's really not that great but I must confess that every time it is on television I watch it. This is a true guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Brilliant Films of the 70s--no, really!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong (1976) King Kong was a huge hit back in the seventies--I know because I was there, I saw the frenzy, I remember the crowded theaters. Now, admittedly, it also had a huge pr campaign, which undoubtedly helped it garner a lot of that dough, but there was a lot more to the flick than just the hype. And it could have probably been an even bigger hit if the filmmakers had played it safe and hadn't gone out of their way to make a film so stubbornly odd. I mean this thing stomps over a gigantic swath of styles: panoramic spectacle, high adventure, pathos, romance, social commentary, absurdist comedy, thrills, and occasionally outright goofiness--all comprised in a slyly satiric package designed to tweak the noses of Kong purists. Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s ("Papillon ") screenplay is all over the place when it comes to style and tone, borrowing from whatever and whenever, almost as though it had been patched together from several different treatments--yet it still remains incredibly tight in terms of interesting, well-drawn, consistent characters, witty dialog, exploration of theme, and the forward momentum of the plot. King Kong 76 is a great example of anarchic postmodernism being perfectly wed to the staunch formalism of good storytelling. A contemporary example of this approach would be Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill films.The direction by veteran John Guillermin was absolutely fearless, pushing each of Semple's concepts to its limit, even at the risk of seeming silly. And he had a great cast to work with, especially young Jessica Lange in her first film role. Unfortunately, Jessica played the role of the vivacious, childlike, kinda dimwitted bubblehead blonde Dwan so incredibly well that most people wrote her off, assuming she was just a dumb blonde playing herself. But in actuality it is a bravura performance, one of the best in her career, and certainly a more individual, more fully-realized character performance than we get in most movies these days.As big a hit as the disco era Kong was, however, there were a lot of people who were put off because they weren't expecting anything as freewheeling and insane as what they were given. They weren't expecting weirdness and satire. They weren't expecting to see Kong blowing a hot, wet blonde dry after a dip in a lake (metaphors anyone?), a scene simultaneously erotic and ridiculous. They weren't expecting to see the captured Kong turned in to a corporate shill--is there any scene in mainstream 70s cinema more surrealistically satiric than that of Kong being presented to the masses encased in a thirty story replica of a gasoline pump? They also were not expecting to see a big budget adventure film with a downer ending--the romantic leads ending up emotionally separated by their experiences instead of united. And they didn't expect to feel bad when the monster died.So I put it to you all that not only was the 1976 Kong a financial success, it was also an artistic success. But you can't watch it as a remake of a classic film. It is no more a remake of the 1933 King Kong than Quentin's Kill Bill is a remake of Sonny Chiba's Streetfighter's Revenge. Watch the film for what it is, not what you think it should have been, or what you wanted it to be, and you will be better able to appreciate its cracked brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as you will think it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1976 "King Kong" was a major deal when it came out. A huge marketing blitz was mounted, with iconic Kong imagery on everything from drinking glasses to t-shirts and jigsaw puzzles. Considering that it was so heavily promoted, and a big-budget picture, it's surprising to watch this movie now and see how silly the special effects ended up looking. I say that with reservations, because not all of it is bad. But there are some ideas that are "overly ambitious", such as an unconvincing snake attack and the Godzilla-like silliness of seeing a man in an ape suit stomping around miniature sets.But we must be careful when levelling criticism like this. Yes, the blue-screen effects are obvious...but then again so were many of the CGI effects in Peter Jackson's 2005 remake (such as a stampede of dinosaurs that looked more like a video game than a movie). The 1976 Kong works on a fantasy level that the other films don't approach. The sequence set on Skull Island doesn't really contain many intense action scenes, although it does possess a weird atmosphere all its own. The fakey shots of Kong looming above the trees are all set against weird red and blue backdrops that are obviously screens instead of sky, but the artificial quality of it is very weird. There are parts of the island that are realistic, but the jarringly dark scenes with Kong give it a nightmarish quality.The doomy 70s themes are what makes this version of "King Kong" special to me. The performances are mostly good here, too. Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges are both appealing leads, with Lange's characterization surprisingly complex. Dwan comes off as a Marilyn Monroe type who plays the dumb blonde game, but she's ambitious and conniving as well, eager for her big break and looking for whoever (or whatever) will make her a star. When romance develops between Lange and Bridges, it seems as tragic as her non-relationship with Kong. A scene where she lures Bridges into a deserted bar while on the run from Kong might be a little unrealistic, but it's an effectively bizarre moment that gives them a chance to have a heartbreaking realization: their idea of getting married can never really happen because of everything that has occurred. The excitement that brought them together has also made it unrealistic for them to be married. The life Bridges leads would not be satisfying for the ambitious Dwan, despite their attraction. Still, we get the impression that if they could just save Kong, they may still have a chance. They naively attempt to bargain with the authorities and get Kong back to his native habitat, but of course this is not possible. Kong's destruction at the end of the picture only seals their own doom. Dwan is swarmed with photographers who want to take her picture, and even though she screams for Jack, they are separated by a sea of people. It's a surprisingly powerful moment.The 1933 original and the 2005 remake are both straightforward adventures, and while the 2005 version does emphasize the tragic relationship between Kong and his girl, only the 1976 film turns it into an existential statement. There is no happy ending for anybody in this movie. They have all sold out at some level, with disastrous results. Only Kong is truly innocent and simply a victim of circumstance.Everything else around this core of the film is a gamble. There are some howlingly awful moments, such as when Kong is first displayed in New York and it's a giant, unconvincing animatronic model. Sorry, but there is no way you can make a 40-foot robot look real. The aforementioned snake is very badly realized. However, this 1976 version has the best "sacrifice" scene out of all three films, with a very engaging sequence as a seemingly drugged Dwan is prepared to meet her "groom". Kong does look like a guy in a monkey suit most of the time, although his face is amazingly realized and convincing. Due to the mixed bag that's in this movie, you may think to yourself "that was AWFUL." But it catches up to you later. Out of the silliness, you feel as if you've said goodbye to three very real characters; Dwan, Jack, and Kong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, This film is simply perfect. I haven't seen it in a while. I bet I watch it now and I will probably find plenty of errors or stuff that I would personally do different. But on the subjective level, this film is so brilliant that when I watched it for the very first time, I was like 3 or 4 years old and it blew me away back then. I felt so much for Kong that both my parents immediately saw the big impact this movie had in me. I became a fan of Kong. He was still alive in my head. I even remember I made a Kong myself using ceramic. He was like two and a half feet tall. I painted it brilliant black. He was a shining beast. Very cool for a five year old kid, you know. But Then it broke his right arm, and I believe my father threw it away. So I never saw it again. I was left with the memory I had of him in that film. I watched the Peter Jackson's remake on King Kong. It was really strong and very real. But for me, the one I will always remember goes to the 1976's version. With Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange. This film was so huge in my life that without any doubts, I can honestly admit that my desire of becoming a Film Director was born with King Kong, 1976. That's all I can say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different approach to the 1933 Kong generally works well,even if it's definitely no classic like the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reputation of this 1976 version of King Kong seems to have improved since it's initial release. It's nowhere near as good as the 1933 version,but who would really expect it to be. That remains the greatest of giant monster movies and a milestone in film-making. However,taken on it's own,this one is not bad at all.Rather than replicate the original,the filmmakers take a different approach. Some things work,some things don't,but kudos for trying. The updating of the characters for 70s sensibilities now seems as dated as the ones in the original movie,and Jessica Lange's heroine just comes across as an empty headed bimbo. The environmentalist message is still pertinent though,and the filmmakers stop short of labouring their issues.Kong himself is a lot less fearsome,in fact the man-in-suit creature seems rather cuddly. Scenes when he attacks people almost seem out of place {and compare badly with similar sequences in the original}. Look out for the brief appearance of the robot Kong prop during the scene when he breaks out of his cage,it looks nothing like the Kong of the rest of the film. Special effects are generally good though. They are generally a lot less ambitious-no dinosaurs for one thing,except for one out-of-place giant snake-but they are usually quite good.The film is a little sluggish,and seems to display little imagination at times-consider how dull the island looks in this version. However,the filmmakers were attempting a somewhat more realistic film. They also succeed in creating quite a a bit more pathos,especially at the end. John Barry's score is rarely mentioned as one of his best but it's really atmospheric,dramatic and sometimes moving. Despite some glaring flaws,this remake is certainly no disaster,and occasionally works well. Check it out,but see the older one first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't care what anybody says. I don't care how I'm supposed to feel about this movie. I don't hate it. To be honest, I kind of love it a little. Maybe if I'd been born in the 50's or 60's, and grown up loving the original, then gotten all excited about a remake, only to have my hopes dashed by a mediocre product, I'd loathe this like everyone else does. But I was born in '76. By the time I got around to being able to actually comprehend movies, this was already on T.V. every Saturday afternoon. For me, there have always been two King Kongs. Yes, the black and white ape is more believable, and scarier looking, and more lovable, and inarguably the star of a better movie. But when you're 5 years old, a man in a monkey suit is just as realistic as a stop motion model, because suspension of disbelief is not just easy for you, it's a way of life. So go ahead, hate this movie if you want. To me, it's an old friend, and I won't abandon it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasure (Sorry, NOT Guilty!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently rewatching King Kong '76, I was able to reconnect with why this movie haunts me to this day. True, I do LOVE both versions, being a bit of a MONSTER JONES, but it's Kong '76 that pushes buttons for me that other monster movies don't. It's something that goes beyond awkwardly dated special effects and trespassing upon classic cinema. By God, it IS Rick Baker in that ape suit, lumbering along to John Barry's emotionally moving music. Kong is more of an oversized, misunderstood pet, than a marauding monster. He is loyal to the death to the one who fulfills his emotional need, Jessica Lange. We like her because she looks and sounds like a Marilyn Monroe clone. He likes her because she tries to talk to him and doesn't try to hurt him. Kong is not really the source of the fear, though he does some terrible things. What really scares you is the almost overwhelming power and destructive force of the movie's true monster: modern civilization. No matter how loud Kong roars, the machine guns of three helicopter gunships are louder. Kong transformed from classic movie monster to symbol for nature and the environment in this movie, and that didn't set well with critics. Lange's Dwan, Jeff Bridges' Prescott, me and anyone else who watches events unfold in this movie with an open mind is rooting for Kong, but ultimately there's that stomach turning feeling deep in our gut that reminds us that despite our best efforts and intentions, it's not to be. The Powers That Be have decried that Kong is too big to live, it's too much trouble to capture him, he's gone too far and has to be "put down." To view Kong '76 as a MONSTER MOVIE is something of a mistake by everyone concerned. True Kong is a monster, in that he is monstrous, but like Mary Shelley's "Creature" in Frankenstein, Kong is that freak that nobody wants and everybody fears: He is the truth. The authorities knew that Kong had no place in a bustling city like New York, but instead of trying to right the wrong of their own exploitive nature, they cut the Big Guy down in a hail of bullets and make him fall to his death. Kong's death in '76 was even more pointless than in '33. In '33 it was like trying to escape a wild Grizzly bear. In '76 it was like watching your beloved pet get run over. It's a helpless sadness that transcends tears, cuts deep and somehow stays with you awhile. I sometimes stop the video of Kong '76 just as the Big Fella turns to face the choppers. So I can remember him large and in charge, on top of one of the majestic World Trade towers and giving the proverbial finger to the modern civilization that screwed him over. I let myself wonder if, had I let the movie roll this time, would the helicopters have those damn nets and would they get him back to the island. But movie memories take over and I remember exactly what happens and know that it will happen again and again. King Kong '76 is a hopelessly sad movie even for a monster flick. But, for some bizarre reason, it's always a pleasure to let Kong make me sad for a little bit...and for me, not a guilty pleasure. Sorry, naysayers. Like Dwan and Jack Prescott, I'll stand behind Kong '76 to the bitter end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'A' for effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though generally regarded as inferior to the 1933 classic - which it unquestionably is - this remake of "King Kong" can at least boast the virtue of trying to be different. No mere rehash of the older film, the story has been reinterpreted, and very occasionally the effort pays off.I rather like the notion of the explorers arriving at Kong's island with no idea of what they are going to find. The discovery of the wall - telegraphed in the original, and thus less powerful - the natives, the overall look of the island works very well.Sadly its downhill from there. The highly touted special effects are poor. Kong is so obviously a man in an ape suit that it seems astonishing that anyone was duped by tales of giant robots. (That much publicised automaton, when it briefly appears, is ragingly bogus.) Toning down Kong's ferocity was another huge mistake. In this version he is a cross eyed lover, with little menace. In the original he was a possessive and protective lover, with a real mean streak. It worked better. And Jessica Lange lacks Fay Wray's unique blend of innocence and sex appeal. She aims at ditziness, and is merely irritating. How you'll pray that Kong makes a meal of her!Its hard to dismiss memories of the 1933 film when it was so much more engaging. But this isn't too bad in a kiddie matinee fashion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie deserves a 10. I have serious doubts that Peter Jackson will tell a Kong story as well as John Guillermin did. If a friend had never seen a Kong movie; I'd tell them to see this one. Why? Because once you've seen one Kong movie, then you'll know what's coming in the other ones. This movie has spirit in surplus. It's charming, action packed, beautiful, thought provoking, and heart poundingly scary at all the right moments. Logistically, it accomplishes many production benchmarks that most filmmakers only dream of; such as acting proficiency, cinematography, dramatic timing, locations, scoring, direction, script, story-telling and good budget. John Guillermin weaves all those elements together to produce a movie that will captivate you, if you let it. It's a movie so rife with differing symbolism, that you won't be able to keep it all straight. And though Guillermin did not invent the basic story, he successfully presents us with the complexity of it; which is the greatest aspiration of every movie. Complexity like: 1. The role reversal of man and pet, where the animal becomes the master. (Including where the master's relationship turns unhealthy) 2. The need that many creatures (including humans) have to be loved by people.3. Ironically, it's the sexy Dwan who teaches us that instead of indulging one's lust, that sympathy, respect and a friend with a positive attitude is what people actually need.4. The evil that results from humanity's inclination to exploit, and indulge our greed and self-centeredness.5. How man ought to strive for a noble management of his life and his surroundings, like the environment-conscious Jack Prescott.6. Kong and Jack share a resemblance. By the criteria of their own differing species, they are noble and innocent and both are victimized by the corruption of modern society.Excellent performances from all cast members. I've never seen a better performance from Charles Grodin; he's perfect in this movie. Jeff Bridges is as good here as he ever is. Jessica Lange is also spot-on as the air headed beauty that this story needs (For it's plausible that someone naive as Dwan could genuinely care for such a terrifying beast). You'll sympathize with all the main characters. And you join each of them as they strive to and approach their dreams; and except for Jack, they all achieve. But the actual glory is not what they'd hoped for; it's tainted bitter by a price. And Jack, pure of heart yet impotent, gets nothing but the trauma of watching events turn from bad to worse.Great film-making. The views, lighting, film grade, and overall production are top notch even by today's standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only live action special effects version of King Kong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film, especially the live action special effects!The 1933 version, although great for its time, has stop action effects.The 2005 version relies much too heavily on video game style CGI rendering. Most of the special effects look extremely improbable. I suppose it is quite good, though, if you consider it primarily a cartoon.Of course, the special effects in this 1976 version are not perfect, but they mostly look real. And they are presented in a credible and civilized manner.The John Barry score is unforgettably wonderful. I sure wish iTunes sold the soundtrack!The casting and acting are superb. The performances by Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange, Charles Grodin, and John Randolph are practically flawless.The editing is mostly good, although the last part of the film seems a little chopped. I have seen a special 3-hour version compiled for television premiere that was much better in this respect.I saw this film on the big screen in a large theater when it was first released. It is as good as any action/adventure movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kong smash!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother bought me the VHS of King Kong '76 for Christmas when I was 11. Growing up I was a huge fan of giant monster movies, and still am. I have a fetish for anything Godzilla .. *cough* strange, I know. Anyway, this movie is hilarious. It is in no way comparable to the excellence of the original B&amp;W Kong, but it's a funny movie on its own. The special effects are up to par with a Godzilla flick, which isn't saying much. The story's been changed slightly from the original, and not for the better.No longer do we have a movie maker venturing to an island with a beautiful unknown actress, but a greedy oil company owner and a girl he found on a raft in the ass end of nowhere .. yep. The acting is mediocre, but overall enhances the B-Movie feel.Kong's sexual interest (yes, strange I know) becomes quite clear when he removes Dawn's dress top. He blows her dry after bathing her in a waterfall, oh the romance! Oops, stop the drama cause he comes a monster reptile to do battle with Kong. Kong is awkward and too humanoid, but he sure can fight giant snakes! Where were the Dinosaurs?! We want Dinosaurs! Kong's trip to the big apple is the only real part of the movie that I don't look away from the screen and wonder where my life has gone, and that's not saying much either. There's an extremely funny part where Kong steps on a group of people, leaving them as a squiggling and screaming half smooshed pancake - Now that's entertainment! The Train attack is pretty comical too, where Kong mistakes a helpless woman for Dawn .. and disposes of her pretty quickly.Yep, it's a really lame B-Movie romp that's sure to give you some sort of entertainment, unless your movie tastes lean towards The Piano and Elephant (Both good films .. quite) 5 stars for retarded b-movie goodness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dated "hit" remake awaiting the dawning of the Jackson era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this was first released, I loved this movie. At the time of its theatrical release, I remember that the line for tickets went around the building! While this production is now heavily dated and yes, there are campy moments, and the unbearable clichés, this was a state-of-the-art production in its time. I saw this movie on the big screen when it first came out. The lines went out and around the entire theater building in the city where I grew up. Around the building and back to the front where another line formed. Many were turned away for another showing of this blockbuster hit. However good it was then, it has lost a bit of its luster over the years. The invention and subsequent refinement of CGI has vastly dated this move. Outdated it, in fact. I cannot WAIT to see Peter Jackson's newest project; the remake of King Kong, due to be released in 2005. I bide the time in great anticipation.Jeff Bridges was a real star in this production. His character was believable and honest and his portrayal was extremely professional. I loved the way his character always got the best of Charles Grodin. It made me laugh countless times. Although the hair styles are indicative of the 70's (Bridges's makes him resemble a Wookie), as are the clothing styles, I still find this movie quite endearing, adventurous, and entertaining.The shots of the island are absolutely breathtaking. Much like the beginning shots of Jurassic Park when you first arrive. The characters were developed quite well, and the story itself is timeless. While this endeavor does start off a bit slow, the necessary character development has begun, and takes place along the way. Perhaps you can distract yourself with Lange's striking figure and half-exposed body during this time, while you get to know the characters, or let Bridges's Wookie-like appearance endear him to your heart. Dwan (Dwan?! - Lange) is a treasure; a pink lady from another world, and the natives who found her have decided that she is the perfect offering to their god; a colossal ape they have come to call "Kong." In the opening scenes featuring the introduction to Kong, he is really quite well done. You can actually believe he is a 30' ape absconding with the pismire Dwan in his hands. Later; however, the effects go wrong, with the use of animatronics. They lost the realism they had achieved, specifically during the fight scene with the giant snake.When his oil-finding expedition goes bad, Fred Wilson (Grodin) learns that the petroleum present on Kong's Island needs a little more time; just a tick of the clock, geologically speaking. In just around ten thousand more years, it will be productive petroleum. For lack of a cash cow to justify this farciful journey, Wilson determines it would be best to bring back Kong, rather than return to his New York investors empty handed. The plans of mice and men; however, are sure to twist, crumble, and fade.Be sure to make note of the scene where Charles Grodin finds himself in a hole which turns out to be Kong's footprint. It shows you where the writers/directors of "Godzilla," 1998 (the Roland Emmerich one which I like to call "Jurassiczilla"), got the idea for a nearly identical scene in that movie.The musical score is quite compelling and lends quite a bit to the feeling of mystery and wonder this movie captures, though it is classic 70's score. The sets and costumes were quite original and creatively done. I especially thought the native costuming was well designed and manufactured, with a true Polynesian feel to them.And, while some of the scenes between Lange and the ape are campy and filled with cliché after cliché, they were still endearing and heart-warming. With tongue-in-cheek, my mate has just quipped, "This movie just proves that anybody can fall in love with a rich white girl." I included that because it was the sum of the underlying camp throughout. But it somehow does not detract from the richness of the production. This movie is far greater than the sum of its parts. "King Kong: the Legend Reborn," does breathe new life into the '30's classic, as I hope Peter Jackson's remake does, and bring to it at least some of the magic he achieved in his "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.Once back in New York, Grodin's character is largely under foot as Kong escapes and begins to find his way back to Dwan. Of course, if you even momentarily try to imagine the mayhem that would be generated by such a massive beast loose in New York City, you have to stop and ask yourself if the residents there would even notice. In true Godzilla style, Kong grabs the subway train in which Lange and Bridges are escaping, and unceremoniously rips the top off of it just in time to see his beloved Dwan running away with that other man...again. Needless to say, he is not a happy camper. And, just like Godzilla, Kong quickly learns not to play with power lines.Regardless of your nationality, please pay special attention to the last scenes of this wonderful production. The NYC Twin Towers are prevalent and, though I never viewed it from this perspective before 9-11, they are now the real stars in this movie. I had no choice but to view it with a certain melancholy sadness.All in all, although admittedly not as much as when it was first released, I still greatly enjoyed this work and highly recommend its viewing; especially in light of the upcoming remake. They've changed the character's names, rearranged the story, and forgotten the dinosaurs. But in the genre of monster movies, it is a definite must-see.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It dared to be different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard nothing but abuse of this film, but in fact on watching it I loved it. I thought it was a brilliant updating of the original scenario into the then-contemporary world (when you change plans from oil discovery to ape-capture, you simply call for an airdrop; the island is discovered via illicit satellite pictures, not a hearsay map drawn by a dying man), and for me it has the emotional punch that the original just doesn't have.I was terribly disappointed when I finally saw the Cooper/Schoedsack version after enjoying this so much, since I'd heard for so long how much better it was: I was really enjoying the start, but then about halfway through it suddenly lost interest in all the characters and turned into an SFX orgy. The "Beauty and the Beast" phrase is constantly overworked, so that by the time you get to the famous last line you've heard it so often you're just tired of it; it could have been effective if they'd done it just once or twice. Fay Wray (who was a fine actress in the couple of other films of hers I've seen) is just wasted, spending more time showing her legs than showing her talent, and Bruce Cabot is simply not romantic-lead material. The one character I still liked by the end was Denham himself, and I was glad to see him show up in the sequel -- which I liked much better, being as it had far more human story and far fewer monster-fights!(It was interesting seeing the 1933 "King Kong" again after the Merian C. Cooper documentary, though, and spotting the autobiographical in-jokes!)I don't 'get' the critique that the film's politics are outdated, unless the suggestion is that oil companies don't have their share of ambitious underlings: the girl Dwan could have passed for a satire on today's I'm a Celebrity/Reality TV culture, and I'm told that primate protection is a hotter issue than ever... Actually, I liked Dwan (as a character, not as a person! Although she does come across as more sympathetic when she's interacting with the ape.) The whole astrology obsession/pretentious name/gratuitous body-flashing thing was a pretty accurate -- and hence funny -- take-off of Females I Have Known, and yet she is a recognisably real human being underneath all the man-catching trappings, with enough imagination to suffer.Most of the attacks on the film I've seen, when you get down to it, are along the lines of "how dare they? they changed the *plot*!" Which seems to me to be missing the whole point of a re-make, or of the only kind that's worth doing, anyhow: to take the heart of the story and retell it in a way that's new and yet the same. In remaking "King Kong", they took a plot that didn't work for me, cut out almost all the bits that didn't work -- no random dinosaurs as Kong fails his wandering monsters roll, no single convenient escape-vine dangling over the edge of his clifftop hideaway, no ape close-ups with rolling eye-whites, no endless 'beauty and the beast' -- cleverly updated the scenario to make the myth of the thing amazingly plausible in a modern world, and above all managed to retain the character interest all the way through. Not to mention making Kong a genuinely sympathetic creature as well as a terrifying one, and creating a biting and tragic finale.Where I thought it failed, ironically enough, was in two scenes that were a direct homage to the original. The scene where Kong rolls the log looked much more fake than all the surrounding footage, and it seemed very cursorily done: this was one of the few scenes I found effective in the original 'chase' sequence, and here it seemed very two-dimensional. And the single monster-fight that they did retain, with the inexplicable weird-headed snake, was not only unconvincing but felt as gratuitous as its predecessor (which was at least better choreographed!) It must surely have been apparent during filming that this wasn't working -- couldn't they have come up with some more imaginative way of distracting Kong at the vital moment?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know, I know--anything from the '70s that didn't star Jack Nicholson or wasn't directed by Martin Scorcese is suspect these days, and if you're talking about a heavily-hyped remake of an indisputable classic, the urge to take potshots is irresistible. But despite the dated special effects and elements of camp, the movie does not fall on its face into a Kong footprint. The doomed love that the giant beast felt for the beauty (who, in the person of Jessica Lange, is a stunner) is well-delineated, there's actual excitement and suspense, and the allusions to the rape of the environment by "civilization" are not amiss here. Moreover, the movie's intended humor really is funny. And John Barry's score has stayed with me all these years, although the same basic sound recurred in his music for "Out of Africa" and "Dances with Wolves." For anyone who was in New York on 9/11, there's an inadvertent poignancy in this movie's concluding scenes at the Twin Towers. I'm sure that within a few weeks of posting this, I will have seen Peter Jackson's new version, which updates the effects with CGI technology yet returns the story to the 1930s. Speaking of heavily-hyped remakes...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminally underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1976 remake of KING KONG has gotten a severely bad rap over the years, but why? I think a majority of the critics who lambasted this flick failed to take into account that, at heart, KING KONG '76 is a camp spoof! Critics may sing the praises of the 1933 original, but even that one was so over-the-top as to be ridiculous. The filmmakers of the remake set out to have some fun and poke some good-natured jabs at the inherent goofiness of the King Kong story. How can you take this one seriously when it's got lines like, "Let's not get eaten alive on this island--bring the mosquito spray!" And, "Who do you think when through there--a guy in an ape suit?" (Which is true--that's Rick Baker under all that fur!) A story about a fifty-foot ape that falls in love with a dumb blonde is inherently stupid--KING KONG, therefore, is big, stupid fun. It's a good adventure with great laughs sprinkled throughout. Relax and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dino Delaurentis brought this classic fairy tale to the big screen 40 years after the original, and it has become an icon of 70's cinema. It stands on it's own as a cool monster movie, and a love story. The musical score in the film is haunting and evokes memories of the mysterious island. Jack Prscott's explanation of the legend of the great beast of the island sets the pace for the film. Jessica Lange floats in on a raft wearing a tiny black cocktail dress, and is rescued by the woman-starved sailors. She plays the role of Dwan, breathlessly a la Marylin Monroe. She parades around on deck looking like a dancer at a Gentlemen's club ("care for a dance?") wearing a pair of Daisy Dukes she appears ready to burst out of, and a succession of mini-shirts! The film goes on to carefully modernise the original story, and Rick Baker in a monkey suit is the best Kong on film to date. Even Kong gets carried away by Lange's incredible sensuality and physical perfection!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is EVERYONE so down on the '76 "Kong?" I JUST don't get it. OK, the foreshadowing of the twin towers is dumb, but di Laurintis still made an excellent movie that gets bonus points for not being a slavish remake of the original version.Why do I think is it almost as good as the first? 1). It has humor, which the first one lacked.2). The actors are excellent and have space to stretch out with their characters, which is actually pretty cool for a monster movie.3). I love the comments on corporate greed and gross consumerism.4). Kong actually has a personality, and thus you sympathize with him. You are SAD when he... (can't give it away).5). Its scarier!6). The music is just as good as Max Steiner's pretty much perfect score for the original (and without a good score, a monster movie ain't nuttin').7). The film-making is smooth and photography is excellent.</fullReview>

Campy in dialogue yet surprisingly emotional more so than its predecessor making Kong sympathetic as well as Lange's heroine feeling for the poor doomed creature.

A lot of people are saying what a disaster this movie was, but if I remember correctly, it did extremely well at the box-office. It even made the cover of Time magazine. It is unfortunate that most of the people that watch it are looking for flaws in it. This movie has amazing special effects for it's time, and in my opinion compares favorably to the original.

		<shortDescription>KING KONG : The Weakest Version Still Has Enough Heart To Carry It Through...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KING KONG (1976) When I first saw this film in the late 80's, I was in awe of how real the giant beast appeared. Gone was the obvious claymation and now what appeared before me was an ape that could actually move and interact with living actors. At the time, I was 9 years old. Now I am 23, and for various reasons I have come to realize that the 1976 version of KING KONG is clearly the weakest of the three adaptations. However, it does bring a level of heart and feeling to the story that was missed in the original version.The original KING KONG portrayed the giant ape as little more then a dangerous beast. After capturing his beauty Ann Darrow, little was done to humanize the monster. This time around, the character of Kong becomes a living, breathing creature with feelings (both sexual and friendly). Aside from giving the ape more subtext, the 1976 changes the time period and original mission of the crew. Instead of setting off to shoot a movie, the original objective of Fred Walker (played by Charles Grodin) is to set off for a remote island that will prove to be the best oil reserve in the world. Also on board the ship is Jack Prescott (played by Jeff Bridges), an environmental missionary out to explore the new world and see if rumors he's heard of a fantastic creature on the island are true. While headed toward the island, the crew picks up Dwan (Jessica Lange in her film debut), the only survivor from a massive shipwreck. Aside from these changes, the story is very familiar. They arrive on the island, meet the unfriendly natives, Dwan gets captured by Kong, and everyone sets off to rescue her.Unfortunately, everything that impressed me so much when I was 9 is now dated and far from awe-inspiring... and the advancement of technology exposes certain flaws in the 1976 De Laurentis version that might not have been so apparent in the past. The film seems to have wasted so much money on their trick shots and special effects that they forgot to infuse everything with a visual style. While the 1933 original's special effects are no longer cutting edge, the film as a whole embraces the special effects and stylizes them in a way so that they never feel dated. KING KONG ('76) simply displays the special effects without the slightest artistic integrity. This is special effects showboating w/o artistic infusion... and as a result the film can't escape the "dated" label.However, on the flip side, now that the films special effects are less distracting, it's easier to see some of the more subtle qualities in this version. The original KING KONG was happy to only tell the first half of it's "Beauty &amp; The Beast" tale, the half in which Beauty never stops fearing the Beast. The 1976 version goes on to tell the full emotional tale of "Beauty &amp; The Beast". For the first time we see a genuine bond and appreciation between Dwan and Kong. Slowly Dwan realizes how pure Kong's heart is, and she sees him as a well-intentioned victim once he's shipped over to New York for all to make money off of.Also, despite a high camp factor, the film manages to have its moments. For example, the sacrifice scene in which Dwan is hypnotized by the gyrations of the natives is arguably the most interesting of the three versions. Other scenes that really help to strengthen the emotional bond between Kong and Dwan take place on the journey home to New York. While both the original version and the 2005 remake decided to jump straight from Skull Island back to New York, this film examines the changes that take place in its leading characters during this transitional time.It's impossible for me to see the 70's KING KONG as anything more then the weakest of three interesting films. But the story of KING KONG is one that has fascinated me every time. Just like with the original and the newest version, I can watch this film over and over, year after year. What I can especially appreciate in this version is it's emphasis on compassion and creating a bond between man and ape. Unfortunately, in it's efforts to do so it loses some of the excitement and adrenaline that the original had. Thankfully, we have the 2005 version to perfectly blend the best qualities of the previous versions into one thrilling masterpiece! ... B- ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong of 1976</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kong is back and mad as ever. Director John Guillermin and Paramount recreate the dramatic and horrifying story of Kong the giant gorilla, that was first produced in 1933. Kong is once again terrorizing "The Big Apple," but this time in color. Guillerman keeps the plot the same but with a twist. One of the many main characters, Fred Wilson leader of the expedition, finds himself searching for crude oil to hit it big with the "Petrox" company. Little does he know what awaits him on the thought to be uninhibited island. Actress Jessica Lange does a marvelous job portraying Dwan, the beautiful love of Kong. Paleontologist Jack Prescott tags along in search of something incredible never seen by a "white" man. Guillermin did not want to take away from the films basic storyline; he just wanted to add some new scenes and ideas. King Kong, for the time period, is shown with awesome special effects and outstanding camera shots. This film is truly a great work of art and a must see movie for all types of audiences. Viewers will get to see all types of genres including adventure, comedy, romance, fantasy, thriller, and horror. Personally, I rate this motion picture as one of all time leaders in all aspects of the twentieth century film industry.</fullReview>

Jeff bridges does a decent job, although the effects are pretty cheesy. hey, before digital effects they needed to rely on creativity. the twin towers also add a pretty epic dimension to the film. it's worth checking out. i saw clips from peter Jackson's new version and it looks a bit over-produced and digital. the dinosaurs, creatures, etc don't look great.This movie is violent, too. Kong is pretty rough on new yorkers, tossing a few around and wrecking subways, etc. Rick Baker did the make-up and he's the best actor in it.</fullReview>

Because of this, I only knew to like this version of the big ape. You have to credit them with how believable Kong was this time around with perfect facial motion for the Kong costume and very well made miniatures. And the costume not fooling anybody? I'd really like to be enlightened about stop-motions ability to fool. Bridges did a splendid job, and his role suited the hippy age, still very fresh in everyone's mind at the time. Lange did well with what she was given in her first big role, but I didn't think it was the best idea to have her as the airhead. I liked Grodin as the meglomaniacal tycoon trying to add depth to his pocket. The thing is I don't think anybody will ever be able to watch this one the same after 9-11.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has everything: a tried &amp; tested plot, some good special effects (for the time), some decent acting, a lovely lead couple (Jeff Bridges &amp; Jessica Lange), some heart-wrenchingly romantic music (especially the main theme), and the ability to make the viewers want to believe the story. I think this film is heavily under-rated. People are so quick nowadays to label colour remakes as poor bastardisations of the original "classics". I haven't seen the original, but it doesn't matter: this is a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Major Entertainer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 1933 classic King Kong, about how a giant ape is captured and imported to New York City for exhibition, John Guillermin's 'King Kong' is a major entertainer... that delivers the best of Special Effects for it's time.1976 made guilty pleasure in 'King Kong', the viewers were intact with this famous hit about a giant ape. Cult-Filmmaker Peter Jackson, made a far-superior entertainer of the same story and name in 2005, which was also a hit. I enjoyed this film, because it tapped the talent it got. Guillmin's direction is of top order, Richard H. Kline's Camera-Work is great.Acting wise, Jeff Bridges is fantastic, the legendary actor excels in every role! Jessica Lange, again a terrific performer, does very well in her Debut Film. Charles Grodin is excellent.on the whole, 'King Kong' deserves a watch, it's truly something from the 70's. I had my guilty pleasure, I am sure so will you! Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This 1976 version provides a morality play for the ethics and ecology movements.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A trilogy of films titled King Kong span the history of sound film making. The first, released in 1933 just after the introduction of talkies set new standards for both monster films and dramatic special effects sequences - so much so that it has become an unquestioned classic which still sells well on DVD and is listed as 'essential viewing' for most College film courses. All three films tell essentially the same story, but by Peter Jackson's 2005 version its duration had doubled from 100 min. to 200 min. What makes this trilogy so unique is the 30 year intervals between the successive films, which means all three use completely different technologies for creating their special effects, even though the stories presented vary very little. A comment elsewhere on this database notes another very significant feature they share. Apparently, when correction is made for the changing value of the dollar, all three had roughly comparable budgets and all three achieved comparable modest commercial success - this seems to point to the fact that the quality of the film was not a major factor in its appeal to prospective viewers, each film was supported by a similar proportion of the movie going audience presumably electing to see it primarily on the basis of its story. Such similarities make it particularly difficult to discuss any of these films in isolation, but I felt the 1976 film was on balance the most satisfactory to watch - the exact converse of the assessment made by most critics and other IMDb database users. I am prejudiced against remakes of well respected classic films, particularly where the remake 'pirates' the story of the original too closely, and will therefore attempt to explain this preference.Great film-making earned the original version its place as an essential film for students - I can re-watch it repeatedly, but only to admire and enjoy the craftsmanship with which it was created, not its story. All three films share this by now famous story about an isolated tribe of savages who periodically sacrifice one of their young maidens, tied to some fancy timber altar and offered to a gigantic mountain gorilla like creature they worship. They capture a white girl from a ship for the same purpose. The monster takes a fancy to this new offering, grasping her in its hand and protecting her fiercely. Eventually the ship's crew rescue her and capture the monster which is taken back to New York for public exhibition - it escapes and climbs a skyscraper on top of which it is killed by gunfire from aeroplanes. This choice of monster - not a mutation, alien or some primeval slime but a gorilla - provides a firm and welcome link with reality. Gorillas are the most totally vegetarian large primate - they are also unusually gentle and even lovable creatures (Watch "Gorillas in The Mist"). The story as written by Cooper in 1933 may have been inspired by a powerful but very brief sequence in Demille's 1932 "The Sign of the Cross" which showed a Christian girl tied to a stake in the Roman Arena in a very similar way waiting to be ravaged by a silverback gorilla. But there is no way in which a 30 foot monster could attempt to sexually ravage a normal size girl so Cooper's film abandoned everything known about the natural history of gorillas by implying that the native maidens offered to the monster were all killed. It even featured an introductory prophecy to the effect that the moment the monster shows pity and fails to kill its victim it becomes doomed itself. Later, at the point where the viewer is left wondering where such an oversize monster could have come from, whether Skull Island could support a breeding population and how many like King Kong could exist, other greater travesties of acceptability follow. Long extinct creatures from the dinosaur era appear, leading to dramatic battles in which King Kong defends his new toy from tyrannosaurus like creatures extinct long before any mammals larger than a rodent had evolved. Presented in this way, it is hard to recognise the filmscript as that of a classic work, however brilliant the visual sequences created. The film's ultimate success is largely due to its final sequences featuring the death of King Kong on the Empire State building in New York. These emphasise his near human qualities and engender the sympathy that he could never command as King of the Jungle.My preference for the 1976 film arises partly because the ship here is exploring for oil, not carrying a filming expedition. This expands the story to become a parable extolling the significance of understanding and affection over empty corporate greed measuring everything only by its dollar value. Made in colour (almost essential for many modern filmgoers), it very wisely eliminates the totally incompatible Mesozoic sequences featuring dinosaurs - the only hint of other forms of savage life on Skull island comes when a snake similar in appearance to an Anaconda attacks Kong's new toy and arouses his ire. Most important, the monkey suit worn by Rick Baker when playing King Kong had lenses in the eye sockets through which his own eyes were seen. The King's soulful eyes give the impression of being able to look into his mind as he faces his various achievements and failures - a film-makers triumph which for me raises this film above either of the alternatives. Admittedly Peter Jackson's 2005 film features CGI sequences with visual appeal dwarfing anything in the two earlier films. Unfortunately in the process the coherent story is lost, largely because its duration becomes twice what can be supported. It resembles a child's scrapbook, full of colourful and dramatic but unrelated imagery that provides little to take away with one after viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While far from being a classic, this is still not nearly as bad as everyone says. Yes it does have its campy moments but overall is mostly played straight. Is this film dated? Yes, and twenty years from now so will every film that was made in 2002. While far from being a cerebral movie, the script by Lorenzo Semple Jr. is far more smarter and wittier than most of todays soulless big budget monster on the loose flicks ie. Independence Day, Godzilla 1998. Compared to silly big budget fodder like Starship Troopers or Armagheddon, Kong 76 is Citizen Cane. Has anyone here seen the three hour version of this film that was originally broadcast on NBC in the seventies and early eighties. This is the version that I basically grew up with. When watching the film some years later on video tape I was disappointed to find that many scenes I knew were no longer there. I recently acquired a copy of this rare version on video. Overall I think a good deal of this footage helps out the movie. The battle with the snake is much longer and actually a bit more violent. The snake while still not the most realistic looking creature is at least a bit more menacing appearing. Overall I give the remake of King Kong seven out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this as a 6 year old when it was first shown on Australian TV in 1978 as a mini-series, so I thought that maybe I was viewing this film through rose-tinted glasses...But I watched this again very recently, and found it to be one of the BEST giant monster films ever made. OKay, so it isn't as good as the original, but then, no giant monster movie is...This movie IS, however, so much better than ANY Godzilla movie (including the awful King Kong Vs Godzilla).Okay, sure, its camp, and sure, it isn't the greatest motion picture in the history of film...But it is entertaining. Whether its the laugh factor (some of the special effects are silly while some things that this Kong does are damn right human rather than ape like), or whether its the 70's take on a classic film, this movie IS worth watching. Its not a movie Id watch over and over again, perhaps once every year or two, but it is worth watching more than once, even if it is just to pick it to pieces.Its a time capsule from the 1970's, but its more than this...Its damn good entertainment.People seem to condemn this King Kong to the 'Ed Wood' scene, when it is anything but. The main character, the giant ape, actually has a heart, and his character is built up so much that in the final scenes with Kong fighting for his life atop the World Trade Center I found myself praying that THIS Kong would survive (of course, we find out, ten years later in 1986 that he actually did survive), and when he falls from the twin towers my heart breaks almost every time.Personally, I think this 1976 version of King Kong is better than the 2005 version in one way, it is its own entity that really only shares the name and title character from the original. I do love the 2005 version, almost as much as I love the 1933 version, but the 1976 movie is, for me, on an even footing with the 1933 version...There, I've said it. I enjoyed the 1976 version as much as I did the 1933 original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Kong (1976) is a great remake but not near as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have made it clear that I've been a huge Kong fan nearly my whole life. I always tried to avoid this remake knowing that it could very well ruin the original for me and possibly even spoil my love for the King Kong movies. I owned the first three Kong films on VHS (King Kong, Son of Kong, and Kong Kong Vs. Godzilla) and never really considered this part of the series and decided it was just a rehash to be avoided. But one time my mom told me that this film was deeper than the '33 original and made you actually cry when King Kong died.She thought this movie was better! Now I know that wasn't true but I took my mom's advice and checked this movie out when it came on TV a few years ago. I wasn't blown away but I must say I really enjoyed it and had a great action/drama/romance roller-coaster with this fun movie. This movie did have better action and emotion than the original (I actually did get sad when Kong died as I never did before, there I said it!) but I just lacked something. The absence of the dinosaurs was a major downfall and the realistic take on the character was something I never liked as even though he looked more like a giant gorilla than the old Kong, he wasn't even half as fun to watch. There were things about this movie I liked better than the original but when it all adds up, there is no comparison. King Kong '33 wins by a long shot. It is hard I might add not to compare the two films but even as a stand alone movie, this 70s remake was not completely what I wanted. The new characters were actually modern versions of the old ones just with different names (Jack Driscoll-Jack Prescott, Carl Denham- Fred Wilson, Ann Darrow-Dwan and so on) and I appreciated them on a certain level although this version of Carl/Fred was more sleazy and all I saw was his jerk side. He deserved being flattened by Kong's foot. Jessica Lange was better eye candy then Fay Wray and made for an intriguing love interest to Kong. She also brought the whole beauty and the beast/his love for women is his downfall theme to a slightly greater level. Everyone did their part well but my favorite was Jeff Bridges as Jack Prescott. He was a true heroic nature lover and the exact opposite of Fred Wilson I just bought it on DVD today along with King Kong Lives (1986) and added them to my collection of Kong Kong DVDs (King Kong Vs. Godzilla and King Escapes will be joining them in four days!). In all fairness, King Kong '76 is definitely a worthy entry to the huge Kong series and has remained one of my favorites for some time now. Can't wait to see the second remake of King Kong in a month, it will be the motion picture event of the year for me and probably a lot better than this movie (but not the '33 original). King Kong '76 is a great remake but not as good as the original! I give this great attempt at a modernization of a classic tale an 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film deserves it's props. It was great to see Kong in water and have him climb (almost brand new at the time) WTC. The only thing I did not like at all was the lack of fight scenes with Kong and other animals. Many people can't get the concept of "WILLFULL SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF". Also KING KONG LIVES with Linda Hamilton (1987) is worth a look because it deals with Kong in great depth. As for this one Jessica Lang is smoking and Charles Grodin is an annoying weasel as always. The acting could have been better, but Kongs fury is definitely felt. He sure was angry when he chucked the girl from the train after finding out it was not Lang.</fullReview>

Of course, it is not an animation movie like the first one and in some scene a man was used for king kong ... But only the results only the result countsAdd a good musical score of John Barry, and marvellous actor like Jessica Lange (which i find better than Fay Wray) and Jeff Bridges who is perfect...The quality of the dvd zone 1 is good (image : 3/5 ; sound : 4/5) and allows us to appreciate the marvellous landscapes and a sublime musical score.A movie i recommend ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Under-appreciated Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Guillermin's interpretation of "King Kong" was unnecessarily written off by most critics as a monumental misstep upon its 1976 release and has been pretty much ignored ever since. This is the Jan Brady of Kong films. Nestled between the iconic 1933 original and Peter Jackson's hugely acclaimed recent remake Guillermin's version somehow got lost in the mix, which is unfortunate because this is my favourite of the three. King Kong circa 1976 has an edge the others are lacking. It's bloodier, gorier and sexier than the other two versions put together.One of the main criticisms levelled at the film is that it takes unnecessary liberties with the original plot. This is an entire re-imagining. Unlike Peter Jackson's faithful remake, Guillermin's Kong is set in the then modern day 1970s and features a plot about a greedy oil company rather than a film crew. The male star is now a stowaway Science Professor, while the female lead is a wannabe starlet found adrift in a life raft. Personally, I think the changes make the film. The hunger for oil regardless of the cost is thematically more relevant than ever and the film's surprisingly strong environmental message is refreshing.As the leads, Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange make a strikingly attractive pair. Jeff was at the height of his career and delivers a typically solid performance. This was Jessica's big break and I think she does a good job with a difficult role. Jessica looks every inch the movie star and brings her own unique sense of frailty to the role but her character is somewhat undermined by the writing. I'm sure Fay Wray and Naomi Watts would have struggled just as much with the seedier elements of the film.The undisputed star of the film, however, is Kong. The thing I love most about this film is its reliance on animatronics (and a couple of monkey suits) instead of CGI. Carlo Rambaldi's life sized mechanical Kong is the thing of legend. The detail in Kong's giant hand alone is magnificent. The computer generated special effects, on the other hand, haven't aged well at all. The best thing about this version is the producers' willingness to make Kong a killer. I love the bloody battle with the giant rubber snake and Kong's memorable tantrum involving a giant log. My favourite part is when Kong tramples innocent bystanders in New York. It's 70s exploitation at its best ? as are the decidedly disturbing scenes where Kong washes and dried Dwan (Jessica Lange) and the infamous moment when he exposes her breasts. It's wonderfully tasteless and so of its time. Just like Dwan's story of being rescued by "Deep Throat"! Another interesting aspect of the film is using the World Trade Center instead of the Empire State Building for the finale. It is a bit disturbing to see the Twin Towers feature so prominently but it's also touching to see them in all their former majestic glory. Their use makes the film a true historical document. The finale itself is utterly brilliant. In fact, the entire New York sequence is tense and spectacular. Guillermin's "King Kong" has its flaws but it has the balls to be different and offers a whole new spin on the Kong legend. The film is definitely undervalued and under-appreciated. Watch it for Kong's horny eyes alone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen better remakes in my time. Back in 1976, "King Kong" looked fun. Now 30 years later, it's a totally different story. This Kong here is bi-pedal. Nothing more than a man in a gorilla suit. Just as ferocious as the 1933 version, only a a lot of change were made there. I did take notice that they blurred Jessica Lange's areolas in the movie. Very discreet of the people there. And this Kong was a bigger horn-dog primate than the original version. There were no other creatures in the remake, only the big snake. And that scene, was a bit too short for me. That snake didn't stand a chance when Kong popped it. The cast in the movie were indeed great. Charles Grodin as the greedy oil magnet, Jeff Bridges, was the most level-headed one in the movie. And Jessica Lange in her debut, did a spectacular job playing Dwan. Though I was living in New York at the time, I would worry about Kong heading around Long Island. Of Course, who would come here? There's nothing more than houses and a few parks. Then it would be total pandemonium! This movie was all right, not the greatest remake now, but back then, it was. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Kong is Rick Baker in a life-like gorilla suit that has expression, and beats the Japanese Kong. The only scenes that are a homage to the original are:the native dancer with a simian maskthe monster snake (homage to the Elasmosaur fight in the original)when Lange mentions the Empire State BuildingKong attacking the trainKong on the twin towers fighting the helicopters and falling to his deaththe logI would say that this film is an OK movie. I love the special effects. (I don't care that they suck, IT ROCKS!)There were international versions of it a year later. QUEEN KONG doesn't count as a spoof of the remake (especially A*P*E*).I never got to see the movie until the summer of 1999. It was good 70's stuff.You know why I am commenting on a film like this on Firday September 13th 2002. It is because the WTC took a major role in the remake. I feel a bit teary about that. Now people are digitally erasing the WTC in classic movies as SUPERMAN II, and 2002's SPIDERMAN. I thought to myself, good grief, now they're going to make a new scene on the Empire State. Or even worse stop selling it. But I was wrong! Maybe they left it there because it is such valueable eye-candy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the classic 1933 film has a special place in my heart because when I was seven, this was really the first big event film of my life. All the bubble gum cards and media fanfare. As a result, my childlike eyes saw the movie more favorably than the critics did.Now that I'm older and wiser, I know better about some things. Of course the original is a superior adventure film and a deserved classic and the remake has some clunky dialogue and some utterly silly characters (Jeff Bridges' Presscott character, a 1960s hippie, already seemed behind the times in 1976 and really comes across the silliest today). OTOH, the film is not an embarrassment. It has some breathtaking cinematography of both Hawaii (the stand-in for Skull Island) and New York City (capturing perfectly the New York I first experienced as a child), a terrific John Barry score and some reasonably good action that holds up the entire length of the film (and Rene Auberjoinois totally steals the picture with his one line, "You'll get better mileage filling your Cadillac with mulep***.")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie that I had not watched since about fifteen years, is a perfect example of "what do you try to do after that ?", even so from one of the most unbelievable plots to make a film with."King Kong 76" change it into a sumptuous and bewitching story, where nothing fall down among humour, feeling or "gigantism" you can find in. Well, excepting this enormous "arm" build to give most realistic sequences, you can see that FX had not really grown up since the year 1933. Many of us must understand however that it's enough with a bit of imagination, to enjoy when most of movies nowadays, in spite of "high technology", have no soul anymore... The expressions of Kong make me think about Rawhead Rex's face, where the "grotesque" take perfectly to the best fear. Feelings are also the best "conductor" towards frightening, and "King 76" has succeed to develop a large range of them, until the death of the monster, which can make tearful the most insensitive of us. At least, make me so...Let's now discuss about the score, this music that give a half-part of their attraction to movies like "Alien", "The thing", "Jaws", and overall "Bloody Bird" or "Slaughter high" B others... John Barry's score on this one make you almost regret that this man has "wasted" his talent in Bond's films which still stay "teenager's movies". Only "Thunderball" approached of what Barry did for "76", where his genius of orchestration and heavy dark chords give the complete atmosphere of the movie in such sequences like the "dry" of the girl in Kong's hand, by the warm and powerful breath of the monster... I think composer was inspired, as perhaps the all crew, and as the monster, to realize such a perfect product to my view, by Jessica Lange's charm and INCREDIBLE LEGS which where perfect to be seen by such a big monkey. Would you imagine frail Sharon Stone playing with Kong ?...Don't try to make another after this one or you take risk as did the first one, to be ridiculous. You're informed...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXCELLENT REVISION OF THE GIANT APE STORY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW! Okay, bear (or ape) with me, and let's get some facts over with. This version of King Kong has the ape played by a man in a suit. The original King Kong was an obvious claymation puppet. And Peter Jackson's version is almost guaranteed to be cgi effects (which I've never ever ever found to be convincing). When you go to see a movie, if you've got a brain, you know what you're going to see is special effects and not real. Until movie companies bio-engineer a giant ape, King Kong will always going to look fake. So what? If you're going to see this type of movie, that's what you accept and love. On to the main squeeze. Fay Wray couldn't act worth a lick, all she did was scream the entire movie, which is extremely irritating. Jessica Lange plays an air-head with skill, and she looks delicious (still!). To be frank, I've always found the original King Kong to be painfully boring. This is not the case with this version. The plot is good and the actors do superb jobs- especially Jeff Bridges. One major thing that's lost on this KK is the theater experience, back when movies were actually shown on screen that were bigger than a big screen TV, this movie was phenomenal. Seeing a big ape on a big screen is something I will never forget. So, on video and dvd it does lose that part. But, it still holds its own. The real monster in this movie is not King Kong, but human greed and amibition. This is ever so clear, I don't know how most reviewers here missed it. The end scene where the reporters are literally swarming over Kong's carcass like flies is profound. As is when they assault Dwan with ferocity, who only wanted fame and now she's got it in all its ugliness. I'll tell you something else: when I first heard of the twin towers being destroyed by terrorists, I immediately thought of this movie and dismally pondered, "I guess King Kong won't be climbing them anymore." This movie works on many levels, one of which is to serve as a time capsule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best If Seen Before Age Six</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie on TV when I was four or five and thinking it was the greatest thing I had ever seen. One scene really sticks in my memory: Kong has taken Jessica Lange to his mountain lair. He sets her down, she is promptly attacked by a huge snake, which Kong must then wrestle and kill by ripping its jaws apart. That scene scared me to death when I was little because it seemed so real.Years passed. I grew up, discovered the original King Kong, and fell in love with it. As a lark, I rented the remake, but when I got to that scene with the snake, I jumped up and started yelling "Fake!" That snake used to looked incredibly realistic -- now it looks like a rubber snake someone picked up at a discount toy store.I can forgive the attempt to update the story, and the characters. I can accept the trendy 1970s references. But the "special effects" here -- Rick Baker made an excellent ape suit, but it doesn't hold a candle to the magic of the stop-motion original. And that giant robot Kong they show for three seconds in the escape sequence -- almost as bad as that rubber snake.In the end, this movie does have a certain magic to it, but only for viewers who either very young or haven't experienced the wonder and horror of the original. If you're older than six, you should probably stay away. If you're younger than six, you probably aren't reading this anyway.</fullReview>

Just before the ship sets sail paleontologist Jack Prescot (Jeff Bridges) sneaks aboard in hope of studying the islands untouched wildlife. As they head for the island they discover a raft floating in the open sea &amp; pick up has been actress Dawn (Jessica Lange). Once on the island the initial landing party discover a primitive tribe who fear &amp; worship a god they call Kong &amp; they want to offer the pretty Dawn as a sacrifice, an idea which no-one is that keen about. That night back aboard the ship some natives kidnap Dawn, take her back to the island, chain her up &amp; leave her for Kong who turns out to be a 40 foot Gorilla. Kong takes a shine to Dawn &amp; carries her off, a rescue party is already on the island &amp; they must set out to try &amp; save Dawn from Kong &amp; whatever other horrors the island holds...Directed by John Guillermin I actually had a fair amount of fun with this usually hated remake of the original 1933 classic. The script by Lorenzo Semple Jr. moves like an absolute rocket &amp; at least is never dull or boring but at the same time it's rather camp &amp; silly. Would a 40 foot Gorilla really be able to avoid detection in Manhattan by simply hiding behind a skyscraper? Would a 40 foot Gorilla be able to 'sneak' up on someone? What are the chances of a small raft being found in the middle of the ocean? The odds must be astronomical! A fog bank that remains totally unchanged for 100's of years? Wouldn't the wind not affect it at all? It sticks to the originals basic story except that all the monsters &amp; dinosaurs are gone &amp; have been replaced by a rubber snake that looks like one of those draft excluder's that you place at the bottom of doors. This is one aspect of the original that is sorely missed in this remake. The character's are over-the-top but quite likable, Wilson as the annoying Petrox executive irritates though. I liked it as a piece of harmless entertaining fun although it can't really compare to the original.Director Guillermin does an OK job, apparently Roman Polanski, Michael Winner &amp; Sam Peckinpah were offered the chance to direct but turned it down, all I can say is I'd have loved to see what Michael Winner would have come up with! Now the special effects, well apparently Carlo Rambaldi built a 40 foot full sized mechanical Kong at a cost of $1.7 million but has about a minute of screen time &amp; it looks awful so Guillermin went with Rick Baker in a monkey suit &amp; the results variable to say the least. Each Kink Kong film had to work within limitations &amp; are a product of they're time, the original has stop motion animation that won't impress many these days, this one has a man in a rubber suit &amp; the recent remake has the nicest CGI effects you can get.With a healthy budget of about $25,000,000 King Kong is well made &amp; has that Hollywood polish to it although I'm not sure it deserved two Oscar nominations, the Hawaiian locations are nice &amp; the climax atop the World Trade Center has a strange feeling to it. The acting is OK but nothing spectacular.I know a lot of people dislike this remake, personally I'm judging it on it's own as I feel it's a completely separate film from the original or Peter Jacksons big budget remake. If you prefer the original to this than fine watch that, &amp; I have to say now I'm a huge fan of it, as no-one is forcing you to watch or like this. Good fun &amp; provides a couple of hours of entertainment &amp; thats all I want in a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does everybody think that this movie sucks? I would say, that for 1976, King Kong is the best movie ever. Making a movie like that in 1976, is equal to making a movie with The Godfather 1, and 2, plus Rambo, plus all of the King Kongs ever made, and Top Gun in 2005. The way that the movie built up to it's action, and dramatized parts is amazing. The acting was alright, but in a movie like that it doesn't matter. I just think that the scripts for characters wasn't well written, and it was a kind of corny ending. Even though the ending was kind of corny, the way King Kong died was so sad, and dramatic. Also the way that he wanted to protect the girl, and how he died trying was unbelievably sad. I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: King Kong (1976)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is as old as I am, but it's not the original. Yes you heard me right. The original big gorilla debut in 1933. and this is a remake. Unless you've been residing in Mars, you'll also know that Peter Jackson will be adapting King Kong for the big screen for a release next month, and thank heavens it's closely based on the original.While this film also adapts from the same source material by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace, it has taken certain liberties and artistic license to change some character backgrounds and premise. For example, the film crew has been replaced with oil prospectors, and the blonde lass doesn't start off the journey with the team, but actually plucked out unconscious from the sea, an actress wannabe who didn't enjoy Deep Throat (don't ask). Gone too is the iconic scene atop the Empire States Building, now Kong scales the World Trade Center and hops between the two towers (alas, September 11 changed it all).However, this movie still retained much of the story's structure - team ventures into island, chances upon island inhabitants, inhabitants kidnap blonde lass as a sacrifice to the great Kong, the beauty and the beast sequence, the capture of Kong, bringing him back to New York, and all hell breaks loose.Just not quite. This Kong is quite benign in nature, and only goes berserk when jealousy makes him go on a rampage against those trying to prise his lass away from him. The effects look dated if you watch them today, and the animatronics probably made a giant ape hand - that's the only mechanical limb you get to see up close, the rest can be figured as a man in a rubber suit, captured using various techniques to achieve the desired proportions for size. Don't go scrutinizing the plot too, as there are gaping loopholes, and plenty of minor characters. Oh, Singapore's mentioned a lot of times in the first twenty minutes, as the ship crew navigates from Surabaya, Indonesia en route to looking for oil.Starring a very young and very hairy Jeff Bridges in the role of a professor / ape expert, this movie is probably famous for introducing a very nubile Jessica Lange in her first feature film. She could be considered as the Jessica Simpson of that era, having prancing around the island in hot pants and tank tops, various strapless gowns and in wet island garb, which gave way to a wardrobe malfunction when Kong molested her with its finger (don't ask - the ape's probably horny too).So while awaiting Peter Jackson's masterpiece, why not get your hands on this adapted classic too? Good for compare, contrast, but don't go bananas over this one if it doesn't meet your expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few facts..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, so many of the reviews here are based on story, special effects and lame acting! Well, to some degree, I agree! The story is simple and easily predictable. The special effects are almost as bad as the japanese Godzilla movies! The acting really isn't bad. Each character is played to perfection by the actor.But the REAL REASON I love this movie is Jessica Lange! No where have I seen beauty as incredible as hers! Her cleavage shots are magnificent especially in this age of fake implants, she was as real as they get! And she had the most exquisite legs I have ever seen! She exudes an sexuality and innocence that belies a smoldering sensuality that could wake a dead man! She has an aire of Marilyn Monroe in her for sure! My pulse speeded up whenever she was onscreen, especially the beginning shots of her on the beach in her "Daisy Dukes". I can see why Kong was so possessed by her beauty!One other note is many of the reviewers here think that the ape was merely a man in a gorilla suit. That is partially true but not entirely. I worked on the set of Delaurentis Studios in Wilmington, NC back in 1990-91 and I remember seeing the ape head used in the movie lying in the back lot in a open field with alot of other props and junk used in various movies. It was a faded purple color from all the years of fading in the sun. It was kind of sad. I was told that in the movie, that the closeup scenes of Kong where he is looking at Jessica Lange the studio used a robotic controlled ape. You can tell this is true by the large eyes and how close together they are and how the facial expressions are mechanical from the blinking eyes to the jaw movements. Also the hand is mechanical in the scenes wher Jessica is in his palm. The scenes where he is running are a man in a suit as many have said. And that ape face is different. That is why they look so different, because they are 2 different masks.Even though a new Kong is coming out in 2005, I doubt it will be worthy. Will it capture the beauty and innocence of Jessica Langes character? Somehow I feel it will be mostly CGI crap, much like what was used in Hulk, and we know how that turned out!!!!! It's not a bad movie nor is it great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film (No thats not right) The Best Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all those out there who still love the Classic 1933 version... Its time to wake up KING KONG 1976 is far better than the original in both quality and acting the script is far better the plot makes sence and John Gulliermin is a genius film maker. The film along with John Barrys score is 100% quality and i personally can not find one thing wrong with the production. All the characters are fully rounded and none have been miss-cast.The film was never a flop as it has been referred to outgrossing the oscar winning Rocky easily. The films only downfall is that at the time of its release the critics of the time (Whom like most reveiwers today) were still in love with the original. Learn to let things go and watch this film the way it should be. A stand alone production with no connection to the original.For further reading i suggest you read The Creation of Dino De Luarentiis King Kong, it gives you a real insight into the production and makes you enjoy the film for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers below!King Kong never quite reaches the high water mark the original 1933 movie did, but it is quite good on its own merits. The special effects of the guy in the ape suit are not spectacular as others have mentioned, but are fairly well done and by 1976 standards quite good. The acting is also good, especially the debut of a young Jessica Lange. One drawback of the movie is that it takes a rather liberal slant, and while this in itself is not a bad thing it would have played better in 1968 than in 1976. Jack Prescott is basically a hippie who just happens to be a scientist; he seems outdated in a film in the mid-1970s. Grodin plays the leader of the expedition, and comes across as more dangerous than King Kong in his ruthless quest to find oil. The liberal, questioning tone does not damage the film that much, but it does make it a little less fun than the original.A lot of things are copied from the original 1933 King Kong, however; not only the plot line itself but some smaller points as well. Jessica Lange and Fay Wray both portray down on their luck actresses who end up on the ship mostly by luck or fate; when kidnapped by the natives off the ship, both rip a necklace from one of warriors which leads to the sailors going ashore to rescue them. Both the original Kong and the 1976 version shake exactly four sailors off a log bridge in the jungle. There are many other similarities as well, and it is interesting to watch both versions of the film to find them.While not close to being the classic the original film was, the 1976 version of King Kong is definitely worth watching. When you realize that it is not trying to top the 1933 film, you'll relax and enjoy it for its own good points.</fullReview>

I was very surprised to see that Jessica Lange nailed a Golden Globe for her performance. It was great considering it was a remake and it was made in the 70's. The story line was better than the original, but the whole "mysterious island" shrouded in fog seem way off base to me. Now that I am 33 anyway. Boy, she was a nice piece back then. What the hell happened to her? Grodin was great too. He has sure turned out to be majorly lame. Should have stuck with acting Charles. Your talk show bites the big one.

		<shortDescription>entertaining hokum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviews revile this remake, one criticising the fact that it was obviously a man inside the gorilla suit. Well, I guess it's not too easy to get a gorilla to act the range of emotions demonstrated by this Kong, and in 1976 special-effects technology wasn't advanced enough to do so instead. As it happens, the gorilla's facial emotions (albeit mechanically-arranged) are more accomplished than those of some of the human characters, not least the expedition boss played by Charles Grodin.It's hokum, of course, but entertainingly so. The problem is that for the middle part of the film Kong is portrayed as a sexual threat. He even pulls down the front of Jessia Lange's sacrificial outfit, and one white man speculates that she might have been raped. Though Kong's mid-region is tactfully nebulous, this would have been physically impossible - like a human having sex with a hamster. For the sexual subtext to have convinced, Kong would have needed to be little larger than your average gorilla, hence nullifying his value as a captive trophy and making it impossible for him to cause so much mayhem in New York.Lange herself is certainly an eye-catcher, and it is interesting to see that her make-up survived her shipwreck. (One might also note that she remains remarkably unscathed after being clutched in Kong's paw as he clambers around his island and up the World Trade Centre.) When seen in 2005 the film struck some resonance: the "attack" on the World Trade Centre, the reference to a fuel crisis, and the unsympathetic portrayal of an oil company eager to exploit an oil find with scant regard for the local population. For these reasons this version may earn itself a short paragraph in any study of how the cinema has reflected recent history.Most films of this type - such as The Lost World and The Land that Time Forgot - also fall in the hokum category, and among them King Kong compares well enough. There's some impressive scenery and only one glaringly-evident "outdoor" scene obviously filmed in a studio, when a rescue party tries to cross a ravine.But no aspect of the film places it in the Oscar category.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the 1930s classic is great. It is entertaining, engrossing, and so classic you have to love it. It is fast paced too, which is something most remakes aren't. The new King Kong is packed with all new twists and turns, it never stops because something is always going on, even if you've seen the original, you never know whats going to happen next. The finale in New York is very well done and very surprising. The Oscar winning special effects are excellent, and then again in some scenes they're not. But hey it is a 70s movie, and for the time they're great in this movie. The acting was another great feature, Grodin and Bridges are excellent as usual, but it was newcomer Lange who really gave her and the picture it's fame. She is gorgeous, and plays the role of Dwan better the Fay Wray did, it also earned her her first Golden Globe for her first movie. Believe me this King Kong is a whole lotta fun from beginning to end. Don't listen to the critics go rent it. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See this 3rd most famous King Kong as pure campy romp, tongue in cheek!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong (1976)There are a lot of ways to watch a King Kong movie that owes so much to that first 1933 version. And most of them will bring this 1976 version, the "Jessica Lange version," up short.But a certain attitude will help--this is a purposely campy movie. By camp I mean a deliberate exaggeration so that the stereotypes and clichés play out as a kind of ongoing laugh. If you click into that you'll rather like this monstrosity of a movie. And this isn't just making the most of some crappy movie-making--there are lots of cues toward camp, beginning with the atrociously overacting acting and ending with the graphic match cut of the World Trade Center with some Kong-land rocks. Between these two is a weird sexual encounter between Lange and the ape and a giant gasoline pump as a patriotic animal cage cover. There is no way to take this movie seriously--so don't.In its defense there is also a kind of inventive intention here, simply to make the King Kong story contemporary, which in this case means the 1970s oil crisis slick disco era. Remember, "Saturday Night Live" was the next year, and it will be five whole years before the more outrageously funny "Airplane" that takes exaggeration to new heights. Some liberties are allowed the writers, such as an island that somehow still evaded satellite discovery because of permanent cloud cover, but then it's a step by step echo of the original. I hope it doesn't give too much away to say that the climax doesn't occur on the Empire State Building but a bit further downtown at another iconic skyscraper site. That alone should appeal to many.One big disappointment? The filming itself. This is an era where the camera work could rather easily have made the most of the fantasy scenes on the island and the Kong on the loose scenes in New York. It comes to a disappointing peak n the final attack on the monster--with helicopters--that lacks visual excitement, replacing it with a surprising amount of blood packet gore. If there is one part of the film that doesn't lend itself to camp, it's the famous ending, and there is no redeeming energy. Just forced sadness.Lange is sort of terrific, despite the awkward shortcomings, even taking the movie for what it is. She plays a beautiful object beautifully, surely, but she is the one character who makes clear the humor in her exaggerations. The other actors being campy look more like bad actors, unfortunately. And the leading male, a scruffy Jeff Bridges, is a huge bore, perhaps the second biggest reason for the film falling flat in so many scenes.The biggest reason is the director, who has to take the rap for all the missed opportunities, for making an amazing ending dull, and for not sucking us into the ambitious sets and novel updating of the now-classic story. John Guillermin has directed more than his share of clinkers, including the apparently terrible sequel "King Kong Lives" which gets a whopping 3 stars out of 10 on this site. His most famous film, "The Blue Max," looks increasingly dated to my eyes, and it goes downhill from there. Which means that someone somewhere might do a contemporary twist on the original tale someday. The two other archetypal Kong movies include of course the original, which we might call the "Fay Ray version," which is amazingly good considering the limitations to it all. And there is a fairly recent version, the "Naomi Watts version," which avoid lots of problems by setting the movie back to 1933, and which has the most outrageous, over-the-top special effects with the monster. For sheer acting, Watts is the best of the three women, and because of her this latest version might be the most moving, though it is very long, even longer in the extended version. For originality and unmatched compact punch, head for the first one, the RKO breakthrough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honestly, I Think This Is The Best Kong Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A petroleum exploration expedition comes to an isolated island and encounters a colossal giant gorilla.While certainly one has to give credit to the original 1933 film, I actually think this one succeeds in ways that one did not. Sure, some of it is cheesy (the ape suit is not very believable), but it brings the film to modern times. The oil company angle was interesting, and the references to "Deep Throat" were, um, interesting...I know at the time there was a complaint that the Empire State Building was changed to the World Trade Center. Now, I guess there are two ways I can look at this. The part of me that prefers homages says that the Empire State Building was the only real proper choice. But now, seeing the film in 2011, I have to say that capturing the World Trade Center on film is a bit more historic -- though they could not have known that at the time.Oscar award-winning Jeff Bridges is excellent as always, here playing a liberal archaeologist or anthropologist or something like that. He seems to be a jack of all trades, smuggling himself on board and being useful at countless moments (and yes, his name is appropriately enough Jack). The hair and beard give him that "Dude" look, and I can never get enough of that.Last comment: Jessica Lange, what the heck? I have never before and will never again find her attractive. But here, she wins me over. And the rumor is that Barbra Streisand could have received the part? Yuck! Lange was the right choice, by far... and what a way to start a career.</fullReview>

But Jeff Bridges however, was superb as his role as a scientist/environmentalist who'll be very, I repeat, very angry if they kill Kong, which they sadly, in the end, do.The directors (including the one and only Dino De Laurietes)obviously realized from the start that they could not duplicate the spirit created in the original (another mistake Peter Jackson did) they decided to go for modern and replace it the Empire State Building with the World Trade center (which makes this Kong death a grim reminder of 9/11) and added more dark humor, but it's almost impossible impossible for being angry at them for leaving out the dinosaurs.</fullReview>

Charles Grodin is surprisingly good, and the Petrox oil survey pretext for visiting the island serves the story well, particularly considering when the movie was released (remember those gas lines?). And while full body shots of the bipedal guy in the suit are laughable, the head shots are remarkably effective because Kong's eyes and lids are real and thereby, soulful. Here this version has the original beat. Oh, and Fay Wray has nothing on Jessica Lang.Lastly, the haunting score is marvelous.Consider this a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given that this film was made in 1976, I thought it was a very good movie. Some of the visual effects were actually pretty good (maybe not compared to today's standards, but still good) and some of the shots must have been very complicated shots. The only complaint I have is the look of "Kong", mainly his face, it just didn't look right. Sometimes it looked pretty good, but other times I thought it just looked horrible. Also, there were a number of times that you could tell it was obviously just a man in a suite. This would be a great candidate for a remake with all the advances in special effects that we have today.As far as acting goes, I thought all the actors did a great job. It was really cool to see Jeff Bridges (who will be forever known as "The Dude" to me...from "The Big Lebowski" if you didn't know) in one of his first films. Jessica Lange looked absolutely incredible in this film, and did a fine job of acting. It was also cool to see Charles Grodin in one of his earlier films.All in all, I thought it was a pretty good film, and it's definitely something you should see if you're into the sci-fi genre, cause there are so many films that reference this film (and the original) that you may as well find out what their referencing. Anyhow, thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pales to the original, but is nostalgic in its own right...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>who'd ever thought this movie would become nostalgic, but in a way it has. the original is so classic that this remake always seemed simply: NOT AS GOOD!!! but time has passed, and with the CGI effects running rampant, it's nice to see a movie that relied on "human special effects". kong is a man in a costume, okay. but the movements within made by special effects maverick rick baker make him seem real enough - at least to garner some feeling for the poor doomed banana eater. and the model sets look pretty good too, especially of the giant wall surrouding the tribal village. for kong's size, and how he really seems bigger than everything else, it really gives you the impression, on the island scenes anyhow, that kong is definitly king. the first half of the movie is great. a terrific lead up. the boat journey is very entertaining. jeff bridges gives an awesomely eerie speech to the sailors and to the main bad guy, an oil monger played by the classic charles grodin, about the legend of the island that they are about to embark. and jessica lange - by LORD!!! she was, at that time, the prettiest woman ever; and a great actress too. playing an airhead isnt as easy as it seems; that is, a lesser actress would seem all to fitting in this role, making people think: "She's not a good actress, she's just being herself." lange brings out the damsel in distress very nicely. she's more of a loose modern woman than faye wray - that is, she's somewhat of a loose lucy - but then again it was made in the liberal 70's as opposed to 1933. &amp; speaking of the 70s, some dating shows here since jeff bridges is an environmentalist hippie type. his long hair and beard makes him look like a warewolf in that about-to-change-into-a-moon-crooner transitional stage. (if you wanted to see his hippie character Lebowski from THE BIG LEBOWSKI as a young man, this movie is worth viewing) but he's very good in the role and quite believable, and that whole environmental slant works well with the plot. charles grodin is hilarious. sure he's the bad guy, but for the first hour you cant help but to like him. his dead pan delivery is great, as usual. he brings a fine mellow likeableness to the bad guy role. there's some funny lines too, made for audiences at that time who, sitting in the theater, anticipating the giant ape, know exactly what's to come. grodin, when he gets out of the small boat onto the island says, "We might get eaten alive here", then turns to his friend and says, "Bring the mosquito spray." and lange, before going on the same boat to reach the island, says to bridges about grodin: "Do you think he's the one? My horoscope says I'm in crossover waters and will meet the biggest person in my life". those kind of lines are catered right at the audience, and it is done well - not seeming forced. the second part of the film (the film has three like the original), after kong gets his gal and takes her on the island "honeymoon", is just okay. there's some great action scenes herein, but it lacks very much what the original had with the dinosaurs and all that great stuff. there's a snake in one scene that looks like it was made from paper machee for a third grade project. the face of the snake resembles michael keaton's face in BEETLEJUICE when he turned into a serpent, but the effects are... well... kind of lame compared to the original - back in a time when special effects were just beginning. the third part of the movie is the worst. the picture pretty much falls apart in new york. it is very sad to see the World Trade Center, but it was somewhat clever, at that time, using these two buildings to remind kong of two thin mountains back on the island. but the whole part lacks something. lange and bridges having a drink in a dusty tavern while kong is out killing new yorkers is kind of lame. and the end scene when kong reaches the top of the buildings is a big letdown, being that it was the best part of the original, that is, the plane vs. kong battle, which is reduced to a seven minute fight scene of kong vs. a couple GI JOE toy helicopters. all in all, this movie isnt that bad. it is nostalgic in its own way. the special effects remind me of SUPERMAN, being that that movie had the same producer. the effects arent perfect but they stand up pretty good today. because I'm not the only one who thinks that the almighty CGI is anything but allmighty. sure it looks great at times, but let's face it, no matter how good it looks, it just ain't ACTUAL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated failure of a remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The popular label stamped on this film is that it is a failure. While this I agree, there are certain good points that are done better than the original.In the original classic, Ann Darrow, the damsel in distress, had no good feelings whatsoever for the unfortunate giant ape. Her function in the story was to be carried about by Kong, and, of course, scream. This remake, however, is more developed as a drama. Kong is treated more as a character, rather than a destroying machine that happens to have a certain bewildering attraction to blonds. Ann is also portrayed more as a character than a screaming doll, and she develops a liking for Kong that allows this film to become quite touching. And the eccentric who captures and brings Kong to the civilized world is appropriately portrayed as the scoundrel he should be.But the problem is, King Kong is not just any old love story. What is lacking in the remake is action. While the original Kong spent half the movie beating up an impressive collection of fanged agents of death, this film contains only one other monster, which, after a very brief and very boring struggle, never shows its rubber muppet-like self again. The quality of the effects is also very bad. Although the film is in colour, the effects are, in all practicality, inferior to that of the original, which was already over forty years old at the time. Another potential problem is that this film, on top of the lack of action, ended up a little too serious than need be. One element is that, what was a film-making expedition in the original was turned into a corporate-run oil expedition. While this is no problem in itself, it strays a little too far from the fact that King Kong is not expected to be anything more than entertainment. Personally, I feel that this message of how dangerous corporate society can be is a very good and important one, but in this movie it lacks the ominous subtlety I believe best fit for it (as in the earlier "Alien" movies, for example), and, as if aware of the fact that fans don't want a story too dark, this angle seems to be only half-heartedly pursued. The effect is that it comes out a little deliberate and cheesy.All in all, the good thing about this movie is that it puts emphasis on the drama. The bad thing is that that is all it pays attention to. It was a very good try, but to sum up the mistakes of this movie, while the drama of King Kong is what mostly makes it distinguishable from other monster flicks, this story is simply not allowed to be just a drama. The lord of all monster movies is, after all, a monster movie, and the makers appear to have forgotten that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahhh the 70's!! Most people disdain the 70's but I grew up in the decade and the movies have fond memories for me. One film I remember was the 1976 remake, King Kong.When news came out about the film, it was heavily touted and publicized. Of course everyone has seen the classic Fay Wray original, can a remake be better? well....yes...and no...This film marked the debut of Jessica Lange and launched her on an acting career. Previously she was a model and heard a casting call for a part for a blond actress for the part of Kong's hapless mate. It was said that they were seriously considering Barbara Striesand (oy vey) for the role. But rumor had it that Babs was VERY demanding so they decided to go with an unknown for the part.Some imaginative special effects are used but by comparison with today's technology, they are considered to be pretty lame. There are major plot changes since the film is set in modern times. First, the gas shortages or "Energy Crisis" was alive and well during this time. So it is not surprising that an oil company is made the primary villain in the 70's Kong. Also the environmental movement was starting out and the character of Jack was influenced by it.Much was published that the "New" World Trade Center was picked as the building which Kong would make his famous climb on. Looking at it now and seeing films from the past 911 tragedy still gives me a little chill and a sorrow for past days.However, all and all, despite the God forsaken cheesy script, the mechanical gorilla arms etc... I would recommend King Kong 1976 as a popcorn guilty pleasure or cult film. Just see it--like all monster films it is pure fantasy magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually like remakes, but for this one, I'll make an exception. As you know... the 1933 original version was really something special, something amazing, and how do you expect for remake to beat it. It can't, it's impossible. But this film, it has something solid in it. After 43 years later, this film has some particular details from the original version (original was powerful even back then). The idea about "beauty and beast" is more distinctive than before (because in the original, the leading lady was scared and only did screaming) and it was set in the 70s for some necessary reason and I think that worked well.John Guillermin did a solid job on this film, but I think that the edge lies within adorable Jessica Lange (who plays the bride of Kong), she was for reason chosen for the role, because her beauty and acting talent were immense for this version. Now, other actors... Jeff Bridges (who plays an primate paleontologist Jack), he did a good job, but some reason... I could not stop laughing, every time I see him, because he reminds me of a Dude Lebowski :D. So that's what Dude did before some leaked at his rug... Charles Grodin as a wealthy oil company business, he was good at his terrain John Randolph and Rene Auberjonois were also good, and to mention bit parts like Julius Harris (the deep voiced, menacing dude, who played Bond villain Tee Hee), Jack O'Halloran (the superman enemy Non) and always supporting actor Ed Lauter, who was good.Now, for the Kong... this time it was a guy in the suit, who walked over a large forest models and for some scenes, they used a large hands and feet, which was a good usage for that time, (they also did that in original, but here felt much more better) and they also edited Kong's face on a large screen for most close-up scenes between lady and the ape. The ending brought as again in New York, where they planned to use Kong as a oil company mascot, but he didn't liked... and guess what... OK, I am not gonna spoil anything here, but you know what happens on the end. Overall, nice filming location, nice visuals, nice cinematography and nice score from John Barry. Enjoy this film. And, honestly... I like this remake more than 2005 remake...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chills!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This seemingly dark adaption to Merian C Cooper's and Egdar Wallace's has proved itself to be - an enjoyable and uncanningly talented piece of work. Dino De Laurentiis' team up with John Gullermin to remake a seminal horror/action classic has turned it into a new dimension unexplored and well deserved. Be warned, this version holds you firmly in it's palm, and doesn't let go.The performances are what make the film a bit more bearable once you realize that the characters that intend to sail to Kong's domain of ancient evil aren't going there to capture him on film or, capture anything at all. Instead, we're faced with filthy money-grubbing men who care nothing for anything else except the one thing that will score them big money - oil. Although, watching a handful of people trying to make a film with 1930's equipment can get a little irritating and somewhat boring. So, setting it in the modern, like the 1933 original did in it's time, seemed like the right thing to do. Jessica Lange's character, Dwan, does take time getting used to, but her affection for Jeff Bridges' character, Jack Prescott, is the only thing that makes her worth watching.Speaking of which, how does this ditsy Dwan end up sailing across the high-seas with oil harvesters? Well, there's a little twist that ends up making the chemistry between Jack - who turns out to be a stowaway - even more exciting. More to the point of chemistry, Gullermin focuses more on the chemistry between Kong and Dwan. A little too much, perhaps, but through this we see the most fantastic performance out of Jessica Lange. The films climax can be seen as a little ridiculous to the other eye, but is still tear worthy. The bond between Kong and Dwan is more touching than Kong's farewell. Lange proves herself worthy during the films climax, once we hear he scream, 'Don't kill him!! Don't KILL HIM!!' The special effects are quite amazing - Kong has been constructed and performed brilliantly, by the wonderful Rick Baker. The sets are quite a spectacle themselves. The miniatures are probably the most convincing ones that cinema has ever seen. The island sets (whether they truly are sets, they still attract the eye) express more characterized, moody and dark elements than you would normally find in real cultures. Oh, and John Barry's score is simply and utterly, amazing. It gives me chills every single time it's cue is due. Probably the best tracks of the film are 'Full Domain - Beauty is a Beast', and 'Arrival on the Island', 'Sacrifice - Hail to the King' - but all tracks are great and are definitely a real triumph.The atmosphere is probably the thing I love most about this movie. I always love watching it, and looking at the hills in the background, and wondering.. 'What lurks over there?' The thing about this, is that if it was made anywhere else, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did. The island itself is quite a hellish place, in the fact that it's almost like a desert, with shallow jungle. So, you end up wondering, 'How does a forty-five foot two legged gorilla end up living here?' It's a great mystery, that will only lead you watching the film countless times just to find clues. There also isn't much wildlife on Skull Island - just Kong, and a giant snake that he faces in defending his love, Dwan... You then end up wondering, 'Where the heck did the snake came from? Are there more?' People call these plot holes, but I call this the perfect atmosphere that cinema has given in quite some time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of the 1933 king Kong. Set as an expedition of the oil company to a land untouched. Prescott sneaks into the expedition and warns the people about the "giant roar".Yet the expedition continues. The story introduces us to the giant ape and how he falls for Dwan. Oil seekers find out about King Kong and think that capturing the great ape would be an excellent gimmick for the promotion of their company. Jessica Lange played the famous role of Dwan. The movie take us through the journey ... how a beast develops a soft heart and ends up in NY city.The movie is an epic and I still find it as fascinating and captivating as I found it the day I had first watched it. The idea was brilliant.The movie is quoted to have a $23 million budget.It made a huge gross revenue and is one of the classics produced by the paramount pictures.</fullReview>

I kept waiting for it to turn bad and it does slightly in the last 15 minutes but up to then it had been a highly entertaining engrossing action movie. Jessica Lange in her debut performance was pretty good only faltering a little at the end. I thought the monkey effects were a lot more impressive (and expressive) than I was expecting and totally acceptable for a 1976 made film. Maybe we've been a little spoilt seeing so many computer generated effects films in the last 20 years. Having John Barry compose the score is always a good way to make a film seem special and here he delivers another memorable score that certainly adds to the pleasure of watching the film.

		<fullReview>I liked this movie, I cant believe "King Kong (1976)" has such as low grade, I think this film must have at least 6.5 stars.What I liked the most is that they changed the beginning of the plot from the original making that a crew looking for oil found Kong by chance in the island. I liked more the Kong of this film than of the 2005 version because I found it more real than the Kong created by computer. Another point in favor of this movie is that it lasts just 134 minutes instead of the 187 minutes of the 2005 which I found very long and sometimes boring. I know that this version sometimes looks so naive but I think that this is one of its strength too because this movie just looks being entertaining nothing else. Ah and the most important thing is that we can watch the beautiful legs of the hot Jessica Lange (she looks great in those shorts jeans, thanks god ;)).The plot is about a group of men who go to an island looking for oil with Jack Prescott (an adventurous anthropologist who is looking for a very big beast) and Dwan (a beautiful and silly starlet) who weren't part of this crew at the beginning. When they get to the island they find natives who have as their god a enormous gorilla called Kong and ......I recommend it to everyone who wants to relax watching a light and entertaining adventure movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director John Guillerman's updated version of the classic monster story sees petroleum giant Petrox mounting an expedition to the legendary Skull Island in the hope of discovering new oil deposits. Seizing a chance for a free trip to the supposed home of a mythical giant ape, paleontologist Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) stows away on board, and the expedition is also joined midway by beautiful castaway Dwan (Jessica Lange), who is found drifting in a life-raft after a violent storm sinks the yacht she was travelling on.On arriving at the island, the explorers do indeed discover oil, but also find that the island is inhabited by a savage tribe who worship an ape god named Kong, and they want Dwan to be his bride, whether she agrees to the ceremony or not...Jaws might have been the first ever summer blockbuster, but it was this 1976 remake of King Kong that turned a mere movie into an 'event': I can clearly recall the hype, the build-up, and the excitement that preceded its release, and on seeing the film, I remember being absolutely enthralled. Admittedly, I was only 8 at the time, and any trip to the cinema was an experience, but this was Kong, and as far as I was concerned, he ruled!Unfortunately, critics weren't quite as happy with Guilllerman's version of the great ape adventure as I was: the movie was panned, and was even considered a flop despite making bags of cash. On re-watching the film, I now recognise the flaws in the script, the inadequacies of the effects, and the silliness of the dialogue, but overall, I gotta say that I still find this film a lot of fun?not as much as the '33 original (of course), but certainly more than Peter Jackson's recent bloated, three hour long exercise in excess.Guillerman's direction is solid without being too showy, his cast are likable enough (although Lange's ditzy Marilyn Monroe style performance does irritate at times), the plot modifications are bearable given the contemporary setting, and the beautiful cinematography, by Richard H. Kline, not only delivers some breathtaking shots of the stunning locales, but also makes the most of Rick Baker and Carlo Rambaldi's ape effects. From a distance, Kong does look rather iffy?clearly a man in a monkey suit?but the close ups are incredible, with the creature displaying a remarkable range of expressions and emotions; the scene where Kong dries his woman after a waterfall shower is particularly impressive, with the cheeks puffing up and the lips blowing air over an appreciative Lange.As far as excitement is concerned, don't expect too much from the island based action?the famous tree scene is kinda disappointing, and Kong only gets to wrestle one rather rubbery snake?but once our massive primate gets to New York, the really good stuff kicks in: after Kong has broken free from his cage, he gets to play havoc with the subway, goes for a swim in the Hudson, scales the World Trade Centre, is attacked by flamethrowers, leaps from one tower to another, and trashes a couple of helicopters. Then he shot to pieces and falls to the ground.As time has passed, people have gradually come to accept that this attempt at re-filming King Kong isn't as terrible as it was originally painted to be. And if you've seen the other two versions, you might as well see this one as well; you never know, you might enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second Time Unlucky?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the list of terrible crimes people have committed throughout history, in some people's eyes Dino De Laurentis' decision to remake King Kong ranks slightly higher than the Holocaust, 9/11 and slavery. Basically, this movie apparently has no redeeming features whatsoever. De Laurentis' decision to build a 40 foot robot Kong that was virtually unusable; the fact that Kong was mainly played by a man in a suit; the contemporary setting; the absence of dinosaur battles; the climax on top of the World Trade Centre; Jessica Lange's character's stupid name (what in the blue buggery is a Dwan, anyway?); if Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, Jack the Ripper, Hitler and Satan formed a gang and started burning down orphanages, they wouldn't receive the same level of criticism.Personally, I have something of a soft spot for this movie, and consider it to be extremely underrated. Much like the 1998 U.S Godzilla, it's not as good as the original, but it's still a decent film. I suppose the reason I like it is because, like Godzilla, I saw the remake before the original, and as such I didn't have any preconceptions about what I should see; I wasn't expecting fights with dinosaurs, and so I wasn't disappointed when I didn't see them.I suppose what people dislike about this film is that, unlike Peter Jackson's 2005 version, which is a faithful retelling of the 1933 King Kong, Kong 76 bears little resemblance to the original. It's set in 1976 and has a whole new set of characters who, it has to be said, aren't great. Charles Grodin's Fred Wilson is annoying and it's a relief to see him get splattered by Kong at the end. Jeff Bridges does better as Jack Prescott, but he's still fairly forgettable, and Jessica Lange just doesn't engage the viewer like Fay Wray. Fortunately, these three actors emerged unscathed and went on to have successful careers, unlike director John Guillermin, who ended up having to make the unnecessary sequel, King Kong Lives, which was seen by about three people. The contemporary setting just doesn't lend itself to the fantastical story, and having a petrochemical company at the heart of proceedings feels like the producers were trying to hard to be modern. Also, having Kong in a cage wearing a crown with the company logo on it just looks moronic.The most vociferous criticism has been directed at the film's special effects which, given that they were done by Carlo Rambaldi and Rick Baker, ought to have been something really special, or at least better than those of a movie that even back in 1976 was over forty years old. To be fair, Rick Baker's Kong suit is a lot better than most gorilla suits seen in movies (see King Kong Escapes, APE and The Mighty Gorga for example of how bad these things can be) and at least he tried to make it look like a real gorilla, wearing contact lenses that looked like a gorilla's eyes and basing the muscle structure on real apes. The real problem is Rambaldi's 40 foot robot Kong; while this creation had tremendous publicity value (no one could ever accuse Dino De Laurentis of being understated) when it came time to actually use the thing, it was obvious that having a 40 foot tall robot that needed to be operated by an army of technicians rampaging around New York and climbing the World Trade Centre was ever so slightly unfeasible, and so the robot only appears in a couple of scenes, mainly where Kong is standing still. The only time the thing moves is when it lifts one arm and then it just looks like a big, unconvincing robot.In spite of these criticisms, King Kong 1976 does have some good points, notably his NYC rampage and the finale still makes you feel sorry for the big ape, particularly the close-ups of machine gun fire hitting him. The scene where Dwan punches Kong on the nose is amusing and may have inspired Naomi Watts' feistier heroine in the 2005 version, and, in a strange way, making Kong look so stupid in that crown and cage actually increases viewer sympathy for him. Basically, this movie is not the Antichrist of cinema, and if you're in the mood for some big gorilla action, it's definitely worthy of your time, provided you don't expect a shot-for-shot reworking of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remastered version is needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a film that hasn't aged well. It is actually aged quite badly: the difference between Kong and the trick shoots are so painfully obvious that it's pretty distracting, as you see this blueish tint in every trick scene. It's not even charming as it's in the original '33 version of the film.I just saw this film recently from the TV, and it was quite obvious that at least that version wasn't remastered and cleaned, as the picture quality resembled bad VHS tape copy. Actually, the film itself wouldn't be that bad, it's actually just average, as some people make it out to be, but it would take some image cleaning and remastering.One thing is pretty clear from the start: Kong is a man in an ape suit. That wouldn't actually matter much, if the actor would even try to move like a gigantic ape, but he doesn't. instead he walks like a man in an ape suit and that pretty much succeeds in breaking up the illusion of a great ape.The plot line is almost the same as in the original: white man go island, white girl gets caught by an ape, white man catches the ape. This time it's just an oil company looking for oil instead of filmmakers. The company want's Kong in their commercials. Jessica Lange play Dawn, the Kong's new love object and Jeff Bridges is Jack, the good guy trying to save her and in the end the ape. Acting is okay as such, a bit pompous and unintentionally funny in some places. It's just, that when you take out the dinosaurs the film isn't as exiting as the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I have great respect, and admiration for the 1933 Cooper, Shoedsdack film, I've got to say...this remake wasn't all that bad. As a matter of fact, I'm still bowled over with vertigo during the chasm scene. The movie ran into problems in the final reel where the greed, and vaingloriousness of the Charles Grodin character was a bit overemphasized (hyperbola, actually--then again, for someone in the oil business, his insanity may have been right on the mark).Jessica Lange's sympathetic approach to the great ape was well meaning.In 1976, this movie was very popular with audiences, if not critics who, if I recall, proceeded to bash it immediately, though the box office returns told another story completely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Twin Towers" Nostalgia Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 21-years-old when this film hit theaters and, frankly, I disliked it then for a couple of reasons:1) I saw the original version on TV as a child and resented any attempt to remake one of my favorite movies. (My attitude toward remakes has since changed.)2) The Twin Towers of the World Trade Center (not the Empire State Building) were featured in the climax of the 1976 version. In addition to resenting remakes, I was still upset that the Twin Towers had snatched the title of "World's Tallest Skyscraper" from the Empire State Building (and then lost the title within a couple of years to the even-taller Sears Tower in Chicago.)As far as I can tell, King Kong (1976) was the first of many films that prominently featured the late-Twin Towers. Like many New Yorkers, my initial attitude toward the Towers evolved from disdain - to grudging acceptance - to affection. They were an incredible sight to behold, and the view from the South Tower observation deck was unforgettable.King Kong (1976) offered state-of-the art sfx and lots of action. Anyone who expects Academy Award-worthy performances from a Sci-Fi/Adventure flick is missing the point. All movies are time-capsules that preserve the attitudes, trends, language, etc., of the decade in which they were made. King Kong (1976) blends imaginative adventure with the Ecology/Environmental Movement of the Seventies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this ''King Kong'' yesterday, since I loved the King Kong version of 2005. It's not a horrible movie, but I can say it is far from what I expected to be. First, I saw many errors and horrible effects that I couldn't believe that were used for such a famous movie! Even the wires can be seen holding the big mechanic Kong in one of the scenes! There are no dinosaurs on Kong's island,only a horrible rubber snake. I don't like Dwan as I liked Ann Darrow. The Kong of this movie is so artificial, and some scenes, like when he sees Dwan by the window were clear to me that it was a mechanical ape. Jackson's Kong respected the original has the same characters , the key events were the same, Kong looks much more realistic as an ape, and the relationship between Kong and Ann is much more interesting then the others.But there are some good things: I liked the ending of this movie,because is not a cliché. The character Jack is much more interesting in this version then the one from Peter Jackson's, that is a looser.Interesting page about King Kong, specially the one from this movie!;) http://www.pulpanddagger.com/canuck/kongpage6.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very bad, but fortunately "good" bad most of the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the perfect example how you can take the story of an excellent film, in fact one of the greatest motion pictures ever made, remake it 42 years later, and come up with garbage that is only watchable because it is often quite funny to view."King Kong" from 1976 is a very bad film, make no doubt about it. The only actor who is even halfway decent is Bridges, and because he is good he seems quite out of place in the movie, like he is taking his role in a "comedy" way too seriously, therefore making for odd viewing. And Jessica Lange, she is so embarrassingly bad, it is quite hard to imagine she actually went on to earn much praise as an actress. Obviously in 1976 she couldn't act at all, maybe she got the role because she looked decent in those cute little shorts she wears on Skull Island.I actually saw this film in the movies, and I remember the long line around the theater to see it. Bad word of mouth eventually got around, but everyone, including myself, was facinated by the hype, especially with the "robot" Kong. As such a young kid I wanted to believe the robot was used throughout the film, instead of just a few seconds when Kong escapes from the arena. And when the shots make the switch to the robot Kong, where he is totally still except for his arm moving a little bit or his hand releasing some metal, it is so funny you cannot help but say, "were they kidding?"I'm willing to bet that Dino knew darn well the robot was going to look like crap on screen. But it certainly got the film a lot of press and put people in the seats. The huge arms and hands though, that operated on their own and not on the actual robot, were great and very realistic.The strange thing though, is that with all the computer effects crap in films nowadays, when the new remake comes out in 2005 with a "computer generated" Kong, that won't look as good as the robot, because computer effects suck. They look like cartoons and videogames, they do NOT look real at all. That's why that silly stationary robot in 1976's "Kong" will look better, because it was "real" and an actual object. If you thought the "effects" in movies like the new Star Wars films, the Rings films, "Spiderman" and "The Hulk" looked real at all, then you are very easily pleased.But "Kong" from 1976 is fun viewing as bad as it is, and it should get a proper DVD release with extras including all the deleted scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dino DeLaurentiis' remake of "King Kong" was about as good as could be expected. This movie, a re-imagining of the original story from 1933, puts sort of an environmental spin on it. This version tries to be more sympathetic to the giant gorilla. Jessica Lange as Dwan tries to see beneath the monstrous exterior to find a soul. meanwhile, Charles Grodin as Petrox oil shark Fred Wilson just wants to exploit Kong. This all leads to the climax at the World Trade Center. Nothing against the Twin Towers, but many of us prefer to see King Kong climbing the Empire State Building. That remains an indelible pop culture image. Anyway, here's hoping that Peter Jackson's upcoming take on "King Kong" can do the justice that Dino DeLaurentiis could not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Spielberg leaving milk out for two days in the Sahara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always fun to start a review by getting everyone p'ed off so they can get right to their "not helpful" vote and quickly move on, so here it is--if you are a big Steven Spielberg fan, there's a good chance you'll find this John Guillermin-directed version of King Kong entertaining, because all of the flaws typical of Spielberg are present here. In fact, as this Kong progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to believe that this wasn't really directed by Spielberg. You see, I'm not the biggest Spielberg fan. I don't exactly hate his work--heck, he's even produced a decent number of 10s in my book, but more often than not, I find Spielberg annoying. He has good, interesting core ideas--and I'm thinking here of the obvious stylistic hand he has in his film's premises and stories--but he usually ruins them with ham-handed direction. It's common during a Spielberg film that the longer it goes on, the more I can't wait for it to end. That's exactly how I felt with King Kong.Actually, I was prepared to give this version about a 6 for maybe the first hour or so. As others have noted, the story follows the far superior 1933 King Kong very closely, with some changes to make it more socially relevant and ironic for the mid 1970s. Those aren't bad, and in some cases, they're very good. The mystery of Skull Island, King Kong's native land, is maybe handled even better here than in the original. The "paranormal" fog was a great idea (the "normal" explanations for it a bit more loopy). The Hawaiian location certainly looked impressive. The mystery of the soon-to-be-screaming hot babe--in this case portrayed by Jessica Lange, in her debut as the ridiculously named "Dwan"--was an improvement over the original, too, as in the original, it seemed like maybe not much thought was put into the premise behind getting Fay Wray's character on the ship (even though Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack did marvelous things with the premise later, unlike Guillermin's feat of losing all his potential here).But the problems begin taking over by the time Kong appears. Kong looks very fake. It's obvious that it's a guy in a monkey suit, aided by an animatronic mask and a giant robot arm and hand. Of course, Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation in the original is obviously fake, too, but there, Harryhausen's work has a fantastical charm, and more importantly, it never breaks the flow of the film. In this version, it's difficult to watch without thinking about how each Kong shot was done. The film has a very uneven look. Studio shots poorly match the atmosphere of location shots. Rear projection techniques are blatant. Sometimes the foreground action isn't positioned very well relative to the rear projection. The big mechanical hand just looks like a big mechanical hand, and Guillermin milks it until big stinky chunks pour out instead.Still, that might not have to kill the film. If you know me, you know I don't require realism at all. And I can use my imagination to fill in the blanks and rough edges. But at the same time that the look of the film is going to hell and the seams are beginning to show, two other problems begin appearing. One, what seemed like a slightly cheesy and clunky but still somewhat charming script goes from a semi-polished draft to pages that must have been transcribed straight from barroom napkins to the shooting script. Increasingly, dramatic developments make no sense and the dialogue keeps getting more ridiculous. That never ends. It just keeps getting more problematic until the end of the film. In conjunction with this, the performances begin to go off the rails. Guillermin suddenly has everyone begin overacting. That never ends either.Just like the seams begin to show on effects shots, the seams begin falling apart more generally on a directorial level. Scenes that have little logical connection to the story are obviously inserted just for "dramatic impact"--things like odd reaction shots, odd behavior, and so on. Guillermin has everyone overact for these, of course, and he seems to have printed rough takes. Adding insult to injury, these are then edited so that they begin too soon and end too late. For scenes that should have had dramatic impact, such as Fred Wilson's (Charles Grodin) final encounter with Kong, we again get stinky chunks of milk, with too many badly edited/timed reaction shots of Grodin, so that most of the audience will be wondering why he wouldn't just get up and run away, given the 3 or 4 minutes that he seems to have.Far too much of the film is written in one of the more well-defined senses of "contrived"--people end up where they do just so the script can continue. There's little reason to their behavior beyond that. For example, Dwan ends up endangering herself just because that scene needs to be there to create a little tension. Kong finds people in New York City as if they had a huge flashing neon sign advertising their location, just because Kong needs to find them so they can all get to the next scene. Again, these missteps never end until the film does.Other than those odd folks who think that Spielberg is a consistent genius, it's difficult for me to actually recommend this King Kong to anyone except maybe for huge fans of these actors. Lange is certainly attractive in the film in her various outfits designed to be revealing in very specific ways, but even that is robbed of some of its libidinal value by the "obvious contrivance" factor. Whether you're a big fan of King Kong films or just casually interested, this version is the last place to head for a Kong fix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy, but not a total disaster...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This ambitious remake of the 1933 classic is neither as bad nor as good as you may have heard from many different sources. It's just kind of "average". In its first hour, about the only thing that keeps it going is Jessica Lange's gorgeousness (she has a superbly well-defined figure, which is very often exposed). Then, the pace picks up and the special effects take over, but they are variable in quality; sometimes Kong looks awesome, just like he should, but other scenes don't work at all (the low points are his fight with a rubber snake and a scene at the end where Lange supposedly "touches" his bleeding body). What I disliked most of all here were the moments of campiness (Kong grinning leeringly to Lange, Lange calling him a "big chauvinist ape"). But it's fairly entertaining, and the last 20 minutes are now historically important, too - for obvious reasons. (**)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst King Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I adore the 1933 film and liked the 2005 remake, but while I don't hate this I dislike it. The cinematography, sets and most of the costumes are good, the music is decent, Jeff Bridges does what he can in his role and succeeds and I loved King Kong's ape face(if not his costume) as it did look great. However, the film is overlong and filled with pointless exposition that goes absolutely nowhere, while on the whole the entire Skull Island sequence is uneventful and devoid of tension, mystery and atmosphere. The script may be grittier and more cynical, but some of the dialogue is also so bad it makes you cringe, Charles Grodin and Jessica Lange get the worst of it. The story is poorly paced and dull, while I felt nothing for the characters and didn't believe at all in the contrived romance. Apart from Bridges the acting is very bland, Charles Grodin is more annoying than funny, Jessica Lange is very sexy but her performance is marred by insipid dialogue and a poorly written character and King Kong is little more than a man in a cheap giant ape suit and there were times when I found him creepy(in a bad way) rather than lovable and poignant. In conclusion, for me despite Bridges and other decent aspects this is the worst King Kong movie. 4/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, But Watchable Debut of Jessica Lange</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The owner of the oil company Petrox Corporation, Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin), invests all his possessions searching oil in an unexplored island. The vessel leaves Surubaya, in Indonesia, with the stowaway Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges), who wants to protect an ape called Kong. While traveling, they find the castaway Dwan (Jessica Lange) in the middle of nowhere in a rescue boat in the ocean and bring her on board. The group finds that the island is inhabited and the local natives worship a huge gorilla called Kong. They abduct Dwan to offer her in a sacrifice to Kong. The crew hikes into the jungle trying to rescue Ann. King Kong falls in love for Ann and protects her against a huge serpent. When Fred finds that the oil in the island is not ready for exploitation, he decides to capture Kong and bring to New York for exhibition. In the middle of a show, King Kong escapes, goes to the World Trade Center bringing panic to the locals.In the last days, I saw Peter Jackson's remake of "King Kong" and the 1933 masterpiece. I have just seen this 1976 version again for comparison. The 1976 version of King Kong is flawed, with very poor special effects and many mistakes. For example, the arrangement of a tanker, with accommodation quarters, galleys and machinery spaces adjacent to the bulkhead of a cargo tank is totally impossible. Then Dwan is trying to escape from Kong in the wood, the chains clink, but later the sound stops. But the screenplay at least adapts the story to the present days (in 1976), and it is not a pure and simply copy of the original screenplay, like Peter Jackson's remake. Jessica Lange is extremely hot and explored in her debut in the silly character of Dwan, who stays partially naked most of the time, inclusive in a vessel crowded of men. Jack Prescott, the character of Jeff Bridges, looks like a lunatic. This movie gives also an opportunity to see the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Nevertheless, this version is watchable and entertains. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "King Kong"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man in rubber suit alert!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, sadly its true. Not only true, but shockingly, totally and completely devoid of even the slightest hint of "is it or isn't it?" This movie was going OK right up until "Kong" appeared. Even for 1976, the effects here are pretty diabolical.Basically Kong is some guy in a monkey suit who, in their infinite wisdom, the film-makers of this atrocity believe will convince you he's a 50 foot ape. They even pulled their ace card out to help maintain and enhance the illusion......filming the guy in the suit from a low angle, so he appears bigger. Gasp! Oh the high-techness of it all!One wonders, in the original '33 version, whether the crew weighed up the pros and cons of trying to get away with a guy in a suit. I can almost see them doing a few test shots and reviewing the footage. They turn to one another, the mouth of one quivers, then they all fall about laughing. "Man, this is too retarded! We'll never get away with that! Go with that new-fangled stop-motion stuff." So quite why the '76 crew thought they could make it real is beyond comprehension.Further, the guy playing Kong, coupled with the dark makeup, had a rather unfortunate tendency to leer and letch maniacally throughout the film. The only recent actor I've seen do anything like this is Robert O'Reilly, who played (overacted gloriously) Chancellor Gowron from the ST:TNG and DS9 series. But in Kong's case, the effect is disturbing rather than humourous and you are left feeling rather unsettled.If it was only Kong, it might have been bearable, but all manner of ridiculous things crop up here that make you wonder if you're watching some student project. The trees wobble as "Kong" pushes through them in the most rubbery way and look about as convincing as the model trees I used to have for me train set as a kid. Then there are the sets. I'm sorry, but a poorly dressed sound stage will never convince me it's a tropical island, no matter how garish it looks. In order to add realism Dino and clan added some truly atrocious back-projected scenes, including "The Mother of all Bad Back-Projection Scenes (tm)" involving Kong atop the World Trade Centres with circling helicopters in the background. In some shots, the helicopters wobble and even fly backwards as they pass by in the background. Now that's flying!But my award for "All-Time Lame-Ass Creature Effects" goes to the stupefyingly un-lifelike snake that Kong fights (read as "wraps himself up in unconvincingly"). I will never bad-mouth the snake in Anaconda again! It's perfection compared to this. What's worse, this snake is one of that rare breed of ophidians which is both a constrictor and a poisonous variety - an Anacobra. The snake is soooo bad. Trust me. I've seen draught excluders that look more lifelike.With the above emerging in all too terrifyingly real comic proportions, I quickly found the whole film an entertaining joy to watch. It's one of those "They don't seriously expect us to buy this? Do they?" movies that you have to keep watching just to see how awful it will get. And trust me, it gets pretty darn bad. Jeff Bridge's beard is shockingly unkempt in an uncaring Robinson Crusoe kind of way and Jessica Lange's character is so vapid that I kept hoping that someone....anyone...would slap her about a bit to get some kind of response other than the stat "I'm cute, look at me" routine she was locked into.If you're a fan of the original, watching this will be like having your teeth pulled. If you fancy a beer-and-giggles evening then this movie has to be high on the list, if not No. 1 for bad movie-ness.Yet again a wonderful Dino de Horrendous production. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dino de Laurentiis' terrible remake of the 1933 classic that stands as a pretty big turd stain on his reputation. The plot to the original film is mostly the same here, with some minor (unnecessary) changes. This one starts out with an expedition led by Charles Grodin to find oil on an island that remains perpetually shrouded in fog. Along the way stowaway paleontologist Jeff Bridges and rescued castaway Jessica Lange join the expedition. Soon they're on the island and, well, you probably know what happens next.The script is courtesy of Lorenzo Semple, a writer of some respectability who dabbled in camp (he wrote for the '60s Batman TV series and also wrote the screenplays for Flash Gordon, Sheena, and the Raquel Welch "classic" Fathom). So throughout the film there's a not-so-subtle amount of nose-thumbing going on that's kind of insulting to fans of the original movie. To add more insult, the special effects for Kong basically consist of Rick Baker in an ape suit and an overpriced mechanical ape seen briefly here and there. Of the cast, Jeff Bridges comes out best. Which is to say he's the only one who goes through the motions without embarrassing himself. Charles Grodin chews scenery as he almost always does. The worst acting by far comes from Jessica Lange in her film debut. Her ditzy actress character "Dwan" is pretty bad on paper but Lange's breathlessly vapid performance just makes it all that much worse. Every scene with her is cringeworthy. The biggest thing that kills the movie is the sheer lack of wonder and imagination. You shouldn't do a movie about King Kong sarcastically or tongue-in-cheek or any of that stuff. It's a fantastic concept and you have to lose yourself in it or it just won't work like it should. 1933 as well as 2005 got it right, but 1976 shat the bed.</fullReview>

Charles Grodin plays a Petrox oil company representative named Fred Wilson sent to Skull Island to find rumored oil reserves there, which would greatly enrich himself and the company. Opposing this is Jack Prescott(played by Jeff Bridges) an environmentalist determined to investigate what Petrox is up to. They discover a shipwreck survivor named Dwan(played by Jessica Lange) who comes ashore on the island, where she and the crew face similar menaces that Fay Wray and that crew did in the original. Kong is later captured and brought for public display by Petrox, but resents this captivity, escaping his restraints and going on a rampage before heading for the World Trade Center...Marginal film has some exciting scenes, good ape costume and thoughtful ideas, but is hurt by some poor dialogue, unintentional humor, and lack of ambition in the jungle sequence(just a giant snake!) Still, a strange feeling seeing Kong atop the World Trade Center after 9/11...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time and Reflection, while this movie wasn't the mega blockbuster hit they had hoped when it came out in 1977 it by no means was a total flop. The Critics slaughtered Jessica Lange's performance, recently I watched this movie again online and found her performance genuine to the times, and even a more sophisticated, optimistic characterization that embodied an aspiring actress looking for fame. By contrast to the performance Naomi Watts gives in the total remake of the original Kong (lets note this Kong was not a total remake but an update of the original to the 1970's), Watt's plays a down trodden yet confident actress looking for a big break, while Lange plays a modern woman who wants is starved for fame and uses her sex appeal and smarts with a sense of wonder and innocence mixed in its a little Marilyn Monroe at times, watching her now it all seems appropriate. The movie itself has many great moments the writer was really trying to accomplish something did her fully realize it not always some of it may have ended up on the cutting room floor or was re-written on the fly as is often the case with any film. I do believe this to be a modern filmmaking achievement and can be considered a modern day classic despite some of its dated special FX it was State of the Art at the time of its release including the use of the World Trade Center instead of the Empire State Building. If you've never seen this movie or its been a long time since you last saw it I recommend a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true Kong re-imagining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know having re-watched the 1976 version a few days ago, my opinion on the film has drastically changed. I actually appreciate it for having the guts and determination to re-image this great tale by taking it in a completely different direction without disrespecting or ignoring the source material it stays faithful to. It doesn't rehash the original film nor does it update on its context, it borrows the basic concept of obviously a giant overgrown Ape on a strange island when its symbolized as a god only this time an expedition of the "Petrox" company is exploring in search of petrol when the girl is captured by the Ape and is fantasized about here. One of the general complaints about this film is that there are no dinosaurs located on the island, but it seemed to me that the film was trying to lead into a more realistic and believable approach rather then a straight up fun fantasy about shooting and violence. That's not to say that I dislike the 1933 or 2005 versions, in fact I still greatly prefer them to the '76 version, but I can understand the intentions in terms of the new ideas and concepts they were trying to inflict on the story this time around. The relationship between Kong and the girl was kept at a happy medium without being too scared and feeling nothing like in 1933, or being too friendly and not at all scared like in '05, so I thought the balance worked well apart from a few corny scenes in between. So all in all, I'd bump the rating up from a 4/10 to a 7/10 making it my third favorite Kong film behind the original and '05 remake. It's amazing what a re-watch can do with an open mind on the prospective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top message, but lots to like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of King Kong has a log scene, so it has all it needs.The story, by the way, is bunch of white guys land on uncivilized, uncharted island full of monsters, and capture a big ape, who makes the girl with them his little pet.This version indicates a sort of love affair, which is pretty ridiculous considering it would be like a normal sized man having a love affair with a three inch high woman. It really only works as a "loved pet" scenario.That said, this version established some believable characters, and gave the minor characters more depth than the original. In most ways, it is a much better story than the original.The Robert Armstrong character has since been made out as a bad guy, which actually makes more sense than the original. Even then, his character was haughty, and should've been a heavy. This character is the most important in the Kong movies.The hero is well over the top in liberal ideas that get a bit preachy even for a liberal like me. It is a little too "expository", and doesn't settle for a natural story line. The character is believable, but the perfection of all his actions is less than credible.This is probably the best story line of the Kong movies. It involves oil exploration, and preaches on Ecology, a worthy cause to be sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake from known story was previously adapted in the classic film(1933) by Ernerst B Schoedsack and Merian C Cooper and posteriorly remade numerous times, it concerns about an oil company whose owner (Charles Grodin, in the role of Robert Amstrong) travels on board vessel with a diverse crew(John Randolph, Ed Lauter, Jack Halloran,Rene Auberjonois, Julius Harris), towards remote island near of Indonesia. In the ship stowaway Prescott(Jeff Bridges, in similar role of Bruce Cabot) and find the castaway Dwan(Jessica Lange, in the role of Fay Wray). In the foggy island encounter to Kong, an enormous gorilla, worshipped by the natives, then Kong falls in love with starlette Dwan, the genuinely touching heroine. Being captured, is brought to civilization and transported to New York City as sideshow attraction. Kong escapes, causing wreak havoc and rampage throughout the city ; ending up on top of the newly built World Trade Center substituting to Empire State Building from the classic version. Ultimately, Kong battling armored helicopters with machine gun.Lavish production by Dino De Laurentiis is long on budget , short on credibility. Spectacular and emotive scenes, including one where Kong strips Lange and an erotic shower with original drying. Problems lingered on the set and at a high cost, it was one of the most expensive movie of its time and took time to finish. Jessica Lange film debut(at 27 years old), she didn't again for three years but she was not glad her acting. Appear uncredited with brief acting, someone almost extra, Corbin Bersen, John Lone, John Agar and Joe Piscopo.Glittering and colorful cinematography by Richard H Kline, won deservedly Academy Award nomination. Sensible and touching musical score by John Barry. At the end the producer De Laurentiis wishes to acknowledge that Kong has been designed and engineered by Carlo Rambaldi, constructed by Carlo Rambaldi and Glen Robinson, with special contributions by Rick Baker. They utilized every possible form especial effects, it reveals the genius of its creators. The picture still holds up well after more than thirty years. Followed by inferior sequel (1986, equally directed by John Guillermin,with Linda Hamilton and Brian Kerwin) in which scientific get the gorilla alive in spite of his upsetting asphalt fall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge Budget, Effort and Ape - Good for what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dino Di Laurentis' production of King Kong was a very bold move. De Laurentis was at the height of his career, having produced several successful and risky blockbusters throughout the 1970s. But the original 1933 film was an improbable masterpiece and is one of the best loved films in the American canon. The writer/director of the original - Merian C. Cooper was a relative unknown who would use Kong to launch a lengthy and acclaimed career including a number of great films traversing a number of film genres. The cast was certainly not a bunch of unknowns, but none of them had ever made a film remotely resembling this science fiction romantic adventure. There is no sense in describing the plot - it's very well known and you can find synopses elsewhere.So, director John Guilerman applied a huge special effects and casting budget and went to work on yet another De Laurentis monster-sized Hollywood film. Guilerman was a good match for De Laurentis. Fresh out of his successful "Towering Inferno" Irwin Allen disaster flick, Guilerman was ready for the challenge King Kong would give him.Wisely, he chose to stick to the original story line very closely- just changing a few of the details for the purpose of modernization. Also wisely, his casting director, the short-lived but excellent Joyce Selznick, chose actors and actresses who fit the roles established by the 1933 film with minimal alteration. - Jeff Bridges can do just about anything he sets his mind to. Charles Grodin is great at playing an ambiguously evil bumbler, Rene Auberjonois makes an excellent awkward sci-guy, and Jessica Lange (a relative unknown at the time) is stunningly beautiful and very talented. I will digress for just a moment to discuss Ms. Lange's performance. Women do not really fair very well as a class of people in either of these two films. In the original most of Faye Wray's lines consisted of screaming and wailing. The 1976 script gave Lange's character considerably more depth, but some will cringe at Lange's very provocative performance, the implication when she is discovered at the beginning of the film that she may have ended up in sex slavery had her boat not been wrecked, and the obviously exploitive and wholly unnecessary brief nude scenes. Yes... but... Lange's character (infused with the actress' remarkable sincerity) manages to develop a strength and power that Wray's character lacked, and you will have to see this film to get it.The cinematography is lavish, but very often - wisely - matches the original scene for scene. The special effects are - for their time - miraculous. Kong is just as humanized, if not more-so, as he was in the original.My only criticism is one that applies very often to big-budget Hollywood adventure and effects movies, and more specifically, to some of De Laurentis' productions of the period and which makes this film noticeably different from the original. The tempo of the 1976 King Kong caters to the typical cinema-goer's attention span. The film breezes along without very much variation in pacing, and therefore misses some opportunities to properly exploit drama and suspense. However, this critique only examines the difference between a good film and what could have been a great film, so..... enjoy! Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake from the 1933 version but,of course doesn't go with the plot of the original.It's about a man who is trying to strike oil on an island before any other oil company gets there.Meanwhile someone sneaks aboard the ship and everyone is accusing him as a spy,but he really isn't.A woman called Dwan is found unconscious in a raft and is brought aboard immediately.Soon she falls in love with Jack(the guy who sneaks on the ship).When they reach their destination, the island seems to have natives living on it,but they don't pay attention to them they're to bust looking at an oil patch.The chief sees them and offers six of his women for Dwan.They refuse but the natives take Dwan anyway and claim her the "bride of Kong".This movie has a very good story and is directed very well and a brilliant performance by Jeff Bridges.Also the scenery of the island was beautiful.The effects were terrible and the effects from the original had better.The reason I'm giving it 7 is because some acting wasn't great and at some stage it got into a pattern of boring to good and that pattern repeated over and over again.Recommended to fans of monster movies,Jeff Bridges and King Kong movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billing a remake as 'The most exciting original motion picture event of all time' is just asking for trouble, but King Kong in its 1976 incarnation isn't the turkey everyone seems to remember ? or at least not when Jessica Lange is offscreen, which sadly isn't nearly often enough. It's a wonder her career ever survived her abysmal Marilyn-without-the-intellect impersonation, all exaggerated breathy mannerisms and inane dialogue ("Did you ever meet anyone whose life was saved by Deep Throat?" ? relax, she means the movie). Parts of it are surprisingly well directed, particularly the sections a the great wall, and the updating to an oil exploration voyage effective enough, although the studio scenes are often all-too obvious and the special effects variable at best. Unfortunately, it packs considerably less into its 132 minutes than the original did in its 99, and wastes too much time on Lange instead of the big guy. Curiously, in its efforts to make Kong more sympathetic (no native villages destroyed here, with Jeff Bridges' palaeontologist, almost as hairy as Rick Baker's Kong himself, constantly on hand to protect his reputation and attempt to stop him taking the big drop) it just ends up diminishing him. Watchable enough, but it wasn't hard for Peter Jackson to top this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My very first movie .......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the very first film my father ever took me to see ..... along with "Star Wars" a few years later, it is very vivid in my mind.Of the three versions of 'Kong', I think it is clearly the worst, but I don't think it is as bad as people make it out to be. The effects are the weakness of the film. While it was much simpler to film stationary space ships in front of blue screen, this film proved just how impossible it was to make something organic too believable without relying on miniatures that, while pretty good, were still miniatures.Aside from the acting of Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange, which were pretty good, I thought that the concept of moving the action to the modern day was pretty good ... and at the same time made a statement about the times of the mid-1970s.In the era of disco and drugs, a loss of faith in leaders and an "anything goes" attitude, this film seemed to show a chink in that armor. Having recently seen this film again (along with the Peter Jackson version), I was taken that in the end Prescot wanted to pull her away (just like Driscol in the Jackson version), but in the end, when she is heart broken over Kong's death, Driscol goes to her and comforts her. Prescot consciously does not, as she is surrounded by cameras and the fame she so desperately wanted. I took this as a demonstration of the old saying "never ask for what you want, because you might just get it." In an era where everyone was out for their fifteen minutes, this film showed (albeit in a sci-fi kind of way) the tragedy that can befall that quest.I would not rank it among the greatest action or fantasy films of all time ..... but I think it is an iconic 1970s film ..... when Hollywood thought they could go back to their past and make anything automatically better than before ..... but really couldn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the legend reborn but not in the best way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's too bad, because when I look at the 1976 remake of "King Kong", and I look over its good traits that can't be ignored, I think that if only the rest of the movie was as spectacular, then this would undoubtedly be my favorite out of all three versions. And it's true that the 76 version has some qualities and characteristics are simply beautiful and perfect, yet there are other aspects that can't be ignored and ultimately ruin the movie for many viewers. This is probably the worst out of all three versions. I'm not saying its a terrible film or a total failure, but it was a missed opportunity.There were some great aspects to "King Kong", mostly its first-rate cinematography and John Barry's fantastic music score. Performances by all of the cast members, excluding Jessica Lange in some scenes, were great. Jeff Bridges and Charles Grodin were excellent in their roles. And Jessica Lange was great for her debut, for about five minutes into the film. Afterward, I kind of got annoyed by her. Maybe it wasn't her performance that bothered me, but just the character's dialogue and irritating antics. Her character smoking, acting like a bimbo, and trying to make conversation with a gorilla, just totally made this character nothing when compared to the respectable Ann Darrow from the original.Another thing about the film that did not work was Kong himself. Kong is portrayed in all of his scenes by a man in a rubber suit. And, when comparing it to 1976 technology, the suit looked good from the waist up. But from the waist down, it was totally campy and revealing. The overhead shots of Kong walking through the jungle, shots Kong climbing buildings, and fighting on top of skyscrapers were all painful to look at. At times, I could see points of the suit folding in. Thankfully, there were at least good animatronics in the head to create a somewhat realistic approach. To be honest, the only reason the suit looks passable is thanks to Richard H. Kline's skill as a cinematographer. And unfortunately, "King Kong" doesn't have the great action sequences I wanted. I wouldn't have minded seeing the man in the monkey suit fighting with other creatures, but it was disappointing to discover that the only creature he battles is one that was also poorly executed as a special effect and the fight itself was short, out of place, and almost unnecessary. The only way I could consider it "thrilling" is thanks to John Barry's thunderous, booming music score.Putting aside the two main parts about this movie that bothered me: Jessica Lange's character and the poorly done visual effects on Kong, the movie itself was pretty fun to watch. Once upon a time, I hated this version of "King Kong" and refused to watch it. But over time, I grew to like it some. There are still some parts that make me wince, but overall, it's a worthy movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy monster flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had fond memories of this film ever since I was a kid. Back then, films like Star Wars, Jaws, and the Godfather where great films and still are in this day and age of digital effects. But this film stays in my heart and having just watched a few days ago, I still love it even more. Sure the acting was a cheesy and corny at times but that's what makes this film great although the ending was very touching and almost made me cry. But the effects were great. What I liked the about the film was the interaction between Beauty and Beast (pun intended). I admit that I had a crush on Jessica Lange when I first saw her on screen in this movie. She was simply lovely in this film. Her acting didn't win her any awards but she did a fairly decent job with what material she had to work with.I loved this film. Brings back many fond memories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all three King Kong movies, I always held an appreciation for this one. I remember the shot where Kong comes out of the jungle,trees hiding his face so you can't get a good look until he towers over Jessica Lange! That is one of the things that builds suspense in the film. There are some limitations when compared to Peter Jackson's epic but also there are improvements over the original. The costume won an Oscar for Rick Baker, who designed it. I liked the story and there was plenty of action. The acting isn't on the same level as it's predecessor and some of the the scenes are corny(especially the ones with the giant robotic Kong-it doesn't move realistically). The direction and cinematography are well done and the pace moves right along. A good Kong film that is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the mid-seventies Hollywood had gone big-budget disaster movie mad. Audiences had been shaken by Earthquake, burned by Towering Inferno (directed by Kong's own Guillerman) and drowned by The Poseidon Adventure. They'd been put off flying by the Airport series and swore never to return to the water thanks to a certain shark movie. De Laurentiis felt that the time was right for yet another special effects epic, and committed $24 million to bringing Kong to a new generation (by way of comparison, Earthquake cost a mere $7 million just two years earlier). He was originally in talks with Roman Polanski to bring this new version to the screen, and one can only imagine what that movie would have been like. Unfortunately there were certain elements Polanski was unsure of (mainly, what to do with a giant ape) which meant the project was passed on to Guillerman, a veteran of the disaster movie.And here is the real crux of the matter: when you watch this film you begin to feel that NO ONE knew what to do with the ape. The film flows nicely along, and is quite enjoyable right up to the moment Kong is first revealed. The director and the cast bring some life and depth to the updated script, involving Grodin's search for a new oil source, finding shipwrecked Lange and stowaway Bridges along the way. They make it to the island and meet some of the natives; so far, so good. But when the atmosphere builds and Kong is finally revealed, it's a downhill slide from here.Kong is played through the majority of the film by special effects maestro Rick Baker. Back in the seventies if the call went out for a guy to dress as an ape, he was first in line. He made his memorable debut playing a two-headed ape in The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant, a film I heartily recommend for a terrific performance from Bruce Dern. In Kong the problems lies mainly in the fact that a man in an ape suite looks like, well, a man in an ape suit, and no amount of trick photography and miniature work disguises this. Kong looks truly ridiculous stomping his way through tiny trees and papier-mâché mountains, and especially during his climactic wrestle with a giant snake. He manages to show expression, particularly in his scenes with Lange's Dwan. Oh yes, I forgot to mention that Dawn changed her name to Dwan to sound more interesting. She states that early in the movie. Well love, it just makes you sound like an idiot. And no one else in the movie can pronounce it properly. As I was saying, Kong has several scenes with Dwan, and his main expression is one of arousal. Yes, Kong finds her sexy. Bridges refers to Kong as a "Gigantic turned-on ape", and he's not far wrong. There is a hilarious scene where Kong holds Dwan lovingly in his hand and slowly undresses her with one of his enormous pudgy fingers. I kid you not. And she lets him too, making only the smallest effort to retain her modesty.De Laurentiis did have one ace up his sleeve. Along with his man-in-suit, he had Carlo Rambaldi. Better known for his later work in E.T., Rambaldi built a fully operational, life-size Kong, reaching over forty feet in height. This was going to be the effect that would amaze the audiences. And it does. It amazes you that they bothered at all, because it hardly works, only managing the most basic of facial and body movements. In the end they only used it in a couple of scenes, and the inter-cutting between it and Baker's suit is painfully obvious. One second he's motionless, the next Kong is thrashing around violently, then he's very still again. It's like an ape version of Musical Statues.I could write all day about this movie. In short, you have to see it to believe that such a big film can be so bad, from the dialogue ("What do you think did that? A guy in an ape suit?" Er, yes?) to the scale models, which appear to have been borrowed from one of the lowest budgeted Godzilla movies. And of course, there's Kong himself, hairy and horny. All he wants is to get it on with Dwan, if only the giant snakes, evil oil companies and armed helicopters would let him.For a PG-rated film, there's a surprising amount of blood and near-nudity in this film. The transfer quality on the DVD is excellent. The film is presented in widescreen, and the audio is clean and loud. As an extra on the R2 DVD you get a bonus disc featuring the official sequel, King Kong Lives, made in 1986 and again directed by Guillerman. This film has to be seen to be believed. It is presented in full screen, and looks like it was transferred from VHS, but you will be rewarded. Linda Hamilton stars as the surgeon who saved Kong's life, courtesy of an artificial heart, but soon lives to regret it when he escapes to get it on with a certain Lady Kong, recently arrived from Borneo. The film features tender scenes of courtship between the apes, and climaxes with Lady Kong giving birth whilst King Kong takes missiles in the chest from the military. It is played dead straight, with Hamilton weeping in the corner whilst the orchestral music swells. It is one of the funniest things I've seen in quite some time. The fact that Hamilton did this movie after Terminator shows she really needed another agent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oil executive Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin) leads an expedition to a cloud shrouded island in the Indian Ocean. He thinks the cloud is from huge deposits of hydrocarbons. Primate paleontologist Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) stowaway on the ship and tells them that the cloud is caused by an unseen creature. On the way to lock up Prescott, they rescue unconscious starlet wannabe Dwan (Jessica Lange) on a life raft. Wilson brings Prescott and Dwan on shore. They are confronted by a primitive tribe who then kidnaps Dwan to be sacrificed to the great ape.I like the change of the expedition to oil exploration. However they kept Dwan as a flaky starlet. Jessica Lange is absolutely beautiful and she's funny at times. However she's way too flighty and I can see criticism of her acting. I guess it's impossible back in the day to have her be a scientist. Nevertheless it's stupid to have her be literally the damsel in distress. The special effects are basically an ape suit and well shoot cinematography. The giant ape hand looks way too mechanical. The best part is King Kong rolling the tree. While it's great to have the World Trade Center, the movie doesn't take full advantage of its height to instill fear. This is a passable light weight remake at best. It just has too many problems to be great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly, Kong spoils his own movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What sets this 1976 remake apart from other versions is that it is set in the then-contemporary 1970s, giving the story more of a modern-day feel, even today. Peter Jackson opted to set his 2005 epic during the 1930s, when the original classic was filmed. The retro setting is true to the original story and lends the film a sense of fairytale fantasy disconnect. KING KONG (1976) brings the adventure up-to-date, into the world right outside the viewers' windows.Instead of location shooting for a Hollywood film, the crew in this version comes to the mysterious island on behalf of an oil company, led by Charles Grodin's opportunistic capitalist character. Jeff Bridges plays a hippie college scientist who stows away on the voyage for a chance to explore the island and its secrets. En route they rescue a beautiful blonde aspiring actress (Jessica Lange) from a shipwreck.The contemporary update of the story works pretty well. The feeling of modern industry meets primitive jungle adventure reminds me a bit of JURASSIC PARK (1993), and the action in 1970s NYC by night calls to mind other films of the era (though I can only think of 1978's SUPERMAN). The original KING KONG (1933) was such a classic that it's fair to assume that audiences in 1976 knew what they were in for. Nobody was going to be surprised by the reveal of the giant gorilla, and the script has some fun early on with the knowing audience. (Lange mentions that her horoscope said she'd meet the "biggest person in her life". She wonders if it meant Charles Grodin.)I kinda liked this movie until, and this is crucial, the appearance of Kong. In wide shots Kong is very obviously a man in an ape suit. He moves too much like a person, standing fully erect and walking around like he owns the joint. Initially he's got a very unfriendly "angry monster" face, but after spending some time with Jessica Lange he shows his "cute smiling" face. The design extremes are a little too much for me and the combination of ape suits and animatronics never manages to blend with the "realistic" feel of the island and city settings.The human actors do a good job: Jeff Bridges as the long-haired, tree-hugging hero; Charles Grodin with mustache and sideburns, out to get rich any which way he can; Jessica Lange, in her screen debut, as the girl, gorgeous, but a little superficial; Rene Auberjonois as Grodin's scientific expert; John Randolph as the ship's captain. The stuff with the people, on the ship and on the island, is good. Unfortunately I couldn't take any of the scenes with the title character seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Event In It's Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dino de Laurentis' production of King Kong was an event when it was released. It was the much heralded A list remake of the 1933 masterpiece of the same name. It went on to become one of the top grossing films of the year and was a ratings smash when broadcast on television. Lorenzo Semple's script flirted with camp at times and was frequently witty but overall kept the scope of the screenplay epic as did director John (The Towering Inferno) Guillermin. It went on to win an Oscar for best visual effects and was nominated for two others (cinematography and sound effects). Rick (An American Werewolf in London) Baker was instrumental in bringing the mythic Kong to cinematic life in spectacular fashion. This beautifully cast film was also noteworthy for launching the career of Jessica Lange. Despite the hype and success Dino de Laurentis' King Kong never found the enduring fame of it's predecessor and is largely forgotten or dismissed. A disastrously bad sequel called King Kong Lives further sullied the reputation of this rather classy, if not classic, film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Film Of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1970's. The original 1933 King Kong is everywhere, playing on TV constantly and getting a re-release in cinemas in 1973. The fan base is growing, and the film begins to inspire future filmmakers. Though fans love the original, they thought it was time for Hollywood to do a proper remake in widescreen and in color. What came out was the 1976 Remake, which in my opinion is the best Kong film and my favorite film of all time. I'm in love with this film. It's a Beautiful Epic Magnum Opus. It's a big movie, and I mean BIG, both in scope, story, characters and effects. In 1975, producer Dino De Laurentiis had an obsession to make a film bigger than Steven Spielberg's Jaws, the top-grossing film of all-time, so he set to remake King Kong. Dino signed the deal with RKO, then out of nowhere Universal came into the scene and a titanic lawsuit battle began. With a race between the two studios on who would do it first, Dino acted fast and got the best people to help. Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s writing is very strong. Not only the love story, but also dealing with environmental issues and the horrible greed of man. This coming from the man who wrote the 1966 Batman Show. John Gullerman directed the film, giving it its incredible delivery and epic feel. The cast is perfect. Jeff Bridges is finally (Pre 76 Kong Films) an interesting protagonist, playing a man constantly switching sides, torn between love and power. Charles Grodan is a slimy hateful villain, who will stop at anything, even the safety of his fellow crew members to get his way. And in the end his death is well deserved. Finally, the beautifully gorgeous and stunning Jessica Lange, delivers an outstanding performance as the Beauty Who Charmed The Beast. Her character at first like the original is frightened of Kong, but during the time they're together, she realizes he's not a monster, he's lonely and eventually grows to love and does not want him exploited. And it's because of her that he dies. The location and sets, perfect! The Pertox Explorer is a fantastic looking ship. Though different, stays on par with The Venture from the original. Most of Skull Island was filmed on the island of Kauai, its view beautifully filmed showing the lush greenery, waterfalls and beaches. great wall looks incredible, allot of detail went into it. New York is well photographed, both real and miniature. The World Trade Center almost sparkles in the night, giving that haunting feel of the now gone structures. And the amount of extras throughout the film did a fantastic job. Which brings us to the special effects, though not as memorable as the classic Stop Motion Animation from the original are still stunning to look at. The miniature jungles, caves, houses and environment are amazing. The Giant Ape was used with many different effects, one using full scale pieces. Kong's arms, feet and even a full size Kong were created by Carlo Rambaldi, whose animatronics still look incredible to this day. Although the Kong Robot failed, the majority of Kong's full size action and incredible performance would be done by a Man In A Suit by Rick Baker. His performance is unforgettable and unbelievable both in facial features and in body. As a kid, he scared me with his vicious teeth and demonic yet innocent red eyes. And as time went on, his character grew on me, which is the whole idea of the character of Kong. The Editing is fast pace and exciting. But for those who think it's too fast, there is a solution. When Kong made a TV debut in 1979 on NBC, 45 minutes of additional scenes were cut back into the film, making the run time from 2 hours to 3. While most of the new footage is filler, its does have many elements and scenes that you feel were left out of the picture. But props to Ralph E Winters for giving us two cuts of classic 70s cinema. The Sound Effects are great. The background sounds of the jungle are soothing to listen to. Although Kong's roar is a stock dinosaur roar from The Land Unknown, some of Kong's vocals were created by legendary voice actor Peter Cullen. And his animal voice is perfect. Finally there's the music. It's by far one of the best things in the film and one of my favorite scores. Written and composed by John Barry. His score gives a very haunting romantic tone. To me this tops the Max Steiner score. The Opening is epic with its moments using an organ. But it's the love theme that sticks out, a memorable piece, leaving a tear in my eye. This is where the ending comes into play. Its strong and its big. Its suspenseful, terrifying, incredible and heartbreaking. Kong is not on the Twin Towers to fight in a classy action scene against the choppers, but to protect the one he loves, and it cost him his life. Falling from grace and broken hearten. I cry every time I see that scene. What we see hear is the greed of man. Our reaction is to hate and question what we've become. Sadly, the film is picked on and getting bashed for its unfair comparisons to the 1933 and 2005 films and I'm hating the backlash. This is its own movie with its own story. It's not supposed to be the original, it's its own take on it, meaning they can do what they want with it and not use all the original source material. It's big in scope and its version of the Beauty &amp; The Beast tale is the best adaptation. The whole movie is boiled down to the love story between Kong and Dwan and during the climax I cry every time I watch it. It's a very underrated and unappreciated film. Check it out, it's a beautiful epic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kong for the Nixon era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most unfortunate line of dialogue in the 1976 version of "King Kong" is when Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges), as proof of Kong's existence, points to jungle debris and says, "Who do you think made that mess ? some guy in an ape suit?" Unfortunately, that's *exactly* what I think.In between the original 1933 version of "King Kong" (a classic and the best version ?- no arguments allowed) and Peter Jackson's 2005 version (which put me off but obviously has its fans), there came producer Dino De Laurentiis' version ?- which, to cop a much-used phrase from Roger Ebert, knew the words but not the music.The movie attempts to "modernize" the story with a plot line that, surprisingly, is halfway serviceable. Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin), a greedy executive of an oil company named Petrox ("Pet Rocks," isn't that cute?), is sailing his crew to an uncharted island that promises hoards of oil that will help Petrox lead the way during the '70s energy crisis. It's kind of sad that the original movie's Jack Denham, a happy-go-lucky adventurer who wanted the island for an exotic movie setting, is here transmogrified into a villain. But Grodin does such a great job as the chop-licking bad guy, you're willing to settle.Stowing away on the Petrox ship is Prescott, an "environmentalist professor" who tries to show Wilson the political incorrectness of his greedy ways. But Wilson cares only to exact his pound of flesh from Prescott; the price Prescott must pay for illegally boarding the ship is to be the trip's photographer. Prescott acquiesces to this gesture surprisingly quickly.But even before we see Kong, the plot point that sinks this movie is when a would-be actress named Dwan (an unfortunate film debut for Jessica Lange) is recovered from a raft at sea. It seems that a moviemaker on an ocean liner had promised her stardom just before a fateful wave washed away the ship and everyone on it except for Dwan. But when Dwan starts spouting hippie-girl talk and predicting everyone's astrological sign, one wishes Dwan had gone down with the ship.The story proceeds very quickly to the island and through the native's ritual of sacrificing a goddess (who, of course, eventually turns out to be Dwan) to Kong. It's when Kong shows up that the movie's street cred sinks for good. After seeing an inanimate clay figure brought to astounding life in the 1933 version, it's obvious and disappointing that the long shots depict only a man in a gorilla suit (special effects artist Rick Baker) ?- although even he does a better job than the Carlo Rimbaldi-designed Kong robot, which was much ballyhooed at the time but was usable only for a few shots. (Rimbaldi went on to better things with Steven Spielberg, for whom he designed the iconic extra-terrestrial creature "E.T." But even if Kong had been more convincing, poor Jessica Lange couldn't be less convincing. You'll never realize what a fine job Fay Wray did in the original until ?- in the movie's other prize-winning howler ?- you hear Dwan shouting, "Put me down, you g****** chauvinist pig ape!" The movie's last great debit is that it looks and sounds like a 1970s TV-movie, not even a theatrical one. Despite its padded budget, the movie is so gun-shy that the exotic and scary jungle animals of the first movie are reduced here to a single, slithering snake that battles Kong. John Guillermin's direction is very pedestrian ?- no sense of dread or fun to mar the movie's workmanlike march to its inevitable conclusion. And John Barry's generic score is hardly a shadow of Max Steiner's groundbreaking work in the original.The part that should have worked better was the climax's re-imagining from the Empire State Building to the then-timely (now tragic, of course) World Trade Center. At movie's end, Lange finally starts to suggest the vulnerability that was Naomi Watts' forte in the 2005 version. But by then, it is all too little, too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most modern Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong 76 was the most modern Kong and dealt with a lot of important themes relevant to our modern way of life and how that impacts on the ecology: environmental rape, corporate greed, Third World exploitation, etc... Even themes like feminism, or issues like advancing one's career (Dwan) vs. doing the right thing (Jack). It also had the most memorable quotes like:Dwan: (to Kong) You Goddamn chauvinist pig ape! Jack Prescott: Kong! Kong! Kong! Kong! you heard them chant that! He exists. You saw the wall, right? Now who the hell do you think they're planning to give that girl to? Fred Wilson: It's some nutty religion. A priest gets dressed up like an ape and gets laid. Jack Prescott: Even an environmental rapist like you wouldn't be ass&amp;^%$ enough to destroy a unique new species of animal. Fred Wilson: Bet me. Dwan: How can I become a star because of... because of someone who was stolen off that gorgeous island and locked up in that lousy oil tank?Fred Wilson: Its not someone! Its an animal, a beast who tried to rape you. Dwan: That's not true. He risked his life to save me. Fred Wilson: He tried to rape you honey. And before you cry a lot, you should ask the natives on that island what they thought of losing Kong.Jack Prescott: Actually, they'll miss him a lot. Fred Wilson: Like leprosy. Jack Prescott: No, you're dead wrong. He was the terror, the mystery of their lives, and the magic. A year from now that will be an island full of burnt-out drunks. When we took Kong we kidnapped their god. The script is gritty and cynical. But it is thought-provoking. This is where the 1933 and the 2005 versions fall down. More fantastical like Kong skating in Central Park in the 2005 version. Good for kiddies but really... come on... as if. I lost interest after this part. You really have to suspend your disbelief. Those versions are less realistic.King Kong 76 is the best version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful When Compared To The Classic Original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong is a remake of the classic 1933 King Kong film. While special effects and technology could allow for a much better looking film, the classic is much better than this film is.Unlike the original, in this film the expedition across the ocean to Kong Island is not to find Kong. Instead they are looking for a fuel source or something but instead they find King Kong.King Kong looks OK in this film. He is portrayed somewhat similar to the original Kong, however this Kong is able to become friends of sorts with Dwan(female blonde in this film rather than Ann).One thing wrong with this film is the time it takes for Kong to appear. The whole boat ride over is bad since only one guy on the boat knows that Kong is on the island that they are heading towards. Kong also does not get into much action in a good way and I think he moves too slow and robotic like. This Kong may look good but the origainl stop motion one got to do a hell of a lot more than this one.The second main thing wrong with this film is that there are NO DINOSAURS! One of the major reasons for the original being so great was all of the dinosaurs that were on Skull Island but in this film the only creature in the film other than Kong is a giant snake.I did like Jessica Lange in this film. She did a good job and is also pretty hot. THe scene where Kong tries to strip her clothes off is pretty awesome. Also you get to see her in the shower but you do not really see anything.King Kong looks good in this film but the lack of dinosaurs and action make it an average film at best. I probably overrated it just because of Jessica Lange. It is worth seeing once though at the very least.</fullReview>

If Jessica Lange's dippy film debut doesn't get to you, then Jeff Bridges bee hive looking beard surely will.(the thing is gigantic.) Altho the guy in the Kong suit manages a decent performance. Seeing Charles Grodin meet his match in a way I shan't spoil almost makes the film worth sitting thru. Not really as bad as its stinky reputation, it still doesn't look that great or hold up too well over time. The shots of the WTC will no doubt forever be difficult to watch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best version of Kong by far. It is the only version of King Kong that has something relevant to say and it has sensuality like no other and it does so with a full range of moods and emotions.I get the feeling that "irony" is an alien concept to some of the other reviewers here. It has a magnificent John Barry score, a great cast and a billion times more soul than any CGI crap !! The prior DVD issue with the correct cover from the original poster is still out there if you look. The image shown here is the cheap re-release cover.What I want is a restoration edition as some of the sensual shower/ waterfall scene has been sliced down/off no doubt so to get access to big retail outlets in Christian Fundamentalist areas of the USA.Do not allow the high-school mentality peer-pressure to convince you against this film.This version of King Kong can touch you like no other !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was it just me or was King Kong a man in a monkey suit? The overall plot was so stupid, we have people who want to drill for oil to take it take it back to New York. Hmm, it is pretty hard to drill for oil when you are riding in a tanker, and you have no equipment to do it with. The oil they did find was too fresh????? And the oil workers were morons, typical of Hollywood.The acting was horrible, every shot of Kong with Ann looked as if Kong was in a strip club watching his favorite dancer. The woman would not shut up, she screamed every moment with Kong, and was completely helpless when a dangerous situation can about. I also liked the fact that after Kong got shot; he collapsed on top of the world trade center, rolled off, fell all the way down, hit the bottom, and still was alive.Seriously, I do not like movies of hippies cheering at the deaths of our service members (which they did when Kong killed the men with the flame throwers). Save your time and watch the new King Kong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the woefully bad KING KONG remake, the thing that struck me was this: it continuously amazes me that John Barry keeps coming up with amazing scores for such amazingly bad films. How does he do it? Barry's score for KING KONG is not his greatest but it's still memorable, which is more than I can say for the entire film. KING KONG epitomizes everything that was so bad about that decade's crop of studio-produced blockbusters. It just bad on all front. The acting is cringe worthy : Jeff Bridges keeps running his hands in his long hair. Lange keeps her mouth open all the time. The FX are truly awful. The whole thing has a chintzy studio-bound look and feel that made the then super-expensive film look super cheap. Even Rob Bottin's KONG suit is unimpressive, certainly KONG's face, which appears to be frozen in a pinched expression that makes him look, well, unattractive. The characters behave in illogical or idiotic ways. For example, after surviving the subway train attack, where countless of people have been killed, and running away from an angry Kong, Dawn nonchalantly asks Jack to buy her a drink. Huh? But the thing that sinks this total fiasco is the dialogue. I've never heard such bad dialogue outside an Ed Wood film.'There is a girl out there who might be running for her life from some gigantic turned-on ape."Or "You're an Aries" Dwan says to Jack. "I can tell, from the shape of your earlobes."BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's OK I guess...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the completion of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center as New York City's tallest and most Iconic structures, it was obvious that filmmakers were going to involve these two buildings in a monster movie somewhere along the line, and most likely have the monster climb the towers, jump from one tower to the other, or stand on both towers at the same time, you get the idea. Being one of the most famous monsters to ever rock Manhattan with his presence, King Kong was certainly one for the running and so in 1976, King Kong made another appearance in the City that Never Sleeps. Starring Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange, the film I find is quite good in some aspects but falls down in others.The story is the basic Ape Escape drama, a group of explorers come across a backwater island where native's attempt to sacrifice Jessica Lange's character to King Kong who forms a relationship with the girl only to find himself fighting a giant snake or dinosaur which allows Jeff Bridge's character to save Jessica Lange's character which leads Kong into a trap set by a wealthy businessman who wants to exploit the towering beastie in order to add millions onto the millions he's already got but Kong escapes and goes on a rampage in New York eventually leading to the capture of Jessica Lange's character which results in Kong climbing the tallest building around and eventually being shot down by aeroplanes or helicopters which results in the emotional death scene at the end...So that's the story, what about the rest. To be honest, the acting is quite good even though it has been made really very 70s with some of the essentially 'hippee' undertones by Jeff Bridges character. Jessica Lange is the pretty air-headed damsel in distress who really can't keep out of harm's way for more than five or six minutes. The model work is pretty good, especially with King Kong taking Subway Trains and throwing them through the air before beating up Military Helicopters and the soundtrack is also fairly good as well. Although many people have panned this film because it's been considered a cheap knock off of the 1933 masterpiece, I don't think so to be perfectly honest, it's quite quirky in it's own way and remain's pretty faithful to the story. I'd recommend it as a Wet Saturday Afternoon sort of film, but apart from that, it's nothing superbly special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the movie, it scared the daylights out of me, but there were several things that bothered me. First, the whole politically correct 'greedy oil company bad guy vs young environmentalist long-haired hippie good guy' bothered me then and still bothers me now. Also, for as long as the movie was, there were scenes that were just kind of spliced together in a way that made no sense. When Kong comes across the band of sailors crossing the log bridge, he appeared out of nowhere. I mean, first he wasn't there and then a split second later, he was standing right on top of them, roaring at the top of his lungs! Finally, the 50' tall mechanical Kong used in the scene where he breaks out of his cage is absurd. It looks absolutely nothing like the man in the ape suit. For years, I thought it was supposed to actually be a mechanical Kong, but after I bought the DVD, I realized that the director wanted you to think that it was really Kong. Hey, otherwise, it was a fun movie. When I saw Kong brake through that wall on Skull Island on the big screen at the theater, my girlfriend and I nearly passed out! Good time!</fullReview>

Rick Baker's monkey suit fails as a special effect and the whole bizarre King Kong wants to rape Anne Darrow storyline does not work. In fact its creepy. The whole movie just doesn't wash. There are good ideas here, a lot of them pulled off in the 2005 Peter Jackson version. This is a movie to watch for laughs (there are a few) but this version is by far the weakest of the three.

		<fullReview>King Kong is a remake of the 1933 classic of the same title that tells the story of a about a giant ape that is captured and imported to New York City for exhibition. It features Jeff Bridges, Charles Grodin, and Jessica Lange in her first film role.When an extraordinary giant-sized ape is discovers in Skull Island,a paleontologist was assigned into capturing him so that it can be arranged for public display and exploitation.But when a beautiful woman was shipwrecked on the said island,she is kidnapped by the ape and the get attracted to her.When the woman was rescued,King Kong decides to go to New York and wreak havoc into the city to seek Dwan again.The city was placed into danger until he faced his demise on the Wolrd Trade Center.Obviously,the Dino De Laurentiis production is a straightforward remake with modern special effects, and naturalistic performances by the actors as compared to the 1933 version.But the performances of the cast was somewhat funny and so is the screenplay despite the fact that it does not intend to be.Obviously,Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange became better as both moved on to become Oscar winners and talented performers after their somewhat comedic participation in the film.Overall,it may not be a good film but it manages to have better special effects compared to the original due to De Laurentiis and the advancement in film technology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High adventure and... Jessica Lange</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this '76 version of "King Kong" I was disappointed that the dinosaurs contained in the original were no where to be found; and the giant snake just didn't cut it. One of the best features of the original is the thrilling Skull Island sequences with numerous dinosaurs. The Skull Island part on this '76 version is lethargic by comparison (that is, AFTER Kong appears and kidnaps Dwan).The next time I saw it I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. You gotta respect the fact that the filmmakers went for something different than the original. It's like they said, "Dinosaurs? We don't need no stinkin' dinosaurs!" What they went for, instead, was to highlight Kong's human-ness and how awestruck he was by Dwan's beauty.For instance, Kong walks more like a human than an ape. Apparently Rick Baker, the man in the Kong suit, wanted to walk like an ape but wasn't allowed. This is fitting because, again, the film attempts to emphasize Kong's human-ness.As far as comparisons to the original film and the 2005 version, if we're honest about it this '76 version, albeit flawed, is better or just as good in many areas. Although the original is a masterpiece considering its era, it has quite a few obvious flaws aside from its datedness, e.g. Jack's premature declaration of love for Ann, the blandness of the characters (except Fay), the natives' kidnapping of Ann (Why sure!) and the goofy appearance of Kong himself (all the dinosaurs look great but they couldn't come up with a better, more authentic look for the film's star monster, even though they had apes in zoos to compare with?). As for the 2005 version, it's a fun film but seriously marred by cartooney overkill. It plays out like a Road Runner cartoon more than anything else. It's just impossible to suspend disbelief while watching it.So what's good about this '76 version? - The film has a serious vibe of high adventure. The ship scenes and the initial island sequences with the tribe are great. Take, for instance, when they discover the great wall, ominous music and all.- The score by John Barry is exceptional.- The three main characters are both memorable and likable -- Jack (Jeff Bridges), Dwan (Jessica Lange) and Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin). Bridges in particular makes a distinctive long-haired protagonist. This wasn't the case in the original. Although Fay Wray was fine, the two male leads are bland and forgettable. Even though Fred (Grodin) is a greedy opportunist in this '76 version he's still kinda likable. For instance, he could have kept Jack locked up the entire trip but chooses to give him a job instead. Also, he could have tried to hog all the profits from Kong's capture but shares the 'success' with others, including Dwan and Jack (even though Jack ultimately declines).- The film's worth watching just to catch Jessica in her curvy physical prime. The scenes of her after their initial arrival to the mysterious island are unforgettable! Lange is dressed in skimpy jean shorts and a striped billy shirt and she's just incredible. No wonder Kong became fascinated with her.- The Kaua'i, Hawaii, locations are magnificent! The other two versions don't hold a candle to these breathtaking locations, including Jackson's cartooney CGI jungles.- Kong looks best in this version. Yes, it's just a guy in an ape suit but it works. His facial expressions are great. Kong looks so much better in this version compared to the original that there really is no comparison. Of course, Kong looks great in the 2005 remake as well, but Jackson basically just made Kong out to be a gargantuan gorilla. By contrast, in the original and '76 version Kong is a huge ape with human qualities. I prefer the huge human-like ape over the (mere) giant gorilla.- This version is more adult-oriented and believable. Skull Island is a mysterious island with large animals but no dinosaurs. This makes more sense. The thrilling dino-scenes have been omitted in favor of sequences of a more dramatic nature. I prefer the thrilling dino-encounters but have to respect the risk-taking originality and believability of this version.- This is the only version that shows Kong being transported from the island to the U.S.A. Quite a bit of runtime is devoted to it, in fact.- The World Trade Center (RIP) is featured and the ending is pretty gory; you can't help but sympathize with Kong.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: - The giant ape hand/arm gets the job done but that's about it. It's used too often and moves too slow.- Likewise, the giant snake is okay but that's about it. This sequence required a thrilling battle between two colossal creatures and what we get is pretty weak and forgettable.- The studio sets for the island look fake; they're not much better than the sets seen on the original Star Trek TV series. They should have stayed with the great Kaua'i locations instead of lame studio sets.- The footage of the 40-foot mechanical ape prop shown in the last act for about 4 seconds should have been left on the cutting room floor. It's horrible.Some have criticized that this version is campy but, really, the only remotely campy aspect is the Charles Grodin character. Besides, is he all THAT campy? I've met people like him in real life (take, for instance, when he steps out of the boat on the island to the vainglory of the camera's eye -- it rings true).Aside from Jessica Lange, what I like most about this film is its spirit of high adventure. If you're in the mood for serious high adventure you can't go wrong with this version of "King Kong." GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redundant remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It sure is hard to get too enthused about this rather redundant remake of the 1930s original. Made by Dino de Laurentiis in the mid-70s, when the craze for explosive disaster epics was at its peak, KING KONG suffers in comparison to the original in every respect. The script feels slow and stilted, and the film is way overlong, playing out an all-too-familiar story at boring length.It doesn't help that Kong himself is so laughable. Played by Rick Baker in a gorilla suit, he's chucklesome even at the most serious of times (although thank goodness they didn't go with the clunky Carlos Rambaldi model which appears for one brief instant during Kong's escape). The dominating presence of a guy in a suit for most of the film brings to mind the old Toho Godzilla films, to which this is closely linked. Yet those Japanese movies are fun, action-packed and entertaining, for the most part everything that KING KONG isn't.I don't know why Jessica Lange (in her gorgeous debut) was asked to play one of the biggest bimbos ever put in a mainstream movie, but it really doesn't pay off. Jeff Bridges, as the activist/hippy lead, is hardly sympathetic either, and Charles Grodin's corporate bad guy is never evil enough to be truly hissable. Too many of his scenes are played for laughs, and I couldn't help recalling MIDNIGHT RUN. What does that leave on the acting front? A few familiar faces in minor roles ? Rene Auberjonois, Julius Harris, Ed Lauter, John Lone ? none of whom have enough screen time to make much of an impact.Of course, the larger-than-life storyline is still interesting ? how could it not be? ? and I enjoyed the different, then-topical slants to the script, such as the debate on conversation vs. exploitation. Despite my preference for the '30s stop-motion model, I always enjoy watching monsters tearing up the skyline, and scenes like the one where Kong derails a train are inherently entertaining. But there's no forgetting that this is a silly, dated remake, one that's inferior in every respect to the '30s movie which, like Kong, dwarfs everything else in comparison.</fullReview>

There still some predictable things in the movie like always but not enough to ruin the movie. There like no comedy so that's the sucky thing about it but it does have that suspense feel to it and the music add to it. I like how even throw you couldn't understand the natives; they used great body language to show what they were saying. I like how they used the camera view as if you were looking through King Kong's eyes. I think some of the acting was too much and compare to the things they can do now the graphic looked weak you can see some times king Kong move and look like a robot which was kind of funny. Also as the movie goes on the action picks up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems as if they now intend to remake this once every generation or so, figuring that the new younger audience is so ignorant, so lacking in interest of anything beyond their own body sheaths, that they won't realize they're watching a remake. And why should they? The stars will be different, the special effects improved, the gore increased, perhaps more nudity. Well, maybe not the nudity. We want to appeal to twelve-year old minds so we have to get them in the theaters. At this point I'm no longer sure it's possible to make another successful movie about an untamed brute savagely stalking through the streets of New York unless it's a biography of Donald Trump.The original, which appeared in the early 1930s, had something important going for it, both from an artistic and a commercial perspective. It was an ORIGINAL. Somebody dreamed it up after multiple tokes on a long pipe. Everything since then, including "Mighty Joe Young," has been merely an adaptation. Update the issue and the dialog, introduce some current slang, mix, and serve at room temperature.This isn't original but it's not bad either, taken as a good example of how to update a classic. Not an easy job. (Today, Charles Foster Kane would have to be a Rupert Murdoch figure.) Jeff Bridges has long hair and a beard and spouts eco-speak. Kong's capture and removal from the island leaves him chagrined. They've ruined the island and its natives by robbing them of their god. Soon they'll be no more than burned out drunks. In the original, Bruce Cabot in the same role had no such problem. That's what I mean by "updating." Similarly, the succulent Jessica Lang, as "Dwan," aspiring movie star, is into astrology and feminism -- already on their way to obsolescence by 1975. Fay Wray had a coincidental wardrobe malfunction when surfacing in the water after her monumental drop from the top of a cliff. Here, Kong's fingertip seems to deliberately pull down Lang's the top of her elasticized native dress, not that any forbidden body parts are glimpsed, only hinted at. (Where did they get the elastic? No matter. The point is not the elasticity of Lang's dress but the elasticity of her bosom.) Charles Grodin is not Robert Armstrong, showman and human being. He's a corporatist monster, greedy, ambitious, and sniveling.It would be nice if the ecological message were to register with viewers but I'm afraid most viewers, as of the time I write this, will dismiss his concerns as so much elitist paranoia. After all, he's from Princeton and knows how to spell, so his distress is easily dismissed as elitist baloney.Critics at the time were disappointed in the film. They had been promised computer-generated visual effects and here, most of the time, as far as they could tell they were given only a man in a well-done gorilla suit. They must have had their fill of CGIs by now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People seem to bash this movie a lot. For good reasons. it is desperately inferior to the original.As a kid, I liked this one, though I preferred the original, sure it's in Colour, Stereo (now 5.1) and it has "better" special effects. True: The man-in-a-suit approach doesn't always work, but so does stop motion. It is maybe the best they could have come up with in the seventies, without having to call in Ray Harryhausen.The actors are good, there's nothing wrong with the acting. the music by John Barry has you thinking James Bond'll show up any minute and rescue the girl. AlasI think the biggest problem with this movie is the script.The pacing is too slow and doesn't have a lot of action... or monsters. But boy, do we want to see the inhabitants of Kong island! Especially with the new and improved special effects.After seeing this movie after so many years, I realize they tried to make the characters believable, with each a credible reason to set foot on king island. The result, is a slow start, which is just bearable not to fast forward the movie. And when they reach Kong Island, the biggest disappointment, is the lack of inhabitants for Kong to fight with. When Kong's finally captured (after 1,5 hrs of movie, you still have about 45 minutes before he falls to his Death from the World Trade Centre.Okay, I know, also long and at times slow. but that version succeeded in making the slow bits compelling enough not to lose interest. And it had a lot of Kong's island and creatures.Having said that, the 1976 version is not as bad as some people want you to believe. it's not as good as some want you to believe either. I think it's a mediocre attempt in to remaking a classic. The resulting movie is worth to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good but I have happy memories about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first (and virtually forgotten) remake of "King Kong". This one has an oil company called Petrox going to Skull Island to get oil. The expedition is run by evil Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin). Nice guy Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges looking like a hippie) is a stowaway who becomes their photographer. They find beautiful Dwan (Jessica Lange in her movie debut) stranded in the middle of the ocean. They get to the island, Dwan is offered as a sacrifice to Kong--but he falls in love with her. He's captured and bought to New York where he breaks loose and climbs the Word Trade Center with Dwan in his clutches.OK--this is not a good movie. However I saw it at the age of 14 in a movie theatre and was blown away by it. I found it big, exciting, funny and sad. Also people seem to forget that this DID have defenders. There were many positive reviews--even the legendary critic Pauline Kael gave it a good review in "The New Yorker"! Still this has been regarded as a total bomb and derided from all sides. But I prefer this over that overblown Peter Jackson remake that ran an unnecessary three hours.First of all the special effects are great. Kong's face is incredibly expressive. You can SEE what he's feeling. Also I do like the fact that Lange doesn't scream nonstop like Fay Wray did in the original. The scenes between her and Kong include incredible special effects--and some of the most laughable lines in screen history! Lange TALKS to the ape--"You g**damn chauvinist pig ape!" "I'm a Libra. What sign are you?" I mean COME ON!!!! There are plenty of things wrong with this though. The dialogue is dreadful--full of stupid jokes that are meant to be ironic (I guess). Get a load of the (very obviously) fake giant snake Kong fights on Skull Island! When they hit New York continuity goes flying out the window. Kong (somehow) finds Dwan in a small underground bar. No way that could happen. Also he's trampling down some oddly quiet streets in Manhattan--yet minutes later they're full of people. And the ending was just needlessly bloody. And HOW did Dwan get from the top of the World Trade Center to the street in a matter of minutes? Also seeing the World Trade Center (which no longer exists) might remind some people of the horrific 9/11 tragedy. As for the acting--Lange does what she can. Bridges is good if way too earnest. Grodin is just terrible.So--it is NOT a good movie but childhood memories die hard. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy but irresistible B-grade remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: A campy remake that's quite a bad movie, but quite hard to truly dislike. No one said it would be a good idea to remake a film that a.) had nothing going wrong with or b.) if there's no innovation it needs or you can give it. So why remake KING KONG in 1976? Who knows? This big-budgeted (although it seems hard to see why) but extremely goofy remake of the classic monster movie is heavily (and I mean heavily) flawed, but sometimes, you just fall in love with a film that tries to be something and fails. If this is a bad movie I must agree, but it's actually quite watchable (but that really depends on how you look at the thing). Changing everything from characters and plot, the film is a loose remake of the first film. Instead of bringing back the characters of the original, this film spawns new characters. The male lead is now named Jack Prescott (played by a young Jeff Bridges), a stowaway who unwittingly joins an expedition of the Petrox oil company, lead by a Fred Wilson (a pre-comedian Charles Grodin) who goes in search of an island where there is supposed to be an expensive kind of oil that could earn them millions. Instead of Fay Wray screaming it all over again as Ann Darrow, this remake casts a new female star to play a different character. This actress is none other than a very young Jessica Lange, in her memorable screen debut, and she plays Dwan, a shipwrecked girl. Lange is fun to watch as she ball clowns in her role.What happens later is all to familiar to you. The girl is kidnapped by the natives and offered as a sacrificial bride to their god Kong, who instantly falls for the captive maiden. Kong here is no longer a stop-motion model as the original Kong was in 1933, and is replaced with a stunt man in a gorilla suit. This is created by Rick Baker, who is also the guy sweating it out inside the suit. The effects look really goofy, even for its age. It's like those goofy man-in-a-suit monsters starring in those Toho films from Japan. The acting, even for the appealing Ms. Lange, is awfully weak. The screenplay, by Lorenzo Semple Jr., is pretty weak and takes itself too seriously with not much evident fun.But still, I found it hard to hate this goofy old movie. Although I couldn't really say I liked it, you got to admit it took a lot of guts to be made! Rating: **1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best version of King Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I will go ahead and come right out and say it -- I've seen all 3 of the big budget King Kong movies and I enjoyed this one the most of all. The effects certainly aren't as groundbreaking or classic as Willis O'Brien's effects for the original, but in general it's not fair to judge a movie just based on effects. The original movie has a pretty good script but unfortunately the directors had no clue how to get a performance out of actors -- just look at how badly they botched Joel McCrea's performance in "The Most Dangerous Game" as well. The people in Cooper and Schoedsack's movies always seem like they are reading off cue cards. In contrast, in this movie we have a trio of real gutsy and interesting performers, Jeff Bridges as Jack, Jessica Lange as Dwan, and Charles Grodin as Fred Wilson, a stand-in for Carl Denham in the other 2 versions. The changes made to the characters really work well in the movie's favor in my opinion. Instead of just being some random actor with almost no personality, in this version Jack is a scientist who stows away on the boat to Skull Island. Because he's a zoologist, he has a connection to Kong that Jack in the other films did not have, and he feels more a real part of the film and less of an obligatory presence than he does in the other versions. In fact it's a very interesting situation -- Jack cares about Kong and he thinks that Kong is getting a raw deal, but only Dwan can actually get close to Kong. There's an element of jealousy in Jack's attitude towards Kong (notice how in the scene with Kong on the ship, the director cuts from the shot of Jack frustrated with Dwan to a shot of Kong sleeping) but he overcomes it and ends up trying to save Kong's life towards the end. I would say that making Jack a more substantial character was probably the major factor that pushes this film above the other versions. Not to mention that Jeff Bridges is a heck of a lot more interesting actor than Robert Armstrong or Adrian Brody. That's not to say that this is Jeff Bridges' greatest moment as an actor, but I loved how he played the character and made him so different from the other men in the movie (which is a HUGE problem with the other two versions), and I love the passion we can feel from him when he talks about how they've actually destroyed Skull Island's culture by stealing Kong ("we've stolen the magic and the mystery of their lives").Charles Brodin is also great in this movie, way more convincing as an underhanded manipulator than Jack Black or Bruce Cabot. I like the idea of turning him into an oil man, and it's hilarious how quickly he makes the transition from oil to show business. I haven't read a lot of comments or reviews about this movie but I wonder if people have just not noticed a lot of the really amusing satirical aspects of this version. I thought it was fantastic at the end when you have the re-enactment of Kong's capture of Dwan, and instead of taking place in a generic nightclub like the other two, we have this bizarre set piece of a gigantic gas pump being wheeled out to the sacrificial altar. It's like the film is saying -- native people worship Kong, and civilized people worship big oil. It speaks very strongly to the fetishism of our particular culture, much as the original film made the connection between the Empire State Building and the mountains of Skull Island (in this film somewhat unfortunately it's the World Trade Center instead).Then not to leave out Ms. Lange, of course this again isn't her best role but I like what she brings to this film. She really does seem like a bimbo in the early parts, and looks just fantastic. I can believe the changes and the maturity that her character is finding through coming into contact with Kong.A lot of people have complained about the effects in this version, specifically the monkey suit designed by Carlo Rambaldi and Rick Baker. First of all the animatronic head is fantastic, the amount of expression they got from it is very impressive. The animatronic hand, less so... it looks like plush vinyl. The sets that were built for this film, especially the huge wall, are very impressive as well. In the new version of course everything is digital and looks like a video game for the most part. By the way, the snake that Kong fights is obviously the same one that Conan fought in DeLaurentis' "Conan the Barbarian" with a different head put on it (Kong got rid of the original head there). Now, I like stop motion as much as the next guy. DeLaurentis could have hired Jim Danforth or Ray Harryhausen to do some effects for this movie. But in my opinion stop motion is not a good option for a contemporary story shot in color. I think combining miniatures with matte shots was the right approach. This is a film with its tongue in cheek, lots of good honest laughs to go along with the action and pathos. I love how arrogant and at the same time naive Grodin's character is, I laughed out loud when he landed on Skull Island and said, "We don't want to get eaten alive on this island! Bring the mosquito spray." And we don't have to hear his character say that lame line about "It was Beauty that killed the Beast" like we do in the other two versions, he just gets squashed like he should be.Watch closely for a guest appearance by John Agar and listen closely for a quick homage to Hitchcock (the beast heads "North by Northwest" at one point).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a scene in this remake where Jeff Bridges says 'Who the hell do you think went through there, some guy in an ape suit?', which might have worked better if Kong wasn't brought to life using a guy in an ape suit. Despite being an ostensibly lavish production there are times when it all looks hopelessly cheesy.The full-size animatronic Kong is seen for about three shots, the rest of the movie focusing on the aforementioned bloke in a costume or a giant plastic hand. In the scenes with Jessica Lange (whose performance isn't that great, but man, she is utterly beautiful) it's never convincing that she and Kong are really there together, it's all too artificial. The visual effects in the finale are far more impressive, but by that point the movie had lost me. For all its faults (and there are many, as it's completely overrated) the original film was far more effective in this department.The performances are equally wobbly; everyone seems distracted, although Charles Grodin delivers a few laughs. The tone is uncertain, too, jokey one minute and dark the next. It's a big, ungainly thing that takes ages to get going and rushes its ending, so it never really finds its feet in any way. It's certainly better than the belated sequel, 'King Kong Lives', which was utterly awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost A Great Re-Make But the 2005 Kong Is Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stars Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange, Charles Grodin, John Randolph, Renee Auberjonois, Julius Harris, Jack O'Halloran.Released in 1975, this film is the first of two remakes of the classic 1933 King Kong, the second and latest being Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong. The B budget film director from Italy, Dino Di Lorentis (2000 years B.C.) is behind the production for this version and that's probably why this film failed miserably. To this day, most people regard this film as a really bad re-make, most notably in King Kong himself, an actor in an ape suite. There are times one forgets its a guy in a costume (like the scene when he abducts a shrunken Anne played by Jessica Lange) but often times we know its a guy in costume such as the scene when he wreaks havoc in New York City. Jessica Lange plays Anne in an entirely different manner than Fay Wray, who screams throughout most of the original film. Instead of being scared of Kong and clearly a victim, Jessica Lange portrays her as a woman who takes on a kind of liberal's interest in the "endangered" ape and has genuine feelings for him. She is subdued, charming and sexy and doesn't scream at all. I like the scene in which she explains how she was saved from drowning from the ship she was taking on a filming shoot. The crew had invited her to see the classic 70's porno film "Deep Throat", she refused and consequently was saved during the shipwreck. Jeff Bridges has great chemistry with Lange and he, too, is liberal at heart and likes the great big ugly ape, too. This is probably because the 70's was a time when environmentalists, "tree-huggers" and animal activists were blooming. This movie is a document of New York City in the 70's. The cinematography is lovely. I didn't give this movie a really low rating because it has its moments. The island is gorgeous. There's a scene in which Lange showers underneath a waterfall. The use of the Twin Towers in place of the Empire State Building is also a nice touch, and a sort of film tribute to those precious towers that were destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001. While this is not the best re-make, this is still a so-so movie. But without question the best is Peter Jackson's newest release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst. Remake. Ever. Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we all know, there are three versions of King Kong. The 1933 version, this version, and the 2005 version by peter Jackson. Jackson's Kong was amazing, 1933 King Kong was meh, and this King Kong is just utter trash. First of all, the story. Boy, does it stink. First of all, the villain is somebody working to drill oil on skull island. What? What did the other king kongs have to do with oil? They didn't! Plus, (my biggest problem in this film) there are no dinosaurs! Dinosaurs are what made the other 2 movies so entertaining. The director of this piece of garbage removed the dinosaurs because "they interfered with the love story". Well, King Kong is not supposed to be a love story! It's an adventure story! Plus, the characters are very weak. Dwan was just a stupid ditz whose attitude got pretty annoying, and the other characters aren't even remotely interesting. Also, the effects stink! Kong is obviously someone in a gorilla suit. I don't even know what more to say. It just stinks. If you want to see a remake of King Kong, see Jackson's version. This is a King Kong you can definitely skip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching King Kong (1976) on AMC (American Movie Classics), which was shown head to head against the original King Kong on TMC (Turner Movie Channel), which also demonstrates the huge gap in the quality of the respective channels the high road vs. the lowest common thread.I've recently watched the original and thought I would give the 1976 version another go, the only other time I saw it, was when it was first released and I was in my late teens, and a King Kong mania struck NYC, there were even King Kong candy bars! To my surprise the film has gotten worse with time, but it was just as funny to watch this time as the first go around. This has to be one of the worst films of all time, and one of the worst remakes, and we now live in a time where many films are remakes of earlier works and most (studio) films are dreadful. The low budget British, man in a monkey suit, film Konga (1961) was a much more entertaining take on King Kong than this dreck! Even the Japanese versions where Kong takes on Godzilla (east Vs. west),and a giant robot King Kong were more fun. Here is a film that evokes absolutely no feelings for or from any of its characters. I think they really tried to be serious in this production, but it only turns out unwittingly comical, when Kong escapes his bonds and stomps on Charles Grodin all you can do is laugh. Every time Jeff Bridges (Who really is a fine actor) mugs a serious look at the camera, another laugh, and one of my favorite laughs take place on top of the WTC when Jessica Lange begs for Kong to hold her.I won't even go into how badly the film was constructed; high school students do a better job. The only reason to see this film is to help you appreciate the original that much more. Now Peter Jackson has turned Merrian C Cooper's creation in to his own, it seems to have a lot of CGI, which high school students are also very good at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most radical film of the 1970s?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'King Kong' is one of the notorious flops in Hollywood history, a species less rare than a berserk, lovelorn gorilla in the late 70s. 'Heaven's Gate' has taught me to ignore history and the public (a certain minor folly in 1941 was also loudly fanfared and loudly ignored); while David Thomson advised me that 'Kong' was actually a sophisticated black comedy. I am not as intelligent as Mr. Thomson, so I wasn't able to find any of this humour, which, considering it features a giant primate who can understand English and loves a bad Marilyn impersonator, is pretty impressive. Whatever potency the material had in the early days of sound, when novel spectacle excused poor acting and worse plotting, surely in the late 1970s it was ripe for ridicule, the full-on camp treatment. But no, the filmmakers go for an admirable earnestness, and not even the kind of po-face that seems silly. Everything is played unnervingly straight, even the curious central love affair, so there is not even sneering relief. In fact, there is very little adaptation of the original material, making it seem eerily old-fashioned in in the age of 'Jaws' and 'Star Wars' - even the 'special' effects have that clunky black-screen mismatching of live action and animation so familiar from early fantasy films. 'Kong''s satire and critique moves from vague anti-colonialism to a more obvious (and more hypocritical, or did everyone give their pay-check to the poor?) anti-capitalism, with the big game hunters of Victorian mythology replaced by oil interests, consciously (if erroneously) modelling themselves on 'great' conquistadors of the past. This pinpointing of American globalisation/colonialism is welcome from Hollywood in the 1970s, especially in the light of its obscene foreign policy record of that time; Guillermin links its aggression to the kind of large-scale showbiz razzledazzle that, even today, throws enough glitter and noise at the people to prevent them from thinking; and to sexual inadequacy, repression and neurosis. Kong is a giant, distinctive beast with a material reality; but he is also an embodiment of the sexual frustrations of all the aggressive men on the boat, far away from home and a bordello, with a woman on board they'd love to ravish, but are too 'civilised' to try. More particularly, he is Jack Prescott's Id, the bestial urges of the scientist who on three occasions comes close to having sex with Dwan, and each time is frustrated. This link is made explicit when she gives Kong the same star sign as Prescott. The film seems to be suggesting that if America minded its own business a little more, stopped trying to hoodwink and bully every little nation that got in its way or didn't fall on its knees in gratitude, and spent a little more time making love, the world would be a better place. These hippy sentiments do not preclude rather old-fashioned racial stereotypes repeated to the extent where the island people actually disappear from the screen after their plot work is done, and they've sacrificed Dwan. There's nothing inherently wrong with 'Kong'; there have been far less intelligent films that have made fortunes. I just found it a little dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ape-tastrophe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In any APE movie, the quality of the movie is entirely dependent on the Ape Effects: the original *King Kong* (1933) was a revolution in stop-motion special effects; *Mighty Joe Young* (1949) continued that legacy; 1968's *Planet of the Apes* boasted state-of-the-art creature makeup coupled with attentive simian performances; *Greystoke* (1984) pushed the limits of performance and makeup with Tarzan's ape cousins; Peter Jackson's 2005 *Kong* remake was a stunner on seamless effects?. But in 1976, producer Dino de Laurentiis decided to go Godzilla on us by putting a guy in a gorilla suit? Dja ever notice the ape extras in *Planet of the Apes* - those background chimps with the masks just placed loosely over their heads? Even they looked better than Dino's Kong.Directed by John Guillermin, the original Kong story is re-written limply for no reason by Lorenzo Semple Jr.; starring Jeff Bridges as a primate biologist (hairier than the eponymous ape star), Jessica Lange (playing the bimbo starlet as if constantly on the brink of orgasm) and a guy in an ape suit walking around like a guy in an ape suit.The saddest irony is that the guy in the ape suit is none other than RICK BAKER, renowned makeup artist ? the maestro actually responsible for the innovative ape characters in *Greystoke*! (This was early in his career, at a point when he had only done makeup effects for a handful of films, two of which were featured on *Mystery Science Theater 3000*, which should indicate their "quality.") To lower the bar even more, this movie actually won an Oscar for its "visual effects" - Special Achievement Award (read "special" as in Olympics).Charles Grodin plays the entrepreneur character that kidnaps Kong from his jungle island and brings him to America to advertise his oil company. Kong escapes. Cue Running-and-Screaming. In what is unintentionally the funniest scene, when Kong escapes, Grodin runs TOWARDS the ape and then lies on the ground screaming, with his arm warding off the camera zoom for a full ten seconds before Kong steps on him. Gotta love bad editing. In this version ? where all the characters have been re-wrought for no special reason (well, maybe for that "Special Olympics" reason), Kong doesn't climb the Empire State but the World Trade Center buildings. Instead of biplanes, fighter jets shoot him down.Though it is reprehensible, *King Kong 1976* is still not as egregious as *King Kong Lives* (1986) - an actual sequel to THIS movie, where Linda Hamilton discovers Kong has lived after falling 110 storeys and gives him a giant heart transplant (donated from, uh, where?), whereupon Kong escapes with his chick (another giant gorilla ? female) and goes on a rampage, walking around New York upright like a guy in an ape suit.Now isn't that special?!</fullReview>

If this movie went before the ratings board today, it might get a "R" for the scene where she is on the deck with a cigarette. I have never seen a cigarette look so sexual.Or the scene where she is drugged and the Kong surrogate is dancing in front of her. That scene was more passionate than a Jenna Jameson flick.Or the scene where Kong appears and she sees him for the first time. It was as if she was deflowered. the scream was pure ecstasy! The shower scene where Kong blows on her to dry her was supercharged! Sure, this is a Kong film, but with Lange it became a porno film. If this film doesn't excite you, you are dead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The runt of the litter, though still quite watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had first seen the outstanding original of 'King Kong', still transcendent and captivating in its then-prescient use of special effects wizardry, then Sir Peter Jackson's recent remake, which was still extremely impressive. I had only heard horrible things about the 70's version, but I have come to admire Guillermin's films that I had watched, and look at that cast, so when I found the blu used, for a good price, I took a chance. It's definitely the runt of the litter, but is by no means a disaster. It's intriguing that they had originally wanted Joseph Sargent to direct with Peter Falk starring, and that Meryl Streep was considered for the role that eventually went to Jessica Lange. The changes they made to update Kong for the seventies were intriguing (as they wanted the script to be completely different from the Cooper/Schoedsack masterpiece), and I'm left curious, had Sir Peter Jackson chosen to make Kong a 21st-century schizoid apeman instead of doing a period piece, how that would have transpired. Even being Canadian, seeing the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center made me wistfully nostalgic. The only part of the film that was excruciating to watch was when Kong is made to perform for the American Bicentennial festivities, and at the ending, I was curious how Lange got down from the rooftop of one of the towers so fast. The answer probably lies on the cutting room floor, and the editing was probably rushed for release date, so no one must have noticed...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this on Epix. I hadn't seen it in 30 some odd years. Although it had its moments, and for 1976 the effects were pretty darn good, Chuck Grodin's performance is so over the top it is almost unwatchable. Same for Rene Auberjonois (sp) Jeff Bridges is OK, Jessica Lange (thank God) would go on to much better things and acclaim, but here....meh.Some folks have been talking about John Barry's Score. It's OK and fits, but he wrote nearly the same score for several James Bond movies ("For Your Eyes Only" in particular) and there are parts of it that sound almost shockingly similar to his Oscar winning score for "Dances with Wolves".I did still enjoy the story and thought it was quite well thought out and presented.I also thought that it was still better than the 2005 version.I guess the moral of this is you can't always go home, or at least you may find that the streets have changed so much you can't get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, yet slightly entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of King Kong destroys everything the original worked for. It tells the story of a selfish oil baron who travels to Skull Island to find oil, but instead finds natives and a giant gorilla. On the way to the island, they find a young woman stranded at sea who they pick up. The natives offer her to the giant gorilla, and the oil crew heads deeper into the island to get her back, and to capture Kong for monetary gain back in New York. This is a newer, more modern version of the Kong story, yet it still doesn't hold up to the 33 original.The first thing this movie does wrong is changes the plot and characters around so that it doesn't even fit into the King Kong mythos. The second thing it does wrong is puts a man in a monkey suit in the role of Kong. The original movie had primitive claymation effects, but even that is better than a Kong who walks and acts like a man, because it's a man in a suit. Whereas the special effects in the 30s movie were state of the art for the time, they use special effects in this movie that is ages behind what the 70s should be. A guy in a gorilla suit and cartoon explosions does not make a good action movie. This movie doesn't even flow the same as the original. The pacing is really off in some scenes. However, I will say that some scenes involving Kong, particularly the end New York scene, are mildly entertaining and worthy of a "guilty pleasure" viewing.The acting is okay as well. The dialogue is somewhat better in this version, and Jeff Bridges plays a good hero. Jessica Lange is good in her first ever role. Charles Grodin plays a surprisingly rotten character and does very well at it. I kind of enjoyed how Jessica Lange realized toward the end that Kong is just an animal and doesn't deserve to die, as opposed to the original where the female lead is scared of Kong right up to the closing scene.Overall, this isn't a good movie, but the acting is okay and there are a few mildly entertaining scenes.4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kong(76)- a solution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agree- Kong(76) has its problems. Agree- Kong(76) is a "guilty pleasure" for those who saw it on release as one of their first big cinema experiences. Agree- The location cinematography is impressive Agree- Performance of cast is mostly okay. Agree- Kong himself (though a very impressive man in a monkey suit) is almost completely underwhelming. Solution- Someone purchases the film outright and replaces Kong himself, using CGI or whatever. Only Kong is a newly generated image. All the acting performances are left intact (with some editing naturally), but entirely new sequences could be added; old ones enhanced; Kong becomes magical and mythical again, all relatively cheaply, even if only as an experiment for T.V. A very "special edition". Just a thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Benchmark For Cinema, &amp; Dreammakers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong '76 serves as a colossal benchmark in the evolution of cinematic special effects and a damn amazing one at that and I absolutely relished seeing this in theaters several times. Credit must be paid to the jaw dropping craftsmanship that went into creating Kong's huge automatronic arms and fingers which oh so dramatically pluck Jessica Lange from that Skull Mountain sacrificial alter. Rick Baker's masterful prosthetic Gorilla make-up is incredibly emotive, and took make up effects to new heights of brilliance. Of course the 'Environmental Rape By Petrox' and the obvious parallels with kidnapping Kong off his native habitat are still as powerful today, as during the psychedelic 70's. Acknowledgment must also be given to John Barry's haunting, brilliant orchestral score which is second to none. Finally, where would we be without the brilliant cast of characters, including Jeff Bridges, Charles Grodin and a completely unknown Jessica Lange who manages a kick-ass performance and winds up one of America's most respected actors, Lest we not forget the tiny little detail that King Kong '76 also happened to be an enormous (if not critically lambasted) hit at the box office. Time has shown however, that the critical reaction was more in part to Dino DeLaurentiis's sheer audacious tenacity than the quality of the film itself. (That and the fact that he called Meryl Streep a pig in Italian, at her audition for the film. Not smart Dino.) In short, King Kong '76 has influenced myself and millions of other aspiring artists, actors, filmmakers and technicians more than I can say. Words seem inadequate. Between it and the never-to-be-topped 1933 original, these two are hands down the best of the bunch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of oil workers stumble upon a giant ape and return him to New York with expected catastrophic results.The original King Kong is a classic for a very good reason. Even with the advances in special effects, the entire production still holds up very well to this day. It is a film with a lot of imagination and suspense and delves into our fear of the unknown on Skull Island. However, the advances in special effects are a good reason why it is a candidate for remake status. The problem here is that producer Dino De Laurentiis (affectionately known in the industry as Dino De Horrendous) and director John Guillermin and company do not seem to understand the themes that made the first film a classic.For anyone who wants to pick at Peter Jackson's 2005 remake, there is no question that Jackson gets what made the original film an enduring thrill ride and largely re-recaptured that spirit. The original features many memorable suspense scenes in the murky depths of Skull Island with a variety of prehistoric and primordial creatures taking center stage. This woebegone remake features pretty much nothing but an obviously phony man in a monkey suit making goo-goo eyes at a pouty blond (Jessica Lange before she could act). I remember seeing this film as a kid - filmgoers had a lot of expectations going in and were looking forward to the event. Not only did this not connect with me, but I remember vividly the wild raucous laughter and jeers which greeted the film. The critics savaged the film deservedly and it became a huge box office bomb. To my surprise, there has developed a certain faction that actually hold the film in some regard. Having watched it twice more since my initial exposure, I am supremely puzzled as to why that could be since the film gets progressively worse with each successive viewing.The special effects are pretty dreadful and do not improve on the original, which is saying something since there is a 40+ year difference in their production dates. Having robbed Skull Island of its other prehistoric denizens, then one would hope that the screenplay would need to be much stronger in order to pick up the slack for the lack of excitement. Instead, this sports one of the more laughable stories. The search for oil on Skull Island is never very convincing nor are the men searching for it - and the way that Lange's character gets conveniently shoe-horned into the plot is absurd. The dialog is especially groanworthy.While one can credit having Lange's heroine not scream incessantly throughout the film a la Fay Wray,she also fails to elicit our sympathy like the aforementioned iconic Wray and fails to equal the luminous intensity of Naomi Watts in the 2005 remake. Lange was a model just starting out at this point and, although she became a very good actress, she was not at this time seasoned enough to triumph over such an impossible screenplay. The scenes where the ape gives Lange lascivious looks are comical although filmed with the utmost solemnity. Ditto, the sequences at the end where Lange and leading man Jeff Bridges run through the streets of NYC after Kong's escape and she keeps insisting they should stop at a bar to get a drink are downright surreal - is the character a lush or something? The less said about long-haired Jeff Bridges and the far-out-of-his-element Charles Grodin, the better. The producers exchange the Empire State Building for the World Trade Center, but the final moments fail to make the impact or the impression of either the original or the 2005 remake.The end result is a completely lamentable dud sporting incompetence on every level. There is zero to recommend this film and anyone who remembers it fondly is either deranged or indulging in a shameful misguided sense of sentimentality that this film never earned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong (1976) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Big budget remake of the 1933 film certainly isn't as good as the original but it is miles better than the 2005 film from Peter Jackson. This time out Charles Grodin plays a man who travels to a mysterious island trying to locate oil for his company. Jeff Bridges plays a scientist and Jessica Lange is on board as a woman saves after her boat went down in a storm. All three are impressive by the island until the giant ape shows up and becomes fixated on the blonde. This film seems to take a lot of heat, which is somewhat understandable but I'd have to give the film an A for effort even though the final movie doesn't turn out as well as one would have hoped. What does work best here are the special effects of Kong, which are truly outstanding. There isn't a single frame in the film where Kong appears to be a fake and this adds a lot of truth to his character, which they actually do try to develop here. Whether he's breaking down trees in the jungle or climbing to the top of the World Trade Center, all these effects come off looking terrific and they certainly hold up well today. Another added bonus is Jessica Lange who turns in a good performance even though her character is horribly written. She's mainly on display here for us to look at her body but I'm not going to complain about this. Both the Grodin and Bridges' characters are also poorly written but both actors manage to do good work, although they both go over the top at times. The screenplay is the film's biggest problem due to how long things get carried out. I think cutting ten or fifteen minutes would have really helped the film because several scenes get carried out too long. The search for Kong goes on forever as does the final escape. I do respect the fact that the filmmakers tried to do a different take on the story instead of simply remaking the original movie. I think the one major plus over the original film is Kong himself who is a lot more likable. I always found it hard to care for Kong in the original but by the end of this film I did care about him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really terrible, though the effects *do* stink</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, as a whole, isn't awful. Well OK, it's bad, but not unwatchably so. The effects are poor, though, notably the guy in the ape suit. At first I thought I was just spoiled by Peter Jackson's awesome CGI gorilla, but this '76 version doesn't even stand up to the original's ape (which is still effective to this day; heck, it doesn't even stand up to the fake gorilla in Trading Places). Which brings to mind the question of why this film couldn't have gotten the same stop-motion treatment as the original. It's likely the producers thought a guy in an ape suit (constantly gesticulating and "roaring") would be more convincing. One wonders, though, why Ray Harryhausen (who began his career in stop-motion as a result of the '33 film) couldn't be consulted; I guess he was busy with Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger at the time, but this film could have sorely used his talents.On another note, switching the Empire State Building with the World Trade Center simply doesn't work. The effect is not the same as that of a giant ape ascending a giant steepled tower. In fact, the whole thing comes across as lame. There is also the discomforting image of a helicopter hitting one of the towers, but the filmmakers can hardly be criticized for that.</fullReview>

As Kong's bride Dwan, Jessica Lange looks pretty hot in that outfit, and as hero Jack Prescott, Jeff Bridges looks like the ultimate hippie; as unctuous Fred Wilson, Charles Grodin makes a really nasty character. Clearly this version was very much a product of the '70s, but that's no crime. It's sort of strange to see the big guy scaling the World Trade Center, knowing what happened to it on 9/11.

		<fullReview>*(half)outta *****Dino DeLaurentis' remake proves that you shouldn't monkey around with classics, especialy the 1933 King Kong.Warning: SpoilersThe movie maker, Carl Denham in the original has been replaced by FredWilson, a greedy oil explorer. Jack Driscol replaced by Jack Prescott, and Ann Darrow replaced by Dwan. Wilson and his crew try to find oil on a remote island, with stow-away Jack Prescott. They find Dwan floating on a lifeboat and take her on the boat. Soon, they get to the island, and find that the island is the home of some natives. When they are back on the boat, the natives kidnap Dwan and introduce her to none other than King Kong. He takes her away and falls in love with her. The crew rescues Dwan, and captures Kong as a display. Of course Kong escapes and causes a rampage through New York. He kidnaps Dwan, climbs the World Trade Center,, and falls to his death.Dino DeLaurentis lied to us about that robot Kong they were building. All we get is an ape suit(a very good ape suit, though). Not very faithful to the original either. Dwan actually is trying to protect Kong, and weeps his death. And "Beauty killed the Beast" wasn't mentioned. This time, it was the airplanes that killed Kong.</fullReview>

The skull island set looks like someone spread a few rocks and trees around a completely barren hellhole. Jessica Lange was terrible as Dwan ( a really stupid name rather than a misspelling ) i mean, why the hell would you ask a thirty met-re high ape what star sign it is? And then the ape feels her up and by the end shes begging for it to be saved? Whats the go with that? I supposed it was the scriptwriters fault rather than Langes, the whole script is rubbish, rubbish rubbish. Its badly directed, badly acted and Kong looked far more realistic in the original. I don't understand why Dino De Laurentiis wanted to make this, it has dragged his name, Jessica Langes name and John Guillermans name through the mud for almost thirty year now - in fact, Lange managed to get up again and win two Oscars, so i suppose i shouldn't count her in this. But then they did the worst thing of all: King Kong Lives, a film that was, if possible even more of a disgrace to the name of Kong. This films only saving grace is the final scene which i grudgingly admit was well done, but wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a travesty...a putrid reinterpretation of one of the great movie classics. I saw King Kong(1933)for the first time on TV in the 1950's, and it is, without a doubt, the movie that made me love movies. I can think of few movies, like Kong '76, that I was more disappointed with. Though my tastes have changed...action/scifi/fantasy are no longer my cup of tea...I can think of no other movie I have seen as much and enjoyed more than I enjoy Kong (33). It remains one of the most mesmerizing, exciting, and thrilling movies I have ever seen. It's grand special effects, which, by the way, remain effective to this day, it's weird and wonderful score, and it terrific pacing has maybe been equaled but never top. I would only hope that Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange, two actors that I greatly admire, find this the embarrassment of their careers. It is little more than man-in-a-monkey-suit nonsense. (And Lange made the cover of Time (perhaps Newsweek) in the hand of Kong? Go figure.) I guess taste is a matter of choice, but anyone who thinks this is a good movie worth noting has taste...only in his mouth.</fullReview>

The wonderful music to the beautiful cinematography in Kuwai.From the great performances to the sheer spectacle of the whole thing.This, I feel, is a film that will be re-evaluated one day.It was NOT a financial flop when it was released and the reviews of the time were mostly positive.Yes, I also love the original. From a technical standpoint the 1933 Kong can't be faulted. And I love the fact that the first Kong was a force of nature who knew how to box.But this kinder, gentler Kong, whose eyes you could see and who's soul you could see, just edges it for me, along with all of the other points in the rewatchability stakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kong is still King.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1970s style re-imagining of the legendary cinema beauty-and-the-beast story stars Jeff Bridges as Jack Prescott, a hippie-ish paleontology professor who hitches a ride with an oil company's vessel. Their fearless leader, Fred Wilson (a shamelessly hammy Charles Grodin), is convinced that somewhere in the ocean near Surabaya is an island that's just rich with potential. Of course, we all know the story: what the adventurers find instead is an enormous ape, revered by the people of the island. Wilson attempts to salvage something out of the trip by transporting Kong back to NYC and putting him on display, but we know nothing good can come of this.This Dino De Laurentiis production is really not that terrible as its reputation would suggest. It just suffers some from a bit of overlength, an inadvisable campy approach, and its silly, silly characters &amp; dialogue. The special effects (overseen by Carlo Rambaldi, later to create E.T.) are variable - sometimes they work well, sometimes not so well. The treat is watching makeup effects legend Rick Baker don a gorilla costume for some scenes. Although this remake is done in colour and widescreen, it just doesn't quite have the atmosphere of the 1933 film. It might have been nice to see a few more wonders on the island; as it is, we only get to see Kong do battle with a giant snake. The fact that in this instance Kong climbs not The Empire State Building but The Twin Towers may affect how some people respond to the film in this day and age. One obvious asset is the majestic music score by John Barry.Bridges is likable, but there are times when his character might infuriate some people. Grodin performs as if the filmmakers told him to "act more like Robert Armstrong" (Carl Denham in the 1933 production), and the character is so obnoxious and sleazy that you can't help but cheer when he inevitably gets his. Many viewers thought that Jessica Langes' debut film performance was highly inauspicious, but her appeal and beauty are undeniable. There's a very strong supporting cast: John Randolph, Rene Auberjonois, Julius Harris, Jack O'Halloran, Dennis Fimple, and Ed Lauter. It's nice to see 50s sci-fi star John Agar in a cameo as a lying weasel of a city official; John Lone, Corbin Bernsen, and Joe Piscopo have bits.In the end, the love that Kong lavishes upon Dwan (Lange) is still pretty poignant, and you can't help but feel very bad for Kong.Followed by a sequel (!) 10 years later, incredibly enough."King Kong" '76 misses its potential for true greatness, but it's still pretty decent entertainment.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have been better if it had been about another large animal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film was first released, I went to see it with my boyfriend of the time, and three things kept running through my mind as I viewed it: 1) The nighttime outdoor sets look like they were all filmed indoors and the lighting makes it look that way 2) this would have been a very decent "message" film about environmental and native- culture destruction if some other large animal (ANY other animal, but PLEASE, not the legendary King Kong) had been the focus and 3) the gorilla walks bipedally, thus making him look like what he is... a man in a suit. I had envisioned an alternate script about, say, people coming to a neighboring island near Skull Island (that one having sunk in SON OF KONG), capturing a Stegosaurus, and taking him back to New York in chains and using him to sell Petrox products, and later, his escape and death. The guilt could be placed where it belonged... on the heads of everyone who participated in any way. Then, we would be left with a fine piece of cinema, a sort of companion piece, if you will, to the King Kong type of films. Since it wouldn't have used a cheesy version of King Kong, the critics and general public would not have trashed it in their reviews.  Unfortunately, I came away feeling like someone else had exploited King Kong yet again... this time, the producer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the King Kong movie from my year of birth. It gave me nightmares as a young child, but I've always loved the movie.I disliked the 1986 sequel 'King Kong Lives' but this one -to me- is still very likable. I love the humor and the acting is at its best.Yes, the effects are outdated and not convincing anymore, but at least it were live action effects and back then way more convincing than the CGI of today. Yes, Kong is the guy in a suit, but there was no Andy Serkis around back then or other actors who were capable of studying gorilla's and their movements (concidering the idea that Kong has to be a giant gorilla, instead of another unspecified unique primate), but later films had even worse convincing apes ('Trading places', 'Greystoke, the legend of Tarzan', 'Gorillas in the Mist', etc.).I just finished watching it today since like 30 years and I was surprised how good the acting was. I've never seen the 1933 movie, but I did see Peter Jackson's version. I prefer this one over Peter Jackson's version, because Jackson's version is too long in running time and boring from the moment with the giant insects on.Kong is the metaphor, the Carl Jung kind of archetype, that represents the dark and fierce side of nature that fascinates us. The story is a mirror to us, the other primates, showing us how stupid we are when we think we can dominate nature and bend it to our will, and destroying it when we discover we can't, because we are too proud to confess how stupid we were in the first place instead of admitting that we should have let nature alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if Jessica Lange looks back at her film debut in the 1976 King Kong with embarrassment. She may well do so, because it is indeed embarrassing (although, to be fair, much of the embarrassment derives from how the character was written rather than how it was performed. However, the character of Dwan isn't half as embarrassing as the way Kong is realised.A man in a monkey suit is substantially cheaper than animation. However, a man in a monkey suit is also unmistakably a man in a monkey suit. This is due to the fact that ape proportions are different to human proportions - in a nutshell, apes' arms are longer. Of course, you can add arm extensions, which helps - they didn't do that here, so you have a man in a monkey suit.Geoff Bridges is OK. Charles Grodin isn't funny. Rick Baker's hydraulically operated ape face is excellent.This falls short of being a worthy failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was 1976, and the movie makers thought they were too sophisticated to make King Kong the proud monarch of a mysterious island that encounters the brutality of human "civilization" with tragic results that we all knew from the 1933 classic. No, they decided to demote the once-formidable ape King to a court jester.For that matter, Ann (now named "Dwan" for absolutely no reason), Jack Driscoll (also with an unnecessary new name), and all the rest are portrayed as unevolved primates too. Gone is Kong's fearsomeness from the primitive black/white stop motion giant we once marvelled at; now we have an obvious rubber suit actor. Worse yet, Kong's hand is a clunky contraption that would make the audio-amnotron robots at Disney World cringe in embarrassment. It's such a pile of junk there are scenes where Lange actually has to jump into the thing to try to make it look like it's moving. Kong in color presents problems which the animators fail to address, but his paper mache cut-out appearance is the thing that really makes him look phony. His eyes roll left to right and back again in a bizarre manner that make the poor guy look like he just escaped a psycho ward, not Skull Island.The acting was so bad it could have been career ending for many actors. Just the same, Jessica Lange should hide in shame when viewers see her talking to Kong with a disco '76 sensibility (or lack of sensibility) and making trite jokes that should have inspired the great ape to squish her to shut her up. Unfortunately, this movie makes Kong a clod too, and he just reacts to Ann's poor acting with a few disco convulsions while those defective eyes of his spin around. As for Jeff Bridges: no comment.Updating the world's technology to the '70's served no purpose other than to remind you that this was a cheap remake, as if the flick's many other problems weren't enough to expose that fact. The movie's effort to marry an eco-friendly message about the animal kingdom with numerous lame attempts at topical humor just doesn't work. The script tries many ways to get you involved, and fails at all of them.In respect of the 1933 movie, I'll be generous and give this pretender a 4. At least it's entertaining in the sense you can laugh at how inept it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The jacket cover is misleading ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... because the picture of King Kong atop the World Trade Center indicates broad daylight. If you watch the movie, you will probably end up with eye strain as just about the entire film is shot in near total darkness.THE MOVIE IS TOO DARK!It's almost as though the cameraman had just found a sale on filters., and was testing them all out on the same project. Why bother to make a movie that is so difficult to see? Was it an effort to hide poor special effects? I suspect that is the case in many features that are shot using an abundance of filters.Otherwise, KING KONG (1976) might have been good, if one could have seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst remakes, if not worst films, of all time. Everything about this film is utterly repulsive and 70's except for some decent cinematography. The other two King Kong films are filled with action, danger, and adventure. What do we have here? Rick Baker in an ape suit carrying a shrieking Jessica Lange around for over an hour and a half until they get to New York City...where Rick Baker in an ape suit carries a shrieking Jessica Lange around the World Trade Center. The characters were all stupid and unlikeable: The shrieking Jessica Lange, the holier-than-thou environmentalist Jeff Bridges, and the oily oil man Charles Grodin..actually turns out to be more likable than our heroes. All I can say is this: At 134 minutes, this is a great movie to fall asleep to. Don't worry, you probably won't miss anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>King Kong Adventure/Giant Monster Horror Here we have the classic story of the money-hungry oil company setting course over the ocean to find desolate Skull Island to drill for oil. What's that you say? That doesn't sound like the classic you know? Well too bad for you, because 1976 Hollywood doesn't give a sh*t what you have to say! They're coked up and ready to give a true classic a modern raping!Well, basically, it's the classic King Kong story, except instead of a film crew, it's, like I said, an oil company. Way to pander to the oil crisis of the 70's, Hollywood. Jessica Lange now plays the part that made Fay Wray famous, with less brains but more sexiness. Sure, she looks pretty hot, but is as shallow as a kiddie pool. Charles Grodin is the evil mastermind of the oil expedition who then changes cue to go catch a Kong and bring him back as?-here we go?-king sh*t of corporate mascots. The worst creature they came up with for this island for Kong to fight against is a lame giant snake?-with lots of teeth. They could've at least had Kong fighting the Sinclair dinosaur?Here's the breakdown:The Good:--Occasionally, the special effects aren't too bad. But generally, they're not overly interesting.--Decent acting from everyone except Lange.--Decent use of incorporating the whole oil theme into the story, but Christ, dealing oil tycoons in King Kong? This feels pretty stupid.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The effects work on Kong is decent, but not perfect by any means.--Jessica Lange is hot.--Kong is now equal to Godzilla in that it's a dude stomping around a miniature city in a costume. Sometimes it looks just like that, sometimes it looks better than that.--Kong is good and violent.--Average Cinematography and Atmosphere.--Kong climbs the recently completed (at the time) World Trade Center buildings instead of the Empire State Building. You remember those? Some jerks tried to land passenger jets on them and failed miserably.The Bad:--Extremely shallow compared to Kong '33 and Kong '05.--NO dinosaurs!--Very little heart. Lange's character (still managing to play an actress) is dimwitted and she doesn't feel for Kong very well. Kong's emotional display is also pretty iffy. He's one stiff monkey.--Kong spends all his time, just like real gorillas, walking upright. Oh wait a second? That's how people walk! Apes go on all fours! Silly me.--Kong doesn't sound very much like an ape.--Pretty awful sets and backgrounds. Very dull?especially the "lush tropical, primitive island." --There's a part where Kong hold Lange under a waterfall to wash her, then proceeds to blow on her to dry her off. And holy crap, does he ever look ridiculous. Has anyone ever seen an ape puff it's cheeks and blow on anything? I know I haven't. I've seen 'em bear their gums and teeth and lick their own snotty nostrils, but never blow air.The Ugly:--This is the likely source of the term "bastardization." Memorable Scene:--I guess when Kong breaks loose in New York. Either that or when he pretty much removes Jessica Lange's top while molesting her. Or, I mean, "touching her to learn about her."Acting: 7/10 Story: 3/10 (total raping of a classic) Atmosphere: 5/10 Cinematography: 5/10 Character Development: 5/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 6/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 3/10 (There's no nudity, but sex is a primary theme of this one) Violence/Gore: 6/10 (no gore) Dialogue: 5/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 6/10 Cheesiness: 3/10 Crappiness: 2/10Overall: 5/10There you have it. This is one inferior remake. It's interesting and it has a few high points, but it does pretty much everything either worse or wrong than the true blue original King Kong from 1933. And it's exceptionally shallow. It's a guilty pleasure or curiosity at best. Generally not recommended. Film buffs and Kong/horror enthusiasts can probably take a gander. A fine example of how to do a remake all wrong.www.ResidentHazard.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"King Kong" and "Star Trek: The Motion Picture"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1976 version of "King Kong" and the very first (I think it was 1979) big-screen adaptation of "Star Trek" are two of the very first movies I can recall seeing in a movie theater. I think I was about eight when I saw "King Kong" and about ten when I saw "Star Trek: The Motion Picture." And I vividly remember sitting in the theater silently for several minutes after both films ended with my jaw open - unable to put into words the immensity of my disappointment. I couldn't even summon the strength to get up and leave until my mom prodded me several times.Although I knew I felt let down by both the "King Kong" remake and the first "Star Trek" movie, it wasn't until some years later that I realized just how similar my disappointment was in both cases.The 1933 release of "King Kong" and the 1960s "Star Trek" TV series were two of my all-time-favorite childhood entertainment staples. I loved both despite their flaws, and maybe even because of them. They had become like an old friends whom you learn to love all the more for all of their goofy quirks and frailties. The over-dramatic acting, cheesy special effects, and thunderously melodramatic music of both the original "King Kong" and the original "Star Trek" just made them all the more endearing. Like a good friend, they weren't perfect, but their hearts were always in the right place, and you never got tired of visiting them over and over again.So, when updated big-screen adaptations of "King Kong" and "Star Trek" came out, I of course assumed that I would love the new versions for the same reasons that I loved their predecessors, and that the only difference would be that the new offerings would be even better.And, boy, was I blown away. And not in a good way.In place of the lovable - if overly earnest - characters of the originals were either hollow, soulless shadows of their former selves (as in "Star Trek"); or stupid, annoying, completely unlikable jerks (as in "King Kong).Instead of the fast-paced and engagingly simple story lines of the originals, we got slow, uninteresting, and hopelessly convoluted story lines that no one could possibly care about - even if they could actually follow what was happening.And worst of all, I realized with rising dread as I sat through both movies that I just didn't like what these old friends had become. And not just in the sense that I didn't want to spend time with them anymore; I literally didn't like THEM. They used to be honest and forthright; now they were dodgy and self-delusional. There was a time when they never took themselves too seriously, and never passed on an opportunity to laugh at themselves; now they were self-important, arrogant, and took themselves deadly seriously. And where you once felt they were happiest when they made you happy; they now had become the center of their own universe, and seemed to believe that it was your job to revolve around them - no matter how boring and uninteresting they had become.Well, I gave my old friend "Star Trek" another chance, and apparently it was just an adolescent phase she was going through. She was back to her old self by the time "The Wrath of Khan" came out. Now she's getting up there in years, but she's still the same friend from my childhood. I don't always like spending time with her, but I always like her.After 29 years, I'm anxious to give another one of my childhood friends another chance. Thanks, Peter Jackson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the original was far superior to this 1976 version! And the original was in black-and-white too! But you gotta hand it to these guys (the filmmakers led by Dino De Laurentiis) responsible for resurrecting the "King" and once-again letting him loose on N.Y. civilization.There are some interesting special-effect moments, especially the water-fall sequence in which the big lug assists his bathing beauty.Actress Jessica Lange (ex-model) cut her teeth by starring in this one, and it hasn't damaged her career one bit. Unfortunately, the other actors aren't as interesting to watch, and there combined sum 'outweigh' the star gorilla itself.Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) is working on yet another remake, but, in these post 9-11 times, we'll probably see Kong return to the Empire State Building.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the 1976 re-make, what a painful adaptation and probably the worst. Even though Jeff Bridges was in it, and even a nipple slip of all things on the part of Jessica Lange, this film was a bore. I'm a die-hard fan of monster movies, and have the utmost respect for the gods of the genre like the original 1954 "Gojira", the original "King Kong", and "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms". And I've sat threw rummage like "Gamera vs. Viras" and "Godzilla vs. Megalon". but at least even the really grimy parts of monster history didn't fail in at least delivering some action. This film, good lord, I could barely sit through. There's a whole lot of pointless exposition, and when we finally get to Skull Island we see so little of it was such a disappointment. So much of the original story was raped and done away with what was meant to replace is crap.the first film and the 2005 re-make use Skull Island to instill a sense of mystery and terror to our audience, and the feeling is reversed when Kong is in our own concrete jungle. But all Kong did on Skull Island was fight a giant python marionette, and I'm all for marionettes, in fact I love Toho for their practical effects as opposed to CGI...but..nothing else happens!! then Kong gets captured, whup tee do. Where was the Tyrannosaurus, the Pterosaurs, the Stegosaurus, the f*ckin dinosaurs??!! And Ms. Lange was so uninvolved, I just didn't care about their romantic scenes of her with Kong.And the score failed to really do anything for me. Many of Akira Ifukube's works have far grander compositions for films widely regarded as mediocre compared to American entertainment. This my fellow reviewers, is evidence of just an epic fail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There IS only One King Kong - it was made in 1933</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to make this review short. I despise this picture. The only good memory I have of this turkey about a gorilla is that I have friends who were struggling comedians who made it as extras in the crowd scene at the end. I had almost no money when I lived in New York when this one came out and I used my rare three dollars to come in out of the cold LITERALLY ans I could sleep on the sleazy 42nd Street Theater.Besides the truly rotten performance by Charles Brodin as Carl Denham, and waste of both Jeff Bridges and Jessic Lange who all but apologized for this film that all but destroyed her career.(Fortunately, it did not) the damn poster is terrible. Think about this for a moment. Here is Kong almost taller than the twin towers he stands astride holding a jet plane which is as large as the woman he carries in his other hand. This would make Jessic Lange about the size of the 50 foot woman from another awful movie. And there was no jet plane, if you remember this picture at all.One more closing note. For the record, when people talk about gorillas or orangutangs as "monkeys," tell them to get smart. Monkeys have tails. Apes do not. Kong, all the chimps you've seen in movies and TV shows, and the orangutangs in those Clint Eastwood pics are Apes. You don't believe me, when they turn around, notice their shaved almost obscene butts.And that's a wrap, folkies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's It?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes of classics start out in trouble because they have a lot to live up to. This remake succeeded in failing to do just that, improve on the original. The special effects aren't much better than a high school production, and the acting and directing are better left without comment. All the great scenes from the original, i.e, the Kong battles with other creatures (save for one terribly fake snake fight), the battle in the native village, and much of the New York mayhem was eliminated and often replaced with a guy walking around in a monkey suit doing lots of wild arm gestures. The relationship between Kong and the girl is well established many, many times. In the original, Kong's affection for her is exhibited by his willingness to often fight to the death for her. This version uses lots of eye contact and tender moments as if Kong had read "Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus". The final fight on top of the World Trade Center is nicely done, and I do think Kong's plunge to his death and final moments are a little better than the original. (The heart-beat sequence is quite unique.) Overall, I feel that a movie, with nearly 40 years of technology development between it and the original, should outdo the original in at least some areas. This one does not. After watching it, one is provoked into asking the question, "That's It?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i always heard mixed opinions about this movie and now that I've seen it they should all be negative opinions. this movie in the first half hour seems like it might be decent, but from then on it goes down the toilet. i will give the filmmakers credit, they did try taking a different a different approach with the story so it didn't copy the original exactly but it ends up being a mediocre and uninspired story that if you took the king Kong part out of the movie then this film would just blend in with the crowd. the acting in the film isn't terrible, but nothing special and the characters themselves you don't really care for and you actually may hate some of them that were like able in the original film. as for the special effects, well they ain't so special. for the most part the special effects actually look pretty bad and for this time they could've been way better which is another reason this film doesn't need to be remembered. but lets not forget the big boy king Kong. in this film he basically is as expected the only character you care for. just to bad they went for a Japanese monster style and made him a guy in a rubber suit WHAT WERE THEY THINKING,this is king Kong not Godzilla you don't make him a guy in a rubber suit. overall they tried to modernize the story and it just doesn't work. this movie just shouldn't have been made and I'm sure the original king Kong hides in embarrassment from this god awful film, then of course they made a sequel to a bad film, that is all that needs to be said. my final words STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE AND IF YOU FIND IT ON DVD SMASH IT, MAKE THE REAL KING KONG PROUD!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes entertaining but too damn tedious to full enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: ** out of ****.I thought I would redo my comments on this film since I recently watched it on TV recently. First of all, I can honestly admit that I have never been a fan of this film, even when I saw it when I was younger I never really cared for it. The problem is that this film is just too long and really just too stupid to really enjoy. That is not to say there isn't anything worth praising here but the negative significantly outweigh the positive.First of all, I'll start with the film's good points. I like how they made Jessica Lange's character actually care about Kong instead of being disgusted by him. Honestly, I have never seen the original film (yet at least) but I heard the situation was just the opposite, Fay Wray's character hated Kong. So I will at least say that at the end when Kong dies, I did at least feel some sadness for him. Its interesting to note that in Peter Jackson's film he used this approach for the relationship between the Ape and the women, instead of the one in the original film. It's developed much more in Jackson's film than here but its always been one of the most interesting aspects of this film.Then there's Kong himself. In this film, he's brought to life by make-up artist Rick Baker in a monkey suit. For the most part, I think it works pretty well. He doesn't look 100 percent convincing, since you can tell that those are not the eyes of a giant ape. Plus, there are times when Kong looks at Dwan (Jessica Langes character) and you can't help but feel thats the facial expression of a horny teenager instead of a big ape. However, I think Kong still holds up reasonably well.What doesn't look convincing in the slightest is that big snake that Kong fights. How, even in 1976, would that look convincing? It looks so fake its funny and Kong actually struggles to beat it. Seriously, it is one of the most embarrassing effects I have ever seen in a film.The acting does not really help matters either. The best of the bunch is Jeff Bridges, who actually does quite well here. The rest of the cast doesn't fair so well. Charles Grodin is embarrassingly over the top and its safe to say Jessica Lange had a less than stellar debut.To be fair, there are moments near the end of the film when she is good,when she tells Kong not to put her down or he'll be killed.The script does not help either. It contains some of the most ridiculous lines I have ever heard in a film like when Dwan asks Kong, "Im a Libra, what sign are you." Then there's when she calls Kong a "Goddamn chauvinist pig ape." I guess you can't entirely blame Jessica Lange for the awfulness of her performances when she is given the worst lines of all the actors. What made the relationship in the new film special is that there were very few said at all, it was mostly all non-verbal. You could see the feelings in the facial expressions of the ape and the women.That said, this film still has some impressive cinematography. The scene with the fog around the island lends an eerie atmosphere. Plus, the score by John Barry is top notch. Finally, Kongs first appearance is nicely handled. But when it comes down to it, the film is just too damn dumb to take for 134 minutes. There are some good things about this King Kong but Jackson's remake makes this one look insignificant by comparison. So the film can be occasionally fun to watch but it ends up being too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, this was bad. So bad! After seeing it in the theater, I was truly amazed at what a disaster it was. Dino de Laurentiis does know how to promote a movie! The posters were great, for instance.But, the movie is a mess! The main problem? The inexplicable use of effects legend Rick Baker in an ape costume. Why, oh why! Yeah, I know this was before CGI and everything. But, there have always been good stop-motion animators, including the very legendary Ray Harryhausen. Was he not available or something? So, they have Baker in a costume. The costume is good (by Rick Baker himself, of course!). But, they shoot it in standard frame rate (24 frames = 1 second, shot and projected). This is instead of shooting it in slow motion, at least a little slow motion. Just to give Kong some feeling of his being 40 feet tall. But, they don't, and so almost the whole Kong footage comes across as giving us Rick Baker in an ape suit!The rest of the "effects," such as they are, lack a lot too. The giant snake comes across as incredibly cheap and fake.The rest of it is mediocre at best! The acting is okay, but Charles Grodin in particular is awfully hammy. Sheesh! Richard Kline's cinematography is good, while John Barry's film score is kind of sleepy.And, lastly, there is zero reason for this remake! That includes Peter Jackson's ill-advised remake, that was okay, but again very unnecessary. I know that people want to "update" the effects, but the effects do not need to be updated! They were perfectly fine the first time. So was everything else.Do I need to say that you should skip this one?** (2 Out of 10 Stars)</fullReview>

I suffered through the movie. if you have seen other king Kong movies stick with them they are better than this one. The effects in this movie were really lame. They were about as bad as the old TV show "land of the lost". One main problem was there was to much romance in it. There was not as much in "King Kong" 1933 or in "King Kong" 2005.

For most of the movie it was just a man in an ape suit. It was advertised at the time that they built a giant robotic ape that looked so real you wouldn't believe your eyes. Well it was so bad that they only used it for less than 3 minutes of movie time. When those scenes appear you can see how phony it looks and it doesn't even match the man in the ape suit. Check out the scene when he's back in New York and he's escaping from his chains. watch closely to see what I'm talking about. This movie was also too long. I can't understand how a movie made in 1933 can have better special effects than one made over 40 years later.</fullReview>

The special effects range from decent-(Kong's rampage in New York) to downright ludicrous (blowdrying Jessica Lange after pulling her out of the water.)In the original KONG it was clear that the staff put their whole heart and soul into it and produced a classic. Not so here. It looked like DeLaurentis &amp; Co. were just out to make a quick buck-just like Devlin &amp; Emmerich with their disasterous GODZILLA remake 22 years later.One piece of possible good news though. Rumor has it that a remake of the classic KONG-one that is faithful to the original-is in the works.If those involved in this project happen to read this review-PLEASE!!!!!GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME!Rating: *1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

But the rating is so low because it went away from the original.First of all, it takes place with oil tycoons and not filmmakers which they were in the classic.Second of all, the name of the blonde (Jessica Lange) is wrong, in the original it was Ann Darrow and in this one it was Duon.Third, when Duon awoke she asked where Harry (THe man who she said was gonna put her in a movie) was, in the original it was Carl Dunham who asked Ann Darrow to be in a movie.If your a fan of Kong, watch it for the violence and not to see a good remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake has been pretty much forgotten about in recent years, and that's just as well because it's terrible. The original film came out forty three years before this one, and you would think, therefore, that this version would have greatly improved on the special effects. That's not the case at all; the original version may not look great in today's CGI age; but it's a hell of a lot better than this one. The ape in the original at least looked real if you stretched your imagination; but no matter how much you stretch it here, Kong is just a man in a suit; and it really does bring the whole thing down. I find it impossible to take an 'ape' walking upright seriously...it's like they just couldn't be bothered! The story has changed for this film, too, and instead of being a film crew travelling to Skull Island to make a picture, we follow an oil expedition that go there in order to find some oil. The island turns out to be more than they bargained for, however, when they meet up with the giant ape; King Kong! ?They also find a girl on a lifeboat in an obvious attempt to explain why there would be a woman around for Kong to obsess over...The plot details aren't the only thing that's been changed here - there are no Dinosaurs either! We get to see Kong wrestling a rubber snake (in a totally ridiculous scene), and that's all the monster fighting there is. Skull Island has gone from a lush, tropical jungle bursting with life - to a horrible, baron wasteland desolate of everything (including a giant ape that doesn't look like a man in a suit). In fact, I can't think of anything about this film that wasn't done a million times better in the original. The cast is this film's biggest asset - with Jeff Bridges taking the lead role. He looks every bit the rugged hero and if it wasn't for him, I'd have REALLY hated this film. Jessica Lange gets to be Fay Wray; and, at times, comes close to evoking an emotional impact from the audience. The original cast was far, far better though. Even the famous Empire States Building ending has been forsaken in favour of having the man in a suit atop the World Trade Centre. Why? ...I have no idea. Overall, I really can't recommend seeing this film. Forget it was made - see the original, see Peter Jackson's version...but please; avoid this rubbish like the plague. Would you believe...it actually gets WORSE when Kong appears?!</fullReview>

Aside from the mediocre monkey suit and full size animatronic 'robot Kong' that gets mere seconds of screen time and more closely resembles a 50 foot tall shag carpet, I think the attempt to make it 'hip and modern' is what truly killed this picture.It's one and ONLY redeeming value is that you can tell Kong's designer Rick Baker was working his hardest against a completely inept producer and director. The facial features on his Kong are remarkably expressive, though the 'Bigfoot' design of the body (allegedly at the insistence of DeLaurentis) doesn't work well at all.I could see hints of acting talent in Jessica Lange that would shine through in later films, as she worked her way through the insipid script. There is really and truly a talented cast in there, but they had nothing to work with.I'd only recommend this picture to those who can't imagine how truly horrible a remake of a classic can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disaster ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of the original movie (1933) and unfortunately it's a disaster ... The costume of Kong is shapely made for the time but you can't like Kong like you can appreciate him in the movie by Peter Jackson : he's looks like a villain and his perverse smiles to Duane are really frightening ! Moreover, the men who captured him, will say to Duane that the gorilla has tried to ... rape her ! This is really fishy ... For the end we wait to see Kong on the Empire State Building like in the original movie but it's another famous building of New York which is the place of the end. This movie is really bad : the heroin is stupid to the point to fall in the cage where Kong is locked, the hero has a big ugly beard and the dinosaurs are completely absent of the Skull Island (to replace them, we got a huge rubber snake). To finish I'll say that this movie shouldn't have to be produced because others films have followed and they are sadder.(Sorry for the faults I'm french)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Behold! The not-so-mighty Pauper Kong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of King Kong (1933) since I was a kid and a fan of King Kong (2005) since it came out, I've long been curious to see the 1976 version. Although pictures of Kong from this movie looked awful and I suspected it would be the worst of the King Kongs, as a Kong fan it seemed right that I'd at least see it. I now have, and I was more or less right about it.Unlike the other two versions, this one is set in the '70s, and instead of a film crew, the expedition to Skull Island is looking for oil. They stupidly invest a lot into the oil that it turns out is unusable. Along the way, they pick up a stowaway primatologist (rather convenient) and a shipwrecked bimbo Dwan (Jessica Lange). So this movie robs us many of the characters (and all of the dinosaurs) we know and loved. And why would an oil company bring back a giant monkey to New York for stage shows? Rewriting the story to take out the entertainers didn't quite go smoothly.Again, Kong looks awful- a man in a monkey suit. It must be embarrassing when a 1976 film is soundly defeated in special effects by a 1933 one. Dwan was attractive (though no Fay Wray or Naomi Watts), but when we have her shower scene and see her bare hips, for the life of me I couldn't figure out why that was necessary. What's much worse, I couldn't believe the sheer stupidity of her line, "You goddamn chauvinistic pig ape! You want to eat me? Go ahead!" I guess it was the production quality that made her suicidal.The only reason why parts of the movie were enjoyable was because they were taken from the brilliant original. King Kong '76 itself brings nothing worthwhile to the table. And so, it wouldn't be until 2005 that we finally got the remake we deserved- and Kong could regain some of his dignity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A murky,turbid perception lays at the basis of every remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole idea of remaking a film you love rests very obviously on an extremely turbid and confused perception. I may understand a sequel; it's ignoble, mercantile at best, but it's understandable. But a remake?Why remake CASABLANCA,THE MALTESE FALCON,KONG,STAR WARS,JONES (the same is true for ET, Bruce Lee's pictures, you name it ?),if the movies themselves (and not merely their ideas, legends, concepts, etc.) are what you like?To update?what? If they're up-datable, it means they are no longer valid, they are deficient, so you do not love them anymore as much as you said.One can remake a film he does not quite like?or not entirely, completely, wholly ?.The movies you love, you do not remake?because of too strong a sense of their concrete _substantiality ,to use a Petrescian notion. What you love?you love unrestrictedly, as it actually is, not as it should be, or as you fancy it should be ?.The form is definitive, molded in bronze. One wishes to remake the movies in which he senses imperfections, flaws, deficiencies ,etc..If you remake it, you (no longer) like it as it is; if you update it, you sense it is obsolete.I guess you remake only what is unsatisfying. There is no such thing as a remake. You do not remake it; you simply put up another movie?better or worse.The Mme. Lange version lives by echoes; its life is a borrowed one, its flame is indirect; it has no life in itself. It is a huge error.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the 1933 original, it is movie magic at its best. Yes the special effects were crude back then but that doesn't take anything away from the fact that it is a classic film. You cannot outdo perfection and I personally think De Laurentis and the others were fools to even try. I think they thought that big budgets and better special effects would make this a better film-IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. They might has well have tried to re-write "to be or not to be". Jessica Lange went on from this mess to become one of our most respected actresses, and one of the few to win TWO Academy Awards. She deserved a better film to debut in. Jeff Bridges and Charles Grodin are also fine actors who deserve a better film. An intersting story I read, actually a rip-off. There were books and magazine articles at the time that came out and said that they were building a huge mechanical Kong-it turned out to be a total lie. The scenes were all with just a man in an ape suit!!What a joke. Its a little hard to watch this film now because the final scene is at the World Trade Center. Folks take my advice, rent the original and see a great film, this one is a one time experience. By the way, the great Fay Wray is still with us. She is 97 this year. I wrote to her a few years back and she kindly sent me an autograph.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instead of the innocent, almost child-like beast in the 1933 classic or the last of his kind and platonic love in the 2005 version here Kong is turned into nothing more than a pervert who lusts after an air-headed actress named Dwan. And instead of bashing Dwan to the ground and stomping her to death, Kong and us are forced to hear Dwan spew some of the must gut wrenching dialog ever written. And Dwan sets back the liberation movement by 50 years with her dim witted and damsel in distress shtick. Dwan even enjoys it when Kong fondles her with his large finger and blows on her. Disgusting!! And get this the villain is big oil. Boo!! Hiss!! The big oil exec, Fred Wilson, is our wimpy villain. This guy is so wimpy he hides behind the gate and barks orders to his men on the other side in their attempt to rescue the kidnapped Dwan. And he's almost as dim witted as Dwan when the oil find he's been hoping for turns out to be a bust he gets the bright idea of capturing Kong and bring him back to the U.S. in some stupid traveling attraction as the oil company's new mascot. Really? Smart move.Then our human hero is Jack Prescott who has to be the most unlikable hero I've ever seen on screen. I really don't know how anyone can like a hero who sneaks aboard the ship via bribery, becomes a stowaway and lies and steals his way throughout the film. Plus he's the most arrogant, smug know it all ever.And that's just the characters. Then you have the laughable effects that are hardly any better than your average Japanese Godzilla film. How this film ever won an Oscar for Visual Effects I'll never know.I used to be able to find this film somewhat enjoyable, but as I grow older I find more and more wrong with it.This is a King Kong sized turkey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KING KONG (2 outta 5 stars) This is, of course, the 1976 Dino De Laurentis remake and not the original black and white classic. I don't think I ever saw this movie when it first came out (beyond the occasional snippet I might flip through while channel changing) but I finally broke down and decided to watch the whole thing. Wow... it's amazing how inept special effects could be in those days! Did they shoot *any* footage on a real island? Is anyone watching this movie able to accept for even one minute that "Kong" is anything but a guy in a mangy gorilla suit? (Except for the one or two shots of a hopelessly fake-looking immobile statue that they use towards the end.) The actors do their best... Jeff Bridges plays the long-haired rebel hero about as well as it could be done... and Charles Grodin does okay as the villainous oil man who tries to exploit Kong. Jessica Lange tries her best (in her film debut) but there's no way ANY actress could overcome the dopey dialogue she is given. ("Why, you g*dd*m chauvinist pig ape!" "What sign are you? No, wait, don't tell me! I bet you're an Ares, aren't you?") Still, she does look quite attractive in those skimpy costumes that keep falling off of her body... and obviously, that was all the producers cared about. I mean, Kong practically strips her naked with his finger! He's fondling her chest! What is this, soft-core porn for giant apes? Moderately entertaining, but for all the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When my Kong-a die, every body cry! Teachers, intellectuals, everybody!" Thus spake John Belushi as Dino De Laurentiis on SNL, and was he wrong! When this Kong-a died, I breathed a sigh of relief-a and regretted the time spent-a watching it. Talk about lacking a clue as to the difference between the letter and the spirit of the original! There were a few good things: unlike either the first or latest, it did show how they got the big ape off the island to New York, and the scene where Jessica L talks to him in the ship's hold was touching. Some of the opticals when KK was climbing the WTC were gorgeous. But everything else--fuhgetabouddit! The fx were awful. A complete list would take pages and pages, so I'll mention just a few. On the island they didn't even bother to match colors between the live action (green) and the studio ape suit fx (red). There was one monster, a snake that harked back to the octopus in "Bride of the Gorilla." One shot, of Kong smashing a gunship, was blatantly repeated. And the NYC model was totally empty and sterile-clean when he went for his stroll--sniffing out the heroine!! What could be funnier?? Rick Baker did what he could with the ape suit but it wasn't much. I've created a special "Survivor" award for actors and actresses who manage to make careers after awful kickoffs like this one. It's called the Jessica in honor of Ms. Lange, from whom I never expected to hear again (the 2nd recipient was Michelle Pfeiffer for surviving "Grease 2"). The only real consolation is that this atrocity actually, unbelievably, Could Have Been Worse--originally Dino D wanted to use the wretched full-sized robot used in the stadium scene for the WHOLE PICTURE! And this guy had actually made moves before! I understand Willis O'Brien's widow wept at "King Kong vs Godzilla"--what tears she would've shed at this thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original King Kong from 1933 isn't exactly my favorite movie (nor my favorite monster movie) but I found it OK. You can't say the same about this total stinker. They made some changes, most of them to the worse. Initially, I like it when they change certain things for the remake because it normally makes it more watchable for those who have seen the original. Sadly, they decided to have almost no fighting between King Kong and other monsters on the island this time. That was some of the best parts in the original, and because of that I got disappointed. Another change is that they used the World Trade Center instead of the Empire State Building. I liked that change, but the whole thing was badly executed by the movie makers. The special effects were rather bad, and worst of all, the story is absolutely rubbish. The reason for that is because they had to drag some environmentalist crap into it, and that made the whole movie very irritating and stupid. Jeff Bridges made a good effort in destroying this movie with his hippie-style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty enjoyable until Kong shows up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* 1/2 out of ****I'm not sure what it is about King Kong that a lot of filmmakers seem to find appealing. I guess maybe it's just hard not to find the concept of a giant ape that just wants to be left alone with his bride interesting. Hollywood's infatuation with Kong led to this 1976 remake (with another coming up), which actually boasts a large budget and a respectable cast.I have actually never seen the original King Kong with Fay Wray (blasphemous, I know), but I am familiar with the story, and little appears to have been changed. Instead of heading out to Kong's island to shoot a movie, the expedition is actually headed by an oil-drilling company that's intrigued by the massive amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere around the island, believing it could mean large oil deposits. A stowaway on board, primatologist Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges), thinks there's some creature on the island and is out to prove it. Conveniently floating on a life raft nearby is Dwan (Jessica Lange), a would-be movie starlet who's rescued by Prescott and the crew. Immediately, he and Dwan find themselves attracted to each other. When they arrive at the island, all hell breaks loose when it turns out the natives there are worshipping (and offering brides to) a giant ape named Kong, who takes Dwan as his latest bride.For about a half-hour, King Kong is an enjoyable diversion. The scenes on board the ship do an effective job of setting up an intriguing and mysteriously creepy premise. The expedition's arrival at the island is appropriately awe-inspiring, thanks to the lush jungle setting. For a while, I actually thought I'd like the film.But it couldn't keep the quality streak up. Once Kong shows up, the whole movie falls apart. The very first sight of him is blatanly unconvincing, obviously nothing more than a man in an ape suit that's been superimposed onto the screen. The ape suit looks fake and the imposition effects are pretty terrible, often with matte lines or grainy background footage visible. This film won the Oscar for best special effects? Must not have been tough competition that year.The natural island setting is a great location, but it's often juxtaposed with sets that appear to have been taken straight from a 60's B-movie. This is most noticeable in two scenes, when Kong shakes a bunch of people off a log bridge and when he arrives to his "home." I realize effects alone shouldn't really determine a movie's quality, but plot and dialogue aren't exactly this movie's driving force.And even with a fine cast, neither is the acting. While Jeff Bridges delivers a typically solid performance, most everyone else is subpar. In her debut, Jessica Lange is on-and-off, mostly the latter, and she gets the movie's single most memorably idiotic bit of dialogue (listen to why she mentions her name is Dwan). It's Charles Grodin, however, who severs any possible link of decent acting. Bearing an astonishing resemblance to Michael Gross (and even acting like him!) of the Tremors series, Grodin is just awful, enunciating much of his dialogue like he's twitching in constipation. His character is so irredeemably greedy and evil, you can imagine it must have taken all of Grodin's willpower to not twirl his mustache every other scene. The film concludes in the streets of New York City, with Kong predictably wreaking havoc and mayhem to everything in sight in his search for his one and only bride. The model work is shoddy, like watching a 50's Godzilla movie, only without the intentional camp. The final scenes are meant to be poignant, and for some odd reason, I actually felt a little sorry for the titular monster, even though I knew the whole time it was just a guy in ape suit. I at least have to credit the movie that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie last night for the first time since seeing it on the big screen nearly thirty years ago. I remembered it being bad, but I had mercifully forgotten just how bad it is! From the lame attempts to inject an environmental slant to the cartoon characters to the total lack of any sort of excitement, this movie simply has nothing going for it. For a film which was quite expensive in its time the production values are miserable. Kong's island looks just like Hawaii until you get inside the wall (a bunch of sticks) when it becomes just a handful of fake rocks and a miniature tree or two. The scenes where Kong "rampages" through a suddenly empty Manhattan are substantially less fun (and less convincing) than even the worst of the old Godzilla movies. Rick Baker has proved himself the master of the ape suit, but you wouldn't know it from the costume he wears in this thing --- he looks like he should be menacing Abbott and Costello. All in all a movie without a single redeeming quality.Wait a second, I take that back. Jessica Lange is cute as hell.</fullReview>

Jackson's 2005 version borrows one important aspect from this film - the reciprocation of Kong's love by Ann. In the 1933 version, Ann remained terrified of the beast.

True, there is an animatronic model, but it's on-screen for only a few moments, though it's so static and unrealistic that maybe that's a blessing. It also looks nothing like the suitmation Kong.It's true that the original Kong had love interest, but here that's taken to extremes as dramatic action is replaced by a Fay Wray wannabe cuddling a giant rubber finger. In fact there are no dinosaurs at all, the only thing Kong fights on his island being what looks like a novelty draught-excluder. There is an excellently moody soundtrack and some nice scenery, but they're just wasted. This film might provide entertainment, but it ought to have been much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, considering its big budget and great bloodlines, turned out to be one of the most godawful films ever made. It has a bad script, terrible dialogue, sophomoric attempts at humor, a simplistic depiction of corporate culture, and well, you never get past the illusion-killing man in the monkey suit playing Kong. Key dramatic moments borrowed from the original are poorly judged, and even 40 some years later, come off as technically inferior to the stop-motion animation and matte work of the original. (Watch Kong in that log-crossing scene.) Well, at least the film is consistent.There are a few inventive moments, and Kong's facial expressions sometimes work, but there is no sense of mystery here, and little emotional heat--where the original King Kong in 1933, is a model of how to build and sustain tension. The stadium scene near the end of the remake, is dreadfully lacking in atmosphere. Watch it, and you'll come to appreciate how good...the original was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I write this review we have 3 definitive King Kong movies.The best is of course the wonderful 1933 version which even today has stood the test of time. Then we have the 2005 Peter Jackson Kong which updated the story with spectacular special effects and a touching friendship between Ann and Kong. Finally we have this hilariously awful version. Where do I begin? How about the dialog which includes gems like 'get your hands off me you male chauvinist ape!'. Poor Jessica Lange made her film debut here,and its a testament to the actress's skill that she was able to overcome this embarrassing beginning and go on to have a fine career. Jeff Bridges is in full liberal hippie professor mode here,stowing away on the ship with a bribe then acting all holier than thou the rest of the journey and chastising scenery chewing Charles Grodin for being greedy. Then we have Kong,a ballyhooed special effect that consists of a man walking around in an ape suit on toy sets. Riveting. Could this movie be any worse? My advice is this,if you are drunk or high or maybe looking for a campy movie then give this a shot. If not then do yourselves a favor and steer clear of this bomb.

		<fullReview>I tried to give this a 3. Then a 2. But really, this is an awful film. It gets a 1. And I'm pretty generous with schlocky type movies.I saw this as a 14 year-old, and I liked it. Now I suspect even 14 year-olds will find it corny.The effects, acting, directing, and plot are all bad.(I thoroughly enjoyed the recent Peter Jackson remake. I wonder if I'll laugh at that in 20 years?) Jessica Lange has bad teeth, fake boobs, an unbelievable character that spouts laugh-out-loud dialogue, and chews the scenery (which is hard to do against Kong). Go see her in 'Frances' instead.Rick Baker walking around in a monkey suit looks like, well, a guy walking around in a gorilla suit.The rubber hands bend as they grab Dwan (omg, even her name is funny, and listen to her explain it in the dialogue).There is no chemistry between the two leads.Carlo Rambaldi, the special effects guy, does much better work a few years later on 'E.T.'. His Kong stuff looks amateurish. It was a thankless, impossible task to build a 'giant robot' Kong! Lol, just typing that is funny.Even the last shot is funny, as some goofball is waving to the camera. I'll bet to this day he is proud of that (you can see it in the upper left).I could go on and on. This is NOT a guilty pleasure for me, as some post. This is cornball junk, and poorly-made to boot.I looked up the top ten grossing films for 1976. King Kong is number 5. Every other film on that list is better, and that is a 'populist' decree, not critics'. 'Rocky', 'Silver Streak', 'The Omen', 'Marathon Man', 'All the President's Men', etc. Go see those.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Kong! Bad Kong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1970's both film uber-producer Dino De Laurentis and Universal Studios were competing to bring a remake of the 1933 RKO classic King Kong to the screen. De Laurentis made his opus and Universal eventually scrapped their plans to produce theirs. It would have been interesting to see what Universal would have cooked up, because it couldn't be any worse than De Laurentis' mangy dog of a remake. The 1976 version of King Kong is a key example of why film buffs bemoan the announcement of any remake of a classic, simply because they don't want it to turn out like this.Admittedly, there are supporters of this version of King Kong, including online movie critic James Berardinelli, but I am not really sure what they see in this film. It is not a complete waste of celluloid, but it's negative aspects, to me, far outweigh it's positive ones. Updated to modern times, King Kong opens in Surabaya, Indonesia, where Petrox Petroleum executive Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin) is launching an expedition into the Pacific to locate a strange island detected by satellites. Wilson believes that the island is a huge cache of oil (This film was produced during the height of the energy crisis of the '70s), and plans to mine it for all it's worth. Stowing away on the ship is Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) a professor of simian biology who believes that something incredible is located on that island, and it's not oil. En route to the island, the ship picks up a sole survivor of a yacht that capsized during a major storm, Dwan (Jessica Lange, in her first movie role), who falls for Jack on the trip. Arriving at the island, Wilson discovers it is inhabited by a native people who kidnap Dwan and offer her up to their god: a twenty-five foot tall ape dubbed Kong. Prescott leads a group to save her, while Wilson determines to salvage his trip by hatching a plan to capture Kong and use him as a mascot for the Petrox corporation.This version of King Kong does exactly three things right: it updates the motivation to go to the island appropriately for the time, it gives a more significant amount of development to Kong and Dwan's relationship and it has a great score by composer John Barry. Most everything else in this Kong is a miss. First and foremost, unlike the original film, where Kong was brought to life by the magic of stop-motion animation, here, we are treated to a man in an ape suit running around miniature sets. A man in a bad ape suit, running around bad miniature sets. Almost all of the film's verisimilitude is tossed out the window when Kong appears on screen. The ape suit is so poor, and the obvious miniature sets he inhabits are so lame as to be laughable. This was the state of big budget film-making in the mid-70's? Yes, I am aware this was 1976, not 2006, but that was one year before audiences were dazzled by Star Wars, and that has held up to the test of time. King Kong pales by comparison.On the acting front, Jeff Bridges is competent and delivers a decent performance. Jessica Lange is also okay, but she is so hamstrung by her ditzy character that she becomes annoying at times. But the prize here goes to Charles Grodin, who overacts and chews the scenery so mightly, you wonder if there were any sets left to shoot on. You can occasionally forgive an actor who goes over the top, but Grodin is way, way over the top, and he quickly renders his character buffoonish and ridiculous. King Kong is not supposed to be a realistic movie, but Grodin makes his character such a caricature that we can't believe in him for a moment.I must give credit where credit is due: screenwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr. does give some depth to the scenes between Kong and Dwan (by the way, a character named Dwan? What was he thinking?). She begins afraid of him and then manages to form a bond and, in Dwan's case, a feeling of empathy for the great beast. This aspect of the film works, and is it's lone screen writing bright spot. The romance between Dwan and Jack is dead on arrival, we don't feel much for these two, and his environmental message is a bit heavy-handed.By the time this sad affair draws to a merciful close, millions of viewers are witness to the slaughter of an American classic at the hands of filmmakers who seemed to be interested in merely making a buck and not honoring an iconic film in Hollywood history. And people wonder why remakes are usually considered the work of Mephistopheles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have yet to see one American movie produced by Dine De Laurentiis that was worth watching. When I saw this in fourth grade, I thought it obliterated the story of the original in exchange for political-correctness. Now that the 70s are over, I see this as a giant waste of time. There is no storytelling skill, the FX composition (vital in a film like this) are atrocious--especially that rubber snake, and the acting makes the original look like the Godfather. How did Jessica Lange go from this to Tootsie?Overall, skip this movie entirely and stay with the memory of the original. I'm not trying to be nostalgic, I'm just anti-stupid, and the 1976 remake of King Kong is stupid. I wonder what Peter Jackson is going to do about it? 1 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There once was a song by The Hollies called "King Midas in Reverse" and that should be Dino DeLaurentiis' theme song. Any time you see his name in the credits that should tell you that the film stinks. But, this film is the one that most people point to as his biggest bomb. As another person commented, Dino DeLaurentiis is nothing but Ed Wood with a big budget.When I was ten, my younger cousin and I passed up watching Super Bowl XI to go and watch this garbage. Now I wish I had stayed home to watch that game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Riddled with cheesy, hokey special effects, a lumbering overlong plot, campy dialogue and cardboard characters, this misfire has little to recommend it. There are a few good moments but nothing to shout about. It goes on forever and I found it frequently boring.And it's never scary; it completely lacks intensity.And it takes 30 minutes to even get to the island.Jeff Bridges looks like he's doing a preview of "The Big Lebowski".Jessica Lange looks pretty but is required by the script to act like an idiot (most of the time).Rene Auberjenois emerges from his small role with a few tattered shreds of dignity.Charles Grodin seems to be trying to impersonate comedian Paul Lynde.No wonder I've never heard of this director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A charter member of the NEEDLESS REMAKE HALL OF FAME --- see LOST HORIZON, THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS, and BEDAZZLED for others. It's one thing to remake an effects-laden film and take advantage of advanced technology to make a better film, but KING KONG does just the opposite. It's effects are worse than the '33 version! There are times when Kong is clearly a giant robot...a robot with a low battery to boot! In many scenes, it's just a man in an ape suit. Somehow, this junk won a special Oscar. Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange and Charles Grodin have the leads and manage NOT to embarrass themselves despite the nonsense around them. Lange is stunning in her first film and Bridges wears a shaggy haircut and beard. Who encouraged Grodin to grow a mustache and wear a silly safari outfit? He and his outfit get what they deserve. Directed by the remarkably untalented and consistently bad John Guillermin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconvincing Monkey Business (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original King Kong features a jerky, stop-motion ape. The 1976 remake features a man in an ape suit. The jerky, stop-motion ape is better.You first realise that the 1976 Kong is a complete stinker when the giant ape kidnaps Jessica Lange. Up until then the film is mildly diverting. Yeah, Jeff Bridges seems to be an expert on everything under the sun (apes, medicine, ancient tribes, photography etc.) and yeah Lange runs about like a mentally handicapped child in Daisy Dukes (who would have ever thought that she'd turn out to be such a fantastic actress?), but it's well shot, its got a magnificent John Barry score and updating the film so that the greedy capitalist is in the oil business rather than show business is a nice touch. But then Lange is sacrificed to Kong by the tribe and everything is flushed down the toilet.The appearance of Kong himself isn't that bad (even though the way it was filmed made me think of the marshmallow man in Ghostbusters), but once Lange is in his grip and they start 'communicating', the film becomes risible. She even calls him a chauvinist pig ape! Right on, sister! Or maybe not? But then she begins hitting his rubber face. And to make matters worse, she then begins apologising: "It's a sign of insecurity, like when you knock down trees." What? And just when it couldn't get any worse, she starts rubbing his hand and calling him a nice sweet monkey. Oh, and she starts talking about astrology. No wonder he bends down and lets her go. Who'd want to date a woman like that? But unfortunately Kong is enamoured; he doesn't respond too well when Lange tries to run off. But the way he stops her is quite amusing. Rick Baker in a monkey suit runs through some rubber trees and then a rubbish robotic monkey hand toys with Lange so she can't get away. It really is quite funny how crap the hands are. They move very slowly and the fingers move even slower, meaning they sort of resemble large fly swats. They have no dexterity so they can only usher Lange about. And the hands are so bad that when they pick Lange up she has to almost position herself into them.The hands are also amusing when they strip Lange ? Kong wants to see the goods. This big clumsy finger that can only move up or down rips her top off. But what does Kong hope to accomplish? Surely they can't mate. But if I know my monkeys (and a well known online encyclopedia corroborates this), then male gorillas only have one-inch penises. So if Kong is five or six times the size of a normal ape, then, well, monkey love might well be possible.Jeff Bridges, who himself resembles an ape with a big beard and Chewbacca hair, certainly seems to agree with me. "There is a girl out there who may be running for her life from some gigantic turned-on ape." And later on there's a great bit when Charles Grodin, the capitalist who doesn't strike oil but decides to make money out of Kong instead, says, "It's not someone, it's an animal. A beast that tried to rape you." In Kong's defence, he was given her by a large tribe. As far as he's concerned, anything that might have happened was entirely legit.But if the 'romance' between Kong and Lange is bad, the action is even worse. One of the worst moments has to be when Kong fights a giant snake. It seems even more immobile than his robot hands. Seriously, Baker in his suit just has to roll about for a while with an inanimate snake before ripping its face off. The matching scene in the original is much better. In the original, Kong grabs the snake by the tail and hammers it over and over again into the rocky surface.I also don't like the way that this Kong is less homicidal. In both films there's a scene where Kong grabs a giant log and tosses men off of it to their bloody deaths. But while in the original he just seems to do it out of spite, here they shoot first. That's nowhere near as much fun.And the Kong show here isn't as good. In the original the crazy filmmaker fleeces lots of rich people of their money, raises a curtain and there's Kong (it makes me laugh because that seems to be the whole show ? you sit there for a couple of hours and look at a chained up ape). But here he emerges from a giant oil pump! Obviously it's meant to be satirical, and yeah its funny the way they make Lange re-enact being sacrificed by the tribe, but its like Kong has gone downmarket. Once he trod the boards, now he's a cog in a marketing campaign. What a sad fate.But the show's bad for another reason. All throughout the film, in long shots, Kong is a man in a monkey suit, but for some inexplicable reason, in this scene, there are one or two shots of a full-scale robot. It moves even worse than the robot hands; it moves like a less agile version of Frankenstein's monster.And the ending is quite amusing in how it's supposed to be tragic. Kong, carrying Lange, gets chased by soldiers with flamethrowers and leaps across the World Trade Centre towers with strings on his back. Then he lets go of his beloved, gets shot by helicopters and falls off the side to the floor where, as he's dying, he shares a last meaningful look with Lange (who has somehow got to the bottom in record time). It's meant to make you cry, but the only tears are of laughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again, a classic is ruined!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An idea of a remake of a movie as old as King Kong is not a bad idea, but don't destroy it! I loved the fact in the original that a motion picture company goes to skull island to photograph something that has never been seen before, but in this version, it is a fricken oil tanker, on quest for oil! Another insult to the original is the lame gorilla suit, instead of the iconic stop motion Kong, created by Willis O'Brien. There are no Dinosaurs like the original, and I remember Ann Darrow Bieng a cute classy women, not some kneel mouth bimbo! Another big mistake, is that they tried to Modernize it, you don't modernize a classic like King Kong! The one thing that really ticked me off was the fact that the end of the movie took place on the world trade center, and not the Empire State building! That was classic, and I loved that part, I cried, but I loved it. And they left out the famous line, "It wasn't the airplanes, it was beauty killed the beast." Said by Carl Denham. If you want to see a good Kong remake, see peter Jackson's master piece version of King Kong, and cast this piece of crap excuse of a King Kong movie out of movie History!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch the remake recently and I was not impressed first of all this movie was to promote a new discovered actress Jessica Lang and to honest I'm quite surprised it didn't ruin her career,the special effects was very poor, the effects in the 1933 version were far superior and there is a scene in the movie were kong is smiling like a dirty old man has he tries to undress her the only true tribute to this movie is the twin towers has they were used instead of the empire state building they are in the middle of doing another remake I hope this one gives the original the tribute it deserves,when kong escapes his chains and go on the rappage in America the model of kong is so bad it just stands there rigid and raises his arms, it's quite laughable really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible remake that was totally unnecessary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Kong (1976) was a total waste of time and money from the always bankrupt producer Dino De Laurentis (he didn't learn his lesson then and he'll never will). He threw a lot of money at this turkey. The end results was that nobody came out to this movie in droves and it cost him dearly. The direction was ham fisted, the special effects were terrible (they should have stuck with stop motion puppets instead of some clown in a gorilla suit) and the finale was a joke. To top it off, the running time was well over two hours (the bad direction and pacing made it feel like five hours).The changes to the original plot and story were unnecessary (that's what ruins a lot of these remakes, don't fix what ain't broke people). You expect a movie that has the special effects crew of Rick Baker and Rob Bottin would have better effects than the ones on display. A shame really, after all that money they threw at this production you'd think they would have put on a better show. The only thing cool about this movie was the original theatrical poster. It shows stuff that has nothing to do with the movie. If it did this movie would have been watchable. Instead it's an example of what happens to a production when you have a lot of money and no discernible talent. Like Hollywood productions today!Npt recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director John Guillermin (The Towering Inferno), this remake is nowhere near as good as the 1933 original masterpiece. For one thing, it changes the whole reason to go to the mysterious island, the guy in charge, Fred Wilson (Beethoven's Charles Grodin), is instead looking for a new source of oil, the male lead Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) is a stowaway, and the lead girl Dwan (introducing Golden Globe winning Jessica Lange) is a castaway actress who escaped a sinking ship. Anyway, they get to the island, surrounded by fog, find the tribe, who offer her for sacrifice, and along comes their god Kong (played by special effects artist Rick Baker), who takes away, and starts falling in love with her. Another change is the battle with a T-Rex, it is instead a giant snake and is over pretty quickly. The oil they find by the way couldn't be used, so they instead caught Kong, and plan to exploit him as a promotional gimmick for the oil company. Kong escapes, after seeing Dwan being mobbed by reporters, there is a little chase, and Dwan lets him take her, and he climbs one of the World Trade Center/Twin Tower buildings, the final big change. Eventually he is attacked by flame throwers and then helicopters, and being fatally injured he falls his death (although there is a sequel 10 years later, King Kong Lives, where he is just in a coma). Oh, and there's no final quote about beauty and the beast! Also starring John Randolph as Captain Ross, René Auberjonois as Roy Bagley, Ed Lauter as Carnahan, Mario Gallo as Timmons, Jorge Moreno as Garcia, Jack O'Halloran as Joe Perko and Live and Let Die's Julius Harris as Boan. Rick Baker, best known for special effects in An American Werewolf in London, the Thriller video, Ed Wood, The Nutty Professor, The Grinch and Planet of the Apes (2001) playing Kong is very curious, especially seeing his facial expressions, so sleazy, ridiculous giant hands and giving a "blow job" (blowing to dry Lange off). Bridges is the wrong man, Lange is very cheesy, and you have to remember it was her first film, and she still won a Golden Globe, and the film itself, as soon as Kong arrives, it goes down hill all the way, and to be honest, you are relieved when he finally dies. Bizarrly this won the Special Achievement Award for visual effects at the Oscars, and it was nominated Best Cinematography and Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Production Design/Art Direction, it should have surely got some Razzies. Poor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Terrible Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There`s a few things that caused me to dislike this film , namely that director John Guillerman fails to bring any excitement or other worldliness to " Kong Island " , compare the locations used here which resemble Hawaii ( You`ll never guess where the location filming took place ) with the original movie . Oh and the man dressed up as a giant ape looks exactly like a man dressed up in a monkey suit . It must have hard for the cast to take King Kong seriously . In fact `s my main criticism about this remake , it`s very poorly acted . Jeff Bridges has always been good at playing cocky jack the lad types in films , but here he has all the charisma and charm of a tree . Jessica Lange is okay at standing around playing Dwan the supermodel but as soon as acting talent is required like showing fear or any other type of emotion she fails . Strange that Lange and Bridges continued to work in Hollywood with great acclaim after their performances here because they are fairly awful . I guess they were treating the film with the respect it deserved . Hopefully Peter Jackson will show Hollywood how to do a remake</fullReview>
