		<fullReview>They don't make comedies like this anymore. It's got a bit of the mad-cap silliness of the era, as though people could be ridiculous and think it somehow made sense. God, sometimes I wish that were so. The characters bicker constantly, yet that never seems to stop them from getting along. Wouldn't it be fun if life were really like that? This film makes it seem as though it could be. It's about three westerners who share the Tokyo apartment of one of them during a short-lived housing crunch arising from the '64 Olympics. It's a very slight premise, but it serves to propel a gem of a light-hearted comedy. The humor is droll, dry, witty, and acerbic. But, there's a sense of we're-all-in-this-together that keeps the film on the fun side of the line that divides confusion from conflict. If you like "The Gilmore Girls," but would prefer a little more sedate pace, you'll love this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific Cary Grant comedy !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an absolute must see for all Cary Grant fans !!! It is a superb twist of romance and comedy.. although surprisingly it's not Cary whose on course for the romance, rather he plays the matchmaker !! and wonderful he is at it too !!!There are many highlights to this film... watch out for the way Cary talks his way into sharing Samantha Eggar's flat, and when he runs in the race in his boxer shorts and vest !!! (a hilarious moment) and finally the most heart rending moment when he's outside at the end of the film and he lets the shutters go up between the two lovebirds, allowing them to be be together !!! Will definitely make you say aww !!!This film is absolutely brilliant and definitely in my top 5 Cary Grant films !!a must for Cary Grant fans !!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tokyo Location</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure that Cary Grant was dangled the prospect of a nice all expenses paid for location shooting in Tokyo for his final film, Walk Don't Run. It's the reason he did the film I'm sure. It's not a bad film to go out on, not near as good as say The Shootist was for John Wayne, but no Cuban Rebel Girl like Errol Flynn had. It's a remake of an earlier Columbia Pictures hit, The More the Merrier that starred Joel McCrea, Jean Arthur, and Charles Coburn. Coburn got a best supporting Actor Oscar for his performance and Grant has his part.The original film dealt with a tremendous housing shortage in Washington, DC during the World War II, a crisis of four year duration as opposed to a few weeks in Tokyo where because of the Olympics of 1964 there are no hotel rooms to be had.On a whim, visiting industrialist Cary Grant answers an ad for a room mate posted at the British Embassy by Samantha Eggar. She gets the full court Cary Grant charm and after a bit of reluctance, allows him to stay. Then Grant lends half of his half to American Olympic athlete Jim Hutton. Eggar has a fiancé, but foxy Cary works his wiles on both Samantha and Jim. The results are obvious.Walk Don't Run has a few funny moments, Cary Grant style, especially when Grant strips down to his underwear to talk to Hutton during Hutton's event which is the long distance walk. He also has to pry Eggar's fiancé away to get Eggar and Hutton together. John Standing is Eggar's fiancé and he puts in a droll performance as a dull predictable British civil servant.Cary managed to mine a few more laughs out of his last screen role, but you decide if the trip was worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near Classic; Breezy and Very Amusing; Cary Grant's Last Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was probably launched as a "Cary Grant" vehicle, a remake of "The More the Merrier", but I suggest it is a major comedy for several other reasons. As William Rutland, peer and genial businessman and busybody, Grant is mature and good; but involving him in the housing shortage in Tokyo during the 1964 Olympics was a stroke of near-genius. Adding in the old storyline about a girl planning to marry for money and introducing the right man for her instead, in the persons of Samantha Egggar and Jim Hutton, was better, with Grant acting as matchmaker. But making Hutton a member of the US Olympic team and keeping his event a secret, adding in a comedic Russian spy, the smallness of their shared apartment which Grant sublets to Hutton after wangling his own way in, plus visiting a Japanese household of friend Miiko Taka with Eggar and fiancée John Standing, he of the "tall forehead" and boring personality, was I claim pure gold comedically speaking. Charles Walters directed this satirical comedy in breezy style, with story by Robert Russell and Frank Ross from Sol Saks' and Grason Kanin's inspired story. The cast included besides the principals George Takei as a Tokyo police officer, Ben Astar as Dimitri the bumbling Russian spy, skilled actor Teru Shimada as Taka's father, Lois Kiuchi as her mother, Ted Hartley as Yuri, Hutton's Russian fellow athlete-friend, and hundreds of others in bit parts and small roles. The very genial music for the film by Quincy Jones was low-key and delightful; Henry Mancini supplied songs also; the cinematography by Harry Stradling Sr. was lovely from start to finish; and the production designs by Joseph C. Wright were varied and serviceable through. Outstanding scenes in the narrative include I suggest the way in which Sir William's trousers keep disappearing, the attempt by Grant in underwear to enter the Olympic walking event to obtain a signature on a document from Hutton, the party where Grant suggest to a lady Russian shot putter that she put her derri?re somewhere else than in his dinner, the trip to see Eggar's friends (the Kurawa family) and the police station scene, among others. This is a sometimes slick and always amusing and I find frequently very-involving story filled with characters that seem unusually real. It may have begun as a Cary Grant vehicle; but I find Hutton is brilliant, and it became despite a bit of over- lengthy presentation a classic as a romance, a comedy concerning overcrowding and a presentation of very memorable characters whose general theme is how one need to deal with life by means of honesty rather than by taking the seemingly easiest path. A favorite of many, many filmgoers, myself included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Final Film for Cary Grant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk Don't Run" begins well enough and seems to be perking along as another enjoyable Grant comedy but at some point the film becomes unhinged. Lame gags are dragged out too long and let's face it neither Samantha Eggar (although stunningly beautiful) or Jim Hutton are in the same league as Grant. The film picks up again near the end during the scenes at the Olympics. It's disappointing to see Grant trying his best to wring the most comedy he can out of what is an inferior script. The Tokyo setting helps a little, especially in the early scenes, but as Cary Grant's swansong stick with the terrific "Father Goose" featuring a much better cast than this half baked fluff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very charming film with a great cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely charming film with a great cast. Cary Grant, in his last film, is in tip-top form as a British millionaire industrialist and his co-stars Jim Hutton, Samantha Eggar and John Standing also turn in excellent performances. There are some very funny moments- (not least at a dinner for the Olympic competitors) and the screenplay is a real joy. It's full of witty asides and great one-liners. The story line is believable and the plot flows naturally- nothing appears contrived. Watching this again one is saddened by Cary Grant's decision to retire after making it- his performance showed that he still had plenty to offer- even when not playing the main romantic lead. And it's also sad to think of the premature demise of Grant's co-star Jim Hutton- who had such a marvellous gift for light comedy and who he died far too young at the age of 45 in 1979. Hutton will probably most be remembered for his definitive portray of Ellery Queen in the wonderful 1970s TV series- but he puts in his usual five-star performance in Walk Don't Run too. All in all, I thoroughly recommend this film- you'll have a warm glow inside you at the end of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking Tokyo 1966, and Breathtaking Cary Grant, Last Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk Don't Run (1966)In my book, Cary Grant can do no wrong, and he absolutely makes this movie. It's a bit of a 1960s farce, and is maybe exactly what everyone was reacting against with the shift in movies around this time to greater realism and pertinence. This has neither!But that's okay, it has beauty (the sets, architecture, and widescreen filming are all really fabulous) and innocence, which is weird to remember. Even sweet romances from our time, like Sleepless in Seattle, don't have the same pure innocence of this, which I think is genuine in its own way. The scene is mid-60s Tokyo, which is hard to beat for interest (and great cars). The plot? Oh, I'm not sure it actually has one that matters, except boy meets girl. It's mostly like a super high class situation comedy, and the comedy is more important than the situation. And more important than both is Cary Grant, who is in great form. Yes, Jim Hutton is there (and he's fine but forgettable) as well as the female lead, Samantha Eggar (who is not as fine, but is fine anyway, and also forgettable). But then there is Cary Grant. There are even some odd gay gaze moments, where Grant, and the camera, check out the legs or body of a man (Grant, though married, was also gay, it appears). If you catch it it's almost shocking, but perhaps the audience was so innocent, as well, it was thought of as simply funny.So: drop Cary Grant beautifully in Tokyo and create a nonsensical series of little gags, and you have it. And it's Grant's last film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sir William (Cary Grant) is a British CEO who often does business in Japan. However, as he arrives in 1964 for his latest deal, the Olympics are about to begin. Despite having reservations at his usual hotel, Willie is two days early and there is NO room. Peeved and tired, Sir W goes to the British embassy for help. But, oh what a piece of work at the front desk. This under-ambassador is stuffy and no help, even when his annoying demeanor changes to obsequiousness when he learns just WHO this man is. While waiting in the lobby, Willie spies a notice for a room for rent and leaves the diplomat chatting on the phone. When the businessman turns up at the apartment, its rented by a beautiful young woman, Christine (Samantha Eggar). Stating flatly that she wants a FEMALE roommate, Sir W wont take no for an answer. Its soon settled, even down to the times each will have the bathroom for use. Before long, two other big matters occur. First, to his horror, Sir William discovers Christine is engaged to the disagreeable under-ambassador! But, fortunately, another man, Steve (Jim Hutton) is in town as an Olympic athlete who also needs a place to bunk. Without asking C, Sir W brings him home. Now, the happily married bizman has one priority besides his deal making. He wants to get Steve and Christine together, despite her engagement and despite Steve declaring he is not the marrying kind. Can Sir W win at matchmaking? This vintage romcom from 1966 is cute and engaging. Grant is great as the man with romantic advice, Eggar is lovely and funny as the woman with two unexpected roommates and Hutton is wonderful in looks and comedy. What a great trio! With a nice supporting cast, the unusual Tokyo setting, gorgeous costumes, a clever script and an energetic direction, here is a film to please. You probably guessed this viewer would say it but, what the heck! Walk or run to the nearest place to get this one for an evening's watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a remake of a 1940s film, but the supersaturated Technicolor and all the other '60s aesthetics &amp; sensibilities make it an iconic film n its own right. There's so much that made this movie memorable for me: the dialog, the cast, the location, the music... this was actually filmed during the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. It was Cary Grant's last film and he is very amusing as Sir Rutland. The rest of the cast are equally endearing &amp; unforgettable. It was funny how many scenes of this movie were still fresh in my mind after so many years, like Christine's kimono, the two Japanese kids on the stairs, the coffee percolator, the hilarious walking marathon, the shoji screens (which themselves were like characters in the story.)

		<fullReview>I have always loved this movie. It was a typical light, romantic comedy that Cary Grant was renown for and it was a perfect vehicle for him to transition to the older man supporting role. It used all his talents for keeping it light, witty and intelligent without it being slapstick. I was sad to realize it was Grant's last movie as he could have had another ten or twenty years playing such roles. It was our loss. I also like others in the cast despite others criticisms. Eggar and Hutton had just the right amount of chemistry. Setting it during the Tokyo Olympics made it contemporary for the times. And unlike many other 60's movies this one does not date itself all that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grant's swan song in a typical Grant style film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grant never won an Oscar, but has become one of the most acclaimed film stars ever. For those who find this film "trite, dated, and boring" I dare you watch it without laughing at least a few times and smiling a few more. This film accomplishes what most of us pay to see - it entertains without being preachy or sending a message. Not that this last effort doesn't have a message. Smantha Eggers fiancé plays the bureaucratic type we have all meet through the course of our lives, and it fun to laugh at him.This film is a remake of another film made during WWII. It was about another crowded city, for a much more serious reason. The War had drawn tens of thousands from outside the city, to fight the largest war yet. Movies for war time audiences(the film industry was at its height) were not interested in "message movies", they just wanted a few hours of light entertainment and a bag of popcorn to forget about the War.Grant's career, which everyone seems to think remarkable, was made up of a staple of films that expose his comedic talents. "Bringing Up Baby and "The Bachelor and the Boby Soxer" are no more or less than "Walk, Don't Run" but the meat and potatoes of Grant's films. He did made some films, like "Destination Toyko" which could be considered a serious melodrama aimed at helping the War effort, but his pairing with Tony Curtis in a film about a pink submarine was far more Grant-like in that it was funny and more entertaining to watch today. What age does to any art form is most important in judging its value as an art form."Walk Don't Run" doesn't pretend to be serious-its a comedy. If it makes you laugh or smile, its mission has been accomplished. Whether it makes money, was only important at the time the film was made. It now belongs to the Ages.If someone is looking for a message, I think the film is about the last truly amateur Olympics. Some have described Hutton's character as a dullard. I would describe him as ambitious, unpretentious, and a true amateur sportsman. Since he finished 10th in the Walk Marathon, he represents the average athlete-only a few go home with medals.Everyone who looks back at any film, novel, or play, must remember the time in which it was written. Virginity and social correctness meant one thing in 1964, just as they mean another in 2007. Who knows what they will mean, if anything another 43 years from now? Just as Oscar Wilde's "The Importance of Being Earnest" was a satire about Victorian society which doesn't exist anymore, the play is still being performed today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Light Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant's last film is in many ways a typical Grant performance. He does light romantic comedy in this 1 more time. The supporting cast is OK with the late Jim Hutton being the most talented.The film itself is amusing but kind of rough around it's edges. I am not sure why, but the pace of this film doesn't feel entirely right. Maybe it has to do with Grants advancing age or maybe the Director was trying something new which just doesn't work all the time.Whatever it is, the chemistry between the actors &amp; actresses suffer &amp; it shows in the film. Granted, this is not supposed to be art though this role for Grant is pretty much typical of his other films. There are a few decent laughs in this one &amp; if you like Cary Grant, enough here to watch.Don't mistake it with his classic work like in the film North By NorthWest. Call this one way far east.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yuk. I made the mistake of watching "Walk Don't Run" as a double feature with the original, "The More the Merrier." What a mistake! Perhaps if I'd never seen The More the Merrier, I'd have appreciated Walk Don't Run but, unfortunately, the remake pales in comparison to the original. Charles Coburn was SO much better in the lead role than Cary Grant (I can't believe I'm even saying that, I'm such a huge Cary Grant fan). It is fun seeing Grant poke fun at the fact that he's finally gotten too old to convincingly play the part of the guy who always gets the girl but, other than that joke, the update just doesn't work. Such a shame that this was Grant's last film. I'll just pretend that "Father Goose" was his last film and forget he ever made "Walk Don't Run." Save your money, save your time, and just watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this again on TV the other night, and the sad fact is that it's a very dated, formula-driven 1960s comedy that would deservedly be forgotten except for three things:1) If you're interested in the Olympics, it offers one of the few looks at Tokyo during the 1964 games. I'm not sure if any other films use the Tokyo games as a setting. Also, it offers a glimpse at 1960s Tokyo, which apparently no longer exists.2) He was old and graying and his material was awful, but in many ways, this film displays the magic of the great Cary Grant. He rose above lame material one more time, and without him, this would have been unwatchable.3) I will never forget the closing line from the original TV ads for this film: "Run, don't walk to see 'Walk, Don't Run.' " They don't make them like that anymore.</fullReview>

One viewing was enough. It was too...60's formulaic romantic comedy movie-style...Exceedingly dated. It was interesting to see the setting of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and it was a delightful surprise to see George Takei unexpectedly in a small role, but aside from some amusing acrobatics on Grant's part &amp; some cute scenes of his interactions with a pair of local kids, catch it on late-night re-runs if you like but I wouldn't shell out money to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American heel-to-toe competitor in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics cajoles his way into a flat occupied by an attractive working girl and her "roommate", a chipper British corporate executive who couldn't find other lodgings in over-crowded Japan. After a swift, bouncy start, this lackluster comedy seems to lose inspiration quickly, mostly due to the initial set-up compromised by the arrival of the American dullard (Jim Hutton, pulling a Dean Jones). The film is a remake of a 1943 picture ("The More The Merrier"), and sadly it plays like 1943 as well. There is so much lovely chemistry and interplay between Cary Grant and Samantha Eggar in the early scenes, this might've been a totally different (and improved) movie if played as a duet. But once the boy moves in, and the girl's fiancé gets jealous, and the kids are accused of being spies...well, it's not half as bad as Grant being forced into the third-wheel position, playing Fairy Godfather. Quincy Jones provided a nice score, and a few of the running gags are cute, but otherwise this is very tired work. No wonder Grant retired from movies immediately afterward. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant end to a great career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant's last film is an enjoyable, albeit entirely unnecessary, remake of the classic The More The Merrier. That film starred Joel McCrea, Jean Arthur, and Charles Coburn. Grant play the Coburn role as an older man who tries to play matchmaker to a younger couple he is sharing an apartment with. The couple here are Jim Hutton and Samantha Eggar. Poor substitutes for screen legends McCrea and Arthur but both are likable. The original took place during WW2 so it used the wartime housing shortage as part of the plot. This moves things to Tokyo during the Summer Olympics in order to keep the plot intact of Grant not being able to find a room anywhere else. On the whole, it's an amusing movie but probably much less so if you've seen the original. This is pretty much a scene-for-scene remake with few changes. Grant's a rough fit for the role as it is intended but he does give it his best, using his charm and wonderful screen persona to great effect. He's certainly the best thing about the film and, at all times, my attentions were on him rather than his co-stars. Obviously I would recommend you see the classic 1943 film over this. But, if you have seen that, there's no harm in giving this one a try to see a different cast approach the same story. As far as last films of great stars goes, this could be worse. Just look at some of Grant's contemporaries and you'll see some truly sad ways to end a career. Cary wisely knew to get out while the getting was good. That's a lesson a lot of stars could still learn today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant and Jim Hutton Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Columbia had a smash hit film in The More The Merrier with the great Jean Arthur. Cary Grant who made his last films at Universal such as Grass Is Greener, Operation Pettiooat, That Touch of Mink with Doris Day, Father Goose, and the superb Charade with Audrey Hepburn went to Columbia to remake the More The Merrier and called it Walk Don't Run and set at the Tokyo Olympiad. I read that Cary Grant personally sought out Jim Hutton who made all those wonderful MGM comedies with Paula Prentiss as the leading man and Samantha Eggar who starred in Columbia in William Wyler's The Collector as leading lady. Ms. Eggar is no Jean Arthur but then nobody to me can fill the shoes of that incomparable star Jean Arthur. Jim Hutton does well, and I liked his work, and Cary Grant is Cary Grant and that means the best there is. After this film Cary Grant retired despite numerous offers to return to the silver screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fond Farewell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk, Don't Run" stands out in many respects and is as enjoyable the hundredth time as it was the first. No, it's not a great film but it is significant and one that is immensely pleasurable and entertaining.Its significance is threefold: 1. that this film is the last motion picture that Mr. (Cary) Grant performed in. 2. that it brought an innocent portion of the turbulent 60s to light and in doing so, introduced us to (what was then) modern day Tokyo, and 3. that it once again showed us the wonderful comedic timing of Mr. Grant.That this is the last film appearance by Mr. Grant is fairly well known and is a classy comedic classic ending to a film career that spanned nearly 35 years and has since provided us all with untold hours of humor, drama and most of all?joy. This last great performance of Cary Grant was that of a well to do English businessman Sir William Rutland who, while in Tokyo for business during the "famous" housing shortage of the 1964 Olympics, humorously influences a young English woman Christine (Samantha Eggar) into letting him rent a couch and the use of her apartment. Cary Grant's character then, by way of being extremely kind and nosy, brings home an American stray named "Steve" (played by Jim Hutton) who also happens to be stranded and without a place to stay. Jim Hutton's character also happens to be an Olympic athlete (whose secret Olympic event is a running gag) who is waiting for a bed to open up in the Olympic Village but who arrived early in order to see Tokyo and study it's architecture. Although Mr. Grant remains solidly within his trade mark sophisticated persona, he does take on a bit of a Jewish matchmaker demeanor and thus sets out to make a match between Steve and Christine. The results are expectedly hilarious at times and, in true screwball fashion (another Cary Grant trademark), catch Cary Grant at his best as he is either distracting Christine's stogy (so to be 'ex') fiancée so that Steve can better make time with her; getting caught up in a crazy 'spy' subplot that involves Steve, a Russian friend of Steve's and himself; or, near the end of the film as Mr. Grant, again trying to nose his way into Steve's and Christine's business, ends up pseudo-participating in the Olympic games in the "walking race"?but in his boxer shorts."Walk, Don't Run," based on a story by Robert Russell and Frank Ross, is known as a remake of an earlier Robert Russell story entitled "The More the Merrier." In "Walk, Don't Run" however (scripted by Sol Saks), the location of the story was moved from Washington, D.C (Merrier) to Japan (Don't Run). All three or the principals (Grant, Hutton, Eggar) work very well together, with Grant, however, stealing a few scenes here and there with those patented "takes" or "looks" and delivering every line with perfect comedic timing. Funny bits: Trying to make the morning coffee a couple of times?and in a rather helpless fashion?whistling titles tunes from "Charade" and "An Affair to Remember." Getting locked out of the apartment while trying to use the bathroom and then get the milk outside the front door, while being watched by two cute kids?twice?priceless. Mr. Grant trying to understand the morning routine as described by Samantha Eggar's character the first time?and then having to go through the whole thing again when Jim Hutton's character is thrown into the mix. Even the beginning montage where Mr. Grant is trying to get a room in the hotel and is caught in a "bowing" match with some of the hotel managers, all the while finding out that he was not going to get a room for a few days. Not to take anything away from the supporting players either, Jim Hutton shows his comedic ability as he stayed on foot, head to head, with Mr. Grant in many different scenes (the "bath house" and "pants" scenes come quickly to mind). Samantha Eggar is quite good as the "landlord" of the apartment, "manipulate" of Cary Grant as well as the potential love of Jim Hutton?she walked the line well. John Standing is also excellent as the annoying, stuffy, embassy bureaucrat with the wonderfully laughable last name "Haversack" who also just happens to be engaged to Christine (Samantha Eggar) and is also well manipulated by Mr. Grant's character. Star Trek fans will find George Takei as the rather polished cop who is forced to untangle the comedic truth (to a point). There are also a host of other characters who come and go during this screwball comedy, without whom the picture would not have as good as it is. In other words, great casting! A final nod must be given to Mr. Charles Walters' whose direction is solid throughout. This, together with Harry Stradling's excellent camera work, paint a comedic work of art while the music of Quincy Jones fits perfectly the undertones and flow of the picture. While maybe considered a fluff piece by some, "Walk, Don't Run" is certainly a suitable last film for one of the great screwball comedy kings of all time (if not THE king)and whose significance lay in its entertainment value along with that intangible feeling you get watching a master at work (for the final time). If you don't like this film then you just don't get it?you aren't looking hard enough?or are looking too hard, because its intrinsic value is that it exists in the first place and that it showcases one of the "last of the best." It doesn't get any better than that. J. Braun</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not remember how old I was when I first saw this movie but it always gives me this warm fuzzy feeling. The direction and the comedic timing is superb. As Cary Grant's swan song it is done in his inimitable style; subtle and understated. I do not know of any of his movies that I do not like. The humor and timing between the three principals is wonderful. It showcases Jim Hutton (whose early demise deprived us of a superstar), and the timing between the three is wonderful. Everyone is slightly larger than life, and they all make for a wonderful ensemble. Samantha Eggar showcases a side that is not often seen. It is a very enjoyable film, but Walk Don't Run to see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grant's swan song</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That this frustratingly trite piece of ridiculous fluff was the final film for an actor of Cary Grant's stature is too bad. It reminds me of Willie Mays, who, like so many great ballplayers didn't know when to quit and played a year or two too long.However, in this case, never wishing to see Cary hang it up, I wish he would have continued making films until he made one more great movie and then gone out in a far more fitting blaze of glory. But I can certainly understand his frustration with movie making after this bomb and hence, his desire to, as Sherlock Holmes threatened, "retire to Sussex to keep bees." This film is so dated, it's morals so absurdly pedestrian it was already out of fashion when it was released. "Walk, Don't Run" is an infuriating experience. Upon repeat viewings, you could very well end up doing what I just did: got fed up and turned it off in favor of a FAR FAR better film, the great "In The Heat Of The Night" (or any other program) on another channel.</fullReview>

However, since Columbia Pictures churned out WALK, DON'T RUN (probably the most famous film ever made in Japan), Sony Corporation snapped up Columbia the first chance it got in order to collect the treasure chests of royalties accumulating during WALK's semi-annual re-releases throughout that Asian island nation. Besides becoming a cash cow for Sony, WALK is remembered today as one of Cary Grant's best-documented showings in an Olympic competition. Though the world record for the 50 km walk has improved from 4 hours, 50 seconds to 3:32:33 since 1964, there's little doubt that Grant still would be able to stroll along with the best of them if he had not suddenly succumbed in 1986. (Considering that he has born Archibald Leach, Cary may well have won many Olympic medals in the lesser-known events under various aliases and nationalities.) Other than the Tokyo Olympics, the plot of WALK revolves around a Japanese sex toy that enables swingers to introduce newbies to their lifestyle by suddenly lowering the partitions between the bedrooms of adjoining apartments at bedtime through the use of a universal remote control.

It's a remake of a 1940s film, but the supersaturated Technicolor and all the other 60s aesthetic sensibilities make it an iconic film in its own right.

The rest of the cast are equally endearing &amp; unforgettable.

		<shortDescription>A Lukewarm Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the sixties, there were many of these cute romantic comedies that were stuck in a time warp--still dealing with sexual mores that were prevalent in the thirties. Few of them rose above the sappy conventions of the genre. Neil Simon was a notable exception.Run Don't Walk has a few comic moments, mostly attributable to Cary Grant. Frankly, Samantha Eggar is not an inspiring actress here. And Jim Hutton is a straight man by temperament. If there is passion passing between the two, the camera did not pick it up.Watch 1943's The More the Merrier instead. It is the precursor to RDW and shows how it should be done. It stars the funny and desirable Jean Arthur, the witty and dapper Joel McCrea, and the delightful Charles Coburn.One reviewer wrote that Cary Grant quit films after making RDW because he felt he could not handle the leading man roles anymore. That may be. TCM's explanation is that Cary and Dyan Cannon celebrated the birth of their daughter about this time, so Cary retired so he could spend time with his daughter. A pleasant alternative.RDW is filmed in Japan. That is an interesting aspect of the film. Watch this film for its cuteness, but watch The More the Merrier if you want a comedy with cleverness and more magnetism on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, having seen a lot of mixed reviews of this film, I went into it with fairly low expectations. But I wanted to see Cary Grant's last film, even as a curiosity. But I actually found I liked it a great deal!OK, let's be clear: this is no "Philadelphia Story" or "His Girl Friday". There are definitely comic scenes that just don't work. But there are also plenty that do; I laughed out loud several times during the film. I'm still chuckling right now, remembering one of my favorite bits: Cary giving up his seat on the bus.One thing I particularly liked about the film was Grant's character. He's not *trying* to be the suave romantic lead anymore, and he's totally comfortable with that. He's clearly happily married, to the point of having four grown children. He goes through the movie almost deliberately showing his age, struggling to see without his glasses or unable to keep up with all the standing and sitting for toasts. It's almost like it's a shared joke between him and the audience, as if he's winking at us and saying "Yeah, I know, I'm not the young stud anymore. ;-)" But whatever he's lost with age, he's gained in wisdom, a particular kind of wisdom that resonates with me: the wisdom of realizing that's what's most important in life is to have fun. He treats life as an adventure. Note the way that he chooses to stay in the apartment, even when his lavish hotel suite is ready for him. His climbing all over the building. His stripping down and running in the race. His total and instant distaste for the stuffy, no-fun English diplomat. This is *my* kind of character! Reminiscent of someone you might find in "You Can't Take It With You", or even the early Marx Brothers.OK, the sad truth is, Cary is really what makes the movie; without him, it's all pretty slim. The rest of the cast is nothing to write home about. Still, on the whole the writing was pretty good. Some witty lines, and the plot was well constructed. While this is essentially a remake of "The More The Merrier", it really uses only the bare skeleton of that film, and does its own, fresh take on it. Frankly, I consider this "Walk Don't Run" to be superior to "The More The Merrier" (which I found started off excellently but bogged down very badly in the second half), and I don't care one whit that I seem to be the only person who thinks so. Though I will admit that the anal-retentive morning schedule thing was handled better in the earlier film.So, all in all, I think it was a very fitting swan song for Mr. Grant. Not an ideal film, but an ideal character for him to go out playing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the housing shortage of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, two men end up sharing an apartment with a woman. In this remake of "The More the Merrier," the setting shifts from WWII Washington to 1960s Tokyo and the plot has been tweaked, but it pales next to the original. Grant injects energy into the role of the matchmaker (Charles Coburn won an Oscar for the original), but it's sad that his great career came to an end in this lame comedy. Hutton, resembling a young Jimmy Stewart, is likable in the role played by Joel McCrea in the earlier film. Eggar lacks the charisma of Jean Arthur. The humor seems labored and it goes on much too long.</fullReview>

Where the latter is full of flair and wit, this remake is forced and bloated; where the latter is full of well thought-out and interesting eccentricities, this feels like a string of clichéd and unfunny jokes. Cary knows he's in a bad film and although he does a decent job, one can feel that neither his heart nor his mind is in it.My advice, don't bother with this (unless you're set on covering the entire Cary Grant filmography),but do try and get hold of the 'The More the Merrier'.

There's a Russian watcher who provides some plot devices because he is so bad at it.Salted in are recorders and a crowd watching the proposal in the midst of a sporting event.Pah, even with all that, none of it is done effectively and the movie as a whole sinks.The designated cutie here is someone chosen only because of her long red hair and small nose.

This, his final film, would be a disaster without him; as is, it's merely a dull remake of an infinitely funnier and more romantic comedy, "The More the Merrier," starring Charles Coburn, Jean Arthur, &amp; Joel McCrea. It's unfortunate that the Coburn version is remembered mainly as the better version of this story, but at least it's known that it IS the better version.If you enjoyed "Walk Don't Run," hurry to see the original. Cary Grant isn't in it, but Coburn won an Oscar for his work and Arthur &amp; McCrea are perfect together--so much better than Eggar &amp; Hutton that I can't find a phrase to express it. Let's just say that there once was a TV version of "The African Queen" that starred Warren Oates &amp; Mariette Hartley, and Bogey &amp; Hepburn were as much better than Oates &amp; Hartley as Arthur &amp; McCrea were better than Eggar &amp; Hutton.</fullReview>

Cary Grant plays a graceful supporting role, and the final scene with him giving Samantha Eggar to Jim Hutton in marriage is symbolic of him handing over the baton to the next generation of stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's impossible to think what was in Cary Grant's head when he accepted to appear in this silly movie. Even when it came out in 1966 it seemed like a bad idea. After all, this is Cary Grant's last film and instead of leaving with a bang, he disappears with a whimper.It doesn't help that the film, as directed by Stanley Donen, was a weak exercise in its attempt at comedy. True, Mr. Grant is always a luxury for any director to have, but when he is not shown at his best, nothing happens. The best moments of the film show Cary Grant whistling the theme songs from An Affair to Remember and Charade. Well, this is as close to greatness as we are going to get by watching this soulless comedy.Samantha Eggar, Jim Hutton and John Standing do their best to appear interesting, but everything fails. Let's remember Cary Grant for the rest of his work and run, don't walk whenever this film shows on cable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bottom Line on top: I give the film a 3 out of 10 for those viewers who watch this remake film without ever having seen the original. While you are not aware of what you are missing, I am. Therefore, I want you folks reading my review to really get this: If you end up liking "Walk, Don't Run", well then, RUN, DON'T WALK to the TCM site to purchase "The More the Merrier" to have an absolutely fabulous comedy in your film collection to watch repeatedly and share with other TCM fans.I didn't know Walk, Don't Run was a remake when I decided to DVR it. I was 20 minutes in when I recognized positively it was a remake of "The More The Merrier". I watched the entire film; but, I have to tell you, it wasn't easy to stay with it. Why? Because saying this film lacked the Charm, Warmth and Wit of the original is an understatement .. well, if I could think of a word under understatement, I'd be using it. All I kept thinking was how much weaker the script was. How Samantha Eggar was NO JEAN ARTHUR by ANY comparison. How Samantha and Jim had zero chemistry compared to Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea. How Jim Hutton held no presence in the apartment-sharing scenes whether between him and Cary Grant or between him and Samantha compared to Joel with Jean and Charles Coburn. How Jim held none of the animal attraction I felt for Joel as Joel acted his way through this film in and out of the apartment. How I missed seeing Charles Coburn's performance in scenes with Jean or Joel and with Jean and Joel===as well as his typical acting nuances with other characters throughout the entire movie. Heck, I got to a point in the original where I waited for Charles Coburn and his antics to get back on screen, not caring if it would be with Jean and/or Joel?.and I'm feeling that impatience while I'm enjoying the heck out of seeing Jean and Joel's interplay.I did like some of the exchanges between Cary and Jim; and I do believe they did some ad-libs between them that amused each other. I enjoyed rewinding those scenes to watch each man's facial reactions as they played off each other. Here's a huge rub I couldn't overcome. Charles Coburn could never be mistaken by the audience for the man that Jean Arthur would fall in love with from their first encounter on, even when he turned out to be rich. Joel enters that movie and there is clearly Jean's love interest. Cary, however, is 'Cary'. I mean look at and listen to him compared to Jim Hutton. Even if a later reveal gave Jim a 'Sir' title or money?..I still go with Cary, hoping he'll somehow get himself 'single' for me, if he is married.By the way, I watched and waited the entire movie for something about Samantha Eggar to make me give a rip about her and how her role plays out. Never cared. Her mannerisms, speech cadence, sex appeal?sorry?nothing there compared to Jean Arthur's performance.</fullReview>

The results certainly were not as good.The Tokyo 1964 Olympics causes a housing shortage in England leading Cary Grant to share an apartment with Samantha Eggar. Kind-hearted Cary finds Jim Hutton, also homeless in Tokyo and takes him in.The film starts off in an hilarious way when Eggar tries to make a time schedule for using the bathroom, etc.Believe it or not, it becomes downhill when romance develops between Eggar, who is engaged to a stuff shirt British diplomat, and Hutton. With some Soviet running around trying to make trouble, the old idea of espionage develops and an international incident can only be avoided with Hutton marrying Eggar.

		<fullReview>The 1964 Summer Olympics result in a tremendous housing shortage in Tokyo; so, suave British businessman Cary Grant (as William Rutland) can't get a hotel room. With no alternative, he decides to answer an apartment to share posting. Soon, silver-haired Mr. Grant is moving in with beautiful young Samantha Eggar (as Christine Easton). Grant is a little miffed when Ms. Eggar implies her boarder is too old for romance, but he's happily married. Moreover, Eggar is engaged.Next, Grant meets tall, dark, and handsome Jim Hutton (as Steve Davis), and decides he'd be better mate for Eggar than fiancé John Standing (as Julius Haversack). Grant has Mr. Hutton, an early-arriving Olympian waiting for his own accommodations to become available, make it "Three's a Crowd" in Eggar's apartment. Eventually, Grant decides to play matchmaker.The plot ("The More the Merrier") and situation are nothing new, but the cast makes it enjoyable. Grant is especially noteworthy in the scenes after he moves in to Eggar's apartment. His comic physical timing and delivery of lines is often impeccable. There was certainly no reason for Grant to retire, since he appears to have lost little due to age; and, his presence alone made the film a hit. "Walk, Don't Run" is way too long; but, spending two hours in an air-conditioned theater with Cary Grant must have been a cool way to spend time in the summer of 1966.****** Walk, Don't Run (6/29/66) Charles Walters ~ Cary Grant, Samantha Eggar, Jim Hutton, John Standing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of bombs in my time, but this one blasts them all to hell. On the advice of a colleague who insisted this was a fabulous movie that had to be seen, I purchased the DVD. I should say that I live in Japan and am fascinated by any film produced in the West about Japan. I thought this film would qualify. How wrong I was.There is absolutely no logic to a single frame of this film. We are asked to believe that Cary Grant, who plays Sir William Rutland, arrives in Tokyo at the height of the Olympic Games in 1964 two days earlier than he was supposed to, and for reasons known only to God, assumes that the hotel he would have been staying at two days later is going to have a room for him. Why would it? Then he goes to the British Embassy and meets Julius, an obvious screaming queen (but who is somehow engaged to marry Samantha Eggar -- we will meet her soon enough, don't worry), and the second secretary to the ambassador, who is so pompous that you will have to resist the urge to slap his face (especially hard to do since his face is on a screen). Rutland demands that Julius help him find a room. Julius points out to him that it's the Olympics and that there aren't any rooms. Then Rutland magically finds an advert on the Embassy bulletin board seeking someone to share an apartment. The sex is not specified ? this contributes to the big "reveal" as the person seeking "someone" is "Chris," performed by Samantha Eggar, a perfectly beautiful British actress whose talents are absolutely totally wasted in this piece of flotsam/jetsam. Rutland takes a taxi to Chris's apartment building the instant that Chris happens to be arriving home (from what/why/where we will never learn. Shopping? Job? Who knows?). Long story short: Rutland forces his way into Chris's apartment ? literally (and we're supposed to think this is funny?) and essentially thrusts his money in her hand, "making" him her roommate. Chris really is a proper young lady and she's at a loss to know how to get rid of this boorish dolt. The "story" bungles along until we meet Steve (Jim Hutton), the eventual "love interest," who stomps his way through the rest of the film with as much grace as Godzilla. Rutland, "feeling sorry" for Steve because he has no place to stay (and yet has apparently been wandering around Tokyo looking fresh as a daisy), drags him back to Chris's apartment and "sublets" his "half" of "his room." Just imagine the horror of it all! A proper young Englishwoman, engaged, living with two obnoxious boorish clods. Now, Rutland has his charms (he IS Cary Grant), but Steve thinks that he owns the world, shouting, screaming and stomping his way through the movie. I'm sorry, why is this entertaining?Then, again for reasons that remain incomprehensible, Rutland decides that Steve is the right man for Chris, and not Julius. (And yet, why? When he, Rutland, is the obvious best choice for her, despite the fact that he's married ? which we "know" from two cutesy phone calls to his wife, whom he doesn't hesitate to explain about his living situation with a young woman ? all played for laughs, mais bien sur!)The "charming, coy, cute, darling, frothy," and, apparently "brashly good-natured... hilarious" (quote from a review from the NYT) plot goes dump-dump-dumping along, trashing and destroying everything in its path. Entertained yet?But there's more. Why was this film made in Tokyo? There was no reason for it, whatsoever. None. The entire country and its people are just pawns to the special trio who graces the screen. Watching this movie made me cringe at how righteous Westerners were and how they just blabbered away in English to everyone in Japan and just assumed they would snap to. Yes, there were a few laughs that were harmless, based on cultural differences. But overall this was a ghastly, tedious, obnoxious waste of time and it's really sad to know that Mr. Grant sailed out on this "epic." Thank God for "North by Northwest"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad remake considering it was Cary Grant's last film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film a long time ago and liked it a lot more than I did when I saw it again last night. That's because when I first saw it, I didn't realize it was a very, very, very close remake of another film, THE MORE THE MERRIER. And, coincidentally, I just saw THE MORE THE MERRIER again a couple days ago and this really enlightened me as to how poor WALK DON'T RUN really was--mostly because it had nothing new or improved to offer over the original. Sure, the film was set in Tokyo during the 1964 Olympics instead of Washington, DC, but apart from that, it was strictly by the book--but with lesser actors and no special chemistry between them. While I have always loved Cary Grant in films, he just wasn't as well-suited in the role of the sweet and sneaky old matchmaker like Charles Coburn in the original. This isn't much of a stretch more me to say this, as Coburn received and Oscar for his portrayal. And instead of the original lovers (Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea), Jim Hutton and Samantha Eggar are a very pale imitation. Having these two relative light-weight actors take on these roles was almost, but not quite, as bad as having Lee Majors play Gary Cooper's role from a sequel to HIGH NOON (this really DID occur--I'm not making this up).The bottom line for me is that for an actor as wonderful and talented as Cary Grant, it's a darn shame that his last film is just a cheap re-make. He deserved better.By the way, will the IOC ("International Olympic Committee") sue me for using the word "Olympics" in my review? They ARE very litigious about this! Hmmm. Okay, just to cover myself, here goes: The word "Olympic" is a copy-written term and was created by the IOC and is a holy term. It was NOT created by the ancient Greeks, but wholly by the IOC and those who bandy this term about without acknowledging the genius and benevolence of the IOC should, and probably will be, shot. Maybe I should make the same clarification in regard to mentioning "Oscar"--you can't be too careful these days.</fullReview>

Believing it to be her patriotic duty, Connie offers to sublet half of her apartment, fully expecting a suitable female tenant. What she gets instead is mischievous, middle-aged Benjamin Dingle. Dingle talks her into subletting to him and then promptly sublets half of his half to young, irreverent Joe Carter - creating a situation tailor-made for comedy and romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of Grant's Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion - this is Cary Grant's Finest Work - and my Favourite Grant Film.Because seeing him at his finest - the Dean of the Motion Picture Industry.The last part of this movie - was indeed a tear jerker for me - because seeing Cary Grant wave goodbye to two children - and then getting into his car - was indeed the most powerful scene in any Cary Grant Film - Ever! I only wish that Cary Grant made at least one more film! I highly recommend this great movie to all who love great acting, great location, and great love!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightweight but likable swansong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great Cary Grant's final film,WALK DON'T RUN doesn't end the Bristol-born legend's filmography in a triumphant splash like John Wayne's THE SHOOTIST(still arguably the greatest finale to a film icon's career),but it is nowhere as embarrassing as Bette Davis' WICKED STEPMOTHER or Errol Flynn's CUBAN REBEL GIRLS.If there is a one word description for this film,it would be 'pleasant'.There really isn't much else to say about WALK DON'T RUN,accept that it's a remake of THE MORE THE MERRIER,set around the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 instead of wartime Washington,with Samantha Eggar and Jim Hutton in the Jean Arthur/Joel McCrea roles,and Grant reprising the Oscar-winning performance of Charles Coburn as the elderly matchmaker,this time as British businessman Sir William Rutland. Even though he was in his early sixties by this time,'Elderly' is not really an ephitet to think of with Cary Grant.He still looks sleek,stylish and handsome here as he ever did,and is in fact somewhat miscast playing a lovable Mr.Fixit(as Coburn so successfully did) despite his advanced age.But it is thanks to Grant's very presence that the film is watchable. A very inconsequential,wispy and fluffy script,allied with a rather colourless romantic couple (Eggar and Hutton) is totally redeemed by the ever stylish Mr.Grant's double takes,charm and elegance,and his wry delivery gives the mostly flat,stolid lines in the uninspired script some barely noticeable comic depth.Other minor kudos are the Tokyo locations,a genial,uplifting(often whistled) musical score by Quincy Jones(another of his many underrated cinema compositions)and an amusing turn by the upper class actor John Standing as a cheesed off British embassy official,plus other surprises like a cameo from George Takei (Mr Sulu from STAR TREK),and if you catch it,a very brief bit on a TV featuring Jimmy Stewart from THE MAN FROM LARAMIE,dubbed into Japanese!What is pleasing about this final film is that Grant retired from screen acting just at the correct time,not going on like many other film stars into decrepit old age,doing humiliating cameos and character roles like scores of his contemporaries.He alludes to his age here by not getting the girl at the film's end for the only time in his leading man career (the script makes it clear he is a happily married man anyway),but the very final scene, him successfully joining the previously reluctant young couple in an embrace (courtesy of a remote control device) and being driven away by his chauffeur,still looking remarkably untouched by the sands of time, is rather touchingly done.It would've been nicer to see one of the big screen's greatest leading men end his career on a higher note,but WALK DON'T RUN is still a likable and reasonably dignified swansong to Cary Grant's memorable contribution to film history.RATING:6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Cary Grant's last film and it's easy to see why. This is an inferior remake of the much superior The More The Merrier that was directed by George Stevens and had Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn. Here you have Grant playing the Coburn role and he doesn't even compare to Coburn. I can see why Grant retired because i couldn't see him playing supporting roles like Edward G. Robinson. Samantha Eggar and Jim Hutton play the Arthur and McCrea roles and are poor substitutes. I don't know why anyone thought remaking The More The Merrier was a good idea and you would be better off just watching the original 1943 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homosexual Love Story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walk Don't Run" is a terrible film. After seeing the completed motion picture I can understand why Cary Grant never made another film. The plot, script and comedic situations are so contrived that any sense of reality or humanity are devoid. At one point a joke is made about bombs dropping on Japan! The gags in this film are terrible and seem to go on for far too long.Samantha Eggar and Jim Hutton are unattractive and irritating in their parts. Cary Grant still commands the screen but is fighting a losing battle with such poor material.A major concern at the beginning of the film is the meeting and following relationship between Grant and Hutton. It seemed to me as if a homosexual relationship was brewing. GRANT: "I don't know you but lets have a steam bath together, naked and then you can come to my apartment and see my other bed, it's right next to mine!!"HUTTON: "Ok Pops, but will you give me some of your money?"</fullReview>
