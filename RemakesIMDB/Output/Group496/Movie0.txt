		<shortDescription>The great film that time forgot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What otherworldly power decides what films survive in the public mind decade after decade? And what films don't? 'The More the Merrier' is completely forgotten, although in its time, during WWII, it was a huge hit and was nominated for several of the most prestigious Academy Awards, Best Picture, Director, Leading Actress, Script etc. And deserved every one of those nominations. It is, simply a great film, that time forgot, and one that is finally out on DVD. And it remains a mystery how a sexy, sassy, down-to-earth and abundantly funny film such as this could ever be forgotten.In the Washington of 1943, with the housing crisis brought on by the war, single working girl Jean Arthur feels compelled to do her bit and let out half of her apartment. Well-to do businessman Charles Coburn, who has arrived in town too early for a conference and cannot find a vacant hotel room, moves in with her, and, wanting to play Cupid, he sublets, unbeknownst to her, his half of half her apartment to a young soldier, Joel McCrea, on town on a mysterious purpose.Rumour has it that Garson Kanin, of later 'Adam's Rib' fame, wrote the script for 'The More the Merrier', but never took credit. Whoever did it, the premise and even more so the execution of the plot is wonderfully crisp and superbly done. There is not one moment in this film that doesn't work on an extremely advanced level, and as sheer exuberant fun! And the replay value of the DVD is infinite.George Stevens, one of the truly great American directors, has titles such as 'Gunga Din', 'Penny Serenade', 'Woman of the Year', 'A Place in the Sun', 'Shane' and 'The Diary of Anne Frank' to his credit, and 'The More the Merrier' has won a place in that exalted category of masterpieces in all genres. It is obvious that Stevens got a kick out of directing his actors in this movie, creating a many-colored carpet with all this apparently improvised dialogue, so magnificently stylish and at the same time with a looseness, a naturalness in structure that makes the movie feel like a slice of real life.But of course real life was never as wonderful as this! Just imagine having known characters like the ones played by Miss Arthur and Mr McCrea, in one respect they are so typical and easily recognizable, and in another they are so immensely attractive, and not just in a physical sense, that you would want them for your best friends. In a strict Hollywood sense, try and imagine two more gorgeous people in the scene near the end when they, almost but not quite, make out on a the quiet street where they share the apartment! The film is great, no two ways about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily the best film that I've ever seen from George Stevens (and I really like several of his other films). Jean Arthur stars as a woman renting out half of her apartment because of a housing shortage in Washington D.C. Charles Coburn, who is in Washington to help solve the crisis, weasles his way into the apartment even though Arthur didn't want a male roommate. The morning after, Joel McCrea arrives with yesterday's newspaper, not knowing that the vacancy exists no more. No matter, though. Coburn rents half of his half of the apartment to McCrea, unbeknownst to Arthur. God knows this premise could have made one hell of a sitcom, but it also makes a damn funny movie. There isn't an unfunny scene in the entire film, and several scenes vie for the title of Best Romantic Comedy of all times with Preston Sturges' contemporaneous films. The three performers are remarkable. They have great chemistry as a comic trio, and McCrea and Arthur throw sparks off the screen with their surprisingly erotic romance. I failed to mention that Arthur is engaged to an older man, adding to the dilemma. Richard Gaines is also excellent as that fiancé. I love the way his mouth moves. Grady Sutton has a very funny cameo near the end of the film as a waiter. Stevens' direction is exceptional. It's shocking how believably he pulls off the scene in which McCrea and Arthur wander around the apartment without bumping into each other. This is reminiscent of a famous scene from Buster Keaton's The Navigator, and it's even funnier. Or that intimate scene where McCrea gives a carrying case to Jean Arthur. Their acting is so subtly romantic in that scene. I love the way Stevens films it. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always wanted to see The More the Merrier because I heard good things about it. I finally saw it, and I would recommend it to anyone. Not only is it a funny, funny film, it is also so sweet and tender. The scene on the porch between Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea is very romantic and funny at the same time. Charles Coburn, as the older room renter, is very, very good and gives a hilarious performance that won him an Academy Award. Jean Arthur, in a nominated performance, was as funny as usual, she also has many cool hairstyles. Joel McCrea is also excellent in his role. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I suggest that anyone who has wanted to see it, go do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charles Coburn's Oscar: "Damn The Torpedoes..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brief historic note: On August 5, 1864 a Union fleet commanded by Vice Admiral David Glasgow Farragut, attacked the Confederate Gulf Port of Mobile, Alabama. Farragut had a flock of new monitors in his fleet (although he was aboard his flagship, U.S.S. Hartford), and one of the monitors, the U.S.S. Tecumseh, hit a mine (called a "torpedo" back then) laid by the Confederates. Except for the ship pilot the entire crew of the monitor was lost. There was a wave of uncertainty following this disaster, and the Union ships began seeming to fall apart rather than keeping their lines as planned. Farragut, surveying the disaster from the rigging of his ship, yelled through a megaphone, "Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!" The line became immortal - like John Paul Jones' "I have not begun to fight" or George Dewey's "You may fire when ready Gridley" or Oliver Perry's "We have met the enemy and they are ours." Farragut won the battle, and it remains the greatest naval battle of the American Civil War (outside the "Monitor-Merrimac" duel: see IRONCLADS). The victory happened to be the first good news the North had had in months of stalemated fighting (or worse) in Virginia and Georgia. It was the first of a series of victories that helped change President Abraham Lincoln's certain defeat to reelection victory in November of that year.I know that it is odd to begin a discussion of a World War II comedy with a brief explanation of a Civil War battle some eighty years earlier, but Farragut's quote is frequently mentioned in the course of THE MORE THE MERRIER - indeed it is sung at one point in an old song by the real star of the picture, Charles Coburn. The song and the quote show his philosophy of life - to get to the heart of the problem and take care of it effectively.Benjamin Dingle is a millionaire, now doing a "Dollar a Year" job in wartime Washington. There is a housing shortage that Dingle is confronting everywhere, but he finds that there is an advertisement for a roommate that he is determined to grab. It was put into the newspaper by Connie Milligan (Jean Arthur) and Dingle lies his way into getting ahead of anyone else into the apartment. When Milligan points out the obvious sexual problem (male/female roommates?) Dingle points out he's too old for her, and he would actually not be as much of a pest as another woman would be (who might try to borrow her clothes). Subsequently Dingle discovers a young engineer named Joe Carter (Joel McCrae) who also was interested in renting part of the apartment. Dingle decides to rent to Carter, without immediately telling Milligan. There is a great moment when (before Dingle has a chance to tell her) Connie and Joe are able to go through the narrow apartment several times just missing each other.Connie does not mind the problems of renting to two men, as the presence of two men protects her. But she has an understanding with a bureaucrat, Charles Prendergast (Richard Gaines), who is very image conscious and ambitious - so she hopes to keep the renting of the rooms regarding Joe Carter from him. This becomes more and more difficult as time goes by, as she and Joe find they like each other. Dingle notes this and is soon playing matchmaker.The film was a great comic showcase for Coburn. Charles Coburn had been a successful Broadway actor in the period 1910 - 1930s, frequently appearing with his wife in Shakespearean roles. If one goes to the 42nd St. Public Library's second floor there are two portraits of the younger Coburn and his wife in Shakespearean costumes. Then Mrs. Coburn died. Coburn had been (like his contemporary Sidney Greenstreet) rejecting offers to go to Hollywood. He went to Hollywood in 1938 and soon was appearing in good supporting parts, such as YELLOW JACK (he was Dr. Finley) and as the German cancer specialist in IDIOT'S DELIGHT. The parts got larger as time passed: he is the incestuous uncle after Bette Davis (who subsequently finds he's going to die) in IN THIS OUR LIFE. He is the anti-Semitic family head who loathes Peter Lorre in THE CONSTANT NYMPH. He is the sadistic surgeon who cuts off Ronald Reagan's legs as punishment for sleeping with his daughter in KING'S ROWS.As you can see, most of Coburn's parts in the late 1930s and early 1940s were dramatic, and they were getting bigger, but his comic gifts were rarely pushed. His performance in Preston Sturgis' THE LADY EVE was an exception. George Stevens, a director who (like Leo McCarey) had a background as a comic director with Laurel &amp; Hardy, decided to use him in the atypical part of Benjamin Dingle. The part was a large one, requiring a good actor. Coburn did well with it and created (like Greenstreet would differently with Caspar Gutman in THE MALTESE FALCON) a persona that remained his to the end. Coburn would be playing the common sensible, straight talking grandfather, uncle, or elderly friend in films until he died - occasionally varying the role with a bit of silliness like in MONKEY BUSINESS. Here it resulted in Coburn's Oscar for best supporting actor. He'd been in Hollywood five years by then, but his real beginning in film was here - and it was a fine beginning.It was Coburn's second movie comedy with Jean Arthur (the first was THE DEVIL AND MISS JONES), and they certainly play well against each other. Similarly Joel McCrae's comic timing is a sure here with Stevens as it was with Preston Sturges. It's funny how, due to McCrae's long career in westerns, people forget all the screwball comedies he made earlier in his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As zany as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, set in Washington, DC during the early years of the US' involvement in WWII, when DC was still a relatively small city, is sociologically fascinating: the back story is the housing shortage that occurred when everyone descended on the nation's capital in order to organize the country in preparation for war. But the real story is the incredible script, directing (George Stevens) and, most of all comedic acting by Joel McCrea (always the tall, handsome, slightly cynical straight man (whose straightness itself can be hilarious)), Jean Arthur (whose voice I could listen to forever), and, WOW, Charles Coburn as a flustered wealthy tycoon who plays cupid while trying to help solve the country's pressing problems. The comedy is relentless, absolute hilaritas, and it gets zanier by the minute. Very few weak spots in this relatively unknown comedy. Seeing this recently, and a couple of other McCrea comedies directed by Preston Sturges, you have to wonder why Cooper got all the glory while McCrea was frequently relegated to the second tier (despite major box office draws for more serious wartime work).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic war romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film showed how crowded our nation's capital was during the war. Everyone was there trying to sell their ideas or find ways to improve our war effort. Due to this overcrowding, citizens of Washington DC were asked to be hospitable and let people stay with them. This is where this film gets the idea for this confusing, frustrating and romantic tale.Picture pretty little Connie(Jean Arthur) living in the fair city of Washington DC. A hard working girl who lives in an apartment by herself. To be patriotic, she decides to rent out her other bedroom. She didn't figure her future roomie would be a male. Now picture Mr. Dingle(Charles Coburn) is a big wig who has come to town to meet with Washington's big wigs. Good golly, his hotel room has been given away and he can not find another place to stay. Guess where he ends up?? Poor Connie. Now picture young handsome Joseph Carter. Coming to town to show his ideas to improve our flying fleet. He can't find a place either. He runs into our friend Mr. Dingle. Mr. Dingle has a grand idea. Now guess where he is going to stay. Poor poor Connie. Our dear Connie has a boyfriend who she has been dating, FOREVER!! A Mr. Charles J Pendergast(Richard Gaines). Stuffy, by-the-book, close minded bore. Oh my, he won't like this situation one bit. Poor, poor,...well you get the idea.This film is a scream. A great script, great direction, and great acting. A great look back into life during the war and wonderful romantic story. Not to mention Jean Arthur's and Charles Coburn's best performances ever.A classic romantic comedy. You just have to see this!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest romantic comedies ever. The main characters are funny and likable (Joel McCrea is one of the forgotten great romantic comedy leading men of the '30's and '40's), the dialogue is wonderful, and the sense of the period is exact. Two great scenes: 1) McCrea and Arthur on the steps of her apt., he groping her, she fending him off without turning him off--hilarious and sexy; 2) At a factory, a long, long line of women workers is clocking out of work, a male worker (apparently there weren't many) walks toward them, becoming more apprehensive and walking faster as he runs the gauntlet of the women's hoots and hollers (talk about turning the tables)--no revisionism needed here, a primary source for the depiction of the burgeoning of feminism during WWII.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, endearing romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly love this wonderful,endearing romantic comedy from Hollywood's golden age. It has a unique setting - Washington D.C. during the housing shortage caused by World War II, and gets great comic mileage out of the various problems caused by the situation. George Stevens handles it all superbly, but what you remember most are the three charming leads. Charles Coburn justifiedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his scene-stealing panache as the elderly Cupid who helps steer Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea towards love. McCrea was an unsung but marvelously effective leading man in the 30's and 40's - rather like Jeff Bridges has been in his career. He's very fine here, and also in the movies he made for Preston Sturges. And Jean Arthur is at her very best - another great who doesn't get enough respect nowadays. Its difficult not to fall in love with her in this film - even if you were blind, her voice alone would knock you off your feet! Its ridiculous that this was her only oscar nomination-but then she, along with Carole Lombard and Irene Dunne were Hollywood's screwball comedy queens, and Hollywood was too busy rewarding the likes of Greer Garson and Luise Rainer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The romance is stronger than the comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This starts unpromisingly (or was I just in the wrong mood?) with slapstick banana-skin-style gags which, however well done, show their age. Jean Arthur looks unassuming compared with her strong-girl tomboyish appearances in the Capra classics. But come Joel McCrea and the burgeoning love (at first resisted) between him and Arthur, and she shows a vulnerability and a range of expression that round out our knowledge of an already well-loved artist.Charles Coburn, too, after the comic-strip cackhandedness of the first scenes, grows into an enjoyably human old rascal and Joel McCrea, blasé and hardbitten to begin with, develops into a fine romantic hero. The ending (will they, won't they?)recalls the end of the Cary Grant/Irene Dunne classic "The Awful Truth", and if I say that McCrea and Arthur do not pale by comparison, then I could hardly give higher praise than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In her one and only recognition of sorts from the Motion Picture Academy, Jean Arthur got a nomination for Best Actress for The More the Merrier, a screwball comedy based on the housing shortage in Washington, DC. It was a tough field with veteran players like Greer Garson for Madame Curie, Ingrid Bergman for Casablanca, and Joan Fontaine for the Constant Nymph. But a fresh faced newcomer with only two previous film credits under a different and real name of Phyllis Isley copped the big prize. Spiritual and ethereal beat out funny and sentimental that year as Jennifer Jones won for The Song of Bernadette. Arthur's well known stage fright manifested itself in non-cooperation with those that give out the awards. There are all kinds of Jean Arthur stories about her running and hiding from fans, her getting physically sick before shooting a scene and then giving a great performance, her total non-cooperation with the press that covers the film industry. It didn't redound to her benefit at Oscar time. Still The More the Merrier is one of her great roles.My mother's older sister was also one of those government girls who went to work for a flock of new agencies that sprung up during World War II. The country and its people were mobilized to a degree never seen before or since. Would that this president could show the leadership now that FDR showed then against a group of people who would destroy our way of life.My aunt met her husband in Washington who was deferred from military service because of tuberculosis he had suffered. If she were alive she could attest to the things shown in The More the Merrier. Washington, DC simply did not have the housing available for all the folks now working in the capital.Jean Arthur is one of those women and to show her patriotic spirit she offers to take in a roommate for splitting the rent. She gets quite a roommate in Charles Coburn, a millionaire who's been caught without a reservation at a hotel.Coburn was the only one who took home an Oscar from The More the Merrier as Best Supporting Actor. He's one roguish grandfatherly type who decides Arthur needs some male involvement even though she has an engagement of sorts to bureaucrat Richard Gaines. If he was 30 years younger he'd do the deed himself.So when homeless soldier to be Joel McCrea shows up, Coburn gets his matchmaking skills honed to a fine edge. Dolly Levy could have learned from this man.McCrea was at the high point of his career, he was taking a break from westerns and doing some of the best comedies around with Preston Sturges and this one with George Stevens. This was his third and final film with Jean Arthur. He had done the Silver Horde a Victorian melodrama with Arthur as the other woman and Adventures in Manhattan where he was miscast. This one however was a winner in every way for him.Best scene in the film is after Coburn as sublets half of his half of Arthur's apartment to McCrea and they haven't broken the news to Arthur yet. He gets into the shower and while some of us sing, McCrea likes to imitate a seal. Arthur's expressions on hearing the seal noises is priceless. The More the Merrier got a remake in the Sixties with Jim Hutton and Samantha Eggar and Cary Grant in his final film in the Charles Coburn part. It was good, but not nearly as good as the original.Don't believe me, see both and compare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant romantic sitcom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a one of a kind effort from George Stephens who was to really somber up when he came back from photographing the devastation and after shocks of WWII, especially the concentration camps. What he witnessed there kicked the humour clear out of the man.Jean Arthur and Joel Mccrae are amazing in this, ably abetted by Charles Coburn who got an Oscar for best supporting actor.The premise is the very real housing shortage in Washington during the Second World War and how Jean Arthur sublets a portion of her apartment to Charles who in turn secretly sublets his sublet to Joel, almost on a whim.Jean is a very organized person and one of the many jokes in the film centres around her schedules, bathroom, showering, coffee making, etc. in the morning, unwittingly foiled by a bumbling Charles.Sparks fly once Joel enters the picture. And a very real eroticism is generated. Witness the gift and touching of the leather travelling case and the scene on the steps which goes right up there in the 10 Top Romantic scenes of all time. And the scene of eye-talk at the nightclub in front of Jean's fiancé. Breathtaking. Joel just can't keep his hands off her.9 out of 10. An absolutely splendid romp and boy that choir of the homeless at the end. And some of the timing gags. Not to be missed for the fans of the forties B&amp;W's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm tickled pink every time I watch this film. Charles Coburn plays a meddling businessman who invades the apartment of a young woman during WWII's Washington D.C. housing crisis. The trio cast including Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea is stellar. This is a doting film that takes its time with details, yet is warmly effective. The chemistry between Arthur and McCrea is heart pounding (especially the side walk scene!) The magic shared between them permeates the screen. (There's something about McCrea that makes a girl want to fall into his lap.) Coburn's antics as the sly matchmaker are hilarious. "The More the Merrier" is cleverly written and humorously acted. For classic film lovers, this one's a gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty fun, until it grinds to a halt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie (TMtM) doesn't explain this, but I assume WWII-era Washington, D.C., had a housing shortage (exaggerated here for comedy?) because the capital required more people working in the government on war matters. Otherwise I would've thought there'd be surplus housing, with so many men fighting overseas. Thus we have the amusing premise of elderly Benjamin Dingle, a public housing expert of some sort who's arrived in DC too early for his reserved hotel room to free up, wheedling his way into renting half an apartment owned by young Constance Milligan, who patriotically wants to reduce the housing shortage but didn't expect a man to be her roommate.Besides Milligan's act of patriotism, there are other interesting traits of wartime DC/America. An available taxi will sit around and make patrons wait in the back until multiple customers come to fill it up, providing more economic travel. Likewise Milligan carpools with some other women (in what looks like a VW Beetle convertible at first!). And in an ironic reversal, a huge line of working women signing out for the day ogles and whistles at a lone man passing it by.Adding to the historical interest is the fact that this movie came out in 1943, when the time that WWII would end was still uncertain. Joe Carter's grim joke metaphor to describe his work with bomber planes coincidentally foreshadows the end, though. He tells Dingle that he helps build "baby carriages", confusing us until he goes on to say that the carriages deliver "babies" to Tokyo. This joke brings to mind the atomic bomb called "Little Boy" that the US would drop on Japan a couple years later.There's another, unrelated historical quirk about this film. Swears were all but gone from Hollywood movies during the height of the Production Code years. Clark Gable's one use of the d-word in Gone With the Wind was an infamous exception. But in TMtM, Dingle's favorite motto and song involves Admiral Farragut's famous saying, "Damn the torpedoes...full speed ahead", a rallying cry for him (and the audience?). Dingle recites/sings this line incessantly, and it is notably uncensored. As a result, I think this one film from 1943 uses the d-word more than all the other Production Code era films put together! Dingle, and the actor Charles Coburn who plays him, are lower-key than I was led to expect, but the film provides great humor for most of its running time. The comedy includes both quiet repartee (almost none of which is in the "memorable quotes" section here, as of this writing) and slapstick, plus various ironic situations. The staging of the three main characters zipping around their apartment is well-done, particularly in the scene where Milligan and new roommate Carter have yet to be introduced by Dingle. Apparently Dingle isn't ready to do this, and so for a while the other two keep barely missing each other while going about their business.However, there are some head-scratchers that are the result of clumsy and/or dated writing, and I don't just mean Carter scaring someone by joking that he's a "Jap". Milligan claims that her fiancé doesn't have any hair, but when we see him later he isn't bald, only wearing what seems to be a bad toupee. My favorite oddity was Dingle's big housing conference, which for some reason looks to be held in a public park instead of a conference room.Carter and Dingle also have the habit of making choo-choo train sounds for no reason, and in one scene Carter whoops like an animal while showering (!?). Some kind of forgotten forties humor? Also weird is the sudden visit at an awkward moment from some old teenage boy, who begs Milligan to let him in to talk about some crisis that's actually unimportant. He has never been seen until now, and the movie presents him vaguely. He's some kind of neighbor, and the film tries and fails to make him a screwball comedy figure. After he pokes his nose into Carter's business, Carter makes the above-mentioned "Jap" joke, and the kid runs for his life in a silly panic. This even becomes a crude plot device to bring about the film's climax.Besides this weirdness, and the genuine humor elsewhere, the movie is notable for its cute romantic scenes (many of them extended shots) between Milligan and Carter. They are full of romantic tension, and seem rather daring for the time, together with the risque-for-1943 premise of a young woman allowing two men to board with her.Sadly, in the final act the film totally tries to change into a drama. The melancholy that's been lurking underneath now explodes, and things take a high-strung turn, made worse by draggy filming, moping characters, and convoluted falderol for plot. It is neither funny nor romantic, and for that matter the drama isn't touching, in part because it's not clear what's going on and why everyone's acting like this. You can feel the film slowing down. Indeed, you may almost forget about the enjoyable comic and romantic stuff you saw earlier, which is too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scene with Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea on the steps of the apartment is more erotic than anything you will see in an "R" rated film today, or probably even an NC-17 film. The desire that they have for each other, and are barely suppressing, is overwhelming. And the lingerie she wears in the last scene is surprisingly suggestive for 1943. This whole film is an amazing piece of work. Much credit goes to legendary director George Stevens. Charles Coburn was always great, but who knew he had the comic chops he shows here? Jean Arthur's voice alone makes her one of sexiest actresses ever in films. She and Joel McCrea are both terribly underrated. This film deserves to be much better known than it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hilarious Housing Shortage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful comedy that uses the housing shortage in war-time Washington, D.C. to comic advantage.Jean Arthur won her sole Academy Award nomination for this performance, and my only quibble with that is that she was only recognized by the Academy once. She's absolutely adorable here as a type-A career woman who rents one half of her apartment to a doddery old man (played perfectly by Charles Coburn). She runs her apartment with military precision, and the movie's highlight is the scene in which Coburn tries earnestly to stick to the morning schedule given him by Arthur the night before and ends with his pants getting stuck in a tree (you have to see it). Of course there's more to Coburn than meets the eye, and the plot thickens when he rents half of HIS half to a good-looking single man (Joel McCrea) and begins to play matchmaker.This is a delightful movie directed with a sure hand by George Stevens. Stevens could be overly stoic and ponderous when making "important" films, but his comedies rarely fail to entertain. "The More the Merrier" is breezy and fun with just enough meat to it to give it some substance. I can't praise it enough.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean Arthur, Charles Coburn, and Joel Macrea display an on-screen chemistry that keeps me watching the movie--and I have seen it repeatedly. The dialogue is crisp, smart, and funny.As a World War II-era film, it provides a glimpse at what sort of sacrifices were faced on the home front. The situation remains current and engaging. "Sex" crackles throughout the story without resorting to nudity or overt remarks. Coburn's character is a delightful trickster as matchmaker.Even my son, who saw this movie when he was five, was caught up in the movie, often laughing in the right places.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful romantic comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a darling movie! Great acting my Ms. Arthur and her supporting actors Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn. I must say the kissing scene where Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea are on the steps is magnificent! One of the sexiest and most beautiful kissing scenes I have ever seen in a movie. I also think this is a good war time movie that strays away from the typical war time movie scenario. It is a very touching movie that brought a few tears to my eyes yet made me laugh to my fullest extinct at times. It is a very cute movie that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys romantic comedies to sit and watch with a loved one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did this movie slip by me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film for the first time, I'm amazed that after being a classic movie buff for more than twenty years I have never seen it -- I have really missed a treat.First and foremost is that I have an entirely new admiration for Jean Arthur. I had no idea that she had the range that she does and it shines in this film. Her unique trademark squeaky voice is put to brilliant use in the comedy scenes and her timing is flawless and she's absolutely adorable in the intimate scenes. The camera skillfully brings you up close and Arthur draws you in with her subtle but gripping facial gestures and body language. She's incredible. By the end of this movie - the male viewers will have fallen in love with her.Not to be overlooked is Joel McCrea's performance. The way he injects many of the scenes of a man who is falling in love and wants to show his feelings but with a realistic view of the the "game of love" and its unwritten rules. His downtrodden "Yeah so what about the rules" style plays perfectly with Arthur's love sick but reluctant career girl. The chemistry that emerges between them is unforgettable.Charles Coburn's performance cannot be ignored either. I had never seen him pull off such zany comedy before and he's hilarious.The only movies that I had seen Jean Arthur in prior to this one was "Shane" and of course "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington" but after seeing this gem, I have made more attempts to watch out for her other movies when they come on TV. She's made a new fan and "The More the Merrier" will soon be in my personal collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through a series of comic misadventures brought on by a very humorously devious Charles Coburn, Jean Arthur ends up sharing her apartment with Coburn &amp; Joel McCrae in Washington D.C. during a WW2 housing shortage. One of a suite of major movie hits (along with "Woman of the Year" &amp; my all-time favorite starring Cary Grant &amp; Jean Arthur, "Talk of the Town") directed by George Stevens before he joined the U.S. Army and headed a combat motion picture unit during WW2. It is a wonderful, truly wonderful, piece of work. If you enjoy romantic comedies, do yourself a favor and rent it. The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Jean Arthur (although she didn't end up winning that year) and Best Supporting Actor for Charles Coburn, who very much deserved the statue he received for this picture. What a delight. Just a pure delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-tier romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This old, wartime, mostly-forgotten-about little film is a real gem. In a genre that tends to rely on clichés and overused story lines, "The More the Merrier" clearly stands out. The acting, directing, and cinematography are all excellent. Arthur, McCrea and Coburn are all in top form and have a lot of meat to chew in this zany comedy-romance.The country is at war, and the nation's capitol is short on living space and long on eligible young ladies. Jean Arthur plays one such girl who wants to do her patriotic duty and lease half of her spacious apartment to some other young lady in need of a place to stay.That's great in theory, but when a jolly, resourceful, don't-blink-twice retired millionaire (played by Coburn) finds himself unable to secure a hotel room a couple days in advance of his reservation, Miss Milligan (Arthur) finds that he is a tough customer to dissuade. And when Dingle (Coburn) runs into a patriotic young man (McCrea) working on a secret wartime assignment and in need of a room...What follows is great comedy and an engaging romance. Arthur is absolutely radiant and spot on with her expressions and lines in what may be her best film (with many other notables including Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Easy Living, and Shane to name a few). Coburn gets a wonderful part and makes the most of it, making him a joy to watch. McCrea fills in any remaining gap with another solid performance and good material to work with.Aside from the story and the actors, the cinematography, direction and a carefully planned set combines to form a couple unforgettable scenes between Arthur and McCrea. In the apartment, the two bedrooms face the outside wall and are separated by a thin, uninsulated wall. In the first remarkable scene, we experience the intimacy of these two characters as they converse through this wall, with the cleverly designed shot making it almost appear as if the two are in the same bed (quite remarkable for its time with the Production Code solidly in place).The second scene is one I will not describe, but is cleverly executed and makes for the perfect ending to this slick little film. The memory of this movie sticks in your mind, and it is a pleasant memory indeed. Seldom if ever have romantic comedies been this funny, well acted, and sweet. The More the Merrier stands on the very top rung of its genre. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The More The Merrier" has to be one of the most irresistible romantic comedies of the 1940's, and all time. I've been watching a lot of Golden Age romantic comedies of late (think "The Palm Beach Story", "Bachelor Mother" etc) and McCrea and Arthur have as good a chemistry in this film as any other pairing. Arthur is especially wonderful as the lovely, super-organised yet rather lonely schoolteacher who decides to lend out one half of her flat in the midst of a WW2 housing crisis in Washington D.C. But she gets more than she bargained for when both Charles Coburn (delightful) and Joel McCrea (sexy as hell) move in.We know were this one is headed from the outset, but the fun is in getting there. "Merrier" has a wonderful script to go with the great playing of it's stars, and is a gem every film-goer should seek out. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The more the funnier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great romantic comedies of the 1940's. It was a popular film at the time and was nominated for and won many awards. One of the funniest moments in the history of the cinema--I still laugh aloud at this scene no matter how often I watch it--is when Joel McCrea makes some type of seal sound in the shower while flapping his arms. In this part of the movie Jean Arthur doesn't know that she now has two males subleasing her apartment instead of one. Also the routine Jean Arthur makes the two who sublease follow from 7:00 until 7:30 each morning is continually hilarious. I do have one problem with the movie though. It is entirely too long. Why George Stevens drags it out past ninety minutes is not clear. The story should have been wrapped up and tied about fifteen minutes before it is. I find that a lot of famous directors, including Alfred Hitchcock, have a tendency to go on longer than what is needed for the story. Because of this the film does become a bit boring toward the end. It is still funny from time to time. And it is still a great film comedy worth seeing again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wartime Washington was never really this much fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MORE THE MERRIER is one of many comedies exploiting the theme of crowded Washington during the WWII period--and one of the best. Personally, I thought it worked best until the point where CHARLES COBURN (in his Oscar-winning supporting role) was booted from JEAN ARTHUR's apartment over reading her diary.From that point on, the screwball situations became less amusing and the film stretches credibility a bit too far when the comic situations include McCrea suspected of spying on government buildings with his binoculars.The best moments come early in the film, when Arthur insists on clockwork timing to make getting up in the morning (with a roommate) workable. The frenzied rush to keep to her schedule makes for the most amusing moments in the story, thanks to the artful playing of CHARLES COBURN who is delightful as Mr. Dingle, the man who thinks that she deserves a nice, clean-cut young man rather than the stuffy fiancé she's engaged to. Along comes McCrea, and the rest of the plot has Coburn managing to bring the two lovebirds together.Amusing spoof of manners and morals of the period, with JEAN ARTHUR and JOEL McCREA shining in the leads and Coburn doing a nimble job of the cupid-playing Dingle with tricks up his sleeve.The last twenty minutes get a little tiresome, but overall it's a cheerful comedy well worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jean Arthur -- wonderful as always</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean Arthur is wonderful as always. It's hard to believe she was 43 when this was made but, since there is some dispute about her age, she may have actually been 35. There's nothing particularly funny about it but it's a nice film with enjoyable people, it evokes the era well, &amp; you know from the beginning that all problems will be solved &amp; the boy &amp; girl will get together. The scene where McRae &amp; Arthur can't keep their hands off each other is romantic, sexy, &amp; classic. Charles Coburn won an Oscar for Supporting Actor. While Coburn is a cute old guy, i guess, &amp; Joel McRae is fine, it's Jean Arthur who makes the movie come alive. Coburn &amp; Arthur were also in The Devil &amp; Miss Jones which is a similar, &amp; probably better, film. This one was remade, poorly, as Walk, Don't Run in the late 60s with Cary Grant in the Charles Coburn role!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great screwball comedy! The map and schedule bit near the beginning is one of the best bits of comedy business I've seen. Jean Arthur is lovely but a little bit of a wallflower too. Joel McCrea is tall, dark, and mysterious. Charles Coburn is so wacky with his repeated catchphrases, "eight girls to every fella," and "damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead." Gaines as Pendergast is as square as they come complete with awful hair piece. The movie seems a little rough around the edges as if it was under-rehearsed. Especially Jean Arthur, who seems to be stumbling with quite a few of her lines. But it works for this movie, as the action looks more live theatre and spur of the moment, and Jean Arthur's character appears more real. Some of the best situation comedy and verbal jabs in the screwball genre!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quintessential acting trio - Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn, in director-producer George Stevens' gem of a romantic comedy to delightful perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The More the Merrier" is co-written by four screenwriters, Richard Flournoy, Lewis R. Foster, Frank Ross, Robert Russell, and a surprisingly well-integrated screenplay effort, indeed. Jean Arthur is Connie Milligan, the centrifuge of attention; Joel McCrea is Joe Carter the unexpected distraction; and Charles Coburn is Benjamin Dingle, the ultimate Mr. Cupid connection. Miss A is comedienne Goddess alright: Connie is rigidly constrained but not exactly, wants everything according to her plan as expected, demanding adoration &amp; affection at the same time, and capable of delivering very long sentences or speech unfalteringly without a grimace. She's one ball of spitfire, Miss Arthur - Hallelujah and Amen. Perfect casting to match Miss A's quick wit and skillful acting are tall, down-to-earth handsome Joel McCrea and cool, calm, but casual Charles Coburn. My fondness of this movie gem grew with each repeat viewing - appreciating all the nuanced moments evolved, sparked by the irresistible chemistry between Miss A and McCrea, and the endless humor and fun Coburn generates with his twinkling eye. Who would think the mundane subject of 'rent a room' can turn into such combustible drama! What a threesome to watch.The comedic tempo is at its prime impeccable timing as the circumstance on how Arthur's Connie discovers a third party when she came home unaware of McCrea's Joe being in the apartment, as he was simultaneously unaware that the place belongs to a woman landlord, as Coburn's Mr. Dingle did not mention such 'inconsequential' detail when he sublet his rented room to Joe. Adding to the amusing situation is the rhythmic music that anyone (yes, viewers included) would want to swing to anywhere: in the room waiting to use the bathroom, in the hallway just coming out of the bathroom, in the doorway 'hair-raisingly' watching the consequential moment to occur. Imagine the three in that scene - of course you have to see it to thoroughly marvel such flawless pacing at the superb ensemble performance of the trio and the ingenious direction of Stevens, with the deft artistry of editor and sound, cinematography, set decoration, costume and prop design, all inclusive. Joel McCrea swaying in his robe, bare-footed, is simply endearing to watch. Jean Arthur's face as she came out looking so surprised is precious to behold. She is a Goddess who can take any comedic riff and be comfortable with making fun of herself. Bravo! (Can't resist mentioning about the bit with Dingle's pants - truly a quiet hilarious 'Chaplin-est' sequence, indisputably so.) "The More the Merrier" (1943) is actually romantic to the core - the back and forth interplay between Arthur and McCrea is romance in poetry, and the bantering dialog is at once buoyantly merry and witty. Charles Coburn's nonchalant front while playing cupid on the sly is so easy to swallow whole, taking in along with his impish whims and humor. You can see Coburn in another film with Arthur, director Sam Wood's savory "The Devil and Miss Jones" (1941) where Coburn is in a front and center substantial role as an executive incognito - boss to Arthur without her awareness (again) - chaotic fun involving mistaken identity assumptions entangled. In a different subdued role in director Irving Cummings' returning soldier adjusting to family life 'dramady' "The Impatient Years" (1944), Coburn plays the discerning father to Arthur, providing sensible solution to her marriage woes.Yet another absolutely must see is director George Steven's "Talk of the Town" (1942) with the stellar ensemble of Cary Grant, Jean Arthur and Ronald Colman.

		<fullReview>I absolutely adored this film until about the last 15 minutes, and was surprised, considering how good it was up to that point, that those last minutes had so many flaws. But in my opinion, that hardly matters. I'm looking forward to re-watching the first part, and relishing Coburn's impeccable comedic timing and deadpan expression -- his attempts to navigate his first 7:00-7:30 a.m. breakfast/bathroom drill in the apartment left me with a fit of the giggles that I badly needed. Jean Arthur was always wonderful, and she was especially beautiful in this. And I'm glad to see by other comments here that, despite all the efforts of modern filmmakers, genuine romantic chemistry can still be recognized -- hooray! The growing romantic tension between Arthur and McCrea simply sizzles. When the pair are walking back to the apartment and Ms. Arthur keeps managing to shrug her wrap back off her shoulders as McCrea keeps putting it back on, just so he'll touch her shoulders again, you can feel the way her body is winning the battle over her mind, and it's the very essence of sexiness. Ah, if only all those filmmakers who think a pair of naked bodies, some fake sweat, and panting automatically create a sexy scene would watch this a few dozen times and get a clue!! Delicious film in so many ways, and now I'll go seek out "The Devil and Ms. Jones" and other of the Arthur films I haven't yet seen.</fullReview>

Every frame, every angle, every line of dialog is made significant, while retaining a sense of freshness and spontaneity. If you love Jacques Tati, or anything by Sidney Lumet, you will appreciate the precision choreography of The More the Merrier (the title of this movie is the only bad thing about it). Never mind the story-- if you are a movie buff you'll want to watch it like you're finding out how a Swiss watch is made. Even the pauses in the dialog, simple glances the actors give each other, are well-timed and even musical. Nothing seems left to chance... and yet, it's all seamless, fresh, and totally engaging.

		<shortDescription>A really funny "war" movie about the housing shortage in Washington.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a former resident of our Nation's capital, this film captures what makes our Capital unique. It has periodic periods that mimic gold and oil boom towns. Every time there is a "national crises, the city begins to fill with experts who almost never leave. The difference with WDC is nobody seems to leave because the "gold and oil" never runs out. This has created housing shortages that were so aptly and humorously described in this film. It may have been good for the men overseas at the time , to see that the civilians were having problems with the war too.The film has a great Director, George Stevens, and a great cast, including Charles Coburn, an elderly "newcomer" to cinema who won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. If Jean Arthur who was nominated for "Best Actress"was married to David Selznic, I think she could have won. That is a good example that Hollywood was as "political" as WDC.I would have voted for her and leading man, Joel McRae.The only weakness that detracted from giving the movie a "10" was some of the script was a little weak, but the actors made up for that. Without them, the whole idea of an old man moving into an apartment with an unmarried female (this is 1943) AND then his subdividing his space to an attractive and eligible young man is a bit corny. But the idea must have struck future movie moguls as a good idea as it was repeated in Cary Grant's last movie where Tokyo and the Olmpics created the housing shortage. (Walk Don't Run).Watch this film with the family and learn about how the civilians won the war instead of John Wayne. War may be hell, but sometimes it can be funny. I would also recommend A FOREIGN AFFAIR set in Post-War Berlin. Arthur plays an up-tight lady Congresswoman with her special comedic flair. Ask anyone associated with films. Comedy is far more difficult than doing straight drama. For all of the acclaim of a Hepburn or Joan Crawford, they couldn't compete with Arthur. And she could also act. In one of the best Westerns of all time, she played a straight roll of the Western frontier woman in SHANE. It was her last major roll.</fullReview>

One part specifically was confusing, but did not detract from the story. I think you have to know about the period in which the movie was created to completely understand it. This movie has a lot of historical context, ie. the overcrowding of Washington, D.C., and how paranoid authorities were during the time of WWII. This context makes the movie much more interesting.

		<fullReview>I think some of the reason I like this film so much is that it re-pairs Charles Coburn and Jean Arthur--who starred in the magnificent little comedy, THE DEVIL AND MISS JONES. They had great chemistry together the first time and once again, they work splendidly together. Joining them is the ever-capable Joel McCrea and together they make a terrific cast in this little comedy about the war-time housing shortage in Washington, DC. Coburn is exceptional and at his best as the VERY manipulative but sweet old meddler. In addition, the writing and direction are generally on target and everything combines to make a dandy film. The only MINOR problem is that the film, on occasion, seems to "try too hard"--in other words, occasionally, unsubtle moments invade this nice film and disrupt the flow (such as McCrea's bellowing in the bathroom--what's up with that?!). Despite a few flat moments, this movie is a great example of excellent and sweet material coming from the Golden Age of Hollywood, and unfortunately, they don't make 'em like they used to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious smash comedy set in WW II D.C.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The More the Merrier" is set in Washington, D.C. smack dab in the middle of World War II. The housing shortage of the time and place sets up the plot for this wonderfully funny movie. Jean Arthur is Connie Milligan who does her patriotic duty by advertising to share her apartment. Charles Coburn is Benjamin Dingle, a businessman who arrives in the city two days early for some government business and finds no hotel space. He weasels his way past a long line of people waiting to see Connie about her apartment, and convinces her to accept him. While Connie's off to work the next day, Dingle rents half of his half of the apartment to a young man, Joe Carter, played by Joel McCrea. One can guess where this story will go as Dingle plays cupid and matchmaker for Connie and Joe. But the humor is over the top funny as the trio go from situation to situation. There are scenes with little or no dialog that resemble slapstick one would see from the Three Stooges or Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello. A small supporting cast contributes to the fun, but this film is mostly a three-person show. While Connie and Joe are excellent in their roles, it is Coburn's Dingle who is the heart of the comedy.Coburn has never been funnier. This second lead and top supporting actor didn't arrive in Hollywood until he was 56. But over the next nearly three decades he made almost 100 movies. He played dramatic roles, in historical and biopic films, and others; but his forte was comedy. In most instances he was a straight man, or a stern character with clever repartee. Never was he funnier than in this film. And, I can't recall any scenes in his many films in which he smiled, but he gives a huge ear-to-ear grin in this film. Coburn was most deserving of the Oscar he won as best supporting actor in "The More the Merrier." This was the first Columbia movie to be held over by theaters across the nation. It was an obvious hit with audiences in 1943, and it should continue to delight people of all ages these many decades later. Besides the comedy of the three leads, this film gives a glimpse of life in the American capitol during WW II. That is, a glimpse of the social life. Washington then was known for its ratio of eight women to one man. The film scores that point with a little humor as well with a couple of scenes. In one, a line of women whistle and gawk at a man who walks by. And in a restaurant scene with Connie and Joe, some women are dancing together, and when Connie goes to powder her nose, Joe is immediately surrounded by a bevy of beauties. It may be hard to imagine a sudden huge housing shortage in any city today. But the situation in Washington, D.C. was very real during WW II. Two factors contributed to it. The number of government employees increased dramatically to staff the many new offices and jobs related to the war. And, droves of single women were arriving to replace men who left every kind of job imaginable to go off to war. The families of the men who went off to war were still there in their homes. So, new housing had to be found for those moving into the area. The Good Housekeeping magazine issue of January 1942 had a feature article about the "government girls." The article said, "There's a new army on the Potomac ? the bright-eyed, fresh-faced young Americans who have poured into Washington from remote farms, sleepy little towns, and the confusion of cities, to work for the government in a time of national emergency."The article noted that these young women went to work in crowded federal buildings, instant offices created in warehouses, apartment buildings and wartime temporary office buildings tossed up on the Washington Mall. Besides the mushrooming numbers of office jobs for women that the war brought, women replaced men in the local service garages, in the utilities jobs, pumping gas, driving trucks, delivering mail, etc.Those who have lived near or visited the U.S. Capitol know how beautiful the Washington Mall is. Just imagine that toward the end of WW II, more than two-thirds of the Mall was occupied with office buildings. Temporary structures filled the mall along Constitution and Independence avenues. And, the park below the West side of the capitol building was filled with buildings. Only the narrow strip with the Washington Monument and reflecting pool remained open and one could see the narrow park strip from the Capitol west to the Lincoln Memorial. After the war, some of the temporary buildings remained for decades. Some were still there when I worked in the nation's capital in the 1970s. I think the last of the temp buildings were torn down by about 1980. Of course, more permanent buildings had been built over the years to house the larger government that continued to grow even after the war years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I'm out of sync on this one. This film gets high marks from most sources, but not for me. Yet, despite being the genre of film I really enjoy, and despite having a cast I very much like, I don't care much for this film.Jean Arthur is one of my favorite comedic actresses from that era (although she could do drama, as well). Charles Coburn is one of my very favorite (usually) character actors (he stars here) from that era. And while I can't say that Joel McCrea is one of my favorites, I very much like him in his non-Western earlier roles. So, it's not the acting that I have a problem with here.Some younger viewers may not even understand the premise, but in war time Washington (WWII) there was a tremendous housing shortage. This film plays on that history, as the 3 principal characters ends up sharing one apartment. A funny premise. And, of course, Arthur and McCrea fall in love. And, of course, the matchmaker is sweet old Coburn.Funny premise...that seems to go on forever. It's predictable. It just drags.I'm not saying it's a bad movie. Perhaps a bit mundane. To each his own...but this one is not on my DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The More The Merrier represents the screwball genre adapting for the war years, however this was at the end of the genre's original run. I wonder why there was not more screwball comedies made during the war period? Did people become more cynical with the war, or perhaps the genre was simply made for the depression era. Instead of taking on the establishment, The More The Merrier is supporting it. It is refreshing to see a propaganda film from the war years which is less gloomy and shows how common folk got on with their daily lives during the war.My main flaw with The More The Merrier is Joel McCrea. He's fine, but that's the problem, he's only just fine; a serviceable actor who doesn't leave a great impression. The weak spot of a trio of characters who could have been much stronger with a more charismatic actor. Granted this was during the war and most of Hollywood's big male leads where off in Europe kicking Hitler's ass. Could Cary Grant have played the role instead, but perhaps a big star like that couldn't play a role in he doesn't show up until half an hour in. The trio of characters still manages to be fun with Jean Arthur playing the straight man and Charles Coburn as an immature and conniving old man who still seems like a kid at heart, while the romance between Arthur and MrCrea is still believable and handled very well as they spend the final third of the film quietly denying their feelings for each other.Jean Arthur and Charles Coburn are one of the more unconventional screen pairings in Hollywood, starring in three films together, just look at the morning schedule scene; comic choreographed brilliance and by far my favourite part of the film. When McCrea enters the picture though I feel it is never as strong. Also after you watch this movie you may find yourself saying "dam the torpedoes, full speed ahead!" a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel it's important to mention some caveats before I start gushing about this movie: I don't enjoy every single scene of The More the Merrier, the last comedy George Stevens ever directed. Occasionally the film feels dated, and all the casual talk about "Japs" is bound to make other modern-day viewers feel uncomfortable as well (though it's worthwhile to keep the context in mind). But when The More the Merrier hits its stride, it's funny, sweet, romantic, daffy, and everything a great screwball comedy should be. It's terrifically enjoyable without denying the realities of the time.We're in Washington in 1942, when the proliferation of war jobs and servicemen passing through resulted in a huge housing problem. Even an elderly retired millionaire like Benjamin Dingle (Charles Coburn), who arrives in the city as a Senate-sponsored consultant two days ahead of schedule, finds that he is not guaranteed a place to stay. The cheerful, gleefully manipulative Mr.Dingle finds a room for rent in the paper, fools a gaggle of other prospective tenants into getting out of his way, and railroads the apartment's occupant, prim government worker Connie Milligan (Jean Arthur), into letting him stay. She wanted to rent to a woman to prevent raised eyebrows among her neighbors (which, given the time, was certainly a risk), but she barely gets a peep in before Dingle's setting up shop.After unilaterally deciding that what his pretty, somewhat tightly wound roommate needs is a "high-type, clean-cut, nice young fella" (and epically failing at sticking to Connie's baffling morning schedule) Mr. Dingle proceeds to rent half of his room to another prospective tenant. He finds one in Sgt. Joe Carter (Joel McCrea), a soldier set to ship out to the front in a week. Dingle initially tries to keep Joe and Connie from noticing the other's existence, but that can only last so long. Connie is unable to kick out either of her new roomies and so attempts to adjust, though she makes it clear that she's engaged to her boss and so off the market. But Dingle, a self-appointed cupid, has other ideas--he senses that this Mr. Charles J. Pendergast is a stuffy bore (he's right), and slyly maneuvers Connie and Joe toward each other. It doesn't hurt that the two seem to operate on the same wavelength (an adorable early scene has them both doing the rumba by themselves in separate rooms). Eventually they cannot hide their attraction to each other, though the war inevitably gets in the way. The performances are what make The More the Merrier irresistible. Coburn, delightfully cheeky, won an Oscar for his turn as the benevolently Machiavellian matchmaker. But the chemistry between Arthur and McCrea deserves special mention. It's a wonder that their scene on Connie's front stoop got past the censors--while there's nothing R-rated, things get a little "tactile"--but it's breathtakingly sexy. The next scene, where the thin wall that separates their bedrooms allows them to talk to each other, is equally powerful in a more poignant, understated way. I think this movie has made me a lifelong fan of both actors. The film has some flaws--some slightly unconvincing crying, and the aforementioned "Japs" issue--but don't let that deter you. There's a reason the term "underrated classic" so often follows the mention of The More The Merrier. In some ways it's a product of its time, but its emotional grace notes about love, lust, and taking risks haven't aged a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess "Gone With the Wind" set the precedent for scare tactics to lure audiences using evil guttural utterances. Pish posh, in your dreams friends. This film was a dreg.I've had many male roommates and of course this led to many romantic opportunities but as a business arrangement, I NEVER went there, and at times this was eXtremely difficult, but rules are rules. And let me tell you these gents were not of the wooden unemotional daft Joel McCrea types.I had a hard enough time with "Walk Don't Run" but I soldiered through this first installment with grit. The "Schedule" routine was tedious but gave it some slack thinking the payoff would be forthcoming. Not the case here folks. This farce is dreadful at every turn. The split screen tactic in the bedroom may have it's foundation here but guess that's where the creativity ends.Perhaps if there were more sightseeing tours of DC in the 40's it could save the day? I guess I could recommend to round out your collection of Arthur, Coburn and McCrea. But not likely.... Big Sigh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Housing Shortage Was Never Funnier than This ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The World War 11 housing shortage in Washington, D.C. served as the basis for this rousing 1943 comedy.Both Charles Coburn and another guy soon share an apartment with the perky Jean Arthur, who is engaged to a diplomat.Arthur, a perfectionist, has a working schedule that just doesn't work out and Coburn was so hilarious in those scenes that he was rewarded with a best supporting actor Oscar for the year. Amazing to me that he was able to win in a year with Akim Tamiroff in "For Whom the Bell Tolls," and Claude Rains for "Casablanca," were both in the running.As the other guy, who Coburn rents out his apartment to, Joel McCrea gives a restrained, quiet performance as the guy who quickly falls for the Arthur character.The ending might be somewhat inane, but the fine direction by George Stevens, and the characters themselves, blend for a memorable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only came across this movie recently as it was shown on TMC. What a treat! I had not seen any Jean Arthur pictures before - I have to say, she was one lovely lady. I won't repeat the plot details, but just comment that the sidewalk and kiss scene was fabulous. You know that Joe (McRae) and Connie (Arthur)are destined to kiss, but the buildup goes on and on.All the while, Connie is warding off the octopus treatment from Joe, without really wanting to, and pretending to be nonchalant and detached. And when the kisses come, they take her breath away. Certainly among the great screen kisses.One point I don't think anyone else commented on: When Connie first mentions her then-fiancé Charles J. Pendergast, she says offhandedly that he has no hair, is bald. But when we see Pendergast a little later on, and for the rest of the movie, he is wearing a blatantly ill-fitting and mis-tinted toupee. In the restaurant scene, Pendergast makes a point of ducking under some ventilation fans; no doubt to keep his hair on straight. No one says anything, but you know why he did it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Comedy: Subdued, Successful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't begin with much in the way of promise. Coburn has come to the crowded Washington, DC, in 1943, where real estate is at a premium. He bluffs his way into sharing the multi-bedroom apartment of Arthur, who is engaged to a rather dull bureaucrat who wears an obvious toupee. While she's at work, Coburn decides to invite Joel McCrae to join him in sharing the bedroom. Arthur returns, discovers what's happened, and tries to throw them both out. Too jammed up, you know. People bumping into one another and having trouble scheduling baths. It all sounds a little like a pilot for a failed television sitcom with a name like "Three's A Crowd." But it picks up interest as the plot takes its inevitable course. The foxy Coburn manages to get the engaged Arthur and the soon-to-leave-for-Africa Sergeant McCrae married. Was there ever any doubt? Three things save this gentle comedy from mediocrity. George Stevens' direction is just about flawless. He was later to go on to some splendid dramas, like "A Place In The Sun", and a superb Western, "Shane." But he had earlier handled comic material, like Laurel and Hardy shorts. And in 1943, a time when the typical comedy had turned frenzied, he's slowed things down considerably. Yes, there's a pratfall or two, and someone's trousers disappear out the window, but as the romance progresses the comedy becomes nuanced.I assume that it's the director who decided to break the fourth wall -- pretty innovative for the period unless you're Berthold Brecht or somebody. The audience is addressed directly (but wordlessly) twice. The first time, Arthur discovers that Coburn, on the other side of a paper thin wall, can be as clearly heard as if he were next to her in bed. She turns a stunned face to the camera and stares. Nice try, but no cigar. A bit later, the phonograph is playing a samba version of Cole Porter's "What Is This Thing Called Love." The rhythm is infectious. Arthur begins to sway to it in the kitchen. In the hallway, the pudgy Coburn listens for a moment then begins a few clumsy steps. On the climactic note, he turns directly to the camera, puts his fingers behind his ears, and does a little grind house bump. Bingo!Another thing that makes it a little different from others of its period genre is Joel McCrae's performance. McCrae had done a lot of light comedy before and was always convincing as the breezy, light-hearted, easy-going guy next door. Not here. He plays it rather glum and humorless, which makes his comic lines that much more effective. I don't think he ever laughs, and he only rarely smiles. Stevens gets a lot of mileage out of glances and stares and makes the most of what wit is in the script, which isn't too much.If you can get past the opening set up, you'll find a winning movie, full of quiet smiles and warmth. And, while hardly trying, and while studio bound, the movie evokes nostalgia for an earlier American life style when people felt wrapped up in a common enterprise and shared a common goal. Office walls display Liberty Bond posters or other patriotic iconography. On a Sunday afternoon, in the middle of summer, neighbors flock to the roof tops and lie in the sun, chatting, drinking soda, reading aloud the Dick Tracy comics in the newspaper. Much more was being shared than a two-bedroom apartment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I played my VHS copy of "The More the Merrier" for a lady in her 60's whose background is different from mine. But good comedy transcends all differences and unites folks. The need to laugh, chuckle, titter, chortle and guffaw is universal. This lady laughed the way I laughed when I first saw this movie - like a fool. She kept remarking "oh, no!" and "oh, my goodness!" as situations popped up. "The More the Merrier" is such a funny movie. My favourite scene is the stroll along the sidewalk where Jean Arthur's mink stole keeps slipping slyly from its appointed place on her bare shoulders and Joel McCrea's hand keeps finding its way to said shoulders, to curtail the mink's restless behaviour. That scene crackles with more heat and sexual tension than I have seen in most movies, no matter how explicit. This movie strikes me as rather risqué for its time, and if you think about it, the whole thing is a tease leading up to that final gag - and it's a doozy! It should be everyone's sacred duty never to reveal it to anyone who has not seen the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Our vagabond camera"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With World War Two at its height, and the realities of wartime shortage and risk to life starting to hit the United States, it is heartening to find that people were still able to find warmth and humour in their own desperate situation. The More the Merrier is a charming romantic comedy set amid the lesser-known facets of wartime history on America's home front.The story is woven rather craftily about the realities of the Washington housing shortage and the unexplained yet delightful attempts of an eccentric stranger to bring together a young couple. It's a perfectly balanced screenplay with what is actually a rather small number of scenes, each of which is well-developed enough to move the plot forward in its own way. It shows the signs of having gone through a great many screenwriters ? Robert Russell, Frank Ross, Richard Flournoy, Lewis Foster and Garson Kanin ? each of whom would have had his own strengths and brought his own revisions and refinements. Probably what is best about it is the likability of its characters, in spite of their apparent failings. Joel McCrea is sullen, Jean Arthur snobbish, and Charles Coburn does a great many devious acts, albeit in a good cause. And yet despite these surface flaws, their characters are forgivable and instantly engaging.Of course part of the appeal of these characters is in the way they are brought to life by the cast. It's difficult to talk much about the specifics of each of the three lead performances because what is really marvellous about Arthur, McCrea and Coburn is the way they interact with each other. They have a rapport based on brilliant timing and a real understanding of what their characters are to each other. A lot of the humour comes from their readings of the lines, such as McCrea's brilliantly-timed deadpan delivery in his first scene. From most other actresses, Arthur's wailing at the end would be annoying, but with her it's funny. Coburn is able to turn himself from the bluff old gentleman to something more unconventional, such as when he suddenly joins in with the boys playing at shooting each other. The More the Merrier shows us way of acting that is never exactly typical, but a mix of the realistic and the bizarre. All three of the principle players give what is probably their career best.The director is George Stevens, whose background was in comedy but was moving ever more towards drama. As usual he turns various scenes into a kind of slapstick, usually drawing out normal situations (like the morning schedule) to the point of absurdity, often with a slow pace unusual for physical comedy. Sometimes this is quite funny (such as the time it takes Arthur to realise Coburn is at her window), at others it is a little heavy-handed (Coburn's pants getting caught on a door handle is done in an obvious close-up that makes it less funny than it should be). Where it really pays off though is in the seemingly innocuous lines of dialogue that round off the action. After Coburn's ineptitude has lead to him tipping the coffeepot into his bath, he explains why there is only a tiny dribble left with by blandly stating "There's a war going on, Miss Milligan" ? a line that sounds hilarious after the long-drawn out chaos that has preceded it.But despite his obvious love of slapstick, Stevens's real forte lay in tender, emotional drama, and it is around this time that his style really starts to come of age. There's an incredibly tantalising moment, when we think McCrea and Arthur are going to kiss. Stevens moves the camera in ever so slowly as would be normal cinematic convention, and when the kiss doesn't happen it's all the more jarring. Later we see him using the technique of long-drawn out sequences turned to something more romantic, as the couple sit half-drunk on the steps of the apartment, obviously hopelessly in love with each other but talking as if they're not. Stevens's constant angle changes, barely using the same set-up twice, stop us from seeing the apartment as a conceivable place and focus us entirely upon the people within it.The More the Merrier is a lovely heart-warming picture, and more than any other movie I can think of the good intentions of cast, crew and writers shine through. One gets the feeling that it is at one and the same time both a carefully planned production and one that largely came together on the set ? the situations, the characters, the performance, the way each scene is shot, the witty dialogue ? it seems as if each one has shaped and fed into the other. It is clearly a piece of dedicated teamwork and mutual understanding, and in many ways reflects the wartime spirit better than any other picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good comedy which is a period piece but works very well due to the talents of the cast. Jean Arthur is delightful in this doing the type of comedy she was born to do. Charles Coburn won a Deserved Oscar in support as Mr. Dingle who seems to have his nose into everybody's business.Joel McRea is out of the saddle here. His sequences with Jean Arthur seems to have some real spark and he seems a perfect straight man to her. George Stevens does a fine job handling the cast with support including Grady Sutton who had a much larger support role in The Bank Dick a few years earlier. This is a Columbia Picture which is very well constructed &amp; still holds up are quite amusing.The setting is World War 2 in Washington DC with the actual housing shortage going on. This would be remade later as Walk Don't Run with Cary Grant in Colburns role in the mid 1960's. Both are good pictures though Colburn was not near the end of his career here, where Grant was near it in the later picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Crackle to Cute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half-hour is a triumph of comedic architecture. The screen fairly crackles with madcap antics as Jean Arthur tries to keep an over-crowded national capital from crowding into her bedroom. Coburn may look unthreatening but he's expert at maneuvering. Just listen to him fast-talk his way into her kitchen, her bathroom, and "full speed ahead", where will it stop. Then there's McCrea?an eligible man in a city full of lonely women. He's a definite threat, and if things weren't crowded enough, Coburn has shoe-horned him into what's left. What's a girl to do, living with two men, and engaged to a third. Oh well, it is Washington DC and it is wartime, so stick to the house schedule, and things will work out. Maybe.Of course, they do, but not the way Arthur thinks. No wonder an unheralded 66-year old actor gets an Oscar for his performance. Coburn steals the show with his amusing and crafty Benjamin Dingle. It seems he's always one step ahead of everyone else, whether arranging housing plans or tearing down romantic walls. It's also an Arthur showcase, proving again what an expert comedic actress she was, while McCrea blends in nicely as the handsome straight man. However, once the romantic phase takes over and Coburn fades, the crackle stretches out into the merely cute.Sure, some of the material has lost some of the edge to changing mores. Do single, working women still worry about reputation. For that matter, do men. Nonetheless, that first half-hour remains a gem of timing, scripting and staging, unaffected by passing years. If there was a brighter comedic exercise during those terrible war years, I haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recommend dakota_linda ("Delightful if not quite perfect", dakota_linda from United States, 14 June 2009) and denscul ("A really funny 'war' movie about the housing shortage in Washington", denscul from virginia, 21 January 2007). Both writers express their praise for "The More the Merrier" (TMM) very well.TMM has disappointing story holes. It also has embarrassing racism to Japanese. It isn't first-rate screwball comedy. It has some exceptional ideas, but is dated. TMM comes from an era of movie making where audiences were familiar with screwball comedy conventions; so many shortcuts are taken that confuse us today. An example from the end is the reputation-killing gossip columnist who the other characters believe will do them harm. The modern audience doesn't understand how powerful a gossip columnist was back then, so the characters' desperate response is perplexing.The principal three members of the cast play their parts very well. Cockburn wins the Oscar, but Joel McCrea is even better to me. Jean Arthur also plays the indecisive Connie Milligan exceptionally well. Her character loses control in the last two scenes; certainly she's crying too much for a modern audience to find agreeable.I like how McCrea's Joe Carter is introduced. He's literally carrying a propeller after Coburn's Benjamin Dingle is repeating the "Damn the Torpedoes" mantra. McCrea is introduced to us as the stationary male. In the final scene that dog is loose. That's a beautiful transition, and a little singing makes the ending memorable.The silly sequence where Connie and Joe first meet is one of the film's strengths. The late-game love talk between Joe and Connie (who are separated by a wall) is exquisite. The derogatory references to Japanese are all painful to endure. The FBI involvement is completely naive to a modern audience. All suggestions about government representatives sincerely trying to enact policy on behalf of the public interest is ludicrous today."The More the Merrier" is never laugh-out-loud funny, but is worthwhile despite plot twists that are not conceivable today. It would have been great to have been alive in 1943. Those people lived in a blessed time without realizing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>really bogs down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie started very promising, a fun, funny comedy. But somewhere along the line it lost its way, and became ponderous and gloomy, in a way that didn't really make much sense. Some of the other reviews here have gone into that in detail, and they are spot on right, so I won't go through it again. I will just underscore that I quite agree that it makes no sense that the couple goes through with a "fake" marriage after already having declared their love and desire for a real one. It's just head-scratchingly odd, and not at all enjoyable. Seems like all that was contrived just to make the final scene work, but it really wasn't worth it.Still, Mr. Dingle was a fun character (even if I didn't entirely understand his motivations throughout. Why was he *so* interested in being Mr. Matchmaker?). Conny is rather amusing with her ultra-anal schedule, a side of her which unfortunately isn't really carried through much beyond that scene. There's more to like than dislike in this film. But it doesn't deliver on its initial promise and could've been a whole lot better.I totally agree with the review here that lists a bunch of superior comedies, and I am indebted to that reviewer, because I've never seen some of them and intend to do so (given the high quality of the ones on the list I *have* seen).I can only scratch my head at the reviewers here who gave it 9 or 10 stars and thought it was absolutely hilarious. It wasn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected a much funnier, faster-paced comedy.The leads are wonderful at comedy - Joel McCrea in the humorous parts of say, Foreign Correspondent is great. Charles Coburn is wonderful here. And Jean Arthur is so very deft, her voice capable of such expression.Yet I found much of the movie formulaic (the obligatory trip by everyone to the police station or the courthouse that we saw in dozens of movies from the 1930s: the oaf of a fiancé, the wall or curtain separating those in love as they speak to each other and the camera zooms in, the crowd of unlikely people cheering them on ...).This is very slow, and the romance consists primarily in just putting the two leads together and having them speak s l o w l y while deliberately looking away from each other. Aside from Joel McCrea's looks, for the life of me, I cannot think of a single reason why an engaged woman falls in love with him in a few days. He says virtually nothing, he does virtually nothing. The fiancé must be made oafish in order to show McCrea as the only alternative.The gags are often repeated and belabored too long.The main characters seem to either be silent or speak at half speed through much of the movie.So much of this movie feels stolen - and some doesn't make sense.*** SPOILERS **** Long after McCrea and Arthur have spoken of their love for one another, and McCrea has proposed - why is it that when the oafish fiancé is gone, Arthur and McCrea must pretend for the next 26 hours that their wedding is a mere formality to be followed by annulment? I don't get it at all. It makes no sense. It just seems to be put in there so that the director can AGAIN delay the consummation of their love. But it's idiotic.**** SPOILERS **** I blame George Stevens. The basic plot is fine for a wonderful screwball comedy - but this movie lacks comic flair in direction, lacks the imagination for the small bits that a viewer loves to see in a comedy, and its scenes that run too long.Compare this with, say, the wonderful charming memorable nonsense in breathtaking comedies that had come BEFORE it: e.g., The Awful Truth (from which this movie steals much), Midnight, One Hour With You, Hands Across the Table, It Happened One Night (from which this movie steals much), The Smiling Lieutenant, The Princess Comes Across, His Girl Friday, Dinner at 8:00, Love Me Tonight, Topper, 5th Avenue Girl, The Gay Divorcée, Bachelor Mother, Easy Living, True Confession, Roberta, The Man Who Came to Dinner, Top Hat, Trouble in Paradise, You Can't Take it With You, Private Lives, My Man Godfrey, Bringing Up Baby -- -- and you'll agree that they're all superior. It's a pity because I'd love to have loved this.This is a well-made but ponderous copy of far better comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1940s housing shortage in Washington DC, Constance Milligan (Jean Arthur) decides to take in a boarder to help the war effort. Benjamin Dingle (Charles Coburn) moves in and he, in turn, invites hunky Joe Carter (Joel McCrea) to move in. Complications ensure.It's beyond me why this is considered a classic. It's not a bad movie just an OK movie. It does have lots of things going for it: Arthur is just wonderful--and beautiful; Coburn is a delight (he won an Oscar for this); it's well-directed and some of the romance works.But I never believed the story for one second and I didn't find this that funny at all--I thought most of the jokes fell flat. Arthur and Coburn tried but McCrea (never a good actor) just could not do comedy. He did wonderfully in one scene (his expressions when Colburn introduces him to Arthur are quite funny) but he was his usual expressionless self the rest of the movie. He was handsome and hunky--that was about it. Also the ending was just REALLY going too far. I realize I'm in a minority here but I just thought this was so-so. I can truthfully only give this a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The war-time influx of people Into Washington, D.C., had created a major housing shortage by 1943. As a patriotic gesture Connie (Jean Arthur) advertises a spare room in her apartment. Benjamin Dingle (Charles Coburn), a dignified senior citizen with an appointment with a Senator, has arrived in Washington 2 days early for his hotel reservation. There are no vacancies anywhere. But he spots Connie's ad and boldly tricks the line of other people who answered the ad to leave. Then he talks Connie into subletting half the apartment to him even though she intended to only accept a lady tenant. He then rents half of his half to Joe Carter (the ruggedly handsome Joel McCrea) without telling Connie about it. That is the premise of this situation comedy.I watched this on TCM and think it may have been an abridged version. In one instance the scene switched from the main characters inside the apartment to everyone (not just the main characters but many extras who I suppose were meant to be other residents of the apartment building) enjoining the sun on the roof-top. Also, there possibly was some earlier scene introducing the relationship between Connie and her teenage friend, Morton. In the TCM version there is no set up for the scene where Connie advises Morton to join the Boy Scouts. Morton's character is odd because he talks in the manner of a New York street kid, whereas D.C. at the time was still very much a southern town. Still, the story was not difficult to follow. But in the nearly 70 years since this was an original concept, this kind of story has been copied and adapted into so many comedies that it now seems stale and predictable. Academy Award nominations and winners, particularly in the studio years, have often seem to be based on popularity or advertising, not strictly merit. Charles Coburn won the 16th Academy Awards Best Supporting Oscar for this film, beating (among others) Claude Raines in Casablanca. Inexplicable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definition Of A "Trifling Comedy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The words "trifling comedy" seem somewhat cliché and unhelpful, but having watched "The More The Merrier," they also seem to fit this movie to a "t." In the historical context in which this movie was made (at the height of the Second World War) I'm sure this represented a welcome diversion from the standard war movie or patriotic binge that would have been most common. And yet, despite the high regard in which it's held, it really didn't do a lot for me. I watched it right through, and didn't find it difficult to watch at all. I also didn't find anything here that would make me want to watch it again, though.This movie is cute rather than funny, and sweetly innocent. One shudders to think what Hollywood would do today with this story of two men sharing an apartment with a young woman during a housing shortage! The leads (Jean Arthur as Connie, Joel McCrae as Joe, and Charles Coburn as Mr. Dingle) all give good performances. Coburn himself is quite funny in a few places, and Connie's timetable for keeping order in the apartment is worthy of a few laughs. Aside from that, however, the movie isn't outrageously funny. The story is also quite predictable, and once the lead characters are introduced, there's really never any doubt how this story is going to turn out.I think this is quite over-rated, although worthy of wasting a couple of hours with. 4/10</fullReview>
