		<fullReview>To escape enforced marriage to the hateful Lord Carnal ( Theodore Kosloff ), Lady Jocelyn Leigh ( Betty Compson ) joins her maid on a "bride ship" bound for the American colonies. She is dismayed by the conditions she finds in Virginia, and, for her protection, she marries Capt. Ralph Percy ( Bert Lytell ), whom she comes to love. Meanwhile, Carnal finds Jocelyn and has Percy imprisoned. Percy escapes and rescues Jocelyn from Carnal's departing ship but takes Carnal along in their small boat. The three run into a violent storm and are driven to a pirates' camp. Through Percy's courage they escape but are taken to England, where Carnal again causes Percy's imprisonment and is promised Jocelyn's hand. Percy escapes with the help of Lord Buckingham ( Lucien Littlefield ), defeats Carnal in a duel, and is reunited with Jocelyn.This 1922 silent historical/drama/romance was based from the novel To Have and To Hold by Mary Johnston, produced by the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, starring Betty Compson and Bert Lytell. Tragically this early film adaptation of the popular novel is now considered a lost silent film.</fullReview>
