		<shortDescription>Proves that someone in Hollywood has a screw loose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why would anyone in their right mind want to re-make "Night of the Hunter"(1955), "From Here to Eternity"(1953), or "Vanishing Point"(1971)?And if they felt compelled to remake one of these timeless classics, why would they go out of their way to make it some damn hokey?There is none of the high energy music, devil-may-care attitude of the original in this tepid film about a guy trying to be at his wife's bedside during a difficult child-birth.The original was about SPEED. Kowalski was running because of a bet over a handful of Speed. Speed was the essence and the ultimate high in the original. No big motives. No pre-chewed, silly little plot. And no Christian first name-"Jimmy" fer cryin' out loud!This one is enough to make Paul Koslo (the ORIGINAL young cop) wanna break heads again. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>What made the original Vanishing Point a classic was that everyone was free to read their own meaning into it... or read no meaning at all and just watch the Challenger roar through the desert. What motivates Kowalski? Decipher it from his actions and flashbacks, or just ignore the question entirely. The film is still magnificent either way.But the studio thought this uncertainty made it too esoteric back in 1971, so it was cut and given a limited release in the expectation of a quick death. But far from vanishing, the original Vanishing Point became recognized as one the GREAT road movies of all time.This remake shows that Hollywood hasn't changed much. They love remaking a classic (hopefully guaranteeing an audience), but they still think that everything needs to be made both very obvious and very very simple. So they get rid of all the classic elements and turn it into a generic chase movie. They give Kowalski a really REALLY simple, obvious reason for his drive, making his flashbacks and encounters purely superfluous. And being superfluous they are populated with trite two dimensional caricatures... boring fluff that could be disposed of without diminishing this movie at all, slight though it is. This is entirely unlike the original which had interesting, unusual people that added to the story and gave context to the nature and character of Kowalski.And that clunky, mass market mysticism thrown into the remake? ANY film is better off without that!!!They also decided to make a federal case out of Kowalski's run... literally. It's not enough that state cops will naturally chase people who run from them (as in the original, and assign a symbolic meaning - or not - to that if you wish). In the remake they pound you again and again with a clumsy blunt-object polemic about the government and militias, with the FBI, ATF etc ultimately all ganging up on Kowalski. The people who spawned this remake obviously read their own meanings into the original... that's the quality it has that makes it great. But instead of opening up any meanings we might find in their new version for us to discover ourselves, they forced on us that single reading of theirs alone. Unfortunately, that one narrow focus vastly shrank the appeal of the remake to something less than a vanishing point. The end result wasn't worth the wasting of either the Charger or the Challenger, let alone the both of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the original movie. I knew that the remake couldn't possibly be that good, and that they would make some changes to the story. Still, I thought they would at least capture some of the atmosphere of the original. Uh-uh. They screw up in every turn (for starters, giving the hero a REASON for racing so fast!)! None of the characters are likable, the action is lame, and the ending is mind-boggling awful and manipulative. You should be ashamed of yourself, 20th-Century-Fox!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, dear lord.... They've turned what was a fairly thought provoking movie into a swaggering testosterone fest.The original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our hero Kowalski. He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Fransisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers? We're not really sure.We had a few flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline junkie, and presumably he had led his entire life trying to make it to the vanishing point. That point you see off in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together, and the road itself vanishes. He lives only to be free, and means no ill on anyone. We saw several times when there were accidents he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on, even the cops that were chasing him.When he saw the futility of his quest he took his life rather than be arrested and live a life of captivity. He died like he lived, running wide open.In the remake Kowalski has a whole history (including a first name, even.) He's trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications to her pregnancy. He is a devoted husband, and excited expectant father. He comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife died in delivery, but they even leave THAT in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before it ran into the bulldozers. They even gave the part of "super soul," the blind DJ (brilliantly portrayed by Clevon Little in the original) to JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!? Give me a break.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yuck! And again I say...YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.There was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're right...this guy was no hero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has said about the wonderful, original "Vanishing Point"; I finally got to see the TV remake of the 1970 classic...and it was a shame. The original had Barry Newman, who somehow had the unique talent to come across as a guy who'd 'been there and done that'...and survived it all with wit, humor, and integrity as well as fantastic driving skills. The bozo in this tepid rehash looks like he'd be out of his weight battling a soggy airmail envelope. Most of the time, while driving, he looks as if he's a 12-year-old punk out joyriding his older brother's car...and about to lose control of it, at that.Even the little technical details were goofy beyond reason. "Jimmy" Kowalski managed to buy a police radio scanner, and somehow it doesn't need an antenna to receive signals. Better yet, since it's a crystal-controlled radio, 'magic crystals' cut for the correct radio frequencies used by cops in FOUR STATES somehow magically install themselves during the asphalt festivities. Better yet, the radio doesn't even stop scanning when a transmission is received!!!Kowalski was supposed to be a former Army Ranger, and at one point he's in uniform, in front of a Captain who's dressing him down for his being an 'individual'. He's wearing a pair of army jump-wings, which means he's an Airborne Ranger (I guess), but no Combat Infantry Badge, despite being a decorated combat veteran. Interesting.In short, the numerous flaws of this movie far outweigh its virtues.On the other hand, the southwestern U.S. looked as lovely as it does in real life. Some nice footage of the area's scenic beauty was most welcome.They made the point...several times...during this flick that Kowalski wasn't a hero...just an 'ordinary guy' involved in 'extraordinary events'. Well, the REAL Kowalski (Newman) in the original was an extraordinary guy performing extraordinary feats. The big mistake here was trying to give us too much backstory on the mysterious and intrepid Mr. K, instead of letting us fill in the details ourselves. If you want to see a true American classic...a unique snapshot of early 1970s America, as it were, stay away from this T.V. travesty and watch the original instead. </fullReview>

The atmosphere is gone, the story which tries to explain everything totally demystifies the film. I won't lose a word on the soundtrack ;) And Viggo Mortensen isn't half as cool as Barry Newman. The only reason to watch this movie is the white Challenger. Only that lovely Challenger :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie on TV was just painful.A sham that fed off the legendary film from 1970 that bears the same title.The 1970 Challenger is there (albeit a Hemi this time,and with sport mirrors and quick fill gas cap...not in the 1970 movie)and a lead character named Kowalski but not much else.Lousy acting that was only offset by some fast action chase sequences,and a 1968 Charger named "beast".Implausable getaways,finding a 426 Hemi oilpan in a junkyard (sure....right),and a ridiculous crash at the end (180 mph into dozers and no dents on the "crash" car).Jason Priestly acted like an idiot with an accent (as opposed to Cleavon Little's excellent "hip" portrayal in 1970).His radio station manager was kinda cute but there wasnt much else.....although it was TVs first real glimpse of "La Femme Nikita's" Peta Wilson out in the desert.I dont know whatever happened to Barry Newman's (1970 Kowalski) plans to remake VP before this travesty (he was planning to buy the movie rights and do a back story into Kowalski's past life),but you can bet he has now washed his hands of any further VP comebacks thanks to FOXs coffin-nailing finale to the cult classic.Hopefully they wont ever release this on VHS/DVD.If you missed it,thank your lucky stars you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just plain bad. Sometimes remakes, even if they stray from the original, are good on their own. They can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. This was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be. This wasn't any good even standing on it's own. Viggo Mortenson is a top-notch actor, but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired. The original "Vanishing Point" was such a thrilling, psychological adventure; this is not an adventure at all, and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever. This was made from a by-the-numbers approach to film-making, stuffing in plot points that someone in Hollywood believes will please what they see as today's film-going audience. Basically, they see us as a bunch of idiots. It's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film, and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily. The manipulative plot devices, the "make-it-obvious-so-they-don't-miss-the-point" aspects, ridiculous dialogue, stereotyped characters, amateurish direction...This is plain bad....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original, i suppose. Which is really sad, because at a deeper level, the title 'Vanishing Point' the original, is so ironic. I'm sure it wasn't intended that way, but the original was filmed in 1970, and released in 1971. The REAL 'VANISHING POINT' was the end of an era, which pretty much ended in the early 1970s. In this remake, all the counter-cultural elements have been stripped away, and been rendered more PC in an attempt to reach a broader audience, presumably. "Sanitized for your Protection" Inserting the American Indian scenes was gratuitous, and the idea of a 'noble purpose' to the trip was subtraction by addition. I'm glad I watched it however, it made me appreciate the original that much more. The original is a cult classic and golden. This remake is dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrible remake of a marginal, but well liked, movie from the early 70's. I have seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20 minute movie 'crammed' into 2 hours or whatever the runtime is. Cheesy storyline, which by the way, is completely different than the original. The major government involvement was far-fetched. There is no flow from one scene to the next. In the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up. It only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car. It takes many times longer than that in real life. Car guys notice this stuff. Also, the fool or fools that chose to trash a 1968 Charger and abuse a 1970 Challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet. The fact they aren't 'car people' is painfully obvious, and their passing will not be grieved. The actors lacked any emotion, everything was cut and dried. One step above a monotone. A barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic.Last but surely not least, the radio DJ made the statement that the Challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). That is total garbage. Can you say aerodynamics, or lack thereof?? Hahahaha!! This movie is a joke. Don't waste your time watching this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by stating that I have not seen the original 1971 "Vanishing Point", yet. I only picked this movie up from the library because the title stood out after I had remembered it mentioned several times in "Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof", and it was the only copy there. No original. So I took a look.First off the whole religion/spirituality theme underlying the whole movie was very unnecessary and forced. Several people are seen performing the signs of the cross, Kowalski's conversion to Catholicism is very prevalent, and even the doctor he contacts at the hospital his wife is at, is named Nazren. Sounds a lot like Nazarene or Nazareth. So the whole religious side of the film was unnecessary.The Flashback/Dream sequences were edited very poorly. It takes a second before you realize it's really a flashback/dream because they are edited into the current scene like it's similar scene or parallel moment somewhere else.And finally the action. I love car chases in film. Movies like Death Proof and Gone in 60 Seconds have amazing car chases, with lots of crashes, side by side collisions, all the fun stuff. This film has some decent car chase sequences but they are split apart too many times to make way for the drama that it really tarnishes the adrenaline rush they should be evoking. Not only that but they are not spectacular. The first few are a bit of a rush because you he has his "mission" and he means to fulfill it. But after a while, with all the stops and drama, the action not only feels less engaging or tense but the action itself feels a little tired, as in the stunts and speedy feeling become less and less powerful and amazing.The story was simple but with all the "hero" messages and religion "advertising" it started to feel too contrived and mixed up. Finish it off with a poorly written and COMPLETELY unnecessarily ambiguous ending and you get 1997 "Vanishing Point".Again I have not seen the original (something I will get on top of ASAP), so I can't decided for myself how it holds up but my experience with this film has strengthened my powers of clairvoyance and they say: "It doesn't..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Should Vanish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Vanishing Point" was a great flick. Subtle motives, characters that seemed real and spontaneous.The remake was terrible. Preachy, overtly obvious; it missed the point as to why the original was a classic. The black Charger was cool, but even that couldn't rescue this flick. Why stick with a white Challenger? I didn't think that was the best choice back in '71. Some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious. Like when Vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his "Dream Quest". His Indian pal was standing next to him. Vigo was only wearing his white briefs. I'm sorry - it just looked silly - him surveying the vista in his Fruit of the Looms. Another scene was at the end - after the explosive crash into the bulldosers - the announcer said that the impact was clocked at 180 mph. Then he mentions that the cops said his remains weren't found because he vaporized, but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd. Then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph! First of all, you couldn't open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly, the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds. with nobody to steer it. It would promptly roll over about 30 times. Thirdly, if you hit the pavement at 180 mph, you would wind up in various squishy pieces. No matter, we see him at the end standing with his daughter. All in all, a movie that would insult anyone's intelligence.</fullReview>

I AM glad that Aragorn wasn't typecast as an expectant psycho by this P.O.S. Go back and watch the 1971 version, count the things that would NEVER be included in a modern version, and thank whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that wasn't based on someone else's ideas, and wasn't passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta admit that I've never seen the original "Vanishing point" (1971) - at least right now I have no recollection of it. Therefore I unfortunately can't compare the two and it's naturally pretty much impossible for me to estimate if this is good or bad film only as a remake. Still I have the courage to assume that this new version is just a pale shadow of the original 70's classic. If you want to see one practically an endless car chase you'll get it from here too but wild speeding and charisma of Viggo Mortensen can't keep a movie together too long if it's all the film has to offer. I watched "Vanishing point" all the way through and it had some entertaining and enjoyable scenes here and there. If you're looking for a simple, brisk action movie with lots of police cars, dusty road and a chance to marvel Mortensen's bushy sideburns this is all you need. But the plot sounded so great I honestly expected something bit more exciting. If I ever get a chance to see the original I would very gladly check it out. It would be quite interesting to find out if it's any better than this and how much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as good as you can expect from a made-for-TV remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But even then, "Vanishing Point" is exceedingly uninvolving and surprisingly ill-advised in its selective updating. If you're updating Kowalski from Vietnam to Desert Storm, then why is he still driving the same (now-26-year-old) Challenger? Referring to the police as "The Man" meant something in the countercultural original. Here, not so much. If you change a few key elements - the main character's name, his ride, different movie title - then you might have something: a guy who's trying to get home to his wife who's in labor. Work that out, and you might have something to hang a movie on. But watching this movie, and knowing that it's somehow connected to the original "Vanishing Point" [1971] just dooms it from the start. It's got no drive, no ambition. The original movie was greater than the sum of its parts, but the remake relies only on the iconic car and some superficial connections. Just an extremely generic and boring affair.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fans of the original were always going to hate this remake but even the casual viewer will not find a great deal to enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a pregnant wife and very little money in the bank, former Ranger and race driver, James Kowalski needs cash to pay for a hospital place during labour. He is on a job several states away when he learns his wife has gone into a dangerous labour and sets off a full speed to get home to his wife. Pulled over early on his journey, Kowalski makes a break for it and manages to evade the police across a couple of states. However as talk radio pick up on this "outlaw hero", his profile rises and he draws the attention of an equally gung-ho cop and the power of those not bound by state boundaries. Meanwhile Kowalski tries to focus on his wife and future child.There is no doubt that the producers of this remake never expected to win any friends among those who consider the original Vanishing Point to be a classic cult film. I am not one of those people but I can understand why they would hate this film because it loses whatever strange appeal the original had and replaces it with more story but nothing really that good. The casual viewer may appreciate the more meaningful plot here but really it doesn't make it a better film ? just a better structured one. With more of a plot, the remake could have done something different by making this more of a character-driven story or at least, although clichéd, made more out of the relationship between Kowalski and his pursuers or even made comments about the little man versus the Man. Instead what it does is produce a simple story where Kowalski meets people along the road in between car chases.If you want an idea of what you're getting into, if they had added a few laughs here and there then this could easily have been Smokey &amp; The Bandit 5. The car chases lack any imagination or special effort and, although noisy, are certainly not anywhere near special enough to justify essentially building a film around them. The whole thing smacks of television movie budgets but I suppose for some people this is enough for them ? some people just like to see cars drive fast and crash (and before you accuse me of being a snob, please remember that I actually bothered to watch this film). The cast don't really help although, looking back, Mortensen looks like an attraction. Sadly he isn't because he plays the role right down the middle and didn't emotionally engage me or produce anything else of interest. Like the film itself, he more or less does what he was asked to do and isn't bad but certainly isn't any good. The same goes for the rest of the cast and the only distraction was the presence of familiar faces like David and Priestly.Overall, if you like the original then you will rip at your hair all the way though this because it simply doesn't compare (and remember when I say this that I didn't really like the original all that much). If you have never seen the original or even heard of it then you're still not off the hook because this is a simple, basic affair that relies on cardboard characters, a join-the-dots plot and lots of average car chases that are noisy but lack excitement. Not really worth it all round.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't add much to the comments already made to bash this terrible remake. Lousy at every turn, from plot to script to casting. With Jason Priestley and Christine Elise, both from 90210, why didn't they just toss Brian Austin Green into the driver's seat as Kowalski? Luke Perry could have been the antagonistic Charger-driving cop, and when all was said and done, Shannen Doherty would still have been glad to have left this sorry troupe of yo-yos behind. A mindless waste of time and money- a prime example of everything wrong with the Hollywood system. Simply stupid. Next up- Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer bring you Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera in the high-octane remake of 'Dirty Mary Crazy Larry'...the story of a budding NASCAR wanna-be and a hooker that steal Wal-Mart's money to pay for his mother's alzheimer's treatments.

		<fullReview>Any movie that shows federal PIGs (Persons In Government) to be the power-mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me.Alas, the script supervision and editing and even, at times, the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments.I saw the original way back when it was new and hated it, despised it, loathed it. Thought it was a terrible, irrational piece of junk.Now, though, I don't remember why.I believe the two should not be compared or even connected.Consider them as two different movies.Rate them as two different movies.This "Vanishing Point" provides a rallying place, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is, especially the federal government."The Voice" wears a cap bearing the state motto of New Hampshire: "Live Free or Die." At one time it would have been the motto of most Americans.Despite its obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is a film to cheer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning. As an example, Bonnie and Clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds. Why? They were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive.This film has absolutely no substance. The Viggo Mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero. Why? He speeds along an Idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking. No one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone. Even worse, when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red-neck terrorist, no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends.Jason Priestley co-stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of our hero.The ending is absolutely unbelievable.</fullReview>

I haven't seen the original so i cannot say if this was better or worse but from what i have seen with this movie the original must of been good !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's get real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Come on. Utah is known as the Bee Hive State. In the beginning, you show a license plate that shoes it as the "Monument Valley State"?????? How phony can you get?? And One of the plates actually shows "Delicate Arch" in Arches National Park. Why couldn't you do something real about THAT????? Your boys need to do a lot more research for the rest of your movies. As far as the rest of the movie. Not bad. Viggo did an excellent job in the role. I believe you could have done a lot more into why he had to go all the way into Arizona and then into Utah. The original movie did have many more "different" types of characters. For example: What happened to the black radio announcer, and what happened to the "snake" people in the middle of the desert. My opinion is that the plot should have had more of the eccentrics that were involved in the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exciting; a little more than just a car chase movie (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of the movie, barricades are being set up at an Idaho railroad bridge, and protesters on both sides of an issue are being held back by some of the numerous cops on the scene. Even more cops are arriving in a sea of blue and red lights. Finally, we see the white car.Then we back up to a week earlier. Jimmy Kowalski is worried about his pregnant wife, who is about to deliver, and there are potential problems that make him reluctant to leave his Idaho home to make a delivery to New Mexico. His wife assures him everything will be all right, and he goes to New Mexico anyway. Once there, he has to bring back a white 1970 Dodge Challenger--not just a car, but the ultimate muscle car. After telephoning to check on his wife, Kowalski finds out there were problems and his wife has been taken to the hospital. He heads for home as fast as he can make that car go, but gets pulled over by cops who rough him up--just as he was roughed up years ago. Apparently Kowalski has a past, because the same thing happens in one of the numerous flashbacks, though the past is explained later by someone who knows about what happened. Kowalski escapes and leads the cops on the first of what will be many exciting chases. Later, the problem is not just that Kowalski was speeding. Since he comes from Idaho, where there have been white supremacist groups, he is suspected of being another Timothy McVeigh, carrying explosives or something else that will lead to the next major terrorist attack. On his side is a radio DJ known as 'The Voice' who is strongly opposed to government interference in people's lives, and is not afraid to speak his opinions. As Kowalski drives all over the West with the help of numerous quirky characters, he alternates between 'The Voice' and a police scanner he gets in order to stay one step ahead of the cops. (I have to believe Voice's radio station has one of the most powerful FM signals in the whole country, because no matter where he goes, Kowalski never seems to be out of range.) Eventually, as Kowalski becomes a celebrity thanks to CNN, callers from around the country phone in their opinions to 'The Voice', including people who know Kowalski and his situation and don't believe he is anything but a speeder. Still, he has an overzealous Utah state trooper and his goofy partner on his tail, not to mention a determined FBI agent who does not want to be embarrassed.The movie gains some significance when Kowalski meets up with a group of Native Americans who watch TV and know what is happening. Having been the victim of federal government persecution themselves, they are willing to help, and they also teach him lessons about nature. The flashback where he meets his wife as they rescue a mountain lion has more meaning when the Indians explain that the lion was here first. Other flashbacks show his relationship with his wife progressing, including his baptism (he wasn't religious but she was) and his wedding. He is also shown receiving a medal for Desert Storm; this has some meaning because one of those who helps Kowalski respects him for his war service, but it didn't seem necessary.I liked this movie overall. Some of the characters were funny even though this wasn't supposed to be a comedy, and there was lots of exciting chase action.Possible Spoiler: I loved it when Kowalski, having figured out that he was being tracked by his cell phone use, put the phone on a bus, and the FBI agent ended up being made to look like a fool when the bus was stopped and the phone was found in the luggage compartment.********************SPOILERS******************** I found the ending very disappointing and wish it could have somehow been handled differently. In a way, a happy ending was possible, but the way it happened makes no sense. It is suggested that there never was a pregnant wife and that Kowalski imagined the whole thing, wishing that his wife had not died when she was pregnant at some point in the past. But there was too much evidence the wife was real and I just don't understand why it had to be done that way. The writers gave themselves an escape but didn't use it. And the crazy theory from 'The Voice' on how the movie ended: well, that's just impossible, though it would have made for a happy ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vanishing Point (1997)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, I loved Vanishing Point. I've seen the original, and this is a pretty good remake of it. Even though it didn't follow the original storyline (that's why I gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline.As for the car, well the DJ's comment at the end about the Challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable (And if you look, the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145-150), but even though I didn't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine, the original storyline had a supercharged Hemi, so it's possible. For those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it, the normally aspirated Chrysler 300C of today can go 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. Plus, in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the Challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never would have guessed it was made for television.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGH: I really am in the minority on this one but I liked this movie. It's not a classic but it's definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride. I definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating.Perhaps the reason I liked it is because I haven't seen the original.Something tells me that with a movie like this it's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus, have little to compare it to. This was not a masterpiece but I did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original.There were a few things I liked about it. One was the casting of Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. Since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders, he really needed to be excellent and he was. This was a great role for him.Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it's made for television. I had no idea this was the case when watching it. It sure seemed like a major motion picture and I would never have guessed this was not a big screen release.I also found the story to be very absorbing. I'm not one for action movies but I got sucked into this. Plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama, mysticism, a love story, quirky people every which way you turned. (I didn't even recognize Priestly.) And it was touching. This was not a great movie but it is watchable.And then there's the ending. It packs a strong punch and if one's been involved in the story up to that point, it's very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end. I am not sure how I feel about the ending. The implication was that Kowalkski survived and though I'm highly skeptical of HOW that would be possible, it is a movie and realism isn't an ingredient that's always in the mix when making a movie.So I'd have to say I found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way, which I don't usually like but for some reason, is almost forgivable in this movie. Admittedly, a lot of things were just props for the plot(could the villains have been anymore stereotypical?) But the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well. However, having said that, I will admit I can understand why someone who's a major fan of the original would hate this version because, though I have not seen the original, I have seen many original movies I loved being remade with terrible results. (My big dislike is actually sequels.) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality.People have compared this to Smoky and the Bandit. How about a road version of "Legends Of The Fall" meets "Thelma and Louese" as well? I sure felt touches of both films(both of which I'm a fan of.) I do not think however, that this was a great film. It was better then average to me but far from great. But it was an absorbing, adrenalin fueled, touching movie with excellent casting of the main character. My vote is 7 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good TV cheese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny, but at least the filmmakers didn't try. While most TV movies border on the brink of mediocrity, this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it. The cinematography was pretty good for a TV film, and Viggo Mortensen displays shades of Aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules. Most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. I was kind of annoyed by Jason Priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock-jock, but then again, it's a TV MOVIE! Despite all of the good things, the soundtrack was atrocious. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona prominently featured in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure this was a remake of a 70's film, but it had the suspense and action of a current film, say Breakdown. He's running, desperate to be with his hospitalized wife, the police are the least concern. The chases were very good, the part with him beingcornered at a rest stop was well done, the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger. This is better than Bullitt, a boring movie with what, a muscle car chase that was filmed badly? Vigo's character knew what he had to do to escape Johnny Law, few movies had the effects-night vision, CB radio-okay I forgot the name of the movie, guy has 76'Caddy souped up, toys with guy he upset. The ending is great, you can't tell if he fakes his suicide or not, a very good did-he-make-it-or-not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scene opens with two bulldozer forming a "V" roadblock on a secluded Idaho highway. Then, from over a hill in the road, we first see a white 1970 Dodge Challenger hurtling down the road pursued by 4 HighWay Patrol cars...This scene give me chills, and is a welcome sight after a 30 year hiatus. As far as TV movies go, this is an OUTSTANDING movie. Viggo Mortensen aptly portrays Kowalski as a deeply concerned husband trying desperately to get home to his ailing wife. The "Bad Guys" are played to the hilt by veterans Steve Railsback and Keith David, who is the epitome of a sneering antagonist. The flaws are few and far between, with the most notable (maybe) being the fact that this movie has commercials in it! But seriously, some of the editing is below par and at one point an Extra almost runs right into Viggo Mortensen. Neither of these affect the viewers pleasure. The cars are still beautiful. The surprise is a 1968 Dodge Charger R/T that closely resembles (and thus gives a nod to) the one from the classic film Bullitt. The 1997 Kowalski's Challenger is identical to the 1971 Kowalski's except that the "new" Challenger is a 426 Hemi as opposed to a 440 Magnum. When it's all said and done , this is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The US Government Vs One Single Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off with, since this movie is a remake of a classic, the rating has to be lowered already. Since this version stars Viggo Mortensen in the lead role of Kowalski, it helps.Isn't this just like the United States government though, to terrorize one of its own citizens. Sounds like Jason Priestley's character from the movie! But it is the truth, the government would do anything possible to destroy a man's life for trying to get home to his wife. A wife, who is in labor no less, and may not make it."There was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife." The words of the Disc Jockey.There were some great shots of scenery in this film, and great car chases and a lot of spirituality. After much consideration, I gave this film a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give this movie a chance...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this was a made for TV Movie, I've seen lots of them. This movie is all right. Not the greatest one, but very watchable to say the least. Trying to be by your wife's side when she goes into labor is grueling, but when total misunderstanding goes around, a media circus has erupted. Jimmy Kowalski(Viggo Mortensen) goes out on a race to see the birth of his first child. The state police and the FBI end up being on his tail when the chase starts. The FBI wants him bad. For what? Jimmy admits his innocence. Accusing him of being a right-wing militia man? I DON'T THINK SO! When he had that blowout, the snake handler helps him out with the rattler. And these other tribesmen let him expand his mind on life and help him elude the law. And that handshake was awesome. After that, his oil pan ruptures and he sees a woman on a motorcycle wearing a bikini top. He says, "Are you insane?" when he sees her like that. She asks the same thing. Looks who's talk now. The good news that he got to be with his daughter, the bad news that his wife dies while he gets to her. Either way or the other, one way leads to another, and it's not worth killing yourself after the spouse passes. He was the real good guy, the bad guys were the FBI. And this movie here is OK to watch, could have used a little more work done to it, but Oh Well. Rating 2 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a lot more then a cross country car chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you saw the 1971 movie, you will notice the movie makes a social statement. A lot has changed since then. This movie sticks to that point. Unlike Barry Newman, Viggo Mortensen has a good reason for out running John Q. Law. I often said that 'Thelma and Louise' made me think of (the 1971) 'Vanishing Point' not only because of the chases, but they were ordinary people put in an extraordinary circumstances. Here, the 1971 plot is there, just updated. You have the radio D.J. helping Kowalski, the desert rat, the lady on the motorcycle, though not nude (after all, this is a t.v. movie). The trouble is, if you watch the 1971 version, it is really dated. This one deals with the social climate of the 1990s. Sure, Viggo Mortensen is no Barry Newman, and Kowalski now has a first name, but I think this one stands up well on it's own, although I'll say the ending was a cop-out. Me speaking as a car buff, I cried when the wrecked the Charger</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely an appropriate update for the original, except that "party on the left is now party on the right." Like the original, this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty. It is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous, and over-powerful federal government. Kowalski serves as a metaphor for Waco and Ruby Ridge, where the US government, with the cooperation of the mainstream media, threw around words like "white supremacist" and "right wing extremists as well as trumped-up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights, with the willing acquiescence of the general populace. That message is so non-PC, I am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the Federal government via the IRS down on the makers like they did to Juanita Broderick, Katherine Prudhomme, the Western Journalism Center, and countless others who dared to speak out. "Live Free or Die" is the motto on Jason Priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays "the voice," and that sums up the dangerous (to some) message of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really liked this version best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' as opposed to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times(as I did with the 1971 version) than to me, it is not all that great. Of course, this could be due to the fact that I was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out. However, I have seen many remakes, where I have liked the original and older one better. I found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn't so "blase".(Boring)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the original Vanishing Point movie (Barry Neuman as Kowalski) and this for-tv remake. The remake is far more credible as to plot, special effects, but the acting is equally shallow. The remake does a much better job of denoting flashback segments and the car chase segments are just as enjoyable as in the original. The storyline was updated for the remake, includes air bags, stop-sticks, cell phones, nightvision goggles, and references to The Gulf War. Both films are worth the time, but I favor the remake.</fullReview>

In the end, i think he goes faster than any other Challenger I've ever seen, and his is BONE STOCK! When he gets chased by the cops, you want to be in the driver's seat. And don't get me wrong, that cop's Dodge Charger with the Hemi is BAD-ASS too. People, see this flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both Versions Suck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of both the 1971 version and the 1997 TV-remake seem the same; a guy with a fast car leads police on a long-distance chase driving through the Rocky Mountains on a fight against "the man." In the first one, Barry Newman is a speed-addicted driveaway man hired to take the car from Denver to San Francisco, who intends to do so in merely 15 hours. The remake has Luke Perry racing cross-country to get some experimental medicine for his ailing wife and child. In the original, his sympathizers are mostly left-wing radicals, and in the remake they're right-wing radicals. In both versions they're cheered on by local disc jockeys who make heroes out of them. Both Cleavon Little and Jason Priestly present their respected heroes as a backlash against what they hate about the modern world. And both versions are complete pieces of garbage. I remember reading about the original and how it was praised as an anti-establishment cult-classic, but after I rented it I found it lame, incoherent, and utterly mind-numbing. Ditto for the FOX remake. So what if the central characters each drive a cool Dodge Challenger? Cool cars don't always make cool movies, and neither do road trip movies. In my review of ROAD TRIP(2000), I mentioned that shooting a movie on the road is no guarantee of success or quality, and this as well as it's original version are two prime examples.The only reason I can think of to see this movie is to make comparative notes with the original and vice-versa. Other than that, forget it.</fullReview>
