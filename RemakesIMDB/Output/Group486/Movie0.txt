		<shortDescription>A Dirge For A Dying America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Sarafian's 1971 film "Vanishing Point" is, for starters, a fascinating study of those persons anthropologists sometimes term "marginal men"--individuals caught between two powerful and competing cultures, sharing some important aspects of both but not a true part of either, and, as such, remain tragically confined to an often-painful existential loneliness. Inhabiting a sort of twilight zone between "here" and "there," a sort of peculiar purgatory, these restless specters cannot find any peace or place, so they instead instinctively press madly on to some obscure and unknown destination, the relentless journey itself being the only reason and justification. Disc jockey Super Soul (Cleavon Little) and delivery driver Kowalski (Barry Newman) are two of these specters, marginal but decent, intelligent men who can't or won't live in burgeoning competing cultures which in reality have offered them very little of worth or substance, despite their own personal sacrifices. Kowalski himself had tried to "fit in" with the Establishment as a soldier and police officer and later, attempted to do the same with the blossoming 1960s counterculture, but soon disappointingly found that they both were ridden with their own various forms of dishonesty and insincerity. Personal honor, self-reliance and genuine respect--Kowalski's stock in trade--were tragically valued very little by either, despite each one's shrill and haughty claims to the contrary. Moreover, it's no accident Newman's character has a Polish surname; the Poles throughout their history have created a very rich and unique Slavic culture largely based upon just such a "marginality"--being geographically jammed between powerful historic enemies, Germany and Russia, and never being able to fully identify with either one, at often great cost to themselves. It's also no accident Little's character is blind and black, the only one of his kind in a small, all-Caucasian western desert town--his sightlessness enhancing his persuasiveness and his ability to read Kowalski's mind, the radio microphone his voice, his race being the focus of long simmering and later suddenly explosive disdain--all of the characteristics of a far-seeing prophet unjustly (but typically) dishonored in his own land. The desert environment also plays a key role in cementing the personal relationship between and respective fates of these two men--to paraphrase British novelist J.G. Ballard, prophets throughout our history have emerged from deserts of some sort since deserts have, in a sense, exhausted their own futures (like Kowalski himself had already done) and thus are free of the concepts of time and existence as we have conventionally known them (as Super Soul instinctively knew, thus creating his own psychic link to the doomed driver.) Everything is somehow possible, and yet, somehow nothing is. Finally, VP is also a "fin de siecle" story, a unique requiem for a quickly dying age- a now all-but-disappeared one of truly open roads, endless speed for the joy of speed's sake, of big, solid no-nonsense muscle cars, of taking radical chances, of living on the edge in a colorful world of endless possibility, seasoned with a large number and wide variety of all sorts of unusual characters, all of which had long made the USA a wonderful place--and sadly is no longer, having been supplanted by today's swarms of sadistic, military-weaponed cop-thugs, obsessive and intrusive safety freaks, soulless toll plazas, smug yuppie SUV drivers, tedious carbon-copy latte towns, and a childish craving for perfect, high-fuel-efficiency safety and security. The just-issued DVD contains both the US and UK releases of the film; the UK release, I believe, is a much more satisfying film, as it has the original scenes deleted from the US version. As an aside, Super Soul's radio station call letters, KOW, are in fact the ones for a country &amp; western station in San Diego.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barry Newman is "Kowalski", an enigmatic figure who has tried everything in his life from stock car racing to the military, and failed at every one of his endeavors. Working as an auto delivery man, he gets an order to transport a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T to San Francisco, and makes a bet with a few friends that it can be done in an impossibly short time. After loading up on "ups" and throttling the car westward, he is soon pursued vigorously by the police and embraced by the public as something of a hero. During a time when national speed limits were all controversy, this film provides a compelling argument against them: A fast car in the hands of a capable driver is not dangerous. Even the police, so caught up in their own system, don't realize that they are the only ones causing accidents and endangering the public while blindly trying to keep up with and capture Kowalski.While the film sounds at first to be a simple action film, it's really much more than that. Kowalksi's past is revealed little by little through flashbacks, making the film something of a character study. Kowalski's trip becomes a road trip of existentialism as he runs across various strange characters: Solitary hippies, gay bandits, a boogie-woogie snake handling Christian cult, and the blind soul station DJ (brilliantly played by Cleavon Little) who is attempting to guide him on his journey from within the car's radio.Topping it off is a great soundtrack, breathtaking cinematography and direction, and automotive action that has seen no equal. This film manages to be both compelling and exciting. Just watch it already.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kowalski transports cars across the western US in 1970. He gets a gig transporting a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T from Denver to San Francisco and sets out at maximum warp, stopping only for gas and strategy. He commits no crime outside of speeding, and fleeing the cops who are trying to stop him simply because he will not stop. He finds allies along the way, including an old prospector, a DJ named Super Soul, and a hippie who seems to me to be an alternate ending to the life of Peter Fonda's character Wyatt in "Easy Rider". He drives and drives and drives until he meets his destiny in a tiny town on the California-Nevada border at 10:04 AM on some unnamed Sunday.Why? Is it because of his past; ex-cop, ex-racer, tragically bereaved? Is it because of the truckload of speed he takes at the beginning of the movie (draw your own metaphors between Kowalski's internal use of the noun and external use of the verb)?Or is it the road, the infinite expanses of the Southwest, the silence, the freedom, the sound of the motor surging, the tires spinning, the wheels gobbling up and sitting out the black asphalt? Who knows? Kowalski seems indifferent as to why he drives, only that he must drive, must evade, must get to where he is going and will not - can not - be stopped.Do yourself a favor. Rent the original, don't see the '97 made for TV movie (it has some high points, but it's like watching the '99 "Psycho" before seeing the Alfred Hitchcock original). In fact, rent this and "Two Lane Blacktop" from Monte Hellman, and "Mad Max" and/or "The Road Warrior". Watch all of them in as close to one sitting as you can get.If after watching these movies, you don't understand how they're expressions of the same call to the open road, return them and give up. Not everyone was meant to hear it, just like not everyone has perfect pitch or the ability to wiggle their ears.This movie drove me (pun intended) to take the handle kowalski and buy a Challenger of my own (flame red, 1973, you see the 1970 R/Ts are very hard to get).It probably won't do the same for you, but if you've ever been driving down the open road and wondered what would happen if you _didn't_ get off at the next exchange, in fact if you never got off at all, then this film is for you.And I hope the next ignoramus who compares this masterful film to "The Dukes of Hazzard" loses his brakes and plows into a line of parked Harleys outside some bar with a name like Whiskey Junction or the Dew Drop Inn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best carmovie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing I realised about carfilms, or whatever you might call them, is that a certain degree of monotony is always required (check out the wonderful Two Lane Blacktop too see what I mean). If you waste too much time with backgrounds, character development, story etc the really important stuff starts lacking (the car as an instrument of freedom, the road, the desert...). In this way Vanishing Point is the perfect carmovie: it's about the most monotonous, yet beautiful things i've ever seen! It's about:1. The car2. The road3. The desert4. The musicAnd nothing else! Some vague attempts are made to make a character out of Kowalski, but fortunely they're small in numbers. The car is the true main character of the film.I recommend this film with all my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best road movie ever made. To appreciate it you have got to try and see it from the culture of that era. It is totally anti establishment as was the mood of half of America. So the police are all idiots, the 'good ol boys' are either violent rednecks or passive disapproving onlookers. Kowalski is going to give those mid west conservatives something they won't forget, he's going to shake things up for a day or two. Kowalski is simply the symbol of the many disenfranchised at the time. The story starts at the end. We hear a boring stifling radio news item on the price of grain. We see dreary looking bystanders who need to be turned on. Then Super Soul takes over the airwaves with his wild DJ antics and hippy music trying to jolt these people out of their fixed ways. The old and the new are clashing. This sets the mood we know from then it is rebellious. Other aspects the stunts the music the characters have been well covered below so there is no need to say more on that. Some have said that there is no point to this story or Kowalski's motives and have interpreted the title meaning that. But all a vanishing point is an artist name for the phenomena of perspective where two parallel lines seemingly meet and in the long straight roads of the journey we see plenty of vanishing points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gosh, I had forgotten how powerful this is.Seeing it again is a real lesson on how certain cinematic language, if presented purely, transcends. And for a US-made movie, it is pretty pure.If you do not know it, the primary narrative is essentially no narrative: a muscle car speeding across the desert chased by police, initially for speeding and ultimately just to exert power. This fellow is Kowalski, a name imported from a landmark film. He simply drives. It is his life now. We see flashbacks. Find he was a Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, a star racer and then a cop. There's a backstory about his being a good cop and turning in some rotten apples, so by degrees we come to understand the moral landscape.There is only one other character, a blind black disk jockey who is listened to by apparently everyone. Guided by his eavesdropping on police radio, and some psychic ability.This was after "Easy Rider" and instead of bold men moving into a life, we have life chasing an honest man. Same ethic, could even have been the same man. But he knows himself. He knows he is a cinematic creature, someone to be observed and dreamed about. He knows he carries his world with him. Always borrowed. You can see Malick here, the notion that the character sees us seeing him, that he knows he is fictional and knows we think him not. You can trace it to the female version in "Thelma and Louise," where they have their end only because they know someone will watch. Its not like "Cool Hand Luke," or "Bonnie and Clyde" at all where the man decides. That comes from the Hollywood western.Its derived from the "Breathless" tradition. A good third of this film is spent on the "audience," the rural townspeople. These parts are filmed in a documentary style, with ? it seems ? real people who have come to watch the filming, having heard on the radio from a borrowed soul. They look dumb and bored, clearly with nothing better to do than watch, just like us.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barry Newman is perfect in an episodic movie about an ex-cop, now drifter/car ferryman, who takes a friend up on a timed race from Denver to San Francisco in somebody else's car. Once Newman is detected speeding, a lengthy car chase ensues that covers several states. Nice photography of the Open West; great, understated performance by Newman. Some of the movie is dated, and the blind-DJ subplot can be annoying, but the non-stop action makes up for it. Infrequent showings on TV for many years, so watch it or tape it on one of it's rare appearances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the plot summary covers the story and yes! there is a story wrapped around one long car chase. the speed is real, the NOISE is real, that Challenger leaves black lines on the road........ I saw it when it was first released (when I was young and silly) and then spent 15 years trying to track down a Video copy of the movie (made more difficult as it had to be a PAL copy). I got the video in the '90s and still watch this amazing film. People rave about the chase sequence in Bullitt or The French Connection. Vanishing Point takes that excitement and extends it. Simply a great car movie for those who like a great car movie.... watch it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An appropriate movie for the era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Alert More'n a few reviewers on IMDB have described Vanishing Point as being plotless and directionless.... They left out nihilistic and bleak.But that seems to have been a theme during the late '60s and early '70s. Yes, Kowalski dies at the end (commits suicide, really). Just like the car going into the train at the end of 'Dirty Mary &amp; Crazy Larry', or whatshisname getting blown off his motorcycle with a shotgun at the end of 'Easy Rider', or the lone survivor from 'Night of the Living Dead' being killed by cops at the end.... It doesn't matter what you've accomplished, what you've survived through, or how good of a person you are: odds are you'll be offed by a complete stranger for no damn reason, out of the blue. I will leave the parallels between this type of nihilistic thinking and the emotions surrounding a certain military conflict the United States was involved with at the time up to the individual.Um, anyway, about the movie. Hell yes I liked it. The Mopar muscle-cars of the era really were top of the line... I've never had a chance to own a Charger, but I've gone through various muscle cars from the Detroit Big Three, and the 1970 Plymouth I owned was by far the most satisfying for both speed and as a daily driver. Also like Kowalski, I have been driven slowly nuts by way of too little sleep and too much time isolated, living behind the wheel of a car, rarely having conversations with other human beings longer that 45 seconds... Stop to eat, and you realize your back hurts sitting in a 'normal' chair and your feet are out in front of you, poised above imaginary pedals.The bet at the beginning of the movie --- what constitutes the basis for the 'plot' --- is absolute insanity: Driving from Denver to San Francisco in fifteen hours. This works out to averaging 100 m.p.h., not including stopping for fuel. (I've taken bets like this on a smaller scale: "I can get from San Jose to downtown SF in a half hour!" It can be done, but only if you're seriously unbalanced.)I can also identify with what I imagine Kowalski's motivations are, especially his self-destructive streak: The realization that you're well past thirty, whatever past attempts at 'real' careers have been blown to hell (for whatever reasons), and hey... You ain't nothing but a fxxking delivery boy.So yeah, I have a soft spot in my heart for Vanishing Point, but mostly due to a higher level of personal identification with Kowalski than most. I'm less likely to kill myself though: After years of covering 1,600 miles a week (without leaving California), I caught myself doing the Death-Stare on the road too many times, and it finally scared me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a legend of freedom, not anything else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't agree with the other reviewers' comments. The car was beautiful, the sound track was fine, OK, but those are not what are left behind in my memory. I think rating this film as a road film or a car film is severely underestimating its value as a legend of "freedom", what 70s were all about. I first saw this film in my early thirties. I was fascinated by the simple yet powerful expression of the will to reach freedom. All the reactions of Kowalsky, the naked rider, the blind DJ, the store owner, etc, they were all after "freedom". And the possibility of being deprived of freedom is the reason why Kowalsky commits suicide at the end. I will remember it as a perfect legend of freedom, and, despite its simplicity, one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

The car they used for most close ups was equipped with Rim blow steering wheel, 15" rallys, am-fm radio, power windows, solid white paint with stripe delete, power bulge hood, polyglas tires and a 4 speed trans with a pistol grip shifter .Barry Newman did some of the stunts himself, and many of the burnouts...I could go on and on but the only thing I can tell you is that I saw this movie when I was 14 and this movie has had a HUGE impact on my life. I have owned over 10 of these E-Body Challengers, including a factory white '70 440 SIX PACK R/T. This is the movie that made me love Mopar, I'm a Dodge fan for life. The '70-'71 Dodge Challengers are truly one of the most gorgeous cars to ever come out of Detroit, check their value in today's market....by the way...the car that hits the dozers at the end is a '68 Camaro....Kowalski lives and Mopar Rules!!!!</fullReview>

In fact it's brilliant, and not in some foot to the floorboards and brain out of the window way either. There IS a lot of meaning, albeit so jumbled up as to defy any reasoned explanation. So get the beers in, get your mates round and enjoy it--all 500 Horse Power, the gleaming chrome, the V8 rumble,the cool DJ, the clanking bulldozers, the surreal nudist and the full circle ending.

		<shortDescription>A great '70s movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the essential 1970s anti-hero movie. It is not supposed to make sense and I have often wondered if it were not meant to be someone's psychedelic dream. Nudity when nudity would not seem to fit; bad cops; beaten people out of sync with plot line. Sounds like a trip. The cast is excellent and this is one of Cleavon Little's last main roles as well as the last main role for the early love interest. John Amos is so underplayed he is almost unrecognizable, I'd love to see his commentary on the movie. And one guy is so ripping off James Dean (though as a racist) that it is unintentionally funny. I'd recommend it as an addition to any American tape library. A true cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vanishingly Little Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Vanishing Point', a chase movie from the early 1970s, can be easily related to other films of the same (or similar) genres. From its predecessor 'Easy Rider' it takes the bleak beauty of western America, a rollicking soundtrack and a structure whereby the continuum of life on the road is punctuated by emblematic, but vague, encounters. Like Spielberg's 'Duel', it is minimalistic in form. But it's outlaw philosophy has more in common with later, sillier films like 'Smokey and the Bandit' and 'The Cannonball Run' (in 'Easy Rider', the heroes simply want to mind their own business; but in 'Vanishing Point', beating the system is the end in itself). This might make the film seem more political, except for the complete vapidness of its central concept: that "freedom" can be defined as the right to burn enormous quantities of oil at life-endangering speeds (indeed, it appears that one of the ways in which the mainstream has persecuted our hero is to attempt to prevent him from driving when drunk). One could say that this film proceeds under the false cloak of counter culturalism, while selling us the same macho dreams as any mainstream Hollywood product. Yet without the pseudo-philosophical justification, this is a movie without point or purpose, whose central character acts without any rational motivation.For all that, the chase itself is gripping, though it's strange (especially for a European) to see what qualified as a sports car in America 30 years ago: this one has huge front and rear overhangs and ridiculously soft suspension. But the worst thing about this movie are its bizarre diversions from the main plot, which include: the cheesiest love scene I can remember; a strange, homophobia-tinged encounter with a couple of gay would-be car-hijackers; a racist attack, apropos of nothing; and, most oddly of all, a meeting with a motorcycling, naked blonde in the middle of the desert. The surprise ending which follows all this might have had an impact if the film that had preceded it had anything to say. The only real reason for watching this film today is as a period piece, a strange mix of reactionary and hippie values that clearly mark it a product of its time. But freedom does not mean irresponsibility; nor does irresponsibility in itself bring freedom, however oppressive we find may the life we are expected to live. Watch 'Five Easy Pieces', a timeless classic from the same era, for a real exploration of these themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a car chase flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie held me spellbound the first time I saw it and is still capable of this after countless viewings. This is more than just a car chase movie, it actually has depth and a story to tell. The scenery of the great American West is also first rate and the soundtrack never fails to set the mood.**THIS PARAGRAGH MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS** The story of the main character, an auto delivery driver named Kowalski unfolds as he takes delivery of a white '70 Dodge Challenger which is as he puts it `souped up to 160' and proceeds to drive it from Denver to San Francisco. His plan, however is to do this in 15 hours to win a bet. As Kowalski makes his journey his life is revealed to us through flashbacks and recollections which are usually triggered by what is currently happening to him in real time. Through these the viewer learns that despite his apparent lawless behavior, Kowalski is a man of good character. One of the big things that drew me into this movie is that it doesn't hand you the explanations on a silver platter. Instead it allows you to think about it and draw your own conclusions long after you've seen it. Certain other reviewers here have already done a great job of touching on the philosophies of freedom and individualism prevalent in this movie, so I won't waste the time trying to top those. I'll add that I feel this is a type of an expressionist film. Kowalski is kind of an `Everyman' (I think people can relate to him) who is on a journey to find his place in the grand scheme of things. Along his path he encounters various characters that watch over him and help him along, but there are also those who wish to shut him down. Whether you think the conclusion of Kowalski's journey is successful or not is up to you.Another big plus is the realism in the driving scenes, where the drivers are actually driving their machines and occasionally things happen like tires going flat or the car needs fuel. Most modern car chase sequences leave me wanting with all of the computer generated car moves and general lack of realism (no, you can't shoot a car repeatedly with a .50 calibre machine gun without harming the occupants or engine). I know they sometimes got it wrong back then too, doing things like obviously speeding the film up. In this one though, they got it right. The driving here brings us into that realm of manhandling 4000 lbs. of American Iron, in all the glory of big-block V8 roar, screaming smoking tires, and hands flying over the steering wheel.Another thing that's cool to me about this type of movie is the appearance of the car. At the beginning, the car is resplendent in gleaming chrome and white paint. As the story moves along, the car gradually gets a more dusty battered countenance. I won't spoil the end, but those who've seen it know.The final things that tie this whole thing together are the soundtrack and scenery. They seem to go hand in hand, from the upbeat rock &amp; roll as Kowalski starts out to the stirring guitar strains during the thoughtful moments. I also cannot say enough about the scenery, which really sucks the viewer in. It ranges from the mountains of Colorado, across Utah and into the searing Nevada desert.In closing, I'll say that this is one of my favorite movies. It won't be understood by everyone, but those of us who fantasize about getting in a classic car and blasting down an open two-lane highway devoid of SUV's, sport sedans and minivans will likely get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you ever build enough speed on the road to escape your past &amp; your pain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vanishing Point" asks the question and, like other films of this kind before "Smokey &amp; the Bandit" brought the genre to an end, lets us ponder the answer on our own. Other than that, there's no point to this film except to demonstrate that the Challenger is one of the best-looking muscle/sports cars ever made. Get too far into this movie &amp; you'll want to sell your children to have one. Kowalski is a '70s knight-errant, or a Greek mythological hero, just as you please. He rides his Hemi-powered steed on a quest to San Francisco, not for a "what," or a "why," or even for a lady fair, but only for "how fast." Does he seek redemption? Escape? Self-forgiveness? To stick it to the Man? Who cares? Knavish cops close in on him, lotus-eaters like Hovah (Darden) shun him, sirens (especially the stark-naked Texter, who would've stopped Burt Reynolds's Bandit faster than Sally Field ever did) want him to dally. Sharp-featured, Western character actor Anthony James has a hilarious, uncharacteristic turn as a gay hitchhiker. Humble, noble souls come forth to guide Kowalski like angels, including a scruffy snake-hunter (Jagger), chopper jockey &amp; drug dealer Angel (Scott), and the blind deejay Super Soul (Little, who should've been a contender for the part of Howard Beal in "Network"). The Man's attempts to explain Kowalski are annoying distractions, so hit the "mute" button when you see scenes of cops in offices. And stop wondering why Kowalski, on his quest for speed, is always being overtaken &amp; passed by other vehicles. Just put your brain in neutral, put your popcorn where it's handy, and buckle up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The finest period piece ever. This film so encapsulates the decades I grew up in. The stereotypes portrayed remain true to this day. The cops are corrupt, the racists are ignorant and the true believers in true freedom are overwhelmed in the end... sigh. Some things never change, my friends. Read Edward Abbey for further insight to this spectacularly polished and perfect low-budget movie. The film "Lonely are the Brave", starring a very young Kirk Douglas and and even younger Walter Matthau is a close parallel in gorgeous black and white. It is based on "The Last Cowboy" by Abbey, but his masterpiece "A Fools Progress" illustrates -almost as completely as "Vanishing Point"- the heartbreaking philosophy that mourns the final death of true freedom in the one Empire that claimed to champion it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vanishing Point seems to be one of those films on the cusp between the 60's era psychedelia and the 70's tough guy cop chase movies. It has elements of both and could have been so much more had it focused more on the main character and less on the nonsense. In so many films of this type the lead meets up with the strangest people just to be strange and it adds little to the overall story. I recall the scene in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot where they encounter that crazy guy who shoots rabbits from his trunk and funnels the exhaust into the cars interior, why, we don't know and never find out. In Vanishing Point we have to two weird gay bandits in one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever watched and a revival meeting in the desert that seems just thrown in and pointless.The Dodge Challenger obviously is just incredible and is a star in it's own right and the shots of it screaming across the desert highways are just fantastic. I'm not sure of the whole delivery premise to begin with, he doesn't seem to care if the car is damaged, so why is he in a hurry to deliver it and didn't they have Dodge dealerships in CA in 1970???. Is it a death wish from the start? It's hard to see this now and realize that car was brand new and one of the true monsters of the road at the time. The movie is dated like most older films but I don't rate movies based on that, you have to take into account the time and not compare it to today.Clevon Little's role is just incredibly stupid with him feeling the drivers moves or whatever and the music they choose does not fit the scenario at all, you would of expected a much harder soundtrack. I'm still not sure why there is a soul station in the middle of nowhere, and it must have one powerful signal to reach such a long distance. In fact the music here is so bad and forgettable I can't imagine anyone listing it as part of the reason they like this film. A lot of movies from this era used groups they thought were going to be popular or are friends of the producer, there is not one hit from the 60's or 70's here except "Mississippi Queen" which is used for ten seconds and in the wrong place.More weird to be weird is the naked chick but I guess there is a running theme of wispy blonds in his past, but how in the hell would she have a collage of his history?The ending is so disconnected from the rest of the movie, the crowd awaiting his arrival don't even seem to be in the same scene and it ends so anticlimactically. Why did they suddenly use a Camaro to blow up instead of the Dodge, you can even see the letters on the side nameplate. The beginning had a good feel to it and I can't imaging how great this would have been had it been more structured and been a straight action film instead of trying to become some religious message wrapped in a Challenger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just received a DVD of this film and was pleasantly surprised. The image is restored and looks great. After years of watching grainy and scratched prints its nice to see it as it was in 1971. Theatrical trailer and two TV spots are included. Commentary by Richard C. Sarifian brings some insights into filming locations, the various actors, etc. (Gilda Texter was severely sunburned during her desert motorcycle ride and she was girl friend of actor Paul Koslo who also appears in film.) And a story of a prostitute befriended by the crew,who stole the last remaining challenger. (eight were used, only one survived.) She was caught sometime later. The real treat is actressCharlotte Ramplings missing scene near the end of the film. While it really adds nothing to the story,its nice to finally see the missing footage after thirty years. There are also some striking images of the challenger at daybreak in that previously missing scene. The only thing lacking is commentary from the STAR of the film, Barry Newman,which would have made this a Great DVD.</fullReview>

I should know! I was a resident in this picturesque little town of 110 people (in 1971). The Goldfield Hotel has since found new life as a restored historical landmark. The town itself has surged in population due to new mining processes, and the re-opening of the long closed mines. During the movie, a scene picturing the front of the "Green Frog Market", you will see the faint glow of a freckle-faced, red headed little boy, gazing out of the window......yeah..it's me!! This movie was quite exciting in a town of 110 people!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in 1971 and was blown away by the thing, it was very enigmatic, the viewer had to actually THINK ! about the plot. There were so many gaps in the plot, it was hugely open to personal interpretation. Kowalski had no first name, he had no reason to rush the delivery journey, he had no reason to die! I can remember the elation of seeing the chase scenes for the first time and remember the fact that NO special effects were used, the car did exactly what it said on the box ! Excellent film (sad and pointless, but excellent) oh yes , and music to take you right back when. To this day, the 1970/71 Dodge Challenger R/T is THE coolest car on the roads (sorry, Bullitt fans). This film Is dated ,but thats not a bad thing, For all the advances of film technology, they couldn't better this when they made the 1997? remake, it was TOO user friendly, all the gaps where filled in, (name, motive,etc)and it became just another chase movie. This original was probably the first real road movie of modern times, also, SUPERSOUL, so hip, so camp, so funky, so 70's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel this is one of the greatest road movies ever made.For lovers of these genre of movies this film offers ultimate experience.The chase sequences have been brilliantly filmed in desert locations.But i feel the movie's ending is a bit sudden. Kowalski's character is very much representative of the concept of freedom and openness.The same qualities that led to the creation of a great nation but the deterioration of which is beautifully portrayed in subtle ways.The crash seen could be seen as the ultimate protest of free soul against the oppressive and over powering bureaucracy.The chase sequences have been carefully taken.The white car is symbolic of white horse since horse could be considered as the correct representation of wild west.It also denotes freedom of both expressions and actions.The character riding the white car could be equated to a knight riding white horse ie a medieval times take over.The idea is the dark forces which existed during the medieval times are still relevant.Even though ultimate victory cannot be said to be fully with either good or bad forces the director has clearly portrayed that such bold fight against establishments are bound to happen throughout history of mankind ; one such as of Kowalski's.The brave fight put up by kowalski , the refusal to accept defeat,considering death more noble than surrendering oneself to evil forces are typical behavior and values which contributed to the creation of one of the greatest nations of the world.The deterioration of these characters is painfully portrayed by the director.A must see movie ......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Dad was a local drag racing hero in Gastonia NC in the 1960's. He was (and still is) a Mopar man. So whenever a car movie came out featuring a 'Cuda, Charger, or Challenger, we piled up and went out, usually to the drive-in.In 1973 I turned 10 yrs. old, and we saw Vanishing Point when it was released, so I musta' been 8 or so, way too young to get anything but "oh boy, fast car" out of it. However, somehow, I got it. Not the 'religious" symbolism, but the fact that I was seeing - no - experiencing a counter-culture film. As an 8 yr. old, it FELT like what I later found out it was supposed to be; a cool, hip, statement on the after-effects of the late '60's turmoil.Throughout the next 30 years, because the movie did not raise a fuss, I felt like it was MY cool secret - just me and my Dad. I could vividly remember many scenes in my head (in my 20's and 30's) without ever seeing the movie again.A film that enters your head off and on for 30+ years after seeing it once as a small child, is a testament to the power of a great film. It just goes to show that you don't need a fabulous script with big name actors and beauceats (boo-koos) of special effects to make a truly memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much an artifact of its time... *SPOILER*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I just rented Vanishing Point based on my roommate's constant raves about it. Well, I'll be the first to admit that I just don't get it.I've read other comments alluding to its allegorical Christian and post-60s subtexts. Fine. But for a film to work metaphorically, it needs to work on a literal level. What we have here are details that don't make much sense. Does Kowalski really hear Cleavon Little in his mind, or the radio? (It's hard to believe that a Denver radio station's output can reach all the way to Nevada.) What's with the racist attack on Little at the station? (The bluntedly obvious irony of the attack juxtaposed with a "Love Everyone" tune aside, the purpose of the scene failed to enlighten me or propel the story.) What's with the choir in the desert? What's with the naked chick??? And all the flashbacks and police reports didn't tell me a whole lot about what makes this guy tick. What is the point of this movie??? That men desire the open desert road with no societal restrictions??? Don't stop the presses...Anyway, like I said, I'm probably not tuned in to its message (I never cared for Easy Rider, either.) Vanishing Point was made three years before I was born, and perhaps I needed to have experienced the era to appreciate something like this (this may be why I adore Almost Famous, Dazed and Confused, and Woodstock so much for their nostalgia purposes - jeez, how much do I wish my parents conceived me twenty years earlier!) I do, however, admire the filmmaking techniques of this time, especially the downbeat endings (I'm a big fan of They Shoot Horses, Don't They), which is why I saw the crash coming from so far away, I had time to trim my nails and read my EW. Cool car, though.So, if somebody can clue me in, drop me a line. In the meantime, I'll just keep spinning my Zeppelin and Who CDs, and remember a past for which I wasn't present. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been in love with this movie ever since i was kid. When i first saw trailer on TV with beautiful white Challenger speeding over the road, i knew that this is the movie that i will like.From the opening scene with small desert town early in the morning, through car chases and great,bizarre characters that main hero meets on his journey, i simply couldn't get enough of the movie. Barry Newman plays Kowalski with great attitude as silent, otherworldly-like guy who drives for one reason; because he can.He doesn't really need a reason to get to San Francisco inside 15 hours, he just wants another challenge. Maybe he is adrenaline junkie, or somebody who wants to pay back to the system that took his life apart? It doesn't really matter, cause entire time that he spends on lonely desert roads, being chased by cops he becomes hero for people like him. People who have been attacked by the law just because they wanted what he wants. They wanted to be free. Unfortunately, at the time when movie was made, things weren't so great for USA, and everyone were in fight with one another, and the part where Kowalski gets in road fight with Jaguar driver is perfect example of this.Ending of the movie is very sad, but in a way,it is the perfect ending for Kowalski who has suffered so much throughout his life that death is not "only way to escape", he could surrender and spend some time behind bars, but his own decision to go someplace else.What that place is,nobody knows, but he wanted to go there. Why? Maybe he was tired of the world in which he was living for so long that he wanted to move in some other world where he wouldn't need to be worry when will somebody stab him in the back, since already it happened to him too many times. Maybe, he truly was last free soul in the world which he was the part of, and he couldn't stand it anymore. Girl in black that he picked up night before his last day was, in a way, death coming to welcome him into the afterlife, sort of speak. That's why he accepted her company, because he knew that next day, he will finally reach his destination, finish line for which he drove his entire life.This is my own view of this fine movie. No matter how old VANISHING POINT is, it is still greatest car chase movie ever, not because of the some incredible chase scenes, but because of the way that story stays true to the way that world still turns, and there is always some lonely soul out there that fights hard to get to its own finish line. Definitely recommended for every car loving guys and girls, and for everyone who love old cult classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched "Vanishing Point" as a rebellious teenager growing up in Asia, before I got my driver's license or had a chance to travel to America. I skipped school so that I could catch the matinee show. The year was '72. (I guess it took a while for movies to be distributed to Asia back then). One thing I got out of the movie was, "Wow, so that's the kind of cool stuff you could do in the US." I fell in love with so many things at once. Cars. Driving on an open road. The US. The open desert scenery. Above all, the freedom. I never looked back. Now, whenever given the chance, I'm out west on the open road. Since that movie, I've traveled to 42 US states, and still counting. In fact, I'll be off to the Death Valley and other parts of the Mojave next week...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of 70's movies I was really looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, I was let down by a few things.The acting is reasonable, but with so little script, there's little characterisation to latch onto. I understand that the main character Kowalski is supposed to be a loner and doesn't say much, but if this is the case, the supporting characters need to bring something more to proceedings. As it stands, the only other character worthy of note is Super Soul and and although he does an adequate job of playing the stereotypical soulman, it's not enough.I like films with a plot. I don't mind if it's drawn out or confusing as long as it's there and it makes me think. This movie so wants to be deep, and yet it fails. The idea that Kowalski is a symbol of freedom is all well and good, but since what he's doing is pointless and benefits nobody, how is he free? Because he decides to drive dangerously fast so he can get a better deal on some drugs when he gets home? I don't have a problem with the pro-drugs nature of the movie, but as for a statement of freedom, I don't see it. Lets say he runs over someone and kills them - how is he free?In reading the reviews here, many people seem to have misinterpreted the meaning of this film. To me, it's more of a statement of a man's reaction against his despair at the downturn in his life. He feels so isolated and ruined - his previous jobs were ace racing driver and top cop and now he's a lowly car delivery man. He goes on one final pointless race, but this time it's against the world (hence his last self destructive act.)It's one final act of defiance against a life with a rapidly vanishing point (hence the title in case you're not paying attention.) If it is to do with freedom, it's only in that he frees himself from his miserable life.Even if this is the meaning behind it (if there is one at all) the film doesn't deal with it very well.Likewise, the characters he meets along the way are woefully underused. The religious cult has little point (apart from perhaps symbolising the breakdown of traditional religious beliefs) and only just makes it onto the screen before its gone again. The two homosexuals he picks up on the road are disposed of before we know anything about them. The police officers are just stupid planks for him to run off the road a la Smokie and the Bandit. The traveling dude who collects snakes - he barely even had a chance to establish a character before he's gone again. The nude motorcycle rider - let's face it - she was just there for us guys to look at (not that I mind, but why not give her a reason to be there rather than some contrived idea that Kowalski rescued her when she was a kid?)On the plus side, I did enjoy the car chases, although considering they're the main focus of the film, they weren't even as good as those in other movies (Bullitt, French Connection etc.) Likewise, the music was good, but not great. What I did like a lot was the fact that this is a period piece - it personifies a time when the hippy movement was breaking down and society was in a state of flux. It's stylised in a way that I really enjoyed and at times reminded me of Duel or more applicably Easy Rider.To sum up, if you're a fan of 70's movies - this one could be for you. If you enjoyed Easy Rider, this isn't anywhere near as good but is well worth a look. Not a classic, but very interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond an exciting story, "Vanishing Point" shows some great commercial views of Denver and Colorado that now are, sadly, lost to history.During the early part of the film, we're treated to numerous location shots of 16th Street downtown and several industrial areas. Once the chase gets under way and Kowalski is pursued by the motorcycle patrolmen, the filmmakers used portions of what was later to become Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon. That stretch of highway was two-lane then, but now is superslabbed throughout the canyon.Also note an appearance by longtime Denver TV newsman Bob Palmer, who interviews Sandy about "the Kowalski saga." Palmer holds a mic during the scene, but his cameraman is wielding what appears to be a silent 16 mm camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I owned a Dodge Challenger of that era and that is the only reason I watched "Vanishing Point". The car is the star of this very weak movie.Why the great urgency to deliver the car? Who would knowingly hire a drug-dependent driver to deliver cars from one locale to another? Kowalski is determined to win a bet based on a small drug deal. Forget the condition the car might arrive in - if it arrives at all, which it doesn't.The premise of the story is preposterous and silly.The script, the characterizations, the dialog are all lame. The direction is one step above amateur. The driving and camera work are good but that's about it.Newman has looks and charm but the character he plays is almost a cartoon.The continuity errors are numerous - ie: the car suffers apparent damage that disappears in subsequent scenes.Save your time or watch it with the sound off. At the very least, spare yourself the director's wacky running commentary - which only proves that drugs really do damage your mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can remember reading a review for "VP" when it was released that said something to the effect of "I wouldn't want to be driving down the street of a drive-in movie after this ends and the kids in their cars are leaving" Being 16 years old at the time-the reviewer was absolutely correct. VP packed them in at the drive-ins, this was still the era of big engines and cheap gas. In a few years the Arab oil embargo, sky rocketing insurance rates, and pollution regulations would cripple the Detroit's muscle car industry, but Hollywood in the early 70's still made car chase movies like "VP," "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry" and "Smoky &amp; the Bandit" in the tradition of Bob Mitchum's 1950's epic, "Thunder Road" that featured about 90 minutes of car chases weaved through a thin plot line.VP has a minuscule plot that logic totally escapes any logic:1) Kowalski is supposed to be driving this Dodge Challenger from Denver to SF for a car delivery service, presumably to someone who will take possession of a muscle car in mint condition. Kowalski completely drives the complete crap out of it, on and off road.2) Kowalski leaves Denver around midnight, but we see him driving in daylight along the breathtaking stretch of I-70 adjacent to the Colorado River in Glenwood Springs, which is only 156 mi. from Denver. Where has Kowalski been all evening? (come to think of it, the only time we see him drive at night is leaving Denver)3) We only see him stop once for gasoline. I would imagine that the 440 Magnum Dodge engine being driven at 120 mph might get 8mpg. So with a 20 gallon tank Kowalski is going to have to stop at least every hour &amp; half. Speaking of which, why don't the police, instead of chasing him with cars, choppers and setting up roadblocks, just wait for him at the few gas stations that are few and far between in the remote sections of Ut &amp; Nv?4) the AM radio station, KOW that has the DJ "Supersoul" that aids Kowalski looks like it is in a tiny town in western Nv, I would guess 100 watts, yet Kowalski is able to pick this station up quite clearly all the way from Colorado.Enough logic. great car chases. hot looking naked chick on a motorcycle shows up later for no reason. not a bad way to spend 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1970s Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years before "Smokey and the Bandit" would present a confusing mixture of messages about the joys of traveling the road, came "Vanishing Point", a superb film about which so much could be written. I saw this film when it first came out--a nineteen year old who could really identify with the film's point of view.Yes, this film owes a debt to "Easy Rider" (1969) and "Bonnie and Clyde" (1967), but the anti-heroes of "Easy Rider" were looking for truth. Kowalski, the anti-hero of "Vanishing Point" is looking for freedom.This film should be classified under "fantasy". It is a libertarian fantasy, a dream of escaping the control and corruption of the establishment (as it was then called). In the early 70s, a great turmoil enveloped this country. Those who fought for peace (in the shadow of the Vietnam conflict), racial equality, a redefining of gender roles, and the freedom of the individual to do or become whatever he desires (as long as it does not violate the freedom of others) became the counterculture, a massive challenge to the status quo and those who wished to maintain traditional values.Kowalski (Barry Newman) is a man who's background and history is revealed throughout the film. From a man who merely drives for a living, he becomes a man who is trying to cope with the tragedies and inequalities of his past. Eventually, he becomes a hero to the people on the fringe of society who recognize his fight as their own. He battles the "blue meanies" (a reference to The Beatles' "Yellow Submarine"). There are various clues that this is a fantasy. No one gets hurt despite some dangerous activities. This is important because Kowalski is not out to hurt others. There are also some scenes that, though "real", seem almost to be dreams.As he drives his Challenger (of course) down western highways that disappear in the infinite at that vanishing point on the horizon, we begin to see that this is one man's rebellion, as assertion that he will no longer be controlled. This man of few words has nothing left to lose, perhaps.Accompanied by some great tunes and the encouragement of a blind DJ, Kowalski meets some interesting characters. Watch for Dean Jagger in a small, choice role as a snake hunter. "Vanishing Point" has a great cast of credited and uncredited actors and musicians.Will Kowalski (like Moses) lose his way in the desert, but eventually emerge to find a promised land? Will he become invincible and larger than life? Will he become a martyr, either by intention or by accident?One could write pages about this film and its messages. It helps to have seen it in 1971, to experience it as part of the milieu of its time. But this film is a metaphor for principles that are timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vanishing Point is the type of movie rarely seen these days. It has so many identities, a car chase movie simply being one of them. It both deconstructs and pays tribute to the American love affair with the automobile and cinema. It's also a love letter to the 60s, playing up themes of freedom and escaping oppression. Most importantly, it's a classic heroes journey. Kowalski, the hero has a mission, a romantically Americana mission, and he let's nothing get in his way. Movies like Vanishing Point aren't duplicated, because they cannot be. They are products of their time, a tribute to both films and ideals past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epitaph to the Muscle car era.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been written about this movie, so the story is well known. The main character is a man known as Kowalski who delivers cars for a living. He has done other things though. He was a Vietnam veteran, a former car and bike racing driver and an ex cop, but in the film he collects a car on a Friday night in Colorado to drive it back to San Francisco, California, in 15 hours. ( a journey of some 1200 miles ).Given the car he is driving, a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T 440ci V8 with a 4 speed manual transmission, which is also allegedly " hopped up to over 160 ", it is technically achievable, however, as he will be driving mainly on the back roads, no one seems to think he can do it. To help him, he visits a friend at the start and take a supply of speed and then gets on his way. And then the fun begins.So what is the movie really about?....Well, if you read all the other comments, and I recommend you do, you will see the main points of the plot and events, etc, so I wont be repeating these here, but to me, none of them get to the real raison d'etre of Kowalski and the movie.You first have to look at the time period in the US in 1970/71. The Vietnam war was still ongoing and by then the protest against it was very wide spread. In addition, there was still a very strong racism element and the US was in effect a Police state, only much more so than today.Then there was the Muscle care era which was at its peak in 1970/71, but by 1973, it was all but dead as emission laws made many of the big block engines illegal. The 70 Dodge Challenger R/T 440 ci V8 was one of the fastest in its day and with a 4 speed manual transmission was good for around 375 bhp in stock form, however, we are told that it is hopped up to do over 160 mph, ( standard was around 140 mph ) although no details of how it is tuned are given other than a couple of cops saying it is allegedly supercharged.Then he have Kowalski himself. On face value it would seem he has been a failure throughout his life ( well the bits we get to see in flash back ), but is he really?....No. The way he drives the Dodge shows you that he is in a different league to the cops and like all racing drivers, instead of slowing down, he changes down and accelerates to even faster speeds, so he isn't simply a good driver, he is a great driver. One of the very best.He doesn't just drive the car, he becomes part of it and it becomes part of him. He knows that whenever he changes down a gear or two, he has rocket like acceleration that will get him out of trouble and when the roads get closed off, he simply takes it out into the desert. As Super soul says, Kowalski is one of the last great American hero's and that is what the movie is really about.It is an epitaph to the last of the real hero's, Kowalski, the last of the real muscle cars and the last blast of a freedom that the police are trying to destroy. Kowalski knows that, just like the muscle car, his time has come and gone, so he pushes himself on an almost impossible journey that he knows will end in his death. After all, what is there to live for. Nothing except the speed and the race, and so at the end we see him smash into two bulldozers rather than surrender.On face value, this seems madness. He could easily stop and although he might be imprisoned for a while ( or maybe not as he hadn't really done anything wrong ), he would get to drive again, but for Kowalski its not so simplistic. He is on a one way journey and this is evident by the flash backs to the past events in his life. We see him as a racing car driver, a bike racer, when he was a cop and the death of his beloved. He whole life story is laid out along the road, so it is obvious that death is the only destination. This is further confirmed when we see the naked chick shows him all the news stories she has collected about him long before this journey. Its like she is an Angel saying, this was your life Kowalski.There is also the scene not in the US versions ), where he picks up a female hitchhiker ( death ) who spends the night with him and then mysteriously disappears before he wakes. Kowalski knows its coming, but rather than fear it, he drives into the next world at maximum speed, smiling and with him dies the last of the great muscle cars.Whether you agree with my synopsis or not, this is one of the great movies of all time and if you do nothing else in your life, you have to see this film and preferably on a big screen with surround sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Chrysler was first approached for this film, the executive who eventually green-lighted their participation could not believe that anyone would ever watch it. "It's basically a 90 minute ad for a car," he is reputed to have said. Understatement! This 90 minute ad became such a cult hit that an attempt was made to redo it (kindly notice my selection of the word "attempt" and we will discuss the remake no more in this life). Barry Newman had proved a reliable TV actor to that point, but no one had guessed that he would infuse the character of Kowolski with such (pardon the pun) drive. Don't want to give too much away on the off chance you have not seen this film yet, but other reviewers who have opined that this film is a metaphor for the demise of America (from the freedom of the open road, to a police state, with rules and penalties for breaking those rules) may not be far off the mark. See the original, not the AHEM-NEVER-TO-DISCUSSED remake, prepare for a look at the US when freedom was more than a 7 letter world, and prepare for what may possibly be Newman's best work in his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great chase sequences cannot save its trippy, existential mess - 68%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember an old episode of "Top Gear" where host Jeremy Clarkson insisted that this was the best car movie ever, something which stuck in my mind and raised my interest when it eventually came up in the schedules. I can see his argument - this film's driving sequences (of which there are many) are some of the best I've ever seen in movies, especially given how old this film is. But for all the handbrake turns and screaming tyres, the film's existential subtext turns what might have been a spiritual prequel to "Smokey And The Bandit" into the longest and fastest trip cinema has ever seen.After completing his latest delivery in Denver, the mysterious Kowalski (Barry Newman) takes it upon himself to deliver a white Dodge Challenger to San Fransisco within a few days. Despite his friends warning him to rest up, Kowalski takes a handful of uppers and hits the road, quickly earning the attention of the state police. As he speeds across the US towards California, he is guided by a blind DJ named Super Soul (Cleavon Little) and encounters a number of hippies and hitch-hikers along the way. But as the net tightens ever closer, can Kowalski hope to get to Frisco in time? Feeding off the post-Woodstock vibe at the time, "Vanishing Point" is certainly an intriguing picture. In it's simplest form, it is a great chase flick full of gripping driving sequences and scored by a combination of evocative songs and the Challenger's V8 rumble. But with this interpretation, the film ends on a real downer so looking at it from a more intellectual viewpoint, it becomes one man's quest for freedom and his struggles against society and the oppressive regimes that control us all. The cops are all pretty much interchangeable and it's only those Kowalski comes across that stand out - the biker Angel (Timothy Scott) and his nude girlfriend (Gilda Texter) have more charisma and more to offer to the film than any law-enforcement officer in the movie. But that ending gives me more problems - I cannot see why it was written like that unless I've missed the point (it is 3am as I write this, I should point out!) or the drugs that probably help to understand the movie.For most of the movie, I did enjoy "Vanishing Point" although I wanted to learn more about Kowalski - who is he and why is he racing to San Fransisco? The film offers tantalising glimpses of the man but maybe these aren't required - if "Vanishing Point" is to be taken as an allegory then I fear it might have missed the boat. I understand that there was a scene with Charlotte Rampling that was cut but reading about this scene, I feel the film would have worked better if the scene were left in. As it is, however, "Vanishing Point" suffers by having a point that sadly... err, vanishes. Die-hard petrol heads like Clarkson will enjoy the many driving scenes as this film is really little more than one epic car chase but personally, I prefer something more modern (try "Drive" for a similar experience to this or the "Gone In Sixty Seconds" remake if you don't want to think too much) or from the era, why not watch "Bullitt" which is even better. "Vanishing Point" walks the walk but alas, talking the talk is beyond it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One man, one badass car, and a veritable staple of '70s cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into "Vanishing Point" thinking it was a precursor to "Smokey and the Bandit". The main character accepts a bet to make it to a certain destination within an alloted time using a fast car. But "Bandit" is a charming comedy, while "Vanishing Point" features very little in the way of laughs; it is, on the other hand contemplative, and packs a serious punch. In this case, the bet is to drive from Denver to San Francisco in two days. Behind the wheel of a superbad Dodge Challenger and armed with a fistful of speed pills, the main character, Kowalski (Barry Newman), wastes no time in getting the attention of the Highway Patrol. Roaring car chases ensue as the wrecked police cruisers pile up while a quasi-mystical radio DJ (Cleavon Little) calls the plays over the airwaves and cheers our hero on to his final destination. Beautifully shot, this is the road movie to end all road movies, if you ask me. At its core, "Vanishing Point" is about a man who's driving. One who rebelliously takes to the roadways out to the wide open American West. Little snatches of flashback reveal our lead to be a world-weary Vietnam vet-turned-police detective who also spent some time as a demolition derby driver. Beyond that, he's a mystery. There are well-choreographed car chases and some serious stunt work, but this is ultimately about a man who has lost and eventually regains a sense of hope in the far reaches of the desert. But the filmmakers wisely keep it simple (on the surface, at least) and keep our attention glued on the important thing: that righteous Challenger. This movie's beating heart is heard with every roar of that 440 Magnum engine, and that car (the real star of this thing) makes for a supreme piece of car-chase machinery.It's wholeheartedly a product of its time and place, hinting at the coming demise of the '60s counter-culture. I dig this movie's rebellious soul, and I'm still reeling from that punch-to-the-gut ending. Wielding a soundtrack that lives on 40 years after initial release, "Vanishing Point" is an undeniable classic. For my money, this is the greatest car- chase/road movie ever made, and a personal favorite.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kowalski is the epitome of disillusionment. Everything he's ever tried doing in life has ended in failure, from attempted careers in stock/bike racing and law enforcement to even his love life, as evidenced when he isn't there to save his girlfriend from drowning.Kowalski's been relegated to taking a position as a driver for Argo's Car Delivery service in Denver, Colorado, where he takes possession of a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T that must be delivered to San Francisco, California in four days time. On his way out of town, Kowalski stops at a biker bar seeking to obtain some "bennies", slang for Benzedrine, a stimulant similar to methamphetamine. He makes a bet with his dealer Jake (for the price of drugs) that he can make it from Denver to Frisco in just fifteen hours (considerably sooner than his actual deadline). Jake initially thinks Kowalski is putting him on, to which Kowalski replies "I wish to God I was..." Now, that's an interesting response considering we, the audience, know that Kowalski doesn't actually have to be there that fast. So, why say it? It seems rather obvious that he's got more of a stake in getting to Frisco than he's willing to admit...but what's in Frisco? This is just speculation on my part, but I don't believe anything is waiting for him in the "City by the Bay". I think he sets up a seemingly low-stakes bet for drugs in the same way a childhood friend might have dared you to dare him to throw a rock through a window. It was something he wanted to do anyway, but if you dared him to do it -- he had to do it, or he was "chicken". I think Kowalski did very much the same thing by telling Jake he had to be to San Fran in an almost impossible amount of time. He could've just set out across the American Southwest all his own sans bet and still tried to make it as quickly as possible, but by getting Jake to bet him, he was now accountable to someone other than himself to succeed, or die trying.He wants to make it from Denver to San Francisco in fifteen hours to "redeem" himself for his past failures. He's isn't suicidal, he's just reckless, The harder the authorities give chase, the harder he flees.Sandy, Kowalski's boss at Argo's Car Delivery, gives an interview to a newsman later in the movie that suggests the reason Kowalski never "made the grade" as a stock/bike racer was not because he didn't have the goods, but rather because he never really cared about winning. This would certainly suggest a nihilistic mindset, for which Kowalski simply didn't see the point in winning, or at least he didn't at that time.I think by the time Kowalski decides to take his fateful trip, he's taken a more existential approach and decided his trip is a way through which he can give his own life meaning. In the grand scheme of things, do Kowalski's life or his chase really matter? Maybe not, but it helped to give him a purpose. It also provided us with probably the only existential car chase movie in existence and one hell of a good time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Valid judgements demand constructive comparison. Like: is Anton Chigurh better or worse than the Bubonic Plague? In the case of Vanishing Point the ideal comparison is with Two-Lane Blacktop. These two films seem to have been produced at just about the same time in 1971, and they both describe an episodic road journey from somewhere to somewhere else. The road trip is actually the most ancient form of story-telling, stretching back to the Epic of Gilgamesh, about five thousand years ago. Gilgamesh and his buddy Enkidu set off in search of immortality, but don't find it.Here we see that voting on the IMDb site rates VP at 7.1 stars, and 2LBT at 7.3 stars. I submit that the gap between these two productions is infinitely greater than 0.2 stars. More like 3.5 or 4 stars. VP is not an uninteresting film, but 2LBT is an all-time great. VP features Barry Newman, hailed by the Los Angeles Times as the "Spencer Tracy of the 80's." Is that an enviable accolade? Barry isn't too bad in his role as a car driver. 2LBT, on the other hand, features Warren Oates, who can simply be hailed as the peerless actor, Warren Oates. Period.The episodes in VP are silly, but in 2LBT they are not. Super Soul and the undressed crumpet riding a motorbike in VP are positively Monty Python silly. The trashing of Super Soul's radio station comes out of nowhere, and is virtually inexplicable: in any case, it's not well explained. The stick-up by the queers in VP is just ridiculous; whereas the queer cowboy in 2LBT is sad and pathetic. On the other hand there's a lot of humour in 2LBT, but virtually none in VP. There are a lot of driving stunts in VP, but, in a way, when you've seen one stunt, you've seen them all. My disc omits the episode with Charlotte Rampling, but this doesn't seem to matter much. Not that I'd know.Vanishing Point is worth watching more than once, if only to help puzzle out what its pointless point is. However, unlike 2LBT, it does not improve with repeated viewings. The point seems to be that not only is life a bitch, but also a bore, and then you die. So what, precisely, is its point? Skip Easy Rider (1969). Try Five Easy Pieces (1970).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jezz, I love this movie! I learnt about it in Deathproof, - that's how I learn about the classics - I hear it from Tarantino, - and thought it was gonna be another piece of c*ap that he usually talks about so enthusiastically.(Don't get me wrong, Rio Bravo, Leone movies, Taxi Driver are OK, but name them in your personal top 3?!!! Besides, after watching the original Inglorious Bastards I left any hope of figuring what the guy was made of.) But it was Tarantino's words so I was obsessed, even possessed by the idea of watching this movie. And OMG! I couldn't believe it! It's amazing, I felt myself behind that wheel, driving, driving, driving the he*l out of the car, the road, everything! It is so breathtaking just to drive pass all the barriers and lines. I hate being stopped by traffic lights, by speed limits, by some slow-ass upfront, by idiots crossing the street where they feel like, not where are supposed to according to the law, it is so unbelievable to drive beyond all that!!! I remember when I first drove in town, I couldn't believe this new feeling, the feeling of going fast, the feeling of being FREE, of being ALIVE. I really felt that I had never lived before. The instructor told me not to floor the gas, but I didn't feel like flooring it, so I told him so, after a couple of times he gave up and said: "Ok, FLOOR IT!!!". I took it as a licence to kill. After the ride there was all the lectures and shouts about security and other boring stuff, but then I just was FREE!!! The cops stopped someone and were checking him, the instructor went pale and informed me that he washed his hands and if anything happened I should talk to the cops myself. We flew right past them, they didn't even notice. I was too happy to care! I figure had something happened then, like an accident, I'd have died happy.I loved watching that movie, I loved that Kowalski had that feeling for the entire ride, for hours, the feeling of true happiness and joy. Outdriving and outsmarting the cops and anybody else who tried to challenge his skills and FREEDOM. He didn't really hurt anyone, but the society (the cops) tried to bring him down. Just being a free individual you're committing a crime against society. He's a true hero.I so much loved the ending, even though I cried, I know that Kowalski at that moment was the happiest man in the world!!! A free soul. I just don't agree with Soul that he is the last free soul in the world...IMO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I have no problem deciding how many stars to give a film. But with Vanishing Point, I have no idea at all.I saw it several times when it first came out, and I've seen it several times since. I know what happens in it - Kowalski, driving a car across the States to deliver it to the west coast, becomes the target of a nationwide police hunt, while simultaneously becoming a folk hero thanks to a blind radio DJ - but I still don't know what it's about. Maybe there is a subtext at work here which references national issues, not universal ones. Maybe I'm not capable of reading the subtext. Or maybe there simply isn't one.Perhaps it is simply a very slight story which forms a basis for lots of shots of a fast car driving through the desert. And there's nothing wrong with that, I suppose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kowalski works for a car delivery service and he makes a bet that he can get the car from Colorado to San Francisco by Sunday. It's Friday night and Kowalski starts out and the whole time the police are after him where ever he goes. He just can't seem to avoid the police at any time. He also picks up people along the way such as a man with snakes, two gay guys, and a naked lady on a motorcycle. The movie is fast paced, exciting and fun to watch. When the audience thinks that he won't make it through some barrier or something, he finds a way to make it and continue on towards San Francisco. There is also a blind radio DJ who sort of tells him what to do the whole time. Sometimes Kowalski listens to him and sometimes he doesn't. The movie is a lot of fun to watch even if you're not into car chase movies. Give it a chance and see how exciting it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Never Sits Still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vanishing Point" is the counter culture movie to end all counter culture movies. It's got it all -- the grizzled, moody anti-hero; the rebellion against authority; the naked hippies; the criticism of racial oppression; the bleak, "what's the point of it all?" existential angst. But first and foremost, "Vanishing Point" is one hell of a kick-ass movie.It's clear why Quentin Tarantino, an obvious cinephile, fell in love with this movie and decided to pay homage to it with his car chase film "Death Proof." Because "Vanishing Point" above all else is supremely cinematic. It's a film about movement -- our protagonist is never content to stand still, lest the demons chasing him catch up to him. And like him, the film never stands still either. It's kinetic and full of an angry and restless energy, and it's always compelling even if it doesn't always make sense.Barry Newman plays the tortured hero, Kowalski, looking like a cross between Mike Brady and Tim Roth. Cleavon Little is the blind d.j. who becomes a sort of guardian angel to Kowalski. And old-time character actor Dean Jagger has an unsettling cameo as a hermit living out in the desert wilds.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cool car chase picture, but more existential than you'd think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My impression going into Vanishing Point was that of a road-exploitation picture of the period. And thanks to movie-geek Tarantino Death Proof hyped up by having a kind of image-placement (ala yellow jump-suit in Kill Bill) that superimposed for those who hadn't seen it a sort of expectation. While I didn't quite get the mother of all car-crash pictures- there are a few, don't get it wrong- it is a pretty interesting work of its times. It doesn't get nearly deep enough with its main character as some symbolic point of a fall from grace from authority or of disillusionment with the period, but it's somehow still a cool little movie. There's a feeling that something is going on underneath, the subtext to the whole facet of speed that a person takes (uppers) going along with a kind of car ride that Dr. Gonzo would probably not attempt. At the same time Barry Newman fills in the role as enigmatically as possible; we're never totally sure what this guy's motive is to go for broke in delivering a car across states to a little s***-hole town at 100 miles an hour, which makes it part of the fun.It's a high-stakes story of daring cop-chases, detour through a desert, help from strangers, and a fatalistic ending that seems more bizarre and shocking than that of an Easy Rider. Not to say much for plot, though the writers do inject a strange co-plot (not quite sub-plot exactly) with a blind disc jockey, played by a spot-on Cleavon Little, who keeps tabs with Kowalsky as if he were an angel on his shoulder. The director also fashions out with a superb DP (who also worked on Chinatown) a good way making things not ever go too lighting paced or frenetic, but giving some level of breathing room of the open spaces, the long stretches of road, the desert, the rural towns, even Kowalski's face. And the sort of straightforward-but-not attitude to Kowalski's mission, in light of his history, adds to the thrills.If it's only a little disappointing it's that it hasn't aged as well as it should've. Maybe it's not exactly a fault- it's proud to be in the 70s, with moments of grass and that naked woman on the bicycle as indicators of a 'far-out' period- but, for example, should the rock and roll not always be a consistent point with the scenes? Some songs do stand out, and at times it's toe-tapping even, but not many. And the suddenness of the ending marks as almost a cop-out; it's just too easy a way to end the flick when it feels like a bigger climax awaits. Vanishing Point doesn't have dynamite storytelling, but it does have a dynamite attitude, positioning itself in the frame of a B-movie to make its mark with a terrific car and a bad-ass behind the wheel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(possible spoilers)this is a groundbreaking chase movie in my opinion. movies that followed, most starring Burt Reynolds and directed by Hal Needham, were comedies and this was a very good drama and came out years before the latter, more popular films. there is a scene where a song playing sounds so much like the theme for CANNONBALL RUN i was almost in shock. but enough comparisons... on it's own, VANISHING POINT is very good; at least the first 50 minutes. we get a chase, chase, chase, with camera angles unequaled in this genre. it's quite relaxing to watch even though it's pure action. but then after the driver pulls off the road and ventures into the center of the desert, and meets an old prospector and then visits a religious gathering and the picks up two gun-toting homosexuals and then meets a very nice motorcycle rider who has a shack and a very good looking, shirtless girlfriend, the movie begins to run out of gas - pun intended. but it's still a fun flick to watch - that is, to enjoy and relax to. most reviews i read center on Cleavon Little's role as a soul DJ who helps the driver along with his "plight" but personally, Cleavon, whom I loved in BLAZING SADDLES, over-acts to the hilt and is pretty darn annoying. but it's the first 50 minutes that really, really knocks my socks off - they should have kept the chase going because there were flashbacks during that chase and it worked wonderfully and didn't tire the eyes, or nerves, one bit. but, the characters that the driver meets after going into the center of the desert DO get tiring - and the story, tired. they should have stuck with the chase: chase, chase, chase... which does continue towards the end, and lasts for another ten minutes until the abrupt climax that will leave the viewer reminiscing EASY RIDER, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE, and even THELMA AND LOUISE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is kind of an odd little movie, featuring the relatively obscure Barry Newman as the driver of a 1970 Dodge Challenger, who has made a bet that he can deliver this vehicle from Denver to San Francisco in 15 hours. Naturally, the various local highway patrols take exception to him accomplishing this feat, and ... the chase is on! We have a little bit of Easy Rider and a little bit of Sugarland Express mixed here with a sprinkle of Bullit and 'Bandit' for seasoning.Flashbacks that are way too short are inserted to give us some insight into the character of Kowalski (Newman), and they serve to explain little. Newman displays the acting skill of a stick, and encounters characters who are all stereotypes: 'Cranky Old Wilderness Guy' (see Jeremiah Johnson), sexually liberated naked flower child, white racist country music types, sympathetic blind black guy, bumbling cops, etc. Particularly annoying is the usually enjoyable Cleavon Little as the blind DJ trying to help Kowalski.In the end, in the UK version, Charlotte Rampling is employed to play a cadaverous hitch hiker (Death?), who Kowalski makes love to and then, of course, must race to a blazing suicidal crash.Is this movie harmful? No. It passes its 97 minutes (UK) mildly entertaining. But the let down at the end has you asking, "What was that all about?"</fullReview>

You see some slightly strange looking guy driving around, meeting characters seemingly taken straight from a bad comic book with totally artificial and unbelievable dialog, plus whacked out sequences apparently written while being high on heaven knows what. Worst of all was the black DJ - incredibly annoying.And the car chases weren't that impressive either, especially compared to other movies of that era. Most of the time the cars were going pretty slow with the impression of speed achieved through various tricks. This is common today but it wasn't back then. I would've expected at least a few short scenes with the Dodge going 100-150 mph, speeds I regularly drive on the Autobahn. Cuts and special camera angles are not a substitute if you know the real thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot. Simple. A man who tried to fit in (Kowalski played enigmatically by underrated actor Barry Newman) finally has it and decides to just point a social finger at "the man" and race his car cross country for some speed. (Talk about your obvious metaphors, but hey, the point is made.) This can be viewed as a chase movie but then you would most likely be as unsatisfied as some of the people who thought this movie sucked. Well, I have said countless times, "it sucks" can never be construed as "constructive criticism." Anyway, add a blind D.J. named Super Soul (another underrated actor, Cleavon Little) making a point to the consternation of some redneck yahoos, a naked blonde in the desert, assorted counterculture types (I always hated that term, but I use it here just for the sake of clarity and not having to type too much) and you have a quirky movie that works on many levels IF YOU LIVED THROUGH THE SIXTIES or at the very least, have a "guide" of sorts who did.Okay. Time for a brief history lesson.The Nixon metaphor. If you know about the 1960s, you know that there were many student protests against the war and against forms of corporate racism, sexism and just about anything that the Nixon "Silent Majority" detested. Most of us did not have the power of the vote because then, you had to be 21 to use that power then. (In my own case, having a December birthday, it wouldn't have mattered anyway since I would not be 18 until AFTER the presidential election. But I digress) We young folkies had no real say, and Nixon beat us into the ground, which culminated, albeit indirectly, with the Kent State killings, the death of some Black Panthers and basically shutting us the hell up to disco our butts into the ground. What a waste! But we had movies like this to make us think, or, at the very least, to have discussions and write our own damn movies in our heads, or just in our b.s. We had an outlet, small though it may have been. But, film is forever, and this one, with its trappings of sex, drugs and rock and roll, gave us a good time all around.So, for those of you who say, "Hey! Leave the analyzing out of this," you can't. If you do that, this movie has nothing. Yes, enjoy it by all means, but see what it says or make your own judgments as to what Kowalski was all about and who represented what.Now, there are some serious car guys talking about this flick, and I confess that I know nothing about cars except that they have tires and motors and take you from point A to point B. Hell, I didn't even drive until well after I got out of the military, but I did do a helluva lot of hitchhiking, and never tried to hurt a driver like the guys in this flick. Still, I am grateful to the intense info on automotives given by so many of you reviewers here.And just for the record, don't waste time with the pathetic remake of this one. If you can't even have the decency of a naked blonde on screen (Yeah, I know the other one was a TV flick and they couldn't do that. All the more reason not to remake the thing on the small screen.) "Vanishing Point" is a vital record of a time gone by and we seem to be reliving in some small way now under the current regime...I mean...administration.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Kowalski, our speeding hero in the cool white car smiles as he "vanishes" but actually crashes and burns into the barricades while several of his new fans look on. I was confused by the vanishing when I first saw this film at age 20, but it's really simple if you use your gray matter. The man wanted to vanish and escape a worthless existence and in his mind, at least, that's what he did. Vanished! Similar endings have been done in films like "Thelma And Louise" and they made just as much sense - or nonsense. I didn't always like such endings, but here it is the only way to go. It worked! Enjoy the movie!And that's a wrap!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think I only "got" half of it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd often heard about this movie from the muscle car fan world. And when it comes to muscle cars, a lot of this film lives up to its billing as a spectacular car chase movie. This film delivers cubic inches of muscle car action, as Kowalski (Barry Newman) jumps his '70 Dodge Challenger across washouts, dices with a trashy looking Jaguar, and battles the police on and off the road, all the while wearing a rather disturbed expression. Great stuff. Unfortunately, the film uses up most of its gas and rubber in the first hour, and the rest seems to be about Kowalski's interaction with the various characters he meets on the road.Unfortunately, this is where I don't really get the movie. Some of the characters are pretty straightforward, but most of the people Kowalski meets are mid-bogglingly weird. People show up, say their part, and disappear for the rest of the movie, leaving the viewer to try and make sense of the things they've said. The movie's sense of pacing doesn't help much - it seems to be a bit off many times, and often there is no sense of tension where there ought to be. And sometimes the film suggested something terrible was going to happen... and then nothing occurred. To its credit, though, the very unpredictability of the supporting cast can really keep you on your toes. There were quite a few times when the action took a twist that there was no way I could have expected.I guess I don't really get all the existentialism behind this film. The chase scenes do get the adrenaline flowing, but I found a lot of the film could sometimes border on the unwatchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting counter-culture movie that isn't strong enough to be a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot? Ha! There's this guy driving real fast. He's Kowalski and he's a bit enigmatic. He's basically delivering a car to a customer and is trying to do it in a record time. He starts getting chased by cops and what ensues is a hectic counter-culture road race/chase movie across the US. Think `Easy Rider' with one man and a car.Kowalski is naturally enigmatic. We don't know much about him and why he's taking these insane risks with his life and freedom. Gradually, over the course of the movie, we get to learn more about him through flashbacks and his interactions with the crazy kooky people he meets up. Yup, the country appears dotted with bizarre weirdoes, including naked bicycle chicks and snake capturing old men. Why? No idea, and it doesn't matter too much. This movie is a journey, with a stranger who we come to respect (although never really know), and we're along for the ride..Acting's not up to much. Barry Newman, as Kowalski, looks the part - moody, and intense. He has very few lines, and that suits the character's obscure nature. The only real character of any other significance is Super Soul, a blind radio DJ mysteriously assisting Kowalski over the airwaves. He too is enigmatic - his motives unclear, etc. As such his acting seems to limit itself to dancing in his seat, flinging his arms about and yelling. Hmmm. In other movies that would earn my ridicule, but for some reason it works here.The movie looks well. Yes, it's obviously rooted in early '70s counter-culture, but it has a very firm feel to it, a sense of identity (somewhat ironic, considering its meta-themes concerning the lone faceless individual). Director Richard S. Sarafian employs a variety of camera shots in the movie to keep the audience entertained throughout the choice. There's also an excellent soundtrack, which can only be labelled as `cool'. It perfectly matches the mood and temper of Kowalski. It's qualities like these that help disguise the flimsy nature of the movie.`Vanishing Point' is `different'. It's enjoyable but alas it's also pretty substance less - pretty but with no real padding underneath. You can be driven along and admire the pretty pictures and sheer vibes it emanates, but you'll be left wanting if you seek any real depth. Still it's better than the over-rated `Easy Rider'. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Whole Lot of WTF</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expected a modern classic, but what a let down. The whole thing was a long, rather mediocre car chase. Here's a guy who supposed deliver a car (one would assume, intact) driving through the desert, off road, etc. I don't think the car was stolen (or maybe it was, whatever...), however the plot of getting to San Francisco in 15 hours on a bet with a small time speed dealer didn't make sense. The only thing that kept me awake was the naked girl on motorcycle. Even the car chase sequences were bland. If you're looking for a car chase movie from that era, try Bullit or The French Connection. Maybe I'm missing the whole 'Lone Wolf/Rebel' bit, I dunno. I realize this was a drive-in/B Movie, however Vanishing Point seemed like a pointless exercise in WTF.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe good in 1971 but we're in 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well first of all it's not a thriller.It's just a movie about a guy driving fast from point A to point B. The whole movie is nothing else then that. I can imagine that in 1971 this movie would have score high rankings but we are in 2016 now so I watched it with my mind being in 2016. And so my ratings are not good for Vanishing Point. I was going to score it a five, but because of the end that I didn't like it dropped a point. If you are a fan of American muscle cars, or more specifically a Dodge Challenger in this case then you might like Vanishing Point. Or if you are a fan of the music from that time then you might like it as well. But for the rest, the story is just weak and quite ridiculous. Maybe in that time the driver would not have been caught for so long, but in 2016 he would not make it for more then 50 miles. It's like the police in the seventies are retarded. Add on that some hippies in the desert, some gays hitchhiking, a nude hippie chick on a Honda in the desert and that's the whole story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inscrutable, existential early 70's car-chase flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1971, "Vanishing Point" stars Barry Newman as Kowalski, a pill-popping former racer and police officer, who bets that he can deliver a supercharged car from Denver to San Francisco in 15 hours. The police in four states try to apprehend him as a DJ (Cleavon Little) supports him on the airwaves. Dean Jagger plays a geezer Kowalski runs into in the desert.This is a cult flick about the adventures of a rebel without a cause. While it has similarities to 1969's "Easy Rider," it's not as compelling and the subtext isn't as good (see my review of "Easy Rider").The story is a big middle finger to what was called "the establishment" at a time when the Vietnam War was making a wreck of America's social cohesion. Kowalski was part of that establishment when he was a cop, but became disillusioned after he exposed corruption and was punished for it, but heralded by the counterculture. Kowalski had seen the underbelly of the "pig" and didn't want to be part of it. At the beginning he drives off the road and you see him looking at some derelict vehicles. He increasingly realizes HE is a derelict on the side of the road with nowhere to go. What better next stop than oblivion? The climax is his *beep* off moment to go out on HIS terms. Three years later "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry" sorta ripped it off. While that movie lacks the interesting (and ambiguous) subtext of "Vanishing Point," it's a more compelling watch. Despite the many car chases, "Vanishing Point" is surreal and even languid, embellished by a listless score (e.g the opening) and acid rock tracks throughout; while I don't like the former, most of the latter tracks are good and fit the ambiance of the movie.Then there's the naked blond on the motorcycle sequence. Someone incredulously asked: "How could he possibly turn down a sexy naked blonde? What's his problem?!" I guess sexiness is in the eye of the beholder because I didn't find her all that sexy. Sure, she has a pretty face, but her body is nearly as un-curvy as a 12 year-old girl. But some guys prefer thinner women and that's cool; to each his own. In addition, Kowalski was still grieving over his true love. Moreover, the naked blond didn't play the game of seduction, which takes time and imagination. Instead she prematurely throws her entire hand on the table and it simply doesn't turn Kowalski on. Lastly, despite it being the "free love" era (1970), Kowalski was much older (and arguably nobler) than the average hippie; as such, he didn't feel it proper to take advantage of the mate of the guy who was selflessly helping him (at least not without his clear permission).The movie runs 99 minutes and was shot in Colorado, Utah, Nevada and Arizona.GRADE: B- COMMENTARY ON THE MEANING ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie) In an interview Barry Newman very seriously explained Kowalski's actions at the end: "He thought he could make it through; and that was the reason for the smile just prior to the impact." I don't question this since the actor himself would have more insights about the movie than the viewer, but even his answer is ambiguous. It could mean (and probably does) that Kowalski thought he could make it through to the other side, i.e. leave the physical plane for the spiritual one and the (possible) freedom thereof. After all, he sees "the light" between the blades of the bulldozers while approaching. Keep in mind that Kowalski was hopped up on a lot of drugs. As such, he doesn't commit suicide in the sense he wants to die, but rather kills himself in the accident because he BELIEVES he'll make it through; physically or spiritually, it doesn't matter. He believed.</fullReview>

But cause of the way its put together, it's sadly only mildly entertaining. I dunno if the importance of the backstory on kowalski ended on the cutting room floor, or it was put together this way on purpose. But The back story comes in minor flashback sequences, and I think they are suppose to be relevant in terms of getting to know the background of our antihero.For me it just doesn't work,cause they have skipped too much on how he got be where he is, when you meet him.Some of the scenes in the movie are really confusing at times. For instance when he could have avoided a roadblock by simply going around them,he flee from them instead.While other times he simply do just that,drive around them And you never know why it was so important to get the car to Sand Francisco.There are a lot of hinting or implying that girls he meet have some sort of connection to he's past,but they never really clarify it.Is it just that they remind him of someone he once had a connection with,or are they the girls from the past he sees in he's flashback?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pure cult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I never came across this flick until a friend of my dropped in a few weeks ago telling me to see this flick if you do love muscle cars because the main lead is a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T. Do loving muscle cars I thought to give it a try but after a few minutes I knew that this was a must see.Just watch how this was shot and just listen to the music, only that makes it worth watching. The story itself isn't really that important. Bring a car from point A to B. We do learn a bit about the driver Kowalski (Barry Newman) and his past but it's really the car that makes the movie. Naturally being made early 70's it were the heydays of the muscle cars and you will see a lot of them. Maybe one reason that this flick isn't that much spoken of is the fact that it doesn't include a Ford Mustang but don't worry, the sound and power of the Dodge will deliver.What you see throughout this flick are teams that can't be done nowadays. The racism used towards the end is what really happened back then but nowadays you watch it with open mouth. But it was also the moment of the hippies and free sex and you will see nudity here and there. Naturally drugs are involved too. It will remind you of the other classic Easy Rider (1969) only here we don't have that much of deep story. It shows America as it was back then. I've seen it on restored Blu Ray and it looked stunning with excellent 5.1, you can here the car all over your room. This is pure cult and did stand time, only to wish for that those cars were still here with all their character and sound in stead of the trash being made nowadays.

Expected it to be nothing more than a revhead movie, but it is far better than that.More like Easy Rider on four wheels. A movie about freedom and individuality. Good script, but it is the direction and the setting that makes this movie great. Richard Sarafian sketches Kowalski's character through flashbacks and delivered information, showing you why he is doing what he is doing. The ending is perfect.Barry Newman hardly had much dialogue, but in playing Kowalski he defined anti-authoritarian freedom-loving figures forever.</fullReview>

Thoughts about the Counter Culture, the Vietnam War, Drugs, Nudity, and the Difficult Existence of an Anti Establishment Entity Trying to Survive in a Conservative Society.This is a Muscle Car Movie for the Cerebral Type. The Cross Country Chase and the Driving are Intercut with the Anti-Hero's Encounters with Various Characters on the Edge. This does Nothing to Take Away from the Hook of the Movie that is the Car, the Driver, and the Pursuit.The Weakest Part is the Overly Obnoxious African-American DJ who is Placed in a Country and Western Town with His Radio Rap of Soul Fired Frenzy. Like the Driver, He is a Fish Out of Water. But the Connection, both Psychic and on the Radio with Barry Newman's Kowalski is just too Obvious and Contrived for it to Amount to Much and there is Quite a bit of it.Overall, this Cult Movie Deserves its Reputation. A Great Looking and Edited, Movie with an Appropriate and Sometimes Very Effective Soundtrack make this Low-Budget Winner an Artifact of its Time that Comfortably can be Placed with the Other Iconic Films from the Counter Culture of the Era Displaying the Zeitgeist with some Intelligence, Creativity, and Style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast Cars and Misfits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit I wasn't sure quite what to make of this one when I first saw it. I had to view it more than once, and other user reviews actually gave me some insight (thanks everybody). What drew me to Vanishing Point in the first place was that it was a road flick featuring a fast car..and I LOVE movies with fast cars.The premise at the beginning seems simple enough. Kowalski (Barry Newman) is a speed freak (as in drugs AND driving) who makes his living delivering cars. He's just arrived back in Denver, to the place that employs him, after a delivery, and wants to head right back out on the road again to deliver a Dodge Challenger to San Francisco. His boss pleads with him to get some rest, as does his drug dealer, but Kowalski is determined. He bets his dealer the price of the speed he just bought that he can deliver the car in 15 hours (I figured it up..he would have to average 84.5 MPH with NO stops if he drove in a straight line).Where the movie gets interesting..and disturbing..is when it gets into WHY Kowalski is so determined to go on this ride. While he's tearing down the roadway in that waaay cool white Challenger, with police hot on his tail, we see flashes of his past, including his time as a war hero in Vietnam, his stint as a police officer who stops his partner from raping a teenage girl they'd picked up; also we see that for a time he raced cars and motorcycles (crashing more than once), and he even spent a period of time as a hippie/counterculture type (where he watched his girlfriend drown in the ocean). Two dynamics emerge: First, and this was brought up in another review, Kowalski is a guy who couldn't fit in anywhere, be it the "establishment" or the "counterculture." Second, and more important, in the flashbacks we see one bad thing after another happen to him, regardless of what he was doing or who he was with. This is what his life has come down to, and it's as if this pedal-to-the-metal trip to SF, come hell or high water, is all he has left.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the other main player in this, a blind disc jockey who goes by "Super Soul" (Cleavon Little in what may be the finest performance of his career). Super Soul feels an instant connection with Kowalski..calling him "the last American hero" as he races from police on his trek. In between songs he talks to Kowalski over the airwaves as if he can sense what the doomed driver is thinking. In the midst of this a bunch of redneck bullies break into the radio station and give Super Soul a horrific beating, and the movie doesn't really explain why. Maybe it's because they didn't like what Kowalski was doing and Super Soul being sympathetic to him, aggravated by the fact that they already hated Super Soul because he was black.This movie has been compared, erroneously in my opinion, to Easy Rider. Whereas the latter is clearly a movie centering on the 60s counterculture, Vanishing Point is a character study, both of Kowalski and Super Soul, two misfits..yet both honorable and decent men(perhaps that's what makes them misfits)..who seem doomed to never really belong anywhere. It's also a sort of requiem for the days gone by for fast cars and open roads in America. This is not a pleasant movie..it's dark, depressing and surreal..but interesting. And Kowalski drives one VERY cool..and fast..car.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just an exciting car chase movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Vanishing Point when it was first released in the seventies. It is in re-play now on Sundance possibly because of the recent death of it's director. When first released it was an immediate counter-culture hit. Yes, the chase sequences are exciting and well-done, but the context may be difficult for younger viewers to get. It is shown in flashbacks that the anti-hero Kowalski is a decorated but disaffected Vietnam vet and former cop, who prevents another policeman from raping a suspect, a beautiful young girl, and is then discharged from the force. He then becomes a stunt driver and high- speed car delivery driver. He is part of a generation of people who felt betrayed by a corrupt system and were angry, very angry. He is protesting against the system with his 'I don't give a f**k' attitude despite his cool demeanor. That's what resonated with young film-goers in the seventies and why it remains a cult classic. /Frank</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An arguably superior reworking of Easy Rider</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very, very interesting film, you really can't watch it and not seriously consider buying a Dodge Challenger and taking off across the western US afterwards (certainly Top Gear's Richard Hammond does). In Easy Rider we had the bikers who were still open to the future and all its' possibilities. Vanishing Point is a much more cynical film, its' hero is actually an establishment figure, a decorated war veteran (presumably he must have been an adviser to the South Vietnamese military in the early 60s as regular US forces weren't deployed until 1965), a cop, a surfer and professional racer. But he seems to have become disillusioned with it and arguably with the 60s counter-culture as well. In some ways this is the longest suicide note in history (and arguably one of the failings of the film is it is slightly too long). We never know WHY he makes his epic drive, perhaps he is haunted by his inner demons and cannot simply bare to sit still any more, as long as he keeps moving they cannot catch him. It seems a little trite that he causes all this damage but never actually harms anyone. That the police are chasing him purely for his speeding but they're still right to do so, the law must be enforced for the good of all and perhaps that's what both Kowalksi and Soul Superstar realise at the last. Some interesting touches, the warning sign saying 'Stop' as he tears out of Denver, the fact that when his drug dealer asks him what he wants he just replies 'Speed'.An entertaining film which defines its' era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vanishing Point is quite a flawed movie in conventional terms - but it is interesting and intriguing partially for that reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vanishing Point is a difficult film to assess in many ways. As a movie, it is quite flawed. The plot is obvious but ultimately quite shallow - centering around Kowalski trying to deliver a car across the country in record time. Kowalski's back story is hinted at, which makes the film a bit more interesting, but his back story takes up only a few minutes of the film. The characters and performances are often vacuous, failing to leave an impression. Barry Newman is the chief culprit, turning in a most colourless, emotionless performance where he personally offers little insight into his character. The exception is Cleavon Little as the hyperactive DJ Super-Soul; his interplay with Newman is novel, some of his dialogue is memorable (indeed, his rambling about Kowalski and the 'police Nazis' was quoted by Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses twenty years later) and his input gives the film some badly needed impetus. Luckily though, Vanishing Point works better on other levels. For instance, it has that early 1970's style that makes the film more compelling than it should be. Newman is chiefly responsible for this; he is certainly emotionless, but that allows him to develop an air of 'cool' that suits the film. The white Dodge Challenger is a very nice touch. The early 70's style also allows it to work as a period piece; Kowalski encounters counter-culture hippies, religious fanatics in the desert and the police. The fractious state of race relations between blacks and whites at that time is also highlighted. On the downside, it does substantially date the film. It's a cult classic for a reason; as the failed 1997 remake demonstrated, a movie like Vanishing Point would not work nearly as well in another era.It also works reasonably well as a straight driving film. The film is punctuated with enough car crashes and chases to move the film forward.However, the film's real saving grace is in its many allegories. The largely empty plot does ironically enable this, because you can read whatever you want into the film. I therefore understand why the plot is so empty, because the many allegories punctuated within the film make it intriguing to watch. For instance, why did Kowalski's face shine towards the end? Why were there so many STOP signs? Was Super-Soul a spiritual guide to Kowalski? You can also have fun inventing allegories that weren't even intended - why was the Dodge Challenger white, for example?Ultimately, Vanishing Point is not the easiest film to assess. In conventional terms, I would not rank the film particularly highly because the plot, characters, acting and dialogue are often unimpressive. As such, the casual movie viewer may not particularly identify with it. However, Vanishing Point is not a particularly conventional film; like most good films it moves itself forward well, but it is the film's style and allegorical nature that largely keeps the interest and pushes the film above the ruck of many other driving movies. I also admit that the film could not have been as effective as an allegory if the plot wasn't so insubstantial. With this in mind, I have decided to give it:3.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kowalski's Last Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Richard C. Sarafian's rampaging road epic "Vanishing Point" qualifies as one of the seminal counterculture melodramas of the early 1970s. This careening car chase between a car delivery driver in a creamy white Dodge Challenger and the authorities in three states constitutes an existential commentary about race relations, morality, and freedom. "Vanishing Point" amounts to "Easy Rider" on four wheels. Basically, Kowalski makes a wager with his African-American speed dealer that he can take a car from Denver, Colorado, to San Francisco, California, in 15 hours. This deceptively simple saga scrutinizes the life of our hero in flashback as he sets out to deliver a car and emerges as a media superstar before he dies in an explosive crash in the middle of nowhere. Between the time that he shows up to take delivery of the Challenger and he dies on the symbolic horns of two earth-moving bulldozers, Kowalski emerges as a patron saint of lost causes. He served in the U.S. Army, fought in Vietnam, and received a Medal of Honor. After the war, he became a cop, witnessed corruption first-hand, and got drummed out of the ranks because he refused to countenance corruption. He channeled his energies into racing motorcycles and automobiles until he took up delivering car and crunching on speed. Barry Newman plays Kowalski as a sympathetic but enigmatic character who refuses to take advantage of anybody, especially nubile women who throw themselves at him and offer him the both sex and drugs. He attracts all kinds of folks to his cause. An African-American radio disc jockey named 'Super Soul' at a remote radio station with call letters that could be interpreted as an abbreviation of its last name, free-spirited hippies with ample supplies of narcotics, and elderly adventurers flock to his side in supreme defiance of the law. Kowalski has a polarizing effect on the law. The good authorities realize that they can only cite him for recklessness driver. When they try to persuade two homosexuals who tried to rob him to swear out complaints against him, they refuse. Sarafian has called "Vanishing Point" a western about a lone rider, a champion of justice who refuses to knuckle under to an oppressive regime, literally a man heading west. Sarafian stages the story out in the wide open spaces of the sprawling American southwest and tells the story in flashbacks when our hero isn't barreling down one road or another, evening in the middle of the desert with cops on bikes, prowl cars, and helicopters in fast pursuit. Clearly, "Vanishing Point" provided the inspiration for "Two-Lane Blacktop," "The Sugarland Express," and "Smoky and the Bandit." What it lacks in depth, it makes up for with adrenaline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freedom is no longer typified as well as this rare jewel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barry Newman played his swan song long before he stumbled into TV celebrity. At least those of us who met him first on the long road to California in 1971 are concerned. As TV's Petrocelli, like Gilligan before him, perhaps hard to shake off the stigma of an over emphasized character, few were to ever again to remember his honest and steadfast portrayals of the charismatic characters he played in 49 other films. If pigeonholed into the iconic role of "Kowalski", Colorado plate, OA5599" in David Sarafian's timeless and mournful Vanishing Point has never-less become his legacy, NO ONE could have been Kowalski better. For lovers of this film he is forever carved into memory as the enigmatic character that screenwriter Malcom Hart intended him to be...Through the eyes "Supersoul" (Cleavon Little):"And there goes the Challenger, being chased by the blue, blue meanies on wheels."The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver, the last American hero, the electric Shinta, the demigod, the super driver of the Golden West."Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind the beautiful lone driver, the police numbers are getting' closer, closer, closer to our soul hero in his soul-mobile."Yeah, baby. They're about to strike. They're gonna get him, smash him, rape the last beautiful, free soul on this planet. But, it is written:"If the evil spirit arms the tiger with claws, Brahman provided wings for the dove." Thus spake the super guru."Perhaps there is much to learn by re-examining this 70's Hemi version of Kwai Chang Caine...or perhaps not. Still, for those who were young enough to have seen this film splattered into the flickering light of drive-in theatre ,it will always stick to the memory. A test of one's self. Could any of us ever know the freedom of Kowalski's effortless surrender?http://www.edtruthan.com/vp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There might have been a point (like back in the early Seventies when this film came out) when I would have considered a picture like this a monumental waste of time. I was merely twenty then, and the idea of racing across the countryside didn't present to me the kind of thing that would be worth doing, never mind watching it take place on a movie screen for an hour and a half. But just like a lot of films, this isn't so much about what's happening on screen as much as it is about what's happening inside the head of it's protagonist. Barry Newman's Kowalski wasn't a loser, he had been a part of civil society for about as long as forging a career made any sense at all. However when events in his life began to blur the edges of sanity, he decided to reverse course and turn completely the other way.Equating speed with freedom of the soul, and with a sense of the blind leading the blind (Cleavon Little as 'Super Soul'), "Vanishing Point" does make IT's point - a life half realized isn't worth living at all. All metaphorical of course, as suicide does have a way of removing any other options, but still, the message is in choosing how one will live. Grittily explored here with stark desert landscapes, red-neck racists and unimaginable delights riding in on a motorcycle, one can't help re-evaluating this message flick from almost forty years ago for what it's worth, a rebellious slap in the face of conformity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film. It does what a film should do. It creates it own little world and takes you for a ride. The film is really about being a glorious loser. Kowalski, the hero, is a failure. He's a Vietnam War vet ? from a very disillusioned early 70's perspective anyone involved in that conflict is a loser. He's a failed police officer (incidentally it says he was a detective ? does a detective wear a uniform? He does if he's loser). He's a failure in love ? his girlfriend dies in a bizarre surfing accident while he rests on the shore. He's a failed racing driver although his friend would have the world believe he was the best only he never won anything. He's a failed gambler ? can't even win his bet to drive his car to San Francisco due to an unfortunate bulldozer incident. He's a failure in friendship and morality. His best friend (the one he makes his last telephone call to) is a drug dealer. Remember Kowalski used to be a constable. He knows the damage drugs can do. So we see him at one point protecting a girl from rape and in the next discussing girls with his drug dealer mate. Speaking of women - there he is in the middle of the desert all alone with a beautiful naked woman who offers him anything he wants but he can't think of anything! Loser. In the end the film asks did America fail Kowalski or did Kowalski fail himself?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great chase movie and character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vanishing Point gives us the story of Kowalski, a former professional race driver now working as a driver delivering cars across the desert of the American west. He makes a bet with his friend he can deliver his latest car to San Francisco in a ridiculously short amount of time and hits the road at a breakneck pace. When the cops first try to pull him over for speeding, he refuses, and an epic chase is on.At first the film seems to be a mindless action flick with our hero using spectacular driving to elude his pursuers. However, as the movie progresses, we begin to get details about Kowalski's life. He's a Vietnam vet and presumably saw some terrible things in combat during the war. At one time he was a police officer, only to be disgraced in a public scandal. The only woman he ever loved, perhaps the only person who gave him a reason to go on, drowned in a surfing accident. His career as a racer was a dismal failure.He's lead a difficult life and we begin to question his motivations for taking the bet. Why risk everything, even his life, to win a ridiculous wager with a friend? What's the point in delivering a car if it's practically destroyed? It becomes clear that Kowalski doesn't really care if he destroys the car, or even himself, during his journey. He's a man who's reached the end of his rope. He's lived life on the edge of society and it has taken a terrible toll on him. His fiery, suicidal crash at the conclusion of the film is not all that surprising. He knew all along this would be his final drive.The simplistic plot of the film is bolstered by the many quirky characters he meets along the way. There's a blind DJ, an eccentric old man wandering the desert, gay highway robbers, a naked motorcycle girl, a Christian snake-handling cult... These characters all add texture to an already rich story. Given the minimal dialog he had to work with, Barry Newman gives a great understated performance as Kowalski. This is the story of one man's death, but it is also a story about a dying part of America. Wide-open roads in the West, unlimited possibilities and idealism, the dream of making it to California... all of these things disappeared decades ago.This is a great 70's cult classic. While some aspects of the film seem dated, Vanishing Point is still more creative and progressive than many movies being produced now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 Perspectives from 1 Reviewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most difficult film of the dozens that I have rated on IMDb.First Perspective: I first saw this film on its initial release when I was an incipient hippie- wannabe of 17. My first car had been a Chevelle SS 396, and my second was a Firebird 400. I was accustomed to driving long distances across the arid southwest at high rates of speed. Just something you did... So, on first viewing, I loved this film and its celebration of the anti- violent, anti-racist, anti-establishment milieu of the 60's counter-culture. I loved the soundtrack. I loved the familiar scenery. I loved the car and the adrenaline rush that it provided. I loved the anti-hero, Kowalski, and I expected Barry Newman to become a big star. (He starred in a short-lived TV drama, "Petrocelli," but portrayed minor characters for most of his film career.) No doubt, I also loved the rather extensive nudity.Years later, I still remembered Newman, the title of the film, and the basic theme of pursuit, but beyond that I could not recall why I had such a fond memory of this film.Second Perspective: I watched it for only the second time last night when I stumbled across it on one of the movie channels. So, I sat down and became a passenger on a personal road-trip of nostalgic curiosity. Mostly, I thought, "I don't really get it, but it is kind of interesting" - primarily for making me aware of a personal milieu that I had so internalized that I had long since stopped regarding it as very distinctive in any way. The anti-racism and anti-violence themes seemed pretty stereotypical and obligatory in a film of this kind. It was never clear to me why so many (mostly impassive) people would gather around the radio station and continue to hang out for a couple of days. I sat through the whole movie with a sense of how preposterous it was that Super Soul just turned the radio station into his own personal CB to talk to Kowalski. When it ended, I thought, "I wonder what the point was - an extended car chase movie? If a point had ever been in mind, surely it had vanished... Oh, I get it... Boy, a long way to go to make a non-point!"Third Perspective: A day after seeing the movie for the second time, I turned to IMDb to see what others thought. I was quite surprised by the high rating and the number of reviews. I began to read them. Many of the positive comments I read, drug me out of my middle-aged literalistic perspective and restored my appreciation for this film and the kind of film-making it represents. It is a quest movie - the quest for freedom - and we see that in multiple characters. It is not literal, but metaphorical - symbolic to some degree, stereotypical to some degree. (But, one man's stereotype is another man's symbol.) In the context of surrealism, a car radio that talks to its driver is actually rather interesting. During the era of "Vanishing Point," Hollywood made a number of very self-conscious, pseudo-intellectual attempts at depicting the contemporary culture. Most of these attempts that I have revisited in recent years are at best, laughable, and at worst, painful to watch. But this one is neither. It avoids striking that pretentious, consciously "hip" tone that caused its contemporaries to age so poorly.In the end, the movie achieves a curious balance. Did I like Kowalski? Yes. Was I saddened when he crashed? No. Despite the character-developing flash-backs, Kowalski was transformed from a real person with whom I might identify into some metaphor or symbol about whom I was quite dispassionate. I was merely along for an exciting ride, the end of which did not cause me the slightest bit of anticipation or suspense. Kind of like a carnival ride...My values have changed a lot since I first saw this film. I cannot accept the existentialism and nihilism that are the film's main themes. Despite the fact that these are the themes of the film, however, Vanishing Point never seems really dark or oppressive or depressing or polemical. The soundtrack is terrific and lively, providing a counterbalance to the dark themes. The racial violence is disturbing. But most of the nudity actually seemed quite "innocent" - even if the nude rider was an obvious symbol of freedom (or the pursuit of freedom). (Interestingly, a kind of denial of existentialism and the ethos of the era comes about when Newman declines the nude rider's implicit invitation to sex and her offer of marijuana.) Vanishing Point is absolutely remarkable for the almost complete absence of offensive language. None of the commentators I read seem to have grasped that. Almost every Hollywood film that ever portrayed the milieu portrayed in Vanishing Point (or, in fact, any anti-hero film since the release of this film) has relied on heavy doses of profanity. I submit this film as powerful evidence that such language is, indeed, gratuitous and unnecessary.After my first viewing of this film, I might have rated it higher than a 7. Immediately after my last viewing, I probably would have rated this film somewhat lower. After reading some other comments, I think it's overall rating on IMDb is about right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the comments I've read about this movie I find I seem to be the only one who noticed (or the only one who actually thinks it's important): there is no mention of the beginning scenes while the opening credits are rolling. These scenes begin as the same as the ending scenes (when the bad stuff happens), but instead of driving to his "conclusion" Kowalski does a U-turn, drives down a side road and escapes. While driving away the frame freezes, then slow-motions forward and his car disappears. I'm not any kind of philosopher or existentialist but I believe this is the actual meaning to the film's title, Vanishing Point. I believe it has something to do with cheating fate, etc.</fullReview>

It was also nice to see this on cable, where they included the part with the naked girl on the bike.Anyway, at the end of the movie, while Kowalski is about to crash into the bulldozers, a song is being sung. It seems to be Delaney and Bonnie singing......and then Kowalski crashes...the song goes on until the end...

		<shortDescription>Not just motor pulp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What may seem at first to be just so much car stunt schlock turns out actually to be a rather fascinating meditation on motivation. Barry Newman is great as Kowalski, a sketchy character who drives cars cross-country. We learn little about him, and only slowly and in jumbled bits, as he tries to deliver a white Challenger from Denver to San Francisco. Starting out Friday at nearly midnight, Kowalski tries to do the run by Saturday at 3 o'clock for unspecified reasons?the car doesn't have to be there until Monday, and we're given to understand that Kowalski is really running away from his screwed-up life. Newman looks right as the present-day, haggard Kowalski, yet is perfect as the fresh-faced uniformed cop he was in his youth and the car and motorcycle racer he was after he fell from grace.What could have been monotonous driving-and-thinking or mind-numbing crash after crash is deftly handled by director Sarafian in a balanced mix of stunts and interludes. Cleavon Little does most of Kowalski's talking for him as the exuberant DJ Super Soul, but Newman owns the screen, reacting subtly to the lunatic world he's passing thru and barely a part of anymore. Some of the music is pretty lame 70s hippie rock, which is too bad, since a great soundtrack probably would have elevated this to true classic status.The DVD includes both the US and UK releases, the difference being a brief sequence in which Kowalski picks up Charlotte Rampling as a mysterious hitchhiker. This is a little too on-the-nose for my taste and seems to be aping Ingmar Bergman, but the movie plays fine with or without it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best chase movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin: I'll admit, this is not for everybody. It is for people who enjoy films instead of movies. Films that raise questions and make you think. Based in the exciting 70s, this is about a car driver who, on a whim, bets that he can make it from Denver to San Fransisco in 15 hours. He loads up on speed and heads west. In the raging spirit of the 70s, the same spirit that accompanied Easy Rider and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, he races against the law for what is right; what this reviewer believes is the American Dream. He is helped along the way by an apparently psychic radio DJ, a naked girl on a motorcycle (one of the most beautiful and purely free images I have ever seen), a hippie, along with several other miscreants that the society at the time considered bad. The story is as much about the rebellion and the characters he meets on the way as it is the chase itself. The film manages to beautifully capture every facet of the experience, from the monotony of the drive to the excitement of the chase to the fear of defeat.So, for those looking for what is perhaps the ultimate chase movie, this is it. But more so, this film is for those looking for inspiration into (or perhaps, remembrance of) the American Dream in a society where it was still possible.</fullReview>

I could almost swear that I saw a different ending at that time than the one that is now on the film. The one I saw was as Newman is approaching the town and bulldozer road block he just suddenly disappear. They wait for him to come up the road but it never happens. the cops and copters just can't find him. He goes into a different dimension. Thus the title of the film Vanishing Point. He just reaches it finally. Did anyone else see that version. Or did my husband and I dream it up.

		<shortDescription>Iconic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe some films are easier to appreciate with the knowledge of hindsight. I only watched Vanishing Point after my curiosity was aroused by Tarantino's Death Proof. In Death Proof, one of the leading characters repeatedly hero-worships and refers to Vanishing Point's protagonist, Kowalski, who is a car delivery driver.The film was the inspiration for a number of rock music projects (such as an album by Primal Scream also called Vanishing Point). Its iconic status is also underlined by several remakes and references in film culture.My first objective was simply to experience the movie, the headlong rush, the adrenalin it created (or deficiency thereof). But I knew that afterwards I would want to ask why it had achieved a cult status. Our attitude of mind probably influences our film experience. In this case, prior knowledge maybe even opened me up to regarding it with a certain respect. Although I can think of other films where that has been the case and I have simply disagreed with the mainstream opinion. In the case of Vanishing Point, I feel my optimism was justified.Vanishing Point, which positions itself as a car chase involving "the maximum trip at the maximum speed," follows Kowalski across several state lines. He is trying to deliver a supercharged 1970 white Dodge Challenger from Denver, Colorado, to California. He takes some benzedrine and makes a bet with a local drug dealer on how fast he can reach his destination.Kowalski is able to outrun police cars. Not only is he driving a powerful car, but small flashbacks (augmenting largely minimalist dialogue) show that Kowalski has a professional racing background. What begins as a small pursuit over minor traffic violations becomes an interstate hunt out of all proportion.Flashbacks also pay testament to Kowalski's upright character - the very opposite of how is soon being portrayed by the police. An African-American DJ called Super Soul - Kowalski tunes to his radio station almost throughout - also builds our portrait of Kowalski. Super Soul, by tuning in to police broadcasts, is also able to give our intrepid driver tips to avoid capture.As verbal exchanges involving Kowalski - a man on a sort of mission - are so few, the image built by Super Soul is paramount. The DJ refers to car and driver with phrases like, "soul mobile" and "soul challenger" and says the cops are gonna, "rape the last beautiful free soul on this planet." Just hip talk from a fast-talking DJ? But whether we later choose to consider the building blocks that lead to this film's influence, the characters-as-archetypes factor has a force that also works on a subconscious level. Bear in mind this movie is set in 70s, post-Vietnam, post-Woodstock America. Amid growing disillusionment of government, advances in civil rights, and an atmosphere where many radical ideas of the 60's gain wider acceptance in mainstream life and culture.Characterisation of minor players is so vivid that there would be every tendency to interpret them symbolically. But they are always entertaining. From our almost psychic DJ, to a desert hobo who seems half-crazed, gay hitchhiker hoodlums, a biker who fashions Kowalski a 'pig pass (to fool a roadblock), or to the caring girlfriend - with blonde hair streaking behind her - as she traverses the desert nude on her motorbike.So how does Kowalski achieve an almost demi-god defining status? The use of language that is at once casual and symbolic is nothing new. But the substance has to come from the story itself. He has to become the archetype, much as god-kings of legend. His life has to become a symbol of all that he stands for. The beginning and ending of the film, when compared, provide these defining moments.The mystically inclined might like to ponder a phrase by the great philosopher Kant: "The transcendental subject is not an entity to be found or recognized within experience, but neither is it transcendent, altogether independent of experience; rather, it is like the vanishing point of a perspectival painting." Kant is referring to identity, personality, or 'soul'. Something that we know is actually there but which we can only define by what's around it.Our 'last American hero' has been clearly defined in the shape of Kowalski. He stands for himself - rather than country as suggested by the authority of the state. He is pitted against the hubris of a society that 'stood' for all the right things and then lost its way. Vanishing Point not only lauds great American values, it gives voice to the frustration of decent, freedom-loving citizens. Rebel-Without-A-Cause for grown-ups comes to mind! And the story is set in those memorable - symbolic if you will- open spaces and open roads of the American Golden West.Director Richard C. Sarafian said he wanted to make Kowalski appear outerworldly, and that the world within the film was a temporary existence. But the film doesn't force this on its audience. It can be enjoyed at a purely visceral level. It is an all-time great in terms of car pursuits, unencumbered by being the 'chase' add-on to another story. If the idea of rebellion doesn't appeal to you, it may seem a bit empty. But even then you may enjoy pondering the various meanings of the title.A totally different (if misleadingly appropriate) interpretation of the common phrase 'vanishing point' is given in a police rider-safety guide: "Find a good bend, it doesn't matter if it is to the right or to the left, and look for the point where the two verges appear to meet. This is the vanishing, or limit, point. If you enter a curve and you seem to be catching up to this point then you are travelling too fast."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't be inspired by the end... or can you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's predictable, the way VP ends... you can't find it cheery to see how he finally got to the end. Doesn't somehow mean it is not inspirational.I like the Charlotte Rampling scenes; I think that's actually some of the best parts in the film. I've heard her described as symbolizing Death itself- it fits. Her on screen presence is chilling. Weirdest part: Kowalski wakes up, presumably in a dawn weed hangover, and he is alone. Where did she go? His bet is lost. What is the hurry? Nonetheless, he's off like a cannon shot, again.And that, simple minded as it is, is how one feels inspired by watching the movie. Speed, for its own sake, has a peculiar draw. I know the morning after i watched this, I had to go to work on a Saturday morning. This is unusual for me, I typically face a M-F grind. I got to ride on ten miles of highway which is usually clogged with commuters. It was wide open road, 75 degrees, sunny. I made a joyful noise with my exhausts and went up the road at warp speed. FREEEEDOM! One doesn't have to be morose and death-obsessed to want to attain a simply absurd rate of speed. I once ran into an old acquaintance who I had not seen in ten years; he quoted, verbatim, a challenge I suggested in the middle '90s. Start in Tucson, aim for the Tempe city limits; after you start your engine, switch on the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street. If you make it before the album's done, you're doing well.The distance is 97 miles; the album is 67:17. Good luck.How is this different from betting a handful of pills against a (very real) threat of death as in VP? It's exactly the same. Yet the fact that I suggested it forever stuck in this guy's mind; this film has a similar singularity. I really think it's a better take on the Easy Rider idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Car delivery driver Kowalski is handed the job of driving a 1970 Dodge Challenger from Colorado to California, but he also accepts a bet that he'd reach his destination in no less than 15 hours. After popping some pills, the trip begins and soon enough he encounters the highway patrol after not pulling over for some motorcycle officers. Now the police are in hot pursuit for their man, but Kowalski gets help from Supersoul; a blind DJ who's using his police scanner to inform his man of what's going on and by turning this free spirit into a modern day hero. On his journey he also finds himself meeting a wide range of characters.Over-hyped or under-hyped, I'm caught in two minds. To tell the truth, I didn't mind it and it's hard to keep your eyes off it. I guess that's all that matters. Even though I still question its reputation. However this product of the times is one unusual character odyssey through America's sprawling desert backyard of friends and foes that this laconically seldom figure comes by on his simple goal from a to b. What we get is unique and fascinating escapism road dash, with it all slowly unravelling, but there's not much mystic drawn off the protagonist, because of some odd, if unfulfilled flashbacks interwoven into the minimal plot, which don't equal much and are only there to give us the usual complexities in an extended car chase. Not much is clearly explained, but we watch how he's basically a vacant shell to his life (thanks to past flashbacks we know what triggers it) and surroundings, well that's up until this speeding journey, which triggers a mind-set that this might be a good way to go out. Of course, it's all about your interpretation of what's unfolding. On the other hand looking too deep within it, might just show-up how silly the whole thing is. I guess that depends what you're looking for. Dialogue is pretty light-weight and sparse. Really, it's director Michael Pearson's stylishly credible and dazzlingly gravel-charged car chase scenes that makes it a real hoot and it's backed up by John Alonzo's crisply, all-embracing scenic photography of the fetching locations and authentically gritty action. Pearson's direction holds a neat rhythm to it, but he can get spontaneously creative when he uses camera angles and a spiced-up, soul-filled soundtrack to depict and balance out the right tone and feel. The blood does get a good workout. When this begins, something is always happening (plenty of separate episodes make up the narrative) and it doesn't take too long to get into it. The performances are particularly sound with most of the interesting arising from the lesser support roles. Barry Newman's gives a acceptably moody lead performance as Kowalski. He doesn't shine, but it's workable. Cleavon Little's energy-delivered turn as DJ Supersoul is a nice touch and he could have been seen as some sort of guardian angel looking over him or maybe a voice in Kowalski's head that he hasn't encountered in quite a while. Popping up in minor, but quite interesting or bizarre character roles are Paul Koslo, Robert Donner, Dean Jagger, John Amos, Anthony James and a eye-opening bike-riding nude Gilda Texter.It's flawed and lacks the force to make a huge imprint, but this trendy slice of the times is easy on the eyes and pure machismo fun in its bang-up car stunts. Worthy of its cult appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having a dull day? Rent Vanishing Point. This movie takes you on a ridiculous trip through Denver, Utah, Nevada and California from behind the wheel of a 1970 Dodge Challenger, definitely one of the iconic muscle cars from the era. The driver, Kowalski, although very quiet forms a very strong relationship with the viewer as he careens us through twisty canyon and dead straight desert roads, all the while being pursued by southern police, who don't seem to enjoy this speed demon flailing through their territory. Super Soul is the local radio DJ who pretty much gives the energy the movie needs to not be a sole-car-chase film. His hippity-hop music gives a continuing relationship to the chases and scenes in the film, and gives it a kinda folky (almost 1970s...suprise!) feel. Definitely worth buying/renting, especially if you're the kind of person who likes hurtling metal down roads.</fullReview>

You will not be lest down. Another reason I love this movie is that it show the true heartland of America and how it used to be, and still is in some cases. But now in this age of technological advances and the government being able to track every single move that you make. Its nice to see how it used to be. I was not there to see the original when it first came out but if I ever get the money, I will pay to see it on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great, great movie! Forget all the nervous nellies who are worried about plot or character development. That's not what this movie is about.This movie is about emotion. It's about being able to live the fantasy - for an hour and a half - of what you wish you could have done every time those damn flashing blue lights appeared in your mirror. (Note that some say that this movie served as the inspiration for the great Cannonball open-road races.)It's also about a lot of other things, like choices we make, freedom, the clash of subcultures, what constitutes good and evil - and how they can get confused, especially in a period of deep cultural change. It's about the sixties, and the question of good and bad, and how did drugs go from being the symbol and instrument of love and liberation to the destructive force they are today. It's about love, and striving, and desperation, and loss.It's a celebration of the muscle car, and the open road, and at the same time it's about social issues of the time and of all time: it juxtaposes racism and hypocrisy in religion against gorgeous music (including gospel), compassion, integrity, and vision. It even touches on homophobia.But mostly this is a movie about the joy of the open road and the ecstasy of a wide open throttle and the music of a big block at full song - and about a society that offered those joys with one hand and reached out with the other to try to destroy those who couldn't, or wouldn't, resist those temptations.It's a movie about rebellion. It's a movie about soaring instead of plodding.It's a movie about not going gently into that good night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best car chase movie EVER! It's got my vote. Cleavon Little who is one of the most underrated actors and a great loss to the movies has delivered a great role. The film is a cross-country car chase with the cops in pursuit of a lone anti-establishment ex racer played by Barry Newman. Cleavon little plays a radio DJ who is commentating the chase to listeners and which soon captures media attention, catapulting Newman into a celebrity who is defying the law, gaining much respect with the public, especially Little. Vanishing Point was made in the 1971, at the height of the Vietnam War and the film captures that time very well. The soundtrack is great. Watch it, the movie will stay in you memory for many days after and you'll be humming the soundtrack all day long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite road movies of all time. I think this is a better film than Easy Rider. Barry Newman's subtle non-macho performance is the perfect contrast to the awesome muscle car which carries him to his vanishing point. I just listened to the dvd commentary track by director Richard C Sarafian, where he claims his choice for Newman's role was Gene Hackman. I don't think Hackman could have done a better job, in fact the balance of the car and the driver would not have been the same. Gene Hackman is an incredible actor, but Barry Newman was, in my opinion, ideal for this film. I find this film to be both beautiful and haunting, from the incredible handheld cinematography of the late great John A Alonzo, to the uplifting and deeply poignant soundtrack. This film can be viewed on many different levels from an exciting car chase movie to a true American existential classic. I never get tired of works of art and Vanishing Point is such a work. I can't understand why 20th Century Fox failed to put out a soundtrack album. "Another Soul Goes Free" 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lost generation drives very fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vanishing Point and Dirty Harry both focus on the place for traditional male roles in society in the face of a cultural revolution which lashed out at the traditional white male. dirty Harry strikes out at what he considers the perverions of society including sexual freedom and the cowardice of the peace movement.Kowalski, the hero of Vanishing Point, merely buys alot of Metha-amphetamine and picks up a super-charged 440 Chrysler to drive from Denver to San Francisco non-stop. A feat which he is told is impossible. In the thinnest story line ever his reason for doing this is because "He must be back by three." That's it for the story so nothing has been lost by telling you.It's the journey in which Kowalski stumbles across his past, which is important. It seems that Kowaski has never failed to be the hero. He has done all the things that should be considered good in society and followed his own morals, but finds that his morals are left behind by society's ethics. In the end, Kowalski comes to the realization that he lost himself through irrelevance and he ceases to be. (The Camaro which slams into the highway scraper, I think is supposed to be the Challenger.) All in all, it's a great film. It has great bit parts, and it's sense of listlessness sums up a generation lost by change, whose story was then and is now, was and is considered irrelevant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people need movies which contain explanations about what's going on, explanations that are as complete and simple as possible. If you're one of these people you probably won't like Vanishing Point, unless all you need for a plot is a 440 Challenger roaring across country with cops in pursuit... Vanishing Point works on that level and works superbly. But if you like films where events and motivations somehow make sense, yet defy a clear explanation, then Vanishing Point is definitely a film for you. It's richness and depth are such that even people who love the film can't make sense of the reasons why others love it. It resonates below the conscious level, down where your distinct individual personality resides. The small separate episodes and flashbacks that make up the story either compound into something profound or are ignored without loss. Everyone has their own unique a blend of the two. So what are the highlights? For me they change with every viewing. Last time it was Cleavon Little as the blind DJ named Super Soul - what a cool wonder! Before that it was the Dodge -- long telephoto shots and its bass big-block scream. My main regret is that the studio cut out the Charlotte Rampling segments in an attempt to make it more "mainstream." I'd love to see that version and put even more Vanishing Point deep into my subconscious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first got into this film after buying the PRIMAL SCREAM album of the same name, of which this film provides a loose template.The sheer nihilism of this movie is tremendous and although it could be viewed as a carbon copy of Easy Rider, Vanishing Point is more a reaction to the naive natured Wyatt and Billy. If 'Rider' is undoubtedly a marijuana movie, then Vanishing Point is pure speed.Dismiss the forgettable bit part actors, concentrate on the visuals and the brilliant sound track and most of all the roar of the super-charged V8, this is uncompromising US cinema at its best. Bleak desert wilderness have never had so many loaded connotations since.So turn down the lights, put on PRIMAL SCREAM's fittingly alternative sound track and experience a film with a hollow heart but unrivaled historical poignantcy to match the best of Peckinpah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly the Greatest Auto Chase Movie of All Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes it good is its mystical lead character Kowalski; the great scenic shots of the west, and a first class sound track. The movie hits on just about all cylinders. Definitely a cult movie because only those with a love for the open road and the love of that supercharged engine even remember the movie. Super Soul is an ingenious addition to the plot. He helps bring out the soul of the movie. The message? It depends upon the observer. For me, Super Soul ( The African American,blind DJ) hit it on the nail by stating that Kowalski is ?The last free soul on the face of this earth?.Born in 1960, the movie brings me back to the spirit of the late 1960?s and early 1970?s where the anti establishment ruled the day. Of course, (humor) in those days it was a noble anti establishment, filled with lofty dreams and ideas about humankind that fade somewhat as we grow older. The establishment of course was reflected in the ego-filled deputy and in the angry town?s people who attacked Super Soul.The character Kowalski (a car delivery man) is examined by the camera and the script, but only just enough to allow the viewer to develop his own perception of who he is and why is he trying this impossible feat. (Driving from Denver to San Francisco in flight time) What we do know is the loss of the woman in his life may have triggered his emotions. We know that he was a former racecar driver and police officer and the fact that he is a former Medal of Honor war hero who has always tried to do what was right. We also get the mixed message of his use of ?speed? and marijuana. This challenges us to make a frail attempt to understand this complicated character. It is even further complicated by the mystical communication between he and Super Soul.The tone of the movie is set on that rainy Denver, Colorado night when he drives out in that Super Charged, Dodge Challenger and makes that turn onto the bridge, whipping the tail of that refined machine deliberately. When we hear the loud roar of that big engine, we know we are in for a real treat.There is some unevenness in the movie. The movie length of the movie, I believe makes keeping it even a real challenge. The plus-side however, is that the length of the film gives the viewer time to formulate his own ideas, perceptions and judgements about Kowalski. Who is he? Why is he doing this? The movie is unique in the sense in that it purposely does not answer these questions.This will always be my favorite car chase film of all times. Sometimes I see a little of Kowalski in me as I drive my Camaro out in the open west.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Bullitt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie, and, yes, I thought it was better than Bullitt. I know I'm courageous to say something like that and then leave my e-mail address, but you should also understand that I'm a 16-year old watching these movies for the first time. The car chase scene in Bullitt was amazing, but I thought that the rest of the movie was pretty average. Vanishing Point, in contrast, isn't as fondly remembered as Bullitt, so I wasn't expecting a world-changing car chase scene. What I got was an impressive amount of social commentary in addition to some impressive car chases. The movie is very psychological and involving, and the flashbacks really told the story. The show is so deep and stirring that calling it an action or chase movie would really be selling it short. Personally, I found the ending a bit perplexing, but at least I didn't find it trivial like in Bullitt. I'm really glad I watched this movie, and after watching it I wonder why people are so fixated on chase movies like Bullitt and Smoky and the Bandit.MikeCSR @ Blockbuster Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a film, a life experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once drove from Albany to Niagara Falls in a day, on roads that just kept on going, seemingly without end - not something we get a lot of in the UK - and I was changed by the experience of driving in this massive country, knowing that it didn't have to stop there, I could have kept on going.Watching Vanishing Point I got a similar feeling, driving in isolation, the call of the open road. Of course, you end up having too much time to think about life and past regrets when you are driving for that long, and that for me is the attraction of this film. Kowalski is driving to escape his past, but no matter how fast he drives his past continues to haunt him - listen to the conversation he has about driving to San Francisco - no-one can drive that distance in that short a time.By choosing to have no companion for Kowalski, the director avoids useless banter, the engine noise is the dialogue. Of course, a film with just a guy driving down a road would be quite dull, so we are given some interludes of Kowalski meeting other people as real life interrupts his introspection, but in the end he decides his own destiny.P.S. The car chases are cool too!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was first turned on to the film after reading of the '97 TV remake in Motor Trend which highly suggested viewing of the original for, if anything else, the beauty of the 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T (with the 440 slant six option). I eventually tracked down seemingly the only copy in PA and watched in utter amazement. To me, Vanishing Point is more than "Bullitt on Mescaline," but more akin to a religious experience. Call me silly, but the film is, in all rights, the last great "psychedelic" road film--one that has not been usurped yet. Fantastic parallels to Christ (with Kowlaski's character) some of best cinematography I've ever seen in a low-budget flick, a narrative that requires the viewer to actually think (hey--that's a novel idea, ain't it?) and locations that harken back to the greatest westerns all make this an absolutely necessary experience. Not necessarily the happiest film ever shot, it does leave the viewer with a euphoria that lasts for days. Hopefully this gem will make it to DVD soon--the pan/scan video transfer just does not do justice to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting metaphor, but ultimately pretty boring to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is about a guy in a white car chasing through the desert parts of America while being chased by the police for speeding (or better said, not stopping for patrol cars). That's it. The scenery and the background 70's music is all that fills the movie.Of course, it is also more than that, a metaphor of a man's journey through life. The ending was at the same time as I had expected it, although I really wanted it to have more meaning. Charlotte Rampling, back then young and terribly beautiful, makes an episodic appearance as the hitchhiker that knows our hero by name and says she had been waiting for him for forever. That's his absolution, the forgiveness, the abandonment of the real world and the acceptance of self. Or at least this is how I saw it.Bottom line: if you are in a pensive mood you might appreciate both the allegory and the beautiful scenery, maybe even the hippy open road feel. Otherwise, you might be sadly disappointed. Myself, while I can't say I regret seeing "a cult movie", I also can't say it is a movie I really wanted to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was just cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in high school back in 1971, my friends and I spent many of our Friday and Saturday nights at the drive-in theater, which is where and when I first saw Vanishing Point. We saw it once, and then we went to see it again a couple of weeks later and probably again when it came back the next year (as movies did at the drive-in). We weren't interested in probing its symbolism or considering how it reflected the tensions in American society or represented the quest for individual freedom. We just thought it was cool as hell, no doubt because we unconsciously responded to all its symbolic and ideological underpinnings, superficial and obvious as they may be. Back then, I had a fairly powerful emotional response to Vanishing Point but not so much now. I've seen it a couple of times in the last ten or twelve years, and I was much more aware of its weaknesses. I still enjoyed it, but its only real emotional or intellectual impact on me was one of nostalgia. However, I saw it again tonight in HD (March 2010), and the thing that really stood out was just how bad-ass that Challenger still looks. In the midst of all those other boxy, awkward, top-heavy early 70s American cars was this incredibly lithe and stylish vehicle that appears futuristic even today. Indeed, I think it looks better and more "modern" than the brand new retro-challenger currently in production. That beautiful muscle car and those all-natural naked hippie chicks have held up pretty damned well. Now if we could just bring back the drive-ins . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film definitely makes you think. Barry Newman carried the role off perfectly with subtle facial expressions and minimal dialogue. He seemed to be an unhappy, edgy, troubled guy. Definitely suicidal, he seemed fed up with life. Through flashbacks, you can see that he'd been through a lot in the past ten years and losing his girlfriend in a drowning accident pushed him over the edge.The car chase scenes were terrific. It makes me want to purchase a white 2008 Challenger. Cleavon Little's "Super Soul" DJ was a nice addition and served to tie everything together. He and Kowalski were kindred souls in that they somehow didn't fit in.They were both tortured souls.The movie was bookended with the bulldozer scene. Very thought-provoking, beautiful cinematography. One blooper - a cop is reviewing Kowalski's history - he was a Vietnam Vet. He was decorated for his combat action in the Mekong Delta in 1964. No way - the war didn't get going until 1965.Another amusing detail - the cop who was ultimately his main protagonist runs like a girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best $5 I will ever spend. Thank you, Wal Mart.The disc I purchased has both US and UK versions. The UK version is the only one I've seen (it's about 6 minutes longer.) I'm a huge fan of movies coming from the late sixties and early seventies. Cool Hand Luke, for instance - is probably my favorite movie of all time.This is a movie about an ex-cop turned speedracer who gets washed up, and ends up working for a car delivery service. His best friend is his 'up' dealer, and his name is Kowolski, first last and only.Vanishing Point doesn't take very long to jump into its plot as Kowolski is given the task of delivering a 'Challenger' to Frisco (San Francisco), and then buys a handful of ups/speed from his buddy, making a bet that he can make it to Frisco by the very next day in the process.Although Kowolski is in fact a very 'cool' and clever guy who's fun to watch, the drive of this movie essentially comes from the music, and a blind African American DJ named Super Soul. Just about every word that comes out of this characters mouth is pure greatness. "The question is not where he'll be stopped, but who will stop him." - This quote (which may not be exact) in relationship with the ending of this movie, and the look on Super Souls face in reaction to it .. is profound.Kowolski is being chased by the law. Helicopters, camped cruisers, and a whole office of people working to track his very location. "And there goes the Challenger" shouts Super, "being chased by the blue, blue meanies on wheels! The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver, the last American hero, the electric centaur, the, the demi-god, the super driver of the golden west!" - This is a movie about someone who once lived their dream, and then lost that life .. who finds himself one day trying desperately to get it back. On his journey, he encounters a thrill-seeking porsche, a self-actualized snake-catching prospector, and a couple of hippie's, one of whom is a naked chick on a motorcycle.Does he win the bet, or is he stopped in his tracks? Find out, and watch this beautiful cult classic. Imagine Cool Hand Luke meets Easy Rider.Awesome movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one thing about the film Vanishing Point it is that people have always tried to read a lot of meaning as to what it is really about. This is one of the great things about the film. One might say it is a blank canvas that you can paint your own meaning into. That said, I will try to give you what I think the film is about. More than anything I think it is about the death of the sixties. Where the 60's were about peace, love and understanding this films shows that these are pretty much dead in the 70's. In fact you could say that this film was way ahead of its time and was pretty much right on the money. This film really gave birth to the 70's car flicks. Just about all 70's car flicks owe it to this film for really setting the standard that they never lived up to. Do yourself a favor and stay away from the lame remake of this film. It is not worth the film it was shot on and it was like they never saw the original movie. If they did they never got it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent flick. Its a bit hard to follow the first time round, but I always come back to it for the simple fact that it has THAT Dodge in it. The '70 Challenger rocks and makes this film. It just looks so good doing those stunts. And I can rest easy knowing that the car destroyed at the end of the film wasn't a '70 Challenger, but a cheaper, more abundant '69 Camaro. Barry Newman's performance is great, and Cleavon Little is also brilliant. Not to sure about the rest of the cast though. people always seem to ask why he's driving like that in the fist place, and why crash? Well, hes bet his dealer that he can make the distance in the time for the value of his tab, so a valid reason to do it. And the flashbacks on Kowolski's life shows how bad it's been for him, so suicide would seem reasonable. Or perhaps he was just to stoned to realise what he's doing? Anyway, as everyone knows, the film was remade for TV in '97, and has recently been released on DVD. The remake was obviously made on a lower budget, and has received bad reviews. I disagree, and will be reviewing the remake soon. This is regularly classed as a cult film, and rightly so. Not to everyones taste, but you should really check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>VP is basically the product of a high-concept existential art film getting hastily re-cut into a crappy B-movie at the last minute. The results, strangely enough, are maybe better than either one of them intended.If VP had been allowed to finish as a full-blown "artsy" film, it would probably have been a little cheesy &amp; clumsy by modern standards. There are enough heavy-handed moments in it to make me wonder about how much better the creators' lost original version would really have been if it was seen through modern eyes. But with the studio trying to silence the deeper aspects of VP in the editing room, it takes on a whole new feeling that may have helped it age better than most of the other similar works from the time period. It never reveals any specific message/meaning that you could categorize &amp; describe, but you always get the strong feeling that you didn't get it all. It's maybe not as obvious as scenes being cut in half or anything . . . but it sort of feels like they shot several different versions of each dialog scene during production, and this version you're watching is always the "short, B-movie" one. It makes you wonder what else might be in a can somewhere in a vault at 20th Century-Fox. And like a lot of art forms, it can be a lot more fun to wonder about what's missing than just watching what's there to see.VP is much more memorable than the sum of its parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this as a teenager in the 1970s I thought it was a great commercial for a Challenger R/T and it still is - Dodge must have been pleased. The movie owes a lot to "Easy Rider" and a little to "Bullitt" which preceded it, but it set a new benchmark for the road movie genre, one which hasn't been surpassed, although many of the elements have been copied since. The cinematography is simply beautiful, and even if you're not into cars it should be watched for its presentation of the great wide open desert areas of America. It isn't all about speed thrills, there are occasions where Kowalski slows or stops to appreciate forgotten still life and tranquility. From a social perspective it was made at the transition from the 1960s to the 1970s and captures this phase well; the idealism of the "love, peace and good vibes" period was being replaced with something else. I give the movie a 9 overall, it doesn't quite get a 10 because of a few elements - such as the gay robbers - which could have been dropped in favor of developing other aspects more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Classic Period Flick- Have always loved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You need to have experienced the 70's to garner the full appreciation for how this movie captured the essence of those times. The plot is that there really is no plot.Kowalski's character and his interactions with the people he came into contact with is what makes this film.(along with 500 hp of white Mopar thunder)When you take a second look (or as in my case a 20th look), this film essentially shows us a series of everyday salt of the earth people who lived during those times. It doesn't compel the viewer to try to picture themselves as some far reaching superhero or high ranking police detective. Kowalski is just your average joe, with a trivial job, who really just doesn't have a whole lot going for him nor does he give a damn.This movie is for the rural, mechanically inclined gear heads out there who often wondered what would happen if instead of stopping for the cops I just put the foot to the floor and kept on running. Screw them, catch me if you can baby ! You'll also find that many of the same themes from the film are prevalent today: drugs,religious cults,racism, music,same-sex marriages,man's preoccupation with the automobile, police corruption, suicide. Sure there are a lot of differences between the ways things were back then and today, but this movie shows you that the more things change, the more they stay the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not-at-all bad slice of the 1970s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to agree 100% with the reviewer above on this film. It's not simply a hokey car-chase -- but it has an additional aspect that makes it worth watching: a tasty slice of 1970s culture. Kowalski's big sideburns, the brown-tinted aviator sunglasses, the portrayal of a "soul" deejay, the hip-hugging bell-bottoms, the free-love biker chick, the Harley dude, surfboard culture, honky cops, "squares," they're all here.An extra bonus is counting the number of times people say "dig?" and "right on." Good stuff, worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Vanishing Point Influence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One need only to watch "Vanishing Point" to recognize how it served as a 90 minute, condensed blueprint for the "Dukes of Hazzard" TV series. The camera angles, the Handsome Hero vs. Dumb Cop plot, sharp muscle cars and gratuitous female nudity, all replayed to perfection every Friday night for America to follow. But it's that vague, almost spiritual sense that keeps "Vanishing Point" interesting almost thirty years later. I own it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about the car.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is all about the car, without the 1970 dodge challenger this movie would not of been nearly as popular. Can you imagine kowalski driving a ford pinto or an amc gremlin? I think not.kowalski is challenging all authority and he needs a car to do it in and that's where the challenger comes in, the name sez's it all.That's why this car is one of the most sought after in the world of muscle cars because of what it represents.Also remember the movie (bullit) with that great car chase? It was the 68 mustang and 68 charger that saved the movie .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>self-conscious mysticism doesn't quite gel with this cross-country chase film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to this after six months of being reminded that it was a primary influence on Tarantino when he was making "Death Proof". Well, I hated the Tarantino film, but I did like the car chase sequences in it; heck, I've always liked car chases, who doesn't like car chases? So it was with a mixture of trepidation and excitement that I popped this baby in the DVD player.I needn't have bothered, actually. Sure, the white Charger is cool and there are several good sequences of the "hero", Kowalski (Barry Newman) evading cops, off-roading through the desert, etc, but the film's would-be mysticism and self-conscious attempts to hit the hippie/druggie audience wear thin pretty quickly, and there just isn't enough reality to any of the characters to take the thing straight even if we were intended to.Cleavon Little's turn as blind (and apparently visionary) disk jockey Super Soul, broadcasting black music in the middle of nowhere in the Southwest (THAT calls for a suspension of disbelief for sure) is nice, but the scene where he and his engineer (John Amos in a thankless role) are beaten up by a mob seems completely pointless and geared towards a political agenda that is otherwise resolutely unclear in this weird mess of a film. Dean Jagger is his usual reliable self as the desert-dwelling prospector who helps Kowalski on his way towards his destiny with.....who cares. Nice double-sided DVD transfer; I watched the shorter American cut first, but the 2nd side British version wasn't viewable. And it didn't much bug me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Point Beyond Existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Others have suggested that the only symbolism worth mentioning, in this movie, is in the title. What is the point beyond which it is pointless to exist? Our hero, Kowalski, is trying to find out. He makes piecemeal efforts at existing and only succeeds in self-destructing. Clearly, his life once had promise and meaning, but the death of his girlfriend haunts him. Kowalski asks the question of God: "Why?" The response is like a Samuel Beckett play. Kowalski is just existing, biding his time, waiting for life to give him one more thing to which he can react. He has lost his will to be pro-active. He has lost his will to live. Each time I watch this movie I am stunned with the degree of nihilism and anti-authoritarianism it represents. Freedom is almost described as "doing one's own thing" as opposed to selling out to the establishment. In truth, freedom is a good deal more difficult and a great deal quieter. It isn't the person who goes down in a blaze of glory who is the hero as much as it is the one who has the courage to carry on in life.The thrill of speed was unparalleled in those days, but that requires some explanation. No one who drove quickly in the 60's and 70's could fail to remember the sound of the big 440 Mopar when the secondaries kicked in. The 440 was such a torque monster that it was difficult to run away from it, even in those big boxy sedan bodies. Cars didn't handle nearly as well as they do now and the tires were considerably worse. If you were traveling 125 mph in a street car, you were traveling very quickly. In fact, most times, it bordered on insanity.The 440 cop cars, by the way, could top out at around 140. The light bar added a lot of drag on the top end and you could pull away slightly above 100, if your car was so disposed. The Challenger had an advantage, to be sure being smaller, lighter and more aerodynamic, but not nearly as much as one would think. Even the vaunted 426 Hemi wouldn't have made a lot of difference in this case. Despite what one might suspect would be a tremendous speed advantage, on an open and straight road, it's doubtful that a better engine and better car would run away from a cop. The tricks from this movie usually resulted in someone turning his car over. The State Highway Patrol, at very least, knew how to handle those cars pretty well. I am impressed at how well the movie turns Kowalski into a hero and the law into Nazis. We all like Kowalski: he is a decent guy, even helping the queers when their car broke down. (By the way, at the time, that scene served as great comic relief.) But the larger question is this: who pushed Kowalski into this corner? In reality, how would you like your son or daughter killed because some guy was racing his car on the street just on a bet?He is a likable character for whom life has gone very wrong. Kowalski doesn't like that life is as hard and apparently nasty as it is. I hope we all share that with him. However, Benzedrine isn't a way of seeing clearly: it's a way of obscuring the reality with a rush. It really does give one the feeling of invincibility and superiority. It exacts a terrible price on the body and mind. The "Vanishing Point" is that point at which life ceases to be of value to oneself. One might argue that Kowalski had already reached that point before the chase began. Suicide isn't the lack of options in one's life as much as it is the failure to recognize that there are viable options. God might have had something else in mind for the Kowalskis in this life, but they may choose not to listen, or, worse, no longer be able to listen. The Christian symbolism throughout the movie seems anti-climactic in some ways. In several ways, it is man's involvement with God's word that gets in the way of God's own message. The humans who call themselves Christians in this movie don't seem much better of than Kowalski is and maybe even a bit worse. It looks like Christianity is in opposition to what people find pleasing in this world. Mark Twain made roughly the same point in Letters from the Earth. When God does not make life the way we want it, then we aren't going to play by His rules. Each of has this choice, as Camus said in the opening lines of The Stranger. Kowalski gives up because he is hurt. Each of us has been there. Dealing with things our own way usually leads us to ruin. Kowalski is hurting too much to see any other options. The pain is too great for him to stand. Giving in to God seems like giving in to everything else, like giving up. He sees that going out in the blaze of glory as the only honest thing left to do. Frankly, I hope viewers see that as a drug-infused (excuse the pun) cop out. It's a lot harder to live than it is to die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had a white Datsun once. Wrote it off after a week.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sarafian's CV does not boast a lot of familiar names until you hit Vanishing Point, and with this memorable film he has justified his existence. You can practically feel the heat and dust and there is an amazing shot filmed from the air of Kowalski going in circles around the desert. The writer of a book I read on cult movies was uncomfortable with the adoration afforded this film's lead character. An exponent of flower power and free love risking the lives of innocent people, maybe even children, with reckless driving was distasteful to him and quite rightly. But I think the point was that Kowalski was not a part of the hippy, tune-in, drop-out scene around him. He only took one type of drug to keep himself awake while driving rather than to expand his conciousness and he was offered women TWICE, the latter being stark naked and more or less saying, "Please take me! Take me! You're my hero!" and he declined. What sort of free love guru is that? I mean, is he some kind of goddamn fag or something? Apparently not, as he met two such gentlemen in question and made it abundantly clear that although he had nothing against them, he was not part of their scene either.No, Kowalski is his own man, a wild eyed loner on a one way ticket to oblivion and his counter-culture friend is uneasy, sensing something and requesting him not to do "any heavy sh*t out there, man!" Kowalski, now rejected by the establishment, has no home and his personal statement of nihilism turns out to be tragically out of step with the temper of the times, which is to let it all hang out man, but not in pieces all over the dashboard. It is a timeless reminder about not making heroes out of people for your own reasons, and living vicariously through their actions as personified by the character of super-soul who unjustly elevates K to cult status through his radio show. His suggested psychic contact with K fits in with the mystical interests of the day but seems naff and dated now. In any case, his mental exhortations go unheeded and he is left a disillusioned man.Some have suggested Kowalski is another Christ figure beloved of hippy films of the day but one is not left comforted and inspired by Vanishing Point's ending. It suggests that the end is really the end and man may not have a souped up super-soul at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>oh boy, it's *that* type of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About halfway through the movie I realized that I was watching a truly bad movie, one of the ones that's interesting enough and bad enough to be unintentionally funny. It takes a little while to get that, because the photography is very good and some of the action is decent, but the horribly cheesy flashbacks pretty much point where the movie is ultimately going -- to the point where quality itself vanishes. The hero of the movie, Kowalski, is supposed to be some sort of nihilist hero. I guess nihilism is all you have left after you've admitted that your whole grasp of 60s idealism was rooted in free love and free drugs, which this movie seems pretty unabashed to admit. My girlfriend came in about half an hour from the end of the movie, and as it was ending she was saying "this doesn't make any sense!" I said, "oh yeah it makes total sense, you just missed all the important stuff. You see, his girlfriend was killed in a tragic surfing accident....". Oh yes, it's *that* kind of movie too, the kind of movie that's painfully self-serious and consciously tragic.I suppose there was some kind of attempt to be deep there. He was a cop, a good representative of 60s morality, he even could have been one of the Beach Party kids. But then his girlfriend was killed in the tragic surfing accident and he got in a car crash or something. Oh yeah and he witnessed another cop abusing a suspect, that was pretty life changing for him apparently. All of this is told to us in painfully intrusive flashbacks. There's a confused attempt to tie the whole thing in to the "Easy Rider" biker genre as well.Basically this movie was like "Billy Jack" with cars, except that unlike "Billy Jack" there's no sincerity in the movie, and the professionalism of the whole package seems to dull any edge of "anti-establishment" that might have been mined from the screenplay. It's like the TV version of "Easy Rider", which makes sense since the director is the same guy who later made the TV versions of "African Queen" and "Splendor in the Grass." At one point we're supposed to be all worked up because an annoying black DJ gets beat up by racist cops (I was just hoping it would mean we wouldn't have to listen to him anymore). It's all too poorly done to even feel manipulative in its stupid, obvious way. But then to make things infinitely worse, there's the obligatory scene where he picks up two gay hitch-hikers and beats them up (of course it was "justified", because they tried to rob him). So the movie wallows in ignorance and stereotypes while at the same time it tries to lay claim to 60s styled idealism that must have seemed a bit pass in 1971 when the film was released. The hero is a guy who refuses weed but loves popping amphetamines. This is exactly the stuff that destroyed the "hippie" movement, but this film glorifies it. Basically this is a movie that would have made you feel really embarrassed if you were actually part of the peace movement; it's just exploiting some of the tropes for nudity and so forth without having any of the soul of real revolution. This movie posits empty destructive nihilism as the same thing or perhaps more glamorous than actual liberalism.There's a nice strange bit where he meets an old man in the desert played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger. By the time you get to the hippie biker in the desert, you can't help cracking up when you see his naked girlfriend riding a motorcycle in circles in the desert, stark naked. That hot bike seat must really burn her butt! Why would someone do something like that? Would it be fun? No, it would just look "cool" in a stupid movie like this.I give the movie a few points for unintentional comedy and for a very cool soundtrack including an appearance by the legendary flower gospel group "Delaney and Bonnie and Friends." Basically I would recommend people watch better films with a more sincere point in the same vein that followed after "Easy Rider," like "Electra Glide in Blue" and "Two-Lane Blacktop." This one is truly half-baked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing that this was one of the best car movies of all time and being a car lover myself I decided to pick this up out of the bargain bin at Walmart.This movie is BAD from the start to the end. Really the only good thing about it is the 1970 Challenger. There is really no plot just a guy driving a car and getting chased by the police. If you really want to see this movie just watch the first and last 10 minutes and you'll have seen everything you need to see. Even being a car guy and in particular a Mopar fan I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone.Now if you really want to watch a classic car movie I'd recommend "Gumball Rally" It is truly a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid car chase movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>VANISHING POINT is a mix of the classic car chase film and a more existential movie along the lines of EASY RIDER; the good news is that it's substantially better than EASY RIDER, and has a sheen of quality lacking in the more crowd-pleasing car flicks of the 1970s (like GONE IN 60 SECONDS and SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT).Barry Newman, playing it understated, is the driver who's tasked with delivering a car cross country under a strict time limit. Before long, the cops are on his tail for speeding, and what follows is an intense pursuit flick with some great filming of high speed chases. VANISHING POINT is a film that's all about the visual, and it does look lovely, the director capturing the sleekness of the vehicles and by contrast the wildness of the desert locales very well.And, of course, there's THAT ending, which is unforgettable once seen, and helps to add immeasurably to the experience. I think the story as a whole could have been a little more powerful - it's very slim, and there's barely any characterisation - but this is a classic production far above more recent Hollywood stabs at the genre (like DRIVE ANGRY).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disaffection is a terrible thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is a 'cult movie' - and I won't begrudge it that status. It's original and has style and power, and it oozes time and place. However, I find that on my most recent viewing at age 45 (it made a big impression seeing it for the first time at 30) I have a problem. That problem is Kowalski himself. He is the central character, he is on screen for about 90% of the time, and everything the movie says or tries to say about life is through his eyes and ears and memory. He is the one we must empathise with. I am all for 'anti-heroes': Dirty Harry, Creasy (Man on Fire) and even the repulsive Bad Lieutenant are thoroughly engaging characters. Kowalski, however, is a tit.The premise: disaffected former racing driver tries to deliver a car from Colorado to San Francisco in 15 hours, and spawns an inter-state police hunt as his lunatic driving makes waves. He reflects on his life whilst encountering strangers on the way. One of these is a sexy naked blonde who offers him 'some fun', which he turns down, preferring a 'smoke'. Also, it's revealed he's scored as highly as this if not better in the past, but it seems could not commit or even enjoy. What the f*** is his problem??! Hell, we've all had hard knocks in life, but this guy appears to have had (and still has) a better chance than most of us at happiness. Hell, he's no older than 35 yet! It was also said he could have been a great driver, but 'didn't want it'.I found I just wanted to tell Kowalski, "Get some psychological help, before you kill somebody besides yourself."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting 70's retrospective.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has very strong flavors of the 70's. The scenes that show crowds gathering at the sides of the highways to witness the action are straight out of the 1970's with hippies, long hair, side burns, the clothing and open land. Some scenes leave one longing for the simple, easy but politically hot life of the 1970's. The film is shot very well, the acting is very good. There are some very interesting scenes here &amp; there that Hollywood doesn't seem to be able to do anymore. However, not all of this is amusing or engaging. There are long scenes of Barry just driving. It wasn't all that exciting. There is something very alluring about films that depict a man or woman racing across the country trying to outrun the Highway Patrol and the small towns that either cheer on or curse the lone driver who throws caution to the wind and just drives. But a lot of the allure comes from our memories of these 1970's films and watching them again doesn't always seem as exciting as when we saw them when we were young. This one isn't bad but I can't imagine digging it out of my collection once a year to rewatch it. I think one viewing would be enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Existential Car Chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vanishing Point" may be the ultimate late-night movie. It's full of action, short on dialogue, and you can come in at any point and know what's going on.That's how I first saw the movie, and it was so good I spent years tracking it down. I finally saw the whole thing and it was worth the wait. Our hero, Kowalski, isn't just driving to meet his deadline, he's driving to escape. It's an existential car chase, a metaphor for man's struggle with authority, his struggle with himself, but mostly it's a beautifully-visual high-speed ride through the desolate, dusty desert.Car chases were at their best in the 70's... long, graceful cars, wide-angle lenses and panoramic landscapes. In fact the golden age of the car chase probably began in 1968 with "Bullitt" and ended in 1980 with "Blues Brothers." This movie definitely earns a place on the top of the list... the Dodge Challenger spends the bulk of the movie flying over roads and defying the laws of gravity.Cleavon Little is brilliant here as Super Soul, a blind radio DJ who is somehow plugged in to Kowalski and able to communicate with him over the airwaves. The scene in which the two have a conversation over the radio is brilliant. So are the 70's counter-culture archetypes: the free speed from a stoned biker, the long-haired Jesus freaks, the naked blond on a motorcycle who offers sex as a conversation starter... What more could you ask for? "Vanishing Point" is a crisp, lean, crackling movie that can be enjoyed on many levels... just thinking about it makes me want to pop some uppers and head for the desert.GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when i was in second grade. I was watching the speed channel with my dad and this had come on after American muscle car. I instantly liked it as soon as i'd seen that 426 challenger. Most people talk about the symbolism of this movie, it definitely has some, but i only caught on to that aspect when my dad bought the VHS for me and i watched it almost once a week and began to notice these things. All that aside i just loved the sound of the car, the music, his love for being on the open road and being a free man. This movie is what cemented my love for cars, and my whole lifestyle as a car crazy s.o.b. I thought the scene where he left the bar where he bought all that speed and stomped on it past that fence and you just get immersed into the whole movie. From there on i was hooked, and it only gets better as the movie progresses. The wild cop chase, the race with the jaguar, super soul, and finally winds down to the dozers. If you ever get a chance to see this movie and love cars take your opportunity and enjoy it, because this movie may change your whole life as it did mine. And if your seeing viggo mortensen driving that white challenger you are watching the wrong version but don't turn it off because you still get tho see and hear that challenger as well as a nice black 69 charger taking part in the chasing action. I hope you enjoy the move as much as i did if any of you ever see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, albeit with flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vanishing Point is a film that combines the sprawling south-western landscapes and late 60's/ early 70s counter-culture backdrop of Easy Rider with the visceral car chase sequences of Bullitt and The French Connection. The Film follows Kowalski(Barry Newman), a 30-something ex-cop turned road racer/car delivery man, in his cross country quest to drive a 1970 Dodge Challenger from Denver to a customer in San Fransisco. Fueled by Benzedrine, Kowalski leads police on a car chase of epic proportions in his quest to archive total freedom behind the wheel.This 1971 cult classic Delivers on thrills along with providing the viewer stunning shots of the American southwest that are sure to stick with you long after watching the film. Baby-boomer's will be sure to find the films grungy hippie aesthetics and groovy soundtrack a nostalgic reminder of their adolescence. Younger viewers will be able to appreciate the film as a period piece reflecting the clash of free loving 60's ideology with that of the conservative law enforcement in the south's rural areas.The movie, however, is defiantly not for everyone. Sarafian chooses to tell the story of his counter culture hero in a very visual style, leaving dialogue sequences few and far between. Kowalski himself is only engaging in dialogue a few times over the course of the entire film, including a memorable scene in which Kowalski carries on a conversation involving a blind disk jockey with whom he seems to share an almost telepathic link. At times this leaves the film feeling a little bit slow for modern viewer tastes.Overall, movie lovers will find Vanishing Point to be visually appealing, albeit with an at times slow pace and generally sparse dialogue. Flaws that if you can get past will leave you with an entertaining diamond in the rough from the early 70's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vanishing Point (1971) Kowalski, the hero of the story, works for a carRichard Sarafian's 1971 film "Vanishing Point" is, for starters, a fascinating study of those persons anthropologists sometimes term "marginal men"--individuals caught between two powerful and competing cultures, sharing some important aspects of both but not a true part of either, and, as such, remain tragically confined to an often-painful existential loneliness. Inhabiting a sort of twilight zone between "here" and "there," a sort of peculiar purgatory, these restless specters cannot find any peace or place, so they instead instinctively press madly on to some obscure and unknown destination, the relentless journey itself being the only reason and justification.Disc jockey Super Soul (Cleavon Little) and delivery driver Kowalski (Barry Newman) are two of these specters, marginal but decent, intelligent men who can't or won't live in burgeoning competing cultures which in reality have offered them very little of worth or substance, despite their own personal sacrifices. Kowalski himself had tried to "fit in" with the Establishment as a soldier and police officer and later, attempted to do the same with the blossoming 1960s counterculture, but soon disappointingly found that they both were ridden with their own various forms of dishonesty and insincerity. Personal honor, self-reliance and genuine respect--Kowalski's stock in trade--were tragically valued very little by either, despite each one's shrill and haughty claims to the contrary.Moreover, it's no accident Newman's character has a Polish surname; the Poles throughout their history have created a very rich and unique Slavic culture largely based upon just such a "marginality"--being geographically jammed between powerful historic enemies, Germany and Russia, and never being able to fully identify with either one, at often great cost to themselves. It's also no accident Little's character is blind and black, the only one of his kind in a small, all-Caucasian western desert town--his blindness enhancing his persuasiveness and his ability to read Kowalski's mind, the radio microphone his voice, his race being the focus of long simmering and later suddenly explosive disdain--all of the characteristics of a far-seeing prophet unjustly (but typically) dishonored in his own land.The desert environment also plays a key role in cementing the personal relationship between and respective fates of these two men--to paraphrase British novelist J.G. Ballard, prophets throughout our history have emerged from deserts of some sort since deserts have, in a sense, exhausted their own futures (like Kowalski himself had already done) and thus are free of the concepts of time and existence as we have conventionally known them (as Super Soul instinctively knew, thus creating his own psychic link to the doomed driver.) Everything is somehow possible, and yet, somehow nothing is.Finally, a unique requiem for a quickly dying age- a now all-but-disappeared one of truly open roads, endless speed for the joy of speed's sake, of big, solid no-nonsense muscle cars, of taking radical chances, of living on the edge in a colorful world of endless possibility, seasoned with a large number and wide variety of all sorts of unusual characters, all of which had long made the USA a wonderful place--and sadly is no longer, having been supplanted by today's swarms of sadistic, military-weaponed cop-thugs, obsessive and intrusive safety freaks, soulless toll plazas, smug yuppie SUV drivers, tedious carbon-copy latte towns, and a childish craving for perfect, high-fuel-efficiency safety and security.Topping it off is a great soundtrack, breathtaking cinematography and direction, and automotive action that has seen no equal. This film manages to be both compelling and exciting.Just watch it already.* Charlotte Rampling had a role as a hitchhiker whom Kowalski met while en route, but her scenes were deleted before the US release. The scenes were re-inserted for the UK release. The DVD release includes both the US and UK versions.* The car featured in the film is a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T, with a 440 cubic-inch V-8, and not a 426 Hemi V-8 (as is often believed). Five white Challengers loaned from the Chrysler Corporation were used during the filming.* The Challenger had Colorado plates: OA-5599* There was actually four 440 Challenger R/Ts and one 383 Challenger R/T, which was an automatic with green interior. This one was used for some exterior shots and it pulled the 1967 Camaro up to speed so the Camaro could hit the bulldozers. As confirmed by property master Dennis J. Parrish, all of the cars were NOT originally white. They were just painted white for the film. During the scene where Kowalski has a flat tire, you can see green paint in the dents.* Cameo: David Gates - The singer/songwriter (of Bread fame) played the piano during the rousing revival in the desert with the J. Hovah singers.* The names of the cities on the California Highway Patrol tracking board (where Kowalski never made it) were Stockton, Oakland, Berkeley and San Francisco.* Director Richard C. Sarafian's original choice for the role of Kowalski was Gene Hackman, but the studio, 20th Century Fox, insisted on using Barry Newman if the movie was going to be made.* The color white was chosen for the car simply so the car would stand out against the background scenery in the movie. White was not symbolic in any way. The director says this in the DVD commentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1970's "ZEN' type thinkpiece which is so out of date today that I can hardly believe we watched these movies. 1970 Challenger is star of the movie without doubt. Various cop cars are also large part of the appeal of this movie for me. Story line is so stupid that it barely deserves mention, let alone become the inspiration of the insipid 90's version of Vanishing Point. Remakes of these movies are a travesty of the original's intent such as the ridiculous remake of "Gone In 60 Seconds" which in it's original 1974 version was almost a documentary of HB Halicki's life. Quit looking for spiritual enlightenment in this escapist movies and enjoy them for the high-octane enjoyment they provide from the days of .30 per gallon hi-test.</fullReview>

I last saw the movie a few years ago on TV (HBO/SHO/or something) in scene 21, Angel's offer, there was an indoor scene where he followed Angel inside as she goes to get the tobacco, and before she brings out her clipping collection. I remember her asking something like "You don't remember me do you..." Then in a later TV showing, it wasn't there. Since the DVD has both US and UK releases, I thought it would include the missing footage. But it does not, on either cut.Did I dream the indoor footage? As I recall, the dialog therein added a lot of backstory to the apparent relationship between Kowalski and Angel. But I'm starting to think it never happened, since neither cut has it.Is there possibly a third version around somewhere? Nat</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glorious demonstration of speed and action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vanishing Point is one of the most original and inventive films that I've seen. It manages to avoid any pretentiousness and also shirks annoying Hollywood schmaltz. The basic plot is of Kowalski, an ex-cop and racing driver, who bets his pal a few bucks that he can deliver a Dodge Challenger across the States in record time. Eager to win the bet he refuses to stop when flagged down by a motorcycle policeman and so a chase ensues that develops over the rest of the film, growing ever grander in scale and intensity. With awesome V8 power under the bonnet, Kowalski can outrun most of his pursuers and we get treated to some sensational car chase scenes through desert highways in the blazing sun. The Dodge Challenger sounds truly amazing and I defy any petrolhead to find a better engine note than an American 60s or 70s V8 engine, back then they really knew how to make a motor! Kowalski quickly becomes a national hero and villain to separate sections of the community. His cause is championed by SuperSoul, a DJ who offers him advice and news over the radio. Highlights of the film include Kowalski racing against a flash Jag E-Type, meeting an old flame who rides naked through the desert on a motorbike and a crazy encounter with an old snake rustler who introduces him to some very odd Christians! The ending to the film is very sudden and exciting. I'm glad that the director resisted the temptation to finish with a clich in which Kowalski drives off serenely into the distance. Vanishing Point is a highly atmospheric and engaging movie that will keep you entertained from start to finish so if you haven't seen it, grab a copy soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part of My Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was working when suddenly the image of the end of the film popped up in my head from nowhere. Haven't seen it for maybe 20 years. I guess I saw it so young, it became part of my life completely not-understood. And that might be a big plus, since searching for meaning in such a film may well be the biggest spoiler. Hey - it was made because there was a new car out. And, yes, that explains a lot. It just used the Hippie world as background, and just because it was made in the 70ies without too much thought, it became just that, so 70ies.But I just loved the car. And while I didn't 'understand' the scene with the girl on the motorcycle - the air of being detached was coming across 100%. He is a loner, he doesn't stay. No matter, why. Nothing happens. And that's the point.The trespassing of the social agree abilities is evolving logically within the story, from start to finish. It grounds the film surprisingly in the end after simmering in the realms of tale for a while. It reconfirms that the whole topic is very real. You can go as far as you want. Hippies probably weren't too scared of anything. And many an explorer went 'too far' on trips less graphical. This car commercial is a clean, wise parable, telling the story of speed and limits. It's a masterpiece for its simplicity. Beg your pardon, yeah, I think in my heart I understood a lot from it. B5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have seen this movie about 6 times in all, and have thoroughly enjoyed it every time. First time was back in1972, when our local station ran it, unedited. It certainly made an impression on my 15 y.o. mind! Being that young, I could not grasp all the symbolism of the movie, although I certainly "got" the young lady on the motorcycle! At the time, the speed and power of the Dodge Challenger R/T was really something to see, and it is still as enjoyable today, as it was back then. This movie is The Mother of all Chase Movies. Rent it and see it, for a look back at early 1970's. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got done watching this early 70's counter culture hit on cable and I must say, in a drollfully respectful way, it is a product of its time. Kowlaski, the lone, burned out, ex-racecar driver must deliver a Charger from Colorado to San Francisco in a few days. Once Kowalski accepts the assignment as it were, something crosses over in him and this job becomes a statement against everything he once believed in. Barry Newman in all his liberal, Jewish, and self serving pride rallies against authority, in all its irrational, bigoted, conservative, and racist forms. We see Kowalski become the cause celebre for many people who urge him on to victory with Cleavon Little's Super Soul DJ being the most ardent and vocal admirer. As the film comes to a crashing (sorry!) yet expected end (which really comes as no surprise since many of the films of the period ended on downbeat but reasonable denouements) Kowalski is heralded as a symbol whose independent spirit will never die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A guy driving a white Dodge Challenger is being chased by helicopters and cop cars. Further down the road, at a town's entrance, cops are setting up a road block with dozers no less.We then start at the beginning. The driver is to deliver the gorgeous Challenger in San Francisco, he takes some speed as he offers to be there sooner than anyone expects. At first it looks like he's driving leisurely but cops on motorcycles ask him to pull over and he drives them off the road. The chase is on, spanning Colorado, Nevada, and California. On the way he meets a guy who collects snakes in the middle of the desert and exchanges them for food with snakecharming Christians. He further meets a pretty gas station attendant, a biker and his pretty nude girl, two homosexuals who are actually out to grab him for the police, a pretty hitchhiker in the night. Wherever he goes he asks for drugs, and all the women he meets have a thing for him, even though he doesn't have a lot to say about anything.While this is going on we meet a black radio dj who is blind, has an affinity for the driver's "cause" (whatever that may be) and has a special talent/connection with the driver. He knows what the cops are up to, he engages in a "conversation" with the driver hearing what he answers to his questions.Little by little we also learn about the driver's past in flashbacks. He used to be a moral cop who stopped a colleague from raping a girl they arrested. He was a good race car driver. He had a surfer girlfriend who died.None of this changes his inevitable path, and he doesn't seem to care. Perhaps it's the drugs, the endless driving in the desert, but he acts as if wherever he goes there will be a way out, a shortcut, a dirt road he can take.Vanishing Point is a surprisingly empty movie. The driving scenes are OK for the time I guess, although something tells me the stunts could have been better. There's not a whole lot of accidents and mayhem, just a lot of driving and scenes of the guy's empty expression. To make this tolerable we get a whole lot of loud music instead of various genres. I would like to have seen more of the small towns and their people- we just get short glances.What surprised me was how little Hollywood has changes over the decades. In a way this movie has everything that Hollywood is criticized for- it portrays easy drug use, gratuitous (but welcome) nudity, white evil racist cops, stereotypical blacks, superficiality. Given how famous this movie is, I sure expected more depth, more meaning.</fullReview>

We can see an unstoppable quest of liberty from the hero, but the acting is really poor and the background story of the main character seem to have been forgotten to the profit of car chase scenes.If you like action movies, you better go for big blockbusters rather than go for this one. The other characters are basic stereotypes of Hippies or cops and don't come with anything interesting to add to the movie.The story in itself is far from original, you better pass your way on this movie.</fullReview>

The story is not very important. The point are emotions. Searches. Slices of hope. And the warm expectation. A film in which the spectator is part. Not another actor but a small bone of show. A show who exists in himself. So, it is not possible to be the outsider. Beautiful in a form without words,"Vanishing Point" is a interesting lesson about appearances and masks. About the cruelty of past and the red of present. About run and the Japanese refuge. About the death like huge shadow and the truth as oil drop.</fullReview>

Although i've gotten close to that point in my life, the bulldozers are still on the horizon.

		<shortDescription>Almost lives up to its killer cult reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the all-time big deal early 70's youth cult movies, a fairly obvious, but extremely potent "Easy Rider" spin-off which combines the once popular, now hopelessly pass profound existential road movie parable exploring the slowly waning late 60's hippie counterculture with the terse and more straightforward chase thriller. The net result of this unusual and intriguing mixture is a generally up to par picture which for the most part lives up to its killer cult reputation.Barry Newman, all tense, tautly coiled, tight-lipped intensity and sullenly brooding attitude, gives a solid, compelling performance as Kowalski, a dour, taciturn, refractory former cop, onetime race car driver and Vietnam vet who's become a bitter, speed pill-popping nonconformist societal drop-out. Kowalski makes a bet with his bennie connection that he can drive a souped-up Dodge Challenger from Denver, Colorado to San Francisco, California in a mere fifteen hours. Kowalski tears his bound and determined way towards his targeted destination, incurring the spiteful wrath of the police in three states in the process. The pigs give dogged chase. Ultra-cool, jive-talking, rhythm and blues loving blind black disc jockey Super Soul ( a perfectly funky, shoot-the-fireworks hysterical slice of fat, juicy, scenery-scarfing ham from Cleavon Little) finds out about Kowalski and decides to help out, declaring that Kowalski represents the "last beautiful free soul on this planet" and subsequently making him a much admired countercultural celebrity.Director Richard Sarafian keeps this quickly paced, handsomely made oddball film nicely humming throughout, occasionally pausing for some curious flashbacks into Kowalski's troubled past (one entailing Kowalski's beachside romance with his old lady, complete with crashing waves and hideously cloying orchestral music, is embarrassingly atrocious). Alas, the dialogue tends to be horribly affected and thus hard on the ears ("speed means freedom of the soul") and the extraneous, often disruptive flashbacks only clutter up an otherwise compact and gripping narrative. Furthermore, the insights into Kowalski's past prevent "Vanishing Point" from becoming more challenging and philosophical; they ground Kowalski too much in drab everyday reality -- he would have been a more effective "*beep* the system" anti-hero if his motives had remained obscure. Still, there's plenty of good stuff to be found and enjoyed here: a terrific rock score (the winsome flower child folk-pop duo Delaney and Bonnie, with a pig-tailed Rita Coolidge supplying background vocals, make a brief on-screen appearance while the songs themselves were written by such diverse artists as Jerry Reed and Kim Carnes), beautifully dusty and desolate desert locations, several seriously smoking car chase scenes, a suitably gritty, rough-edged look, a truly startling and quintessentially 70's uncompromising downbeat ending, and exquisite panoramic cinematography by John A. Alonzo (the grand sweeping crane pans and breathtaking overhead helicopter shots are quite sumptuous). Appearing in nifty small roles are Paul Koslo and Robert Donner as two of Kowalski's fuzzball pursuers, John Amos as Super Soul's assistant, perennial bad guy Anthony James as a slimy, effeminate homosexual highway bandit, the ever-quirky and delightful Severn Darden as a smug, phony roadside preacher, the lovely, willowy Gilda Texter in the totally ridiculous role of a cute blonde motorcycle mama who rides around the hot, sweltering desert completely naked on a motorcycle (!), and, in an especially fine, colorful bit, veteran character actor Dean Jagger as a cagey, crusty old desert rat who collects rattlesnakes. All in all, a pretty flawed, but still worthwhile flick which deserves its fervent fan following.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend brought 'Vanishing Point' over last night and convinced me to watch it based on how he perceived it watching it 34 years ago. Well, maybe 34 years ago it was topical (Vietnam, Police corruption, sexual freedom), insightful and exciting, but in 2005 it's just boring. The direction and editing of the film make it difficult to care about any of the characters so when the 'surprise' ending (think Thelma and Louise) comes it doesn't engender any emotion. I watched some of it (2nd time thru) with the commentary on, hoping for some hidden meaning I missed. Even with the commentary on it was putting me to sleep.On the other hand, I believe the director was correct that some parts of his film inspired other directors (Spielberg in Duel) and story lines (Thelma &amp; Louise).Four out of 10, mostly for the 70's throwback chic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They say it's the ultimate car chasing movie... They are RIGHT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kowalski's the name? First, last and only. He's the silent 'Last American' anti-hero who makes up in charisma what he lacks in communicative skills. Kowalski works as a delivery driver and has to transport a car, the notoriously far-out cool white 1970 Dodge Challenger, from Denver to San Francisco. To make life somewhat more exciting and "challenging", he makes a bet with his local speed-supplier and claims to be able to complete the trip within 15 hours of time. Suffice to say winning this bet will require a lot of exceeding the speed limits, taking impressive shortcuts through the Nevada desert and pulling spectacular car stunts. It doesn't take too long before our hero Kowalski is chased by the highway patrol troops of no less than three states, but simultaneously he encounters a handful of people that support his "freedom" mission, like the blind radio DJ Super Soul and a couple of amiable (and naked) hippies. "Vanishing Point" was on my personal must-see list since several years already, but watching QT's "Death Proof" recently accelerated my purchase. That movie truly glorifies this archetypical 70's cult-treasure, and with good reason! "Vanishing Point" contains some of the most exhilarating chase-sequences ever captured on film (and they're purely old-fashioned stunt work, no dreadful computer animation), John A. Alonzo's exterior photography is sublime, the soundtrack is stimulating, all characters are intriguing and worth exploring and ? like no other contemporary achievement ? the film breathes the rebellious atmosphere of the early 70's. Quite a lot of people claim that "Vanishing Point", albeit being an entertaining picture, hasn't got much of a plot. Well, I beg to differ, as Kowalski's journey is much more meaningful and his character much more engaging than superficially appears. The further his Dodge takes him (* extra spoiler warning *), the more you begin to realize Kowalski is an embittered person and his silly bet might even by an easy excuse to cover up a grotesque suicide attempt. Multiple flashbacks enlighten us regarding Kowalski's past: he was sent on a tour of Duty in 'Nam, he failed as a police officer because he was too honest, he lost a girlfriend in a surfing accident and survived a couple of harsh crashes on racing circuits. He definitely isn't an empty-headed macho prick in an astonishingly awesome car, but a true cult-movie anti hero. "Vanishing Point" righteously ranks among the greatest cult movies ever made and it's one of those cases where you really want to BE the lead character. If I'd be struggling through a midlife-crisis right now, I'd go out and buy myself a genuine Dodge Challenger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know I can not really answer the question that is posed to cross-country car deliverer, Kowalski(Barry Newman)towards the end of the film by a man he made a daring, ridiculous bet with stating he could take a car from Colorado to California in 15 hours, but there's no doubt in my mind, he knew the answer as he drives his car into certain death in the final climactic scene. You might wish to wring my neck for just tossing the climax to you in such a forward way, but I don't think most viewers will expect Kowalski to make that deadline after committing the felonies he breaks along the way. There's a look on Kowalski's face that shows peace with this smile of almost gratitude for having made his long journey. Or, at least that's the way I gaged his reaction at the end as he knew his time was up.The question is..Why even bother trying to make an exhausting trip so far in such a short time to begin with? I have my opinion as I'm sure others do. Perhaps, the film offers to each individual a chance to make their own mind up regarding why our hero decides he must try and achieve the impossible task he sets out for. I felt it was a way of proving to himself he could achieve something to fulfill an unsatisfied existence that has been, for the most part(I'm speaking in regards to the flashback sequences offered us sprinkled throughout the film), full of tragedy and sadness. I think the film appears at the start to be just a racing-against-time chase film with cops in hot pursuit, but it takes on a greater meaning to me anyways. Cleavon Little has an interesting role as Super Soul(an interesting name, isn't it?). He's a deejay who almost becomes K's spiritual guide along the way. K represents something to different people. Some look at him as the "last American dream", others as nutty as a fruitcake. I think he's only on this journey for himself--this calm exterior hides loneliness I think and loss(the young lover who dies in a surfing mishap;seeing a young druggie almost raped by a cop-partner he had on the force). I think the loneliness part is briefly fulfilled by Charlotte Rampling's mysterious hitchhiker(her scenes were cut in the American version, but I watched the European one)towards the end.I love the film for what it shows..the American landscape allowing a car and it's driver room to navigate and live. In the time-span available, K does just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for its cult appeal and 70's cool, but otherwise it is a pretty vacuous affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kowalski is an ex-cop and former professional racing driver who now works delivering cars. After arriving back at the garage after a cross-country trip, he immediately takes another car for delivery to San Francisco, takes a hit of speed and heads off. Despite having plenty of time to make the delivery, Kowalski has made a bet with his dealer that he can do it in 15 hours. With the underground supporting him and the cops chasing him, our dead-eyed hero heads off into the desert seemingly uncaring of the fate that awaits him.This film is one that you seem to know what you're getting into before you watch it if you want to enjoy it because it is not a mainstream film but rather one that will serve a smaller cult audience better. I don't mean that in the modern sense of the word (where 'cult' films are those that student adopt or ones that fanboys rave about) but rather a film that some people will love while many others will wonder what the fuss was ever about.This is not a snobbish point of view because I am one of those who just didn't see the appeal. Plotwise the film could almost be called minimalist if it weren't for the terribly handled flashbacks supposedly giving us a deeper understanding of Kowalski. The story, for all it is, sees our hero driving with pure abandon to his goal for no other reason than a cheap bet. This aspect of the film is interesting enough on its own but it is not enough to base the whole film on.However this may also form its appeal to the right audience and some viewers may love the way that it is all so bare and cool ? with Kowalski's devil may care attitude serving as an appealing role model for disaffected youth, but it just wasn't enough to hold my attention. Without a decent script or engaging plot, what I was left with was a rather dull film that was aimed at a small audience that didn't seem to include me with my old fashioned desire for plotting and narrative! Others may enjoy reading all sorts of spiritual meaning into it but it came across as an empty idea reaching as opposed to being designed. Newman has a sort of tough cool that fits with the film but, with nothing really to do, he simply fits with the film and delivers a moody mysterious performance that is entirely superficial. Little was a surprise find for me but other than adding 70's cool and funk he didn't do much else. The rest of the cast have even less to do in very little screen time and it is no surprise that they make almost no impression.Overall this is not a terrible film but it is one that has more cult appeal than anything else. It is blessed with 70's cool and the bare plot means that you can find whatever meaning in it that you desire, although the obvious religious meaning just seemed silly and forced to me! Worth seeing once because you may be one of those who find it 'cool' and don't see the weaknesses past that and I'm sure many will like it for its counterculture coolness but I'm afraid it was nothing more than a curio to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly, it works as a whole and not just because the cool car chases</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And when I say "surprisingly" I don't want to mean I was expecting something plain bad with great and real car chases. I think I'm not alone confessing I first heard about VANISHIG POINT when I watched Tarantino's DEATH PROOF (I'm a Audioslave fan but so even if it turned to be plain bad but with the car chases living up to the reputation (checar si en dp dicen si es una de las mas grandes movies americanos) I would have been completely pleased. Turned out the car chases only happen in the beginning of the film, good stuff with the main character ? () and his ? teaching some driving lessons to every cop that tries to stop them (and also to every driver that challenge them!), but, and I don't want to sound disrespectful, the last car chase in DEATH PROOF is much more intense and more cool. The surprises began when I didn't see the very best car chases ever (obviously not very good news but I can't use "bad news" since those scenes are darn good, only not very impressive) and continued as the movie advanced, which is good news.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hey Kowalski, you out there?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kowalski is a driver. It's all he's known whether from his former life as stock car driver or a policeman. Driving is in his blood. His new job is delivering cars across the country. His assignment is to take a Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco. And Kowalski intends to do it in record time. It's not long before Kowalski has the police from four states hot on his trail.There's really not a lot you can write about Vanishing Point without first discussing the film's finale. And, it's almost impossible to discuss the ending of Vanishing Point without giving it away. I'll try not to give too much away, but it will be difficult. Vanishing Point is as nihilistic a movie as I've seen. Why did Kowalski do what he did? And why does Kowalski even have to get to San Francisco in such a hurry? The way I see it, the two are related in Kowalski's desire for freedom. He does what he does at the end of the movie to express the ultimate freedom. Also, in Kowalski world view, driving represents freedom. He is driving from Denver to San Francisco because that's what he does ? he drives. It may not be the way you or I see the world, but it's Kowalski's way. Beyond the ending, Vanishing Point is a fascinating movie. If you don't think you would find scene after scene of a 1970 Alpine White Dodge Challenger going down the highway exciting, Vanishing Point might not be a good choice for you. I'll admit, however, that once he reached the vast, limitless desert, I began to worry that I might also lose interest. But it's these seemingly endless scenes interrupted by Kowalski's flashbacks or a chance meeting with a stranger that make the ending so powerful. There's no predicting what's about to come. It's an awesome experience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the movie is rather easy to understand provided you understand what a car means to a person and like anti-heros.kowalski's flashbacks through out the movie are there to set the foundation of why hes running and what kind of a man he is.yes super soul is in kowalski's head.the naked chick is simple sex appeal no real meaning in her appearance other than to show yet another person to whom kowalski has affected. the faith healers are simply there for 2 reasons one being to showcase the band being shown and the other to show why the old man was in the desert gathering up snakes when kowalski found him. of course it didn't hurt that after all his running kowalski needed gas and the preacher man provided him with some.now as to those who don't understand why kowaski's running he has to deliver the challenger to san fran by monday.kowalski's job is to deliver cars[they used to do that back then] and as hes on his way he stops to buy speed from his dealer/friend.a bet is presented that he can get to his destination by monday or he'll not only pay for his speed but pay double next trip he takes. the flashbacks present a man who has tried and lost at everything he has done,but not because hes bad nor stupid but because he is a loser at life.this trip is his chance to not only prove himself but to also chase his demons away.the title refers to the point where the person stops and the ideal takes over ie: kowalski will not be stopped by the police or knowing that he simply cant get to san fran so kowalski the man vanishes and the ideal of "im going the distance" takes over and if that distance happens to be from the road to the front of a bulldozer so be it.he will have accomplished his true goal to "win one' as in the cops didn't stop him. he went as far as he wanted and they couldn't do anything about it therefore he won.70's oddness sure but still good viewing. of course that is if you're not so highbrow you cant enjoy the more base elements, muscle car's roaring around the open road,running from the cops,some vintage T@A and drugs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie, I had read a lot about it. I'm a car-enthusiast, and in a lot of car magazines this movie is praised for the action that takes place on the road.The main character, Kowalski, is very convincing, but the real star in the movie for me was obviously the beautiful bright white Dodge. The sound it makes is unbelievable, and the car is slipping and sliding all over the road (and sometimes offroad).The movie in itself isn't bad either. In the beginning you see a part of the end of the movie, but you don't see the ending of that sequence. Through the entire movie, I was curious what would happen to our anti-hero at the end.If you like cars and haven't seen this movie: GO SEE IT! If you're not a car fanatic, it is quite a good movie.9/10 in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a 'cult' film, an extended car chase movie with little plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens with seeming random shots of dry, dusty and dilapidated small towns in the west, where residents often observe passing traffic. This sets the stage for the country the movie's protagonist will travel through. Barry Newman is Kowalski, and we learn that he works as a courier of sorts, driving between Denver and San Francisco. On this particular trip, he bets a friend that he can make it in 15 hours. On the way, when certain events remind him of the past, we learn that he once was a competitive motorcycle racer, an auto racer, and a cop. He also lost the love of his life in a surfing tragedy. With bad feelings for many of his prior experiences, he averts all attempts by the cops to catch him for his speeding and reckless driving.Cleavon Little has an interesting role as blind radio DJ Super Soul, and he somehow monitors Kowalski's progress and broadcasts it to the amazement of the locals. Kowalski meets a number of interesting characters along the way, perhaps the most interesting only known as 'Nude Motorcycle Rider' (Gilda Texter), the girlfriend of a motorcyclist who helps Kowalski. Wearing nothing but her tan, she stands for a while next to a car, talking to Kowalski, offering him anything he wants, but all he asks for was a cigarette. Ms. Texter was not much of an actress and, interestingly, she has gone on to have a good career as a costume designer! For a normal sized woman she has very small breasts, which was not considered a detraction back then. Today actresses seem to be obsessed with having large breasts.MAJOR SPOILER. At the beginning of the movie, we see cops at one town placing the blades of two Earth-movers in the middle of the road to stop Kowalski. But when he arrives he speeds ahead, directly into them and dies in a massive crash and burn. As a viewer I can assume that he had given up on life, with a sort of 'Thelma and Louise' ending so that he wouldn't spend time in jail. But I don't consider this a very good movie, just an interesting one from the early 1970s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting seventies cult film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I have to admit that Vanishing Point didn't do as much for me as it evidently did for other people, but I can see why this film does have a cult following. The film is pretty much your 'classic' seventies car film, as it features plenty of car chases as well as the standard backdrop of desert and open road. The film obviously takes a lot of influence from the sixties classic Easy Rider in that we follow the fortunes of a central character that exists outside of the society norm. Kowalski is the man in question, and he is given the task of taking a 1970 Dodge Challenger from Colorado to the California. He then takes a bet that he can get the car to it's destination in just fifteen minutes. It later transpires that Kowalski is both an ace driver and wanted by the police, and soon his journey across America is being interrupted by various parties, including the cops, who seem very keen on chasing him around the country. His plight soon gets a lot of media attention, and his only allay is a blind radio DJ with a police scanner...This film wasn't really what I was expecting. I was hoping that Vanishing Point would be more comparable to seventies car flicks such as The Driver, but the film unfortunately is nowhere near that entertaining. That's not to say that Vanishing Point is by any means boring; it certainly does have a lot going for it, although I do have to say that certain parts really drag and since there aren't many characters that are easy to care for, the film becomes very easy to turn yourself off to. The style and feel of the film is it's strongest asset, and director Richard C. Sarafian does a good job of capturing the classic seventies tone. I have to say I wasn't all that impressed with the central performance from Barry Newman. The lead actor lacks charisma and since this movie isn't exactly plot heavy, that does become a problem. However, there are a lot of pluses for the film; chief among them being the car chases, which tend to be the star of any film involving cars, and this one is no different. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone; but if you're a fan of seventies cult, you might find something to like about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Vanishing Point when it first came out and really enjoyed it. But then again, I was 16 years old and fairly easy to impress. In retrospect, this film has all the flaws of an independent film coupled with poor acting and a superfluous plot. Can someone really take all those drugs and still drive like that? NO. Our rebel no only didn't have a cause, he really didn't have a point. ( Maybe that's how this film got it's name?) But at 16 who needs a point. We wanted fast cars, sex, rock n' roll and at that time some of the people I knew even wanted drugs.I'm glad to say my taste has matured. Today, I only want fast cars, sex and rock n' roll.

Maybe not right for everybody, and just subtle enough (I guess) that most wouldn't get it. But that's what it is. He is working through his own mortal struggle as his destiny draws close. That's why Jake Kowalski half heartedly waves off such worldly factors such as police tickets, friendship, and even at times, drugs. Notice the disinterest or distraction in his face to something unseen outwardly. He has one foot in our world, and one foot in the next, the kingdom of Jesus. (No I'm not a religious fanatic, or even a very religious Christian, but its obvious to me just the same and I respect what I see as what is the real message). We all know that the Lord works in mysterious ways!!</fullReview>

There is also some nudity if memory serves me correctly. If you are going to have a car movie, there should always be lots of full frontal nudity. Big breasted hippie chicks make it even better. It also helps to have a smooth talking DJ egging on the driver. In this story you have am awesome car, and some wired out dude, assigned to take the car across country. Add full frontal nudity and there is your movie. It helps if this is all it takes for you to enjoy a movie. Oh and one more thing, when you watch this movie turn it up, so you can really appreciate the roar of the Challenger.</fullReview>

Back in the 70's/early 60's, it was enough to be black to provoke an attack such as this. I am a white male, only 21 yo, and yet, I know this. It is in the fabric of our culture. A black man was trying to do something meaningful, or simply just trying to be one of the people. Certain racist white men don't like this so much. They would rather die than ever hear a black man's voice over the radio, much less a black man's voice over the radio challenging the status quo. This event in the film is to portray the challenges that were faced by the people of color in our society; that the simplest form of support or voice of opinion is regarded with such hate and misunderstanding by those who hate simply on basis of color.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exciting film with good car scenes going at high speed, and a man trying to win a long distance in a short period of time. To accomplish what he bet to be able to do, he had to go at high prohibited speed in American highways. The police started immediately hunting him, but without any success. In his way he was helped by a gay and a naked woman as well as by radio communication with some of his friends. At certain point when he was already reaching California he was advised to stop by his friend but he continued to a final crash. The film probably wanted to show a person who was looking for a kind of freedom, he personally was a good man, experienced in Vietman war and also as a decent policeman. This is a film typically reflecting the feelings of young people of 60-70s in US and other western societies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't understand the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Born in the mid seventies, I always have some special memories from this period. I know a lot of movies were made in this era that are classics. I never heard of Vanishing Point until I saw Death Proof, second movie from Grindhouse were the same car is being featured. And since someone referred to this film I had to check it out for myself.I must admit that were some great stunts in this one. If you encounter a lunatic like Kowalski on the road how would you react? It is then funny to witness that the main character in the white dodge is perceived as a hero. Apparently it seems that everybody from that period who took a stand against authority was a hero. But Kowalski isn't a hero he (Barry Newman) was just dangerous. And for a former cop and a professional race driver he sure drove like a madman. He didn't seem in control of the steering wheel. Maybe Kowalski was tired and and he had enough but the path he chose wasn't heroic at all. It could very well be that there were some reasons and motivations for driving like he does. But we never get to know them so why should I care. I was hoping for some great chase sequences and truly dazzling stunts. Or why else would so many people be praising this film. But apart from a few nice stunts these aren't present. The whole film is basically about a man driving from point A to point B without offering much else. Many fans of this film will have let you believe that so much more is going on. That it is meaningful and deep. Why does every film where drugs play a large role in events is being claimed as the second coming? Just because drugs can alter and warp the way you think does not always mean it's good or enlightening. I am not anti drugs or anything but we do have to be real and admit why most people resort to drugs and alcohol. Apart from making them feel good these substances offer an escape from reality. From time to time that can help you deal with things if it gets too much for you. However don't pretend that using will give you the answers you seek. Most of the time it won't. But here you have fans who claim otherwise and try to preach the non existent gospel of the film like in text beneath. " So maybe this has been covered already. But since this movie is basically a flashback, he is already dead, that part is not disputable. However, I think, his journey, through the desert, is actually his trip through purgatory. Everyone he meets is basically a lost soul, but they are helping him on his destination. His wife was already dead from the surfing accident. Like Dante, he is traveling through purgatory to find his love. He is constantly tempted to be untrue, the gas station attendant and the nude girl, but he refuses. At the end, he see the light, between the bulldozers, like a tunnel into heaven, he knows on the other end is his lost love." Extracted from wikipedia: Actor Barry Newman (Kowalski) also thought that the entire film was an essay on existentialism. Kowalski drives to drive, with no real purpose for doing what he's doing. He decides to give his life its definition and meaning, with complete freedom over his actions. Director Sarafian explained that he wanted to make Kowalski appear otherworldly and that the world within the film was a temporary existence that he was just making a stop in. At the end of the film, he was ascending from this existence into another. The lyrics of the end song underscore this interpretation: "Nobody knows, nobody sees, till the light of life stops burning, till another soul goes free."Even if above comments are true and director Sarafian wanted to convey this he did a poor job of it. How convenient it is that most of the story and characterization is so abstract that you can make out of it whatever you want without having to prove much. It is this kind of pretension that bothers me. Because it is very easy to be vague and abstract. How often don't we hear that some epic moments in films have been unintentional. And usually have been caused by mistakes like running out of film. How can we be sure that in this case something happened and prevented to film that next scene that would have put everything in perspective? Or perhaps that scene was filmed but that the director decided not to put it in since it would give a too good of explanation that simply might not have been as exciting or mind blowing. How do we know for sure that what eventually is shown in the film has been intentional? Vanishing Point didn't struck a cord with me at all. I am all for substance but then you have to offer something real and nothing something you have to imagine yourself. I know my imagination is huge. However that does not mean storytellers always can get away with excluding their answer to the problems raised. If you want to challenge me then you need to do better than that. Give your answer. I will give mine. And then we can debate it. It is here where we truly learn from each other. In the end Vanishing point is a film about a man driving from point A to point B. Nothing to get excited about.</fullReview>
