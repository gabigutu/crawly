		<shortDescription>A Baffling Oscar Oversight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, the Oscars have often gone to performers and films that seemed to make little sense at the time and subsequently failed to stand the test of time. While Julie Andrews was certainly marked for stardom, her singing nanny did not hold a candle to Kim Stanley's tour-de-force as Myra in "Seance on a Wet Afternoon," either in 1964 or in 2004. One wonders in retrospect if any of the voters actually saw this brilliant, minor masterwork. If they had, how did Richard Attenborough's performance get overlooked? His subtle underplaying as the passive husband is in perfect sync to Stanley's showy turn as the medium and deserved Academy recognition as much as and perhaps more than his direction of "Gandhi." The taut screenplay and direction by Bryan Forbes, the fine black and white cinematography by Gerry Turpin, and John Barry's music also deserved recognition. Unfortunately, Hollywood was into big musicals in 1964, and the Academy's nominations were showered on "My Fair Lady" and "Mary Poppins," while more serious fare such as this film was overlooked. While "Lady" clunks along today as a leaden stage-bound adaptation and "Poppins" does not seem quite as charming as it did, "Seance on a Wet Afternoon" and the two brilliant performances at its center remain as riveting as they were 40 years ago. Fortunately, the Academy has shown some maturity in recent years, and films such as this are more often recognized, which raises their profiles and brings them to the attention of viewers who might otherwise miss them. Without any recognition other than recommendations from those few who have seen this character-driven suspense gem, "Seance" has been little seen and remains a cinematic jewel that awaits discovery and its deserved place among British film classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first hour is one of the most riveting pieces of film ever to hit the screen. The pace, the mood, Attenborough and, of course, Kim Stanley! Then, something happens on the second half, it feels rushed, at least, that's what it felt to me. Once that aside, what a treat! Bryan Forbes signed some startling British movies of that period but you hardly hear his name mentioned. I mean, "Whistle Down The Wind", "The Wrong Box", "The L Shapped Room", "King Rat". Here he touches some kind of zenith. I heard that originally, Forbes and producer Richard Attenborough, had toyed with the idea of making the couple a "queer" one. Alec Guinness and Tom Courtenay. As fun as the idea may sound I'm glad they didn't go ahead with that. It would have deprive us of Kim Stanley and of Richard Attenborough in what could be, arguably, his best performance. He made of Billy's weakness a separate entity. Painful, creepy. Stanley is, goes without saying, sublime. Another superlative characterization in her far too brief film gallery. We can actually see what she's feeling and what she's feeling is so all consuming so strong and so fragile that we feel she's about to fall at any moment and we will too, with her. For those of us who love great acting - This is unmissable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kim Stanley is a knock-off and this film a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an almost forgotten masterpiece by British director Bryan Forbes in which everything is unique.The sound track is macabre and chilling, the story and setting: simply adorable (the atmosphere of the old house is comparable to the one in Wise's "The Haunting"), the cinematography is great, and the editing almost perfect.The greatest plus, whatsoever, is Kim Stanley's acting. Perfection would be the right word to describe it. Regarded as being "America's finest actress", she proves what Method acting can be like in this stunning, electric performance. It's so sad that her filmography is that short! Equally good is Richard Attenborough as Stanley's weak husband. Both actors deliver a tour-de-force duel in acting -- it's great to watch!I highly recommend this film which still -- in times of "Hannibal", and "Scream" -- gives us chills. It's the best entertainment you can get!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Performances in an Unexpected Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unsuccessful psychic and spiritualist has grown frustrated with her lack of celebrity--and so devises a plan to bring herself the fame she craves. She and her husband will kidnap a child. When the police are baffled and press coverage has reached a fevered pitch, she will have a "vision" that will lead to the child's recovery and the reap the rewards of publicity. But no sooner is the plan underway than there are complications--and in this instance the complications are the characters themselves.Everything about Brian Forbes' SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON is understated yet oddly moody. The story, although unusual, is told in a direct sort of way; although it offers an occasional twist, the plot avoids tricky devices. The script is very natural sounding, the black and white cinematography avoids undue cleverness, and the background music is discreet. This throws all attention on the characters--and Kim Stanley and Richard Attenborough offer amazing performances, with Stanley the very personification of rising madness and Attenborough painfully accurate as her emotionally dependent husband.The interplay between Stanley and Attenborough is justly famous, and the two stars are well supported, most particularly by Judith Donner as the kidnapped child and Nanette Newman as her distracted mother. The film has a dreamy, claustrophobic quality that many will find fascinating; some, however, may consider it a bit talky and its conclusion an anticlimax. But if you are in the mood for a psychological thriller that really is psychological, you couldn't pick a better choice for rainy day viewing. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Kim Stanley have won the Oscar?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best British films of the 1960's, "Seance on a Wet Afternoon" is now available on DVD through general distribution. This should help the film to gain the wider appeal that it deserves.This succeeds on all levels - extraordinary direction with riveting tracking shots, evocative cinematography, great set pieces, a winding plot, and amazing acting from the two leads. The showy yet introspective role of Myra Savage might be one to elicit histrionics and stern looks in the wrong hands, but the character is immensely deepened and supplemented by Kim Stanley's superbly rich "Method" performance. Stanley is matched by Richard Attenborough's Bill Savage, attenuated and subordinated by his wife's unstable, grasping personality.Much has been said about Stanley's performance as a deserving Academy Award winner. This is difficult to judge. Most of the awards presented in 1965 were for lighter films, and it is difficult to find fault with Julie Andrew's now legendary performance as "Mary Poppins". Deeper inspection of past Awards shows a predilection toward films of an escapist nature during certain times, such as "Going My Way" during the dark, uncertain days of World War II 1943/1944. Could the same be said of the tumultuous aftermath of Kennedy's assassination and other upheavals? Under any circumstance, this film is a masterpiece with no small debt to the acting of Stanley and Attenborough. Seek this out and you will be richly rewarded - 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent psychological horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This great, seldom-scene movie stars Kim Stanley as an unbalanced woman who holds seances in her home and concocts a plot to gain celebrity with her so-called "powers". With the help of her husband, she plans to kidnap the daughter of a wealthy couple, then use her "powers"to reveal the girl's whereabouts. As the story unfolds, the audience is shown the reasons behind the woman's emotional problems and the growing inevitability of disaster that her plan holds. Richard Attenborough gives a great performance as he teeters between the desire to fulfill his unhappy wife's scheme and the knowledge that the deed they are doing is wrong. Reccommended for those who want a shiver without the gore. Thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Really Good Acting Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assisted by her reluctant husband, a delusional but clever "psychic", with a fondness for opera, carries out a child kidnapping scheme, to help boost her mysticism business. The film's premise is interesting, but the plot is slow and tedious. Many scenes, especially those shot outdoors, could have been shortened, or even deleted. Blatant plot holes and a sputtering finale further weaken the screen story.If the plot is weak, the acting assuredly is not. Richard Attenborough (as the meek husband) is excellent. Even better is Kim Stanley (as the psychotic psychic). Indeed, Stanley's performance, which earned her an Oscar nomination, is the main reason to watch the film. Her method acting is perfect for the role. At times almost whispering her lines, she gives an instinctive and highly mannered performance that reminds me of another method actress, the brilliant Geraldine Page.Mercifully, the film is shot in B&amp;W. The best scenes are interior scenes wherein the stark contrast in lighting combines with minimal dialogue, and at times only the ticking of a clock in lieu of dialogue, to bring about the kind of brooding and dreary atmosphere one would expect, for a psychological thriller.The best approach to this film is to ignore the details of the flawed plot, and focus instead on the psychology and motivation of Kim Stanley's character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An original chiller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing Seance on a Wet Afternoon, before I was teenager. And then seeing it again five or six years later. It still had the same impact watching the movie as I was young child. If this playing on TV tomorrow, I would watch Seance before any TV show. It is an excellent study of characters in story. This is one the movies made me interested in older films. I did not care if the movie was in black and white or color as long as the film is made well. I enjoy for the mysterious atmosphere the movie is set and creativity that the actors bring to their roles. The plot had been copied many of times on film and TV but never can duplicated. Kim Stanley plays the strong controlling wife who does the seances and Richard Attenborough as her weak husband. If like the Others and Sixth Sense, you might like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lies bring forth the Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A deeply conventional moral emerges from a denaturalized plot involving a phony psychic, her meek husband, and a manipulative police superintendent. While Kim Stanley and Richard Attenborough acquit themselves spectacularly as the couple undone by overweening ambition of a childless wife, the film is indelibly marked by an all too brief final appearance of Patrick Magee, a stage actor seen to fair advantage on film only infrequently, and nearly always in supporting parts. Watch this favorite actor of Samuel Beckett, the originally intended performer of Krapp's Last Tape, in a performance of trenchant subtlety, enforcing Law through measured duplicity and chilling subterfuge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This little seen film stars one of America's greatest actresses in one of Britian's greatest thrillers. Kim Stanley was an excellent Method actress. I agree that she very much reminds me of Geraldine Page, another brilliant actress. The way she says her lines, or uses her hands and face is very much like Page. (Ironically, Page turned down this role!)I'm not going to get too much into the plot because I don't want to give too much away. If you want to know more about the plot, then check out some of the other comments. Let's just say great acting by the entire cast, and a good tense story, make for a night of suspense. So turn out the lights and enjoy!PS: If you're looking for a copy of this video don't forget to check your public library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very good film that dares to be different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I think Leonard Maltin was a little generous in giving this movie 4 stars (his highest rating), it was a very good and difficult to predict movie about two amateur kidnappers. It seems their motives are unusual in that they want to kidnap a girl so that one of them (the mrs.) can con everyone into believing she has psychic powers when she reveals both where the child and the money are hidden--or at least that's the plan. However, due to two personality factors (the hubby doesn't have the guts or inclination for crime and the wife is kind of nuts), their plans start to go awry.Excellent acting and scripting make this well worth your time and it's nice to see a movie with minimal budget and not exactly big name stars come off so well.FYI--since my original review, I have seen a Japanese remake, of sorts, called SEANCE. It's as good as SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON but is also different enough that I recommend you also try watching it as well. While very similar, it diverges into the supernatural and ends much differently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ghost story without a ghost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes this film work are the details. One scene I found particularly effective occurred at the beginning of the film. Myra is trying to explain to Billy why they must carry out this plan and turns off the music playing to make herself heard. A few seconds later she says, "Who turned off the music?" Billy replies, "You did, dear." Myra says, "Now, why would I have done that?" Billy resignedly says, "You're right. It must have been me." This brief scene effectively outlines the nature of their dysfunctional relationship.And while we cannot condone their behavior, we can sympathize with the characters. Ultimately, Billy loves his wife despite her self-centered and unhinged behavior. We understand his love for her because despite her actions, she is quite vulnerable.I've heard some stories and movies described as "ghost stories without a ghost". I never really understood what that meant until I heard "Seance" described this way. Both of the main characters are definitely "haunted"; Myra, by her childhood, the death of her son, and her own frustrated ambitions and Billy by the memories of a life without purpose. In fact, the only purpose in his life comes from his wife, Myra. That alone helps explain why he would go along with Myra's mad kidnapping scheme. It also helps build the suspense when Myra insists that they kill the child. Billy seems to like the child but we have plenty of examples of Billy going against his better judgment to carry out Myra's commands. Not until the very end do you know if he did or didn't do what Myra asked.This is an excellent, suspenseful movie with two superior performances. The characters of Myra and Billy Savage will stay with you long after the film ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drawing Room Drama (**NOTE - Contains Spoilers**)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The surname of our main characters, Myra and Bill, is "Savage." Although they are about as frightening as sloths bathing in the summer sun.The movie begins in a dark room, lit by one candle, a circle of people around a table, all eyes closed - Myra, talking - going into some emotional fervor. And that's it. The shades are pulled open. The candle blown out. Myra obviously eschews, bell boxes, spirit trumpets, and anything that might make a great show for her paying guests. I must admit, if I attended one of Myra's séances, I would have found it all dull, dreary, and uninspiring, like a wet afternoon.Hence her dilemma. She wants fame, fortune, and validity as a "true" seer. She needs to prove to the world that her psychic powers are legitimate.What follows is a drawn out exposition scene between Myra and Bill. Discussing plans. Establishing her very forgetful, pre-occupied character. She accuses Bill of turning off the record-player moments after Myra herself turned it off. He defends himself weakly. And caves in. "Oh yes," Bill remembers, "I must have turned it off myself."Myrna: "You know how weak you are. You know how much you need me." Bill just nods to this comment. Agreeing with her every delusion.It's the twisted relationship - a dramatic idea so popular in dramas from the Late 1950's - Mid 1960's. (Think "Sweet Smell of Success", "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?", And "Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?") Myra wears the pants in this marriage, and you know this is dangerous, when she is so clearly out of her mind. (And manipulated by an unseen presence named "Arthur.")She concocts this hare-brained "borrowing a child" scheme. The word "kidnapping" is taboo in the Savage household. The idea is that a prominent citizen's child goes missing (with Bill Savage's help) and Myra will offer her profoundly accurate psychic abilities to the bereaved parents - revealing the exact location of the child.What makes this film interesting, is Bill's non-devotion to this plan - his squeamishness about the "borrowing of a child" idea - and his constant consideration to back out of this nonsense at any moment.I must say, though, this film moves slowly enough, and Bill is real enough - that you can really empathize with this character - and by the time Bill is forced to pick up the ransom money - the whole experience becomes quite nerve-wracking. (This is the most believable money hand-off sequence I've ever seen - and it's done without any dialogue.)Tensions rise as Bill gets more edgy, and Myra begins demanding more than what Bill bargained for. And it's up to him to finally take a stand. This movie comes down to Myra and Bill's relationship. The whole kidnapping plot is a bit weak - and the séance scenes inspire no fear or awe. It's a twisted relationship film, with a British drawing room bent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seance on a Wet Afternoon is a great British suspense film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a British picture that I had long wanted to see so when I went to my local library and found this there, I quickly checked it out. Kim Stanley and Richard Attenborough are perfectly chilling as the séance wife Myra and reluctant kidnapper Billy. Judith Donner, in her only role, brings a subtle naturalness as the child Amanda who they "borrow" from a wealthy couple. Also good were Mark Eden and Nanette Newman, who's married to the film's director Bryan Forbes, as the child's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Clayton. John Barry's score brings various shades in many chase scenes and some quietly chilling ones involving Myra and Billy. And Forbes brings measured tension in many point-of-view shots. The suspense involves psychological emotions that cut to the bone and brings a compellingly British flavor to the concluding scenes. So for all that, I highly recommend Seance on a Wet Afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what British Cinema could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Saturday afternoon (not a wet one!) my mother happened to flick over from the sports on one channel to uncover an absolute gem of BRITISH Cinema from the 1960's. A little later I happened to come from my 'office', from where I run my home-based business, into the living room and was utterly transfixed by some of the greatest acting of all time in a British picture, together with a masterpiece of investigating the cinematic possibilities of the British city- and landscape. It's such a shame that the film wasn't a commercial success and that the independent production company behind it folded not long after the film's release. Both Mum and myself were amazed that we'd never even heard of Kim Stanley, who apparently was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in 'Seance...'. She should have been in more films than she was, but then again that was her choice to go more for theatrical work. I'd recommend this film to anybody and give it top rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Deeply Unnerving Film with Two Tremendous Lead Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kim Stanley delivers a tremendously affecting performance as a sad English suburban housewife who desperately wants to prove her validity as a medium and will go to criminal means to do so in this chilly and chilling drama.Critics heaped praise upon Stanley, always known as more of a stage actress than a movie actress, and the Academy awarded her a best actress nomination for her work in this film, and rightly so. At a time when movie acting could still be superficial, when Hollywood starlets were cast in ill-fitting roles because they looked better and would sell more tickets, Stanley gave a performance that distinguished itself in sheer commitment to character. It was rare then and still rare now to see a performance in which the actress creates a living, breathing human being before your very eyes.But in the interest of fairness, one must also mention the equally strong work of Richard Attenborough, who gets a less showy but as important role as Stanley's beleaguered husband, who will do anything to keep his wife happy, even after he begins to suspect that she may be ill. Attenborough creates the image of a middle-aged man who suspects that he was lucky to get the wife he has, and who wants more than anything to live a normal, family-oriented life that seems to always remain just beyond his grasp."Seance on a Wet Afternoon" is not a masterpiece, but it is a subtly and intensely disquieting film, the kind that lingers in your head long after you've seen it.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creepy in the extreme, SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON is a real spine-tingler. In a rare film appearance, Kim Stanley is brilliant as Myra Savage, a self proclaimed medium who, along with her milquetoast husband, kidnaps a child and then comes forward to prove she has the power to find her. Stanley gives a gutsy performance...her mannerisms, of which there are many, serve her very well. She's slightly off-center to begin with and director Bryan Forbes exploits that for maximum effect. Although she's an awful person, Stanley makes Myra pathetically sympathetic. Her performance is matched by Richard Attenborough as her nervous nelly of a husband. A great, thoughtful, and rare horror film that relies on character as opposed to blood and gore to scare the wits out of you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a child of the 60's, living in the grey north of england were every thing was worn at the edges or out of it's heyday, this film encapsulated the hold on to at any cost, claustrophobic era and exposed the tensions between the two class backgrounds of the two main protagonists. The tight camera work the use of B/W stock, the tight filming schedule all add to the paranoia and sense of suffocation at work in this truly scary masterpiece.The female lead's sense of injustice at what was, what should have been, and what was due mimics the slow lumbering death taking place in the British Empire. The male lead's almost simpering appeasement to his wife only serves to convey the feeling of petrification that was present in British society.by focusing the attention to a tiny room on a wet dreadfully English afternoon, with all players attentions being drawn inwards to this rotten over-ripe centre, one can apply the metaphor to British society, after all the empire was nothing more than smoke and mirrors, like the roman empire, fear was the key.The fear of emptiness, of loneliness,of loss , the sense of those feelings are sumptuously portrayed. The trick for younger audiences is to understand British life and society was very different in the B/W days</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable 1964 Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Highly talented actress Kim Stanley in one of her unfortunately few screen appearances plays Myra, a very emotional and unstable woman, who feels she has supernatural powers in contacting the dead and missing as a medium in order to get a grip on reality that she seems to have lost contact with in this both haunting and tragic British 1964 import about madness and possession.The movie "Seance on a Wet Afternoon" starts off somewhat slow as we in the audience are slowly pulled into what is really going on between Myra and her husband Billy, Richard Attenborough, with them both talking in some kind of code or type of in-language that only they understand. For the first half hour of the movie you have no idea what's happening between them. Later it becomes very clear that Marya has crossed the line between sanity and insanity but her poor husband Billy has no choice but to go along with her because. Billy loves her and doesn't want Myra to end up being committed to a mental institution. It's later Billy's love for Myra in playing along with her in her deadly games turned out to be far far worse the he ever could have imagined. Myra not only losing her son Arthur at childbirth but not even being allowed to see him by the doctor in order not to traumatize her any more then she already was had Myra over the years, with Billy going along, create a fantasy world with Arthur being alive and growing up and living together with her and her husband Billy. Myra even has a room in her house where Arthur lives in as a little boy. Myra claims that she was told by Arthur that she has the "gift" of being a medium and wants to prove it to the world by concocting a plan for Billy to kidnap someone and have her find the person with her "gift of medium ship". Billy somehow goes along with Myra's insane plan by kidnapping little Amanda Clayton, Judith Donner, from school. Later Myra goes to the little girls parents Mr. &amp; Mrs. Clayton, Mark Eden &amp; Nenette Newman, and tells them that she had a dream where little Amanda told her thing that only they would know not knowing that Myra got that information from Amanda herself who is locked up in her house. The mother of little Amanda is so impressed by Myra that she agrees to go to her house and attend a séance for finding Amanda. At the same time Myra and Billy blackmail the Clayton's for a ransom for Amanda's return. Billy skillfully gets the money away from Mr. Clayton on the London Metro even though the police set up an elaborate plan to catch him. It's later that Something happens to derail both Myra and Billy's plans when Amanda falls sick with a very high fever and both of them know that they can't call for a doctor or get Amanda to the hospital for help without being caught and arrested by the police. Meanwhile the séance for the little girl with her mother Mrs. Clayton present goes on and Myra hints that little Amanda has passed away knowing that she's very sick and near death upstairs in the house where the séance is being held. Later when Amanda dies Billy finally realizes that it was Myra's plan all along to have Amanda die and join Arthur as a playmate in her fantasy world that she created for him. With his conscious getting the best of him Billy calls the police who have Myra arrested and committed and himself also arrested for kidnapping as well as the death of little Amanda; but not after Myra gives them her last and final séance on a wet afternoon that left poor Myra completely insane. Tremendous and unforgettable film about madness and obsession that's done with both honesty and intelligence and avoids the usual pitfalls of sensationalism that most movies about that subject usually do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific piece of suspenseful film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bit of a lost classic that slipped between the cracks despite the Oscar nomination for lead actress Kim Stanley, this story of kidnapping and madness in the Savage household starts off with a first hour so expertly paced, nuanced and beautifully photographed that you begin to think the 8.4 score it has on IMDb isn't a stretch at all. The way Forbes handles the exposition, withhelding information from the audience long enough to keep them guessing, releasing them in an ambiguous fashion to maintain an aura of mystery, all the while not forgetting those little casual moments that don't advance the plot but allow the material to breathe and the characters to emerge thridimensional and human instead of drab caricatures drawn as plot devices, is a masterclass in storytelling that one would expect from a master of Bergman's calibre. The second half steadily accelerates, building up tension between the kidnappers and between them and the police, with some absolutely riveting pieces of suspense such as the cat and mouse game in the subway or the mother of the kidnapped girl making a sudden appearance at the house her daughter is being held to participate in a seance where the medium foreshadows her daughter's fate while she remains unaware, right down to the brilliant conclusion around a seance table where stage actor Patrick Magee has a cameo (Mr. Alexander from a CLOCKWORK ORANGE), Seance is a terrific piece of film-making that will particularly appeal to horror fans. Kim Stanley deserved that Oscar and so did Richard Attenborough (who would go on to sweep the Oscars with GANDHI), both of whom give electrifying performances as husband and wife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of this, only it was directed by Bryan Forbes. Wonderful shots in London in 1962 (not 64 as stated). No violence, yet there is an underlying threat throughout. The creepy Victorian house adds atmosphere but it is the location shots that are excellent. Attenborough is convincing but it is Kim Stanley who shines, quite apart from disguising her American accent, she is absolutely faultless. Forbes' interview on the DVD is fascinating. As he states there is not a cardboard film set in sight; it is all on location. The interview adds so much and should be viewed after the film as he answers all the questions you are asking while watching. John Barry's score is also excellent; especially the use of violins in the scene in the Rolls Royce. A 60s black and white classic. that deserves to be reappraised in coming years and will stand as one of Forbes' greatest moments as a director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singular film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie many years ago - before the age of VHS - by accident on a public broadcast station. I was so impressed that I committed the title to memory. After three decades, I now have the DVD. It's as impressive now as it was when I first saw it. What's so great, you ask? For starters, superb acting, atmospheric cinematography, and tight direction. Add in a beautiful old Victorian house as a main setting, along with a perfect soundtrack (I particularly like the use of Mendelsohn's "Hear My Prayer"), and you've got a a singularly excellent film. Highly recommended, even if you normally dislike slower-paced films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the tragedy of a frustrated spiritualist couple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very interesting dive into the world of spiritualism with an almost devastating charting of the psychology of a disturbed medium. Kim Stanley's performance as Myra, using the spirit of her stillborn child as a link with the other side, is almost ghoulish, being totally blind to reality and having lost all touch with her own humanity. A drama of great suspense, especially as she insists on a séance when the mother of the child they have kidnapped appears, the child being sick in the next room, it's almost unbearably uncomfortable but extremely interesting and fascinating. Bryan Forbes, born today in 1926, died last year, made a number of very diverse and tricky films, sometimes experimental, but always intelligent. This was one of his best, certainly a suspense thriller dealing with the out of the ordinary... One of the last great noir films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Myra Savage is a struggling psychic, who along with her weak-willed husband, Billy, kidnap the young daughter of wealthy parents. The plan is to extort money from the fretting parents and then for Myra to help the parents find the child with her psychic ability, thus improving her standing in the psychic field. But as the story unfolds, Myra grows ever more close to the edge of insanity, could the still born death of the Savage's own child be the critical issue?Seance On A Wet Afternoon is something of a hidden/forgotten British treasure, not only because of its eerie atmospherics, but also because it contains a quite incredible acting performance from Kim Stanley as the troubled Myra Savage. Stanley was nominated for an Academy Award but lost out to Julie Andrews for Mary Poppins, I wonder just how many people even remember Stanley's film? Tho chiefly marketed as a crime picture, this piece actually feels more like an offshoot of the horror genre, it's a genuinely creepy picture that has unease lurking in every marvellous black and white corner. Boosted by an excellently understated turn from Richard Attenborough (also producer here) as Billy Savage, directed with exceptional skill from Bryan Forbes (Whistle Down the Wind), and with a plinking creepy score from maestro John Barry, this adaptation of Mark McShane's novel comes highly recommended for those that like a great psychological character study. Oh and of course for those that know brilliant acting when they see it! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repressing and claustrophobic movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very claustrophobic and repressive dark drama that has almost gone un-noticed by the critics since it was made in 1964.This is the sad and tragic story of a very sick woman (Kim Stanley) whose never recovered after giving birth to a dead baby. More tragic still; her husband (played by Richard Attenborough) is so in love with her still, it becomes a pitiful and sensitive script - despite the horrors of child kidnapping. One scene in particular towards the end will move anyone to tears as the couple exchange their words of love for each other when it would appear that all is lost for them both - and in particular, Stanley's character vowing to do everything for the love of her husband, but only after he's committed the worst of crimes - and all in the name of love for her... Richard Attenborough's character is often regarded as weak, but is merely a victim of being strong in love. Think about that one when you're reaching for the tissues! I suspect the only other actress that could have competed for the lead performance was Geraldine Page, who uncannily, is not unlike Stanley - both in features and acting style. This is a tough movie for all its cast, and features some of the big names of its day, including Mark Eden, (whose handsome good looks will make the ladies swoon) and a very beautiful Nanette Newman as the unfortunate parents of the missing child.This title has been very slow in coming out in the UK - indeed it was only ever released on video in the US.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Séance on a Wet Afternoon is more drama than horror, but it works as an excellent morality tale. In fact, I would say the film is positively anti-horror as it takes one of horror's genre staples (the supernatural) and then sets out to disprove with the plot, which involves a medium having her husband kidnap a young girl. The main draws of this film are not the set pieces or even the plot itself, but rather the central characters; both of which are brought to life via excellent performances from Kim Stanley and Richard Attenborough. The focal point of the film is Kim Stanley's imbalance and lust for fame, and so she hatches a plot to gain celebrity by having her submissive husband kidnap a young girl, only for her to use her "psychic powers" to help the police to find the girl. However, things become darker when the plan starts to unravel and the more the wife talks to her "otherworldly contact" (the couple's dead son), the more the husband starts to suspect that his wife may not want the girl found alive.Most of the burden of the film falls onto the two central actors, and both perform brilliantly. Kim Stanley fares well as her character goes through a range of emotions and always looks and feels the part as the delusional medium. The main acting plaudits go to Richard Attenborough for my money, however. It's clear that Kim Stanley is the film's central focus, but Attenborough manages to lead the film from the back and it is through his performance that his character's actions seem more plausible. The film moves at a slow pace for most of the duration, and it has to be said that there isn't a lot of excitement. However, director Bryan Forbes does an excellent job of sucking the audience in and making them wonder what is going to happen next thanks to his wonderful portrayal of the story. It's not too difficult to see where the film is going, but the climatic sequence is well done and gives balance to the story. Overall, while I wouldn't consider Séance on a Wet Afternoon to be a horror movie; it's still an excellent film and I can certainly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seance on a Wet Afternoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chilling masterpiece from Bryan Forbes about a supposed medium, Myra, whose hold on her husband Bill is so tightly gripped he's willing to kidnap a wealthy man's child to prove her gift legit. It's quite evident Myra is deeply wounded and a bit off-her-rocker, but Bill's love for her is so entrenched he'll sacrifice everything to do as she commands."You miss all the good things in life just because you won't reach that bit further to touch the truth." This is what she truly believes especially when Billy wishes to put an end to this fiasco, but Myra's undying devotion to her cause for making people believe her "gift" is definitively real.The true key to the entire film is Arthur..a child that died at childbirth which is the true ingredient behind Myra's descent into quiet madness. We must not forget that, despite early success in the whole strategy put in place by her, the mastermind is quite disturbed.Evocatively photographed and stunningly acted(Attenborough is especially outstanding as Billy, a man who so wishes to stop this from going further, but whose deep devotion to the woman he so cherishes is willing to carry it out all the way), you are instantly pulled into the plot and how this seemingly perfect plan will inevitably fall apart.Last but not least is Kim Stanley as Myra, the main character of the picture whose vacant eyes display cold reserve as if she really doesn't quite have control of what she is doing and saying. The person she once was isn't here, but somewhere in a morass of guilt and sorrow..the longing for her Arthur is always out in the open painfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to know where to start when discussing this curious and intriguing film because there are so many amazing parts to it that it is simply outstanding overall. Every shot is set up with precision and care, providing a magnificent visual feel in terms of camera angles, lighting effects and spacing. The continuity editing, which is combined with some excellent, fitting sound effects editing, creates a number of amazing sequences, the best of these being the car/kidnapping and chloroform scenes. The gliding camera-work is simply amazing, the music choices fit the action perfectly, and Richard Attenborough is also great in his BAFTA awarding-winning role. Kim Stanley tends to be a bit overbearing, and the film does not work half as well as a character study as it does as a gripping thriller. However as a simple thriller it is the best directed one that I have ever come across, with the only major problem being the final few scenes, which are a bit of a drag, not quite fitting in with what has gone before. Still, 95% of this is a stunning thriller that delivers an impressive amount on both a visual and audio level. It has to be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A seance leader (Kim Stanley) convinces her husband (Richard Attenborough) to kidnap the daughter (Judith Donner) of a wealthy family. Stanley's goal is to "borrow" the daughter in order to use her as a means of gaining fame as a "medium" by convincing everyone that she would have found the daughter through her superior psychic abilities. Needless to say, it doesn't quite work out. The movie's plot is excellent and the director, composer, and cinematographer, not to mention the art director and the film editor, more than achieve cinematic nirvana in bringing it to the screen. The highest marks would go to the two main actors, Attenborough and Stanley, who portray both their relationship and themselves within it as if they themselves were these characters. Stanley's character is the dominant one in the relationship, but her plan to kidnap the girl illustrates her dangerous instability. Attenborough's character may be even worse off for its pathetic submission to the insults and bizarre logic of his wife, acts of which the film captures throughout, to its inevitable end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut and Engrossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this film is a bit baffling. Two séances play an important part in the plot, but neither takes place on a wet afternoon. One takes place in the evening, the other on an obviously fine day. Perhaps its significance is clearer in the original novel, which I have never read.Billy and Myra Savage, a middle-aged, middle-class suburban couple, kidnap Amanda, the young daughter of a wealthy businessman. Although they send her father a ransom note, their motive is not financial. Even though Billy is unable to work because of ill health, they live in a large, imposing Victorian house and are clearly not short of money. Rather Myra, a medium who holds séances in her home, believes that she can become famous for her supposed psychic abilities by helping the police to solve the crime.When I first saw this film many years ago I disliked it for what I saw as a lack of realism. How on earth did Billy and Myra imagine that they were going to get away with a plan so obviously badly conceived and badly executed? Looking back, I can see that my criticism was unfair and that I had been unduly influenced by films in which a gang of master- criminals put together an intricate, seemingly foolproof, scheme only to come unstuck because of some minor detail, of the tenacity or brilliance of the investigating detective, or of sheer bad luck. Because the truth is that Billy and Myra are not brilliant master- criminals. Far from it. She is mentally unstable and detached from reality to the extent that she hardly realises that she is committing a crime. She insists that she is merely "borrowing" Amanda, not kidnapping her. She believes that she is in touch with the spirit of her son Arthur, who died at birth, but fails to realise that she does not actually have any psychic abilities. If she did, she would not have to go through such a ridiculous charade in order to "demonstrate" them. As for her husband, he is merely a weak and cowardly little man unable to stand up to his domineering wife, although at the end he does display a greater humanity than she is capable of.This is the only film in which I have ever seen Kim Stanley. She was, apparently, a theatre and television actress who had only appeared in one previous feature film, "The Goddess", and was only the third choice for the role of Myra, Deborah Kerr and Simone Signoret having turned it down. Yet she is excellent here, showing us the way in which her self- deluded character's personality disintegrates bit by bit to the point where she can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality and can see no objection to killing Amanda. Richard Attenborough, the film's co- producer and her co-star, paid tribute to her "complexity of dramatic impression". She received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (losing to Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins) but this did not persuade her to make a career in films. It was to be another eighteen years before she appeared in another film, "Frances". (She was Oscar nominated for that as well). Attenborough is also very good as the cowed Billy.This was the third film directed by Bryan Forbes, who had made such a brilliant start to his directing career with "Whistle Down the Wind", one of the great classics of the British cinema; his wife Nanette Newman appears as Amanda's mother. Like Forbes's two earlier films (his second was "The L-Shaped Room"), this one is in black-and-white, something still regularly used in Britain (unlike America) during the mid-sixties, probably because colour television had not yet come to Britain. I was reminded of some of the early works of Alfred Hitchcock, especially "Shadow of a Doubt", another psychological thriller about a young girl in danger and which takes place in a seemingly tranquil suburb. "Séance on a Wet Afternoon" doesn't have quite the same emotional impact as something like "Whistle Down the Wind", largely because the two leading characters are so unsympathetic. It is, however, a taut and engrossing psychological drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not sure if I would like this movie, so I was very pleasantly surprised to find that I not only liked it, I loved it! The plot about a psychic seeking recognition by involving her husband in a kidnapping plot might seem trivial, but there was nothing trivial about the great acting by Kim Stanley and Richard Attenborough. They worked well together! What I really liked about Richard Attenborough's performance was that he did not say much(except for one scene), but he held my attention just the same with his marvelous facial expressions. In my opinion, an actor who does not say much, but still can gain your attention is an excellent actor, and that is Richard Attenborough!

Andrews created the part on Broadway. When the movie was cast, the producers chose Audrey Hepburn, for name recognition. Many in Hollywood industry and the Academy were not thrilled over the slight and thought that was a major mistake, therefore giving Andrews the Oscar for Mary Poppins, no matter who else was nominated and their performance.

		<fullReview>Two magnificent actors, Kim Stanley and Richard Attenborough star in "Seance on a Wet Afternoon," a 1964 film directed by Brian Forbes. Stanley was one of the truly great stage and film actresses of the last century; unfortunately, her film performances are very rare.Here Stanley plays Myra Savage, a woman who probably believes that she is a true psychic and communicating with her late son. Her late son tells her that in order to gain a big reputation, she needs to kidnap the child of a wealthy family, collect the ransom, and then psychically come up with the location of the child and the money.Myra doesn't do much - instead, she sends her weak, cowed husband Billy (Attenborough) to do the kidnapping. They make one room in the house look like a hospital room and, wearing surgical masks, they tell the child she's sick and in hospital. The whole thing starts to make Billy extremely nervous, as he realizes that his delusional wife, whom he's been jollying along all these years, is in fact nuts.Brilliant performances by Stanley and Attenborough, Stanley capturing the manipulative nature of Myra as well as her delusions, and Attenborough simply amazing as a weak-willed milksop who seems willing to do anything to avoid a confrontation with Myra.Though this is a somewhat slow film but extremely atmospheric and suspenseful. This is not only due to Forbes' direction, but is also driven in part by Stanley's portrayal of the unstable Myra. You never know what she's going to do next, but you can guess - and it scares you.Excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films of the 1960s. The black-and-white widescreen format induces nostalgia in those of us who were movie-going at that time. The plot: a woman who believes herself to be a 'psychic' (superb performance by Kim Stanley) talks her downtrodden husband (great performance by Richard Attenborough) into kidnapping a schoolgirl so she can reveal her powers to the world by 'finding' the girl. The atmosphere of the film is creepy and the music by John Barry seems slightly at odds with it at times, but this is a minor quibble; 'Seance' is a fine piece of work. As far as British DVD releases are concerned, the Network 2006 edition has good picture quality but lousy sound (the dialogue is far too quiet and the music and effects are too loud). The Carlton 2004 edition had better sound plus optional subtitles in English for hard of hearing, but the picture is grainier and not as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forbes also wrote this one (as he often did). It's hard to find any fault with this movie. You can't get much better than a film, not only written and directed by Forbes, but starring an unforgettable pairing in Kim Stanley and Richard Attenborough. Ms. Stanley didn't make too many movies, but this one is enough to show why she's often thought of as the best stage actress of the 20th century.Just to tell a small bit of the story, it's about a woman and her husband who earn some money giving séances for people. It's unclear whether the husband, played by Attenborough, actually believes anything supernatural is going on, because as the story progresses, what does become clear is that his wife, played by Stanley, is having, or has already had, a serious break with reality.A word of warning to those thinking this is a movie about the supernatural given the film's title?it is not, although some may see something of the supernatural in the wife's delusional mode of existence. The film is actually about something entirely different?the kidnapping of a young girl. Very suspensefully done from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is some discussion on the message boards as to whether the girl was killed or not.I want to believe that the girl was left alive by Billy. He did seem to indicate to the police in the séance that she was alright. And if she was dead, why would he go to so much trouble to place the girl wrapped warmly in a blanket where the scouts could find her? Would he not have just buried her in a shallow grave during the dead of night? That is what is great about the ending though. It wouldn't take much of a leap to think that Billy had gone through with the killing and had, as a result, lost all touch with reality and was in denial of what he had done, thus treating her as though she was still alive. In the final scene before the police arrived, Myra certainly looked and acted as though the killing had happened.Endings like this is what makes for a great movie that will be discussed forever. I guess that I just really want to believe that Billy came to his senses before it was too late. Great acting by the two leads and the rest of the cast as well!</fullReview>

When she evolves a plan to publicise her "gift" by kidnapping a child for ransom then miraculously divining its whereabouts to an eager world he goes along with it simply to placate her.More by luck than judgement they muddle through until the child becomes seriously ill.......... There are three remarkable performances in this movie.Miss Kim Stanley gives it large as Myra the medium.My goodness me doesn't she act.You can almost see Lee Strasburg standing at her shoulder egging her on. In complete contrast Mr Richard Attenborough is almost an anti-actor. Not always known for his restraint,Mr Attenborough glides silently through the picture with a small grimace here,a nod there,an anguished glance every so often,in the manner of a man who knows he is sure to be hanged quite shortly .And then there's Mr Patrick McGee,surely one of the most menacing of British actors.As the senior detective he is a man who knows only too well human weakness and duplicity.He is cunning,cruel even,but ultimately compassionate as Myra descends into madness before his eyes during her final seance.He is the very epitome of controlled violence,strength and anger contained within his smart overcoat. Much of the credit for this movie must go to Mr Bryan Forbes,director,writer,producer and actor par excellence in British cinema since the early 1950s.He can make "issue" pictures without making an issue of it - if that isn't too contradictory.His masterpiece may well have been the near-contemporary "The L - shaped Room" which earned Miss Leslie Caron an Oscar nomination,but in "Seance on a wet afternoon" he prevents the theatrical Miss Stanley from completely going over the top and coaxes a quiet and subtle performance from his friend Mr Richard Attenborough that he has never bettered. The minutiae of the picture may work better than the whole but it is still a fine example of the output of the British Studios at what has - with hindsight - become recognised as the height of their powers.</fullReview>

But you know instantly that the woman is dangerously unstable and things can only go from very bad to much worse. Both Stanley, (much underused, at least so far as the cinema was concerned), and Attenborough give terrific performances and Forbes handles the unsettling material, (from a novel by Mark McShane), with considerable brio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a brilliant how-catch-'em told as a character study of a middle-aged couple, Billy and Myra, that decides to kidnap a child in order to fix everything that has gone wrong with their lives. As it evolves, the crime itself seems to bounce back and forth between lucky improvisation and clever planning. In terms of suspense, the best scenes are the kidnapping itself and the ransom pick-up. The movie seems to be saying that things are more apt to go according to plan when dealing with adults rather than children. Poor Billy has to do most of the dirty work. Myra masterminds the crime, but she is clearly an unstable person from the outset. At one point, Billy complains to Myra that he is not "a master criminal" implying that that is what their crime needs, and he is right about that. It needs two master criminals, and neither of them is up to it, but they give it their best.Despite all of that, you have people doing horrible things with a surprising hold on their humanity. There is genuine tenderness on the part of Billy throughout and even from the police inspector at the end.There is a revealing power shift in the course of the movie as the submissive Billy gradually reveals that he holds the marriage together and actually does have more talent as a master criminal than she does. Myra and Billy are both motivated by pain and loss, but she can't stand it while he has long since accepted it.The cinematography is tops, with judicious, almost invisible use of zoom lenses, clear-eyed views of London in the early 1960s, and moody, sinister looks at the kidnappers house, cluttered with the refuse of the couple's bad memories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it's top calibre acting you want then this is where you'll find it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If what you are looking for in a movie is to see an acting masterclass then you need look no further than Séance on a Wet Afternoon. This psychological drama is very much a character-driven piece and it features a pair of truly outstanding performances at its centre. It tells the story of a medium that has lost sight of reality since the death of her child. She convinces her weak-willed, overly dependent husband to kidnap a young girl from a wealthy family in order to collect a sizable ransom and from which she can then subsequently use her 'powers' to assist the parents in finding the child, leading to her attaining fame as one with a gift of the second sight.The two lead actors here are Kim Stanley and Richard Attenborough. Stanley only appeared in seven feature films, meaning that she is far from a household name but she was quite obviously an actress with incredible talent. Seemingly an advocate of method acting, she is unbelievable as the unbalanced complex woman at the centre of the plot. It's a pretty intense role but it's played to perfection without resorting to anything over-the-top. Richard Attenborough is practically just as impressive as her husband in an understated performance of a character with many flaws and contradictions. His presence is key to the film's success in that he has feet in both camps, in that he acts with his wife in carrying out their crime, yet he is the one who has moral doubts and so is the audience identification figure. It takes some considerable skill on Attenborough's part in order to create a character which is so believable ? sympathetic yet quite reprehensible. Both actors work beautifully together and create something very real. The film also offers very good turns from Patrick Magee as a wily police inspector and Nanette Newman as the broken mother of the missing girl.John Barry is on hand too with a moody score which perfectly complements the moody black and white photography. It all adds up to a film with considerable depth. Despite the subject matter, it isn't really a thriller; it's more of a psychological drama. It doesn't play out in a very predictable manner either which is never a bad thing. This British film still remains relatively unknown, which strikes me as a bit of a shame. I guess it's one that will remain under the radar but which will reward those who seek it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two powerful performances in a vintage oldie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Ms. Myra Savage (Stanley) self-professes that she is a professional medium, it does make me chuckle is there any definitive method to determine the word "professional" in this line of business in this cynical world? But Myra's believes her gift, but paradoxically in order to establish her reputation, she hatches a scheme of kidnapping a rich kid Amanda (Donner), and so she can her "gift" to correctly predict the whereabout of the kid and the ransom, to stage a sensation for her benefit.But it is a risky plan, as the parents of Amanda doesn't know Myra, she must pro-actively visit them and lure their attention, which will inconveniently raise the suspicion from the police (which is a sure thing after the kidnap has occurred), so a further police investigation is inevitable. Also it is an implausible plan, one may wonder even if she pulls off the subterfuge, how she can sustain her reputation after that? Keep rigging everything in advance? I fail to foresee what this one-time deal can really boost her career? As it is under one condition, she is a sham. But is she?Also kidnapping requires field work, so she must manipulate her weak-minded husband Billy (Attenborough) to carry out more physically-taxing procedures, including kidnapping, receiving ransom and transferring the hostage. This vintage black-and-white drama from Bryan Forbes hinges heavily on the play-off between Stanley and Attenborough, both are superb and tellingly affecting, although we can never morally take their stand, the scenes of their interactions register a sublime psychological mind-game of control and defence between a married couple. Stanley is righteously honoured with an Oscar nomination, Myra is shown simultaneously as a perpetrator with cold-hearted conviction and a victim of her own delusional obsession of their stillborn baby. Her so-called gift is the only connection (whether imaginary or uncannily tangible) to him which she clings to devotedly. A tour-de- force from Ms. Stanley, whose screen roles are rather scarce and here, it is a performance of a lifetime, she is resolute, calm, crafty and projects her towering presence with pitch- perfect note, until the ending, that ending which powerfully strengths the emotional impact by giving Stanley a show-stopping vent of truth and also masterfully veils the fact whether it is a guilt-driven confession or in a more eerie interpretation, she really reconnects with her dead child and gains her gift but at the same time, beans also been spilled so that she can never get away with her crime, simply brilliant! Attenborough, with a fake nose (which seems to be an odd option), didn't get enough credits for his equally excellent performance, he is the one audience is rooting for, his has doubt in their scheme from the very first, and he is compliant but we know when things reach the threshold, he is the game-changer can alter the entire plan, because he is not a psychopath, Attenborough instills great credibility into Billy, equips him with a humane touch which subtly subverts Myra's indefatigable madness. In cliques mainly composed with male chauvinists, we can see how easily his poignant acting can be easily snubbed. The truth is, occasionally the film's one-dimensional and predictable storyline tends to be a shade bland, and the procedural account of getting the random is too archaic to believe (a deliberate mockery of the police force?); but the performances are gravitating enough to ensnare viewers into a compelling human tragedy with its expressive chiaroscuro, a must- see for everyone.</fullReview>

The Mood is Persistently Bleak whether in the Gloomy Mansion or in the Underground with an Intense Money Exchange. Sometimes Subtly Expressionistic and Occasionally Nerve Racking the Movie Manages to Make the Tale of an Unhinged Psychic and Her Subservient Husband Kidnapping a Little Girl for Ransom with Twists and Turns that Keep the Viewer Attached to the Wild Story.It's an Uneasy, Uncomfortable Film that Delivers Many Outstanding Movie-Making Flourishes in an Understated Uformity and Keeps Things at a Lively Pace with One Foot in the Afterlife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>absolute brilliant film!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this film is a masterpiece based around 'Myra' and her long suffering husband 'billy'.'kim Stanley' plays Myra so convincingly that one cannot help feeling great sympathy for her.the director 'bryan Forbes' does a first class job from start to finish and the music by john Barry fits perfectly as the film progresses.i actually watched this film earlier this afternoon and enjoyed it immensely.Richard attenborough plays husband 'billy' in his own unique way and again one cannot fail to feel sorry for him as he carries out his unstable wife's plans.the film also captures everyday life in the west end of London in the early 1960s. for example the scene on the train shows passengers smoking'something which is illegal now due to the tragic kings cross fire in 1985 caused by a combination of litter which had accumulated after some time, and presumably a dropped cigarette which hadn't been put out properly.the end scene of the film is particularly moving as 'Myra'unwittingly confesses her guilt in the presence of two policemen whilst she is holding her séance. and poor billy is seen slowly accepting that the game is up before disclosing to the police where he hid the ransom money. truly one of the most moving films ever made in Britain in the 60s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this I thought it was dull. Now it doesn't seem dull so much as a little sluggish. If the plot is described in print, it sounds like a lively suspense film -- the professional medium Kim Stanley and her reluctant husband Richard Attenborough decide to kidnap the little daughter of a rich family and collect a big ransom before returning her. As lagnappe, Stanley will even volunteer her services as a clairvoyant to "help" the family get the girl back. Every move has been thoroughly planned by Stanley.But -- the best-laid schemes of mice and men and Stanley and Attenborough and me gang aft agley. During one of her professional afternoon séances, with the kidnapped girl ensconced in the next room with Attenborough, Stanley faints. Attenborough rushes to her side. The guests leave, but in his haste Attenborough has forgotten to lock the door to the little girl's room and she appears at the top of the staircase, seeing Stanley's and Attenborough's faces for the first time in all their unmasked glory. You can see why she has to die.The coppers have been nosing around, full of suspicion, as soon as Stanley volunteered to help them by providing some accurate observations about the kidnapped victim, such as the name of her favorite toy. Now they show up in earnest, persuade Stanley to conduct another séance, and, in a state, she spills all the beans.These altered states of consciousness are interesting phenomena, both from a psychological and a sociological perspective. They're real enough. They take all kinds of different forms with different names -- spirit possession, voodoo, speaking in tongues, confusional awakening state, hypnosis, multiple personality, fugue. Nobody has a clear idea of what causes them or how to avoid them.Anyway, okay, this time around I got the general idea that kidnapping the little girl was a means of providing a temporary substitute for the couple's stillborn baby, Arthur. It's not an unintelligent script. But, if the symbolic status of the victim weren't spelled out in the dialog, you'd have a hard time figuring it out because neither Stanley nor her tag-along husband treat the girl with any tenderness or concern, except when it's in aid of their own interest to do so.Attenborough is in his mousy persona here, an interesting actor if a somewhat clumsy director. Kim Stanley I understand had a highly respectable career on the stage. She only made a few movies and, for whatever reason, didn't make much of an impression in any of them, including this one. As was the case with Helen Hayes, another stage star, something didn't go click as the cameras rolled. Nanette Newman is the beautiful, vacuous mother of the little girl. Patrick Magee is super-duper as the Chief Inspector. He's always good. Catch him drooling and going berserk in "A Clockwork Orange."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A psychotic psychic and her meek husband kidnap the daughter of a wealthy family in an elaborate plan to generate publicity for her séance business. Stanley creates an interesting character, but her background as a stage actress is evident in fits of over-emoting. Attenborough is likable as her weak-willed husband. The small roles are well acted. The film takes too long establishing the relationship between Stanley and Attenborough. Forbes creates a creepy atmosphere in the old mansion in which the couple resides, but is letdown by an uneven script. Some of the plot elements are highly implausible and the conclusion is rather abrupt and unsatisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly this tepid exercise made me yearn for the good old days of the American studios. Warner Bros. might have cast Joan Crawford in the wacky lead with Arthur Kennedy as her slavish husband and maybe the florid John Brahm in charge of background mood and stage direction. That way, we would have at least gotten a briskly edited, atmospheric crime drama with an actress no one ever confused with high art. What this British production comes up with instead is a drearily slow, bloodless psycho-drama where we're all expected to stand in awe of the great stage actress Kim Stanley. Never mind that she over-emotes in her own carefully under-stated way, or that Forbes films the proceedings as if he's on auto-pilot with the script (also his).Yes, I know this kind of leveling is supposed to bring out the nuances of character that might otherwise be overwhelmed by melodrama. But who can sympathize with the terminally dour Attenborough who hangdogs throughout the entire production. Or with Stanley, who plays so ardently and sweetly against type, that we can just about see the wheels turning. Indeed, bringing Attenborough to justice is more like an act of mercy than of B-movie tragedy, while Stanley's addled medium evokes all the sympathy of a spoiled, arrogant child. Somebody should have reminded Forbes about the old Greek advisory that the extreme lies not only in offering too much but also in offering too little. That way, he might have given this anemic exercise a badly needed transfusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating (a wildly dissenting view)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frustrating. There are so many exceptional pieces of this film, but there are probably even more pieces that are rather infuriating. The story concerns a neurotic woman who swears she is a medium (Kim Stanley - giving one of the most mannered performances in cinema history). To prove this she devises a plot to kidnap the young daughter of a rich man and then lead the police to her. Her testes-less husband (Richard Attenborough) goes along with her plan. After the first couple of minutes of their interaction, we know how sorry he feels for his wife. He doesn't believe any of what she says, but he'll obviously do anything she asks. The kidnapping plot is truly terrible, though. Neither the original author of the novel, Mark McShane, nor the director/screenwriter, Forbes, knew anything about either committing crimes or police procedures. Either that or everyone in Britain is retarded. Attenborough accomplishes this kidnapping by approaching the child's driver and telling him that the school's headmistress has a note for him. When the driver walks away (with the kid and the keys still in the car), Attenborough jumps in and drives away. Okay, don't you think that when the driver finds that there is no note with the headmistress he's going to run back to the car and find it gone, which would then lead to a massive hunt for the vehicle and the man who lied about the note, whom the driver saw very, very clearly? This crime should have been solved by the next evening. Oh, and don't forget Kim Stanley's trip to the rich man's house, when she tells him that she dreamed about their daughter, who told her the name of her best friend and her favorite stuffed animal. The rich man says, "Oh, you could have heard that anywhere!" Hmm, really? I would think that that would raise a certain amount of suspicion, more than it does anyway (the police visit her house but simply leave when they find them not home, and do not leave anyone to stake out the place).The there's this stupid backstory about the kidnappers' dead son (they try to hide that fact but it's obvious from the first two seconds of the film). The way hints are dropped it comes as no surprise to any thinking audience that there's something even more special about this kid. When that point is finally revealed, it's just silly. Two years later the film Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? would be much more successful with a similar subplot.It's all so disappointing, because the film is very well directed. Very beautifully so. And Attenborough, despite desperately needing to grow a pair of cojones, is exceptional. Also great is the music, by John Barry. But, damn, so much of the film blows. So little of this story is believable, and it's just so frustrating. That frustration turned into total annoyance by the end of the film. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If The Spirit Moves You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The DVD release has an 'extra' in the shape of Bryan Forbes talking about the film in the course of which he takes full credit for 'inventing' the child that died at birth - a revelation withheld until the closing stages; until then Kim Stanley has given the impression that it lived for some years. This raises the interesting speculation that Edward Albee 'stole' this from Forbes for his own highly successful play (which has been revived consistently, unlike Seance) Who's Afraid Of Viginia Woolf, in which, again, a dead male child is referred to throughout the three acts by 'parents' George and Martha until George (again it is the husband that forces the wife to accept the truth) reveals that the child never in fact existed and was a fantasy. Virginia Woolf opened on Broadway in October, 1962, and played in London at the Piccadilly Theatre the following year whilst Seance was released in 1964. In a line from the screenplay the leading lady says '... brightness falls from the air ...'. In 1941 Nigel Balchin published a very fine novel set during the Blitz and entitled Darkness Falls From The Air. Bryan Forbes owned a bookshop for many years in Virginia Water. As for the film itself, seen in 2008, it's fairly ho hum though doubtless finding its audience at the time, never one to be afraid of nepotism Forbes again cast his wife, Nanette Newman, and Richard Attenborough's brother-in-law, Gerald Sim, in supporting roles. Kim Stanley has the flashier role and acquits herself well whilst Dickie tends to phone it in. Interesting as a curio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kim Stanley and Richard Attenborough gave fine performances in this eerie film about a dysfunctional couple, she is a seer, who meticulously plan a kidnapping.Miss Stanley is the epitome of evil. She evokes eerie images each time she is on the screen. Soft spoken and sinister, Kim Stanley gave a masterful performance as Mrs. Savage. Though she lost the Oscar, she did capture the N.Y.C. Film Critics Award.Evenly matched by Richard Attenborough's excellent portrayal of her milque-toast husband, who is reluctant to do this, both thespians gave unforgettable performances.The problem though is the film itself. Shot in black and white, Ms. Stanley's character does come off as a complete nut job. When he reads the ransom note to her, it's almost comical in nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>super dreary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was on TV about twelve thousand times when I was growing up. I can only assume that its copyright fell into the public domain for a couple of decades. It's common-ness meant I always managed to avoid it. But I've been on a British film kick and rented it. It's "drama" as drama is not done anymore, from a period that rejected the previous eras stagey, formulaic, dramatic conceits (a la Tennesee Williams) in favor of more finely observed filmic derangement. Kim Stanley is off her rocker here, but she's still presented as being in a delicate, pitiable state. Though you can see utter failure coming about one minute into things, the character study is intended to be of greater interest. I just didn't agree. In real life no one seeks out two hours with a passive-aggressive harpie like Stanley, so unless you're an extraordinary film-maker you've got a very difficult trick to pull off.The story in which it's clear from the get-go that the criminals are fatally flawed was familiar and modern by 1960 (The Killing, Bob le Flambeur) but is retro and outdated now. The failed crime movie is absolutely one of my least favorite genres, usually taking the form of a failed heist (Bottle Rocket, Rififi, Gun Crazy, Lavender Hill Mob) forcing audiences to sit through every last detail of a crime for no discernible reason, or worse; to learn a lesson in morality (ugh!). Which is probably why I was overjoyed at the multiple successful getaways in the Thomas Crowne remake.Some of the cinematography is very nice, but the movie is as dreary and exhausting as a two-hour visit to a nursing home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated drama that shouldn't annoy you if you're already asleep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not again. Not another viciously overrated old piece of crap. There is much here to annoy and bore, and almost nothing to entertain. It is truly frightening to think that a movie with so many gaps in logic is unanimously taken seriously by movie critics; just goes to show that film critics aren't the intellectuals that they so gladly try to promote themselves as. Dickie is good, but I haven't got a clue why they gave him a fake nose; this is neither a horror, nor a sci-fi, nor a comedy, nor is he playing a retired boxer, so why the silly nose? Stanley is simply annoying and too one-note with her affected, overly theatrical acting.First there is the dull intro that tries to establish mystery, mood, and evoke interest. Then Dickie kidnaps a millionaire's little daughter in a truly stupid manner: he dupes the chauffeur - who leaves the car with the girl in it AND the car's door open! After plenty of tedium and nothing happening (which includes a pointlessly dragged-out reading-out of the ransom note by Dickie), Stanley goes to the millionaire's house to show her prowess as a medium. Why the cops didn't immediately send a team to inspect her house is beyond me. When they finally do knock on their door, there is some glass getting shattered; what is THAT all about...? Stanley &amp; Dickie don't answer, and Stanley says confidently that the cops won't be coming again that evening, but next morning - and that is exactly what happens in this dumb piece of crap of a movie! That leaves them with a whole day to hide the girl elsewhere while a cop checks the house. Are we supposed to accept that Stanley is a real psychic? In a real horror film I'll accept anything - but not in this pretentious, light-headed drama. In the meantime, Dickie actually outwits the cops at a subway station; he takes the money but gets away! At one point he says: "I'm not a master criminal", but he sure as hell has the success of one! His character is that of a timid accountant-type, yet every criminal activity he does, he accomplishes with total efficiency! And why didn't the cops bring the chauffeur to the subway station to possibly identify the kidnapper (Dickie)?! That is just too stupid for a drama which feigns seriousness. At the end, when Magee and his fellow cops arrive at Dickie's home, again they don't have the chauffeur with them as their only witness! That last séance is real torture to sit through; to actually watch such a prolonged scene of Stanley over-act like an idiot was too much, especially since her monologue revealed that there is no doubt anymore that she is really a psychic! The biggest truth anyone utters in this film is when Magee says: "Time is not on our side". That's right; time works against the viewer, hence time is the biggest enemy. This superficial little movie poses as some kind of a serious character study about a woman going insane, and her loyal lap-dog husband's coping with her, but it is merely a badly written kidnapping story, badly acted by Stanley, and with a plethora of scenes that test the viewer's patience.</fullReview>
