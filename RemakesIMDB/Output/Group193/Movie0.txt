		<shortDescription>The Phantom City (1928) - Lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three people are mysteriously summoned to the deserted mining town of Gold City, Tim Kelly ( Ken Maynard ), Sally Ann Drew ( Eugenia Gilbert ), Tim's beautiful ward, and Joe Bridges ( Jim Mason ), part owner with Sally Ann of the abandoned and seemingly worthless Sally Ann mine. Bridges' men try to force their way into the mine, and two of them are shot by a mysterious phantom, who then warns Tim to keep away from the mine. Tim tries to force Bridges to sign over to him that share of the Sally Ann mine which had been appropriated from Tim's father by Bridges' father years before. Tim is tied up by Bridges, only to be freed by the phantom, who turns out to be Tim's father in disguise. Bridges steals the elder Kelly's gold, and Tim goes after him. Bridges is killed when his car goes off a cliff, and Tim returns to Sally Ann and his father with the stolen gold.This 1928 silent western/drama was produced by Charles R. Rogers Productions and distributed by First National Pictures. In 1932 the original negative of this film was cut up to be used as stock footage for the remake film, Haunted Gold.</fullReview>
