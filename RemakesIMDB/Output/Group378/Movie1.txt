		<shortDescription>Wayne carries this movie single-handedly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you might have noticed in some of my other reviews of John Wayne films, I am not exactly a huge fan of his later films (during the last 10 years of his life)--though there are exceptions, such as THE SHOOTIST. It's because the films look like they were just churned out--with occasionally silly scripts and Wayne playing more a caricature of himself than acting like he did in earlier films. Plus, in many of these films the supporting cast just seemed second-rate. This movie is a prime example of a second-rate cast. While Wayne is fine, there just isn't a lot of real support from anyone--no ensemble cast of Harry Carey (Junior OR Senior), Ward Bond, James Arness or even John Agar! Now considering some of these people were dead when the film was made, I could certainly understand the decision NOT to put them in the film. But, couldn't they have gotten some better actors instead? The only one worth watching was Jack Elam (who was GREAT) but he was only in the last half of the film and could have used a lot more screen time as the crazy old man. Although I've seen this movie 3 or 4 times, I can't even remember WHO the two supporting Confederate soldiers were or even what they looked like--and that's very unusual for me. The three ladies, though pretty, were also equally bland.So, overall this is a decent time passer for the average viewer (you can take it or leave it) and important for fans of John Wayne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3rd Time Remake Explores Humorous Side of Previous Pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that most John Wayne buffs would agree that this is a remake of 2 previous picture-"Rio Bravo",and "El Dorado".We have the same characters,the same basic situations,and the same resolutions.What I found interesting is the way that the "Duke"was able to kid his image in this one.He's not just strong,tough,brave,resourceful,and quick;he's also able to show a middle-aged man whose libido might not be as urgent as it was previously.Let's face it,being a lover isn't just performance,but also being tender and"comfortable"(the word that they use in this picture.)Let's not be too hasty about the performances of O'Neill,Rivero,and Mitchum-they were young and needed experience,and they got it in this film.(And Rivero is every bit as tasty looking as O'Neill.Isn't he delectable?)Nice to see Victor French as a porcine,slimy villain,and Mike Henry manages to play against his Tarzan image as the sheriff.I found him tough enough,and certainly brutish,but I didn't see him as quite enough of a sadist to go around cutting up women.David Huddleston does a first-rate job as Dr.Jones.The real acting honors of the evening,however,do go to the redoubtable Mr.Elam.This is a scenery-chewing,rip-roaring,over-the-top performance of such eye-rolling looniness that it's a joy to behold.Watch this film for fun,and don't take it too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Duke in Transition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I decided to write a review of Rio Lobo, I had every expectation of visiting the website and finding that the movie's weighted average was a 2.5. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's a 7.5, and that's actually a half-point higher than my own score. To cut to the chase: I liked Rio Lobo.It was fashionable in 1970 to trash Rio Lobo because (a) it was the supposedly feeble, last effort of a great director, Howard Hawks, who had supposedly lost interest in the picture; (b) it was too derivative of Rio Bravo and El Dorado; (c) the Duke was too old to play the part of a cavalry colonel (to say nothing of being too big; the average cavalryman in the Civil War was 5'7" and 135 lbs.); (d) the supporting cast was pathetic; (e) the production values were poor; and (f) the movie paled in comparison to Little Big Man, which was released at the same time. Much of the criticism was true. But, it was fun to watch, anyway. Ford had his cavalry trilogy, and Hawks had his Rio trilogy, and the Duke was in all six of them. The Ford set is a cut above the Hawks set, but all six films are worth watching. Ford was working with Wayne (1947-50) at a time when Wayne's acting ability was still very much in question. And Ford succeeded on every level, especially in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, where the character development of Capt. Nathan Brittles (Wayne) is nothing but sheer genius. Hawks, on the other hand, had (by 1959, in Rio Bravo) a very established star, and was thereby free to dwell more on story telling than he was on character development. Besides, with those amazing exteriors, the cinemagography alone was worth the cost of admission to all six pictures.The Duke was too old to play a romantic lead in this picture (but so was Cary Grant in his last picture, Walk, Don't Run, when he, too, was about 63 years-old.) The fact that he was not a "threat" to O'Neill's character (in those pre-Viagra days) was nothing more than an extension of the persona the Duke captured the year before in True Grit, and would continue to build on in such films as The Cowboys and The Shootist. Let's face it: Wayne was becoming a likeable old coot. Hawks was, according to reports, disappointed in Jennifer O'Neill, and by the last reel, her part has been cut in favor of Sherry Lansing's part. (Hawks did the same thing to John Ireland's part in Red River, 30 years earlier.) Actually, O'Neill didn't do THAT bad. My problem with her is that she couldn't decide whether she would play her part as the New York high-fashion model that she was, or as Kim Darby reprising her role in True Grit. At times, O'Neill's semi-imitation of Darby gets on one's nerves. And, Hawks was rightfully disappointed in the desultory performances of the supporting cast, with the exception of Lansing and Jack Elam. The Confederate cavalry captain: He might as well have been created by computer graphics, for all the vitality he brings to the role. But, take a look at the stock players, including Hank Worden ("Old Mose" in The Searchers) and Jim Davis (Jock Ewing of Dallas fame). These are virtually cameos, if not walk-on parts, but they are effective.I do not think Hawks gave up on this film, at least, not to the extent that people have claimed. Yakima Canutt ably handled the second unit, and the train hijacking he directed (with Hawks' help) was unusual and exciting; the cinematography, but for the occasional lighting or filtering error, was acceptable; and the editing was fairly crisp. The interior sets were shabby, that is true.But what carries the picture is the wonderful dialogue, and Wayne. The dialogue is "pure Hawks": spare, unambiguous, natural, and realistic. Wayne's onscreen personal is so great, and his presence so magnificent, that all of the films shortcomings are rendered irrelevant. Thank you, Mr. Hawks. Well done. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Howard Hawks loved this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be unique in the history of Hollywood. Leading director and screen legend Howard Hawks loved this film so much that they made three variations of the same movie. By the time Rio Lobo was made, the theme was getting a bit thin, but it's still grand entertainment.The first part of the film is set during the Civil War with John Wayne pursuing Confederates who are stealing army payrolls. He does catch up with them and the Civil War ends. He befriends his erstwhile enemies and asks for their help in locating the informer who was giving them information.That all sets the scene for the third variant of Rio Bravo/El Dorado theme. Playing the old codger part is Jack Elam who by now had quit being a screen menace and was doing comedy and doing it well. The two younger sidekicks are the former Confederate enemies, Jorge Rivero and Chris Mitchum.Rio Lobo had the presence of two stars of the Mexican cinema, Jorge Rivero and Susana Dosamantes. Dosamantes played Mitchum's girlfriend and Jennifer O'Neill played the Angie Dickinson part although Wayne was now deciding he was too old for the romance. She pairs off with Rivero.In a small bit part is Sherry Lansing who left acting soon after Rio Lobo and really hit the big time, going into the production end of the movie business and becoming head of first 20th Century Fox and later CEO of Paramount.The two principal villains are Victor French who played the neighbor on Little House On The Prarie and Mike Henry who was one of several screen Tarzans.It's a good John Wayne western and that takes in a whole lot of territory pilgrim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rio Too Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing a John Wayne movie where Wayne himself is the most vital presence is normal for just about any film he was in. Seeing a John Wayne movie where he is the most accomplished and subtle actor on screen, the Olivier of the proceedings, is quite another, and just one of several reasons "Rio Lobo" sticks out in a bad way.Wayne plays Union Col. Cord McNally, who after the end of the American Civil War is still after the traitors who sold information about U.S. Army gold shipments that led to the death of a beloved subordinate. McNally finds himself in the middle of a land grab involving two ex-Confederates who knew the traitors in question, and what's more, are now being oppressed by the same baddies in the Texas village of Rio Lobo. Former enemies join forces to see to the righting of a wrong.Everything about this film is wrong from the start, from the opening titles where we see a guitar played totally out of sync with the tune on the soundtrack to a train robbery scene full of awkward exposition lines to alert us to the fact the train is carrying gold and is being waylaid by Confederates armed with grease and hornets. How Howard Hawks, director of some of Wayne's best films like "Rio Bravo" and "Red River" as well as some choice Hollywood classics, could have made this lame oater his swansong is a question almost existential in its bleakness.Wayne's supporting actors make him seem Shakespearean by comparison. Future movie executive Sherry Lansing shows why she saved her best work for behind the camera as a vengeful senorita, while Jorge Rivero just seems hideously miscast as an Omar Sharif wanna-be playing the Confederate commander Col. McNally first clashes against, then joins sides with. Apparently he is one of those Confederate officers who talks like Desi Arnez or Fernando Lamas. Bracing for a train crash, he yells to his men: "You better find yourself a place with a good hold," but the way he says it makes you think he's in a New Orleans cathouse.All this is by way of introducing Jennifer O'Neill's terrible turn as the lead female in this production, Shasta Delaney. To see her is to reconsider every supposed movie actor you have labeled "bad" in movies. A woman of rare beauty who leans on her looks all too much, O'Neill is always brushing her hair away from her face and sounding much like the high school homecoming queen drafted in a Shakespearean tragedy. Listening to her say simple lines like "Don't be nice to me" is grating in its banality, not to mention a dunning reminder of how competent Joanne Dru really was playing the lead hottie in the Hawks film "Red River" nearly 25 years before, when she actually managed to carry entire scenes with real dramatic purpose and charm. Its not that Hawks stopped using his casting couch, perchance, just that his standards had slipped so in the interim.Ah, yes, then there's Wayne, stolid, boring, inert, yet the only thing that keeps us going from scene to scene. He can be so great in many different films; that's what makes him such a joy to follow, and though he's so dull in this one, it's not all his fault.There's a moment, for example, near the beginning, when someone asks him about a comrade in danger, about how long McNally served with the fellow, and McNally replies: "Since the war began." The way Wayne says it, just the aching delivery in his voice, recalls a succession of battlefields, and you realize how powerful an actor Wayne could be without even trying. I can't really blame him for showing up for work when Hawks asked him to. I imagine on his second day on the set with O'Neill and the English-impaired Rivero, he just thought of all the good work Hawks had sent his way before and remembered that Oscar keeping his bed warm back in his trailer. Wayne's not great, but he's good enough for the lameness around him, which is enough.So are Christopher Mitchum, Susana Dosamantes, and David Huddleston as a would-be sadistic dentist who pretends to give McNally a thorough going-over while imparting some vital information toward the resolution of the plot, sending him off with a nasty novocain shot and the line: "If you'd have been a good enough actor, I wouldna used it!" Wayne was a good sport to let himself get zinged that way, but the truth be told, he's the least of the problem as far as "Rio Lobo" is concerned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as bad as people make out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an excellent start with the train ambush, the movie loses steam and never really picks up, an unhappy way for a great director like Hawks to bow out. But I did not get too bored and was happy enough to stick it out to the end, even though the writing is too flat and derivative with echos of half a dozen better movies. Rivero lacks the charisma that could have helped to save things but I do not think O'Neill is as bad as some reviewers claim ? not expressive enough with her dialogue at this stage but I think you can see the spark that gave her a respectable career in movies. But, as usual, Wayne saves the day. Even in a disappointing movie like this, that enormous screen presence reminds you just what a great star he was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much maligned, better than you're told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, put down the film criticism texts and just watch this fun movie for what it is. Feels like a TV movie, but several cuts above one. The opening train robbery sequence is pretty damn breathtaking for a "bad" movie. Bet some action directors have studied that one. "Lobo" is collection of a lot of good Hawks-ian moments recycled, sort of like a retrospective of his bag of tricks ie. "Yer necks broken," etc. The Duke aging, beat up, but still The Duke. Sherry Lansing pretty hot looking in her one role. Jack Elam the scene stealer. Too bad they didn't have the money to cast the other parts better--Mitchum or Martin would have helped a lot. Duke looks a little lonely. Plot sorta strung together, but Hawks was concentrating more on characters in his Bravo/Dorado/Lobo "trilogy." "Smart" dialog, while not up to 30s &amp; 40s banter, still has clever moments by today's standards. Clever rifle bit at the end shows old timers' practical knowledge of things, like weapons. If you like old westerns, you'll like this one. Not among his greatest, but low end Hawks is better than no Hawks. I've seen much thinner stuff win awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great train robbery, score, women &amp; cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1970, Howard Hawks' "Rio Lobo" starts with a thrilling Confederate train robbery of a Union gold shipment. After the war, Col. McNally (John Wayne) buddies up with Confederate Capt. "Frenchie" (Jorge Rivero) to try to track down the Union traitors indirectly responsible for the gold robberies and the death of his close comrade and spiritual son. The trail leads to the Texas town Rio Lobo and a showdown.POSITIVES:- One of the main reasons I bought "Rio Lobo" was the opening guitar score by Jerry Goldsmith. This sequence features an exceptional two-guitar piece with the camera zeroed-in closely on an acoustic guitar and the guitarist's hands. Sometimes I put this movie on just to see this part. - The first half hour involves the Confederate train robbery and ensuing conflicts, which really make the film stand out from other Westerns. It's a great sequence, convincing and original. Civil War devotees should seek out "Rio Lobo" just for this. - Three notable women are featured: Jennifer O'Neill, Susana Dosamantes and Sherry Lansing who went on to became president of 20th Century-Fox and, later, chairman of Paramount Pictures (Lansing is the scarred girl Wayne more or less rides off into the sunset with). I've heard jokes/comments over the years about the number of babes in the town of Rio Lobo, most single. But, really, there's only two in the town: Maria (Susan), who is seeing Frenchie's comrade, and Lansing, who isn't all that exceptional anyway; O'Neill was just passing through as part of some snake oil show. - The protagonists -- McNally (Wayne), Frenchie (Rivero), Shasta (O'Neil) and others (e.g. Jack Elam, Christopher Mitchum, Dosamantes and Lansing) -- have good chemistry and camaraderie. The film was made right after the advent of the Spaghetti Western, which was known for amorality and lack of character depth &amp; camaraderie. The protagonists in Italo-Westerns were almost always antiheroes rather than heroes; they were grim, silent, one-dimensional killing machines, very comic-booky, e.g. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Charles Bronson and Franco Nero (Django). While these types of characters are great when you're 13-20, they don't cut it when you're an adult and require more depth and realism. Don't get me wrong, the Spaghetti-Westerns added (or perfected) a cool new style and grim sense of realism to the Western, but they accomplished this at the expense of morality, character depth and social realism. This explains why Clint Eastwood combined elements of both to forge the exceptional "The Outlaw Josey Wales" in 1976 after the decline of the Italo-Western. Needless to say, it's nice to have a group of likable characters in "Rio Lobo" who get along and you can root for. - An exceptional example of this good-natured companionship is shown in the middle of the film before the protagonists reach Rio Lobo. McNally, Frenchie and Shasta are camping out in the desert where the running joke of McNally being "comfortable" for women (but not romantically attractive) starts. I love that scene. - Great Mexican &amp; Arizona locations. (I'm not sure if the opening Civil War sequences were filmed in Arizona but, if so, they did a great job of making it look like the East).NEGATIVES:- The story is very disjointed. The opening Civil War sequence seems like a different film. And it takes about an hour just to make it to the titular Texas town, but I've been able to adapt to this over the years and enjoy the latter portions of the film. - Some have complained about the acting, particularly O'Neill, Rivero and Mitchum, but is this their fault or the writer's fault? Regardless, I just chalk it up to the distinctiveness of the actors. I've met numerous unique people in life who act strangely, but it's really just their special individuality or style, e.g. Gary Cooper &amp; John Wayne. I think that's the case here more than anything else. - A few scenes are unconvincing. For instance, when Frenchie suddenly darts into Lansing's house while she's dressing, which is their first meeting; the ensuing conversation just doesn't smack of reality. I suppose the filmmakers were shooting for something amusing, but it seems patched in from another movie. Or the later episode where the protagonists raid the ranch house at night: people are lurking just around the corner and they aren't able to hear the various nearby (obviously loud) assaults? Why sure! - The opening score is only heard a couple of more times, briefly, but not with guitars like the opening. This score was too great to be heard in such a limited capacity. Why not at least utilize it for the ending? This was a huge mistake."Rio Lobo" has similarities to Hawks' "Rio Bravo" (1959) and "El Dorado" (1967), both also with Wayne, but "Rio Lobo" is far from a remake of either. It has its own individual story. Of the three I like "Rio Lobo" the most followed closely by "El Dorado."BOTTOM LINE: "Rio Lobo" is unique and underrated. Yes the story is disjointed and there are a few unconvincing scenes, which make the film seem dated compared to contemporaneous Westerns like "Duel At Diablo" or "Bandolero!" But "Rio Lobo" possesses quite a few aspects that are really good and even great, like the opening score &amp; guitar sequence, the thrilling train robbery &amp; Civil War parts, the likable protagonists &amp; their camaraderie, the beautiful women and stunning Mexican locations.It goes without saying, If you've seen "Rio Lobo" and felt it was mediocre give it another chance; it grows on you with repeat viewings.GRADE: BThe film runs 114 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wayne helped by a motley group taking on a corrupt baron land and a villainous marshal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Involving and fascinating Western with crisp action , masterfully directed by Howard Hawks , being a take-off based on ¨Rio Bravo¨ and ¨El Dorado¨ mold . After the Civil War, Union ex-Colonel Cord McNally (John Wayne ) searches for the traitor whose perfidy originated the defeat of his unit and the loss of a close friend (Edward Faulkner) . The Duke then out to settle some old scores . In addition to an ex-Confederate officer (Jorge Rivero ) and an ex-sergeant ( Chris Mitchum) with whom he forms an uneasy alliance . They go to a little town called Rio Lobo where rules an ominous marshal (Mike Henry) and a heinous baron land named Ketchan (Victor French) . But the Duke takes prisoner Ketchan and imprisons him into jail for being brought to justice . Then he takes on a blockade of gunfighters and the nasty sheriff is out to get his kill-crazy boss . Duke along with a shotgun-toting old loony (the scene-stealing Jack Elam) are besieged and only helped by the Mexican/French ex-captain and the hot-headed Sergeant Tuscarora .Action western, snappy dialog , shoot-outs at regular intervals, and humor abounds in this magnificent film whose roles are splendidly portrayed . It packs larger-than-life characters, uproarious events and lively happenings. The Duke carries strong acting on his brawny shoulders and perfectly does. It's basically a lighthearted , upside B Western and being mainly lifted out by veteran Jack Elam 's wonderfully acting as a half-crazed sympathetic old man , whose finger itches demoniacally on the trigger every time he gets a nasty guy in his sights . And of course, top-drawer John Wayne , few stars could match his ability to dominate a scene . Delightful supporting cast formed by several youthful costars as Chris Mitchum , Robert's son who starred Rio Bravo ; a gorgeous Jennifer O'Neill , recent his hit in Summer of 42 ; Sherry Lansing's last movie as an actress who married William Fredkin and future Paramount studio head ; Susana Dosamontes who married a magnate and gave birth the singer Paulina Rubio . Glittering Technicolor cinematography by William H Clothier who adds much to the setting of this unique Western . Marvelous musical score by Jerry Goldsmith including emotive guitar playing . This overlong, too much-acclaimed and very gripping Western will appeal to John Wayne fans . Rating : Above average, essential and indispensable Western , a masterpiece horse opera whose reputation has improved over the years . The motion picture is well directed Howard Hawks supported by John Wayne , it's a nice Western made by these two giants . Hawks proved to be a Western expert as ¨Big sky¨, ¨The outlaw¨ and ¨Red River ¨.Rating : Good and great fun , though over lengthy and displays a number of similarities to previous ¨Rio Bravo¨ , quintaessential Hawks Western at the peak of his powers , starred by Walter Brennan , Ricky Nelson , Angie Dickinson and ¨El Dorado¨ with James Caan , Edward Ashner and Arthur Hunnicut virtual retreat of the previous role played by Walter Brennan and again by Jack Elam in ¨Rio Lobo¨in this second reworking of Rio Bravo; and of course the great John Wayne who repeats in the excellent trilogy .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Too Great, But Not Too Bad Either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the Civil War, Cord McNally searches for the traitor whose perfidy caused the defeat of McNally's unit and the loss of a close friend.Rio Lobo is a movie that marks the end of an era. What I mean is, that this movie has a few lasts to it. This movie is the last movie that Howard Hawks ever directed, not to mention that it is also the last movie that Howard Hawks and John Wayne ever made together, marking the end of a long collaboration. What is my opinion on this movie? Basically, if he wanted to, John Wayne could have singlehandedly carried this movie. There's nothing really wrong with Rio Lobo, as it is somewhat of a good film, but its basically something that we've seen before. Meaning that this movie is a rehash of the previous Wayne/Hawks collaboration El Dorado, which itself was a rehash of an even earlier collaboration, Rio Bravo. As a result, this movie basically becomes a "been there, done that" kind of thing, meaning that while it is enjoyable, it is something that's basically been already done before. But like I said, the movie does have a few things that make it worth watching, so that's not too bad.John Wayne could have carried this movie by himself if he wanted, as he basically was the best person in the movie in my opinion, probably because of the fact that he was being directed by Howard Hawks, and the Wayne/Hawks collaboration was like the Wayne/John Ford collaboration, a combo with chemistry. Mike Henry was pretty good in his role as Sheriff Hendricks, the villain of the film. Jennifer O'Neal, Christopher Mitchum, and Jorge Rivero among others were pretty good, but John Wayne stood out the most. The movie also has what would appeal to people who like Westerns, it has action and gunfights. Had I seen this movie before I saw Rio Bravo, I might have enjoyed it more, but unfortunately, I did see Rio Bravo first, and as a result, I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I wanted to enjoy it.Basically, if you have seen Rio Bravo, then you probably won't be getting much out of this movie, as it is basically a rehash of Rio Bravo, as well as El Dorado, which itself was just a pretty good film. While Rio Lobo itself is not terrible, it's just not one of the greatest films of all time, pure and simple, nothing deeper than that. If you want to see this movie, then you probably should keep an open mind about it, and try not to think of it being like Rio Bravo. To end on a more positive note, the movie is well scored by Jerry Goldsmith, who was a master of film scores, needless to say. And also, I do give credit to John Wayne for playing the kind of character that he was best at, a character who is seeking vengeance after the death of a close friend, which he seemed to have a talent for playing.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm as big of a John Wayne fan as anyone but this has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen in which he starred. I have seen conflicting information in this space about what Hawks thought about his last effort, but it's difficult to believe that the same man who directed The Big Sleep, His Girl Friday, To Have and Have Not, Twentieth Century and Red River turned out this dog. The main problem is the level of the acting. Wayne turns in the only decent performance in the film. The quality of each and every one of the supporting cast is universally abysmal, excepting David Huddleston. Not only that the plot line seems to get bogged down about halfway through. The script is pretty tacky as well. I managed to get about halfway through before I couldn't take anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally got a chance to see this classic! It was a 1st in many ways, Hawks final film, Peter Jason and Sandra Currie's film debut, the rare pairing of Wayne with Jorge Rivero.As always the larger-than-life John Wayne is the star. And he shines in his role of Col. Cord McNally. A little over-the-hill type of guy who's not comfortable with the word "comfortable"! For me it was a treat to see the great Jorge Rivero as the young and strong-looking, Capt. Pierre Cordona aka Frenchy. but as always Hollywood does it again as I have noticed in countless pictures, why is it that whenever a minority , in this case a Latino, who does not look like your typical minority because of great presence or muscularity or stature or color-eyes, has to be a mix?? Or half- breed per say?? Ever notice that? But because he can't be all white, he has to be mix with something, half-white or in this case, half-French. Just a observation... Anyways, Rivero did OK and held his own with The Duke but he was still young and had a lot to learn. I can't tell if that was his real voice or dubbed though.The beautiful Jennifer O'Neill fared a little better as the feisty and tough Shasta Delaney but not for one minute did I buy the so-called 'love' that blossomed between her and Rivero. She actually came on like a snobbish witch to me but it was what the role demanded I guess. I wish the Duke would have just flung her over his knees and given her a good spanking! It was what she deserved.The ever reliable, dependable Jack Elam stole the picture for me. He came on quite late but once he did, he made every scene count. And man he had me laughing with his crazed, loony, punch-drunk Phillips. You could tell the Duke was just holding back from laughing as well in the scenes with Elam.Christopher Mitchum did pretty good as Rivero's partner in crime,Sgt. Tuscarora Phillips. I liked the interplay between him and the Duke.The late Victor French as Ketcham (boss of Rio Lobo) did OK. He really didn't have much to do but be at the mercy of The Duke and Elam and be held hostage.The lovely Susana Dosamantes did the typical ethnic role of María Carmen. But she handle it well I believe. It's interesting to know that she and Rivero later co-starred in so many Spanish-speaking films later on.In a weird bit of casting but in a good sexy way, Shelly Lansing oozed a bit of sexiness in a scene with Rivero, her being half-naked and all, as the lovely but doomed Amelita. Their scene, which was brief, was more believable in terms of chemistry than O'Neill's and Rivero's.The great David Huddleston as Dr. Ivor Jones the Rio Lobo dentist, was also a treat as was Elam's. The scene of Jones with the Duke faking a pulled tooth was a hoot.The imposing Mike Henry had an OK role as the Rio Lobo Sheriff 'Blue Tom' Hendricks. I wish he and The Duke would have had a fist-fight or something but it didn't happen. Rumor has it that Wayne was not doing well health wise when filming this picture. Even Hawks says that was the reason he felt the picture did not do well in the box office or with the critics.The late Jim Davis as a Rio Lobo Deputy was way too short and I felt he was wasted in a minor role.I didn't even see the late George Plimpton or hear the famous one-line which was the basis for a TV special.The great Peter Jason made quite a debut as Lt. Forsythe the gold train detail officer! Being stung by hornets and jumping off a train and subsequently breaks his neck and dies! And the beautiful Sondra Currie made a super brief uncredited debut as a Blackthorne Prostitute with one line that Rivero kicks out of his room to make room for a fainted O'Neill.The late great Bob Steele makes a uncredited bit as a Rio Lobo Deputy.The late great Hank Worden does also a uncredited bit as Hank, a Hotel Clerk.And last but not least, The Duke had one of his sons, Ethan Wayne, in a uncredited cameo bit. (I didn't see him) :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't say comfortable eh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of Paramount Pictures, Rio Lobo is directed and produced by Howard Hawks (the last film he would direct) and stars John Wayne, Jorge Rivero, Jeniffer O'Neill, Jack Elam &amp; Christopher Mitchum. It's written by Leigh Brackett &amp; Burton Wohl, musically scored by Jerry Goldsmith and photographed by William H. Clothier on location at Cuernavaca, Mexico &amp; Tuscon, Arizona. It's the third film in a loose trilogy by Hawks &amp; Wayne that follows Rio Bravo (1959) &amp; El Dorado (1966). Plot follows Wayne as Union officer Cord McNally who loses gold shipments (via the railway) to Confederate guerrillas led by Pierre Cordona (Rivero) &amp; Tuscarora Phillips (Mitchum). It's the start of a relationship that will see all parties end up in Rio Lobo, Texas, where a traitor and a despotic sheriff are in their midst.Rio Lobo is easily the weakest Western that Hawks made with Duke Wayne. He himself would say that he didn't like the film, felt it wasn't any good, while Wayne himself was quoted as saying that he had already made the film twice before. Almost everything about Rio Lobo is tired, from the formula of the story to Wayne sleepwalking thru a role that held no challenge, it's a poor send off for one of America's finest directors. The script is solid enough, with many Hawksian themes evident; and it's nice to see the three lady characters be important to the story, but the cast put around Wayne are poor and out of their depth and this rubs off on the normally professional Wayne who finds he has nothing to act off of.It's not a total stinker, tho, certainly Clothier's photography and Goldsmith's score are worthy of investing time with, and the lead off sequence involving the train robbery is well put together and stirs the adrenalin. Sadly the film is never able to reach those heights again, with the ending being a rather tame affair that doesn't do justice to the bitter revenge tone that Hawks has steered the film towards. Of the sub-standard support cast there's only Jack Elam who is worth watching, be it for comedy value or for just giving it some gusto. All told the film just about comes out as watchable Sunday afternoon fodder. A running theme in the film sees fun poked at the ageing Wayne's expense, one of which involves the word comfortable. That is an apt word to use for Rio Lobo, because director and star are in the comfort zone, comfortably making an unchallenging and old hat movie. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The final film is Howard Hawks The good guys vs bad guys trilogy(as i like to call it)is set during the closing days of the civil war and involves military secrets being sold the other side,a robbery in gold,and one mans quest for vengeance and justice.First of all,this is one of the greatest westerns ever made,it got brilliant acting,perfect storyline and excellently staged,fast paced action scenes.John Wayne is again reprising his role as a Man on a Mission,and he's brilliant at it(in one scene he turns the tables on his captors which results in them being sent to a POW camp),other good performances come from Mike Henry who plays the sadistic town sheriff,Jack Elam is really funny as the bitter old man who helps the duke on his quest and David Huddleston is great as the town dentist,some of the scenes in this movie are nearly the same as El Dorado(food being brought to the sheriffs office which is under siege).The storyline is excellent as it focuses a lot on betrayal and revenge,the dukes friend is killed in a train robbery and he sets out intent on finding those responsible,the idea of military secrets falling into the wrong hands was great and it gives the movie the feel of a spy thriller.There's plenty of good old western action to enjoy,including a train robbery,a house being raided and an epic shootout to climax the film,during which many a man is shot and dynamite is tossed around and a building is blown up(it quite similar to the shootout at the end of Rio Bravo),the action is very loud and it's really exciting.This is a gem of a movie,i recommend it to all John Wayne and western fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne and a few of his friends -- including two younger men and a crazy old coot with a shotgun -- take Ketchum, the principal heavy, captive and hole up in the Sheriff's Office of Rio Lobo. The old codger has instructions to lock the prisoner up and shoot him if anything develops. One of the good guys is captured while riding for help.An exchange of prisoners is arranged. The good guy will be released from the barn where the gang is holding him, the bad guy from the cantina where Wayne and a few of his pals are waiting. Halfway across the little bridge over the creek, things go awry. The bad guy winds up dead, along with a couple of his thugs, and Wayne sustains a leg wound.Lamentably, this is not "Rio Bravo" or even "El Dorado" but a dark and nebulous combination of both. When I called the local theater to see what was playing, the character on the other end replied, "Rio Lobbo." It turned out to be an apt error.There are differences, naturally, between Hawks' two earlier successes and this, his last movie. This one has a Civil War introduction but it's not essential to the plot. Nobody is a drunk in this one. Wayne doesn't get the girl, Jennifer O'Neal, but his next in charge does. Wayne himself is described by her as merely "comfortable." Those differences don't really count for much. They might be an advantage or might not. But other differences are important and they all contribute to the somewhat depressing tone of the movie.Hawks has one movie star in this one, with unimpeachable credentials, and that's John Wayne -- and he's getting pretty old. Nobody else comes close to matching his presence. Some of the performances -- that of Sherry Lansing as a local Mexican belle, for one -- are embarrassing. (She went on to great success as a producer.) But the fact is that none of the supporting players is in any way memorable. They have all the reactivity of a noble gas. The story itself is unfocused. The music is not by Dmitri Tiomkin. The set dressing is shabby and generic, rather than full of colorful artifacts like the potted plants in "Rio Bravo's" hotel or the Mexican blankets and agreeable bunks and knicknacks in the jail.I don't find the movie irritating. I find it saddening. Hawks made some marvelous films in various genres from the thirties onward but he was in his 70s when this was shot in Old Tucson and he was well past his prime. Of course, no one ever knows when they've run out of ideas until they reach a point at which it becomes obvious to everyone. The ages at which skills deteriorate vary a lot, depending on the professional arena. Mathematicians flare up and die early. Tournament-level chess players go on into their 80s. For film directors, the age at which they should begin thinking of a graceful retirement seems to be about sixty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fan Frustrated By Film's Finances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface by saying that I am a HUGE John Wayne fan, and Mr. Hawks has made some of the best films in Hollywood history...films like His Girl Friday, The Big Sleep, To Have and Have Not...and of course two of Wayne's best: Red River and Rio Bravo.Rio Bravo is probably my favorite John Wayne film, and in my top three of all-time favorite Westerns. It was hard enough to sit through El Dorado, which was a truly sub-par remake, but at least El Dorado still managed to be entertaining most of the way through. Rio Lobo is horrendous, the dialog atrocious, the acting abominable, and the direction uninspired. John Wayne actually looks older here than he does in almost every film that would follow, so I must assume his health was at an especially low point during the filming.In spite of being a man who was badly bloated, unable to breathe for long without an oxygen tank, and who looked dead tired/bored, Mr. Wayne was the only bright point in this entire mess. I see that almost everyone else who reviewed this movie loved Jack Elam. I guess everyone's taste is different...to me, he belonged in an "Apple Dumpling Gang" type of movie, not this one. And when you compare him to Walter Brennan in Rio Bravo, it's embarrassing. Walter Brennan was quirky and, some might say, a bit over the top, but there isn't a person out there that could accuse him of not being completely real and believable on screen. You believed Walter Brennan really was a humorous, wise-cracking guy named Stumpy, not someone who was thrown in because the studio wanted some comic relief. Jack Elam, in his prime, was the epitome of menace on the screen, but his comic caricature here just didn't play for me.John Wayne is an American legend, international film hero, box office giant, and one of the most beloved actors of all time, yet he couldn't find a studio that would give him enough money to hire anyone better than Jennifer O'Neil, Sherry Lansing, and the beyond-dreadful Jorge Rivero? Having worked for most of my life in Hollywood, I am all too familiar with the industry's maniacal obsession with the bottom line, but give me a break...this was John Wayne!! To me, it was a crime to leave him out there dangling alone. All studios end up doing when they scrimp and save is produce garbage...then they have the nerve to complain that the star turns out garbage...then they complain that the audiences aren't coming to see that star's movies...and then they give even less money the next time around. Geniuses.There are so many far superior John Wayne films, Howard Hawks films, and Wayne-Hawks collaborations, that you are doing yourself a disservice wasting precious time watching Rio Lobo. This film is only good for checking to see if the fast forward button on your DVD player's remote works properly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being the John Wayne/Howard Hawks fan that I am, I expected great things from "Rio Lobo." Unfortunately, it's one of the Duke's weakest efforts. Howard Hawks has a style all of his own, but none of it is in evidence here. As a matter of fact, the one thing this picture reminds me of is those cheesy A.C. Lyles westerns from the '60s, which were made cheap and loaded with familiar faces like Rory Calhoun, Howard Keel, Rod Cameron, etc.The biggest problem in this film is the performances of the younger cast members. Jennifer O'Neill is ravishingly beautiful but can't act her way out of a paper bag. Her scenes with Rivero are among the most embarrassing on record. Rivero has trouble with English and seems to be reciting his lines phonetically; O'Neill doesn't seem to have the slightest idea of what she is doing. She steps on other actors' lines, forgets hers, misses cues, and is a pretty good argument for models not being paid for opening their mouths. Future studio head Sherry Lansing has a small part as a Mexican girl who ges beaten up by bad sheriff Mike Henry; she was a much better studio head than an actress. It's up to the old pros like Wayne, Bill Williams, Jim Davis, Victor French and especially David Huddlestson as a frontier dentist to give this picture some semblance of professionalism, performance-wise. Jack Elam as an ornery old codger gives an over-the-top performance that is nevertheless fun to watch. Mike Henry is quite good as a sadistic, crooked sheriff. Yakima Canutt staged the rousing action scenes with his usual flair, and there's a good Jerry Goldsmith score. Unfortunately, however, the trite script and the incompetent performances are obstacles that neither Hawks nor Wayne can overcome. O'Neill has a line early in the film that pretty much sums up her performance: "I'm acting like an idiot, aren't I?"Yup.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Complicated, But Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the Civil War, Cord McNally (John Wayne) searches for the traitor whose perfidy caused the defeat of McNally's unit, a shipment of gold to be stolen, and the loss of a close friend.I loved the beginning with the train robbery. Every part of it was executed perfectly, and the first ten minutes or so are probably the highlight of the film. And then the idea that the yanks and rebels could be friends was questionable but nice... and the shift from the war and the heist to tracking down a traitor, great. But it seemed to have a good deal of turns and subplots that were not quite necessary.The worst was Jennifer O'Neill, who played Shasta. I would gladly give this film another star if it was not for her. Every line was delivered so poorly. I guess Howard Hawks feared John Wayne was too old for the role... I thought Wayne was great. It was O'Neill that was the weak link. She just has no acting ability to speak of.Also, a special nod to Jack Elam, who was the comic relief. His wit and delivery (almost) make up for O'Neill, and on that count I have revised my 6 stars in 2015 to 7 stars in 2016 upon a second viewing. This may not be the best known Hawks-Wayne collaboration, but it certainly has its strong points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts in the Civil War and progresses from there. I don't know if the Rebs ever had an with a Latin accent but it is okay. The bee hive trick is a nice switch from blocking and blowing up the train. Wayne plays what appears to be his favorite rank, a Union colonel. He catches the two Rebs who engineered the robbery, jails them and meets them when the war is over to try and find out who the Union traitor was. Now civilians they proceed the town of Rio Lobo Here they run into Jennifer O'Neill who does a poor acting job in my opinion. They meet Jack Elam in town and he joins the team. I think Elam is fantastic in this role, funny as all get out. Of course they eventually find the bad guy and his crew, fight it out and win.</fullReview>

Also in town are Robert's son Christopher Mitchum (as Tuscarora Phillips) and his pa Jack Elam (as "Old Man" Phillips). Proving the law of diminishing returns for his last film, herein, director Howard Hawks re-visits "El Dorado" (1966) which had re-visited "Rio Bravo" (1959). Ms. O'Neill's line, "I was running out of things to say" may apply. She is very beautiful, but needed to go over lines with her co-stars (or, maybe she did). The script seems to poke fun at Mr. Wayne's age, weight ("He's heavier than a baby whale."), and acting ("If you'd been a good enough actor.") with good-natured humor. It only helps a little.**** Rio Lobo (12/17/70) Howard Hawks ~ John Wayne, Jorge Rivero, Jennifer O'Neill, Jack Elam</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Like Two Different Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic problem with "Rio Lobo" is the script. It's dreadful. Set during the Civil War, the plot begins with a Confederate Rebel train robbery of a Union gold shipment. This twenty minute sequence is a long, tedious, drawn-out affair. Then, the plot shifts to a different focus, as character motivations make a dramatic U-turn, and we move from a Civil War setting to a Western setting.Except for Cord McNally (John Wayne), Pierre Cordona (Jorge Rivero), and Tuscarora (Chris Mitchum), characters in the last third of the film bear no relation to characters in the first third of the film. Indeed, the entire plot seems put together with loose strands that barely connect.Once we get to the Western town of Rio Lobo, at least the daytime visuals look good, with convincing production design and costumes, even if the reason we're here is unclear and confusing. Yet, though the daytime images look fine, nighttime scenes look fake owing to the use of camera filters.Casting is dubious. John Wayne looks too old for the role he plays. Rivero and Mitchum seem too inexperienced. Acting trends below average; I'm not sure any of the actors took their roles seriously. Given McNally's motivation, Wayne plays the role too sweetly and amiably, hardly the tough and intense character we would expect.The best that can be said for "Rio Lobo" is that some of the daytime camera shots are quite pleasing, in that they convey images that romanticize the Old West. Apart from that, the production is far from ideal. But the most serious weakness is a script that needed a complete rewrite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just watch the movie and decide for yourself. Truly a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, those other reviews that slam the different facets of this movie are probably made by others who have nothing better to do with their time. This flick is really interesting from beginning to end. Starting with the great train robbery and ending with the shoot-out at the ranch, this movie never lets up. The dialogue amongst the actors is typically basic, like a lot of westerns, but it is to the point like most westerns as well. The set designs are also very western and entertaining-looking to the point that I wish I was actually a part of it and enjoying it. The romance between the two actors is funny and very real in a way in terms of a silly but serious man trying to court an almost hysterical but serious woman. The supporting actresses all do a very good job in their roles and are all unusually beautiful but are all rather calm and know how to handle their situations in their worlds on the set. Even the lead bad guy, the new sheriff, doesn't "look" like a typical western bad dude, however he portrays himself as a true leader and seems to be in full control of all the other dudes in his posse. Jack Elam, of course, is the wacky guy, but really knows how to kick ass if pushed, which is the type we need any more these days in our world. But, for a "wacky" dude, he seems to be also a type that is worthy of deep respect in his own right, and that may be because he seems to know what is right for the world and will stand up for it no matter what. I can go on about this flick, but my point in this review is that one needs to just simply watch the movie with your own eyes and just relax and enjoy it for all that it is worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun but silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hawks approaching a cherished genre after the European style had swept the tropes and the locations; the result of Hawks' comeback was a goofy movie, silly (even immeasurably silly) but fun nonetheless. A yank officer guides a band of Dixie train robbers through the enemy lines, then he fools them, and the war is over, witty camp with jingling spurs ('it smells good', exults Wayne when Tuscarora's broad brings them the dinner ?), Hawks chosen camp rather than good-natured humor, so it looks like a spoof of some Italian camp ?, three comrades get to Rio Lobo at the half of the movie, and the plot begins to resemble those of the '30s (but without the excitement), anyway it seems comforting to bring up irony and spoof, whether they show up indeed, or not, but 'Rio Lobo' is also sometimes silly, the gallantry included; and Wayne looked as if this was a Western with Gabin. The Rio Lobo action was silly, even with the kind of hopeless silliness of the 'Magnificent Seven' crass sequels, so Hawks as a gravedigger of the genre. But the final shootout was cool, with Mike Henry as the wicked sheriff, and the blonde Mitchum ?. And I liked Sherry Lansing ('Amelita', who we gather would be Wayne's reward).An unconvinced movie, disbelieved by all those involved with it ?. For an hour I believed it was humorous, but it became goofy. There is fun in some scenes, but Wayne seemed rightly unconvinced about the plot, and the show reminds of one of the 'Magnificent Seven' sequels, with almost the same _gung ho given as zest ?. So the new way of making westerns became a license to silliness, with Hawks as a saboteur of the genre ?. 'Rio Lobo' isn't about anything, comradeship or even revenge, the storyline turns out to be embarrassingly clumsy, and the early discarding of the idyll of Wayne's sidekick with the medicine show girl was a mistake ?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all those critics who believe John Wayne can't act, the movie legend entertains a line of dialog that's written at his own expense. When the dentist, Dr. Ivor Jones (David Huddleston) purposely causes Cord McNally (Wayne) to yell out in pain using one of his instruments, Jones says to him - "Well if you'd been a good enough actor, I wouldn't have used it!" To his credit, Wayne actually looked stunned when he heard that.Well, like a handful of other Western fans here, I was pretty sure I saw this picture before when it was called "Rio Bravo" and "El Dorado". No drunken sheriff this time around though, so you had to deal with Tarzan actor Mike Henry as the bad guy lawman under the thumb of Rio Lobo town boss Ketcham. I guess I've seen Victor French in too many episodes of 'Highway to Heaven' to picture him as an outlaw, but he did look leaner and meaner here.The head scratcher for me in the picture was the presence of Mexican actor Jorge Rivero; maybe the idea here was to give him a push in American films but I had to wonder why they couldn't have come up with a more recognizable name to complement Wayne in the picture. Rivero, along with the rest of the 'younger' cast didn't really help the story once the movie got under way. Ricky Nelson could at least sing when there was a lull in the action.But the train hijacking was a pretty clever affair, not ever having seen the old greased tracks/bag o' hornets trick before. The other interesting point for me was Colonel McNally's sense of justice in seeking out the Yankee traitor. For him, battling it out with Cordona (Rivero) and Tuscarora (Christopher Mitchum) fell under principles of warfare, but Ketcham's role in supplying information to the Rebs was an act of treason. You know the Duke couldn't stand for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wayne and Hawks Team Up for The Last Time for Good Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legendary producer &amp; director Howard Hawks didn't care for his final film "Rio Lobo." Editor John Woodcock remembers Hawks advising him to whittle down scenes that didn't live up to the director's high expectations. Reportedly, Hawks enjoyed the American Civil War prologue, but his feud with lead actress Jennifer O'Neil and her appallingly callow performance as the heroine marred later scenes, such that Hawks eventually wrote her out of the finale altogether and gave Sherry Lansing the privilege of killing the villain. Indeed, "Rio Lobo" isn't the greatest western. Nevertheless, with its comic byplay among the principals, Jerry Goldsmith's evocative music, and his scenes of violence, Hawks' last collaboration with John Wayne is still a lot of fun. "Rio Lobo" opens with an entertaining and inventive prologue about a Civil War gold robbery. Confederate soldiers grease the railroad tracks that a Union train transporting a shipment of gold is traveling on and then hurl a hornet's nest into the caboose where the troops stand guard over the strongbox. Between the hornets and the Confederate gunfire, the Union soldiers are either shot or bail out as the Confederates release the caboose from the rest of the train. Just to make sure that the locomotive cannot follow them, the Southerners blow of the engine's steam. Talk about a slick piece of work. The rebels smoke the hornets out caboose and halt the runaway vehicle with heavy ropes stretched across the tracks, the same way the Navy use to hang a net across their carrier decks to stop careening jets. Colonel Cord McNally (John Wayne) and his men ride to the scene of the robbery, and McNally finds one of most dependable officers, Lieutenant Ned Forsythe (Peter Jason of "They Live"), lying in a field with his neck broken. McNally and his men split up as they trail the rebels into the woods. The rebels single out McNally and take him prisoner, among the Confederates are Capt. Pierre Cordona aka Frenchy (Jorge Rivero of "Soldier Blue") and Sgt. Tuscarora Phillips (Robert Mitchum's son Christopher of "Big Jake"), who are both pretty handy with this six-shooters. Eventually, McNally outfoxes them and leads them into Union territory. He offers to release them if they divulge the identity of the traitor who has been giving them insider information about the gold shipments. Cordona and Phillips refuse and serve their time out in a prison camp.After the war ends, McNally visits Cordona and Tuscarora as they are discharged and buys them some drinks. The colonel still wants to know who sold him out because he refuses to tolerate treason. When Tuscarora asks him why he doesn't bear a grudge against them, he reminds them that what they did constituted an act of war. McNally gives them some money to supplement the two dollars that Union authorities have given them so they are head west. Cordona and Tuscarora agree to alert McNally when they have any useful information. The time between the prison scene and the subsequent scene in the Texas town of Blackthorne is compressed, and McNally shows up in civilian garb in response to Cordona's summons. No sooner does McNally show up than trouble breaks out because a bunch of Rio Lobo deputies, operating out of their jurisdiction, try to arrest a willowy girl, Shasta (Jennifer O'Neil of "Class of '42) for questioning in connection with a snake oil medicine show she was running. Blackthorne Sheriff Pat Cronin (veteran character actor Bill Williams of "Son of Paleface") tries to intervene, but the Rio Lobo thugs get the drop on him. One of the villains is none other than journalist George Plimpton in a cameo. Shasta pulls a derringer out of her purse under the table and fires through it. She wounds villainous Deputy Whitey (Robert Donner of "High Plains Drifter") while McNally disarms the gunman with a rifle (Plimpton) who stands behind him. Condona appears half-dressed at the top of the stair in the saloon/hotel and helps gun down the opposition. Cordona explains that the man they think sold them the information about McNally's gold trains is a wealthy rancher in Rio Lobo called Ketchum. Veteran heavy Victor French of "Charro!" is the slimy villain who is forcing everybody to sell their land at rock bottom prices and has the notoriously corrupt sheriff, Blue Tom Hendricks (Mike Henry of "Smokey and the Bandit") on his payroll. Hendricks' chief deputy is played by future "Dallas" patriarch Jim Davis. Shasta guides Cordona and McNally to Rio Lobo and they arrive under cover of darkness. The next day McNally watches as couple of Blue Tom's deputies give Tuscarora a beating, charge him with stealing his own horses, and lock him up. McNally, Shasta, and Cordona visit Tuscarora's father's ranch where Blue Tom men have besieged old man Phillips. Our heroes and heroine shoot their way into Phillips' ranch and convince him to accompany them to Ketchum's ranch. They kidnap Ketchum after busting heads and shoot their way into Blue Tom's jail to free Tuscarora. Meanwhile, Cordona heads off to fetch the U.S. Calvary, but the villains capture him and engineer an exchange, Cordona for Ketchum.Leigh Brackett, who co-wrote "Rio Bravo" and "El Dorado," rewrote Burton Wohl's script, and reconfigured several scenes from the aforementioned movies to accommodate "Rio Lobo." Instead of the heroes slinging dynamite as they did against the villains in "Rio Bravo," the villains get to sling dynamite at the heroes. Moreover, "Rio Lobo" doesn't dawdle and never wears out its welcome. As abysmal as Jennifer O'Neil's performance is, the cast seems to work together quite jovially and the dialogue?nothing memorable?flows with a rhythm. Hawks ribs John Wayne's character with his increased girth and age and the girls ridicule Jorge Rivero's romantic Frenchman without mercy. Let's not forget Jack Elam as the cantankerous Mr. Phillips who chews the scenery with vigor as much as he loves to shred anybody and everybody with his double-barreled shotgun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While hardly the most auspicious of swan songs, Hawks&#x2019; underrated final film sees a reprise of some of his favorite themes &#x2013; including the siege/hostage exchange situation from RIO BRAVO (1959), a Western he had already partially remade as EL DORADO (1966); incidentally, John Wayne starred in all three titles.It opens with an elaborate gold shipment robbery from a moving train by Confederate soldiers; Wayne is a Unionist Colonel who goes after the culprits but, the war over, befriends &#x2018;enemies&#x2019; Jorge Rivero and Chris Mitchum when they reveal the identity of a couple of Yankee traitors &#x2013; one is a deputy sheriff and the other an unscrupulous landowner (Victor French). The film shares its partnership-between-Union-and-Confederate-soldiers angle with Wayne&#x2019;s earlier Western THE UNDEFEATED (1969) &#x2013; but, Hawks being Hawks, it&#x2019;s presented here in a far more complex (and rewarding) manner.As is usual for the director, a spirited female protagonist is thrown into the fray &#x2013; in this case, Jennifer O&#x2019;Neill as a traveling-show performer who falls foul of French and his dastardly sheriff (Mike Henry); of course, she becomes romantically involved with Rivero &#x2013; a situation Wayne observes with bemusement. Jack Elam is a delight as Mitchum&#x2019;s trigger-happy coot of a foster parent, making him an ideal replacement for the Walter Brennan of RIO BRAVO. The film also features an unusually wistful score for a genre effort courtesy of Jerry Goldsmith.All things considered, however, RIO LOBO still emerges as the least of the loose Wayne/Hawks Western trilogy: this is chiefly due to severe undercasting when compared to the earlier efforts &#x2013; with, say, Rivero being no match for James Caan from EL DORADO. Though a lot of exposition is necessary for the various plot threads to fall into place, the film (co-scripted by Hawks regular Leigh Brackett) provides plenty of action throughout its almost 2-hour length. The climax is exciting and well-staged, and includes the revenge on Henry by a young girl he has viciously scarred for life (played by Sherry Lansing, future head of the Fox and Paramount studios and currently Mrs. William Friedkin) &#x2013; which, however, calls for O&#x2019;Neill to be virtually absent from these final stages and the film to end abruptly (albeit on a running joke involving Wayne)! Unfortunately, too, the DivX copy I watched proved rather hazy and suffered from occasional compression artifacts.</fullReview>

The dialog left a lot to be desired, but it had some interesting characters.Besides Wayne, who was a Yankee Colonel who was looking for two traitors (Victor French &amp; Robert Donner) after the war, there was Jorge Rivero and Robert Mitchum's son Christopher, who both fought on the Confederate side and who helped Wayne find the traitors after the war. Jack Elam was there and also George Plimpton, who played in many movies like Good Will Hunting and Reds, and who wrote "Infamous." Jennifer O'Neill, Susana Dosamantes, and Sherry Lansing all added beauty to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painful to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even being a big John Wayne fan, it is still almost impossible to watch this film without twitching in agony. Jennifer O'Neill puts in the most memorable performance of the entire crew, unfortunately. She single-handedly wrecks the believability of the lesser experienced performers, and even the great Duke himself is hard pressed to bring her scenes up to marginal acceptability. Once one is forcibly ejected from the realm of suspended disbelief,which happens very early in the movie thanks to Jennifer O'Neill (reminicent of Mark Spitz' earliest efforts), every little acting flaw in the rest of the movie is magnified, in spite of the fact that most of them would otherwise be unnoticeable. Jack Elam does a great performance, as well as several of the other actors, but to no avail. What a shame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is No "Rio Bravo,' Folks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering this is Howard Hawks-directed film and John Wayne is the star, this was a huge disappointment. This movie stunk; there is no other way to put it. It had terrible acting and terrible dialog. Wayne wasn't bad but other two leads - Jorge Rivero and Jennifer O'Neill - were absolutely horrible. The supporting cast, in general, is the worst I have ever seen in a John Wayne film. As one reviewer put it, "This is painful to watch." Very true.The dialog was straight out of a Class B-type sci-fi or horror film of the 1950s. If you saw Rio Bravo and thought, as I did, this would be of similar caliber, well, think again. Don't waste your money renting this clunker, yet another from 1970, perhaps the worst year in film history.</fullReview>

Jennifer O'Neil with her feminine looking pistol, which she fires before she faints (modern gals, take note-very ladylike indeed.) Sort of like the tired orders thrown out by Sigourney Weaver in Alien seem fresher coming from a woman and the stoner jokes in the Harold &amp; Kumar movies are funnier than they would be if they came from a white/blonde "surfer dudes". 7 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fine "Rio Western" from Hawks-Wayne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After so many years I finally sat and watched "Rio Lobo", and to my surprise it was an enjoyable western. Somehow this is the last installment of an unofficial "Rio trilogy" by Howard Hawks (it makes a little more sense to a Spanish speaking person), started with "Red River" (in Spanish, "Río Rojo"), and followed by "Rio Bravo". "Rio Lobo" is the weakest of the trio, both director and star (John Wayne) were past their primes, so it is not a surprise that they took it lightly and delivered an action comedy, in which a knock on the head is enough to put the enemy to sleep. By this time Italian westerns were preferred, and the best American genre examples were of the revisionist type, like "Ride the High Country", "The Wild Bunch", "McCabe and Mrs. Miller", or "Solder Blue", so I guess this one was received back then as old fashioned. But everybody seems to be enjoying the action; all the guys ?in the best Hawksian tradition? do a good job, the women are active and aggressive, the romance between Jorge Rivero and Jennifer O'Neill is played for fun, and the music by Jerry Goldsmith is very good. Two examples of how times have changed: although both actors' names appear above the title in the opening credits, the size of Mexican actor Rivero's name is a third of Wayne's, while today credits are done in an almost equal fashion; and a key Mexican woman called Amelita is played by an actress that would seem more appropriate as an European member of emperor Maximilian I's court in Mexico (Sherry Lansing, who would become chief executive officer at Paramount and president of 20th Century-Fox).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, who cares if it's all the same? This isn't a movie, it's a good time and it feels. Not so much as in Rio Bravo or, even better, El Dorado but still, it's there and the heist in the beginning is rather well carried through, in spite of all the nonsense.Just the stubbornness of doing the same film for the third time with almost the same locations is so downright disrespectful that it deserves extra praise just that. Who does he think that he is, Howard Hawks? He doesn't care and cares even less than a flying fart what you think of him. Well if that isn't charming, what is? What I'm really saying with this review is that Howard Hawks shows us how little a story really means and how many different things can be said without changing the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good but sort of interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was made in 1970 and is apparently the last Howard Hawks western. By this time, a number of "Italian" westerns had been released and made a lot of money. Watching this is sort of like watching one of those Italian westerns, the acting isn't as good as many of them (except for for the older actors), but the dialogue and the plot seem very similar, sort of foreign if you will. Some of the scenes have an "Italian" feel to them as if Hawks or the screenwriters were trying to imitate those films. While this is the third version of the basic story that Hawks and Wayne had made, it would be interesting to see it done one more time with an even stronger "Italian" slant -acting, editing, music, and direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My least favorite John Wayne film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I'm in an exceptionally foul mood today, but after I bought this DVD, and saw the first half hour, I was reminded of why I didn't like this film the first time I saw it.Pic starts off strong with some convincing and innovative action, that itself is quite spectacular, but the supporting cast and sexual tension amongst thereof is a yawner, and will anger the most ardent Wayne fans. Me included.Model's turned actresses deserve a shot at acting just like anyone else; through auditions. How these pretty faces got past reciting their sides for Hawks is no mystery. They're attractive. Wayne fans are split and/or at odds with his pro-Vietnam war flick "The Green Barets", so Wayne goes back to doing Westerns, and Hawks probably obliged with Wayne's faltering rep by casting a couple of honeys for the film.Note that no other big names were in this film. No surprise. We're left with a bunch of flat toned supporting cast (save maybe Ed Asner), and unbelievable gunfight scenes (even for a John Wayne western).The only redeeming quality of this film, other than Wayne himself, is the fact that it was respectably shot. Not well shot, but passable for a pro-grade feature.Me, personally I think this film is a bust. There should have been more action at the end in the tradition of "War Wagon" or maybe even the calming tones of "El Dorado". "True Grit" had a pretty spectacular finish too, as did its sequel. But this film?I don't know. Maybe they figured the genre was wearing thin for a lot of people. The Western was transforming with the nation back then. I know, I was there and remember it. But to create something like this with women who can't act? And an unsympathetic Duke who isn't outraged when a woman gets cut or beaten? Huh?Like I said, maybe I'm just sore and angry with a lot of other things in my life, but this film brought back all the memories of why I quit watching John Wayne films (not that he did a whole lot after this flick).I salute the Duke, and always will, but not this movie. It's more TV movie of the week material than a solid theatrical release.Watch at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even a bad John Wayne film is not usually that bad, but at the end of a long dry season for Wayne, who was already beginning to have health problems, and directed by an already dying director, Rio Lobo just did not go anywhere. The plot, a thinly disguised rewrite of Rio Bravo, had been done twice already and better the other two times. If not for the appearance of Jack Elam (who essentially replayed the Walter Brennan character from the earlier film) this film would be truly dismal. (In a trivial side note: around this same time Elam and Brennan were together in the comedy western "Support Your Local Sheriff" which was a broad spoof of these John Wanye movies.) Still it is not totally bad. And the opening moments of the film were refreshing. Even the music track for this film was poor by usual western standards. Give this a miss and watch "El Dorado" instead. Or watch the wallpaper peel in your living room.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and I did not dislike Rio Lobo but the number of flaws are to big to not notice. Wayne is doing what he was supposed to do and no more, ill supported by not so great script and dialogs, bad casting for supporting characters - except for Jack Elam who very quickly grows into character as the grumpy ol' sidekick with a passion for booze and shotguns - and the story being just a tad too much to be believable. The behavioral patterns of almost every character is too Hollywood and predictable and made to fit into the movie - if Wayne needs a guy to run to left to be able to shoot him, the guy runs to the left ... even if eternal happiness and long life is waiting to the right. The biggest flaw thought being the tone of the movie caught somewhere between funny (wanna-be) and very dramatic and not catching either. On the good side is no surprises, You don't really miss much if You keep the movie running while You're making coffee, Elam is great and heck yeah I got a soft spot for the Duke and even on a bad day he still looks and plays the part.</fullReview>

In some cases the acting(particularly Jorge Rivera and Jennifer O'Neill) is a little weak, but that hardly detracts from the overall effect. Mike Henry, a former Tarzan, is a revelation here. As the smarmy, soulless sheriff he easily holds his own against Wayne in their too-few scenes together. When he gets his deserved comeuppance at the end you really do want to cheer.

		<fullReview>In the Civil War, the Yankee Colonel Cord McNally (John Wayne) captures two Confederate soldiers, Capt. Pierre Cordona (Jorge Rivero) and Sgt. Tuscarora Phillips (Christopher Miitchum) who are stealing the gold from the army payrolls with their troop and the support of two traitors. The prisoners do not reveal the identity of the betrayers. After the Civil War, McNally gets close to them trying to know the names of the traitors, who caused the death of an old friend of him in the daring robbery of a train, but Cordona and Tuscarora do not know their names, but they promise to inform him about any news. Sometime later, Cordona calls McNally to the corrupt city of Rio Lobo, where the two betrayers practically owned the city, and were jeopardizing Tuscarora, trying to force him to sell his ranch to Ketcham (Victor French), the "owner" of the town. "Rio Lobo" is a good entertainment, but it is not a classic or an outstanding western. John Waybe is sixty-years old, fat, and seems to be too old for his role. There are at least three beautiful actresses in the cast, but fortunately there is no romance of him with them. The sweet and gorgeous "carioca" (person born in Rio de Janeiro) Jennifer O'Neill, from "Summer of 42", is a great attraction in this movie with her ability of riding horses and the beauty of her twenty-two years old. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Rio Lobo"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Duke &amp; Hawkes finale collaboration, one to remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne and Howard Hawkes made several films together spanning nearly four decades. Rio Lobo was the grand finale late in the storied careers of these two legendary Hollywood icons. By 1970 the Western genre was starting to fade from popularity, except for the few remaining John Wayne and Clint Eastwood vehicles. Rio Lobo was a throwback to the good .vs the bad of earlier Western's and went against the grain of the "anti-hero" types that clearly began to be prevalent throughout the 1960s. The plot of this film was certainly something ahead of its time with Union army personnel committing treasonous atrocities that seamed to be more in line with the later spy scandals of selling US secrets to the Russians late in the cold war. Of interest to some will be seeing a 25 year old Sherry Lansing who would later go on to become one of the first female top ranking studio executives (First at Fox and later at Paramount), be the woman who took out the worst of the bad guys, a role normally reserved for the Duke. The MPAA Classification and Ratings Administration however needs to seriously think about re-symboling this film from its current G rating to a PG. It is much to violent, and the scene with Amelita (Sherry Lansing) with her blouse off covering her bare breasts with her arms talking quite sensually with Pierre Cardona (Jorge Rivero) is clearly beyond what a G rating is supposed to mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undervalued swansong for Hawks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great Howard Hawks' final film,RIO LOBO,starring John Wayne, continues to divide critical opinion to this day;praised as an enjoyable,action filled coda to a distinguished directorial career,or derided a sluggish,trite and derivative rehash of far better previous works.It is actually a mixture of both,though fortunately it's positive traits do seem to outnumber the negatives,and although one would've liked to have seen Hawks bow out of film-making on a much more confident register,it is in no way an embarrassment and provides decent entertainment.As has been already noted,the plot is homogeneous with Hawks' superior previous westerns RIO BRAVO and EL DORADO,although not as overwhelmingly so;the film's opening half hour features incidents from the latter days of the American civil war,which admittedly has some good action but doesn't seem entirely relevant.Thereafter,it follows the thread of the above mentioned,though with not as much detail or characterisation.RIO LOBO does get bogged down with some dull expository dialogue,and some weak,ineffectual performances from younger members of the cast (Jorge Rivero,Jennifer O'Neill,Chris Mitchum).However,despite his noticeable paunch,Wayne is still a credible action lead though he looks awkward in some of the action scenes.Other members of the support cast,such as David Huddleston,Bill Williams,Jim Davis and Hank Worden also give much needed reliability,and Jack Elam gives the film's best performance,reprising the Walter Brennan role as a rascally,roistering,half-crazy rancher.What ultimately saves the film is it's sense of humour.Wayne,Elam and Huddleston handle the comic relief with aplomb,and Yakima Canutt handles the action,some of it surprisingly vicious,fairly efficiently.The villains involved (Victor French,Mike Henry) are adequate but are given rather superficial characterisations,and nominal female lead Ms O'Neill virtually vanishes in the last few reels,perhaps because of her limited thespian abilities.After being facially scarred by the sadistic Henry,Sherry Lansing turns up for revenge in the last moments;her average but by no means poor performance was her last in films before she famously became a movie studio boss.RIO LOBO is no classic,and pales beside EL DORADO and particularly RIO BRAVO,but despite the advancing ages of the principals (Hawks and Wayne),the two icons can still hold the attention even when they are not at their creative apex.RATING:6 and a half out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love John Wayne movies and think highly of Hawkes as a director. So when I saw this I could not believe how bad it was. The acting by most of the characters was reminiscent of a bad junior high production. The only thing I could figure is that the studio was trying to feature Jennifer O'Neal and "Frency" in some sort of vehicle. It's also slow and predictable. It's painful to watch the Duke deliver and have to be part of such a bad film. He and a couple of bit players, the denist and side kick of Frency, were the only ones who seemed to understand what acting is. This movie makes the "Conquerer" look like a classic. Even the villains were after thoughts. Those of you who have rated this a 6+ ,I challenge you to watch it again and don't be so loyal to the Duke. He did plenty of stuff that was great. She wore a yellow ribbon, the searchers, Fort Apache, The Quiet Man, etc. Avoid this film, except to remind yourself that great actors and directors make bad films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . (if that Shamu was wearing elevator shoes), says a Rebel soldier capturing John Wayne and struggling to lift the unconscious icon early in RIO LOBO. I remember seeing a TV miniseries about England's King Henry VIII, which showed how the geriatric monarch had to be winched up via a tripod hoist to attain a mounted horseback status in his declining fatso years. It's easy to picture a similar apparatus being commissioned for "Il Duce" as he insisted upon abusing horses and making Westerns well into his twilight years. Most NASCAR fans watch their "sport" primarily for the wrecks, and these people's grandparents probably flocked to the theaters for a similar reason in the mid-1900s, not realizing that Wayne's stumbles (whether from the saddle or as a pedestrian) would be edited out of his pictures through Hollywood trickery. The chicks in RIO LOBO treat this one-time singing cowboy like an old Saint Bernard, spooning with him in their long johns merely for nighttime warmth. Though THE LION IN WINTER was barely a blood relation to Henry VIII, Wayne--nicknamed after his childhood dog--proves to be more of an ordinary canine than a regal feline here in RIO LOBO, as in "Come out and see how Westerns have really gone to the dogs!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obvious Scene Mistakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a very obvious mistake shown about one quarter the way into the film. It is one of those kinds of mistakes where props disappear in one scene and then reappear in the next. It happens in the scenes where John Wayne's character is leading the Confederate troops North into trouble to try to capture the two men he wants to question. Sergant Tuscarora ties John's hands as they prepare to leave the cave but when the column stops as Corporal Bide indicates to Captain Cordona that they are heading North look closely at John's hands as he reins his horse back and sideways. He keeps his left hand on the reins a little distance off to the side and puts his right hand on his hip. He wouldn't be able to put his hands apart that far like that if his hands were tied and you can easily see that there is absolutely no rope visible at all. His hands are completely free. But then when they start talking, ride off again,and later when they stop near the Union soldiers camp you can easily see that John's hands are retied all three times and only then does Tuscarora cut him lose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's the real stuff!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, this is one of the greatest Westerns of the '70s. And with the kind of clout it has, it couldn't possibly miss.Hawks' direction, Brackett and Wohl's script, Goldsmith's score and even the legendary Yakima Canutt as second unit director all do their parts to make this one of the brightest and snappiest tales from the Old West ever.Oh yeah, and the Duke's in it, too. Comfortable as ever in a genre he basically dominates anyway, John Wayne (the great "re-actor") makes every word he says and every action he takes as stalwart and as forceful as if he were taking to the screen for the first time.Much has been made of how weak the younger actors are, but considering the circumstances, they do well for themselves (even a young Lansing, who would go on to bigger and better things beyond the camera). The liveliest performance, though, is saved for good old Jack Elam, as looney as ever, and handy with a shotgun as well as mouth harp. He also has the best line: "Don't mind if I shoot anyway, it makes me feel better."You'll no doubt recognize a lot of faces in this film, and probably be surprised to see them there (yes, THAT George Plimpton) but in a film this big and this good, it looks like everyone wanted to get into the act.And through it all, Wayne swaggers and shoots and helps save the Western way of life. You have to admit, there ain't nothing like the "Rio" thing!Ten stars. Check out "Rio Lobo" but just because The Duke looks at ease here, don't call him "comfortable".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a western favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the last Hawks movie. It is western adventure at its best. There's action, fun, gunpowder, a good score, women, horses and a tough plot about loyalty and betrayal. One of my all time western favorites.</fullReview>
