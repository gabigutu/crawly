		<shortDescription>A criminally underrated comedy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why this simply marvelous comedy is not hailed as a screwball classic standing shoulder to shoulder with "It Happened One Night," "The Awful Truth," and "My Man Godfrey," and just under "Bringing Up Baby," is utterly beyond me. Claudette Colbert sparkles in the role of an American golddigger in Paris, Don Ameche is a charming romantic lead, Mary Astor is a delightfully bitchy rival, and John Barrymore is spectacular in one of the funniest performances I have ever seen on celluloid. As others have stated, it is astonishing that he read his lines off cue cards. Anyway, everything in this film works perfectly together: the acting, the direction, the crackling writing, and the zany plot which I will not go into now, but which is absolutely ideal for a screwball. It is also refreshingly politically incorrect, and while feminists might flinch at one or two scenes, that should not prevent anyone from enjoying "Midnight," which is really one of the best comedies of all time. An enthusiastic and unequivocal 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Break out the night vision goggles, the pick-axe, and the compass to find this one if you haven't seen it. I caught it at the MOMA cinema in the old museum basement and laughed so hard I was in tears -- and so were the hundred+ people around me. Monty Woolley and Hedda Hopper are a stitch to watch -- but this is definitely Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche's movie. Colbert spends the first 15 minutes of the movie cold, wet, and hungry -- and Ameche (her knight in shining Taxicab) thoroughly enjoys her predicament. The volley of screwball slap-lines goes on for another hour before the shoe finally fits (as we knew it always would.) The best grins are from Ameche's smug insanity -- and a shaving mug fully loaded.Best of all, the dazzling innocence of the comedy writing from Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett is so light and politically incorrect that you can almost smell "Some Like It Hot" on the distant horizon. There is no meanness or cynicism in MIDNIGHT. Just a good story, good laughs, and a cast full of people you want to meet again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review RE: Cinderella</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant wit and clever exposition abound in the screenplays of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, and are nowhere more plentiful than in the Cinderella inspired, MIDNIGHT (1938). This often overlooked charmer was the first hit in their long and immensely successful collaboration that ended in 1950 with their Academy Award winning SUNSET BOULEVARD. Among their many other screenplays are such milestones as NINOTCHKA, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, THE LOST WEEKEND, another Academy Award winner, and BALL OF FIRE, another flirtation with fairy tales, wherein seven eccentric professors protect a far from innocent Snow White, Barbara Stanwyck.In MIDNIGHT, Claudette Colbert, a down-on-her-luck, but street-smart chorus girl, believes wealth, not love, guarantees happiness. (Brackett and Wilder definitely liked tough gals.) Though attracted to smitten taxi driver, Don Ameche, she rejects his entreaties. Fleeing from him, she meets John Barrymore who convinces her to help end the affair between his chic wife, Mary Astor, and playboy Frances Lederer. To show Astor that her lover is only after money, the wealthy Barrymore, like a fairy godfather, makes Colbert appear as an alluring, even wealthier prey: a Baroness. The wicked sisters are recast in the form of the unfaithful wife, and her friend Rex O'Malley-obviously a fairy of another kind. Barrymore's plan works, and Lederer's attention begins to drift toward Colbert. Angered, Astor enlists O'Malley's aid in finding a way to shatter her lover's idealization of Colbert. Believing they've discovered the truth, the 'girls' get ready to expose Colbert as a phony. At a grand ball, Colbert (looking every inch a Baroness in her very Cinderella-ish gown) expects the worse. However, the wicked plans are foiled when Ameche appears and, going along with the subterfuge, verifies her identity by claiming to be her husband: the Baron. Now, with the entire cast assembled, the disentanglement begins and leads to the fairy tale ending, but without a stroke-of-midnight fall from grace. Instead, the dénouement is a ride of hilarious high style farce involving more deception, misunderstandings, accusations of insanity, and finally a court trial, presided over by a befuddled Monty Woolly; this elaborate finale provides a lot more fun than a simple coach to pumpkin routine would have allowed. The entire cast performs flawlessly, but Astor and O'Malley (rumored to have been the lover of director Leisen) deserve special mention. As the antagonist, Astor mixes vulnerability with comic bitchiness so well; we never dislike her, and cheer her reconciliation with Barrymore. The number of O'Malley's appearances in film is woefully small, as is the size of the roles; he would more often qualify as a bit-player than a character actor. That's too bad, because his appealing friend-of-the-family homosexual in MIDNIGHT has none of the acrimony or overplaying found in so many of the typical queer-types of the period.Production values are high. Hans Drier and Robert Usher's art direction and A. E. Freudeman's set décor are about as good as it gets. Frederick Hollander, who later composed the scores for Wilder's A FOREIGN AFFAIR and SABRINA, is in top romantic form for MIDNIGHT. ~ Ed LaMance ~ New York City</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sophisticated comedy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although languishing in obscurity in comparison to other great films of 1939, Midnight is a classic that deserves to be ranked among the best comedies. In this sophisticated twist on the Cinderella story, a penniless showgirl (the incomparable Claudette Colbert) passes herself off as a foreign aristocrat to help John Barrymore win back his erring wife from a champagne mogul. If she succeeds in winning this millionaire for herself, she'll have the rich lifestyle--the "tub of butter"--for which she's been scheming, but taxi driver Don Ameche is determined to teach her the age-old lesson that love is better than riches. Not only is the film a delight for fans of Colbert, whose genius for offhand, sophisticated comedy shines here, but viewers are also treated to one of Barrymore's last and funniest performances. Although he is said to have read his lines from cue cards for this film, his performance looks flawless: worldly, cunning, and wildly eccentric. Ameche provides the perfect counterpart for Colbert, holding his own in the dizzying round of deceptions, impersonations, and frivolous lawsuits. This is a sparkling, witty film that should be part of every comedy fan's library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight" is superb in every way - cast, direction, script are all perfection. It's like Mozart's "Marriage of Figaro" in the way its plot adds complication upon complication and just as "Figaro" is a perfect opera, so this is a perfect comedy - witty, sophisticated, warm and laugh-out-loud funny. Don Ameche and Claudette Colbert are ideally cast. This should have featured in the AFI's top 100 comedies and its top 100 films - its the epitome of the golden age of Hollywood comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a wonderful, fun movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite delightful. Surprised it's not better known. Has been called "The first great Brackett and Wilder screenplay." Fantastic costumes too. Billy Wilder was frustrated that the director was more interested in the style and look of the movie (which is stellar) than in his dialogue, which he had to fight from being cut. This is probably one of the first films that made him think about directing his own, so he could have more control. Really great comic performances from John Barrymore, Don Ameche, and Claudette Colbert.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sparkling Gem from Hollywood's Golden Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few films that can be seen often without the viewer tiring of them. Midnight is one of them. It glides effortlessly through the tinsel and magical world of barons and down-on-their heels showgirls without taking a mean shot at anyone. Claudette Colbert shows that she lost none of her "It Happened One Night" edginess, and Don Ameche gives the performance of his career as the romantic cab driver who sees himself as worthy to steal Colbert away from her rich suitor. John Barrymore may have been in decline at this point in his career-----but this is his last great effort at creating a truly endearing comic character. He does so splendidly. Mary Astor combines beauty and bitchiness in a memorable role. And what is there to say about Rex O'Malley as her gay pal in all this business? It is a shame that he is virtually unknown today, and didn't get many opportunities to show what a fine comic actor he was.Midnight deserves a much wider audience than it now has. Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett have written wonderful comic dialog that continues to charm and amuse today's viewers. And it is without doubt Mitchell Leisen's masterpiece.This is THE romantic comedy to see with someone you love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best smart-ass film of the 1930's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MIDNIGHT, too often overlooked in the shambles of what has been called the greatest year for movies, 1939, because audiences, accustomed to "screwball comedies" weren't quite ready for this smart-ass comedy of manners scripted by Wilder &amp; Brackett. Claudette Colbert, arriving in Paris dressed only in a gold lame evening gown with matching purse, but without any money or connections, shows how to survive without surrendering her virtue and finds both love and riches. Don Ameche, lethally handsome in beautiful B&amp;W shows he can wear a dinner jacket as well as Cary Grant, or Gary Cooper or Fred Astaire. This film is almost as good as the best Preston Sturges comedies and deserves to be seen by a contemporary audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A night at the Ritz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight" was one of the best pictures released in 1939. This delightful comedy was directed by Mitchell Leisen, based on a screen play by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. One can see the influence of Wilder in the way the story is presented. Mitchell Leisen had a keen eye in the styles of his times, being an art director, as well as a costume designer, as he shows in the film.Claudette Colbert, one of the most accomplished comediennes of her time, shows why her presence in any project was an asset for the director wanting to employ her. If one adds the immensely talented Don Ameche to play opposite of Ms. Colbert, then success was almost guaranteed. These two actors are perhaps, the best reason for watching "Midnight'.This screwball comedy of manners will enchant anyone willing to be seduced by its star. It's almost an implausible story, but why ask questions about what we suspect will happen. We just go along and have a great time for an hour and a half watching this movie.John Barrymore makes an appearance, but he seems so out of character, at times, that we realize he must have been doing this picture out of necessity, rather than artistic duty. In fact, he appears to be reading his lines on cue cards. Not one of Mr. Barrymore's best movies.The rest of the cast is excellent. Mary Astor, makes an elegant Helene, the woman deceiving her husband. Francis Lederer cuts quite a figure as the lover, who has a roving eye for whatever he could conquer. Rex O'Malley, Monty Woolley, and Hedda Hopper are also seen.The ultimate triumph for Mr. Leisen seems to be the opulent sets that he and his team have created to give us the feeling we are in the Paris of that time. The women's costumes by Irene reflect the fashions of the sophisticated world where the movie takes place.Watch the film and enjoy one of the best comedies from that period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche really shine in this screwball comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screwball comedy is an art and in '39 Charles Brackett wrote a perfectly wonderful one for CLAUDETTE COLBERT and DON AMECHE called MIDNIGHT and directed by the talented Mitchell Leisen.Claudette is down to her last coin when she stumbles out of a taxi-cab driven by Don Ameche and strolls around Paris in the pouring rain in a gold lame dress, not exactly the picture of a girl down on her luck. But the fun begins when she crashes a party given by a bunch of socialites and has to pretend to be there as a member of high society. She calls herself a Baroness and before long, Ameche has caught up with her and goes along with her impersonation, calling himself a Baron.Of course, it takes many plot twists and turns for the whole story to come to an end, and by that time there are quite a few laughs provided by Claudette and company. JOHN BARRYMORE is in especially good comic form as a man who wants his wife (MARY ASTOR) to get rid of her lounge lizard boyfriend (FRANCIS LEDERER), who happens to fancy Claudette. REX O'MALLEY has a fey role as a house guest and the cast includes HEDDA HOPPER and MONTY WOOLLEY as an exasperated and befuddled judge.Claudette has her best role since IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT and makes the most of it. She schemes her way in and out of trouble with the disarming charm and ease of an actress who has worn many disguises before.Summing up: A very winning comedy that is a perfect example of screwball at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinderella with an opportunistic streak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the films at Paramount (with EASY MONEY &amp; REMEMBER THE NIGHT) that Mitchell Leisin was criticized by the screenwriters (Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, and Preston Sturgis) for altering the pacing or direction of the screenplays. He didn't. Leisin was never as cynical as either Wilder or Sturgis, and tended to soften the central characters of his comedies by showing them as human beings. This is true with how he handled Wilder and Brackett's "Eve Peabody" (Claudette Colbert), who is a showgirl/gold-digger who lucks out because a wealthy banker George Flammarion (John Barrymore) needs her to help him win back his wife Helene (Mary Astor).MIDNIGHT is the "Cinderella" story. Colbert has come to Paris with nothing but the clothes she has on her. She meets a cab driver (Don Ameche as "Tibor Czerny") who is willing to help stake her until she can find work. But Colbert (although she obviously likes Ameche) is determined to take Paris by storm first, and runs away from him - managing to get into a social event. It is a soirée held by Hedda Hopper (one of her few movie roles), where she keeps annoying the pianist by introducing his piece as a Prelude, when it is an Etude.Barrymore is there with Astor, and with her boy-friend (Francis Lederer as Jacques Picot), as well as Astor's gay confidante Rex O'Malley (as Marcel Renaud). Lederer keeps looking very interested at Colbert (much to Astor's increasing annoyance), and Barrymore notes this. He asks Colbert a few questions, and accepts her answers. Like another Eve in a later film, Colbert does not know enough to keep her comments simple and non-committal. But as the party breaks up, a limousine is there to pick up Colbert and take her to a ritzy hotel suite as Baroness Czerny. After she wanders stunned through the opulent apartments, Barrymore shows up. After pointing out her error about various answers she gave him (you will learn about the oldest subway in Europe), Barrymore explains why he has set her up (and will back her). He wants her to attract Lederer away from Astor, whom Barrymore loves deeply but who is infatuated with the younger man. Colbert agrees, but only because she may end up marrying the wealthy Lederer (his fortune is from an inferior champaign, but Barrymore says that "Everytime his champaign is bought, his fortune bubbles!").Ameche of course is busy looking for Colbert, and eventually finds her. He confronts her at the Flammarion mansion, and claims he is the husband of the "Baroness". This, of course, adds a complication to the plans of Barrymore (who tries to derail Ameche repeatedly). In the end the entire matter has to go to divorce court. Unfortunately it is run by that stickler for law, order, and the French home: Monty Wooley. And how it is resolved I will leave to the viewer to discover.It is a witty little film, due in part to the Wilder and Brackett script, but also the master hand of Leisin in getting performances out of his actors - including John Barrymore in his last good performance in a supporting role. Reportedly Barrymore read his lines from cue cards just off the set (he explained that he would not memorize lines from a Hollywood script - only from a classic play). Still look at his moments of zaniness pretending he is the Czerny's child, or in making little sniping remarks at O'Malley's expense. He still could act quite well at this point. Ameche and Colbert also have good timing, and chemistry together. Colbert even has a moment of humanness (that Leisin added) where she explains her avariciousness is based on seeing how her parents grew to hate each other in their mutually entrapped poverty row marriage. Wilder normally never got points like that into his films, nor did Sturgis.It is a wonderful comedy, and one of the best screwball films of the 1930s. Pity it is not as well known as it should be.</fullReview>

While posing as the Baroness Czerny of Hungary, Tibor Czerny (Ameche), a cab driver,not royalty, pursues the lovely Peabody. It is delightful to see Peabody's constant deceptions grow larger and larger throughout the film until she finally decides the high life isn't really for her.

		<shortDescription>Leisen applies the Lubitsch touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As good as a movie can get. Claudette Colbert is the flapper/gold-digger/chanteuse, (take your pick), who arrives in a very rainy Paris in an evening gown and not much else. She is momentarily rescued from her predicament by a gallant taxi driver, (played gallantly by Don Ameche), with whom she immediately falls in love but from whom she runs as fast as her well-turned-out legs can carry her. She runs straight into the clutches of John Barrymore, (a magnificent comic performance), who saves her bacon, so to speak, if only she will seduce gigolo Francis Lederer who is stealing away Barrymore's wife, the always delectable Mary Astor, and thus save Barrymore's marriage.This is a French farce of the very best kind, although it is written, not by a Feydeau, but by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, and directed with supreme elegance by the under-valued Mitchell Leisen. Colbert is wonderful as the wide-eyed chorine, torn between love and riches, Barrymore displays sublime comic timing and Astor is as sharp as a new pin. It feels and looks like a Lubitsch but I doubt if even Lubitsch could better it.</fullReview>

I could count on two hands the number of films which have genuinely made me laugh out loud, and this is near the top of the list, perhaps even the top, of the list. I first saw it on television many years ago, and I can't remember it ever being shown since - pity. I scoured the net for it and found it on VHS eventually. As others have said, it is right up there with the likes of 'Bringing Up Baby' and 'It Happened One Night' as a sparkling comedy, but the one-liners for me surpass the anything in those films. What a shame it seems to have been forgotten. If, as someone has written, it is to re-made with Reese Witherspoon as Eve Peabody, let's hope it will make people look up this overlooked classic. They really don't make them like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great creative team = oustanding results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The charming and vivacious Claudette Colbert shines brightly in this fast-paced, witty, hilarious farce. Look at these credits: A script by the great team of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder; a supporting cast that includes John Barrymore, Mary Astor, Rex O'Malley, Hedda Hopper and Monty Woolley - all at their best. (Even Don Ameche as the romantic lead, not known as a particularly exciting or interesting actor, holds his own.) Frederick Hollander, famous as the composer of the Marlene Dietrich signature song "Falling in Love Again," contributes incidental music that successfully evokes the Paris that used to be, or at least the Paris of the imagination, even though this movie was shot at Paramount Studios, USA, with liberal use of process shots of the fabled French metropolis. All in the sure hands of Mitchell Leisen who directed his fair share of golden age films which are still watchable in the 21st century.The farcical plot is based on the Cinderella concept - in this case, an out-of-work show girl stranded in Paris is first taken in by a taxi driver who falls in love with her, and then by an older gentleman who plies her with riches for reasons which do not become clear until we've laughed our way through several episodes. The plot overflows with ingenious twists and clever, snappy dialogue. Complications build to a wacky courtroom resolution presided over by Monty Woolley.Anyone who has also seen the 1942 Preston Sturges comedy The Palm Beach Story will wonder if Sturges didn't steal half the idea from Midnight. The parallels are abundant and I highly recommend the Sturges film to anyone who likes Midnight. In the Sturges film, Colbert, on the run from her architect husband (Joel McCrea), impulsively boards a train for Palm Beach, setting in motion a cinematic pandemonium. Mary Astor is again on hand as the daffy, loquacious sister of eccentric millionaire Rudy Vallee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>often hilarious story with some familiar themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Claudette Colbert wanders around Paris broke and in gold lame in "Midnight." She meets a cab driver and, finding herself attracted to him, she takes off. While he's organizing a city-wide cabbie search for her, she's at a private party and winds up at the Ritz as Baroness Czerny - which is his last name, chosen by her in a moment of panic. She is backed in all her lies by John Barrymore, in a wonderfully funny performance, who wants her to woo his wife's boyfriend away from her.There are some familiar themes at work here - one is the suitor for hire and/or opportunity, used (with variations, of course) in "Her Cardboard Lover" and "Palm Beach Story," "Mannequin," and the affable, unambitious man who feels that by having nothing, he has everything, such as in "Magnificent Dope" and "You Can't Take it With You." That's the Ameche character. Knowing she could fall for him sends Colbert running - just as she ran from Joel McCrea in "Palm Beach Story." This hunger for money in some characters (usually women) and loathing of it (usually men) is a strange dichotomy than runs through several post-Depression, pre-war films.The handsome Czech leading man, Francis Lederer, plays Mary Astor's boyfriend who falls for Colbert. In 1929, when he made a film in Germany with Louise Brooks, Lederer couldn't speak a word of English. He lived to be nearly 101 and in his last years, taught at the American National Academy of Performing Arts, which he and his wife founded.The funniest scene to me was a phone conversation between Barrymore and Colbert, in which she pretends she's talking to her sick daughter. But everyone is great in this movie, which is very funny and refreshing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dressed for success, penniless nightclub entertainer Claudette Colbert (as Eve Peabody) arrives in Paris. Looking for both employment and eligible men, Ms. Colbert finds her style cramped by a drenching rainstorm. To stay dry, she accepts a date with handsome taxi-driver Don Ameche (as Tibor Czerny). He invites Colbert to stay over; but, she is after finer digs, and ditches Mr. Ameche at a gas station.Next, Colbert crashes a socialite's party, where she meets wealthy John Barrymore (as George Flammarion). To win back the attentions of wife Mary Astor (as Helen), Mr. Barrymore hires Colbert to romance Ms. Astor's handsome French lover, Francis Lederer (as Jacques Picot). Meanwhile, Ameche summons his taxi-driving pals to find Colbert, with whom he has fallen in love? Wonderfully cast, with Colbert offering her by now typically delightful performance; like several of her other films, "Midnight" is much better than the more celebrated "Academy Award" winner. An obviously inebriated Barrymore is better than none. And, screenplay writers Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder seem to be warming up for "Ninotchka". Probably, this is director Mitchell Leisen's finest work.********* Midnight (3/15/39) Mitchell Leisen ~ Claudette Colbert, Don Ameche, John Barrymore, Mary Astor</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies of this era for me, at least, was "Midnight". I thought it was very smartly done and the casting was terrific. Claudette Colbert is very good in this(one of her best, I think) but the real shining star is Don Ameche. He pulls off an amazing performance of not only looking the part of the humble cabbie but as the posh aristocrat as well. The banter (read: fore-play) of Colbert and Ameche is what really drives this movie. Also a good part for John Barrymore as the rich poor man who really does love his wife. If you're looking for a good "date movie" to rent, you can't miss with this one! Not only will she like it, but you'll enjoy it as well!</fullReview>

Claudette is at her best and the script is witty and way ahead of its time. As Eve, Claudette learns how difficult it is to deceive and keep the web of make believe going. Her comic timing is impeccable. Loved Rex O'Malley in a small but "out" part. Mary Astor, as usual, has that sweet venomous second fiddle role down pat. Barrymore, apparently reading his lines, does very well. He is the only one in heavy makeup.

		<fullReview>This movie is a gem -- one of my favorites.It shows you everything that the golden age of Hollywood was all about. Good writing, direction, great performances, strong supporting cast, effective production design. A lot of fun; a light comedy classic.Reminds me a bit of "The Lady Eve," especially in that each has a similar, memorable party scene. A difference, though, is that the Colbert character is more realistically drawn, and the film is a notch less manic (and much more enjoyable for my tastes) than the screwball pace of "The Lady Eve."</fullReview>

Mary Astor and John Barrymore are also great, even though he was a big drunk and refused to memorize his lines and just read them off cue cards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight is a treat at any time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight (1939) is an excellent film that showcases the talents of all of its stars: a very sassy and glamorous Claudette Colbert, a very charming and self-assured Don Ameche, the lovely Mary Astor, a small but perfectly hilarious part by Monty Woolley, and John Barrymore in what is probably my favorite role of his. Midnight is pure romantic comedy. It's not an over-the-top screwball, but it does lean that way particularly at the château. The chemistry between Ameche and Colbert is excellent. Despite her plans to keep away, his determination never wavers, although his methods do.My only disappointment is that it's a few minutes too short. The time flies and it's over in just over 90 minutes. These characters are so much fun to watch, a full 2 hours would have been okay by me. Regardless, I've seen it several times now, and with each viewing it grows on me. I also enjoy noticing the little details that add to the comedy. I highly recommend Midnight to any classic film lover. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** 1930's screwball comedy involving a case of mistaken identity in out of luck and broke American showgirl Eva Peabody,Claudette Colbert, getting stranded in Paris after blowing her entire life savings in Monoco and hooking up with an Hungarian Taxi driver played by handsome Irish/Italian American actor Don Ameche! In fact the very next film that he'd star in would be the one that Ameche would become most identified with where he played Scotsman Alexander Graham Bell in the movie aptly named "The Story of Alexander Graham Bell".Looking for a place to stay and a bed to sleep in Eva runs into Paris taxi driver Tibor Czerny, Don Ameche, who after taking her for a ride, free of charge, and trying to find Eva a job is left out in the rain as she runs out on him and ends up at the party attended by the wealthy and well connected Flamarion's of Versailles. Slipping in unnoticed and without an invitation Eva is rescued by George Flamarion, John Barrymore, when he slips 10,000 francs in her pocketbook to keep Eva from being run out of the party in not having the money she lost playing bridge.George wants to break up his wife Helene's, Mary Astor, affair with Paris gigolo Jacques Picol, Francis Lederer, and sees in Jacques by him not being able to keep his eyes off her Eva being the other woman that would break up his relationship with Helene! It's later when Eva uses the name of Hungarian Baroness Czerny, the name she took from cab driver Tibor, as a front that George rents out a room, or suite, at the ritzy Ritz Hotel in her name to keep the sham, in Eve being of royal blood, going!It's when the stood up Tibor who, after all he did for her, Eve walked out on tracks her down, with the help of his fellow Paris taxi drivers, at the Flammarion château in Versailles that sparks really start to fly in all directions. Outraged in being made a fool of Tibor crashes a party given at the château in Eve's honor by claiming to be her husband the Barron Tibor Von Czerny of Budapest! One of the oldest and continuous royal blood-lines in all of Europe!Great fun to watch with John Barrymore who was reported to be almost dead drunk during the filming of the movie steal every scene he's in even going so far as mimicking the Czerny's three year old doughter back in Budapest who's reportedly bedridden suffering from the measles. As for Eve she gets Tibor off balance in telling everyone at the party that he's slightly insane and has a habit of trying to be a member of the great unwashed masses,like a taxi driver of trash collector, because of the guilt he feels in being a member of the upper crust of society!****SPOILERS**** The final nail in the coffin of Eve con job is when in a fit of ager she attempts to divorce her husband the Barron, really taxi driver Tibor Czerny, who was secretly paid by Geroge to go through with it! Just when both Eva and Tibor were about to agree in getting a divorced they realized that they were in love with each other and in fact not even married thus making a divorce impossible! This had the presiding judge, Monty Woolley, in this whole wacky affair almost swallow his false teeth after both Tibor and Eva agreeing not to divorce each other tell him that their now going down to the Paris city hall to get themselves a marriage license!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wilder and Brackett had one of their earliest successes as screenwriters in this delightful comedy about a broke woman pretending to be an heiress. Colbert excelled at this sort of light comedy and she is perfectly cast here. Ameche is fine as the cabbie who falls in love with her. However, Barrymore, with his arched eyebrows and bemused expression, steals the film as an eccentric millionaire. The scenes at his country estate are hilarious, particularly when he pretends to be Colbert's little son on the phone. Astor is wonderful as Barrymore's philandering wife. It is smoothly directed by Leisen, but it feels more like a Wilder film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Don't forget...every Cinderella has her midnight." And Midnight is one of the best of the screwball comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If "Midnight" as a title seems puzzling, think Cinderella. Except this time our Cinderella is a gold digger with a self-defeating habit of falling for poor taxi drivers. She's also one of the foxiest, funniest and sexiest young ladies in Paris. No staying at home to sweep out the hearth for her. Midnight, released in 1939, was one of the last of the great romantic screwball comedies that Hollywood had learned how to make during the Thirties. Somehow, it was nearly forgotten while others were treasured. With DVD, here's our chance to see again just how good it is, thanks to Claudette Colbert as the ambitious Eve Peabody; Don Ameche as the cab-driving Tibor Czerny; John Barrymore as the rich Georges Flammarion, a somewhat dissipated fairy godfather; Mary Astor as his wife, Helene; and with Mitchell Leisen directing and Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder writing the screenplay. If you're able to watch this movie without smiling, you must have injected too much Botox around your lips. Eve arrives in Paris by train with only the gold lame gown she's wearing and a lonely franc in her purse. She's lost all her money and luggage gambling, hoping to make enough to land a rich daddy. Before long Tibor is driving her around in the rainy night in his taxi while she tries to find a nightclub job singing. No luck. Tibor is obviously smitten, but Eve, who likes him more and more, is determined to get ahead in life. She leaves Tibor putting gas in the taxi and runs off into the rain. She winds up at an exclusive salon filled with wealthy patrons being cultured with classical music. And there she meets the rich Georges Flammarion, whose wife, Helene, is being wooed by the rich Jacques Picot (Francis Lederer). Flammarion, no fool, comes to Eve's assistance when awkward questions are about to be asked, and installs her at the Ritz. He then proposes. Not marriage, but an arrangement where Eve will entice Jacques away from Helene, whom George, it turns out, actually loves. Now we're in elegant mansion country, where there are exquisitely dressed guests doing the conga, where Eve is pretending to be the Baroness Czerny (she had to come up with a name, and Tibor's was handy), where she has Jacques enticed and where suddenly Tibor shows up in white tail and tails pretending to be Baron Czerny, where imaginary children have measles, where there can be a wedding gift of a single roller skate covered with Thousand Island dressing, where mix-ups collide with complications, and where Georges must come to the rescue with flawless double takes. We wind things up in a divorce court with a kiss and an embrace, of course, but only after so many really clever fibs and ingenious set-ups that Brackett and Wilder must have used a chart to keep things clear. Everything works in this sophisticated romantic comedy, and that includes the dialogue by Brackett and Wilder. The movie keeps rushing and fizzing ahead. Colbert dominates but all are at their best (even Ameche, who doesn't come to mind as the first person to cast in a sophisticated comedy). Colbert was just at the cusp of moving into films more suitable to her age (she was 37). In four years she'd be playing the teenage Shirley Temple's mother. She never lost that sexy, clever, resourceful aura of hers, and it's in full force here. To see what I mean, just watch her as Franzi in The Smiling Lieutenant opposite Maurice Chevalier and as Ellie in It Happened One Night. She gives wondrous charm to Eve's ability to come up with plausible alternatives to awkward realities. Barrymore makes a dissipated fairy godfather, but with so much sly charm it's a pleasure to observe his rescues of Eve. Barrymore knows what he's doing, even if by now he had to read his lines from giant cue cards. If you like Hollywood screwball comedies, I think you'll find Midnight is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Midnight" - just perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight" may be the best of the great 30's screwball comedies, and we're talking about "Libeled Lady", "The Awful Truth", "Bringing Up Baby", "Nothing Sacred", "Ninotchka", and "Holiday", among others.What makes it so extraordinarily great? The movie simply doesn't touch ground throughout the proceedings - a bit like a faster-paced Lubitsch concoction. This is much to talk about, but in particular, the Wilder-Brackett script is loaded with so many memorable jabs and rejoinders that one is grateful for the opportunity to rewind the action to relish them. The pacing is just exactly right, with its many high points, particularly at the point of introduction and re-introduction of characters in various states of array or disarray.With Colbert, Ameche, Lederer, and Astor, it's hard to point to stand-outs, but Barrymore's performance is worth more for what he does not say than for his lines (which he supposedly had to read from cue cards) - his mute reactions of curiosity, skepticism, abashment, and astonishment are priceless. The appearance of Monty Woolley near the end of the film couldn't come at a better time, nor could the end of the film itself! If you like films of this type from this period, this is a must - 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, fast screwball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1939 version of "Midnight" does not seem to be related to any of the other "Midnights" made in 1917, 1934, 1982, 1989, 2006. Claudette Colbert is the dolled up Eve Peabody, broke and looking for work in the rain. Along comes ever-so-friendly cab driver Tibor Czerny (Don Ameche), who goes out of this way to drive her around and help her find work. Also in here are John Barrymore, Mary Astor, Hedda Hopper, and Monty Woolley, all biggies in Hollywood. Note the cast list, which includes William Hopper, Hedda's son, as a party guest. Also Joyce Mathews, who was married to Milton Berle (twice !) In usual Billy Wilder style, there are elements of a chase, some moments of serious plot, and a whole lot of silly pratfalls that mostly end in good luck. When Eve sneaks into an evening party, pretending to be someone else, she meets up with Georges Flammarion (Barrymore) , who has a scheme going of his own, and he needs Eve's assistance. Rumor has it Barbara Stanwyck was originally going to star in this, and there are definitely similarities to Lady Eve, which would be released two years after Midnight by Preston Sturgess. Midnight also has a similar plot to The Bride Wore Red from 1937, where Joan Crawford sneaks into a weekend getaway with the uppercrust, but one of her own "friends" wants to save her before its too late. In our story, we keep flashing over to the cabbie Czerny (Ameche) who is still trying to track down Eve.... Who will she end up with, and will she be exposed as the fraud she is ? Fun, fast script, and it keeps the viewer enthralled. Colbert plays Eve just innocent enough to make us want her to succeed, even though she is doing some underhanded things. Fun to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dissenting view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the first half of the film to be a bit stuffy. In fact, I was expecting to give it a negative review. But, once they move on to the estate, it really became quite clever. Don Ameche's charming screen persona is evident here, and Claudette Colbert is her usual vivacious self. But considering this film was made in the magic cinema year of 1939, it seemed rather old world. And perhaps the reason is that it was one of those films making sport of the old moneyed rich. And that is so mid-1930ish.Two things struck me as illogical here. First, the idea that someone as sophisticated as Claudette Colbert's character would we wandering around Europe with not a bit of money in her pocket. Second, John Barrymore was clearly way over the hill in this film; difficult to believe he was once considered a great screen actor; watch his eyes...flashes of silent screen overacting on occasion.Mary Astor is excellent as the philandering wife of John Barrymore. She is probably one of Hollywood's most underrated actress. Francis Lederer, with whom I was not at all familiar, played the butterfly playboy excellently. And Monty Woolley was delightful as the judge in the divorce court.Many consider this to be one of the great screwball comedies. I don't rate it quite that highly. It won't find its way onto my DVD shelf. But I'm glad I watched it, and may do so again. It's definitely worth watching just to see the chemistry between Don Ameche and Claudette Colbert.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinderella With Avarice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Don Ameche borrowed from 20th Century Fox and John Barrymore finished with his contract at MGM, the two of them teamed with Claudette Colbert to make Midnight where Colbert plays a chorus girl stranded in Paris. When Don Ameche finds her and takes her in, she's wearing a newspaper for a hat.She could have all her basic needs met with Ameche who's head over heels for her, but Claudette wants more out of life. Enter John Barrymore who would like to have her masquerade as a baroness, to ward off another goldigger of the male kind in Francis Lederer who has been sniffing around Mary Astor who is Barrymore's wife.Colbert pulls it off beautifully, maybe she'll meet a really rich candidate for a husband. Lederer is sniffing all right to Astor's jealousy, but Ameche is on the scent too. He's going to find that woman who came and went out of his life so quickly. And Barrymore, the sly rogue, is presiding over it all like an indulgent grandpa.When you have a director like Mitchell Leisen and such skilled players in comedy as Ameche and Colbert in the lead, the result can't be anything else, but pure entertainment. Barrymore is also grand in the last part he would have in an A budget film.Down in the supporting cast take careful note of Monty Woolley as a judge, a man well versed in the divorce laws of France and who brooks no nonsense in his court. Best scene in the film is Ameche with the help of several Parisian cab drivers getting the hotel maitre'd to tell where Colbert left for. That has to be seen, no description will do.Unfortunately Midnight is not the kind of screen comedy made any more, so see it when broadcast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most delightful movies i have ever seen Ms. Colbert in. She is so funny,intriguing and smart while at the same time so very sweet. Claudette Colbert always sparkles, and here she is dazzling. Don Ameche is both sexy and silly at the same time and plays the part of Ms. Colbert's love interest with real zest and is very believable given the screw-ball nature of the movie. Furthermore the movie captures the socio-economic texture of 1920's Paris perfectly. We see the haves and those that have not going about their lives in two separate parallel worlds almost oblivious of one another until a strange, wonderful fluke happens. Our heroine, a down on her luck smart-ass expatriate, crosses paths with a hot blooded exiled blue blood with a heart of gold. And then we the audience can sit back and enjoy how these two completely different people from completely different worlds fall head over heels for each other and live happily ever after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is charming and full of whimsy. It brightens the hope of breaking the wall between the rich and the needy. Eve Peabody, a struggling blues singer is given the chance to hang out with the elite, at swanky opera parties and rooms at the Ritz. But there's a catch, she must break up the charming Jaques with her "employer's" wife. Only there is one problem, to do so she has to disguise herself as "the Baroness Czerny", bringing strong suspicion from the wife, because no one has ever heard of her. Also her past comes back to haunt her when her one night love, Tybor Czerny decides he wants her in his life. It is a fun screw ball comedy with literally no slow or boring moments. It is rather a nice thought too, that all your problems could be solved because you're good at flirting. Good clean fun! 9.99/10</fullReview>

Ameche and Colbert had the type of on-screen chemistry you only saw with Taylor and Burton. They made a great pair!

John Barrymore (Georges Flammarion),"Dinner At Eight",'33",plays a husband to Mary Astor (Helene Flammarion),"The Maltese Falcon",'41, and finds out that his wife is fooling around and he stumbles upon a woman down and out from gambling and visiting Paris without a single penny to her name. This down and out woman is Claudette Colbert,(Eve Peabody),"The Egg &amp; I",'43. Georges Flammarion has an agreement worked out between them to make his wife envious. Eve Peabody meets a taxi driver, Don Ameche(Tibor Czerny),"Cocoon",'85 who falls in love with her and searches all over Paris with his other Taxi friends. Mary Astor was having a child during the filming of this story and was covered up with furs or wearing lots of black. Mary was linked romantically with John Barrymore when she was only 18 years of age. If you really love great Classic B&amp;W films, watch and enjoy this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fair Example of the Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A chorus girl (Claudette Colbert), stranded in Paris, is "set up" by a millionaire to break up his wife's affair with another man.According to a Turner Classic Movies introduction by Robert Osborne, the role that eventually went to Claudette Colbert was originally slated for Barbara Stanwyck but scheduling problems prevented her from taking it. Osborne also stated Wilder was unhappy with script changes made by director Leisen, giving him motivation to become a director himself so he would have more creative control.Although I much prefer Stanwyck over Colbert, she does a fine job in this film and I suppose it would be hard to imagine it any other way. She does have something of an innocence about her. It is interesting to hear that this was the film that pushed Wilder from being a writer to a director. His writing is very good, but I daresay his directing is even better and really catapulted comedy to new heights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delicious film from the great comedy era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some lists of screwball comedies include this 1939 film that stars Claudette Colbert, Don Ameche and John Barrymore. I think it's a bit iffy for that category ? it lacks the long strings of crazy antics that define the top comedies considered "screwball." But regardless, this is a gem of a movie and wonderful comedy. I agree with the other reviewers who note the scene-steeling of John Barrymore. He made only four more films after this one before his death. "Midnight" is his last very good or great film. Colbert and Ameche are excellent in their roles as Eve Peabody (aka, the Baroness Czerny) and Tibor Czerny. Mary Astor, Francis Lederer and Rex O'Malley give very good performances in their roles. But the interplay between Barrymore's Georges Flammarion and Colbert's Eve is the stuff that makes for great comedy. I purchased this film for my library and the DVD had a nice introduction that explained the considerable difficulty in the making of the film. It was mostly about conflicts among directors and writers and with some actors. I appreciate and enjoy these inside looks at movie making from time to time. The fact that Barrymore could no longer remember his lines and had to use cue cards makes one appreciate that much more the great talent of this actor in performing his roles. John Barrymore was known for his great ad-libbing in films ? that enhanced his roles of all genres. Of all the stage and screen Barrymores, John is the only one who didn't win major awards. Siblings Lionel and Ethel each won Oscars. His personal life was chaotic and his four marriages each lasted no more than a few years. Drinking took its toll and he died at age 60 from cirrhosis of the liver and pneumonia. According to biographers, Barrymore had a conversion and reverted to his Catholic faith before he died. Barrymore appeared in 65 films. He began in the silent era and continued his fame in sound films. More than half of his films were with sound. He was equally at home in comedy, drama and mysteries. All of his sound films are a treat to watch. He has to be on any list of the best actors of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently, Barbara Stanwyck was supposed to play the lead but a scheduling conflict prevented it. One cannot help but think how she would have played the scenes when Eve Peabody wakes up in the suite and finds all those clothes given to her by John Barrymore's character. Of course, Claudette Colbert is good and brings an air of sophistication to the part, but she does not come across as hard-pressed as Stanwyck probably would have presented the character. Don Ameche plays a taxicab driver and is the prince charming in this picture. He pulls it off, thanks in large part to the easy rapport he shares with Colbert. Another standout, among a group of top-notch performers, is Mary Astor. But the real scene-stealer is Hedda Hopper as the socialite, Stephanie. Monty Woolley commandeers the laughs in the final sequence as a put- upon judge, but I would have preferred seeing a final shot of the lovers as they were married.Colbert and Ameche re-teamed for two more pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films made during the 1930's that have been called a screwball comedy. It is lighthearted and funny guaranteed to keep you in stitches and is suitable for the entire family. On the introduction given by Robert Osborne for the DVD release,he states that John Barrymore refused to learn his lines and read everything off cue cards but the audience was never aware of it. Barrymore also had a habit of stealing every scene he was in. That is the mark of a true professional! Don Ameche and Claudette Colbert make this movie so enjoyable and the acting of John Barrymore,Francis Lederer,Mary Astor,Elaine Barrie,Monty Woolley,and Heda Hopper provides 95 minutes of great entertainment! The movie was filmed by Paramount then later sold to Universal Studios who has it available now on DVD in their Cinema Classics collection.

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Comedies of Manners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The term, "a comedy of manners", is much abused by film and literary critics who often pin this label on bucolic slapstick like The Egg and I (1947) or mismatched romantic formulas like Misleading Lady (1932). The true comedy of manners, like The Philadelphia Story for instance, is set almost exclusively in high society where the foibles of the idle rich who have nothing better to do than play marital games, come under the microscope.As it happens, I'm not a great fan of the comedy of manners. The idle pursuits of the idle rich do not greatly interest me. But there are exceptions ? like this movie and the aforesaid Philadelphia Story ? where the formula is broadened to include major characters like James Stewart's reporter in P.S. or Don Ameche's cab-driver in Midnight.The latter film also has the advantage of Claudette Colbert's lead character who, like Miss Colbert's lead character in the 1942 Palm Beach Story, doesn't really belong ? although she makes a good try (and this fish out of water element serves as the basis for most of the satire and comedy).Most fortunately too, Midnight has a fine supporting cast led by John Barrymore (at his scene-stealing best) and Mary Astor. And right up almost to the end of the movie when Leisen allows Monty Woolley to hog the camera and bring this fast-paced movie to a screeching halt, it's directed at an admirably rapid clip too! You really need to have your ears and eyes fully attuned and your mind clear as a bell to follow the many delightful twists and turns of the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claudette Colbert In Paris- A Novel Idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1939 has always been a magic year for films. I have just viewed this one, &amp; once again this movie proves it over again. Claudette Colbert plays a broke American Woman who comes into Paris &amp; gets into a most interesting situation.First, arriving in Paris, she meets a taxi driver (Don Ameche) who falls for her &amp; she for him. Then she leaves Ameche &amp; happens to wander into a situation where she seduces a playboy who wants to marry her. She goes from being penniless to being a Baroness. Things become quite amazing as she now has a suite at the Ritz Hotel, a chauffeur, &amp; lots of money to spend.This is screwball comedy at its best as the jokes fly throughout the film. Colbert is as good here as in any film. Don Ameche is good, &amp; so is the rest of the cast. Hedda Hopper actually plays a character (Stephanie) in this movie which is rare as she usually plays herself but since the film is set in Paris, I guess they had to give her a role instead. The film even has a classic comedy black out ending. The script has the hand of the great writing of Billy Wilder &amp; is just great.I highly recommend this movie, yet another reason &amp; miracle about that magic year of 1939. This one got no recognition but it is without a doubt another very good film from Hollywoods greatest year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinderella in reverse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A delightful movie which proves that Leisen was as talented a director in melodrama("remember the night",the sublime "hold back the dawn") as he was in a comedy.Claudette Colbert gives a wonderful mischievous performance of a would be noble -she is actually completely broke and a true common woman.Puns,mistakes ,misunderstandings abound and there is a funny line a minute .My favorite scene remains the breakfast when the distinguished guests learn that their "daughter" is seriously ill .The screenplay is so inventive and so hilarious you will not get bored a single minute.The title "midnight" hints at Cinderella ,a fairy tale that spawned a lot of movies;even "remember the night" ,the follow-up to midnight had something of "Cinderella".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totally charming-- a Cinderella farce that's one of the forgotten peaks of '30s comedy. It's so well-paced that you never feel like you're waiting for the next scene, and it's over fast. It's written like a Continental farce, with familiar high and low and pretend social types, but it has the distinctively sour Brackett-Wilder tone-- plus the in-jokes typical of '30s comedies (Colbert has no French, jokes about her nose, etc.) The actors, even Ameche (a block of wood in the Fox musicals but effective here) all seem unusally relaxed. Maybe it's because they have such good lines to read. It's all high artifice with every line turned and polished; it never touches the ground. Colbert is the American showgirl who floats into Paris high life on a cloud of lies and luck. She gets ensnared in a plot made up by a man (Barrymore) whose wife (Astor) is cheating (with Lederer). Meanwhile, an honest cabbie (Ameche) who's fallen for her turns up and complicates everything. Ameche and Colbert, totally different types, look magnetic in their scenes together-- but maybe it's because she keeps staring at him with those beautiful eyes. What makes it funny is that it's all entirely plausible. Remade in 1945 and 2008, but if you like '30s comedy don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some ways I feel sorry for those that made MIDNIGHT. While it is a wonderful movie, it came out during what many would argue was the greatest year in Hollywood history. 1939 saw such films as GONE WITH THE WIND, GOODBYE MR. CHIPS and MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON and so it's not surprising that films like MIDNIGHT and THE WIZARD OF OZ somehow took a back seat. Had it come out in a different year, it might have taken home an award or at least been nominated.The story begins with penniless Colbert arriving in Paris and being befriended by cabbie, Ameche. However, soon after meeting, she accidentally bumbles into a society party and is mistaken for a guest. From then on, she is sucked into the finest circle and is wined and dined and lives a Cinderella-like life--that is until Ameche shows up and announces he's there to ask her to marry a lowly cab driver.The film has a pretty impressive pedigree--the screenplay written by the exceptional duo of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, directed gracefully by Mitchell Leisen and starring some exceptional actors--Claudette Colbert, Don Ameche and John Barrymore. In just about every way, this was a quality product, though I will admit the story was a bit silly and unbelievable. However, despite these minor limitations, the whole package looked so nice, was constructed so well and was so clever that it was easy to look past how unbelievable the whole thing was.Sweet and enjoyable from start to finish--this is a film worth seeking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic and somewhat dragging before exploding in hilarity i the third act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This didn't begin to well. Though Don Ameche was great all the way Colbert just didn't look or sound the part. After about 10 minutes I figured this would be yet another romcom. But as the film went on and with the introduction of John Barrymore it just got better and better. It was a long process though. Seems like the writers decided to hold back all the fun for one of the better last acts of any comedy.I don't want to spoil the plot but I will tell you that the "build up" is worth the wait. Oh the "build up" part isn't too bad, kinda decent/good actually it's just that the characters aren't too interesting at first and everything seems a bit generic. But as we are drawn further and further into the story it has suddenly come alive.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Happened to catch this little gem of a movie on AMC one night back when they used to show such things. Claudette is charming as the worldly-wise Eve, although her nervous giggles and mannerisms got to me after a bit. Don Ameche makes you forget all about Young Tom Edison as he proves he can BS with the best of them. The way Barrymore speaks his lines makes me want to cast him as one of the Bewitched warlocks, and Eddie Conrad is the 1930s' Danny DeVito. Sure wish AMC hadn't sold out.. Go thou and rent it. It's a wonderful Sunday afternoon romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight-Bright of Day for Writing ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever wrote this deserves a lot of credit. Of course, with such a great cast, they're able to pull this one off. The problem with this wise-cracking film is the end. It is silly and in a way a cop out as well.What a premise! A chorus girl in Paris becomes involved in a plot by a jealous wealthy man to break up the liaison between his wife and her lover. Our rich guy goes so far as to set up the chorus lady as a wife of a baron. All Hades breaks lose when the cab driver shows up as the baron.Claudette Colbert just shines as our lady baroness, and Don Ameche is perfect as the cab driver-turned-baron. In fact, when he is in the car, note the gleam in his eyes. Mary Astor, as the wealthy woman, carrying on with Francis Lederer, displays her usual suspicious, nasty character. John Barrymore, as the jealous husband, is humorous. Remember when he killed in a jealous rage in the Nelson Eddy-Jeanette MacDonald film of 1937? Barrymore certainly proved that he was adept at comedy as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We SHALL Go To The Ball (And Have One)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the NFT poised for a major Wilder retrospective next month I've been getting out my Wilder collection, a mixture of dvds and taped-from-TV videos to remind myself, as if I NEEDED reminding, of a unique and fantastic talent. Most people on this board have said it for me, it IS inexplicable why this gem got lost in the shuffle when all that fuss was being made of what an exceptional year 1939 was for Hollywood movies. Even the pedestrian journeyman director Mitchell Liesen, Wilder's bete noir, couldn't louse this one up and after sixty six years it's still as fresh as it was on its first sneak preview. Colbert was, of course, a class act and could make anyone look good which was just as well because Done Ameche was prime Sequoia 99 per cent of the time but with Colbert he raised his game. It's also more than a bonus to find Jack Barrymore firing on five out of eight cylinders and five Jack Barrymore cylinders leave eight of half the leading men in Hollywood dead in the water. As the title implies this is Wilder and Brackett's take on Cinderella with Barrymore playing the fairy godmother who makes it possible for Cinderella Eve Peabody to go to the ball albeit for more selfish reasons than his fairytale counterpart. As usual with the Wilder of this vintage - see Bluebeard's Eighth Wife, Ninotchka, etc - we're treated to a rich, nay heady mixture of sight and verbal gags. Genius at work. Not to be missed. Watch, Treasure.</fullReview>
