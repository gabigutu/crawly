		<shortDescription>Masquerade in Mexico - Great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I finally received a great copy of this film I had liked on TV as a young child in the 60's. Though I am more into melodramas and suspense films, I thought I would try this one with the lush Mexico settings and lovely music.I noticed some comments here and realize that everyone has his own opinion. After watching the film all the way through, I brought out my copy of Midnight with Claudette Colbert. Yes, I am a really big Claudette fan, but came to like Dorothy in her 40's films; her lovely and gentle manner, great singing voice really enhanced this film.Yes, I like the wildly witty Midnight with Claudette, John Barrymore, and Don AMeche.But, Dorothy singing It's Love and some others was very appealing. Too bad the film had cut Perfidia. I would love to have heard her sing this song my dad had liked during WWII. But it was not in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who needed a remake of "Midnight" ? I certainly didn't ! Dorothy Lamour is a pleasant actress but cannot hold a candle to Claudette Colbert ,the "baroness" of the first version.Besides ,the songs and dances get in the way ,particularly if it's not your kind of music.The only improvement is the phone call to the "sick" little girl,with Patric Knowles providing the voice !That said ,it's certainly enjoyable enough ,but you should favor "midnight" ,out of respect for Colbert.I do not agree with the precedent user as far Leisen's "decline" is concerned :it's relative.More goodies were still to come :magnificent melodramas ("to each his own" An Oscar job by De Havilland)and the best adaptation of Irish's "I married a dead man" ("No man of her own") ,much superior to the French ("J'ai Epousé Une Ombre") or even worse American remakes ("Mrs Winterbourne" )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Limp forties Paramount comedy looks like a schedule filling exercise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The decline in the output of Mitchell Liesen who was once the sharpest director of the Paramount house style comedies at their peak - "Midnight," "Easy Living" "Take a Letter Darling" - overwhelms this mid forties effort in which the mangled remains of the script for "Midnight" can be glimpsed.Fanciful theories have been advanced for the fall from grace of Preston Sturges who got the recognition that should have been spread over the whole Paramount dialogue comedy cycle, but the truth is that, by the end of WW2, Hollywood had lost the feel for these fluffy entertainments. The work of Sturges, Leisen, Elliot Nugent and (better) George Marshall all faltered and changed direction."Masquerade in Mexico" reveals Leisen as the heaviest casualty with a leaden comedy which could as easily have featured any of the contract talent and remained the same picture - Betty Hutton and Brian Donlevy? Lamour is glamorously got up but no one seems to have any confidence in her, playing plot dialogue over her songs and keeping tha camera at a distance which shows off the decor and Edith Head costumes rather than performance.Hard sledding this one.</fullReview>
