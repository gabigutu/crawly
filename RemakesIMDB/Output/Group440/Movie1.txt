		<shortDescription>Terry O'Quinn makes his mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best thrillers to emerge from the 1980s. It has assured direction from Joseph Reuben. An excellent script by Donald E. Westlake.And an absolutely mesmerizing performance from Terry O'Quinn, who invests his character with enough repressed fury to make most screen psychos look like Mr Rogers.The film starts out with a real sense of style as O'Quinn washes his bloody hands in a bathroom sink then proceeds to alter his appearance drastically before walking downstairs to his murdered family; its a startling and creepy beginning and the rest of the film is as stylish and well done. I think its biggest strength is the well-developed psychopathology of Terry O'Quinn's character. His behavior actually makes sense in terms of his madness. This is a refreshing change of pace from most films of this type, where the killers have zero motivation and are just plot-devices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT WATCH!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepfather is an excellent movie, I especially liked the lead actor playing Jerry. His performance set the whole feel of the movie, with his outbursts of rage until he finally snaps. He is also very intelligent, when he snaps he sets up a entire new life in another town before he kills his family. The story is Jerry has become the stepfather in a family of a beautiful, young widow and a lovely daughter. Unfortunately, Jerry has a very strict definition of the perfect family and his new family just may not be making the cut. When his family starts disappointing him, he's is willing to kill for the American Dream. A great movie, not really a horror as such, but more of a psychological thriller that makes you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the plot outline, some of you might roll your eyes and mutter, "Oh, great. A formulaic, plotless, cardboard-character, derivative flapdoodle." Not so. The plot, which gives life and depth to the characters, is so ingeniously written that most viewers will probably not be able to anticipate what's coming next. Breath-taking suspense, occasional pitch-black humor, a creepy, creepy villain, superb acting, and a roller coaster pace all add up to make one heck of a ride. Terry O'Quinn's character is probably the creepiest maniac to ever grace the screen since Anthony Perkins in Psycho. If you have even the slightest interest in horror films, I strongly urge you to rent this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice guy (Terry O'Quinn) gets married to lovely wife (Shelley Hack) and her rebellious daughter (Jill Schoelen). He wants his family to be like "The Brady Bunch" or "Father Knows Best". However when his family doesn't live up to his expectations he brutally kills them, changes his identity and moves on to find another unmarried woman with kids. And he's getting tired of Hack and Schoelen...Exceptional thriller. O'Quinn gives a top-notch performance as the killer. He's helped by a very intricate script. Those two combined make you understand why he kills and plays with your emotions--I found myself actually liking the guy (for a while). There isn't a lot of violence in this, but when it appears it's very sudden, extremely bloody and shocking.The only liabilities here are Hack and Schoelen--they're pretty bad in their roles. But O'Quinn and the script more than make up for them.A sadly forgotten thriller from the late 80s. Well worth catching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was based on a true story. Back in the 1950's a man named John List murdered his wife and kids and married into another family with no father and he was eventually caught. This movie is on a similar basis. This has to one of the best films of the 1980's. Terry O'Quinn is absolutely brilliant as the psychotic stepfather, in other movies you wouldn't think of him as a psychopath like that. Shelley Hack was a bad choice for the wife, the role was unfit for her, in my opinion they should of gotten somebody more dramatic (you choose who), and Jill Schoelen was superb as the daughter, possibly her best film, she played the role as if she lived it before. Charles Lanyer as the psychiatrist was an absolute bore, he should have played the reporter. Stephen Shellen was good as the vengeful brother in law and finally Blu Mankuma as the cop (so what else is knew) seemed like he didn't care about the case. If you want to see a great thriller based on an actual story watch this. I give this 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>watch it and see why. Terry O'Quinn is excellent as "The Stepfather" - Jerry Blake; the nemesis of his newly acquired daughter, portrayed by Jill Schoelen. Shelley Hack plays the unsuspecting mom, who does not realize what O'Quinn is capable of.This film came out in 1987, and it is amusing to see the references to family values and security- all quaintly defined in small town suburbia. Jerry Blake (O'Quinn) is the new realtor in town, a perfect neighbor and family man; but something is awry- Dr. Bondurant is killed and strange occurrences crop up.If you have never seen this film, it is a worthwhile suspense/thriller; there are also some beautiful scenes of the Pacific Northwest- you will enjoy this film for Halloween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superbly chilling, gripping and plausible thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Getting off to an unforgettably bloodcurdling start with a mysterious murderous madman (a beautifully nuanced and persuasive performance by terrific character actor Terry O'Quinn in his breakthrough role) calmly cleaning himself off and walking down the street nonchalantly whistling "Camptown Races" to himself after leaving a house with the mangled bodies of two people he just brutally butchered inside of it, this exceptionally scary, believable and riveting suspense thriller never loosens its grip on the viewer or takes a single false step. You see, our mystery madman is a cunning, devious and above all deadly chameleon who readily changes his identity with alarming regularity in his obsessive and impossible quest to have the ideal American family. His latest marks are a love-blinded denialist woman (nicely played by Shelley Hack) and her smart, astute and rebellious teenage daughter (a hugely sympathetic turn by the very pretty and appealing Jill Schoelen).Director Joseph Ruben, working from a wickedly clever and incisive script by acclaimed crime novelist Donald Westlake, further aided by Patrick Moraz's spooky, stirring score, John Lindley's slick, handsome cinematography, and a deliciously dark streak of pitch-black humor, expertly stokes the tension to a nerve-rattling extreme while maintaining a steady pace and effectively creating a mundane atmosphere of frightening credibility. What makes this movie so special and remarkable is how it deftly explores varying degrees of psychosis: the mother has difficulty dealing with the grim truth, the daughter has a tendency to get into trouble at school, and of course our mystery maniac is the worst offender of all, a crazed perfectionist who will literally kill in order to have what he wants. In an especially nice touch, even a young man (excellently essayed with jolting intensity by Stephen Shellen) determined to avenge his sister's death at the maniac's hands comes across as a rather dubious and none too likable would-be "hero," thereby blurring the fine line between good and evil. Moreover, "The Stepfather" also trenchantly addresses the false sense of security and serenity people tend to erroneously ascribe to suburbia, the danger of accepting others on a strictly superficial level (Hack desperately wants to believe that O'Quinn is the pleasant, mild-mannered man he appears to be), the undeniable fact that all human beings whether they are good or bad are intrinsically flawed by nature, and, most boldly of all, the grossly impractical and unrealistic standards that are constantly perpetuated by traditional conservative family values. Intelligent, insightful and overall thoroughly absorbing, "The Stepfather" stands tall as one of the best horror slasher thriller gems made in the 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performance, Bad Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry O'Quinn is excellent here. He has a definite menacing presence, and his subdued behavior around people only heightens the shock of his raging outbursts. However, the mediocre script ruins what could have been a great film. As a character study of O'Quinn, this would have been chilling and effective. But it makes for a mediocre thriller. O'Quinn plays a psychotic man obsessed with perfection, and the ideal "American Dream". Inevitably, his family disappoints him, so he creates a new identity, kills them and moves on. The scenes with Jerry are strong and frightening, but the film becomes formulaic when we're introduced to Jim, who amazingly discovers a vital clue to his whereabouts in a few minutes of poking around. The police missed this? Too many dumb plot points and the predictable finale spoil it. O'Quinn's performance deserved a better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stepfather has many memorable scenes. Terry O`Quinn portraits a very sick man, and this madness is made clear from the very start of the movie, when the (step)father has just killed his family and we are introduced to him as he removes his beard and in other ways alters his appearence to allow him to find another family and again become THE STEPFATHER. The most memorable scene for me is when he interrupts his step daughter on the porch kissing her date for the evening good night. The stepfather snaps, because he wants the family to remain static for ever, he is crazy. So then his wife comes down and she yells at the stepfather saying that he has ruined what they had built up. The expression on his face when hearing that is one of sheere terror. The stepfather is so fragile. The basement scene where the step daugther is getting something in the freezer and the stepfather rushes into the basement to let off some steem, not knowing she is there. It is all very scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nail biting suspense thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE STEPFATHER is a winner in almost every department! a near perfect white knuckle thriller that never fails to thrill &amp; chill no matter how many times you have seen it! What helps make THE STEPFATHER to this day a very scary thriller that is simply unforgettable, is in it's plot execution &amp; main villain. The films villain while not as ghoulish looking as a Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger, Jason Voorhees or Leatherface, but is perhaps far more terrifying than either one of those monsters, simply because he doesn't look like a rampaging psycho,he doesn't hides behind a mask nor does he hide out in some creepy abandon house or wooded area, but is in fact quiet friendly &amp; cheerful looking, with a very trustworthy looking face. The STEPFATHER sets its chills right in the midst of a nice quiet small town suburbia, with green grass, picket white fences, neighbours, cars, schools. The acting is really good &amp; some of the best to ever grace the screen. Particularly O' Quinn, who is so perfect in the role, that I don't think THE STEPFATHER would even be half as successful without him. Director Joseph Ruben does very well behind the camera, delivering a tight, first rate direction, that really suits the film &amp; the score is fantastic! Oddly enough while it is a pretty fierce thriller in terms of it's plot &amp; execution, THE STEPFATHER could in many ways be construed as an unofficial comedy of sorts. The character of Jerry, the main villain of the piece, has a mindset like that of a false way of life presented in a 1950's family sitcom, ala LEAVE IT TO BEAVER &amp; FATHER KNOWS BEST: A perfect wife who has dinner on the table precisely at six o' clock, on the dot. Loving children who are straight A students at school, are on the student council &amp; are never in trouble &amp; want to spend time with him. A perfect middle class home, the loving smart dog, bright green grass in the front &amp; back yard &amp; a nice white picket fence. At one point, while some people are looking thorough a house, he's trying to sell to them, he's pushing their little daughter on a swing set, telling how his daughter Stephanie is a straight A student &amp; on the student council, both things of which Stephanie is not, since she's been suspended three times &amp; is always getting into trouble &amp; doesn't like Jerry. Another scene that stands out, is after he has set up his new life, he is walking through the neighbourhood &amp; spots a wife, a little daughter &amp; family dog, running out to greet the family man, who is coming home from work. Even though there is no dialogue in the scene, one knows what Jerry is thinking "Why can't my family be like that? why can't I have that kind of life? What sets THE STEPFATHER apart from other thrillers of it's type, is in how well its executed, believe it or not, there are actually times that one actually feels sorry for Jerry, despite the fact we know he's a vicious murderer, particularly in the scene where just after murdering his daughters psychiatrist &amp; setting it up to look like he was killed in a car crash, the rebellious daughter Stephanie apologizes to him, oddly enough, one almost hopes that Jerry finally has gotten the perfect family he has sought for all these years, one almost hopes he gets that perfect family by the end of the movie, especially in the scene following, when they are sitting down to eat dinner &amp; Jerry gives a very moving &amp; heartfelt speech about how thankful he is for the family he has &amp; the thing is he means it. While it may sound odd that one almost feels sorry for the killer, it's not really &amp; that's because the script is so very well written &amp; the characters so interesting &amp; realistic, which is something one cannot say about even the most engaging of thrillers that has been made over the years. STEPHEN SHELLEN stars as the cop brother of Jerry's previous wife still on an obsessive hunt for Jerry/Henry in order to take him down. This is one of the more noteworthy &amp; interesting things the film has going for it, Shellen's character, Jim Oglvie, looks to be set up from the beginning to be the hero of the piece &amp; save the day, but in an ironic twist, he winds up as yet another victim at the end of Henry/Jerry's sharp kitchen knife. Based on the JOHN LIST murder case. All in all, I highly recommend you see THE STEPFATHER, it's easily one of the top ten best thrillers ever made! The only draw back for me personally, was JILL SCHOLEN's performance as the rebellious daughter, while Scholen plays the role well, she's perhaps to good, since her character comes off as whiny &amp; at times self centred &amp; not very likable for the vast majority of the film. Other than that, the whole film is utterly perfect. Despite the fact the film has two other sequels, they were more slasher film in approach, with a high body count, tons of blood &amp; cheesy one liners &amp; while they were each enjoyable in their own right, they weren't as good as this one was. Remade in 2009. Followed by two sequels, starting with STEPFATHER 2: MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't even think about seeing the remake before starting here first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the films that absolutely shouldn't have been remade, a re-imagining of The Stepfather is perhaps the most blasphemous blow ever struck against horror fans. This quiet masterpiece certainly deserves to be discovered by a larger audience, but a remake only ensures that modern day film-goers will soon forget that this classic even exists. For them, The Stepfather will be immortalized in its more recent incarnation. This is truly a shame, because the original is one of the most tense and truly frightening horror films of all time, and improving upon it would be a dour impossibility.Terry O'Quinn is absolutely perfect as Jerry Blake (among others), and his performance here sets a new standard for screen psychos. O'Quinn is warm, inviting, and genuinely likable, and even though we watch him walk through a blood-soaked living room littered with the bodies of his slaughtered family at the film's outset, it is at times impossible to imagine him shifting into that homicidal mode as we watch him interact with his new wife, step-daughter, and his circle of friends. Most acquaintances of real-life serial killers are apt to say they were "the perfect neighbor", and O'Quinn's performance expertly essays the sociopathic abilities of the deranged. It creates a terrifying character, one that we too would likely be lured in by, and though we eventually see manifestations of the murderous rage bubbling beneath O'Quinn's placid veneer, there is never any slip to indicate that anyone around him would ever suspect him of the heinous crimes of his past, and the impending deeds of his future.The film is expertly paced, wringing ever drop of tension possible out of the scenario, and even though we know who Blake really is, and we have a strong suspicion about what is going to happen to his new family, O'Quinn's mastered performance doesn't let us know when he's going to snap until the very moment he does. The scene where Blake turns on a meddling psychiatrist is particularly brutal, and a great indicator of just how aptly Blake fits into his new life. After all, if a shrink could be in such close proximity with him and not notice something off, how could we? Also strongly played is the sub-story about the brother of a previous victim trying to track down Blake and stop him before he kills again. His chase unfolds at a very natural clip, and while it would be tempting for the film-makers to toss in a surprise reveal that would lead him to Blake's new location and speed us into their showdown, it is in fact a series of small clues that lead him there. This heightens the sense of realism that permeates the film, and we are never distracted from being completely engrossed in the possibility that everything we are seeing could absolutely happen, and probably has. Such real-world horrors are key to a modest thriller like this, and in The Stepfather, every one of these keys fit perfectly.Equally realistic is Blake's ability to alter his appearance enough to blend from one life to another. We see him in three different incarnations here, and while there is never any question O'Quinn is at the core, the actor's ability to bring out drastic changes through simple things like facial hair, eyeglasses, and hairstyle is stunning. His benign demeanor is certainly sufficient to rationally dismiss him from suspicion, but when we see how different this cunning killer is able to look from place to place, we can't help but imagine that Blake has been getting away with his predatory pattern for quite some time. (Cleverly, the film never tells us how many families Blake et al. has been "disappointed" by... and not knowing is actually scarier).Blake's championing of traditional family values is a deceptive and macabre mask for him to wear, and the film doesn't waste any time delving into his back-story to hit us over the head with why this is so important to him. Through minor indicators, we can piece together everything we need to know about his mysterious past, and the film-makers are intelligent enough to trust us to do so on our own.When little cracks start to chip away at Blake's facade of domestic bliss, we know which path this leads down, but that doesn't strip away any of the impact of the shocking climax. It's impossible not to gasp at the "who am I here?" scene in the kitchen, which segues into one of the most gritty and realistic bits of violence I've ever seen on the screen. After that, the film kicks into grand guignol mode, and the bloody finale has genuine punch after the slow build leading up to it. Staying true to the realistic bent of the story and execution, the film-makers are wise not to make Blake an unstoppable killing machine, and his crawling determination to finish his homicidal task, despite the gunshot and knife wounds littering his body, holds us in the grip of suspense until the husk that contains Blake's murderous inner demon is too damaged to move anymore.The Stepfather remains squarely in the "cult classic" category as of this writing, and surprisingly, it isn't even available on DVD in the US (this film and the UK release of Creepshow were major factors that led me to invest in an all-region DVD player). Surely, the remake will spark a proper domestic release for this under-seen gem, and I would encourage anyone reading this to seek out the original version before you waste your time with an update that has absolutely no chance of improving on such flawless source material (I'd actually encourage you to not even hand over your money to support the remake, but I'm a realist).Whatever leads you to discover this nearly-forgotten masterpiece, don't miss it under any circumstances. You won't be "disappointed".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet chiller creeps up on you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This nifty little sleeper from the 80's, I thought, played more like a psychological thriller than straight up horror flick. That's not to say that this wouldn't qualify as a horror movie: it has plenty of gore and several "boo" moments. But mostly the film creates and maintains a dreadful feel, like something icky is creeping up on you. Much of this has to do with the tour-de-force performance of Terry O'Quinn as the title character. The amazing thing about this perf is that the character could easily have been cliché psycho, your typical knife-wielding maniac. But O'Quinn tries and succeeds at making The Stepfather a troubled, very troubled man, a man consumed with the concept of the "perfect family." Jerry Blake cons his way into single mom families. Then, when problems arise (standard marriage/family problems to normal people), he butchers the family, changes his appearance, ties up all loose ends, and moves onto the next awaiting mother and daughter. His latest family, Susan and Stephanie Maine (Shelley Hack and Jill Schoelen, who, by the way, is a DEAD RINGER for Demi Moore's younger sister!) adjust to Jerry's presence as well as any average movie "mother/daughter-on-their-own" would: Mother becomes the peacemaker between the Stepdad (trying too hard to click with Daughter) and Daughter (trying too hard to drive Stepdad away). Soon enough, Stephanie is getting some bad vibes from Jerry, starts digging around, and soon, Jerry's past begins to catch up with him. You probably have a pretty good idea of how it all plays out. But O'Quinn is mesmerizing. You really can't take your eyes off of him. Fortunately, director Joseph Ruben included many camera shots that are either close-ups, or start off that way, so that the viewer is really drawn into Jerry's eyes and can feel the fear he emanates. It's really remarkable. His Jerry is a very sick man indeed. He doesn't have knives for hands or a chainsaw to play with, this guy has ISSUES!! Deep, dark, scary issues. And when you see that look on O'Quinn's face during the climactic showdown, you'll know what I mean.To strengthen matters, the other performances are quite good for this type of movie. Schoelen is appropriately childlike yet adolescent as Stephanie, and Hack, as Susan, is maternal, yet vulnerable. Ruben's direction is smooth, careful and restrained. He's smart enough to back off when O'Quinn is doing his thing, but brings a stylish (yet no less creepy) eye to the picture.When the hour and a half was up, I was satisfied and glad that I decided to miss 'Family Guy' to watch this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freaky satire of "Father Knows Best"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk about your domestic issues! Someone's been watching too many 1950's sitcoms, and woe betide anyone who doesn't fit into that image of perfection! After the death of her father one year ago, Stephanie Maine (Jill Schoelen) has been getting into a lot of trouble at school. Part of the reason she's like this is that she's creeped out by her all-too-perfect step-dad, Jerry Blake (Terry O'Quinn). Everyone, especially her mother (Shelley Hack), thinks he's the ideal family man, but Stephanie knows better.Although there is no real humor in this film (there's a clever one liner, but it's not especially funny, nor is it meant to be), this is a satire of the "American Family Ideal." You know what I mean, a white picket fence, a mom and a dad, 2.5 kids, and a dog and a cat. No one really has this, and if they do, it's never the image that is portrayed in magazine ads. Unfortunately, no one told this to Jerry. He wants that so-called perfect family. At first, he seems like a godsend. But if that image is shaken, then he becomes the step-dad from hell.The premise is sound, but it's the execution that's lacking. The pacing is erratic, and the set-up is non-existent. We never get a sense of who Jerry is. To be sure, we know he's a psychopath (this is, after all, a horror movie). But there's little showing of how he wants his family to be. A thriller needs this kind of thing to give us a sense of the psychopath we are dealing with.Apart from O'Quinn, who is very good, the acting varies. Jill Schoelen has moments of believability, but others where her performance doesn't work. Likewise, Shelley Hack is never believable. And both of them are guilty of doing some really stupid things (then again, this is a horror movie). Charles Lanyer is good as Stephanie's therapist who goes above and beyond the call of duty (not in the way you'd think, though). However, Stephen Shellen is horrible as David Ogilvie, the man who's racing against time to find Jerry before he slaughters his next family.Joseph Rueben's direction is plastic. There's nothing special about how this film looks or how the story is told. It's a point and shoot approach, and that leaves it up to the actors (specifically O'Quinn) to induce suspense. There are a few legitimate shocks in this film, but to be honest, there are better options out there.This film may be hard to find, and there's a reason for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Stepfather" is one of the better thrillers to come out of the 1980s: a very pointed look at one very old fashioned individuals' commitment to traditional values, or to put it another way, his intense, ongoing search for perfection. Perfection that, of course, we know can never really be obtained."Jerry Blake" (character actor Terry O'Quinn, in his legendary first starring role) is a mass murderer of families. He selects widows with children, ingratiates himself to the woman, and marries into the family. Desperately seeking an ideal American family, he inevitably erupts into violence whenever the family disappoints him. And then on he moves to another brood, and another fabricated life.O'Quinns' wonderful performance, and the very resonant theme, help to make this a solid diversion. It's based on the real life story of John List, who'd murdered his whole family, and set himself up with a new identity in a new town. He wasn't caught until 'America's Most Wanted' came along in the late 1980s and profiled him. (As a matter of fact, his arrest coincided with the release of this films' first sequel.) The screen story is credited to authors Carolyn Lefcourt, Brian Garfield, and Donald E. Westlake, with Westlake writing the screenplay.Efficiently directed by Joseph Ruben, this works towards a rather conventional finale, but until then is quite gripping. The lovely Jill Schoelen is appealing as the suspicious stepdaughter Stephanie, while Shelley Hack is adequate as Susan, the unsuspecting new woman in Jerry's life. Charles Lanyer, as kindly psychiatrist Dr. Bondurant, and Stephen Shellen, as Jim Ogilvie, are fine in support.The opening sequence is nothing short of chilling, especially considering how calmly O'Quinn plays it. There is a fair amount of gore here, as well as some T &amp; A supplied by Ms. Schoelen. The "Who am I here?" moment has become fairly iconic.O'Quinn reprised his role for the first sequel, but for the third movie, it was recast with Robert Wightman.Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot. Watching the movie is like sitting on a block of ice. It's that chilling. Jerry may look like a friendly neighborhood salesman, what with the winning smile and calm demeanor. Plus, his regard for home and family is almost a sacred observance. At the same time, he talks one heckuva good line. But inside all the candy coating beats the icy heart of a true psychopath.O'Quinn's terrific as Jerry Blake, stepfather extraordinaire. His sudden transitions from Jekyll to Hyde are perfectly executed, and scary as heck. And pity poor stepdaughter Stephanie (Shoelen); she senses something behind his calm demeanor but really has no idea. Then there's wife Susan (Hack) who's just happy having a complete family again; plus, a guy who's a good lover as the movie shrewdly shows.For nutcase Jerry, however, the family is a sacred ideal that allows no shortcomings. In short, it's not the usual ideal we adjust to real people. Instead, in Jerry's bloody hands, it's an impossible standard for any mortal wife or kids. And woe betide those who don't live up to that impossible ideal. Jerry's like a guy in search of a unicorn, but finding only ordinary horses, he kills them, causing the search to go endlessly on.The movie's violence is so sudden it's really jarring. Kudos to director Ruben who knows how to get the most out of Jerry's demonic character. Sure, the premise takes the all-American notion of family and carries it to a psychopathic extreme. Just watch Jerry lovingly raise the model house (bird-house) above everyone's head. It's a perfect visual metaphor for his obsession. And when it comes crashing down, we know we're back to reality. My only complaint is with the overdrawn climax, where people don't die in mortal fashion. Then again, with Jerry that may be appropriate.Anyhow, it's no wonder the 90-minutes has become a cult favorite. Come to think of it, I think I'll go sit in the warm sun for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terry O'Quinn is just terrifyingly good at acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Terry O'Quinn really does elevate some stupid crap." - to loosely quote Brad Jones, the Cinema Snob. The biggest plot holes in the movie stem from how incompetent the police and media are at finding Jerry Blake! They HAVE his picture! All they had to do was run it in the paper! That's sort of how the serial killer John List (this movie was loosely based on) was finally captured! America's Most Wanted broadcasted his story on TV, which had the same effect. With his picture seen by enough people, he had no where to hide. The sub-plot of the Jerry's dead wife's brother hunting him down could have been dropped completely! Despite all of this, I still give the movie an 8 out of 10 for O'Quinn's performance alone. He's that good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepfather</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A serial killer who is in love with the idea of a "perfect family" preys on the Maine family in 'The Stepfather'. The film starts with us seeing Terry Quinn's character changing his appearance and leaving his family home after brutally butchering them. We fast forward some time later to him now going by the name of Jerry Blake, he's got a wife named Susan and is the stepfather to our lead character Stephanie. Stephanie can't stand him and suspects there is more to him than meets the eye. She begins investigating into the murder he committed a year prior, and it isn't long before he catches on. Others begin questioning him as well, and his former brother-in-law from the family he killed is on the hunt for him. With the walls closing in, Jerry beings to crack... and begins to kill.'The Stepfather' is a brilliant late eighties thriller! I first came across it years back when TBS used to show a marathon of the Stepfather series on a regular basis. It's a basic story of a madman, but the performances by the actors involved takes it to another level. Terry Quinn is amazing as the psychotic Jerry Blake, just his mannerisms when he's having his meltdowns are spot on. Jill Schoelen, who became a late eighties scream queen, did a terrific job as the lead female character. And Shelley Hack put in a good performance as Stephanie's mom Susan, the woman he gave into the charms of Jerry. There are some death scenes, some pretty brutal, but the intensity comes from watching Jerry Blake crack under the pressure. Not knowing when he'll snap leaves viewers on the edge of their seats, and when he finally does snap towards the end of the film ... things get scary. Highly recommended.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stepfather is directed by Joseph Ruben and collectively written by Carolyn Lefcourt, Brian Garfield and Donald E. Westlake. It stars Terry O'Quinn, Jill Schoelen, Shelley Hack, Stephen Shellen and Charles Lanyer. Music is by Patrick Moraz and cinematography by John W. Lindley.Why can't they leave me alone? Joseph Ruben's film is firmly ensconced in the land of B horror cultdom, and rightly so. Some horror fans may be disappointed at the lack of brutal killings actually shown on screen, but looking beyond that expectation there beats the heart of a cynical picture. The American Dream shed of its bloody veneer, the film plants an ambiguous serial killer in the normalcy of the family life that he so craves, that is until his vision of Americana family life is not met and his dark half comes to the fore.It's a cunning picture, keeping the killer's back story shaded in grey, and Ruben smartly keeps tension simmering away to keep viewers anxiously waiting for the stepfather to crack. O'Quinn is excellent as damaged dad, intense, measured and charmingly normal when required, and then not over the top when he cracks and rants. Around him he is backed by strong turns from Schoelen, Hack and Lanyer, while Ruben's direction and Lindley's colour photography bring a credible feeling to the plot.A running sub-plot involving Shellen's grieving brother doing detective work feels a bit superfluous at times, while a nude shower scene with Schoelen is totally unnecessary. Don't get me wrong, Schoelen has a lovely body and is a very pretty girl, the actress aged 24 at the time, but she's playing a 16 year old! It just comes off as pointless titillation in a film that didn't need such tricks. Small irritants aside, The Stepfather is intelligent horror and still holding up now in this age of torture and hackville sub-genres. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great horror film with an interesting and original premise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Blake (Terry O'Quinn) is the perfect family man. He's all about the traditional working class "married with children" kind of life. That is, until someone in his family angers him or is basically anything less than perfect. That's when he murders them all, changes his identity, and finds a new family. He's been doing this for quite some time and has gone by many different aliases over the years. His current family consists of his wife Susan (Shelley Hack) and his stepdaughter Stephanie (Jill Schoelen). Everything seems to be going well until Stephanie starts dating, then Jerry decides that it's time to take out the knife and dish out his own form of brutal punishment. Then he can simply find another family under a new identity. Unfortunately for the homicidal stepfather, his former brother-in-law Jim Ogilvie (Stephen Shellen) is hot on his trail. Jim seeks revenge against Jerry for killing his sister, and has just bought a gun ready to dish out some punishment of his own! I've always been a huge fan of this great horror film and appreciate its interesting and original premise. How can you not be intrigued by a brilliant but psychotic man who longs for the perfect family and is willing to try again and again until he gets it right? He doesn't just leave them when things go wrong, he kills them. Terry O'Quinn excels in his performance as the maniacal family man and gives a new meaning to the term "home sweet home". Jerry Blake is one of my favorite horror villains in film history and he probably would not have worked with a lesser actor. Jill Schoelen as Stephanie is a great lead character and, although I was somewhat rooting for the stepfather, I really felt for her and wanted her to come out alive at the end. The vengeful former brother-in-law subplot also had me glued to the screen, as it provided a lot of background to the stepfather character. This movie was followed by two sequels. O'Quinn returned for part 2, which was pretty good although it was basically just a rehash which brought nothing new to the table. Part 3 featured a different actor in the stepfather role, which just didn't work for me at all. I would recommend this movie for anyone who appreciates intricate and engaging horror thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Portrait of a psychotic family man who hides his fury until it erupts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have a man who is a nut case of repressed fury that surfaces when he does not get his way in his family or when someone threatens to uncover his evil deeds. When will he explode and at what will he throw a temper tantrum? Both the script and the performance of the psychotic husband keep the suspense alive because for long stretches he seems perfectly normal, albeit apparently the product of a way too strict childhood. The movie omits these details, and we do not really need them. We are being given a current portrait.When his behavior switches into his murderous cycle, watch out.Quite a piece of acting by Terry O'Quinn. He's a salesman and he sells himself as a family man. Even more, he actually is a family man and tries to create the perfect family. His psychosis is focused on that single notion, and that is indeed how some psychoses work.The modest story has its share of surprises, twists and builds up to a satisfying climax. The movie carves out a small niche for itself and succeeds at its limited mission. A well-balanced story of an unbalanced man who managed to walk the streets, woo women, and marry them -- for a time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the late 80's, you are riding your bike through a typical suburban township, and are being followed by a creepy guy in a sedan...well thats close to the feeling of this film. Terry O'Quinn plays, in what I can remember from watching this when it was first released, a man with some....issues. He wants to be the model American dad, that is until something goes wrong, like an argument, or the fact he can't remember his name. Watching this movie, and later understanding it was in fact loosely based on factual events of a serial killer, I realized what makes this movie so good to the horror fans is that it can happen. Terry portrays a man who slashes his way through families to find the right one, all along the way assuming different identities to cover up his bloody trail. If you like serial killer films, simple gore and blood, simple plots, and creepy guys who need to come in touch with there feelings, this movie is perfect! Kudos to Terry O'Quinn for a job well done acting the lead role of this violent killer flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most positive statements I can make on 1986's 'The Stepfather' is they give away immediately who the bad guy is. Most of the 1980's thrillers, psycho killers, et al that deal with a "Dr Jekyll/Mr. Hyde" seemingly nice guy to friends, families, neighbors took way too long for the "secret" to come out when everyone already knew from just the poster outside. I liked that and though it puts more weight on O'Quinn's shoulders to act deep into a psycho's head, he does it with ease, almost perfection. Unfortunately, everyone else acts like cardboard, but that's okay. Same occurrences happened with Kidman in 'To Die For' or Washington in 'Training Day,' both good (not great) films. All movies mentioned had top notch lead performances. (The following would be a spoiler, if it didn't happen 2 minutes into the film) 'Stepfather' begins with O'Quinn's exit of one family (he slaughtered) to another. He wants the perfect family, or, he just simply has his bar raised too high. New stepdaughter is suspicious, and though justified, she's almost annoying throughout. Meanwhile, someone's seeking justice for the most recently slaughtered family. They were lucky to produce this film 23 years ago, because this guy's leaving his trace and DNA everywhere and for the police to just throw their hands up and give up seems ridiculous by today's standards. But, think 1986, think that this was loosely based on a true story (and of course, if he were more careful, it could easily happen again) and you'll enjoy it more. One other thing I loved about O'Quinn's performance was he wasn't 100% nice guy when he was Dr. Jekyll. He was clumsy, forgetful, human. He played the evil-half perfectly as just someone being very ill. But, when that happens, be someplace else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great nail biter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepfather (Terry O'Quinn) is a man obsessed with the ideal family, his standards and values are old fashioned and all he wants to be is a good father/husband. But if they let him down he becomes a homicidal maniac and wipes out his family and then proceeds to move on to another single woman with kids and start again. He thinks he's finally found salvation in Susan his new wife (Shelly Hack) and Stephanie (Shoelen) her daughter. But when Stephanie starts getting in trouble in school, giving him the cold shoulder and talking about leaving home, the Stepfather gazes at that knife and the word "kill" floats in his mind?.Need a little order around here.The movie starts off on a grim note, lies dormant for a while with a few random explosions of violence and then finally blows up sky high for the finale. The script is tight and extremely well written. It would have been easy for the Stepfather to be written as a one dimensional, psychotic mess, fortunately he's one of the most complex and layered loony since Norman Bates's glory days. This movie deals with ordinary people, in ordinary situations which makes the grisly events much more shocking. The Stepfather is a welcomed addition to the horror genre.Terry O' Quinn leads the pack as the psycotic Stepfather perfectly conveys all of his different facets. From his sweetness, his sadness, his anger to his longing, O Quinn is dead on. Jill Shoelen gives us a down to earth realistic performance and comes across as real teen, her best horror movie role and Shelly Hack (Charlies Angels)gives an underplayed, straight forward performance. All the actors have great chemistry between them.All in all Joseph Ruben's directing is very smooth, the suspense very intense and he even manages to squeeze out some sympathy out of us for that poor psycho. The Stepfather is a real great nail biter with well written chartacters and great acting, the tension is always there and the climax at the end is just brilliant you wouldn't want to take your eyes of the screen for a second.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tight, tense, superbly written thriller from Joseph Ruben. Terry O'Quinn is utterly convincing and downright hilarious as obsessive/compulsive nutbag Jerry Blake (The Stepfather), a Father Knows Best-type who is fixated on marrying into a perfect family he can control with an iron fist. Unfortunately, he meets with constant disappointment in his quest for suburban bliss and turns to murder to ease his frustrations. This premise is milked to the max by Ruben and screenwriter Donald Westlake. Watching O'Quinn come apart at the seams is a dark joy, as are his acts of brutal violence and bloody murder. Sequels inevitably followed, but they were inferior animals indeed. A black-humored classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepfather: A Good, Old-Fashioned 80s Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two sequels and a remake, "The Stepfather" still holds up to this day as a very cool and creepy thriller. When I first saw it, for me, it was just decent. Then I watched it a second time, and it had gotten so much better. This movie is one of the best sleeper hits of the 80s.Jerry Blake is the perfect family man. He has a great job in American Eagle realty, has a wonderful new wife, Susan, and a misunderstood daughter, Stephanie. Susan adores Jerry, but Stephanie is extremely awkward and weirded out around him. Right now, Jerry is close to having his perfect vision of "family." Until Stephanie catches wind of the man who murdered his family in another town. And other people begin to catch on to the fact that Jerry isn't at all what he seems to be. That's when Jerry really begins to snap. And if he can't have the American Dream, then he's going to make sure that he gets it, at all costs."The Stepfather" works very well as a thriller, and not a horror movie. It is extremely well-written, and the acting is perfection. This movie could have been an epic failure, but it has tons of energy and when it's supposed to be scary, it is.But the main attraction of the movie is Terry O' Quinn's show-stopping performance as Jerry, before he went on to star in the hit TV series "Lost." He makes this character so believable and frightening. And when he has his first meltdown, in the iconic "basement" scene, you are on the edge of your seat, wondering when this guy is going to completely lose it.The film was inspired by the real murders of John List, who had killed his family, and left his town in search of another one. He had disappeared for 18 years until he was discovered on "America's Most Wanted." This is a very interesting and original idea for a thriller, and Donald E. Westlake provides a very suspenseful script.Despite some extremely cheesy music and some unnecessary but inevitable nude scenes, "The Stepfather" is an 80s thriller that I enjoy very much. When the remake came out, I had known several people who still remember the original 1987 classic and O' Quinn's chilling portrayal of a madman. If you haven't seen the remake yet, you might want to wait until it comes out on DVD, and give the original "Stepfather" a try. It's worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a general rule, I don't quote dialogue from a movie in my comment summary (to me, it seems like the lazy thing to do), but the above line, as uttered by Terry O' Quinn towards the end of The Stepfather, is so perfectly delivered that I decided to make an exception. And this is just one of many genuinely chilling moments in this excellent 80s thriller that go to make it unmissable entertainment for anyone who loves scary movies.The lovely Jill Schoelen plays troubled teen Stephanie, who has every right to be disturbed: her father died a year ago, and she suspects that her new stepfather, the seemingly perfect Jerry (O'Quinn), is a serial killer. Of course, Stephanie is right?Jerry IS a complete nutter: desperate to become part of a perfect American family, he marries widows and divorcées with children, but kills them when they fail to measure up to his exacting standards.Jim Ogilvie, the brother of one of Jerry's past victims, is hot on the psycho's trail, but with Jerry becoming increasingly disappointed with his new stepdaughter, will Jim catch up with the maniac before another family is slaughtered?Sharply written, with excellent direction from Joseph Ruben, and a brilliant central performance from O'Quinn, The Stepfather rarely puts a foot wrong. At a push, one might argue that Jerry's ability to adopt a new persona after each massacre is a touch too easy, but this is a minor quibble and doesn't affect the power of the film in any way. Schoelen is also superb, offering just the right balance of vulnerability and spunky bravado (plus we get to see her in the shower?hurrah!).The Stepfather proved to be a minor success on it's original release, and inevitably spawned a sequel, but over the past two decades, it seems to have been forgotten by many (no-one at my place of work seemed to know anything about it). Now that a remake is in the pipeline, perhaps more people will choose to investigate the original; it's a film that certainly deserves to be rediscovered by the masses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performances in Nice Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepfather (1987)*** (out of 4) Troubled teenager Stephanie (Jill Schoelen) is still suffering the side effects of her father's death a year earlier but things don't get any better when her mother (Shelley Hack) marries a new man (Terry O'Quinn). Stephanie thinks there's something wrong with Jerry but she doesn't realize that he's actually a serial killer who gets rid of his "family" after they disappoint him.THE STEPFATHER pretty much came out of nowhere when it was released and became a nice little hit for the studio. There are certainly elements of various movies rolled up here but there's no question that the film works wonders especially with the terrific performances and some intense scenes towards the end. The movie certainly isn't flawless and at times it shows it's B-budget but it's still a nice gem that has plenty going for it.I think the greatest thing is the fact that O'Quinn is simply brilliant in his role. The first time we see him we see the aftermath of his brutal murders and yet the actor is so charming in the part and so charming to his new family that you can't help but like him. O'Quinn is so believable in the part that you easily forget that you're actually watching a cold-blooded monster. Once the character begins to crack, O'Quinn doesn't miss a beat. Schoelen is also extremely good in her role and is quite believable as the teen who just knows something isn't right. Hack, Charles Lanyer and Stephen Shellen are also good in their parts.The film has some nice tension throughout and especially the finale, which packs a nice little punch. As I said, the film certainly isn't flawless as there are some pacing issues that make the film move a bit too slow but this here doesn't take away from all the good stuff. I'd also say some of the sync music score could have been thrown away. Still, THE STEPFATHER contains some terrific performances that makes it worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently widowed Susan thinks she's met the perfect new husband in Jerry Blake. Unfortunately, Jerry has a dark side to him, and only his stepdaughter Stephanie suspects the horrible truth: that "Jerry" is actually a serial killer who married widowed or divorced women with kids, plays the happy stepfather for a little while, before something sets him off, prompting him to murder every single one of them and move on to a new family and town after changing his name and appearance. Can Stephanie convince those around her of Jerry's true nature before it's too late for her and her mother? Or will Jerry's cycle of insanity and murder continue? Much has been said of Terry O'Quinn's powerful performance as Jerry and I have little to add except that I agree he's excellent in the role. His violent mood swings are truly terrifying to behold and yet, when he's calm, he honestly seems like he's trying to be a loving father.</fullReview>

The only person suspicious of Jerry's motives is his step daughter, Stephanie. She investigates his past and as soon despises that he may be a killer who has changed his identity before marrying her mother, bad things begin to happen to people close to them.O'Quinn is diabolical as the smiling dad of the year in "The Stepfather" and the tension is unrelenting to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cyberpath Psycho Killer Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah I remember the America's Most Wanted profile on serial murderer John List, the uptight freak who used to mow his lawn wearing a shirt &amp; a tie, and would relax at the end of the day by changing into a different shirt &amp; tie. Eventually murdered his family when he got tired of dealing with the bills, assumed a new identity, took up with a new clan in a new town and more or less disappeared for 20 years standing right there in front of you. One has to wonder how many other times something like that has happened and it's more prevalent than you'd think.The term used these days is CYBERPATH (Google it sometime), usually describing sociopaths who use the internet as a way to ingratiate themselves into the lives of others and leech off them. There literally are scores of professional grifters who go from one domestic situation to the next, living like parasites off unsuspecting women (and men: con artists can be women too) who were maybe looking to fill an empty spot in their lives. Social networking websites and online dating services have made it all too easy for people to anonymously seek out new situations -- the preferred target/victims are usually divorced or widowed and all too happy to take up with the Mr. Perfect who appears out of nowhere to sweep them off their virtual feet.After a few weeks the odd behavior starts to raise eyebrows. They turn out to not do or work where they say they did -- if they even have a job at all -- become increasingly secretive and angered when confronted with inconsistencies, building a web of lies that eventually becomes too convoluted for even the liar to keep track of. Usually they are working new targets while wearing out their welcome, often visiting with these new sources of income/sex/subsistence under the guise of work related travel while keeping up appearances back at home. And when the stuff hits the fan and the lies are revealed they are out the door &amp; set up with a new place to live and grift some more until its time to move on again, rinse and repeat ... Sound familiar? You very well could be the victim of a cyberpath too and not even know it. I almost was, which is why I read up about it and learned enough to recognize the core behavior of a sociopathic leech.THE STEPFATHER covers all those bases, just without the secretive online life &amp; locked out cellphones. The scenario the film establishes is even more possible today then it ever was with the added movie thriller touches like disguises, brutal murders, psycho killer histrionics, and "Lost" actor Terry O'Quinn is very credible as the psychopathic perfect family man Jerry. One troubling aspect of the movie is how it went out of its way to set up hottie actress Jill Schoelen (who was 23 at the time of production) as a 16 year old girl and then trots her out for an infamous naked shower scene that instantly transforms the movie from an all too likely urban thriller into an exploitation film.Then you read more &amp; learn that the film was actually written in part by a woman, along with noted crime writer Donald E. Westlake, perhaps best known for the novel "The Hunter" which provided John Boorman with his source material for his 1967 neo-noir classic POINT BLANK. For some reason the writers &amp; producers felt it necessary to suggest jailbait nudity, but then again horror movies always have been expected to have elements in them that were uncalled for or meant to shock or disturb. It is only recently that they have become more sanitized &amp; predictable, substituting graphic dismemberment for more disturbing suggestions. Think of how relatively bloodless the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" was in comparison to just your basic SAW movie to see what I mean.In any event this is still a crackerjack little thriller, expertly staged with some great shock sequences, never boring and tightly written enough to recommend it even if openly wondering what the real intentionality at work was behind certain scenes. The one place where I thought it mis-stepped was in the scene where the young daughter oversees an over the top meltdown by the psycho and isn't believed by anyone when she reveals what she saw. You'd think her mom would have taken it a bit more seriously at any rate, but then again that's one of the aspects about the 2009 era real life cyberpath stories which is all too common: Nobody questions what they want to believe in, and all too often people are just not what they seem even after you think you've known them for 20 years.

		<fullReview>was surfing through the channels one October night in 2005, I ran into this film. It was already 5 minutes into the beginning so I missed a good deal of intro on the title character. The cinematography seemed like some Canadian film or something. So anyway, at first I was like huh?-some of these actors......yeah this really is a motion-picture-sop-opera, and then Terry O'Quinn (whom I'd never seen until this film) comes into character, and man was I blown away! This (what looked like a "B-horror" film) turned into a 3star Thriller! I fell instantly in love with this film and it is rising into my top 10 movies list. I've watched it over and over now. The Stepfather is truly a classic! It has this essence to it that you can't find in many other films. Something like this would have never played well had it been made in the 90's or even now! The script was shifty, but the casting/timing was perfect on this film! Terry O' Quinn really should have been awarded for his performance! This is an excellent example of a classic low-budget film. Honestly I would say it is an like an 8/10, but based on how IMDb ratings are valued, the overall ratings should go up to like 6.6 or 6.7 out of 10. "NEXT TIME JIM...

The opening scene in my opinion was fantastic, the film progresses with a typical 80s soundtrack (which ain't a bad thing) Terry plays a great part and does it really well, He manages to keep a certain creepiness to the part throughout. I don't want to give much away so ill cut this short although the story is self explanatory. I plan on buying the sequel and hope thats as good.Either way certainly worth a watch, and if you're an Oquinn fan like myself, Just buy the DVD it will be cheap enough wherever you look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terry O'Quinn gave a stunning performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am Valdez, author of I Ain't Bitin' My Tongue. Terry O'Quinn gave a masterful performance as the psychotic stepfather, marrying into fatherless, existing families, and reeking havoc. The soundtrack, however, is just as magical as the film. Although never officially released, the score has a romantic, soothing underlay, inspiring fond imaginations of the "perfect family," and the "perfect life." This movie is mystifying from start to finish. You sit upon the edge of your chair, waiting for the phrase, action, look, or event, that makes this otherwise flawless father, husband, and provider, shift into executioner mode. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father Knows Death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS!]Do you think you've got a creepy relative? Perhaps a creepy stepfather? Well, he may be nothing compared to the one in this story. It all started not too long ago. A man named Henry Morrison casually showered and shaved off his beard, removed his glasses and put in contacts, then he picked up his suit case and marched casually out of his house, where in the living room, his family lay brutally slain. The fact is, he had murdered his own family. Even his children. Furniture was destroyed, the carpet soaked in blood. This man was a clever con. He'd marry into the family of a widow or divorcée who has children and try to make it the perfect All-American family, but when something happens to screw that up, he leaves to go setup a new job in a new town with a new family, then he kills the old family and just moves on. And that is just what Henry did. He changed his name to Jerry Blake and married a widow named Susan Maine. Susan had a daughter, Stephanie, who took an immediate dislike to Jerry. She told her school counselor, Dr. Bondurant, about him but nothing he could say could change Stephanie's mind. Not even when Jerry bought her a dog. Stephanie is a real problem child. She was always getting into fights at school, mostly the ones she started. She's been suspended numerous times, and that last fight in art class got her expelled! Needless to say, Susan and Jerry were disappointed to hear this. Jerry often seeked refuge in the basement where he had set up his work shop. There were all kinds of sharp an dangerous tools all around. He was using them to make a bird house; A young man, Jim Ogilvie, had recently become interested in the story of the man, Henry Morrison, who brutally slayed his family a year ago. The reason for this was because the wife of the family was Ogilvie's sister. He asked his friend at the newspaper to recirculate the article again. At a barbecue, Jerry read the article and became very upset. He raced down to the basement to let off some steam. Unfortunately Stephanie was down there at the time and she witnessed everything.Stephanie tells Dr. Bondurant, who wanted to meet Jerry face to face. Jerry was uninterested, so Dr. Bondurant decided to trick Jerry. Since Jerry was in real estate, Dr. Bondurant pretended to be interested in buying a house and so he asked Jerry to show it to him. Well the doctor and Jerry met the next afternoon. Jerry seemed to be very friendly, but unfortunately Dr. Bondurant just asked one too many personal questions. Paranoid Jerry felt the doctor was on to him, so he grabbed a 2x4 and beat him to death. Then he placed Dr. Bondurant's body in his car and blew it up. When hearing of Dr. Bondurant's death, due to an "accident", Stephanie was very sad. Jerry managed to get Stephanie back in school, as well as an appointment with another counselor. But when visiting Dr. Bondurant's old office, Stephanie found the appointment date Bondurant had written for when he was to go meet Jerry. Stephanie's friend, Paul Baker, was glad to have Stephanie back. He took her for a ride on his Vespa bike and he even managed to get a kiss at Stephanie's door step. Unfortunately, Jerry burst out at that moment, shouting like a maniac, for he feared Paul was trying to rape Stephanie. Paul ran. Stephanie calls Jerry a creep. Susan smacks her. Stephanie runs. Susan yells at Jerry. He walked eerily away.Jim Ogilvie was searching the neighborhood for anyone who may know the killer. He knew the man's new name, Jerry Blake, and was closing in fast; The next day, Jerry quit his job at the real estate firm, then he boarded a ferry to a new town, then he glued on a mustache, removed his wig and put on glasses and donned the new name of Mr. Hodgkins. He got a job at an insurance bureau and even met his next bride-to-be. Well it wasn't long before Susan discovered something very strange about her husband. She tried calling him at work only to discover he had quit his job several days ago. Well, Jerry accidentally fell out of character for a moment and when Susan corrected him, he brutally attacked her! Meanwhile, Stephanie is up in the shower and did not hear what transpired downstairs. Jerry threw Susan into the basement, just as Jim Ogilvie stopped by. Nobody appeared to be around. Then, Jerry appears and they meet face to face again...For the last time. Jerry drew his knife and plunged it into Ogilvie's gut. He was dead. Jerry grabbed the knife and went after Stephanie. She got out of the shower, saw Ogilvie's corpse and ran. She ran into the attic, her only refuge. Jerry followed her up and luckily fell through the floor. It wasn't long before they met up again, but it was Susan to the rescue who fired Ogilvie's pistol at Jerry, then Stephanie grabbed Jerry's knife and finished the job. Jerry lay dead at the bottom of the stairs, and so things went back to normal. Susan and Stephanie got along happily after that, and widows and divorcees could once again rest at ease because the so-called 'stepfather killer' was dead...Or was he?The Stepfather was a good movie. I didn't know what to expect when I saw it at the video store. I saw it and thought it was very good. Terry O'Quinn was born to play this role! He was so good. He could play a nice friendly guy as well as a terrifying raging lunatic. Shelley Hack (Good name for a movie like this) is a good Susan, and Jill Schoelen is a sexy Stephanie. The guys will like the nude scene of her in the shower and the girls will like the nude scene of Terry O'Quinn in the shower at the beginning. As he gets in, take a look in the mirror and you'll see something that nearly made this an X-rated movie. I was puzzled at the fact that Jerry was killed in this movie, and yet there is a Stepfather II. I wonder how he managed to come back to life, when he's a regular human being, unlike Freddy and Jason. So yes, there was a Stepfather II in 1989, and a Stepfather III made-for-TV movie in 1992. Stepfather III didn't have Terry O'Quinn in it but it apparently features the same killer. If someone ever wants to awaken this series again, we'll expect a Stepfather IV. Maybe in that one, he could be a step-grandfather as he would be older by then. But anyway, this Halloween if you're tired of the same old slashers and want to see a real suspenseful thriller that could be happening right in your town, I recommend The Stepfather! -</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best openings I have ever seen! Terry O'Quinn changes out of his bloody clothes and takes a shower. He changes into a suit and walks down stairs as nothing has happened. He just murdered his family.He puts the phone back on the hook and walks outside. He picks up a news paper and walks on his way through the perfect looking neighborhood. He gets involves with a new family. Jill Schoelen the new stepdaughter doesn't like Jerry Blake (Terry O'Quinn).You see Jerry Blake wants the perfect family and Stephinie(Jill Schoelen) thinks he is too fake and old fashion. Jerry buys Stephinie a dog and mentions how he had a dog when he was young and he was Rin tin tin to him. In another scene Jerry is watching Mr Ed on TV. He even has the perfect Thanksgiving with family that the Rockfellows could have been jealous of and builds a birdhouse. Jerry has another side to him, flipping out in the basement, throwing around his tools. Freaking out when Stephinie kisses a boy she likes. A really good scene is when Jerry decides the family with Shelly Hack is not working, he had quit his job and Shelly Hack tried calling him but they said he quit, Hack Confronts O'Quinn on this and he says wait a minute who am I here? and Hack says "Jerry" and he hits her hard with the phone and says thanks honey. here are a bunch of good one liners as well from O'Quinn. Jill Schoelen went on to make Popcorn and When a Stranger calls back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found "The Stepfather" to be one of most intelligently written and frightening films of this genre I have had the pleasure of viewing. Terry O'Quinn absolutely nails the part. What is truly scary about this movie is there really are people like Jerry Blake out there. We all know when we see Freddy Krueger or Frankenstein's monster to beware, but the Jerry Blake's of this world sneak up on us.This story has real plausability and is tight from beginning to end. The cast is absolutely stellar led by Terry O'Quinn. I have noticed that some reviewers dismiss the film as just another slasher movie. I totally disagree. While there is graphic violence I found it to minimal and not at all gratuitous; after all this is a movie about a serial killer.In conclusion I will say that though I consider "The Stepfather" an absolute gem, the sequels are a total waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely worth a look!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry O'Quinn plays a fantastic nut case in this great little thriller. Although there is some blood and violence in the film, The Stepfather is far from being a slasher type movie. What lifts it above the standard fare is O'Quinn's very believable portrayal of Jerry Blake -- a certifiable whacko. Some favorite scenes are when Blake meets his step daughter's psychologist, when Blake has a discussion with himself in the basement, and when he has a little trouble with his identity while on the phone. Not the best movie ever filmed, but O'Quinn makes it worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this is not the typical horror movie that I expected and wanted it was a really good suspense thriller movie. The killer has a simple motivation for killing his victims. He wants the perfect family so he goes around using different identities and then finds a single mom with a kid and pretends to be totally sane and treats them nice until one little screw up makes this family un-perfect and sets him off. Rent this movie and then its sequels, all are good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EW has recently (June) rated their 25 choices for scariest films of all time and it was a surprise to see this small but intelligent film get a most deserving nod in the category. While not up there with classics like "The Exorcist" and "The Shining", this film earns its title through a brilliant turn by small role actor Terry O'Quinn in his best role ever as Jerry Blake, a man bent on finding the 'perfect' American family. when the family disappoints, he snaps. The tension throughout the film rises as his stepdaughter begins to suspect things as Jerry becomes more and more scary in private. One of the most convincing roles of a psycho on film, Jerry's most disturbing moments are when alone and muttering to himself. An unknown treat.</fullReview>

He brings subtlety and eerie chills to a part that for anyone else would scream for hammy overacting and nervous facial tics. He doesn't play the deranged psychopath but rather the perfect Ward Cleaver with something terrible lurking beneath the surface. When he finally explodes, he is truly terrifying. This is by far the best acting I have ever seen in a horror movie, and the entire movie is worth its silly elements just for the "phone" scene...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awww the American Dream. A mother and father, two kids, a house surrounded by a picket fence, the whole nine yards. In the 1950s this is what just about every family aspired to, but how realistic is it really? Sure everyone wants a family and nice place to live, but what really defines a family? Truth is that a family can be anything, as long as there's love right? Well what if there was someone who wanted that old fashioned kind of family so much they'd kill for it? That's where this film comes in, a Thriller that was a real sleeper in it's time and still has quite an impact all these years later.Pros: Solid performances. Nicely scored. Fabulous cinematography. Perfectly paced, starting slow and then building towards an exciting finale. Director Joseph Ruben does a more than fine job of creating tension. Intelligently written. Grounded in reality, making it all the more scary. Suspenseful and riveting. A frightening villain that thankfully never goes too over-the-top.Cons: Somewhat dated. The subplot with the brother out for revenge goes nowhere and just takes us out of the main action.Final thoughts: Who says father knows best? This one wouldn't know it if it bit him. But that's what makes this gem so much fun to watch. They just don't make them like this anymore and it's nice to go back revisit films like this one. A classy nail-biter worth seeking out.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O'Quinn is the reason to see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Small scale but well done horror flick that inspired two sequels and a remake. I desired to watch it mostly because it starred Terry O'Quinn of Lost fame. He plays the titular stepfather, a psycho who desperately longs for the perfect, 1950s TV-inspired family. He hooks up with established families as the mother's new husband, but turns violent as soon as the family hints at imperfection. The film starts off with him leaving his latest murder victims, and picks up with him just having married a widow (Shelly Hack) with a teenage daughter (Jill Schoelen). Schoelen hasn't taken the death of her father well, nor her mother's marriage to this new guy so soon afterward. She begins acting out at school, which irks O'Quinn toward murderousness. After she witnesses a secret tirade, and after seeing an article in the newspaper about the previous murders, she begins to investigate her new stepfather. The main reason to see this is for O'Quinn. His nutjob is almost at a Norman Bates-level of quality. A lot of the rest of the film is majorly flawed. Schoelen is cute and not a bad actress, but she can't pull off bad girl at all. And it never makes sense that the police never caught this guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Locke Kills His Family - sufferforyourart.com review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing quite like a satisfying little thriller. It doesn't pretend to be too important or ground-breaking, it doesn't make its villain too omnipotent, and it doesn't have too-smart-for-its-own-good subtext. This modesty takes the intriguing premise of Joseph Ruben's The Stepfather and raises it to a whole new level, creating a classic and unnerving thriller for the whole (dead) family.Jerry Blake (Lost's Terry O'Quinn) is the titular stepfather of Stephanie (Jill Schoelen), a 16-year-old high school student with a knack for picking fights and being a generally ill-behaved brat. Her mother Susan (Shelley Hack) trusts her new husband to the utmost degree, but Stephanie feels that there's something wrong. What neither knows is that Stephanie is more than correct: Jerry is a serial killer obsessed with family values, and Stephanie's teenage angst doesn't jive with his need for perfection. Meanwhile, Jim Ogilvie (Steven Shellen), the brother of Jerry's last wife/victim, is on the hunt for the elusive murderer.Director Ruben crafted quite the slice of horror thriller cinema with this 1987 gem, opting to let O'Quinn's frightening performance carry the film. The general execution is handled with pure professionalism, and the cinematography by John Lindley is very nice to look at, but it's all really rather ordinary. The entire film acts as framework for O'Quinn, who chews this well-developed scenery like a lesbian with carpet. Of course his most frightening moments, where his anger takes over and he becomes a rambling psychotic are easily noted as some of the more intense elements, but even the quietest moments are best called unnerving. We as the audience know from the very beginning what he is, so to see and hear him giving monologues about keeping the family together and how important it is to him is? kind of creepy.The supporting cast does their job well enough, never upstaging O'Quinn but also never diving into mediocrity. Jill Schoelen plays a 16-year-old girl like she should, as a 16-year-old girl. She's never too smart for her age or overly stereotypical, but at the same time she has an active and somewhat immature interest in boys and talking on the phone. She's believable, and I liked that. Shelley Hack as Stephanie's mother gives off enough insecurity to make it as a widow looking for the missing piece to her life, adequately combining weakness with love for her daughter. Our proposed hero Jim comes off as a bit one-dimensional, but Steven Shellen's intensity gives him just enough believability to float rather than sink.Of course, all of these characters are nothing without a good script, and Donald E. Westlake delivers. It's not the most original execution, and follows a pretty straightforward storyline. Westlake doesn't burden us with any over the top twists, instead relying on an intense character riding a unique premise. The simplicity of it all is admirable and while the script could have been helped by a more complex plot, it could have just as easily been hackneyed junk. Considering all of the possibilities, it's comforting to know that keeping everything simple and unassuming can still create entertaining, if sometimes subtle, thrills and chills.The Stepfather isn't a masterpiece, but it's still quite an achievement. Taking an idea that could have just as easily been a Lifetime Original Movie and morphing it into one of the more disturbing low key thrillers of the '80s as well as creating one of the greatest opening sequences in horror is commendable, especially when you're the same guy who directed The Good Son.For more horror reviews, visit sufferforyourart.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The StepfatherExcellentI would recommend The Stepfather to anybody who loves and edge of your seat thriller ride! A brilliant film with a great cast. Overlooked when first released due to bad advertising, Which is such a shame! Terry O'Quinn's (Now a Star in the Spectacular hit t.v Show Lost)is captivating and perhaps one of the many great performances i have witnessed in watching a wide selection of Horror movies. He performs with such realism and even though he is a "psycho" there are points in the film that make you sympathise with him. Some great one liners "somebodys been a naughty girl" and "who am i here" are just some brilliant moments in a spectacular film. the film also focuses on the American Dream and how far a man will go to get it.The director Ruben creates a Psychological Thriller/ Horror whilst keeping the film realistic unlike many silly horror films. The film is also quite reminiscent of Hitchcock. Great Cinematography! Great Acting! Great Direction! Great Everything!!!!A film that makes you think....do i really know them?

		<fullReview>I guess when all is said and done, "The Stepfather" is really just a slasher movie. But . . . it's actually a petty damn good one. A great deal of that is the script and taut direction, but also the pacific northwest setting lends some nice eerie atmosphere. Although there's not a whole lot to say about the casting (they just function), it's Terry O'Quinn who claims this movie for his own, and he's really something to see here; a deranged realtor, moving from one fatherless family to the next until his dreams of the ideal Cleaver household are fulfilled (great satire on family values in Reagan's America). But O'Quinn shifts from calm to madness with the flick of a switch and he puts on a how-to on dominating a movie. Its a defined character with just enough hint of backstory to be real (not to mention psychotic). More importantly, he's unforgettable.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepfather: slasher sleeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepfather is one of the most ingenious and original thrillers i have seen in years, and one of the few films that echoes Hitchcock without robbing his grave.(More exclamations: a sleeper, an underrated surprise that's a knockout from start to finish.)Terru O'Quinn starts as a nice guy who happens to slaughter his loved ones whenever his ideal family fails to live up to Father Knows Best rerun. Then he resettles with another household, figuring practice makes perfect. He's a serial killer, a domesticated Norman Bates, and what's most frightening is that you like this guy. O'Quinn turns in a riveting performance, and you pray that he doesn't crack, and you want his candy-coated dreams to come true. When he snaps, watch out. His acts of violence make you wince in pain and shock from their suddenness. Director Joseph Ruben and screenwriter Donald E. Westlake underscore the tense mood with a perfect measure of twisted black humour. Unlike Hitchcock copycat Brian De Palma. Ruben's cinematic references to Hitch's Shadow of a Doubt, Suspicion, Psycho and even The Birds add to the fun without calling attention to themselves and stopping the film dead. This clever thinking man's slasher film wont disappoint. Whew!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry O'Quinn stars as a man who appears to be a loving husband and father, but turns out to be a regular Norman Bates. His stepdaughter (Jill Schoelen) tries to convince her mother and everyone that the stepfather is a maniac, but no one believes her. The plot sounds a lot like Hitchcock and the movie does resemble some of his films, most notably PSYCHO. There is a lot of suspense here, especially in the rollicking finale. It also has a rather creepy opening which shows us that this man is not going to win the Father of the Year contest.The performances are good also, most of all O'Quinn. He was made for this part. Schoelen would go on to star in numerous other tales of terror, such as Cutting Class (1989) and When A Stranger Calls Back (1993).THE STEPFATHER is rated R for violence, language, nudity, and adult content. I give the movie 3 1/2 stars out of a possible 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terry O'Quinn Reigns Psycho Supreme in This Slasher-Stand-Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry O'Quinn makes this horror story of a man obsessed to have the perfect family a watchable, fun treat. His performance is dead-on: humorous, terrifying, and slimy all in one.SPOILERSThe movie's beginning is undeniably well done: rather than show a maniac viciously killing his screaming victims, as most standard slasher fare does, instead shows a calm, collected man splattered with blood, take a shower, apply face-changing makeup, and then sport a blazer and a genuinely nice, fake smile. Then as he descends the staircase to leave, we see where the blood came from: he has killed his family, blood smeared on the walls and destruction littering the home. It's a shocking beginning, and when O'Quinn begins non-chalanty humming "Camptown Races," it is very clear this is a cut above normal horror flicks.There's other great scenes in this flick, and while the story may sometimes waver a bit and plod along, O'Quinn's brooding rages and his subtly funny dialogue ("You know...family, home sweet home, ALL THAT CRAP!") revives the film and makes it a thrilling ride.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film when it was released because I had nothing better to do that day. I absolutely loved it. Terry O'Quinn plays a great psycho in this film. There are 2 brutal scenes - one involving a 2 X 4 and one involving the telephone that are still very memorable. I highly recommend this horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from a classic many Horror fans make it out to be, but still an effective suspense thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed The Stepfather, it was suspenseful and got the job done for me, but it is by no means any classic, by any stretch of the imagination. Terry O'Quinn is honestly the major reason to see this, his performance has to rank as one of the all time best as far as Horror performances are concerned. It does a great job of building up the mother and daughter|wonderfully played by Jill Schoelen| and especially building up the suspense, it was very well done. One of the benefits the original holds over the average remake is, it's not PG and doesn't hold back on the violence. There are some very gruesome images here, and while not overly gory it still hits home. I didn't care for the subplot of Stephen Shellen's character who was after Jerry due to him killing his sister, it dragged and I didn't like it at all. The most effective relationship is between The Stepfather and The Daughter by far. It was creepy and sent a couple of chills down my spine on a couple of occasions.Performances. Terry O'Quinn should be inserted into the Horror Hall of Fame for his frightening portrayal here. He is this movie, and he has a perfect blend of instability and normality, his split personality routine was just great. Jill Schoelen often gets criticized for her performance, but I thought she was terrific. She was easy on the eyes, and she gave a very effective vulnerable performance. Shelley Hack is OK but definitely had her off moments as The Mother.Bottom line. It's not a classic like many say, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. I'll definitely be watching this one again, it'll do the job for needed thrills.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good thriller that stands the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film a couple of days ago and I was pleasantly surprised.Even thought 22 years have passed since the movie came out and in that time the thriller genre has been (over)done countless times in all ways possible, The Stepfather stands the test of time still being quite effective as a thriller. Its a very enjoyable movie and unlike many movies of that decade it doesn't feel very dated. Terry O'Quinn (who you can now see doing a brilliant job in TV show Lost) plays Jerry Blake, a man who marries widows and divorcees with children in search of the perfect family. The problem is Jerry likes things to go his way which can cause friction. When things start to really bother him, Jerry kills the family, changes his appearance and moves to another town where he begins his crazy ritual again. Terry O'Quinn did a great job playing this sick and very twisted individual and I'm sure when the movie came out it must have caused quite a stir because it mocks a bit the American dream showing all this perfect families living in lovely houses in the suburbs not knowing a serial killer walks among them and what Blake searches is exactly that, the American dream, the perfect family, the house with the picket fence and so on. Overall ,the Stepfather is an entertaining, fast-paced and well directed thriller that you will most likely enjoy.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful and Imaginative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of the painfully predictable and highly impotent "Sleeping with the Enemy" came a far more suspenseful and imaginative feature in the form of the somewhat eerie thriller "The Stepfather". The story concerns a rather obsessed, or perhaps possessed, man who resorts to murdering families that 'disappoint him'. After moving in with fatherless young families, he would attempt to mould them according to how he believed they should be. However, when it became clear he was failing to achieve his ideals, rationale would go out the window, and out would come the meat cleaver! As the 'father knows best' nut case, Terry O'Quinn is admirable and at times quite chilling. Shelley Hack is his new wife who believes that Jerry is a godsend, while Jill Schoelen makes a cute, sexy teenage step-daughter who is very dubious about Jerry's authenticity and motives.Writers Carolyn Leftcourt, Brian Garfield and Donald E. Westlake have developed a very clever, innovative premise which perhaps could have become a classic psychological thriller given more detailed character development and a little more subtlety. This does not eventuate however, due to Westlake's routine screenplay and director Ruben's tendency to opt for the cheap, easy thrill. Patrick Moraz supplies a rather unsuitable, clumsy soundtrack that just doesn't work.To say that "The Stepfather" doesn't entertain would be untrue though. On the level it chooses to operate from, the picture is indeed effective, but by no means is it a classic of the genre. "Fatal Attraction" it is not!Sunday, July 16, 1995 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best Horror/Thriller movies i have seen in a long time and the movies about a man who is looking for the perfect family and he will kill to get it.I was surprised to find the actor Terry O'Quinn (from the good TV show lost) was in this movie playing the Stepfather and the movie stars other actors and actress like Jill Schoelen,Shelley Hack,Charles Lanyer,Stephen Shellen and Stephen E. Miller.In the movie there are heaps of good gore scenes like when the Stepfather is trying to sell a house to a man but the man makes him angry so he beats the man to death with a block of wood and the scene in the end of the movie is good.Over all this movie is a must see and u should buy it if $15 or less and my rating is 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a horde of dumb slasher movies out there with scenes of horrific gore and preadolescent wisecracks that somehow finds an audience that is both thrilled and amused. (The audience members should all take MMPIs and be sure to leave their limbic systems to science.)This isn't quite like that. I won't bother repeating the story. The movie does have two scenes of violence and blood, and both of them are unexpected and shocking, but there's more to it than that. The characters are more complex than the usual dull teens who tease each other about zits and have their brassieres cut off by flailing hatchets, possibly because the principals are adults. One is Shelly Hack, who is pretty but doesn't need to act. The other adult is Terry O'Quinn without whose performance this movie wouldn't be what is is. He's a real estate salesman who adores healthy families. That bland and putrid smile fits both attributes. He makes cracks too, at times of violence, but they're ironic as well as stupid. He bashes some nosey parker to death and before pushing him off a cliff in one of those cars that always explodes, he fastens the body's seat belt, advising it, "Buckle up for safety." After murdering another guy who has surprised him at home, O'Quinn stands over the body and says, "Next time call before dropping over, Jim." O'Quinn has two modalities of expression -- 95 percent tepid bourgeois and 5 percent enraged grizzly bear. He's always happiest when saying grace before Thanksgiving dinner, or hugging his wife and daughter so the neighbors can take pictures of them grinning together. But the bear is always there, rumbling and crashing about through the inner brush, and there are times when O'Quinn ("Jerry Blake," could anyone pick a better name?) needs to let off a little steam and goes down to the basement workshop and starts growling loudy to himself about how we need a little order around here! He paces back and forth, occasionally loosing a volley of curses and smashing tools around.I don't want to make too much of this, but that basement is "his" room. It's where he builds an elaborate birdhouse which he sets up in the front yard. He stares admiringly up at the wretched thing and remarks how it sure will be nice to get a bird family in there. (He's already got his birds in a much bigger house.) I liked the idea of that birdhouse, sawed down at the end. I also appreciate the fact that the writer didn't bother to give O'Quinn any buried motive for his serial lives. We learn nothing of his past, and that's just as well, because any attempt at an explanation would cheapen the story.His daughter, Jill Schoelen, however, escapes O'Quinn's clutches, at least for a time, in the attic. (The attic is "her" sanctuary, see.) This is at the climax of the movie when it has already deteriorated thoroughly into a routine slasher scene. O'Quinn has already socked Hack and knocked her unconscious down the stares and now begins to stalk Schoelen, bloody knife in hand. Schoelen is a pretty, innocent, teenage girl who is nude and is taking a shower. All helpless female victims take showers and hide in dark rooms. A chase ensues, in the course of which -- let me count the ways -- O'Quinn gets stabbed through the brachial artery with a big slice of broken mirror, takes two bullets in the back, crashes through the floor down to the hallway beneath, tumbles down a flight of stairs once, or maybe twice, and is finally stabbed in the heart with a butcher knife before expiring with a puzzled look on his face, Rasputin the Mad Monk. The location shooting is evocative. Late Fall in the Pacific Northwest, erythritic trees frame the figures, shrubs are the color of goldenrod or gorse, the street appropriately rain slick and the skies suitably gray, until after O'Quinn is dispatched, when the sun finally breaks out of its prison.I wish the ending hadn't been so weak and ill-thought-out. Cripes, there's even a scene of a would-be rescuer racing his car towards the house, hoping to get there in time to prevent the final slaughter (which he has no idea is imminent). And he experiences the usual interruptions that slow him down -- including a school-crossing guard with a hand-held stop sign who permits a parade of nuns to plod slowly across the intersection while the driver pounds the steering wheel, muttering, "Come on, Come ON." (I swear I'm not making that up.)It's O'Quinn's character that makes the movie, though. He has a good scene at a backyard party when someone hands him a newspaper account of a family that was butchered a year earlier (by O'Quinn himself under another identity), asking why the papers should bring all that up again. O'Quinn says, "I don't think I ever heard about that," and he reads the item solemnly as if truly fascinated. A guest asks how any man could kill his own family. Without changing expression or looking up, O'Quinn says, "Maybe they disappointed him." He plays the scene very well, not even making it clear that he remembers the incident. He could so easily have overplayed it -- the fleeting scowl, the furtive glance at the others -- right out of a high school play, but instead he keeps it straight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ORDER!!! ORDER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies with a campy premise that thrives to make the grade. It starts out so well, with decent characters that you might not fully care about, but on the other hand you aren't annoyed by them. Terry O'Quinn is given a role that challenges the audience to take pity on his madness even while disgusted and frightened by him. The writers on the other hand, they could use a nice thick chunk of plywood against the head. The climax lets all the air out of a movie that started to build itself steadily. (Hmm.. let me take a really long time getting my gun here, even though I was preparing myself for this moment for a whole year. Hey Mom are you home? Oh never mind, I'll just take a shower to show off my underaged body for no good reason whatsoever) To be frankly honest I actually did enjoy Jill Schoelen's guilty pleasurable performance and THE STEPFATHER is enjoyable to make fun of. I just wish there were more juicy moments like when O'Quinn stops in his homicidal tracks and asks himself, "Oh, wait a minute. Who am I here?" He also does a dandy impression of Mr. Ed. THE STEPFATHER, overall, is perfect midnight viewing. Just rent something smarter along with it to handle your craving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stepfather starts as a man named Henry Morrison (Terry O'Quinn) leaves his home for the last time, a home in which his wife &amp; children lie dead after he had killed them earlier. After travelling to a new town he now calls himself Jerry Blake &amp; has found a new job as a real estate agent, Jerry has also found himself a new family. Jerry has married widow Susan Maine (Shelley Hack) but is having problems with her daughter Stephanie (Jill Schoelen) who resents Jerry &amp; even has an intense dislike of him. After reading about the murdered family in a nearby town Stephanie becomes suspicious, especially after witnessing Jerry lose his temper on several occasions &amp; decides to investigate further. Jerry becomes aware of Stephanie's suspicions &amp; starts to realise that his 'perfect' family is falling apart, eventually Jerry decides he has to start again fresh &amp; that he has to dispose of his current disappointing family...This British &amp; American co-production was directed by Joseph Ruben &amp; seems to be considered a bit of a classic in some circles, I must admit that I have no idea why &amp; thought The Stepfather was a throughly average film. It's quite hard to define The Stepfather within the confines of one genre, I was expecting a slasher style horror film but The Stepfather is probably more a psycho thriller in the vein of Fatal Attraction (1987) which was released the same year. Like it's big budget Hollywood blockbuster The Stepfather hinges on family values &amp; just how important they are to us, in the case of Jerry Blake he will literally kill for the perfect family &amp; the idyllic existence that we are all brought up to aspire to, while Fatal Attraction places emphasis on it's family life with Michael Douglas doing all he can to salvage it &amp; that it should be cherished &amp; respected The Stepfather goes in the other direction &amp; weaves it's story around the idea that family values are outdated &amp; the perfect family simply does not exist &amp; trying to attain it will only end in tears &amp; misery. While the two films take opposite opinions I think the truth lies somewhere between the two, there's nothing wrong with traditional family life but at the same time it's near impossible for things to be completely perfect. At just over 80 minutes long The Stepfather moves along at a fairly sedate pace, while it's not boring it's hardly exciting either. The character's are alright if a little dumb at times &amp; there's a real lack of slasher conventions until the final ten minutes in which we get a knife wielding maniac, a gratuitous shower scene &amp; a final girl who defeats the bad guy after a chase. The Stepfather is competently written, plotted &amp; it's alright to watch but I don't really understand the great reputation it has, I thought it was strictly average &amp; I wouldn't want to see it again any time soon.The Stepfather looks alright, it has no great visual style but it's well made I suppose. Those looking for gore &amp; novelty killings should stick with the likes of The Nightmare on Elm Street &amp; Friday the 13th franchises &amp; there's very little here. A guy is beaten with a plank of wood, a couple of dead bodies are seen, someone is shot &amp; stabbed in the arm &amp; that's about it. The script was apparently based loosely on the case of John List who killed in family in 1971 &amp; remained on the run until 1989.Supposedly filmed in 40 days in Washington &amp; in British Columbia in Canada on what must have been a fairly low budget The Stepfather has good production values. The acting is alright, I keep reading how great Terry O'Quinn is in the role but I was less impressed, sure he's fine but I didn't enjoyed his performance particularly.The Stepfather is a film with a great reputation &amp; strong following but I must admit to being somewhat baffled by what people see in it, sure it's not terrible but I didn't think it was anything great either. Followed by Stepfather II (1989), Stepfather III (1992) &amp; a more recent Hollywood remake The Stepfather (2009).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Dream Becomes The American Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than 20 years before portraying a paraplegic marooned on a "Lost" island and possessed by a homicidal Smoke Monster, actor Terry O'Quinn played a homicidal monster of a far more mundane sort, in Joseph Ruben's 1987 masterwork "The Stepfather." Inspired by the true-life story of John List, who executed his family of five in Westfield, NJ in 1971 and remained uncaught, with a new identity, for 18 years, the film transplants its action to the Puget Sound area. When we first meet "Henry Morrison," he is washing the blood off his hands following the murder of his entire family. A year later, he has changed his look, his name is now Jerry Blake, and he has married into another family's home. His new wife, Susan (Shelley Hack, who is perfectly fine here, although I never had much use for her in "Charlie's Angels"), just adores him, but his pretty 16-year-old stepdaughter, Stephanie (a surprisingly excellent performance here from Jill Schoelen), homes right in on the fact that there's something slightly amiss with her new stepdad. Although Ruben's film shares some themes with Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" (1943), here, there is NO doubt whatever as to the psychopathic nature of the lead character. The picture's suspense comes in knowing that Blake is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off, and O'Quinn makes the man's rages and violent outbursts truly frightening to behold, culminating in a final 20 minutes that the Master of Suspense might well have looked on in approbation. Let me put it clearly: I just loved this movie. Filled with impeccable performances, gorgeous photography of the autumnal Vancouver landscape, a terrific script that is laced with subtle humor (such as when Jerry tells Stephanie "Father knows best"), references to Hitchcock films (in addition to "Shadow of a Doubt," there are nods to "Psycho," as in that shot of Jerry with a stuffed bird behind his head, and to "The Birds" itself) and, as I mentioned, remarkable suspense, the picture really might be what "The Psychotronic Video Guide" has called it: "one of the best horror films of the '80s." All I know is, Terry gives a truly unsettling, Oscar-calibre performance in this, his breakthrough role; a performance that almost makes us feel sympathy for this monster, who is only seeking to attain his perfect family and slice of the American dream. In this case, sadly, that dream has become quite a nightmare indeed....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After murdering his entire family, a man remarries a widow with a teenage daughter in another town and prepares to do it all over again. A family-values man named Jerry Blake marries widows and divorcées with children in search of the perfect family. As soon as his new family members show signs of being human and not robots who will march unquestioningly to his tune, his dreams of domestic bliss begin to crumble, and he kills them. Then he alters his appearance, assumes a new identity, and skips to another town to begin the deadly ritual all over again. He marries Susan Maine, who sees him as the ideal surrogate father for her teenage daughter Stephanie, and he is soon up to his old tricks when she proves to be too much of a troublesome teen to handle. Roger Ebert wrote "Like many movies that study psychopathic killers ("Badlands," "In Cold Blood" (1968), even "Black Widow"), this film seems to have no larger purpose than simply to show us the killer. Because the murderer is mentally ill, because he is not killing out of any motive that we can understand, the film is simply an exercise in despair; a portrait of a tragic man. Violence itself seems to sell at the box office, even when it's divorced from any context. Maybe that's what the filmmakers were thinking. What often happens, though, is that in an otherwise flawed film there are a couple of things that are wonderful. "The Stepfather" has one wonderful element: Terry O'Quinn's performance." Quite a piece of acting by Terry O'Quinn. He's a salesman and he sells himself as a family man. Even more, he actually is a family man and tries to create the perfect family. His psychosis is focused on that single notion, and that is indeed how some psychoses work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it slips into tacky territory at times - a very '80s score; one of the most gratuitous nude scenes I've ever seen - 'The Stepfather' is surprisingly effective and solidly put together. It ain't subtle, but it works and it's been bumping around in my mind since I saw it a few days ago. It's a grower, I think. Terry O'Quinn is convincing as an unhinged charmer whose attempts to create the perfect, wholesome family have previously ended in bloodshed (the opening scene is genuinely stunning and sets up the movie's stall in a memorable way, to say the least). Now he's inveigling his way into the lives of a widow and her daughter, and we bite our nails as a face from his past tries to catch up with him.The movie gets more schlocky as it goes along, but its plot is surprising and involving, cranks up the tension at key junctures and zips through its runtime without ever outstaying its welcome. I'm gearing up for a second viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry O'Quinn, Jill Schoelen and Shelley Hack star in this 1987 thriller. This begins during Christmas time with a mysterious man (O'Quinn) changing his identity and leaving his home after brutally murdering his family. A year later, we meet teenage girl, Stephanie Maine (Schoelen) and her mother, Susan (Hack) who live with the man who now calls himself, Jerry Blake. Jerry works as a real-estate agent who longs for the perfect family, but it becomes difficult when Stephanie and others get in his way discovering he's not who he seems. This is a good 80's thriller with a good cast and O'Quinn is especially great in it. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before 1960, horror generally beckoned from places unmapped, from a little outside the common sphere of rationale and knowledge. We either traveled to them as in the Dracula mythos or as in Cat People their curse seeped back, nevertheless the boundaries were well defined. Here was home, where fear may occasionally intrude but is nevertheless dispelled by some understanding of its supernatural mechanism, and beyond was the unspeakable. Even when that unspeakable was found in the suburbs of Los Angeles, as in the case of House on Haunted Hill, the otherworldly architecture was a clear signifier of the threshold that separates the two worlds.Psycho changed all that. Now the dark, threatening world was a short drive away and the monster was the motel owner next door - meaning it's never quite dispelled, and could be each of us next. The vision was so startling it turned Gothic horror overnight into a semi-parodic anachronism. Eight years later Romero carried the idea to its revealing extreme - now the fabric of the world entire was chaos pulling at the seams and we were forced to barricade inside the mind. The idea was no longer to restore balance and eventually make good triumph, rather to simply survive and maintain sanity in spite of the terror. It resonated with people growing up in a world of random, inexplicable yet sensationalized violence close and far from home, whose true essence is so hopelessly removed from our immediate understanding that we can merely fumble in the dark as we retreat from it. In its own way, it situated us back into the spooky castle or mansion, only now there was nowhere to hide from it - the entire world is the monster's den.Now, The Stepfather goes the extra mile from Psycho. The monster is not simply disguised among us, it is the very figurehead of the household who is furthermore responsible for upholding the values that define social life. The ogre-father in Freudian terms, but also as arbiter of ethos. It is to some degree a successful venture for the reversal alone.Why it's not important in the grand scheme as Psycho or Night of the Living Dead, perhaps has to do with so much contrivance in the plotting. It's never quite so believable as it should be. And it's played with so much relish that the closest film I kept thinking of was not so much Psycho, as American Psycho. The psychotic person so peculiarly enjoyable in his frenzy that it's rendered a parody of the real thing. An Ed Gein who has seeped so deep into the cultural mainstream that he has been allowed, in part, to be deprived of the reality that could foster such a human being. It doesn't so much scare or scar with life, as passingly titillate.And it's so parodic I think, because audiences by now were so accustomed to the very idea of a father menacing his own family that it doesn't move like it might have at one time. It is acceptable to be the subject of gleeful fun. Slashers and zombie films followed the same path, becoming increasingly ironic of the terror they posited. Having made our peace with it, we could now make some fun of what is beyond the pale.It is not a bad film by any means. It could have been much more though. Watch it, if you've done the rounds of the genre and are now looking into the second-tier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stepfather is pretty typical 80's horror film without any bigger surprises for the genre fans. But thankfully it's not from the worst part of the town as a film and the plot line and the acting carries through the film without any bigger problems.The film has pretty effective start, when we see Terry O'Quinn, the stepfather, leaving the remains of his late butchered family behind him, after he's on his way to find a new family to attach himself to. The identity of the murderer is not the issue or the secret of the film, as we know it all along. The tension is build towards the moment of his another breakdown towards his murderous spree.The plot line works quite good and the grim one liners are pretty effective and funny. There are only couple of things which drag the film down a bit: one is the music, which is pretty typical 80's half synthesized pop and another is pretentious acting in many of the "happy family, happy friends etc." scenes of the film. Over all I'd say, even tough predictable, still pretty effective horror/thriller film.</fullReview>

The Hidden comes to mind as a real standout.The Stepfather is not in that league, but it has its moments.It gets a good start with a script by Donald Westlake, whose book `The Hunter' became `Point Blank' in the movies, then more recently remade as ?Payback' with Mel Gibson. The Grifters was also his.It has the perfunctory male psycho-lead (Terry O'Quinn, of Millennium and X-Files), the ?can she really be this in the dark' blonde wife (Shelley Hack---type casting at its finest), and Jill Schoelen as the cute little step-daughter with that something extra?All way above average.Nice two by four scene?but don't let me give it all away.

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite horror movies.The movie has a unique,original concept. Terry O'Quinn gives a terrific performance and makes what could of been a one dimensional villain,a well rounded character who feels like a real person. The other supporting actors such as Schoelen and Hack though overshadowed by Quinn,also give good performances and manage to make their characters likable. The pacing is good and never feels too short or too long. The movie does a good job building up to Blakes breaking point and leads to a exciting climax and the movie is overall well written. It is a shame that this flick did not catch on and will always be just a cult movie-in my own opinion I rather watch The stepfather any day of the week over all of the Friday the 13th movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This father knows best for his 'dream' family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry is Stephanie's new stepfather, but there's something about him she just doesn't quite like. All that the always happy and loving Jerry wants is the perfect family and he'll do anything to keep it that way? anything. Stephanie Maine is making it real hard for him and when she witnesses him losing it in the basement one day. She starts suspecting that there's something more about him and tries to dig deeper into this hidden past. But disappointment is seeking into Jerry's mind and now he might be on the look out for a new American dream? the 'perfect' family.Now I can see why many who have seen it call this under-the-radar thriller an unheralded winner. I myself found it to be very good in manipulative sense, but wasn't hugely won over by it and it left me feeling a little underwhelmed after it finished. A little. This psycho-thriller is mostly well written, confidently acted and ably directed with enough panache, but its familiar tone feels like its never going to get going with its meandering narrative. Also there's a sub-plot that seems to work up to nothing much. Anyhow I guess who could say that they were giving the characters and the situation enough time to evolve into what you can call a sweaty 10 minutes of breakneck tension. Director Joseph Ruben likes to suggest more so than illuminate to begin with. When doing so he creates a rather unsettling vibe from this psychological imprint, but when he goes visual on the thrills. His sure handling of the material makes sure of some productively violent jolts that get the heart pounding.Looking at the film, the minor budget shows up prominently, as at times it emits a TV movie image. Although gladly it doesn't hamper things and even clichés get a good work over, but somehow we forgive that because of the audacity drummed out by the actors and director. Patrick Moraz's broodingly jittery music score sets the mood in every scene extremely well and John Lindley's nimbly polished cinematography is simply crafted with great detail and care to invoke a certain feeling. Even Ruben's uniform pacing is played out naturally and rather well timed. The boldly tight script by Donald E. Westlake has an authentically clever touch to its depiction of an artificial suburbia (and the American dream like portrayed on old TV soaps) that lurks only skin deep and streaming through it is wickedly dark sense of humour that effectively complements its subversive nature. This father is living the past, where this ideal family values of this clean image of home sweet home no longer suits this modern way of life and has long expired its use-by date from what we see now.A believable Quinn is bewitchingly clean-cut in appearance, but the unnervingly dominated tone underneath the fake shell spells that of a brilliant two-faced performance, where the compulsive shifts in behaviour are precisely achieved. From be it, a simple stare, his persuasive nature or brutally insane tenancies. He truly gets into his character and the way he goes about it only proves so. Great stuff! The lovely Jill Shoelen also deserves to be put on the same pedestal, as she's capably outstanding in drawing us into her troubles that we truly feel for her brave-heart character. Shelley Hack pleasantly plays the love-swept mother Susan Maine.While it didn't entirely do it for me, it's still hard not to respect an extremely solid and well-dissected foray into formulaic territory. Maybe it'll take me another viewing, as the more I seem think about it now, the more it seems to grow on me. Go figure. Terry O' Quinn's sublimely underling dark edged performance alone makes it a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable all the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as the movie started, I hoped it would not be as predictable as I feared it was going to be. Unfortunately, it was. It was like an old mold was used, as the whole storyline never surprised or added something new. Well, it saves me from writing a long review I guess.Though somehow still slightly entertaining (hence my 4 points instead of lower), the movie didn't only lack of originality, but also of any sort of depth. Never do we get to know Jerry better, nor do we get to know the family better. There's no real character development, no real deep emotions, just nothing that makes it stand out. Some people describe it as a satire, which it could have been, if only there would have been more sharpness to it. Instead, I think I only smiled once, but it was more like a slight curl of my lips than a real smile. So to keep it short as promised, I did sit through the 90 minutes and was entertained enough not to search for an other unseen movie in my collection, but that's about it. If you do not mind a predictable thriller, and you like the lack of any real tension, well it might just be something for you. If you are used to movies that keep you on the edge of your seat, skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>strictly low rent thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry O'Quinn plays one of the more colorful psychopaths to appear on the screen in recent memory, a perfect husband and family man whose house is always in perfect order, with only one detail out of place: the mutilated bodies of the wife and kids he just murdered. The character's history of periodic serial killing is supposed to reflect the rotten core of the American Dream, but underneath the sociological pretensions is a routine slasher movie, written with tongue-in-cheek humor (says O'Quinn to his suspicious new stepdaughter, "honey, let's bury the hatchet") and punctuated by moments of appalling and gratuitous brutality. The film presents something of a paradox: a cynical and sadistic little thriller meant to be enjoyed as escapist entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stories of wicked stepmothers have graced cinema and literature for years, so the fact that this one follows a wicked stepfather gives it some sort of originality; or at least it would, if there hadn't already been a lot of films about male interlopers disrupting the family unit. However, despite the fact that we've seen it all before; The Stepfather manages its plot with panache and the linear way that the plot plays out ensures that the film is very easy to like. Like the central character; the support cast isn't very original either, as we've got the mother who's hung up on her new husband, and the daughter that doesn't like him. The characterisation on display is nothing to write home about, but again both characters are easy to like; and there definitely is a pattern emerging, as this is a film that is happy to wallow in its derision, and makes good of it. As expected, the plot follows a man who sees family values above all else. When his new family; mother and daughter Susan and Stephanie begin to disappoint him, his conscience doesn't get in the way of him doing what he does best...The film benefits from a great leading performance by Terry O'Quinn. His role is one of the main reasons why the film is more than just another take on a familiar idea. O'Quinn is suitably creepy throughout and while his character verges on comic book villainy in comparison to the rest of the film, he does manage to bring believability to the role. The movie feels very much like it was made for television, but in a way this helps to establish the suburban layout of the film; as it could well be another family drama. The horror of the tale creeps in through the idea of not being able to fully trust anyone; and director Joseph Ruben manages to implement a keen sense of paranoia into the piece. The whole thing boils down to an absolutely great conclusion, which manages to offset a few cliché's at the same time as taking in all the themes of the story and dishing out comeuppance to the leading characters. There are some great scenes in this movie; my absolute favourite being the one that sees a rampaging Terry O'Quinn burst through a mirror! This may not be the most ingenious film ever made, but its lots of fun, well written and easy to like; and on the whole, I say that it deserves its cult status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>much better than it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as DeNiro was born to play Travis Bickle, Terry O'Quinn found the role of his lifetime as Jerry Blake in the Stepfather series. I'm not comparing him to Deniro. I would never do that. O'Quinn just isn't that good of an actor, honestly. But he really shines in these movies. It's like they were written with him in mind. I wouldn't say the Step movies are "cult hits" exactly. I mean, people watched them, but nobody was out looking for them. They were a product of that time in the 80's when everybody was hitting the local VHS rental store 3 times a week. Everybody I know who saw the Stepfather movies picked them up after they had already used up the entire horror section &amp; were left with a choice of this or Night of the Bloody Apes. I know it doesn't sound like it, but I'm trying to give this movie (and the whole series) a great review. It's awesome. Seriously. It's amazing that a movie with nothing going for it could end up being this good. It's the kind of movie that makes you give yourself secret cool points for having liked it for so long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Popular and entertaining slasher flick from the late 80's that follows a serial killer who marries rich widows to later kill them and get the inheritance.This is a typical slasher flick with great performances by favorite 80's actor Terry O'Quinn and the marvelous, sexy, beautiful Jill Schoelen who is a clever daughter and won't let her mother die in the hands of the bastard stepfather.The death scenes are regular and do not offer many blood but still deliver .I recommend this movie only for fans of straight slasher movies because otherwise, you won't even give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a not-so-good movie with a fantastic lead performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Stepfather were told the story of a very particular kind of serial killer. It's the kind one might have found back in the town that Hitchcock set his Shadow of a Doubt, and his leading man as villain in Joseph Cotten as a man going around killing lonely old women is replaced here by Terry O'Quinn as a guy who simply takes up shop in families where the father's dead or gone and the wife needs a good fatherly presence to make the familial unit complete. So when Jerry Blake (formerly a Mr. Harrison or other, doesn't matter which really) married widowed Susan Blaine, her daughter (Jill Schoelen) isn't too happy. There's something just... off about him she can't quite pinpoint, which she also tells her therapist. But this doesn't stop her from acting out, and getting expelled from high school (in an almost pointless scene except to make her unsympathetic and set up a bland plot point), and it's something Jerry will just have to work a little harder at, to keep the family unit together.... or else! There's nothing too special about the plot here, and only a few scenes (perhaps those meant to be really thrilling, or perhaps not) really stick out as being exciting or interesting. The rest are a series of either dull/blandly acted or just over-the-top moments where everyone aside from Terry O'Quinn does there best to act but, gosh-darnit, none of them can. Maybe this has less to do with the screenwriter, late novelist Donald E. Westlake, and more to do with the director Joseph Ruben, who would a few years later make The Good Son, another contrived 'I'm-just-a-normal-face' killer movie. I imagine if you turned it on in a scene with, say, the mother and the daughter talking, or even that intrepid young man who is out to avenge his sister and has the funny last name and fast car, you might not think to keep watching past five minutes.Ruben's only real invention here to make things really watchable, and sometimes fantastic, is the casting of O'Quinn. For those who know him just from Lost as Locke (and you know who you are, such as myself), it's a treat and a half - he plays it just right in the calm 'normal' scenes, and then goes to town in taking this guy 'Jerry Blake' into another dimension of nuts. Just a simple facial expression after Jerry freaks out about his step-daughter's kiss with another boy is priceless. So if you must watch the movie watch it for him, or, perhaps, for the kind of guilty pleasure one has when watching, to give an equivalent idea of competent-crap of this year, Obsessed (not to be confused with the upcoming remake).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I the only person who thinks this movie was atrocious? I just saw thisfor the first time on cable. The only reason I watched it is because Terry O' Quinn, currently of "Lost" fame, was in it. I thought it would be interesting to see him in something much earlier.The problem lies not in his performance but in the terrible writing, and the wretched score. With a better script, O' Quinn could have really mined his character and shown us the layers to his insanity. Instead we are given a two note performance - creepily fake stepdad and totally crazy stepdad. A rather weak effort from Hack has as its only highlight a great slap across her daughter's face about 30 minutes before the end. Schaekel fares a little better as the daughter although she too seems limited due to the insipid lines she was given.I usually love bad, campy movies but this was just wretched. The whole thing has the feel of an 80s detective TV drama. I can't believe there were actually two sequels made...I can't even imagine how terrible those must be.A friend recently told me he loves this movie because in the 80s when he was in the navy and stationed in the middle of nowhere in Scotland, this was the only movie they had on tape so they watched it incessantly...unimaginable....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but reasonably well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing and reading a number of good reviews for this movie, I set out to watch it, but finding the movie was difficult. Video stores no longer stocked it, and it took me several years of poking around until I found a used copy at a thrift store.Did the movie deserve those good reviews? Well, the good stuff first. I don't think I have to add any more praise for Terry O'Quinn's performance to what's already been said in these reviews and IMDb user comments. He is indeed effective in the calmer scenes and those scenes where his true menace comes out. I also liked the fact that his character was written to be very smart (though not 100% perfect) - this made his character more chilling, since a smart menace is more frightening than a dumb one. The screenplay and direction have a number of subtle touches that help keep your interest. The violent sequences are more realistic than you usually get in a movie like this.But the movie is not perfect. Here are the bad things about it. I thought the electronic musical score was not only too '80s, but intrusive at times - many creepy scenes would have worked better with subdued or no music at all. I also thought it hard to believe that O'Quinn's character could be settled in a new life (with a new family) in just a year. (Two years maybe... but ONE year?) Also, there's somewhat less focus on O'Quinn's character than you may think. Showing more of this character - his needs and wants, his struggles, etc. - would have been more interesting (and add a more creepy feel to the movie, I suspect.) Still, the movie is worth seeing overall. I don't regret the buck I spent to buy my copy. And I'm pretty sure that this movie will turn out to be a lot better than the upcoming remake. A sign that the remake will be a stinker is the fact it's being released by Sony's Screen Gems distribution arm. Just look up Screen Gems movies on this web site, and you'll see why this is not a promising sign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incorrectly classified as a slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stepfather" is an incorrectly classified slasher with a few good points.**SPOILERS**During their relationship, Stephanie Maine, (Jill Schoelen) is still upset her stepfather, Jerry Blake, (Terry O'Quinn) has replaced her recently deceased father. As this leads to continuous struggles in school, her and her mother Susan, (Shelley Hack) battle over what to do with her in the meantime. As police detective Jim Ogilvie, (Stephen Shellen) struggling with unable to put away a year-old homicide case, decides to investigate it again and hope to finally get some closure on it. The trail leads back to him, and he tries to keep her from discovering the truth, claiming to want a perfect normal family. Still unable to shake the feeling that something is wrong, she investigates more and comes across his terrifying past, which he tries hard to keep it that way.The Good News: There isn't a whole lot to the film. The film's central premise is simply spectacular. This is a marvelously original view and has a great slant that provides plenty of potential for creepiness. The reasoning behind the madness is really off-settling, being a really creative twist to the formula and is certainly something hardly ever offered up before. The main brutality of the attack in the house is a lot bigger than expected, as the sight of all the blows to the head are really fantastic, and with the way it's photographed of the last shot where it really blows to the head, it becomes all the greater because of this. The only other part of the film that works is the rather fun chase at the end. This takes place all over the upper portions of the house with all kinds of terrifying results, is non-stop action and completely entertains all the way through. Nothing is wrong with this, from the kills to the few amounts of blood offered in the defense moments, and with all great way it's set up, there's the potential for a lot to offer it. It's the main reason to see this, and the real reason for this one's ability to stay afloat.The Bad News: This one here is a really disappointing film, and most of that is due to the fact that it seems to be classified as a slasher rather than a thriller, which it really should be. There's nothing in here that is characteristic of a slasher film, since the body count is barely there, the few kills on display are barely worth talking about other than the one mentioned before, and it never once tries to elicit a feeling of constant terror from others before the stalking of the final girl. This one never tries to become a slasher, and instead of being called a thriller, which is based around the film's central gimmick and theme, this one tries to play with that rather than going for straight-out horror and all that's left is a feeling of boredom from those who expect a slasher. As a thriller, it isn't that bad, but it's still left with the fact that nothing even happens, and all that occurs before the finale is the attempts to hide the truth from those searching into the past, and these are rarely interesting. That makes this feel even more boring to those expecting a slasher, but when these events aren't that good to begin with, it lowers it to the other fans, leaving this one feeling down even more.The Final Verdict: While this one doesn't feel much like the slasher it's classified as, as a thriller it isn't that spectacular either. Thriller fans who aren't too discerning should give this a try, while those expecting a slasher will really find this one underwhelming.Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence and Full Nudity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spoiler alert!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About fifteen minutes into `The Stepfather', the memory of two labeled as classical thrillers leaped into my mind and stayed there until the movie was over. The two films were `Straw Dogs' and `The Shining'. The first one is a fairly complex character-study of a mugged-by-hillbillies-pacifist who goes very far in maintaining his carefully drafted self-image. The paradox is that, in the end, he'll even resort to violence in order to keep that image sustained. The latter is a rather shallow thriller about what director Kubrick himself called `the story of a family quietly going insane together'. Visually stunning, but Kubrick didn't quite manage to create psychological tension.Like said, `The Stepfather' contains obvious echoes of both films and I couldn't help but compare it with those two. It contains both the self-image element from `Straw Dogs' and the demented-father-who-eventually wants to kill his family-element from `The Shining'. Comparing it with the latter, `the Stepfather' has a lot of winning elements that were missing (and were missed) in that film: subtlety and mounting psychological suspense, neatly underlined by a couple of around-the-dinner-table scenes.The echoes of `Straw Dogs' don't do `The Stepfather' any good, though, because it tends to over-exaggerate the self-image part of the story. Jerry wants to see himself as the father of a picture perfect family. He wants to see his family (including himself) as clearly labeled items, stereotypes: the faithful housewife-mother; the daughter who won't have a boyfriend until she's, say, 35, and performs well in school. Oh, and don't forget the puppy. If they do disappoint him, he doesn't apply for a divorce (he's so old fashioned) but just kills them off and searches nearby cities for another widow with teenage kids (no crying baby at three A.M. for Jerry). The movie starts with Jerry just having killed his 'former' family and moving in with Susan and her rebellious teenage daughter, Stephanie. Jerry has great difficulties winning the girl over, but even when he finally manages to achieve this, things don't go well for long because Jerry is a time-bomb, bound to go off. As said, Jerry is a rather old fashioned guy. Here we have a guy killing all the time to maintain his self-image, which seems to be inspired mainly by the unrealistic family sitcoms. He clings, not unlike the Brady Bunch in their two movies, to an era that is gone. He watches Mr. Ed reruns; he builds paper hats for kids; he doesn't seem to enjoy sex; and he tries to solve problems saying corny things like `Things look better in the morning' and even `Father knows best' (need I say more?). Unfortunately, you don't get the feeling that things are meant tongue in cheek.The film has more flaws. The character of Lanyen, brother of the previous victim, had been abroad for quite a while and the news of his sister and her family being killed took more than six months to reach him. When he comes back in Seattle, he's determined to find Jerry and stop him before he kills another family. He first contacts a reporter to do another article on Jerry. If possible with picture, but the paper's editor refuses the last request so when the article reaches Jerry and his surroundings, they don't suspect a thing. Okay, let's summarize: a supposedly friendly, upper middle class family man suddenly kills off his entire family before vanishing into thin air...that's quite something. I guess Geraldo and the likes of him would have a field day with this. Even if that wouldn't have been the case, wouldn't you think that, although the editor refuses this time around, at the time the same newspaper did publish some articles with photo(s) on the event? In the world of this movie the answer is no. The police didn't do much of a job, either. Lanyen goes on investigating things himself; an investigation that is rather shallow and consists mostly of eventually going in the house of his murdered sister and finding a 'beautiful houses around Seattle' magazine with a couple of pages torn out (guess what: the missing pages, found back in a library copy of the magazine, reveal the exact location of where Jerry has started a new family). The police wasn't up to this?! Near the end of the movie, Jerry decides to kill off his new family and already starts a search for a new one in a nearby town.(a very creepy scene, by the way, in which he flirts with a shy widow). He uses a rather neat disguise on this trip. Obviously, he must have done the same thing with lanyen's sister; deciding to kill the family and starting to flirt with Susan in a nearby town. But what disguise did he use then? In the beginning of the film we see Jerry shaving off a full beard and mustache after he murdered Lanya's sister, so he MUST have flirted with Susan while having this beard and mustache (also meaning that if the papers really did place a picture of him in the papers, his new smooth-as-a-baby-butt appearance wouldn't have saved him from being recognized anyway). Maybe I'm being somewhat of a nitpicker here, but I tend to be when a movie having an obvious 'above the average crowd-pleasing thriller'-attitude contains elements that are clearly there just for the `Oh, my God!'-moment. (I recently saw director Ruben's `Sleeping with the enemy', which like no movie I've ever seen throws away credibility just for a few predictable cheap thrills)Besides the nice pace and Terry O' Quinn's performance, there are a few nice touches, like some of Jerry's dialogue: `I'm a believer in lost cases', he tells Stephanie's school principle who has expelled her. After killing off Stephanie's shrink, who was on to him, and making it look like an accident, Jerry finally is allowed to hug her and as he does so, he tells her: `In his own special way, he brought us closer together'. And, near the end, the film reminded me of a third classic thriller, `Blue Velvet': behind the facade of picket fences, neighborhood barbecues and friendly chatter, a father is killing his family in broad daylight and no-one reacts to their screams. But, nevertheless, the final is still kind of a let down as Jerry slowly wanders the suddenly darkened house while slinging a knife, sneaking up on his teenage daughter Stephanie who's taking a shower while we get gratuitous nudity shots of her doing so; and, of course, it turns out to be almost impossible to stop Jerry: it takes numerous stabbings, several bullets and a fall from the basement floor before Jerry finally shuts his eyes (...and open them in the sequel...and the second sequel). 6 ? out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and quite funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I was expecting a really bad horror film but thanks to Terry O Quinn the movie is saved. O'Quinn is simultaneously creepy and hilarious. He stabs a man and then states 'you should call before you drop in.' I laughed! There is another vicious scene where he beats his wife with a phone. It comes so unexpectedly that I actually cringed. Which is unusual for me in horror films.Another funny scene is when O'Quinn takes his anger out on his tools. He rants, raves and beats up the basement. The actor is excellent at losing the plot and nutting off. It is damn funny but also unnerving and you are glad that you are not living with him. In a nod to the Shining, a superior film about another family with a psycho father. O'Quinn really hammers the door. O'Quinn really goes for it! That poor door. What a nut!A scene that sticks out to me is when the psychiatrist tricks Jerry into showing him a house. His questions are so obvious, they are questions only a psychiatrist would ask. He may as well resort to the old cliche of 'tell me about your mother.' Jerry goes nuts and kills the shrink but not before some hilarious dialogue from Jerry as he starts nutting off.The Stepfather is an eighties film that picks up on the collective, cultural anxiety at this time. The divorce rate was increasing and the nuclear family was changing. Conservatives were not happy about this. From the late 1970's onwards divorce had began to increase. People were deciding not to live in misery and were starting to do their own thing. The mother in the film is punished for finding a new man. I am not sure what she is meant to do exactly. Become a high profile lesbian perhaps? She is also punished for not having faith and believing in her family. Her family being her daughter in this case. This is what makes this film something of a teen flick. The teenage daughter is of course right about Jerry and becomes Nancy Drew. She investigates Jerry and ultimately kills him. She is the main protagonist in the film. It is a teenagers nightmare and Jill Schoelan is the heroine who can survive the madman. The film is the ultimate empowerment of the teenage girl.Jerry himself is obviously a conservative, right wing, family values, kind of guy. Jerry the psychotic republican. He should run for office. It is to bad that he is completely psychotic! Jerry could be a Ted Bundy that was never caught. There are some nice moments in the film from director Joseph Ruben who shows a scene where Jerry watches a family. This seemingly perfect family of wife, daughter and husband are a psychological schema for Jerry. To Jerry they represent the perfect and ideal family. However, this ideal can never live up to actual reality so Jerry will always kill his family for disappointing him. 'Maybe they disappointed him!' Jerry says with vehemence, when he see's an article in the local newspaper about the previous family that he murdered. These little details made me think that the director is not a complete hack.The film has some problems, the acting is bad from all. Even O'Quinn is pretty silly and sneers. Sneering, see he must be the bad guy! All the actors are really bad and wooden, most notably Schoelan. Scary Jerry has some sought of weird sexual attraction to her. The writing is also bad. There is a subplot of the most recent murdered family's brothers chasing Jerry and it goes absolutely nowhere. The plot is also horribly predictable and you will know what I mean when you watch it. Of course the daughter sees through Jerry's act. Of course she is a problem child that gets into trouble. Although she acts like a member of the Brady Bunch. You also have the 'burnt out journalist,' another character stereotype. You even have the token black guy who, as you guessed it, is 'the world weary, hard boiled' cop. AAARRRGHHH!!! Why can't writers just spend a little bit of time on their characters?The end is interesting. The little bird house, representing Jerry's ideal world, is on top of a large phallic bit of timber. The daughter cuts down the house. She has destroyed Jerry and this is symbolically destroying him by cutting down his manly phallic pole. His power has been exorcised. Jerry has fallen and now so has his psychotic ideals.Despite the film being completely obvious it is still enjoyable. You could do much worse when you choose a film from your horror section down at your local video store. I give this a 6 out of 10. What ever happened to Terry O'Quinn? He showed some real promise in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One good performance up against one poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performance of Terry O'Quinn is so superior over that of Shelly Hack that one almost feels like rooting for the bad guy i.e. The Stepfather at times because his wife (played by Hack) is so totally in the dark "Duh I'm just a dumb blonde who's in love" about the man she has married that she deserves what she almost gets in the end. The film has it's moments of suspense but lags at times and makes the viewer wonder "Is this guy really that slick or is everyone around him that stupid" Could have been better had another actress been selected to portray the wife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Trashes 'Family Values'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, this movie was pretty entertaining and Terry O'Quinn was fascinating to watch in the lead role. That's why I gave it five stars, because the content and bias deserved nothing.The message in this movie - and I am not exaggerating, folks - is that someone who espouses old-fashioned family values is nuts: in this case, a thoroughly-demented serial killer! Yup, to Liberal Hollywood, decency equates to insanity while perversion equals good. Having watched tons of movies, I wasn't shocked at this message but I was shocked how blatant it was presented. I mean, have a little tact! What Hollywood won't do to slam "family values."Supposedly, this movie was "based" on a guy who killed his prior family and then remarried before getting caught. However, be cautious when you see that word "based" because it might mean that only one percent of it involves the real facts of a case. You can bet the screenwriters added their PC bias.Anyway, O'Quinn carries the film, not just because he has the most interesting role, but he just does a great job with it, which I can't say for some of the females in here. Supporting actors-aside, this would have been a better movie had the filmmakers' agenda hadn't been so obvious. Don't kid yourself: this story wasn't about some serial killer, it was all about Liberals slamming people who advocate some family morals. It was all about getting in yet more Left Wing propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does everyone like this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read countless reviews lavishing praise on The Stepfather, but frankly, I found it to be a thoroughly mediocre film. An interesting premise is bungled, the direction is flat, and the cinematography is so static and empty that it looks like it was shot on videotape. It has the appearance and feel of a TV commercial stretched out to feature length--a style employed by many 1980s movies.Terry O'Quinn is first-rate as the title character. He's very convincing and intense, even when mouthing stupid dialogue about happy families that would make anyone with half a brain cell realize that something is up. But even his considerable talents can't carry the movie, and he is soon defeated by the cliched script and crummy support. Jill Schoelen is annoying as the heroine, delivering all her lines in a smug, whiny voice that makes her sound like a refugee from Full House. Shelley Hack is her usual godawful self, displaying all the charm and talent of a JC Penney mannequin; during her sex scene, she seems more like someone who's just run up a long flight of stairs than someone in the throes of passion. Because O'Quinn is the only one who engages any emotions, I ended up on his side, hoping he would knock off his sappy, irritating family and end this vapid movie once and for all. You might want to see it for his strong performance, but everything and everyone else is completely dull. Proceed at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good little thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I have avoided seeing this movie for years. I simply was NOT interested in the premise (even though I LOVE slasher flicks), mostly because the film was recomended to me by dolts and imbeciles. However, I caved in to temptation last night and rented The Stepfather, and you know what? It's actually pretty good.I mean, this is NOT a great film... in fact there is one point in the movie where I am convinced that I saw absolutely the WORST acting in a major film outside of Battlefield Earth... but it is fun. Terry O'Quinn is decent as the title character. The rest of the cast works relatively well and the story is somewhat engaging. The plot works right up until the end, it maintains a certain engaging quality that keeps you from nodding off inappropriately. The end is not that great, but I have seen worse. Overall, I enjoyed myself, which is alot more than I thought I would do. While I can't recommend this film for everyone, I can say with honesty that it will be well worth whatever 1/5 of a 5-pack is in your local video store. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1980's were a fantastic decade for cheesy, gory, gooey and cheapie horror movies but the output of genuinely frightening and atmospheric thrillers was relatively minimal. Joseph Ruben's "The Stepfather" is a notable exception. Whereas this could have been just another low-keyed 80's horror flick, Ruben delivered an intelligent and haunting chiller with the emphasis on identifiable character drawings and plausible situations. "The Stepfather" somewhat balances between a typically 80's domestic slasher and an authentic Hitchcockian thriller. The basic premise sounds cheap and easy to exploit, but the screenplay is well- written and the tension building happens slow and with great respect towards the audience. Cute but rebellious 16-year-old Stephanie hates her stepfather Jerry Blake, who came between her and her beloved mother and insists on playing the perfect happy little family. That's fairly normal for a teenager, of course, but Stephanie is really convinced that Jerry is a murderous psychopath and even confesses to her psychiatrist that she's terrified of him. Nobody believes her, as Jerry is such a sympathetic neighbor and role model family guy, but more and more details show that Jerry might be the metamorphosed deranged murderer who butchered his entire family one year earlier. Multiple sequences in "The Stepfather" are standout genius. Jerry's outbursts of rage in the basement are particularly unnerving, as it's truly disturbing how this man purchases the American Dream. There are numerous other great scenes, including the confrontation between Jerry and Steph's psychiatrist, the transformations and the intense climax. Needless to say the film owes a lot of its impact and cult status to the impeccable lead performances. Jill Schoelen is divine as the stubborn and slightly troublesome teenager (even though she was 24 years of age already at the time) and Terry O'Quinn gives away one of the most flawless impersonations of the whole decade. His character is what all of us should fear the most; psychopathic monsters with an amazing intellect and unpredictable personalities. They exist, sadly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminally overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming toward the tail end of the popular slasher genre of the 1980s, I have never quite fathomed the critical popularity of this overrated thriller, unless it was simply the novelty of having a psycho slasher film populated predominantly by adult characters rather than teens. Terry O'Quinn has the title role of a psychopath who makes a habit of marrying widows/divorcées with children and trying to forcibly conform them into his personally idealized 1950s Father Knows Best view of how families act and then getting homicidal when they fail to meet his lofty expectations. The film opens in the bloody aftermath of his last failed family before he then alters his appearance to go trolling for his next set of family/victims. We next see our family man comfortably ensconced in the lives of Shelly Hack and her troubled daughter Jill Schoelen. Hack is oblivious, but Schoelen is pretty sure that there is something "not right" about her stepfather and her suspicions are more than likely to elicit O'Quinn's homicidal tendencies. Made before and missing the light comical flourishes of Scream, the film takes itself in dead earnestness. Unfortunately, for all its seriousness, the film follows familiar notes by rote and never elicits any surprise or suspense, and emerges as merely an unpleasant viewing experience. One scene where O'Quinn brutally attacks and murders the nice guy guidance counselor of his teenage daughter is particularly cringe-worthy, but in much the same way that an especially gory scene from Friday the 13th would elicit that response. It also does not help that the performances are so flat and elicit limited sympathy. Hack is so dim and unwitting that she seems cut from the same Stepford mold as her psycho hubby. Our sympathy should rest with Schoelen, who gives the best performance in the film, but there is something very remote about her acting that prevents us from truly embracing her character. O'Quinn's much ballyhooed performance is a hot mess. He is not a looker and there is nothing charming or appealing about his faux personas to make us understand why one woman, much less a slew of them, would fall into his net and succumb to marriage, especially bringing along families who harbor suspicions about him. His range in the role is laughably limited and he fails to either provide someone so appalling that we would root against him or to elicit any sympathy for a mentally ill man desperate for the "perfect" family. Given that I am also not a fan of his strained performance in Lost, I am undoubtedly in the minority here. One would think that with the subsequent emergence of the frothing "family values" crowd in the US that the film would take on a certain relevance, but even such after-the-fact parallels fails to elevate this to a higher level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second-rate thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stepfather" is one of those journeyman scary flicks which targets the teenage we'll-buy-into-anything-and-sneak-into-everything movie market. Trashy, contrived, obvious, predictable, and full of unfamiliar faces and cardboard characters, "The Stepfather" is a no brainer popcorn flick which should provide a modicum of entertainment to viewers of late night t.v. in trailer parks around America.

		<shortDescription>Hugely disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the reviews I had read about "The Stepfather" were positive. I had also seen Ruben's previous picture, "Dreamscape", which was a highly enjoyable sci-fi entry. But this movie turned out to be a serious disappointment.It doesn't take you long to realize that this movie was made on an extremely low budget. Although it's hampered by that fact, it's not ruined by it. But many other aspects are equally weak. The script lacks originality and depth, giving us few insights into the characters. O'Quinn's performance is fairly one-note (I think that the girl who played the daughter was much better). And the ending is full of all the old slasher-movie cliches, like the one according to which the psycho has to be "killed" several times, because he has superhuman strength.I don't know if the filmmakers had an Alfred Hitchcock homage in mind when they were making this, but the result plays more like a lame "Friday The 13th" rip-off. This is just an ambitious slasher pic. </fullReview>
