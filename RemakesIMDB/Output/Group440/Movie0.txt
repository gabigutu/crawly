		<shortDescription>Doesn't have the subtlety of the original but still an enjoyable remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stepfather" is a remake of the 1987 cult classic by the same name staring Terry O'Quinn. The story begins with Michael Harding (Penn Badgley) returning home from military school to find his mother (Sela Ward) happily in love and living with her new boyfriend, David (Dylan Walsh). As the two men get to know each other, Michael becomes more and more suspicious of the man who is always there with a helpful hand. Is he really who he says he is or could David be hiding a dark side ? Along with his girlfriend Kelly (Amber Heard), his father Jay (Jon Tenney), and Susan's friends (Paige Turco and Sherry Stringfield), they slowly start to piece together the mystery of the man who is set to become his stepfather, but they may be too late in getting to the truth... In the last decade we've witnessed a lot of remakes and spin offs, most of them unnecessary, and that's the case with this film. And the reason why it is unnecessary, is because it doesn't add anything to the original besides a groovy soundtrack. The film doesn't really have a voice of its own, instead it's almost a play by play remake with a few differences to make it up to date. Despite being unnecessary, this remake is still quite enjoyable, however, it doesn't have the subtlety of the original and also Terry O'Quinn was much better as a protagonist then Dylan Walsh. O'Quinn had more charisma and delivered his lines with much more impact. And then there's a few things that drag the film down, like the sexualization of Amber Heard ( numerous shots of the young actress in her bikini and underwear, which I wouldn't mind, had it been done more tastefully instead of being a deliberate attempt to please the male audience), plus the poorly done makeovers of David and the lesbian subplot which made absolute no sense to me and seemed out of place. Despite all this, The Stepfather is still a nice little thriller and quite enjoyable, just know that the original is far better.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amber Heard in a bikini...oh yeah...and some other stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to give this movie a favorable review only because it delivered something it didn't promise and that took me by surprise. The Stepfather, as I'm sure you all know, is a remake (reboot?) of the 80's slasher series that set the tone for every darn Lifetime movie starring Valerie Bertinelli or Nancy McKeon. A desperate divorcée falls for a mysterious guy who, despite telegraphing to the audience how evil he secretly is, manages to fool his fiancée and her family into thinking that he's a swell guy....that is, until the body count starts. The plot isn't worth discussing. There's nothing here that we haven't seen before. What IS worth discussing is the director's obvious decision to exploit Amber Heard's lovely figure in one long never ending cheesecake sequence. You could make the argument that the ONLY reason this film was even made in the first place was to launch Amber into the stratosphere of blogworthy sex symbols (not unlike what Michael Bay managed to do with Megan Fox). You'll see Amber in her underwear lounging in bed, Amber in her itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini, gratuitous close-ups of her splendid anatomy, etc. This exploitation becomes so flagrant that it distracts from the story itself, which is probably a good thing. In a way the Stepfather 2009 comes off more like a 70's Drive-In flick; the kind teenagers would flock to in hopes of seeing a little skin. Maybe that was the point after all? I sure hope it was. The movie certainly doesn't deliver much else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm pretty sure this movie comes on Lifetime about three times a day. Not that there is anything wrong with re-telling an old story. I loved Christian Bale as Batman. But telling a story again in the same way as I've seen it a million times before? No likey. The biggest problem that I have with this movie is this. If there were no music in the entire movie... it would not have been remotely creepy. The only thing that seems to tip characters off that something may be awry is the ominous music in the background. There was not a single genuinely scary moment. "Oh no, my future step-father is standing in the kitchen! He must be a murderer!" Save your money, turn on Lifetime and watch the man hating gold you're already paying for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliché and predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the opportunity to see this film for free at an advanced screening last week. What I was met with was a poorly constructed and executed film. Fifteen minutes into The Stepfather I was bored and could not wait for the ending credits to roll.Characters in this movie were poorly thought out and extremely static. The way many of them acted was so unrealistic that it was hard to watch at points. Amber Heard's character was undeveloped and pointless, merely a factor of eye-candy as she was in her underwear or a bikini for 97% of the movie. Even Sela Ward lacked in the acting category in this film.If the stale characters weren't enough to make you grunt in agony then the plot and atmosphere was. The soundtrack was riddled with horrible music choices that clashed entirely with the mood of the movie. And the plot was extremely predictable and overdone. The Stepfather fully utilized the "dramatic music and close-to-danger" situation that results in nothing but making the viewer think something was going to actually happen.I knew the rest of the audience attending was in agreement with my opinion of the movie as stupid plot mechanism after stupid plot mechanism continued the "thrilling suspense." People were sarcastically shouting "Oh my god!" and "Come on!" and I couldn't agree more. How many cell phones need to break to put these characters in a state of panic? How many times must the villain magically revive himself after a near-fatal beating? Yawn.Don't see this movie. It was not worth being free, not worth the time. Best part of the movie for me? The movie theater popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much like Disturbia, but not enough to make it good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be the most predictable horror movie I've ever seen (and I use the word "horror" lightly). Every time there's a closeup of someone's face and the shot is slightly to one side, you can guarantee there'll be a killer behind them. When the old woman is pushed down the stairs, my whole theater laughed out loud. The fact that it wasn't enough for the kid to think his stepfather was a killer when he saw him in the basement through the vents checking his missing dad's cell phone, but when the kid himself suddenly is missing a picture he took of his stepfather on his cell phone, then it's time to freak out, because that is a sure indication a new family member is a killer.Then there are the unnecessary shots of the young teenaged couple who always happen to be in bathing suits because I think Nelson McCormick must get off on that kind of thing. They must get sick of swimming at some point?! And of course, the ending, the wannabe "false climax." Sela Ward locks herself in the bathroom when her new husband starts coming after her with a knife, and as he's trying to bust down the door, he knocks the mirror off the door. Understandable, right? THEN he finally knocks the door in and gets in the room. Sela Ward has a piece of shattered glass in her hand and is wielding it against the much stronger, very built man who has killed numerous people before with knives. She stabs him in the neck (I have no knowledge as to how he didn't just stab her first) and he falls into the bathtub with a shard of glass protruding from his neck. She then meets with her son and her son's girlfriend in the kitchen and they decide they need to leave, when all of a sudden, BOOM: there's the killer! But wait...didn't he get stabbed in the neck? And that must've severed numerous arteries which would cause severe internal bleeding...but oh well, he's back, and with only a little splotch of blood on his neck.And my last complaint is merely how cheap the transition from movie to credits looked. I felt like I was watching "Beverly Hills Cop": suddenly, there was a single still shot and the credits all faded in at once. And the god-awful version of that famous song by The Turtles done by Filter is playing and it just doesn't fit, and ugh.Save the 9.50. Don't go see this film. Only way you should willingly decide to watch it is if you stream it on Netflix for FREE. Don't pay anything. Anything more than a cent is a waste on this clichéd piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe people are expecting more and more from films-its just a movie-its not your life. I thought as something to sit down and watch for a bit it was fair game. I have a technical mind and I always think about how many times they did a certain scene or how many scenes were left on the cutting floor for the finished product. Longer than usual, it was not very bloody which was kind of a relief, and it probably had more in common with the thrillers made in the 1950s, than something out of the modern age. In real life stepfather's can be an unwelcome event, so in that sense this movie taps a vein of something unsettling in the real world. Above average acting helped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again the trailer was better than the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though a lot of the elements were typical and expected in this movie, it still held interest and had a few good 'gotcha' moments. However, as it neared the end, it seemed that the editor just hacked together an ending to shorten the movie down because it was in danger of actually being two hours long. In fact, one of the coolest terror scenes in the trailer was when the circular saw falls from the attic and dangles over the girlfriend, (like Vincent Price's Pit and the Pendulum) but guess what? It's NOT in the movie. I was ticked off. Now, I know some scenes are in a trailer and don't make it to the final cut, but come on! It's the last shots in the trailer and the most terrifyingly memorable! It's false advertising at it's worst! Oh well, hopefully it will be in the DVD release, making that a good reason to skip seeing it in the theaters.Sadly the popularity of this film hinges on the reality that way too many men marry into a family and think they can have everything go their way without regard for how the children have been raised before they came along. Kids love to push boundaries and rarely ever accept the 'new dad' as anything more than an ATM, so the guy let's his frustration build to the point where he explodes on them, losing all credibility and respect. Obviously they don't all become psycho killers, but the abuses run rampant in today's society, so it's no surprise why so many teens are eager to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Better 80s Slasher Remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Harris (Dylan Walsh) has tried to make his family work, but it just wasn't going to happen. So he kills them and starts over in a new town. But it's never that simple, is it? Will this new family work or will the killing have to start all over again? Like many other recent horror films (at least a dozen in the past year), this is a remake. And I loved the original, a powerhouse lead by the undefeatable Terry O'Quinn ("Lost") with 1980s scream queen Jill Schoelen ("Popcorn"). So, needless to say, I liked the original better... but the remake still has something to offer.Dylan Walsh does a fine job and is more than good enough trying to be creepy and comforting at the same time. Sela Ward, his wife, seemed lacking and was probably the weakest character in the story. The son, Michael (Miley Cyrus' crush, Penn Badgley), was respectable and a strong supporting lead (though not Jill Schoelen). And his girlfriend (Amber Heard)... well, someone needs to tell me why she was always in a bikini or her underwear. That chick needs to eat a sandwich.For being PG-13, the suspense and thrills were very nice. There was a cat fake-out, and even with one scene cut (it contains a buzzsaw... watch for it on DVD) there was some good, old-fashioned butt-kicking. And, like any modern horror film, they had to take technology into account -- cell phones and the Internet were utilized as part of the plot. I don't happen to think the "America's Most Wanted" sketch looked like David Harris, but that's forgivable.I don't know what to make of the lesbian subplot... that requires a second viewing or a commentary track to explain.You must see the original, but this isn't a bad film, either. And if you're younger and maybe not ready for full blown horror (although I don't think any age is too young), this is a good stepping stone. Just turn off your ears before the horrifyingly bad remake of The Turtles' "Happy Together" in the closing credits. I like Filter, but this song fails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average remake full of suspense , thrills and gory killings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A meek-looking guy man named David Harris (Dylan Wash)marries widows and divorcées with children in search of the perfect family. As soon as his new family members show signs of being human and not robots who will march unquestioningly to his tune, his dreams of domestic bliss begin to crumble, and he murders them. Then he alters his appearance, assumes a new identity, and skips to another town to begin the deadly ritual all over again. He attempts to marry Susan Harding (Sela Ward) , who sees him as the ideal surrogate father for his sons , and he is soon up to his old tricks when she proves to be too much of a troublesome young son Michael (Penn Badgley) to handle. As Michael goes back home from military school to find his mother falling in love and living with her new love interest . As both of them get to know each other, he along with his father (Jon Tenney) become more and more suspicious of the person who is always there with a helpful hand .Exciting thriller has well-cast Dylan Walsh who manages to deliver a good performance as a family-values man in search of the perfect little family but he results to be a psycho who eventually erupts into violence. But Amber Heard steals the spectacle showing a breathtaking bikini playing as son's girlfriend . The film turns out to be an inferior remake from successful original ¨The stepfather¨ (1987) by Joseph Ruben with Terry O'Quinn , Jill Schoelen, and Shelley Hack that was followed by other two follow-up as ¨ Stepfather 2¨ (1989) by Jeff Burr again with Terry O' Quinn , along with Meg Foster and Jonathan Brandis and ¨Stepfather 3¨ . Rating : 5,5 ; acceptable and passable .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Remake of a Classic B-Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After killing the whole family in Salt Lake City, the psychopath David Harris (Dylan Walsh) moves to Portland where he approaches to the divorced Susan Harding (Sela Ward) with her son Sean (Braeden Lemasters) and her daughter Beth (Skyler Samuels) in a supermarket. Six months later, David is living with Susan in her suburban house and the couple is planning to get married. When her rebel son Michael (Penn Badgley) returns home from military school, David welcomes Michael and supports him to stay home. But sooner Michael observes that the past of David is absolutely unknown and he suspects that his stepfather might be the missing killer. But neither her girlfriend Kelly Porter (Amber Heard) nor his mother see anything wrong with the stranger. The 1987 "The Stepfather" is a classic B-thriller, with Terry "John Locke" O'Quinn very convincing in the role of the deranged psychopath. This poor remake is terrible, beginning with the cast of the weirdo Dylan Walsh in the lead role. The transposition of the story from the late 80's to 2009 is absurd since with the present means of communication, the identity of David Harris would never remain unknown with the facility to retrieve his social security number or use of the Internet and software like Photoshop to check his face without beard, especially considering that he is among the ten most wanted criminals in America. The exaggerated use of clichés and the conclusion are awful, and I would like to ask the writers who would survive to a stab in the neck with such piece of glass. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "O Padrasto" ("The Stepfather")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS...DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE ..I watched this tonight with some friends. It wasn't a complete waste of time, that's for sure. Good acting on some parts and kinda lame on the other. You know what I'm talking about, if you've seen it. There was barely any intense scenes. Yeah, a few. But not that much. Body count (Not including the family in the opening scene), ends at 2. The real father and the crazy cat lady across the street. Wow..And does he die in the end? No. They leave it open for another one. (Please No) The intense scenes they DID have, weren't bad for what they were. It was way more of a drama in my eyes.Maybe rent it first.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Amber Heard's Bikini"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...the real title of this film.TWO WARNINGS:1) I checked two "user" reviews for this movie here on IMDb which were good/favorable towards this movie and they have NO OTHER COMMENT HISTORY! Or any history, of any kind, with IMDb.com. To me, that means these reviews are planted BY THE STUDIO, cast, or crew!2) This comment contains no spoilers at all, for there is nothing about this film to spoil or give away, honest! NO. That's the first thing you should say to anyone who asks you to see this. Better yet, make another movie suggestion. Not even a hot date is worth taking to this because there will never be a second date and nothing is gonna happen after the date either! Plot in a nutshell- Serial Killer looking for the "perfect family", formerly troubled son returns home after 6 months away at a military school, is suspicious of his new stepfather, and shakes things up.There are numerous things the writer and director could have done with this movie. My expectations were exceedingly low (the same dud-making-duo behind the 2008 "Prom Night" re-imagining) and were fulfilled.Followers of the original cult classic will not find a remake or re-imagining but a different film with the title "The Stepfather" attached.Almost every possible scenario which could have benefited this movie was either rushed, failed at during the execution, or left out entirely. Believe it or not, there isn't even one decent scene where Mom and son have the "he's a monster serial killer why are you marrying him?!?" fight. What the film is reduced to is us watching Amber Heard wear a new two-piece swimsuit every other scene while floating in the pool with the troubled son (no, I'm not even kidding), trying not to laugh at Sela Ward's nose-job, ignoring the blatant homophobic references ("Meet him in the basement? for what?") including the 12 year-old giggle factor of two women saying "I love you" to each other, and rushed kill scenes devoid of any true violence.I did give this film 2 stars however. The first is for not being as bad as their "Prom Night" remake. The second is for making a film which will end both of their careers, more or less. Let's not pay Hollywood any more money to produce sanitized waste like this movie. Suggestion? Go see the "Last House on the Left" remake instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great film but I kinda sorta enjoyed it =)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a strict policy that states movies featuring either (a) a cat suddenly jumping out from a corner accompanied by an ominous sounding music chord or (b) a mirror that is empty of anyone but one character who turns away, then turns back and suddenly sees the killer in the mirror behind them...well these movies are only going to be so good. This movie has both, within about 60 seconds of each other. In spite of this, I have to say it's really not all that bad. I've seen many people complaining about the lack of originality, but when you're remaking a horror film from the 80's, it's almost inevitable that you're going to give the audience something they've seen before. That wasn't really bothersome to me though because the characters and anticipation overshadowed it for the most part.Dylan Walsh plays the stepfather in a role that was actually likable for the first part of the film. He meets a single mom played by Sela Ward and all is picture perfect until her bad boy son comes home from military school. We only know he's bad by the way because someone tells us. He's a pretty normal, well adjusted kid considering that his dad is no longer around and his mother has engaged herself to a stranger in the span of 6 months. Far as I could tell, his behavior is still within normal range. It might have made for a more interesting film though if he really was a wild child.So past that everyone knows what follows with the story. There is not a lot of gratuitous violence; even the killing scenes are low key which I don't really mind. If anyone is looking for lots of gore and clever death shots, this is not the film for them. The excitement is in the buildup, the experience of the characters finding out for themselves who the stepfather really is; especially when you have the one obligatory character, in this case the wayward son, who seems to intuit everything about the man from the first time he sets eyes on him. That standard plot device, a character who has it all figured out and NO ONE will believe him, well it's beyond old but it's moderately effective here.The mindless and unnecessary adolescent dialogue, together with the many gratuitous bikini shots of the son's pale and too skinny girlfriend, tend to bring the quality of the film down. They were neither necessary nor helpful. But if you can look past that and the lack of originality (is it fair to expect that in this film really?) then you'll find an adequate film that's worth a couple hours of your time. I've seen much worse in the horror/thrillers in the past few years.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young man comes home from school to find his mother is in love with a new boyfriend. Something about the boyfriend doesn't sit well with the son and he begins to dig into the man's past only to find the very real possibility that he's a psychopath murdering less than perfect families in his wake.Okay remake of the 1987 minor classic that spawned sequels and made Terry O'Quinn a star. The problem with the film here is two fold. First the film rather blandly told. It seems like a film that was thrown together with an aim for TV but ended up being better than they hoped so they put it into theaters (also its PG-13 makes this a rather bloodless affair). The other problem is that Dylan Walsh as the stepfather isn't as menacing as Terry O'Quinn. To be certain he seems more like a regular guy, but when it comes down to being a monster he's just not as frightening.I didn't hate this but at the same time I was wondering why I was watching it. I should have waited for cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked, fantastic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, after seeing a lot of reviews of this movie, I can honestly say that I'm a little perplexed. A lot of them seem to believe this is some kind of Lifetime movie, some call it a typical dumbed-down teen thriller and I saw one reviewer call it a call back to old horror titillation, and I'm surprised and that this film is neither of those. In fact, it's the exact opposite. While some Lifetime thirllers revolve around a woman who is being tortured by her abusive husband, who'm she must try to escape from his evil man-grasp, this film is actually about the older son of the family who tries to prove to his mother that her boyfriend is evil, much to the mother's (understandable) denial. It's not a teen revenge movie about a kid who trying to rail against the new guy in his life who (for some unexplained reason) is evil. It's a film about domestic life and show's you every minute of what's happening with both the son and the stepfather, explaining every happening and soaking up all the tension between them, with the only exposure to his teen life his girlfriend, who serves less as his flat love interest to escape to and more like his straight-man who calls him about on an obsession based on a (though correct) simple distrust. Speaking of which, the reviewer who said this was all about the skin and sex appeal must have been pretty prudish, because I think there's about one scene which focuses about them making out, and it's pretty tame as far as thrillers go. She spends most of movie in her bikini, but it's never the focus of any shot. The character's are an oddity in film today, as they're likable for the most part, and when they aren't, it's understandable. This especially odd for the teen couple, who seem intelligent and more than one note. The stepfather is affable, and pulls off the charming part well for the most part, seeming just like the stepdad you've always wanted. He commits murders throughout the movie, but if they never showed any before the end the only thing you would suspect is that the son is obsessed...except for the blasting soundtrack, which I'll admit eases up toward the middle. There's no campiness or over-the-topness in the movie, and everything is done in a realistic fashion, enough to say that if someone was this smart and charming, this could happen to you. It's a bit anti-climatic at times, but otherwise keep you satisfied through out the film.This is a thriller/horror movie that keeps up with the times. It's not like horror movies today that seem to forget they're not in the 70's, making advances in technology into huge plot holes or underestimates the intelligence of today's people, whether the characters or the audience. Rather it uses those advances to it's advantage and perfectly measures the logic and understanding of people today, sometimes using it to add relief or tighten suspense. It takes everything you knows about thillers, and while it doesn't turn them all around or revolutionize anything, it at least stays away from the stereotypes or make the standard tropes less tired It's not some kind of Lifetime movie of the week, or MTV Award bait, or even one of those David Loughery faux-thrillers; what this is a tight scripted, well-acted, truly suspenseful film that keeps you guessing, if you can predict what already happens. I recommend a lot of movies, but if your a horror or suspense fan and you've at least okay with the remakes of films like Friday the 13th or My Bloody Valentine, you have to go see this movie! It will amaze you in how they keep everything fresh and tense!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not seen the original version of The Stepfather I have to say that normally I'm not a fan of remakes, and usually, yes, I do loathe them because they always tend to be a load of crap (Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes for example..). However, since I haven't seen the original Stepfather film I can't compare them both, but what I have seen in this remake is something else. I was really, really impressed with this, and I am going to have to seek out the original now to see what it was like.The Stepfather basically tells the story of "David" - a disturbed man who is apparently normal and caring on the outside but very unstable on the inside, both psychologically and emotionally and one of who lives a lot double lives, looking for recently divorced women to emotionally manipulate them and ultimately, breaks them down and kills them and any immediate family. I always compare him to the girl out of the Orphan because they both have nearly the same tactics at luring people into trusting them - in fact this movie reminded me of Orphan a lot. Anyway, when he senses he may be in danger of having his history found out, "David" takes even more extreme action to cover his steps up a lot quicker than he would normally do. "David" has been doing this many for years, and also has evaded capture from the police by changing his appearance and never using any ID when purchasing, for example a car. He always pays in cash, and always changes his appearance in somewhat way before moving onto his next victim. You may think it's a relatively simple plot, but the movie itself is a lot of fun and suspense. There's also a lot of psychological tension and build up as "David"'s new family become suspicious of his activities and his apparent lack of background information. As the movie progresses, things turn for the worse for the family he has deceived as they become wary of his background.The acting is first class, and the guy who acts as "David", Dylan Walsh? I think that's his name. He is very convincing in his role. I honestly can't find one bad thing to say about this movie, as I definitely enjoyed it, and the build up of psychological suspense kept me watching until the very end of the credits. All in all it's quite excellent, and I've given it a 9 out of 10, simply losing one point because it is still a remake, but one that is excellent.If you're a fan of Orphan or indeed, The Strangers, The Stepfather's psychological factors may just peek your interests here. Definitely a must watch at some point. Very enjoyable!</fullReview>

Yes, there are some predictable parts, and yes it is a scenario we have scene time and time again, but if your looking for a suspense thriller for 2009, this can be added to your list. The Stepfather plays a good role with his intense ways. The oldest son is realizing there is something totally not right with this picture, but he is well distracted by his girlfriend. She thinks her boyfriend Michael is paranoid of his "soon to be" new Stepfather. The Mom is oblivious, her sister is curious! Everything starts unraveling along with the Stepfather's nerves when things seem to not go his way. Makes you wonder why the Mom doesn't care about any information on her future husband, guess she's wearing those rose colored glasses awful thick! It's a movie worth watching, if anything, you'll be entertained! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrated Director's Cut Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Harding returns home from military school to find his mother happily in love and living with her new boyfriend, David. As the two men get to know each other, Michael becomes more and more suspicious of the man who is always there with a helpful hand. Is he really the man of her dreams or could David be hiding a dark side?THE STEPFATHER is a sufficient thriller that gets the job done the way you expect it to. It has suspense, good performances, and is well made. I haven't seen the original film starring Terry O'Quinn so I can't compare it with the remake. However, I can say the remake is entertaining and is engaging while it lasts. What more can you ask for?The thing that I liked the most here was the family dynamics. I didn't know what to expect from Penn Badgley, who plays the main character, but he pulls off a very convincing performance. Sela Ward as the mother is just great and the pretty blond who shows some skin, Amber Heard, can actually act! Paige Turco and Jon Tenney were really good in their roles as well. However, it's obvious that Dylan Walsh is the main star of the film. He does a fantastic job as the crazy stepfather. Some of his scenes just gave me chills.There's also quite a bit of suspense in here, which surprised me. Sure, there's one cat jump scare (don't you just hate those?), but that's forgivable because there was only one. Some of the death scenes were quite disturbing as well. Being a PG-13 movie and all, you might expect death scenes with no blood to be quite "lame," as they say it, but that's where you're wrong. They're pretty realistic and not over the top as you might have seen in other films.If there's one thing I must complain about, it's the payoff. I thought it was way too short and that it could have been longer. In the end, however, the remake keeps you very interested until the very end. There's rarely any moment where you'll find yourself looking at your watch because the thriller gets the job done and does it efficiently and effectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was definitely worth the $1 I paid for it to rent. I know some people think this plot line has been done to death, but I think it works. My mom and I were jumping and our hearts were pounding through the really intense parts. Just what you'd want in a thriller.It starts out with a man shaving and apparently he's trying to change his appearance. You'll soon find out why as he descends the stairs and makes a cup of coffee and toast. He's a classic sociopath who cares little about the repercussions of the lifestyle he chooses to live as a murderer. He gets close--too close--to his victims. Dylan Walsh plays a pretty good psychopathic serial killer.I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a thriller and doesn't mind clichéd plots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This remake is a pretty solid film by itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Stepfather' is a fairly decent thriller and slightly-slasher film in a time where films like this are horribly made. I've never seen the original 'Stepfather' film, but from what I can tell, this remake isn't too shabby. It has strong leads and a decent and straightforward script with good pacing. I loved the introduction of the film, where it explains how the "Stepfather" killer is able to kill a family and get away with it so many times. I like how there's never really a slow or boring part in the film. We like the main son, Michael, and his girlfriend. I think Penn Badgley and Amber Heard were good in their roles. I especially liked Dylan Walsh as the stepfather. Walsh made the character both likable and hated, and made him interesting. I didn't like how clueless the mom was; she's a complete idiot. One of the biggest problems the film had was the actions some of the characters took that didn't make sense. No one would logically marry someone they knew nothing about; it's just unrealistic. And there's one part where the stepfather walks out to his front lawn while there's a bunch of policemen right across the street. If you're a mass murderer on the run, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't make yourself that noticeable to the police. Also, the stepfather should have had the cell phone turned off from the beginning, not when someone's trying to call the cell phone. It's ridiculous. The stepfather's supposed to be a smart and clever guy, but we don't see that when he's with this new family. With all of this said and done, I felt that this remake of 'The Stepfather' didn't offer anything new, but it does entertain. I did like the ending and what happens to the stepfather; I felt it was a fairly good and interesting conclusion to the film. Though the ending may have felt rushed and quick, I was fine with it.PS: This remake of 'The Stepfather' in a lot of ways felt like 2007&#x2032;s 'Disturbia' (3 Kents out of 4!). I was constantly reminded of 'Disturbia' while I was watching 'The Stepfather.' However, I like 'Disturbia' more and think it was made better and more interesting. The third act of 'Disturbia' wasn't great, though, which I think the remake of 'The Stepfather' succeeds in ? having the film go through a constantly interesting pace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepfather (2009) non spoiler review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since 09 I enjoyed this film several times. Its not the most thrilling film ever but i think the great actors, high production values and solid direction keep it from being a bad movie that's hard to watch, to me.Its entertaining PG-13 fun! I saw this in theaters, it was a blast. I have seen it on TV and DVD since its release, its a fun watch. I know a lot of people disliked this movie and they have a right to their opinion, i am entitled to mine. People had their reasons; "Not as good as the original" "lead actor was not good" "Film was not suspenseful" and so on. Some of it i can agree with but not all of it. I believe it has a lot of value to it in terms of reply. Its an easy sit. I (easily) recommend it to people who don't mind PG-13 remakes. This is one of the better ones, in my opinion. I would give this a 6 or 7 out of 10. Thank you for reading!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best 80s Remake So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though The Stepfather was a remake, it was pretty good. It is probably one of the better remakes, because it does not do so much re-imagining, as it does updating. It takes a genuinely scary concept from the eighties, and makes it work for modern times. Now, the movie does not use much CGI, it tries to stick with older techniques. There are actually far more compliments than complaints with this movie. Even though the plot is laid out from the beginning, it is interesting to watch. It was enjoyable to watch as he lied, manipulated, and murdered. It used a lot of dramatic irony, probably more so than most movies I have seen recently. Not that it is a bad thing, it was actually quite refreshing for a movie to not really hide anything from you, but hide it from its characters. In the current market, it seems that, movies are trying to leave the audience stumbling around trying to figure out the plot, while this movie comes around and just lets the audience enjoy the ride. The dialog felt very real, even with the stepfather's bizarre emotions and actions. It did not really feel like it was trying too hard to sound legitimate, it just was what it was. That may seem like a given, but when you watch a lot of really bad movies, it is refreshing to have a group of writers who know what they are doing. The only really problem I have with the movie. The older son is supposed to be in high school, somewhere before senior year. The problem is that he, and his girlfriend, look and act like they are in college. Now that seems like a small issue, but it kept drawing me out of the movie because every once and a while he would comment that he still needs to get his driver's license or something, and that would immediately pull me out and beat me over the head. The movie really is pretty good, I might even say that it is better than the original, but I saw the remake first. Other than a few continuity issues, the movie is really well done. Definitely worth watching if you are into thriller, or horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks just a little bit like Disturbia, and by a little I mean a lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the previews came out for this movie last spring and summer, I watched and thought "Hmm, this movie looks just a little bit familiar. Oh ya there was that really good movie a few years ago called Disturbia". The plots of these two movies are identical, there's a few differences that makes The Stepfather its own movie though. But the biggest thing that sets it apart is what, at least I thought was going to happen in Disturbia. I'm talking about the mom getting with the killer. They danced around it in Disturbia, but that was the big difference in The Stepfather that made it its own movie. When watching the Disturbia, I was thinking "Wow, wouldn't it be cool if the mom got with the killer?" Well I'm glad it didn't because when it did in The Stepfather it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Now I'll try to be semi positive about this by talking about some of the good things the movie offered.I think one of the biggest reasons people saw this movie just might have been because there was a really hot actress in it. I didn't mind that she was in a bathing suit for about 95% of the movie, I actually liked it, but it just didn't make sense. I think the guy actor to only wore clothes other then shorts like maybe twice as well, didn't get that either. I guess no one there wears clothes other than bathing suits? The killer, I can't think of his name right off the back but i know he's from Nip Tuck. He's a good actor, he was probably the best part of the movie. He was the best part because he did a good job trying to be the good guy and the killer at the same time. I think for the character they wanted people to think that he didn't want to kill anymore, that he did really want a family. His whole set up in the basement was stupid though, because they showed it like four times, and the most exciting/scary thing that happened down there was the main character's dad being killed and the main character being stuck down there while he killer's trying to kill his mom. The whole movie pretty much is set at the main characters house, I don't think he leaves that many times, sorta like Disturbia. But when doing this the audience is becoming familiar with the environment, and in it's own it becomes a bigger part of the movie. So in all the movie is not that bad, but it's not that good. It's worth watching for a rental, or even buying when it goes into the $5 bin. So I'm gonna give it a 6, it could've been a lot better then it actually was.</fullReview>

One, Michael(Penn Badgley), returns home from military school to find his mother has a live-in boyfriend David(Dylan Walsh). On first appearances David seems a likable and charming guy. But this ultimate nice guy has a past on the darker side. Pretending to be the ideal husband and stepfather, David has an ulterior motive when picking out Susan at the grocery store. David seems to have a bad habit of changing families like some people change houses. Michael begins delving into David's past to discover some possible deviate and psychotic activities. There is now an awkward feeling when you hear that "Daddy's home".Walsh makes himself pretty easy to dislike. Ward is good at what she does; but her friend Jackie(Paige Turco)is a stone fox.

		<shortDescription>How to turn a slasher flick into a PG, made for TV quality "light thriller"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago during a love affair with bad 80's slashers with multiple sequels I watched the original The Stepfather which was gory and disturbing and blood soaked like many 80's horror flicks. So I was excited to see this remake because I for one love remakes for the most part (Amityville Horror was amazing!) I should have thought more about this and known that walking into the film they would PG the movie and make it so pre-teen friendly that The CW could air it between Gossip Girl and 90210 (I like both those shows by the way.) Horror is toned down and reduced almost entirely to shock value and 'hidden kills.' That much disappoints and requires the entire film to rely on the cast and for the most part that doesn't work very well. The movie is not un-redeemable and has its moments but it loses a lot of ground in the horror genre. Instead it tries to borrow pieces from teeny thriller flicks like Disturbia, and better made remakes like Friday the 13th, and even Halloween which was not great but at least it was gory as anything. Ultimately the remake of The Stepfather ends up as a teen thriller more than a horror.Gossip Girl alumni Penn Badgley plays the black sheep returning from Military school. Badgley is decent in the leading role but having seen him in Gossip Girl and now this his range as an actor seems pretty limited as he basically plays the same role. I think I expected more from Sela Ward who plays the Mom and unsuspecting victim but she basically turns in a just okay performance. She adds to the "made for TV feel" of the whole thing. Amber Heard plays the eye candy of the film and in that aspect she does very well. Her and Badgley have decent chemistry but her character and performance is rather shallow and she does other than look pretty. Moving on to some stronger players in the film--Jon Tenney plays Badgley's real father who tries desperately to help protect his family including his ex-wife to no avail. Unfortunately Tenney is sparingly used and doesn't get a big role but he does bring some genuine emotion and intensity to the film. And finally the saving grace of the film is the disturbingly twisted performance by Dylan Walsh as The Stepfather. He gives a terrifically two sided performance as the loving doting father and new husband and then the twisted killer in the blink of an eye. One of the best lines in the film as the story unravels is him pausing to ask "Wait...who am I here?" Amazing. He makes an amazing killer to the film.Like much of the entire cast director Nelson McCormick comes from heavy Television and I always point that out and its not like I hold that against anyone because I love TV including some of the stuff McCormick has directed such as the brilliant Southland, CSI New York, Prison Break etc. but there is a big leap between telling an ongoing story in an hour and telling a complete story in two hours. I felt like perhaps McCormick wasn't given a lot to work with and it almost just seemed like a hobby to all of them rather than a serious attempt at a film (with the exception of Walsh.) The Stepfather was a bit of a cult classic to remake but I still had high expectations and while it isn't a complete mess it isn't made with adults in mind. So the good news is teens can watch it and adults can watch it at the same time but don't expect anything mind blowing. Its sadly subtle and poorly executed. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Not Bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Stepfather was one of those movies that wasn't a real big hit or a substantial cult hit yet even if no one remembered seeing it once you explained the movie a bit they knew precisely what it was.Very weird. Most know the original Terry O'Quinn as John Locke but to me he will always be Jerry Blake first then of course Peter Watts &amp; Locke. Having re-watched the original Stepfather just as the remake was released I found myself as I am with most old movies cringing &amp; shaking my head. However O'Quinns performance is the glue that makes the movie still watchable. Enter Dylan Walsh who to me will always be Dr.Sean McNamara. When I first saw the trailer for the remake I wasn't horrified or offended I just didn't care so I skipped it cause if you hate remakes then don't go &amp; pay to see them. I will however watch them for free at home at my own leisure depending on my curiosity level. Dylan Walsh was the motivation for me to even watch this new version &amp; im glad he was because this new Stepfather ain't half bad. Walsh is perfect for the part &amp; im curious to see how he does post Nip/Tuck. In a lot of ways this remake exceeds the original.At least in having stronger actors &amp; a slightly tighter premise.The problem then you ask? Well there's nothing to separate it from the countless other movies like it but considering the mess I was expecting &amp; didn't see well I rather enjoyed it. Penn Badgley (dont know who he is) does a pretty good job as the thorn in the Sepfathers side.His troubled past gives the movie all of its weight &amp; depth. Amber Heard plays his girlfriend &amp; not just high school but childhood sweethearts which albeit a small addition to the story lends a lot of credibility to their relationship. Everyone else in this movie are just playing the part they are required. Which is fine but adds nothing to the movie. Overall The Stepfather 09 is a good way to kill some time when you have nothing else to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepfather (2009) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing that some people are aware of my crusade against what I call "needless modern remakes of already modern-enough movies," I'm guessing they may very well ask why I bothered seeing a new version of the 1987 original (which was already a good horror-thriller as it stood). Well, my wife and our friends wanted to go to the movies and we'd already seen PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and SAW VI. Also, during one of those other recent trips to the theater I had spent a little time before the show sneaking into THE STEPFATHER for about ten minutes and examining what I now realize was its one best scene, so that made me more willing to take a chance and see the whole thing if everyone else was willing at a later date."By the numbers" is probably the best term I would use to sum up my impression of the new 2009 STEPFATHER. Not only had I seen the whole formula before (and I mean in a whole lot of other movies besides just the 1987 STEPFATHER), it offered nothing new or different (I won't spoil the ending except to say it was typical). Thankfully, Dylan Walsh in the title role (some may remember him as the good guy from the NIP/TUCK television series) manages to be effective enough. As an obsessed family man who murders one wife and set of children after another and keeps moving on, ever in search of the perfect household, he is suitably intense and deranged when he needs to be. But as the latest divorced woman he chooses to shack up with, Sela Ward isn't especially memorable here, and the best that may be said for her is that she looks pretty good for a lady in her 50's. The story spends far too much time on her teenage son and his pretty girlfriend, and for some reason we're inundated with a pop music soundtrack almost every time they're together, like we're watching FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH. It's been about ten years since I've seen the 1987 version, but I recall it being better than this one, and Terry O'Quinn as being superior in the part. I am currently awaiting a shipment of the recently released DVD of the original and hope to revisit it very soon just to make sure. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, anyone going into this movie to be scared should just give up and enjoy the few little frightening shots of the amazing Dylan Walsh. It's a good movie in a different kind of way, normally you see the killer either die or be locked up, but since he gets away, this made the movie 100x better for me. I enjoyed the cheap little scares because I knew going in that I wasn't going to have nightmares. A little too much of the swimming with the two whore teenagers. I don't know what was worse, the underwear shots of the teen girl, or the bathing suit shots. There was far too much physical contact emphasized between the two teens. Overall, I would say it wasn't amazing, but I went in expecting what I got, so I was happy. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was able to see a private screening of this movie at AMC on 86th Street and well it was pretty much what I expected of yet ANOTHER remake. It brings really nothing new to the table and pretty much just introduces younger crowds to our old school classics.The Stepfather is yet another movie remade and re-imagined but they couldn't really take it to far as the original did. The movie while yes its very suspenseful at times and I do have to say the audience was very much into the movie, some people were yelling at the screen so it did receive good audience feedback but for me personally I just have to say its just another Hollywood remake which introduces nothing new, nothing we didn't already know, just another cheap attempt for a movie studio to make a few bucks from the younger generation. Basically if you haven't seened it and have the time and no desire to see anything else check it out, if your a fan of the original don't check it out. Want to see a horror movie this Halloween then go see PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. The Stepfather is worth a viewing if you can see it during matinée hours.</fullReview>

I have not seen the 1980s movie that this one remakes, but I'm sure it's better than this mess. The only thing I really liked about this film was Penn Badgley, and his many shirtless scenes haha. Penn wasn't horrible in his character, he just wasn't that great either. He was good eye candy though, especially since the rest of the movie was crap. Dylan Walsh was just so so, nothing special, and I personally didn't think he was nearly creepy or threatening enough. The dialogue is just a bunch of recycled extremely clichéd lines thrown together. The action scenes are not that thrilling or scary. 2/10, would've had a 1 without Penn Badgley lol.</fullReview>

A troubled teen starts disliking his new stepfather but no one believes him at first.Dylan Walsh is the stepfather and he is not too menacing but that's good. Sela Ward as his unsuspecting wife is a bit too together looking to be fooled. Penn Badgley as Sela's son is perfectly adequate in the role - again, a bit too intelligent looking to be the troublesome kid. The gorgeous Amber Heard as Penn's girlfriend is a bit out of his league.Liked the ending - not too easy a victory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unclear Motives For Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stepfather: the husband of one's mother by a subsequent marriage." "Lover:... b. a person with whom one has sexual relations." (Webster's Collegiate Dictionary Tenth Edition) Now that I've cleared up this factual error on the part of the screenwriter the new 'Stepfather' succeeds as a good remake on the level that it takes much from the original films giving the audience what it wants. The opening scene and many of the lines are identical. "Who am I here?" "Maybe the disappointed him?" Unfortunately they do leave out the original stepfather's ominous whistling of 'Camptown Races.' The acting and production quality are solid.Of course the key element missing is Terry O'Quinn himself. This is why they need to stop remaking films where the original star's performance dooms all imitators. Let this be a lesson to the remake of 'I Am Legend' we get every few years. This role was played so well by the first two, Vincent Price in 1964 and Charlton Heston in 1971.The major problem with the new stepfather isn't the actor Dylan Walsh, but the character himself and his motives for murder which both seemed to have been overlooked by the screenwriter.One of the reason's the original stepfather was so frightening was that he was so perfect and so beloved by the community that no one believes the stepchild's warning. He was highly intelligent. The new stepfather comes across as more of a "poser" not successful enough to make it in life as himself and not adored by the wife's (or in this case lover's) friends.The new stepfather isn't that bright. For example, when he kills the ex-husband he does so with the taxi cab waiting for him outside on his way to the airport. Hence, when the ex-husband turns up missing records will show he missed his flight and the cab driver will remember, "Yes, I was waiting for him outside the house but he went in and never came back out. But the boyfriend did come out and paid the fair and collected the bags. Strange." In 'The Stepfather II' O'Quinn was sure to dispose of both the ex-husband's body and car.In fact the actual motives for the murders seem to be to merely conceal his identity.This is a major distortion of the original stepfather who was a "family annihilator" someone who loved his family so much that is his evil mind the only way to save them was to kill them.Here the motive for murder is the simple fact that he wants to conceal his identity from to avoid being caught by the police and going to jail.So he's not evil, just selfish? Ultimately a weaker villain.Overall not a bad remake but nothing close to the original first two films with Terry O'Quinn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is your standard Hollywood thriller. Polished, reasonably entertaining but dreadfully predictable. A serial killer who befriends families before killing them meets a recently divorced woman in a supermarket and marries her shortly afterwards. Her grown up son however soon has his suspicions about his new stepfather. It contains the usual stereotypical characters- outwardly nice but obviously sinister bad guy, gullible mom, smart kid etc. Whilst the characters may be stereotypical the actors do a decent job with what they have to work with. There are a few genuinely creepy and suspenseful scenes and the end half an hour is pretty tense. Although you know what's going to happen it's all done very slickly. The Stepfather is nothing we haven't seen before but it is entertaining and worth watching if you want something that won't tax the brain too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original stepfather was my ultimate classic from the 80s. Sure I discovered the movie a little late. But I also watched 'Poison Ivy' and 'The Orphan' prior to this so it takes away the novelty. The original is a classic as it set the standard for this sort of concept. Other movies just followed in it's path but didn't manage to offer anything new. This remake seemed like a more newer updated version. This remake came a little late and the subject was too routine for this decade of cinema. The main character didn't come across as frightening than compared to Terry O Quinn. He reminded me a lot Kurt Russell. He neither managed to press on the fear button. However his performance as the deranged stepfather was convincing but underplayed it to a smaller extent. The character of the son made the movie slightly interesting. It was due to his presence which made me watch on. His constant confrontations and hide and seek games always set in the suspense factor. However this did not make him exempt from character flaws. His constant attempts and methods to expose the truth about his new stepfather was so lame to the point of stupidity. If you're going to discreetly enter the bedroom to uncover some dirt relating to the past history, at least tell Amber Heard to keep an eye on the driveway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did I kept watching it?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was it because of Amber Heard's SPECTACULAR body in a bikini?? Was it because I kept thinking about the original "Stepfather"?.Nah, this remake surely hasn't the guts of the original in terms of violence and character development. Terry O'Quinn is unforgettable and Jill Schoelen was simply great.But in this one, we have the typical Hollywood plot that reminds you of any Warner Brothers t.v. series with the inclusion of a maniac who has a dark past. The pace is the best thing about it. It goes directly to the point. The acting is actually very good! The score was on, and the Direction was avid.Just give it a chance if you have anything better to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compared or Contrasted to the original, it's solid entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this even before (a little more than a year) I saw the original. And I own the DVD. In terms of entertainment, it's better than the 1987 Terry O'Quinn version. In terms of storytelling, it's equally good. So, on story level, I prefer the classic. Although that's overstating it just a little. Does Dylan Walsh make an interesting stepfather? Yes. To be honest, calling the character "evil" is an overstatement, since this movie doesn't really push the envelope, and is a thriller, rather than horror. And I wish there were more "stepfather" moments, such as where David Harris (whom he claims to be) does something physically wrong. A few too many moments in the movie feature Sela Ward as the clueless mom who never figures out what's going on. And especially Amber Heard, who's only purposes here are to, of course, doubt Penn Badgley until it's too late, and, of course, to provide eye candy showing off her breasts. On the other hand, I guess the stepfather is supposed to be emotionally frightening more than physically. But as they say, "I like it shaken not stirred".*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie opens in an unusual manner, the main character is shown cleaning up, shaving, and removing his personal items from home right after he has killed the rest of the family in Utah. He is nonchalant about the whole thing, but takes normal precautions of dealing only in cash and purchasing a new car. Next we see him land in Oregon, while the authorities try to locate and figure out who this cold-blooded killer is. And, they suspect, other such killings are his work also.Dylan Walsh is David Harris, pleasant with a ready smile, but somewhat deranged. This only becomes obvious under stress. He seems to be looking for the "perfect family" that he can become part of, and soon he meets a nice lady, recently divorced, and with three kids.Sela Ward is that lady, Susan Harding, who also has a teen son coming home after a year at military school to try and solve his misbehavior problem. He arrives a few months after Susan and David meet. In fact David has moved in, and he and Susan are planning to get married.Penn Badgley is the teen son, Michael Harding and his long time girlfriend is cute Amber Heard as Kelly Porter.So, with all that set up early, the movie is really about this arrangement and David. Will he be able to integrate into this family, or will he be disappointed one more time and kill everyone, then move on? There is a lot of suspense and more than passable acting. My wife said she was not too interested in the movie, and might just go read a book, but she could not leave, the story is too gripping.MAJOR SPOILERS: As things go well for David, and Michael even begins to accept him as a possible stepfather, we start to see obvious cracks in David's psyche. An older neighbor is said to have seen a drawing on America's Most Wanted and she thought it looked like David. So he intruded into her house and killed her, making it look like she fell down the stairs into her basement and broke her neck. Then when Michael's father got suspicious, David managed to dispose of him, but into the basement food freezer, only to be discovered later by Michael. In the movie's climax, there is a chase and struggle in the house, Michael and David fight and fall off the roof together. Michael ends up in the hospital but David manages to get away before police arrive. In the last scene we see David, in a new state and with a new identity, meeting a widow with two small children in a store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is okay as horror movies but it feels like the same old serial killer movie you see all the time. I thought Dylan Walsh did a pretty good job as the killer but there just wasn't any scary moments in the movie. I know it's probably hard to be original with all the horror movies out there but this just wasn't a scary movie. The acting wasn't very good. I find that the mom would believe a guy she only knew for a few months over her best friend especially after she knew the guy was hurting her son. I thought for the guy to have killed at least two times before he made a lot of mistakes. I thought it was stupid to go around killing everybody too and the only reason they did that was to keep the movie scary which obviously didn't work. If you want to watch a serial killer movie that's actually scary watch the Saw movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After six seasons of nipping and tucking, Dylan Walsh changes his pace - if only a little bit - strangulating and bludgeoning people, preferably whole families, instead. Which again makes you wonder: Why does Hollywood remake a film that has fan favorite status and was perfectly cast, perfectly written and perfectly directed the first time around? Ah yes, because it can. The results here are tepid even for undemanding audiences. The thesps are giving it their best, though, with especially Penn Badgley chipping in a balanced and believable performance. Two years ago, helmer McCormick blessed us with another so-so retelling of another classic cheapo - "Prom Night" - he should've learned his lesson back then.</fullReview>

I think everyone knows the plot of the movie. Single mom, Susan, meets dream guy, David, whom isn't really as nice as he appears to be. In fact, he's psychotic and likes to kill his families when they start catching on to the fact he isn't whom he says he is.So, there's the demise of the cat lady, Susan's ex hubby, and Susan's snoopy friend that got David a job and finds it odd he won't give any personal info. The film could have made David a little more creepy when dealing with the 2 youngest kids and Michael's girlfriend, Kelly.The whole film was just too tame.FINAL VERDICT: I would suggest watching the original for a better film and more suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Michael (Penn Badgley) returns home from military school to find his mother shacked up with new guy David Harris (Dylan Walsh) who has a troubled history of his own he hasn't told any of them about- namely, he shacks up with family after family before butchering them and making off as if he never existed. As aspects of his past fail to add up, Michael and his girlfriend Kelly (Amber Heard) start to dig deeper into the man he really is- a move which throws them into harm's way in more ways than they could imagine.All sorts of dross still finds itself onto the shelves despite being quite obvious direct to DVD junk. A film with a title as corny as The Stepfather would have looked naff enough in the video era, but someone must think there's some sort of audience for it. In fact, it's laughability is one of it's selling points, in a 'so bad it's entertaining' kind of way (check out the still on the back cover with Sela Ward's mother character, screaming in terror but looking more like she's won the lottery.) Aside from this, it's notable for having Dylan Walsh in the lead role, an actor I haven't heard about in quite a while, here showing he's competent delivering darker roles.The Stepfather benefits from a haunting, creepy opening, as the dour Christmas tune Silent Night plays over Walsh's character calmly going about things with the corpses of his latest victims (including children!) lying all around him. And to be fair, through-out Walsh maintains an air of darkness and intensity about him. Yet somehow the film fails to come together and be really effective. It just doesn't manage a consistent tone through out, meaning none of it manages to be really seat edge, hard when it's all so predictable anyway. It's been done before (anyone remember the similarly dreadful Domestic Disturbance?) and when everything has worked itself out, it leaves you with an ending some may find objectionable with everything that's gone on. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a Lifetime original movie given the Hollywood treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it's one thing Horror and Thriller aficionados can't stand it's watered down movies from either of those genres. These kind of films are supposed to tap into our greatest fears and keep us on the edge until the very end, right? Hollywood used to get that, but now it seems some people in the business are clueless. This applies to some of the recent remakes, but fortunately not all of them. Some have turned out to be pale imitations of their predecessor that don't just not match the impact of the original, but lack one of their own as well. 'The Stepfather' became a hit on video and gained some serious critical acclaim, but considering it's relative obscurity it's surprising it was picked up to be redone. Though a remake wasn't really necessary, the idea of updating this story was fairly interesting and had potential. Too bad the makers of the film didn't have what it takes to help it meet that potential.Pros: Universally strong cast. Fast paced from beginning to end. Pretty good score. Some decent tension here and there. The filmmakers do a good job of not making this a word for word scene for scene kind of remake. Exciting finale.Cons: Suspense is absent. You'll see almost everything coming. Some disposable characters. Script is cluttered with subplots that don't really go anywhere. Also it's pretty simplistic and lacks the meat of the original. Forgettable.Final thoughts: After watching this pretty mediocre update of the 1987 classic I think the makers of this one should have watched the two sequels and learned that you just can't top or even equal the original. Like I said there was potential in this idea, but this project needed someone with real guts and experience. An easy watch for a lazy afternoon. Just watch the original instead, even if you've seen it a hundred times.My rating: 2.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It barely works...but it does work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this remake we see Dylan Walsh taking over the role of the stepfather. In the original it was my boy John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). This remake is just one of many to come out in recent years and it also succumbs to the PG-13 rating that has been plaguing horror fans since these remakes hit the scene. The Stepfather is not horrible, but it doesn't try to be memorable either. It's generic and caters to the young teenage crowd. With the exception of Dylan Walsh, who does his best in this creepy role, the film lacks any kind of punch. The characters we are introduced to are poorly written and the choices of actors to portray them doesn't help either. Amber Heard is great to look at, but what use is she here? She spends 90% of the time in a bikini near a pool, or in her underwear in her room. Sela Ward is the mother, who invites a strange man she has never met before to spend time with her and her kids after meeting him in a grocery store. 6 months later, she is getting married, but doesn't bother to ask him about his past life? No pictures, or I.D.? It was interesting to watch the stepfather (who really isn't the stepfather, more like the mom's boyfriend) try to keep things together, especially when it seemed like his plans were falling apart. Walsh has that sinister look to him and just enough charm to pull off the role. I can't really say the same for anyone else in the film.The clichés are all here in this film. Cell phones that always have low battery, villains who are mortally wounded, but keep fighting at 100%, pretty young ladies in danger, characters who choose not to believe the truth even though it is right in front of their eyes.The film is predictable and goes through the motions. All the deaths are boring, but I never expected them to be over exaggerated. I can't really recommend this film, maybe for fans of remakes or the young teenagers who really dig these types of films. It's not horribly bad, but it's not worth the time to go out a grab a copy either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak Remake That Plays It's Cards Too Soon...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted-I haven't seen the original STEPFATHER in probably 20 years (a situation that I'll rectify soon in order to better gauge this film...)-but I recall enjoying the original quite a bit as a youngin'. After recalling my nostalgic feelings for the original-and also being a fan of NIP/TUCK-I was sorta lookin' forward to this remake.Dylan Walsh (who plays plastic-surgeon Sean McNamara on NIP/TUCK) plays 'the stepfather' in question who is a serial-killer looking for the 'perfect family'. The storyline takes place during the stepfather's search for his next perfect scenario...I kept the above brief because there's really not much more to say about it to those that've either seen the original, or have any basic idea about what the plot is about. Walsh is a decent actor and does an admirable job with the material he's given-but everything seems to play out a little too quick and slick in this one. Again-I need to revisit the original-but I remember it being a little less 'blatant' as to how the story unfolds-and Terry O'Quinn (most notable nowdays from TV's LOST fame) was the quintessential 'stepfather'. Again-I think Walsh did well with what he was given-but the screenplay just isn't tight enough for his performance to save this one. Not a bad popcorn-thriller, but otherwise un-noteworthy and extremely predictable in every way, and the crappy emo soundtrack is horrible to the point of distraction. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie. I didn't love it and I doubt you will to. Its pretty plain movie thats a lot like the movie "Disturbia" but with a killer who lives inside the home. It starts off with the story of how the stepfather has lived his life thus far and how he finds his new family. The natural rivalry between the stepfather and son is instant. The pair actually start out as somewhat friends but seem unsure of one another. The stepfather plays his role very well as this very likable seemingly perfect man. The mom takes to him like white on rice and denies any argument from her kids about him. He starts to find that his past catches up with him and decides to take out whomever gets in his way. He does strange things like always paying with cash and slips on his telling of his past family. Maybe a little to slowly the son starts to uncover everything and confirms his beliefs. A somewhat underrated movie that keeps you entertained from start to end. A fairly good selection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geeky Randy's summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Update of the 1987 film of the same name, with Walsh taking the title role. Walsh's stepfather is just as charming and just as convincingly psychotic as O'Quinn's was. The film starts out very promising, with a smart story and plenty of scares and creeps; but it begins to deteriorate when the hero (Bagley) is introduced, and who is even more unlikable than the purposely unlikable stepfather. The dark mood continues and the film remains watchable, until the middle of the film has passed and you realize that there's nothing building, only just an approaching climatic sequence which will probably be sudden, dull and disappointing. And as predicted, it is. Like "Disturbia" in a lot of ways, and shares similar pros and cons. Walsh doesn't really escape Dr. McNamara, but the passive-aggressive personality works well in this film. O'Quinn declined a cameo appearance.** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I am convinced of is that in the cinema, all insane serial killers are immortal. I was enjoying this film somewhat until about the last 15 minutes. There were a few things before then which were kind of far-fetched. But then things got more far-fetched and logic completely disappeared at the end of the film.At first, I thought that the film was making good use of cell phones and texting. And there was such a terrific occasion late in the film for a Hitchcock moment involving a cell phone, but the filmmakers didn't think to make use of it. But when no character thinks to call 9-1-1 from any kind of phone? It makes absolutely no sense.I think the generally competent cast did the best they could with a script with some major holes in it. It would be an OK kind of background noise when it comes on cable. But I would not recommend paying money to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who needs originality when there are still plenty of horrendous remakes to make?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With so little originality left, it is beginning to become very hard to spot what films are remakes and what films are simply rip-offs. When I first saw the trailer for The Stepfather, a fairly average looking thriller geared specifically at young teens, it fell into the category of me not being too sure what it was. It did not look like an original idea, and it looked like it was taking from other sources.The Stepfather (a remake of a 1987 film starring a pre-Lost Terry O'Quinn) revolves around the titular character played by Dylan Walsh. After a chilling opening sequence that sets up what kind of a sick psychopath this guy is, the film picks up with him going by the name David Harris and meeting the recently divorced Susan (Sela Ward) and most of her family. They hit it off well, and become engaged. Zoom six months into the future and Susan's degenerate son Michael (Penn Badgley) is freshly returned from a stint in military school. He does not immediately take to David, and as weird coincides and deaths begin occurring, Michael begins to obsess over who David really is.Taking pages from all sorts of horror and thriller films, The Stepfather outgrows its minuscule welcome all too quickly. The chilling opening sets up everything we need to know about David and what he eventually plans to do with his next victims. It too should set the tone for the whole movie. But instead it proves to be the gold standard that the rest of the film just cannot live up to.What follows is a series of just about everyone, including the dementedly clumsy serial killer, acting more stupid and silly as the film goes on. Are we really to believe this guy has never been caught simply because he pays with under the table cash for everything? Where is he getting all this money in the first place if there is basically no trace of him? Why does no one act like this is odd, outside of someone who wonders why he is not collecting Air Miles points? The film stinks of atrocious writing (and even worse dialogue), and offers up far too much curiosity over why no one has thought David's behaviour is odd well before Michael shows up and begins asking questions.Whereas films like Disturbia, its original Rear Window, and even director Nelson McCormick's own remake of Prom Night work on toying with the audience's perceptions of who may or may not be the killer, The Stepfather does away with all of that intensity and gives away everything that even would remotely suggest some sort of fear. When the camera spends an odd amount of time with anyone who is not David or a member of the family, we know they will bite the dust rather quickly. And when they do, it is supposed to be scary and thrilling. But how scary can strangulation be when we see it multiple times and are expecting it miles before it happens? The film feels like a set of minor setups, and no real payoffs. Every real plot development seems to go around in circles, giving very little resolution to anything that happens outside of the main members of the cast who are still standing by the film's finale. The tension that exists in the film seems to be there simply to annoy the audience into thinking the film will end a lot sooner than it does. The horror exists only because someone at Sony thought it was a good idea to remake the movie, and just throw together a PG-13 rated script that would potentially lure in the teenage audience and either offend or completely alienate the rest of the movie going public.As bad as the film is, I really feel for Walsh. He plays this disturbed and unhinged psychopath quite well, but the silly dialogue and ridiculous situations he finds himself in make him seem more over-the-top than he should. You can tell he at the very least looks like he is trying to deliver some sort of performance and ignore the horrendous predicament he finds himself in by even appearing in the film in the first place. But the film never lets him move past the written word, and in many cases, the film just seems to revel in making his performance more ludicrous than it should be. When it lets him breathe and he actually shows some hint of acting, he does very well. But in all other cases, he seems to just be mildly ahead of the rest of the cast.Speaking of that cast, they all are uniformly terrible. Ward plays the clueless mother thanklessly, and despite getting to be scared in one scene, keeps a look that is a cross between being happy and being totally baffled for the majority of the film. Badgley gets the most dialogue outside of Walsh, but he looks, sounds and acts like he walked off the set of another film. In one scene he is so intently focused on studying printouts from the America's Most Wanted website that he does not notice his girlfriend Kelly (Amber Heard) get up and leave. The scene perfectly describes his performance: intense focus, but not having any idea what's going on around him. As for Heard, she does absolutely nothing outside of looking fabulous in a bikini. But I am certain most people have already heard about how much less she wears in The Informers, so that selling point makes her even more useless mere moments in.I loved the opening scene in The Stepfather, but the film falls apart mere minutes after it happens. It is a terrible, unneeded remake, and outside of Walsh, no one really makes an effort to make it seem like it could be anything better. Avoid it like the plague.3/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepfather A Decent Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepfather is a decent remake with flaws but it's not the disaster I thought this film might be. Director Nelson McCormick does a good job of making this movie but the lack of more suspense, scares, and a rushed finale are what weighed it down for me. I wasn't so sure about Dylan Walsh as a serial killer but he actually did quite well in the role of a sociopath searching for the perfect family. On the outside his character David seemed like a charming kind average guy but underneath he's hiding a dark side. Walsh is effective showing both the charming side of his characters personality and the darkness that lies within him. Well done. Penn Badgley is good as Michael Harding who returns home from military school and begins to suspect that his mothers new boyfriend David isn't who he appears. Badgley is believable and convincing as the character. Amber Heard turns in a decent performance as Michael's girlfriend Kelly even though at times she isn't given much to do besides being there for eye candy. She's in a bikini for most of the movie and as a guy I'm not really complaining but there wasn't a whole lot of acting required. Heard however still delivers an above average performance. Sela Ward is effective as Michael's mom Susan and for a woman in her fifties she still looks very good. Jon Tenney is underused as Susan's ex-husband Jay only showing up for brief appearances here and there before being written out rather quickly but he still turns in a decent performance. The rest of the cast are okay but no one stands out. The movie does have some suspense but there could've been more and the violence committed by David are well executed. The beginning part of the film definitely shows just how ruthless he can be when his families disappoint him. The finale felt a little rushed and there were some yeah right moments but I was willing to suspend my disbelief. The ending certainly leaves the door open for a sequel which might or might not happen considering *spoiler* David lives at the end whose still searching for that perfect family. Overall despite some flaws The Stepfather is a decent remake with some suspense, drama, and good performances by the cast (Walsh and Badgley) who make this film worth the time to watch at least once. So if you liked the original you'll probably enjoy this one too. It's sure to please almost any fan of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband didn't think this was such a bad movie but there were some things that didn't make much sense. He originally killed the first family at Christmas time, then when the police were talking they said it had been 6 months since those murders and didn't know where he was. So when it first showed he was in Oregon it was probably right around June... Then it showed him with the new family 6 months after he had met them at the super market. Now if my calculations are right..... Shouldn't it have been right around Christmas as well? Which means that in the state of Oregon where we are originally from there is NO WAY you could be swimming. And it was way to sunny to be ORegon. Just a little food for thought since it pretty much rains their ALL THE TIME! Just something that kind of bothered us. People should put a lot more thought into things like that because it kind of ruins the movie for people that know about the areas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "enabler" for all the mayhem gets off "scot free!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1987 STEPFATHER, based on family killer John List, had two sequels and two television movie remakes BEFORE this horrendous current release was misbegotten. Why did we go to see it, you might ask? Well, it was the only thing playing at the local multiplex that fit our schedule. Plus, one could always hope "the fifth time is the charm," and that THIS TIME those involved could come up with at least a three-star-out-of-four or 7-of-10 rated film (which would have topped the other misfires). Alas, no such luck! Even for a $1 million, direct-to-video production in the two-for-a-buck rental section, this mess would have constituted a clear waste-of-time-and-money rip-off. The ONE THING that could have salvaged a SMIDGEN of audience satisfaction would of been to see the ENABLER for the serial killer's current round of domestic mayhem receive her JUST DESSERTS at the climax. Unfortunately, this character comes away smelling like a rose, playing out the one-month-later how-is-she-now? scene apparently no worse for wear, evidently no sadder and certainly no wiser for the experience of bringing death to a large swath of her family and neighbors. Three thumbs down!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great time and very worthy flick. Be sure to give it a chance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this by saying (apologetically) that I have not seen the original film of the same title (the 1987 version with the always brilliant Terry O'Quinn). Therefore, I can't compare this movie to that one. As a bit of a film buff, it generally takes a good story, good acting, good character development, good production value and a healthy combination of all these factors to get me really involved in a movie. I am pleased to say that this is a disturbingly tense and deliciously entertaining little film.Although the story isn't entirely original (the previous film had a similar concept), the fantastic acting was enough in this case. Penn Badgley (Gossip Girl) plays Michael Harding, a young man who after several months at military school, comes home to find his recently divorced mother (Sela Ward) engaged to David Harris (Dylan Walsh, Nip/Tuck), a man he's never met and doesn't know. At first, the man who has quickly ingratiated himself into this family seems mild and relatively harmless. Before long, however, and after a series of suspicious events, Michael starts to suspect there is more to his future Stepfather than meets the eye. Penn Badgley is wonderful, down to earth and very relateable as the cautious teenager who is torn between following his gut instinct or what everyone else is telling him. Dylan Walsh is very, very scary in this role, quite a change from the nice guy Sean McNamara we've come to know on 6 seasons of Nip/Tuck. Whether or not you are familiar with his work he will scare the bejesus out of you here.I won't say anymore in regard to story so as not to spoil it for anyone who has yet to see it, but I had a blast watching this movie. I was immediately pulled in from the get go an found myself gripping my theater seat during the climatic final act. Incredible acting by both Badgley &amp; Walsh make this movie a must-see for any fan of the suspense/thriller genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great cliché sample</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be the most predictable horror movie I've ever seen (and I use the word "horror" lightly). Every time there's a closeup of someone's face and the shot is slightly to one side, you can guarantee there'll be a killer behind them. When the old woman is pushed down the stairs, my whole theater laughed out loud. The fact that it wasn't enough for the kid to think his stepfather was a killer when he saw him in the basement through the vents checking his missing dad's cell phone, but when the kid himself suddenly is missing a picture he took of his stepfather on his cell phone, then it's time to freak out, because that is a sure indication a new family member is a killer.Then there are the unnecessary shots of the young teen-aged couple who always happen to be in bathing suits because I think Nelson McCormick must get off on that kind of thing. They must get sick of swimming at some point?! And of course, the ending, the wannabe "false climax." Sela Ward locks herself in the bathroom when her new husband starts coming after her with a knife, and as he's trying to bust down the door, he knocks the mirror off the door. Understandable, right? THEN he finally knocks the door in and gets in the room. Sela Ward has a piece of shattered glass in her hand and is wielding it against the much stronger, very built man who has killed numerous people before with knives. She stabs him in the neck (I have no knowledge as to how he didn't just stab her first) and he falls into the bathtub with a shard of glass protruding from his neck. She then meets with her son and her son's girlfriend in the kitchen and they decide they need to leave, when all of a sudden, BOOM: there's the killer! But wait...didn't he get stabbed in the neck? And that must've severed numerous arteries which would cause severe internal bleeding...but oh well, he's back, and with only a little splotch of blood on his neck.And my last complaint is merely how cheap the transition from movie to credits looked. I felt like I was watching "Beverly Hills Cop": suddenly, there was a single still shot and the credits all faded in at once. And the god-awful version of that famous song by The Turtles done by Filter is playing and it just doesn't fit, and ugh.Save the 9.50. Don't go see this film. Only way you should willingly decide to watch it is if you stream it on Netflix for FREE. Don't pay anything. Anything more than a cent is a waste on this clichéd piece of crap.Evren Buyruk from USA</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a change of pace for Dylan Walsh, seen as Poppy Montgomery's love-interest and strong minded cop Al.In this film he plays a murderous psychopath who marries widows or divorcees and then proceeds to kill families.One woman in Portland, Oregon immediately falls for him and he moves in. Her eldest son, who has been a problem, immediately suspects that something is amiss, and of course we have the younger son being hit by Walsh.Walsh seeing that various people are suspicious, begins his murderous rampage with a nosy neighbor, the woman's ex-husband and her sister becoming victims.The fighting finale on the roof is tense, but with all Life-time films, these culprits seem to get away and as the film ends, they are ready to continue their mayhem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather bland and troubling remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Returning home from military school, a teen discovers his mom's new boyfriend will go to extreme lengths to keep a psychotic image of the perfect family together, and that he and his family are in big trouble when he fears that he's going on another rampage.This here turned out to be quite the bland and unimpressive thriller. Most of the problems here stem from the fact that this whole film is based on set-up rather than horror actions, which just drags this one out to ludicrous lengths in order to sell the overall storyline. Since there's a large portion of time spent on the family used to him while he not only has to adjust to life back home again but also to her new man as well, which takes forever to get going in the first half the film really seems quite bland and overall a struggle. Once it gets to the introduction of the alternate identity and his past there's a rather big stumbling block in how badly this stretches out his secret from them by making his instability so obvious with the different secrets and explosive outbursts attempting to hold everything back from getting out is a lot of work needed trying to build something that doesn't really need as much to accomplish this rather simplistic turn. There's nothing here that warrants stretching out the investigation to the point it gets to here where it has him coming up with something that legitimately should've exposed him only to have it shot down unnecessarily on the most utterly flimsy points possible which feels quite lame and clearly screams being there to pad out the running time here when this one should've just let it out with the actual realization of his attitude and truth for everything which is quite a big struggle to understand what's going on. This here really holds back the slasher elements down to the point where instead the thriller aspect here is kept up to such a dominant angle that there's very little of the film that holds it's interest at all which keeps this one so dragged-out holds this down quite readily. Capped off with a series of lame, utterly bloodless and unnaturally tame series of kills and a lack of sex-appeal despite plenty of opportunity featuring this intention which really lowers this one even further, these here keep this down to the point of not really making the positives mean anything. The few positives here really stem from the film's final half which is when this one gets going with the stalking and battling him off. There's some fun with the final clue needed to fully piece the puzzle together and leading into the big chase and stalking around the house up into the attic which is admittedly creepy and gets enough action and energy going that it comes off quite nicely even with the clichéd resolution. As well, though it takes way too long to unfold it features a strong outline of how he gets found out, as the different methods built up to get him out are quite good in principle that gives this a little extra. Still, the other flaws here hold this one back considerably.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and themes of child violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty predictable movie. What is frustrating is the lack of common sense the wife has regarding her children. When they mention their dislike for her new husband, their stepfather, she says be happy for her. Always about her. You kind of figure out why her first husband left her.The stepfather walks around with this threatening look on his face with the entire family. That the wife cannot see her obvious miss-match is pretty silly. Actors are attractive, especially the son's girlfriend in her bikinis and underwear, all playing their roles like they were bored with it all. They and the director did the best they could with a re-hash of the original. But the script remains silly and rather stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you, like me, did see the original "The Stepfather" movie, then chances are that you most likely will find this movie to be a totally unnecessary remake. While this 2009 version is in itself entertaining and thrilling enough to keep the audience on the edge of their seats, it is a movie that the cinema could have been well enough without.The story is about a killer who preys upon families without a father in the frame, where he movies in, settles in and then kills them when they have served their purpose.The movie is nicely filmed and cleverly set up to thrill the audience, which director Nelson McCormick did quite well.Carrying this movie almost entirely by himself was Dylan Walsh, in the role of the deviant stepfather.The 2009 version is good for those who haven't already seen the original movie from 1987. But for us who have, it was a 'why was this remade?' moment.But all in all an entertaining movie and good thrill ride, with some fairly good moments to keep the viewers on the edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stepfather (2009): Dir: Nelson McCormick / Cast: Dylan Walsh, Penn Badgley, Sela Ward, Amber Heard, Sherry Stringfield: Pathetic remake about intrusion. In this case, a very stupid horror movie intruded upon our cinemas. Michael arrives home from military school but has suspicions regarding his mother's fiancé. Premise is rushed just so that new dad David can prevent several people from exposing him then having a cliffhanger ending. Director Nelson McCormick is backed by fine production but terrible writing. It is written like your average stupid slasher flick and has all the ambition of a sloth in the mid day sun. Dylan Walsh as David is too ominous at the wrong times thus becoming a prop. Penn Badgley as Michael is there to suspect and eventually fight. After all, he is from the military for a reason. The writers wanted a big fight. Wow. The brain power that went into this. Sela Ward plays his "rush into relationship mother." She has all the mentality of a cement block. She will also not suspect a thing, which makes her all the stupider. Amber Heard plays his over sexed girlfriend who has all the mentality of a blowup doll. The film that inspired this crap is hardly a hard core classic and this will never be nothing more than a predictable charade of violence and about as much creativity as a pile of dog sh*t. This film should be stepped on, by an elephant. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining thriller, mainly toward end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of this movie has a disturbing contrast. Nice Christmas decorations and a beautiful version of "Silent Night" sung by what may be a boys' choir, and dead bodies lying beside the decorations. The man who apparently committed the murders is on his way to terrorize another family.Susan and "David" meet at the grocery store and are immediately attracted to each other. Soon, Michael comes home from military school where he was sent because he caused trouble, along with his intelligent and gorgeous girlfriend Kelly. He is not happy with the new addition to the family. Neither is his father Jay.Over time, David tries to develop a relationship with Michael, but it is hard. Meanwhile, Susan's sister Jackie gives David a job without bothering to do a background check. David has no past, however, and he keeps making excuses. People start finding out his stories are lies. And whenever anyone points out his suspicious behavior, or his resemblance to a killer who has not been found ... well, you just don't want to be around David when he's alone and you have provoked him.A nosy neighbor dies suspiciously, and Jay also mysteriously disappears. Michael and Kelly investigate, and Kelly takes advantage of every opportunity to show how good she looks in a bikini or underwear. Still, she does have brains too.The movie starts out pleasant enough, almost family-friendly. But it soon gets quite exciting. The final action scene is quite entertaining, and based on something I read in user reviews, could have been even more so without the deletion of a particularly well-done stunt.As a thriller this could have been better. Everything seems almost normal, which is fine. I like normal. But if this was actually a feature film, it doesn't seem like one. It seems like a Lifetime woman-in-jep movie. I like those, so I was reasonably happy.Dylan Walsh gives a good enough performance, but by the end he is going beyond the ordinary.Sela Ward is a respected actress and she does just fine here, but there isn't anything particularly distinctive. She does look good, despite her ex's comments about why he was attracted to other women.Amber Heard gives a good performance, but I think that's mainly because she doesn't mind showing off her body and shows confidence when she does.Penn Badgley does a capable job too.It was entertaining enough. Just don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I stayed up late on a work night to watch this and I'm disappointed. That's 90 minutes of my life I won't get back. The whole movie seemed to lack suspense. It was advertised as a slasher movie, but it contained no gore and the most pathetic excuse for violence. It was almost laughable. I feel like they blew the whole budget on Amber Heard's bikinis and underwear, so they couldn't afford any really good bloody or gruesome SFX. There was no story arc whatsoever, it just didn't seem like it was snowballing into this incredible edge-of-your-seat suspense, he ended up killing everyone in such obvious and stupid ways, there were some scenes that could have been made to be incredible, but they were cut short and you didn't really know what happened. Even the ending was anti- climatic. Personally I don't know how a serial killer who interacts with the victims families and close personal friends can evade capture. This is 2009 America, surely the man was caught on CCTV somewhere? I just found the whole story unbelievably boring and far fetched. A man deleted a photo you took of him off your phone and you deduce that he's a serial killer? Right until the final showdown, I was wondering when the suspense and drama would kick in.</fullReview>

The storyline is great, so is the acting, though Penn's character and his girlfriend's were both kind of used as show-pieces, as in, they were put in the movie to add some naked-spice. I mean, it was like the two of them could never be together and wear clothes at the same time! Other than that point-less skin-exposure, the movie was great and had quite a few grasping moments!

		<fullReview>I wasn't as big a fan of the original "The Stepfather" movie as some people are, but it sure looks better to me after watching this remake. The cast does try hard, but they can't overcome the fact that there is not much here. The director's main ambition, instead of trying to generate suspense and jolts, seems to be to make the movie look pretty. The movie looks too polished and slick; the original movie used its low budget to add some serious grit. But the real problem with this movie is that it is too slow and by the numbers. You'll be able to guess ever so-called plot turn before it actually happens. There's no suspense as a result, which may explain why the climax is set during a violent rainstorm, to try and generate atmosphere. It doesn't work, and neither does the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Harris (Dylan Walsh) is the stepfather from hell. He kills his stepkids and new wife. It's not even be his first kills, and each time, he gets a new identity. His next target is Susan Harding (Sela Ward) and her kids. Six months later, her oldest son Michael (Penn Badgley) returns home after military school to find David living with the family. Michael's longtime girlfriend is Kelly Porter (Amber Heard), and he doesn't get along with his father Jay (Jon Tenney). David gets a job at Susan's friend Jackie Kerns (Paige Turco)'s realty company. Things work relatively well at first. When an elderly neighbor notices the resemblance between David and a police wanted sketch, David starts killing once again.This is a relatively professionally made B-movie. Dylan Walsh does a good creepy guy while still has that leading man look. Sela Ward is protesting too much at all the evidence. These are cookie cutter characters and not really that well thought out. Penn Badgley is not the most likable actor. And for some reason, Amber Heard is always wearing a bikini. I'm not complaining but it becomes very noticeable. In the end, this movie lacks something compelling to interest me. There is no mystery since the stepfather is shown as a serial killer right away. The movie is mapped out right from the start. The family isn't likable enough to maintain rooting interest. This is professionally made but not much more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(10%) An immensely pointless waste of time and effort, that amounts to almost nothing, and it even takes way too long in getting there. This may have worked as a hour long TV show or maybe short film, but that would have depended upon a large overall improvement, as well as a change to both the script and the production, as there just isn't anything to this at all. If you really want to tone down the violence to your horror movie, as this does, which can actually be fine, then you need to offer something else in terms of tension, or mood, but this doesn't even have any of that, and it's not as if it is trying and failing because there's about half the movie's run time devoted to non-horror based elements. We see tons of the elder son and his girlfriend frolic in the pool, quite a bit of them all having dinner, and them attending some family parties, but only about 15-20 minutes of anything that even resembles horror. And even though this is solidly shot, and far from utterly unwatchable, there's still no getting away from how truly worthless this is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable psycho-thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, a warning: THE STEPFATHER is a remake of a 1980s horror film starring Terry O'Quinn (from LOST) as the murderous family member. That original film was actually very good, and spawned two lesser sequels before being resurrected for this noughties-era revamp.It's many years since I saw (and loved) the original film, so I can't really comment on similarities or disparities between the two movies. However, I can report that this new film is surprisingly effective, even when it's saddled with a PG-13 rating. It blows many other PG-13 thrillers (such as the lacklustre THE GLASS HOUSE) out of the water.Dylan Walsh proves to be more than effective as the kindly family man who turns out to hide a murderous secret, and while the screenplay never gets as dark - or explicit - as I would have liked, the suspense levels remain high throughout. The actual lead turns out to be the teenage son, played effectively (although without much sympathy) by Penn Badgley, although the award for best scene-stealer goes to Amber Heard, who parades around in a bikini for her ENTIRE running time.The murder scenes are well handled and the direction is for the most part acceptable, a surprise given that Nelson McCormick also handled the disappointing PROM NIGHT remake. THE STEPFATHER is one of the better remakes out there and while it doesn't have much in the way of rewatchability it certainly passes the time for both horror and thriller fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about this movie is its premise - a man trying to make the perfect family with some rather unusual methods. The second best is Dylan Walsh as "The Stepfather". The man is truly a gifted actor, veering from bland affability to ice-cold fury at the flick of a switch. Director Nelson McCormick (who also remade "Prom Night", with much less success), has a pretty good sense of when to back off and let the scriptwriters and Walsh take over.Unfortunately, it's pretty obvious McCormick is trying to have the best of both worlds. The scares are low-key and predictable - for example, Michael's younger siblings are far away from all the peril and bloodshed in the climax. One gets the sense that he's hedging his bets with this movie. However, Penn Badgley (Michael) and Amber Heard (Kelly)do have some pretty good chemistry as the slow-to-doubt teens, and Sela Ward (Susan) does a convincing acting job herself, with an optimism that becomes concern as David/"The Stepfather"'s masquerade of perfection begins to crumble. All in all, this movie can't really be called incompetent, grimly clueless, or even actively bad - however, it is a bit unnecessary and definitely unimpressive when compared to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Routine remake but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original stepfather was my ultimate classic from the 80s. Sure I discovered the movie a little late, but I also seen 'Poison Ivy' and 'The Orphan' prior to this so it takes away the novelty. The original is a classic as it set the standard for this sort of concept. Other movies just followed in it's path but didn't manage to offer anything new. This remake seemed like a more newer updated version. I personally feel that it came a little late and the subject was too routine for this decade of cinema.The main character didn't come across as frightening than compared to Terry O Quinn. He reminded me a lot Kurt Russell. He neither managed to press on the fear button. However his performance as the deranged stepfather was convincing but underplayed it to a smaller extent. The character of the son made the movie slightly interesting. It was due to his presence which made me watch on. His constant confrontations and hide and seek games always set in the suspense factor. However this did not make him exempt from character flaws. His constant attempts and methods to expose the truth about his new stepfather was so lame to the point of stupidity. If you're going to discreetly enter the bedroom to uncover some dirt relating to the past history, at least tell Amber Heard to keep an eye on the driveway.Throughout the movie there are endless on the edge and suspenseful moments. The first half the lead character becomes introduced to all the family members and the second part concentrates on taking the story forward. If you're keen to see Amber Heard in a bikini, this will add to the appeal factor. She has a supporting role however doesn't add much to the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Stepfather" is a competent - though somewhat superfluous - remake of the relatively well-received horror flick of the same name (I mean, is it really necessary to be doing-over films from the '80s already?). As in the previous venture, the main character (Dylan Walsh) is a serial killer who woos unsuspecting young women (in this case, Sela Ward) with children into letting him move in as a apart of the family, then coldly dispatches them in a gruesome display of bloodletting and violence.The major difference between this version and the previous one is that the oldest child (Penn Badgley), who becomes convinced of the stepfather's true identity over time, has been changed from a daughter in the original to a son here, just as the daughter's psychiatrist has been converted into a lesbian aunt (Paige Turco) for this version. Otherwise, the premise and the execution are virtually the same.As written by J.S. Caldone and directed by Nelson McCormick, "The Stepfather" is a relatively straightforward, conventional and restrained horror movie, heavier on the plot mechanics than on the blood. There are times when the characters are almost absurdly na?ve and get themselves into predicaments that a few moments of cautious forethought might have helped them to avoid. Heck, even the killer himself is prone to some pretty dumb moves at times, especially for a man who has ostensibly been plotting out his every move for years now.That being said, "The Stepfather" can't really help but pull you in, even with a somewhat lackluster climactic scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Not Bad Thriller Remake!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dyan Walsh, Sela Ward and Penn Badgley star in this 2009 thriller remake of the 1987 film. This begins with a mysterious man (Walsh) changing his identity after brutally murdering his family. He soon becomes real-estate agent, David Harris who meets a woman, Sara Harding (Ward) and becomes part of her family. He eventually meets her oldest and troubled son, Michael (Badgley) who has just returned home from military school. Michael sees that David is a nice guy longing for the perfect family, but suspects he's not who he seems. David tries to keep it together until Michael and others get in his way. This isn't a bad remake, Dylan is great in it and I like both his and Terry O'Quinn's portrayals. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do these types of thrillers need to be so... weak? Clichés, clichés. clichés, and not the fun type of clichés. The script is so thin, so weak, the film has no blood or anything. Yes, the film does entertain a bit, but to me these types of films always leave something for me to see. This could have been a really good horror film though if it was done a lot more effectively and dramatically. The only good performer here is Dylan Walsh, and he barely was able to work because the script gave him almost nothing. He played the one-note character very well though and I think he is the reason it at least entertained me. But still, why can't writers and directors make something a little more ambitious? I can't imagine ANYONE loving this film because even horrors fans will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Susan Harding(Sela Ward)is an attractive and lonely widow with children. One, Michael(Penn Badgley), returns home from military school to find his mother has a live-in boyfriend David(Dylan Walsh). On first appearances David seems a likable and charming guy. But this ultimate nice guy has a past on the darker side. Pretending to be the ideal husband and stepfather, David has an ulterior motive when picking out Susan at the grocery store. David seems to have a bad habit of changing families like some people change houses. Michael begins delving into David's past to discover some possible deviate and psychotic activities. There is now an awkward feeling when you hear that "Daddy's home".Walsh makes himself pretty easy to dislike. Ward is good at what she does; but her friend Jackie(Paige Turco)is a stone fox. Also in the cast: Jon Tenney, Skyler Samuels and Amber Heard. Violence is pretty ordinary and the chills were at a minimum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was moved to write this review because I nearly didn't watch the movie because of the low rating it received here. I found it a very watchable movie. OK it isn't going to change your life but it is gripping in parts and has good ongoing tension.At the very start of the film we know that the Stepfather (David Harris played by Dylan Walsh) is a killer. Other reviewers here have commented that the movie is predictable - obviously have some justification. But then a little bit of predictability can actually add to the tension. You know that something awful is going to happen so you are willing the characters, particularly the son, Michael Harding (played by Penn Badgley), to do something before it is too late.I am confused as to why this movie has received such bad reviews. I am wondering whether it is because there is not very much (or even any?) blood and gore. The opening scene has dead bodies of a family on the floor with no obvious sign of injury. We only see a tiny spot of blood on David Harris's face. This seems to be because he has cut himself shaving. Perhaps a little ironic that that is the only mark on him after a terrible killing spree. I do not find it necessary to have graphic scenes of violence to enjoy tension in a movie and I think that there will be a number of other people, like me, that would like the style of this movie. The movie is more about the subtleties of an apparently charming character revealing the occasional chilling look or ominous comment - hinting at the psychopathic nature within.</fullReview>

First class acting, direction and music makes this a top rated film even though the storyline could be said to be formulistic. Well Romeo and Juliet is formulistic and the plot of it repeated many times but most people will not tire of that, and the same came be said for this picture too.The star of the show is Dylan Walsh , the stepfather, yet all the players give convincing and believable performances. I like the way modern technology is used in the story namely, the internet and smart phone.Looking forward to Stepfather 2.This movie merits: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepfather, modern horrors newest failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywoods fascination with the infamous horror remake genre has again plummeted to new lows with this installment to the clique. Polished up for a modern look with new younger, hip actors/actresses with the hopes of appealing to a new audience that has never seen the original (as is the modus operandi of all the recent remakes), but again has failed to deliver the two key aspects needed for such a feat...quality and substance.Suspension of disbelief is a needed trait for most horror films, but I'm sorry, trying to believe that Penn Badgley is a going into his senior year of high school seems even worse than 90210's peak cast years.Amber Heard is very easy on the eyes but after the 10th scene of her in either her underwear or bikini, I started to question, does she own any actual clothes? The film seemed rushed with little attempt to build up any suspense. Character development is non existent in most regards. As in all horror films, especially remakes, I go into them with the expectation of seeing a "B" quality film, if it turns out better, then thats gravy for me. Stepfather 2009 failed to reach that expectation. This was simply put an exploitation film of Amber Heard and a failure in everyway to improve upon the original. As in most horror cases, stick to the original which provided tension and atmosphere which was obviously absent here.Reverend Killtaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, but the lack of violence and the PG rating hurts this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepfather made for an effortless watch, I was entertained at points but it's so watered down compared to the original, and the original isn't even a classic itself. It starts off with a pretty creepy opening, very much echoing the original but in the end I feel it could have been so much more. Dylan Walsh made for a very creepy Stepfather, not ruining Terry O'Quinn's legacy or anything like that, but the lack of sympathetic characters here, and the fact that it goes into standard slasher/thriller mode in the finale, very disappointingly routine stuff. The original Stepfather as I said wasn't a classic, but it managed to create a lot of suspense and it had quite a bit of graphic violence, this has a bit of suspense here and their, but the P.G rating prevents it from doing anything significant. In the original I was able to care for the characters for a fair amount, here I really didn't care who lived or died, they were all throwaway characters to me.Performances. Dylan Walsh is excellent as The Stepfather, he's the reason to watch this movie. His creepy stare, his intensity made for very creepy times. Sela Ward is OK as the Mom, but her character grated me a bit with how naive she was. Penn Badgley is OK as well, but I had no reason to root for his character, and his attitude often rubbed me the wrong way. Amber Heard is wonderful eye-candy, but that's about it.Bottom line. This is pretty much average stuff all the way around. It's watchable, it passed the time decently, but that's all I can really recommend this as is a one time watch.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's say that the last years Hollywood is remaking those old classics. But most of them failed to be better than the original. What I just watched should be a remake of the hard searched after classic The Stepfather. A lot of money is given to find the OOP full uncut. I can tell that this one never will earn that reputation. It isn't b ad but to say horror, no. No blood flows even as it starts pretty well with the so called stepfather leaving his old house when he just murdered his family. Nice. But then it's all the way down just until the last 10 minutes. Nothing really happens. It's a typical teen horror were no blood flows, oh god were are the good old 80's. It's a lot of talking between the stepfather and the son. Because he fears that the son is investigating his past. What the movie delivers is a bikini girl. And be honest, for the most part that's the best to watch. She's got something mysterious over her, the reason why she played Mandy Lane. I'm talking about Amber Heard. I guess male youngsters watching this flick will see that something can go up...but it will fall down due the weakness of the movie. Why oh why all those remakes. It's one to watch in the afternoon before your pizza and having the real stuff afterwards. It's so sad to see how producers and writers go for the easy money, put a babe in your movie, just show some bikini shots and you are finished, yeah, finished for me those guys are!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lame remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not find it to be very memorable, but I understand why the film The Stepfather found a moderate success back in 1987.The slasher cinema cycle was on decadence, saturated with masked imitators of Jason Voorhess, whose idea of "innovation" consisted on using new kitchen utensils in order to commit the murders.So, in that context, it was different to present the appearance of the "stepfather", a sober, realistic and disturbingly normal villain.And besides, it offered two solid performances: one of them was from the always brilliant Terry O'Quinn in the leading role; and the other one was from Jill Schoelen as the "final girl", a promising actress who was proclaimed by some people in that time as the next Jamie Lee Curtis.22 years later, the remake of that film was made, and even though there have been worse remakes (like Prom Night or Black Christmas), it is still a lame and tedious movie in which I wasted my time.The only positive element I found on The Stepfather was the performance from Dylan Walsh, because he feels credible on his role.As the "hero", we have the bland Penn Badgley, who feels truly irritating.And sure, the absence of an attractive heroin (as in the original film) created the necessity of new "visual attractive"...a work which fell on Amber Heard, who was condemned to interpret most of her scenes using a bikini or underwear.Heard is attractive, but such an obvious and gratuitous strategy cheapens the movie, and it ends up leaving a bad taste...Was it really necessary to show so many discussions near the swimming pool?In summary, I do not recommend The Stepfather (2009) at all, mainly because the story never got me interested and the direction feels absolutely listless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Started off great but quickly fell flat....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching, The Stepfather, and I must say that I wish I had taken my dog for a walk instead. Also, I think I should add that I have NOT seen the original, so I am writing this solely based on seeing this film alone.The Stepfather actually had an intriguing opening sequence, which made it look promising. After changing his appearance in the mirror, for the who knows how many times, Dylan Walsh (David Harris) casually strolls downstairs and puts on some nostalgic Christmas music. Soon after we see the corpses of an unlucky mother and children strewn about the living room. He then proceeds to make himself a slice of toast with peanut butter and eats it calmly and casually. A close-up of blood covered tools in the sink indicates the family suffered violent deaths, on Christmas Day, no less. Very macabre and unsettling. This portrayed Dylan Walsh's character as an icy and remorseless man. Well done.Unfortunately, soon after the beginning, the rest of the film was full of clichés and plot holes and not much else. The rest of the characters were bland and boring. The obvious sexual exploitation by Nelson McCormick of Kelly( Amber Heard), although pleasing to the eye for a heterosexual male such as myself, was overdone and grew tiresome. She spent 95% of the movie in either a bikini or her underwear. Has this girl ever heard of pants?? Furthermore, I did not understand the lesbian side plot between Jackie (Paige Turco) and Leah (Sherry Stringfield). What did this have to do with anything?? Who cares?? Totally irrelevant within the film.Another goof I quickly spotted was when the cat lady, Mrs. Cutter, came over to tell Susan (Sela Ward) that she was watching America's Most Wanted and saw a sketch of a wanted serial murderer that resembled her new fiancée, David Harris (Dylan Walsh). Is this lady a complete moron?? Wouldn't any other sane and rational person, immediately call the police after seeing someone that might resemble a psychopath killer on America's Most Wanted, instead of going to the house where the guy lives to tell his fiancée only to get brushed off and just carry on like nothing happened?? Haha! Stupid! To sum it up, besides the great opening, the only good thing about this film was Amber Heard's perfectly formed anatomy, to which I will give 2 stars for. Other than that, it was predictable and lackluster. Bad camera work, bad acting, and a boring script make for a bad movie overall. Hope this review is helpful! Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Average Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the exceptional 1987 independent film lacks the suspense and character development of the original. Dylan Walsh delivers a good performance playing the title character, but his portrayal is not as nuanced as Terry O'Quinn from the original who would murder his step family because they could not live up to his idealized notion of the American family. The original was as much a metaphor for the superficiality of the American dream as it was a superb character study of a psychopath who managed to evoke sympathy. Walsh, on the other hand, is a fairly one dimensional villain. He kills not because his family disappoints him but because they are suspicious. They are no different than any one of his victims.The film also differs much from the original by not only changing the daughter into a son, but also by having the son carry the film. There is really no mystery or suspense since Badgley's mother and girlfriend believe that Walsh is the perfect man who is just dealing with his grief in unusual ways. Badgley starts to believe this too even when the clues begin to pile up. It is at this point where the film drags with only a few kills to break up the monotony. O'Quinn was far scarier throwing a tantrum than Walsh is sneaking up on little old ladies.At times, the film feels like a generic slasher since it ups the body count from the original. However, these victims serve little purpose other than proving how they are more intelligent than the main characters. This fact doesn't save them unfortunately. The film manages to achieve some moderate thrills in the final act, but the effect is cheapened by an unnecessary and implausible ending that hints at a sequel.I advise anyone interested in this film to watch the original before watching this. It is a well done psychological thriller with dark humor thrown in. This film, although fine for a rainy afternoon, is an ultimately forgettable movie that unfortunately wastes a fine cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made, but the ending...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people who didn't like this movie claim that it's nothing more than a rip off of 'Disturbia'.While it has the same look and almost relative plot, I thought that 'The Stepfather' wasn't a rip off at all.There's really no reason to dislike a movie if it has the same look as from another movie.I'll agree that there are some similarities, but there's also a huge difference.In 'Disturbia', the killer was a neighbor from across the street.Here, the killer is actually inside the house and that's what made the movie interesting.I was surprised when I found out that the director made the very underrated film 'Prom Night'.That film was released in 2008 and got horrible reviews.The director of that film actually manages to make a better movie.What really disappointed me was the ending.If you don't want to read the ending, then I suggest that you stop reading write now.In the end, the stepfather and the stepson fight each other, like 'Disturbia'.They fall out of the attic window and they appear to be dead.The son manages to wake out of a come and his mom tells him that the cops couldn't find the stepfather's body.After that scene, another different family meet the killer,who's obviously in disguise.The mother and killer shake hands and then the end credits roll.That I didn't like.What I did like was the overall movie, even if the ending was a bit unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible movie, and seriously should be taken off the circuit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having agreed with all of the criticisms of this film in these reviews, I am motivated to write something myself, because of the seriousness of one of the points below. To itemize some of the complaints so far:1. This is a typical Lifetime movie, but I found it on one of the so- called "better" movie channels. Was I disappointed.2. The two women closest to the action (mum and girlfriend) are unbelievably stupid in not seeing the danger, but continue to suggest there is no problem. If they had got killed themselves I would have had little sympathy for them.3. When the baddie is hit once and he is down, the victims never hit again and turn their backs on him, allowing the perp to get up again and continue his mayhem. This happens far too many times in Lifetime movies.4. There is no way the killer should get away at the end of the film, he should have been mangled to a pulp to give us all some satisfaction. Surely they do not think they are going to make a sequel!!?5. Very seriously, to use America's Most Wanted in this plot is sacrilege. AMW always insist anyone concerned should notify them, completely anonymously, and this should have been done in this film, or not use AMW at all. I would like to hear that AMW have complained.Unless, of course, AMW want to use this film as an indication of what might happen if someone does not report their suspicions.I do not mind watching crap movies if I have the time, but I do not want to be insulted. Take this film off the circuit, AMW!</fullReview>

The original Stepfather is a classic in my opinion, but this terrible excuse for a remake is well devoid of anything suspenseful or scary.Only recently I came round to seeing this remake after fighting the urge for a while now and when I did it just exceeded my low expectations. For a start it's just way too glossy and lacks anything remotely interesting, the new Stepfather Dylan Walsh just doesn't come across convincing in any way, I'm not saying he's a bad actor but in this he just doesn't seem comfortable definitely miscast. And the rest of the cast don't fare much better. Penn Badgely is the only one that does okay but given the rubbish material he gives, not even he can save this mess. Sela Ward well I enjoy her in TV movies but here she's just unlikeable and boring, and Amber Heard is just eye candy in this and nothing else, although she does have great chemistry with Penn Badgely.Even the final showdown is a complete mess and lacks any real tension well in other words just plain bland and watered down.All in all A complete shambles off a movie, even the Stepfather sequels were better than this, AVOID at all costs.</fullReview>

This criminal mind (David) --by now I suppose that "Spoilers" are unnecessary; anyway I won't reveal anything after 80 or so previous reviews that had revealed everything-- David, as I said, killed a whole family before the picture starts and we see that in flashbacks at the very beginning, no surprises here. He kills other people during the film, and probably he will kill a few dozen more in the next sequel and the future sequels. Is that the way we contemplate crime nowadays? One can kill whole families and walk free towards the bright horizon looking for the next victims to be butchered up?Is this a sort of brain washing programming to desensitize people so they will live in constant fear of the stranger and at the same time, remain indifferent to crime from overexposure, so they become accustomed to delinquency in the overpopulated cities of nowadays? It must be, because otherwise it's incomprehensible that a criminal like David remains free until the next remake. Very bad film.

There's a plot hole around every corner.Like, David does a really bad job at covering up his insanity. The mother is really stupid and ignores many, many clues that David isn't innocent. David does a really bad job hiding evidence. The police sketch artist scene was terribly written. Why would the third victim(can't remember her name) come outside to fix an UMBRELLA when she had a plane to catch? Seriously, out of all things she could have died doing, why was it fixing an umbrella? Not to mention they make it incredibly obvious that David was the killer from the first scene which takes all of the mystery out of it. They have mystery music where it's not needed. And the ending renders the entire film pointless. Overall the film sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stepfather, The (2009) ** 1/2 (out of 4)Remake of the 1987 cult film has Michael (Penn Badgley) returning home after a year in Military school and learning that his mother (Sela Ward) is living with a new man named David (Dylan Walsh). Michael tries to be open in regards to David but soon he and others start to wonder what all he's actually hiding. If you're familiar with the original film then you know he's hiding the fact that he likes to go around marrying women and killing them and their children. As far as remakes go this one here is pretty much in the middle. The movie isn't far from great but it's also far from being bad. I was never a huge fan of the original movie or its sequel, although it's been years since I last saw them. This one here does follow the same storyline and it doesn't offer anything new but at the same time it's well-made and features some pretty good performances. I think the film would have benefited from some editing because at 100-minutes it takes a while to get to where we know it's going to end. The film could have cut out many of the needless scenes of Michael and his girlfriend either kissing, talking or flirting around. I'm really not sure what was up with all these scenes but they add very little except for eye candy at the girlfriend who is usually in a bikini. The movie is a little watered down from the previous movie but the PG-13 rating doesn't hurt it too bad and especially since it tries to deliver more than just gore and violence like a lot of the recent remakes. The biggest plus are the actual performances with Walsh stepping into the role and doing a nice job with it. Walsh has always been a fine character actor so it was nice getting to see him play the lead and he does all he can do with it. I thought he was believing in the role as he worked well as the caring guy but also as the psycho. The real stand out for me was Ward who really shines and gives a complete and complex performance. Badgley, Amber Heard and Jon Tenney aren't too bad either. The plot of a woman moving someone she doesn't know into the house only to learn he's crazy wasn't original in 1987 and it's certainly not any more original in 2009. The movie is a long way from being a classic but there's enough here to warrant a $1 rental at Redbox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable thriller, one of the best remake/thrillers of 2009!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the original (&amp; STEPFATHER 2, somewhat in a few scenes) 1987 suspense thriller of the same name, that starred Terry O' Quinn, casts NIP/TUCK's own Dylan Walsh as David Harris, an ideal nice guy who appears to be the perfect stepfather for a woman &amp; her two young children &amp; her older son MICHAEL, who has just come back home after being away from his family for a while. However in Michael's eyes, his new soon to be stepfather appears to be too perfect &amp; soon Michael begins to wonder about him, especially when a rash of disappearances &amp; horrible "accidents" occur to those who try to dig up David's past, including Michael's real dad &amp; a nosey neighbour, who thinks David looks a little to much like a guy who murdered his family six months prior &amp; subsequently disappeared (gee I wonder if it's the same guy...) &amp; when Michael begins digging up information himself, he discovers some chilling secrets from David's past, but David knows Michael is getting to close to knowing his dark secrets, unfortunately like others who have tried to dig up things from David's past &amp; are beginning to realize who David actually is, Michael learns that David is determined to have the perfect family no matter what the cost is, he'll even be more than happy to kill whomever attempts to stop him from having such &amp; Michael just like David's past families &amp; enemies, is now starting to get on David's nerve, he's starting to disappoint him...You see folks if you're going to remake a classic film this is the way to do it! When I heard they were remaking the original STEPFATHER &amp; when I heard the mostly negative reviews from fans &amp; critics, I was a little worried. In fact I actually considered not seeing this movie, but being a film critic, I caved into seeing it anyways, mainly to keep up my reviews on the series up to date &amp; you know what? I strongly disagree with all the negative reviews. Now granted, I understand that everyone has a right to his or her own opinion, a movie that some fans will hold up like a piece of gold, will be a chunk of dirt in other film goers eyes &amp; vice versa. THE STEPFATHER 09' just happens to be one of those films. But again, I have trouble seeing why so many people hated it. Now granted, the original is still better, but in my eyes THE STEPFATHER 09' is not to far behind it. It has all the ingredients that makes a thriller of it's kind successful. It has loads of suspense, fantastic acting, great directing, neat plot twists &amp; turns &amp; so much more. The film manages to hold ones interest in it's story as it unravels &amp; is a cut above several, pointless remakes that have been churned out recently, When A Stranger Calls 06'/Black Christmas 06'/The Fog 05' etc. Honestly I think fans were either expecting far to much out of this film, or held onto the original a little to tight. In fact, I actually preferred this one over STEPFATHER 2 &amp; 3 &amp; Walsh does a fantastic job as the Stepfather, filling O' Quinn's shoes quiet nicely &amp; at times even surpassing his performance in many scenes. Highly recommended for those looking for a really good thriller. The ending leaves a set up for a possible sequel, which if it turns out even half as exciting as this film was, will always be welcome.**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is your typical by the numbers horror film. It tells the story of a man who assumes an identity in a new town and tries to woo a family where the woman is either divorced or a widow. He meets a woman who has 2 young children and a son who has been sent off to boarding school. When the son comes back he starts to become weary of the man who could potentially be his step father. Other people start to become weary of him as things don't add up such as not providing his social security number of not having a consistent story. The mother of course does not even pay attention to this until she finds out during a storm that he's really a killer. The film moves along quickly and there are a lot of entertaining moments in this film. The actress that plays the son's bf is just there for sex appeal and does nothing for the story other then someone for the son to talk too about his concerns. The ending was a little disappointing and was not as exciting as it should have been. The twist in the end of the killer getting away and finding a new family was both predictable and unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started out very good. I felt like the stepfather should have died in the end because of all the problems he caused. The beginning caught my eye because I didn't know what was going to happen next. Finally, someone made a movie with a stepfather killer instead of the mom.The kids did a wonderful job acting because they acted just like your typical kid. For an example, when they were playing the video game. They had the volume up loud not knowing there biological was upstairs getting killed by their stepfather. As far as the mother all she wanted was a happy family with a good father just like any other single mother.I like the movie because this could definitely happen in real life. I mean... you have got to know a person's background as far as they're childhood, family, past relationships and more if you plan on marrying that person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately I've been getting annoyed with remakes, the only one so far that had it's moments was Halloween(2007). I thought this one was doomed like Friday the 13th.Susan(Sela Ward)a divorced mother of three, meets David(Dylan Walsh), a handsome nice stranger, and several months later they are engaged. Much to the surprise of the oldest son Michael(Penn Badgely). But David manages to win Michael over. But suspicions begin to raise, when David quits his job, because they asked for an I.D. Michael and Susans friends begin to suspect the man she is in love with is not what he appears to be.Now is Dylan Walsh is just as scary as Terry O. Quinn was from the original film from 1987. Well he comes close, without trying to be carbon copy in his performance. Penn Badgely gives a somewhat descent performance. Amber Heard who plays Michaels girlfriend, is just in it to be eye candy, nothing else. Sela Ward is just alright. Now the only become to clichéd, and there moments that get overly drawn out, even when they don't need to be. It had some moments of good suspense, but it was not as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Theaters: The Stepfather (2009)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin, I must make a confession that I hope will not damage my credibility: I have never seen the 1987 cult classic, "The Stepfather". Therefore, my review of this film, the 2009 remake, is from the viewpoint of a person who had not been formally introduced to this intriguing storyline before. With that out of the way, let's jump right into the here and now. I don't necessarily mind PG-13 horror and, in some ways, I feel that it can be a nice way to introduce viewers to the genre that we all know and love. On the other hand, I have a problem with films that have been edited down from an R-rating to achieve the more marketable PG-13, usually resulting in a lack of cohesion and an overall aura of cheapness. So, I was not as offended by the idea of reviewing this film as most other horror critics were; in fact, I welcomed the opportunity. "The Stepfather" was always designed to be released as a more teen-friendly film and so I was fairly sure that its rating would not hurt it. Was I right...or dead wrong?

		<shortDescription>The original worked, this doesn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very remakey remake, 'The Stepfather' does nothing that the original version didn't do more effectively. It's not a carbon copy; it does go off down its own path often enough to make the odd scene interesting. But it's too long, not very tense, and pretty dull. It begins by muting the impact of the '87 film's memorable opening and ends with a silly wig, and in between it's a blandly slick film lacking the original's impact and economy.Dylan Walsh is all right as the demented stepfather but he's no Terry O'Quinn, and the movie never gets under his skin or makes the most of his desire to create the perfect family and murder them if they let him down. Most of the time he's just a bog standard psycho who goes out of his way to rouse suspicion and makes rookie mistakes like stuffing a body in a communal freezer just under the ready meals. Scares come in the form of stormy nights, jumping cats and poorly-timed hands on the shoulder, so yawn to all that.Two things elevated the movie for me: the performance of Penn Badgley as the son who suspects all is not well - he's believable and pretty much carries the movie; and the lesbian relationship between Paige Turco and Sherry Stringfield, which is allowed to exist without being commented on or used in a lascivious way. This discreet approach is balanced out by director Nelson McCormick's camera spending half its time up Amber Heard's butt, and the measure of the movie's ambition is better gauged there than in any intermittent restraint it might show.</fullReview>

The movie was so predictable not a thriller at all, a waste of time watching it, the ending was not good at all, you see Dylan Walsh start over with a new family a new killing. He should have died in the movie. I personally wouldn't watch it again waste of money to hire.The storyline: Michael returns home from military school to find his mother happily in love and living with her new boyfriend. As the two men get to know each other, he becomes more and more suspicious of the man who is always there with a helpful hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's no wonder still-very-much-alive, Terry O'Quinn both didn't reprise his original Stepfather role, nor make an appearance in this complete waste of space remake, much like the rancid 2006's When a Stranger Calls.All but a shot-by-shot remake, though not close enough to call a 1998's Psycho clone, 2009's The Stepfather begins with the title character, now played by the thoroughly uninteresting and dull Dylan Walsh, getting dressed and stepping over the bodies of his married-into-family he's recently murdered. He vanishes "without a trace" and starts all over with a new family.I'm going to stop there. This scenario might have been plausible in 1987, the year of the original, but hell no in 2009. OK, I'll continue, but be warned, you'll have to suspend your disbelief if you wish to, ha ha, enjoy this needless remake.OK, now the newly named David Harris (performed by Walsh and O'Quinn played him as "Jerry Blake" in the original. And why they changed the name ? much like Nancy (was Thompson/now) Holbrook in the updated A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) ? is beyond me) is with his new family, because, well, he wants the perfect family and he's willing to kill for it.We have the loving but (honestly, justifiably) na?ve mother, Susan (Ward), with children (before it was just one child, I guess they got nervous about writing about just one potential victim child) and one bratty young male on his way home from military school.Dang it, I'm stopping again. Really? Seriously? Military school? Do they even still use that as a cliché in movies when they threaten to send a misbehaving boy away? That's lazy writing. Ugh.Anyways, Michael (Badgley) is suspicious of the new man of the household and (now) rightfully so as Susan's new beau is in over his head with all the cast and characters to "take care of." Any psycho has to keep it simple. Duh, that's why O'Quinn attached onto just a mother and daughter in the original. At very least, David is able to teleport anywhere he wants to, much like Jason Voorhees, as he just appears here/there in a blink of an eye with no rhyme or reason.So?the story continues. Handsome Michael (believe me, you'll see him without a shirt as many times as Taylor Lautner in New Moon/Eclipse) and equally stunning girlfriend, Kelly (Amber Heard, who eerily looked a little too much like a young Scarlett Johansson) who also parades around in a bathing suit possibly thirds of her appearances, begin/stop/start again investigations into David's past.Oh, no. Do they know his secret? Does he know they know? Do they know he knows they know? Does he know they know he knows? Man, this is starting to sound like the old Friends episode ? and even though that was comedy, this was horror, Friends took the cake on that "Who's on First" type-routine. Unfortunately, with all the back and forth and the occasional murder, it's fruitless to care. As does the viewer with the overlong, unbelievable and predictable finale.Little was updated here, but I must say I did like the scenes with the cells and texting, of course, unheard of in the original. That added a very, very small ? star to my rating. Well, that and the final credits scene. Sure, we know what's coming, and that's not what impressed me. It was the freeze frame, old 80s horror homage that was both creepy and a great homage, especially to someone who loved the 80s horror movies/franchises.Wow. If their motives were: I bet you can't find a copy of the 1987 cult-classic, so watch ours. Don't be fooled. You can, in fact, find and appreciate the original. There is ZERO reason to watch this. O'Quinn played it right, he played it scary, he played it real. This movie hinges on the performance of a "new" Stepfather, Walsh and since that fell FLAT as the movie's suspense, and other than googly eying either Badgley or Heard or both, you should SKIP this stepturd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stepfather falls prey to a fatal flaw within the first ten minutes: allowing the audience to know more than the characters. David is clearly not all he seems and his wholesome facade is hiding something much more sinister. The problem is that we know that but his new family has no clue. The foreshadowing is blatantly obvious and the creepy music is so plentiful you could bottle it. Anytime David hides his identity, deletes emails, sneaks around, spies on his family and becomes suspicious of anyone discovering his secret the audience is immediately privy to it. We are witnesses to his murders of two characters in the first half hour and then a third during the final act. The protagonist, Michael, is certain his new stepfather is not who he seems, in spite of what his bonehead girlfriend, oblivious mother and two younger siblings (whose presence is so sparse they might as well not be in the movie) think. He is hellbent on solving this mystery, even though the audience knows everything that he doesn't and all we can do is spend an hour waiting for him to catch up to us. With only one or two marginally suspenseful scenes, a decent performance from Dylan Walsh and enough plot holes to sink a dozen cruise liners, it's best you check your brain at the DVD drive door before watching. Better yet, skip this tepid remake and watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These remakes are annoying and I would never pay to see them. I like horror and figured I would watch it on a subscribed premium channel. This film was an absolute disaster. First off, our villain seems to meet modern , intelligent women. 23 years spaced from the original.... We are led to believe that a woman, with children, no less, will take in a guy and not accept warning signals from friends or not net-search herself the names. If someone makes up a name it is easily , at least basic verifiable to find out if the time they were born is true, where they have lived, even where they went to school or military records, David said he was in military. This was a sham and 23 years ago, would be more believable. The acting was non-existent and Amber Heard, the eye candy of this film , was probably there to keep us from not changing the channel. A horror film that was all too predictable and made our characters, especially Mrs. Harding, look like dimwits. To top off the onslaught of stupidity, this film had an open ending, which was predictable by the way. Now the little respect Hollywood has for us, will probably be another slew of sequels , for a film that was already sequel-ed to death, pardon my choice of words lol, back in the late 80s, early 90s. Watch the original with Terry O'Quinn. It is much more believable and the acting is much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sucked. Most of it was just Micheal(Penn Badgley) and Kelly(Amber Heard) in bathing suits. (Not that I minded seeing Badgley in one.) But this is supposed to be a "Horror" movie. I think the most suspenseful part was the opening scene. I wanted to go to sleep. The scene where Sela Ward is in the bathroom was awful, and none of the actors looked remotely interested in the characters they were playing. The music was Horrible, and the spots that it played in the movie were pointless. I know some movies rely on music for certain scenes, but this movie relied on the soundtrack to make it even the littlest bit creepy. Boring plot, crappy dialogue, all in all, one of the worst "horror" movies I've ever seen. Don't even bother watching it. Go find a better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nip/Tuck's Dylan Walsh stars as a serial killer in The Stepfather, a remake of an 70's or 80's film. Now I have seen a couple of good scary films in 2009. The Stepfather is certainly not one of them. The Stepfather is a cheap excuse for a scary film that doves a little too deep into stupidity. Cause boy is it stupid.Unfortunately, I laughed more than I was scared. There are lot of scary films that unintentionally make you laugh. I laughed out loud with this one. The same thing with The Unborn. Both huge laugh fests and both huge wastes of time.Dylan Walsh plays a serial killer who tries to make it work with a family and if it doesn't he kills them. He starts dating a woman(played by Amber Heard). When her son(played by Penn Badgley) returns from military school and starts to get to know him, he soon suspects that he's a serial killer.The unoriginality in this film is amazing. This is a mixture of The Uninvited, Disturbia, and there is a direct scene from out of Obsessed. Really, the comparison is sick. I watched this film with my sister and she didn't think it's that bad. I thought that it was hilarious. There is only one reason to see this film. Dylan Walsh.Walsh is the only good thing about it. I mean I can't think of anything else good about it. Excluding the fact that it's never boring. Sure it's entertaining. But either way it sucks. Walsh is a good actor. The film is predictable, stupid, funny, and not scary whatsoever. The Stepfather is a movie that must be skipped.The stepfather: 1.5/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a whole lot of build up...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I went into this moving feeling very positive about it, knowing mostly all of the characters because of past movies or roles they have played. The stepfather is rated PG-13, meaning there wasn't going to be any gore, or swearing or nudity. Which is fine, because that doesn't make the movie at all. The story of David (the stepfather) is very unique, and he does do a very good job hiding everything and putting on a good, well amazing show to the family. He always seams to have an answer for any question about himself, but when he refuses to fill out paperwork to get paid for work, questions are raised about who this guy really is. The buildup in this movie is insane, literally I think I sat in the theater waiting for some drastic ending to the families lives for the whole hour and 40 so minutes. Don't get me wrong, the storyline is awesome and the anticipation of David killing the family is almost unbearable. But literally this movie wasn't suspenseful, it wasn't very 'thriller-ish' and definitely not scary. I jumped at one point in the movie when the son and stepfather were on the roof, thats it. I would wait to save the 10 bucks and watch it when it finally is released on TV, and thats only if its a REALLY rainy day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Handsome psychopath, who uses his charm and looks to sucker vulnerable women(most if not all his chosen women were victims of bad marriages which resulted in divorce)leaves the crime scene after the failure of another "perfect family" scenario crumbles. Sela Ward is Susan Harding, recently divorced and instantly drawn to a man named David Harris(Dylan Walsh), a new stranger in town. 6 months later Susan's oldest son, having spent some time in military school for bad behavior, returns, Michael(Penn Badgley)not convinced of David's good intentions(he's too perfect and seems too good to be true)entirely. Sure, at first, David and Michael seem to hit it off, but it doesn't take very long before animosity and tension builds. David's dark side slips out more and more as situations provoke his anger. David's sole desire is to keep his perfect family complete, which means Michael not returning to military school. He gets a job as a real estate agent and hopes he can avoid the authorities out to nab him. As has happened many of times, when fractures appear which could endanger his dream come true, anyone who threatens this will pay with their life. It's not only the structure of the perfect family which David wishes to maintain, but that anyone who could possibly implicate him must be eliminated.Amber Heard in yet another role where she's positively desirable eye candy. I mean every scene she's in draws stares and drool, almost always in a bikini or in a tight shirt and panties. It's clear that Heard will be working in movies for a long time.Another slickly produced, but empty and soulless remake in the vein of PROM NIGHT(also written by JS Cardone). Michael is the screenplay's Jill Schoelen, he is the one who ultimately uncovers the true identity of the film's killer. The thing is that if you have watched the first two THE STEPFATHER films, then you know that in this remake positively nothing new is presented that wasn't covered in those movies. Jay(Jon Tenney), the father, is an intruder who could spoil everything David has tried hard to build for himself.In the screenplay, there are numerous characters who are interested in David's past(Carolyn Williams was this kind of snoop in THE STEPFATHER II)and each is to be targeted. While most of them are right in their suspicions, such as Jackie(Paige Turco), his real estate employer who desires documents needed to secure his identity, before they can inform Susan he strikes. JS Cardone includes the groan-inducing cliché of David leaving as Michael goes through his things, returning after Susan calls to tell him she'll pick up the kids for their dentist appointment. And, the "I don't want to see you go back to that school again" scene where David warns Michael of his sneaking around..all I could do was roll my eyes in discontent. Included from the original, David shaves and cleans himself up after slaughtering his family, he's a carpenter, and carries around a doctor's bag with his true initials.Destined for Lifetime Movie Channel, the violence that is in the film is tame, such as a victim thrown down a flight of basement steps and a pool drowning. That said, Walsh does well at slipping in and out of serial killer mode, like putting on and taking off a mask. He shows that his killer has been doing this for quite some time. My two favorite scenes include his slamming a staked sign, when clients for the home show up his face, full of rage, twists into a happy smile &amp; he's at the dinner table momentarily visualizing a past family he once had, now replaced by the current one he's liable to destroy if things don't work out. The ending is preposterous, asking us to believe that someone could be stabbed in the neck with a piece of broken mirror and continue to live as if it were merely a scratch.</fullReview>

There were constant jump scenes which anybody listening should have expected by the overuse of suspense background music, and when it wasn't that, the movie was set to crappy emo music. Other than the Stepfather, you'd think one of the characters would have had the sense for what to do with a phone.If you're one for eye candy, you'll love the son's girlfriend who, aside from at the beginning of the movie, apparently seems to live her entire life wearing only underwear or bikinis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this kind of story so many times, that I actually held hope this one would offer a twist of some kind, or at least attempt to freshen up the genre. Unfortunately, The Stepfather relies on old tricks. The basic formula for a "creepy person becomes part of the family" is that one character knows something is up with the stranger but nobody around believes him or her. This plot device of having every other character be incredibly stupid tends to become annoying to the audience even when it is well executed. Here, it is not well executed at all and so, the film becomes as pleasant as driving a nail through one's kneecap. The creepy stranger here is David Harris, whose M.O. seems to be to seduce single mothers, get in the family's lives until he's "disappointed" and then kill everyone. Dylan Walsh plays this psycho. It's a dream for many actors to get such parts because they are fun and usually flattering for actors. Unfortunately, I didn't think Walsh was particularly great, nor did the direction or writing flattered him much. When in seduction mode, the psycho is charming, in a "bland suburban dude" way. When there's absolutely no edge to his meaner side. The guy is just not scary. So how does the director go about scaring us? Entirely through "jump scare" scenes. This is, in my opinion, what makes this movie falls completely flat compared to other entries in the genre such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" or "Disturbia", both of which rely on amazing acting, a few scare scenes but also psychological suspense. Here, we are presented with a bland family that seems to disintegrate but the director isn't able to involve us and draw us in this world. What you're left with is an incredibly boring movie, which the director attempts to save by having Amber Heard pointlessly parade in front of us in bikini at random intervals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable and boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a boring and dull movie, nothing about it was either scary or intense. The plot is about this guy named David Harris played by Dylan Walsh who actually did a good job with what he was given, that goes around trying to make the best family by weaseling his way into being a stepfather, but when his attempt to make the perfect family fails. He kills the whole family and rinse and repeat. So the film shows what he does with the Harding family, and although I haven't seen the 3 originals this one was just too predictable and boring. Most of the scenes where the stepfather snaps is shown in the trailers. Amber Heard is hot, but the director seemed to depend on her to sell the movie cause it just wouldn't stop showing her assets. Not that I am complaining or anything, but it just proves how this film could have been a straight to DVD. This is another cheap attempt for the movie industry to make a few bucks off of the younger generation. If you have time to kill, just watch it on your television. The trailer was misleading as well, since it took out the best scene from the trailer in the final cut.3.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daddy's on America's Most Wanted for murdering his last family... but he's so cute!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, what can I say? I knew that I was potentially watching a bad movie, but in some way I had a little hope for the film when I began watching it. I haven't even seen the original, to be honest, I didn't even know this was a remake. Weird, I've seen a ton of movies, but never heard of this one. Anyways, I always look for a fun little horror movie, but The Stepfather fails as we enter in typical clichés once again with the jump scare, clichéd characters and a very unscary villain. I always love how the main character suspects something about our obvious villain and somehow everyone doesn't seem to agree with him that something isn't right. Now this villain is everything you could imagine that people would question who he really is, but when he gives the most BS answer, they just accept it. He's barely part of the main family for 6 months, he looses his temper by grabbing his fiancée's son by the neck and she doesn't believe her son?! How can I like these characters? This story is just stupid.Michael Harding returns home from military school to find his mother Susan happily in love with a man known as David Harris. He seems like the perfect father and husband to everyone; except Michael, who suspects that he isn't quite the man he seems to be. Along with his girlfriend Kelly, his father Jay, and Susan's friends, they slowly start to piece together the mystery of the man who is set to become his stepfather, but they may be too late in getting to the truth. As people who realize the inadequacies of David's story start to mysteriously die or disappear systematically, Michael is convinced his soon-to-be stepfather is behind them. After finding his father's body in the basement, Michael sets out to save his family and girlfriend before they become David's latest victims.Like I said, with the stupid story and unlikable characters come into play, this movie just didn't work. I think it could have had better potential, but it was just too lazy. Hoping the audience is going to just accept that this guy could just waltz into this family without them questioning anything is just crazy. If I were the mom, I would have asked him about his family and when I was going to meet them, after all wouldn't you be curious about your guy's background? Also gotta love that the son who starts to question the guy, his loving and trusting girlfriend just doesn't believe a word he says, I think the dad had to have his hands around her throat before she finally started to think that something wasn't right with him. The lame jump scares also needed to stop with this movie, I hate this stupid cliché. It's like a cheap cop out with the audience and anyone who considers this scary needs to start watching real horror films to see what real suspense truly is. This was just a stupid lame movie that wasted my time. I had hope for it and everything about it just turned into a bad excuse for a horror film.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair update, Terry O'Quinn still the best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am a big fan of the original 1987 version, I knew the whole story so there were no surprises. The modern updating of the story ie. cell phones, cell phone cameras, the internet, Americas Most Wanted, and the lesbian sister story line were all fine. Trading Jill Schoelen for Penn Badgley was acceptable because the also added Amber Heard. By the way Amber Heards best scene so far this year was the bathroom scene from "Zombieland"; very funny, great tongue action. I really hoped for more with the introduction of more children but that part fell a little short. And Sela Ward looks fabulous, she had some good scenes, but just like the "The Fugitive" she was under utilized. I know Dylan Walsh has done a lot of other things, most notable is "Nip/Tuck" on FX, but I can only remember seeing him in "Congo". Here he did a fine job, but he had big shoes to fill following Terry O'Quinns performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film! Definitely underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally I was a little skeptical before seeing this film based on the reviews, but man was I wrong. It actually ended up being a very good film with a surprisingly fitting ending. The acting was very good, the digital effects were good, the action sequences were great, and the overall storyline got me hooked. Like others, I definitely was reminded of Disturbia while watching this film. Most story elements seemed to be taken from Disturbia, which is why I gave it a lower rating than I sounded like I would have given it.Overall this was a very good film! I definitely recommend seeing it if you like horror/action films. Nice job with this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gossip Girl's Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) plays Michael Harding in this new movie the Step Father. After being sent away to somewhat of a military camp for six months Michael returns back home with his girlfriend Kelly Porter (Amber Heard). Only to see with his dismay that his Mom Susan Harding (Sela Ward) is engaged to a guy he doesn't even know. How would you react in this situation if a person you've never met is a part of your family? His new step Dad David Harris (Dylan Walsh) says family is the most important thing to him. Michael plays it cool and gives David a chance. Then after the neighbor tells Susan how resembles a sketch of a man on America's Most Wanted, popping out of nowhere all the time, and bad comments about a mom killing her kids on the news Michael starts to wonder. This movie was yet thrilling and scary and kept you wanting to know what was going to happen next. It was kind of slow, but fun to watch. Penn Badgley did a great job in his role in this movie and he is growing to be a good actor on Gossip Girl. Amber Heard which i saw recently on Never Back Down and Pineapple Express played her girlfriend role to Badgley and did a great job showing her true colors. Interested to see what these young actors will take on next in their acting career. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.</fullReview>
