		<shortDescription>Atmospheric ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best Asian horror remakeI was fortunate enough to view the film during the Cannes Film Festival. And it was received by the critics and audiences with open arms. The original film, "Sigaw", was the first Filipino horror for a long time to be very atmospheric.Directed by the original film's director, Yam Laranas, "The Echo" is a very fine and atmospheric film like the original. The changes from the original was obvious and was probably done to expand the character histories.Delivering very frightening chills, "The Echo" is a step up to your average Asian horror remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ECHO is the Hollywood remake of the Filipino horror movie from director Yam Laranas entitled "Sigaw" which is also released in the international market with the similar title "The Echo" The story begins when a young ex-con comes home to the apartment where her mother who passed away, lived. He curiously tries to find out what happened to her and why she died. He discovers that the apartment he lives in is having strange occurrences. He finds drops of blood, hears noises of things that are not there, and at the same time, he is also concerned about his apartment neighbor; a mother and daughter who is being victimized by an abusive live-in partner. All these things that haunt him soon affect his life, his work, and his relationship. He even begins to question his own sanity. Soon enough, he must face these things so that it will bring him peace.Supposedly one that should be categorized as something which is more of a Ghost Story and Psychological Drama, THE ECHO is rich in stylistic visual images. An artful blend of bleak beauty in terms of cinematography and atmosphere, with the eerie vibe created by its storyline. The moments of horror may not be too bloody (except perhaps for one scene that had me biting my own finger) but they indeed transmit the sense of gloom well into its audience.Jesse Bradford obviously did a better performance than Richard Guttierez (in the original version). His fear and sense of paranoia can communicate well with the audience. Iza Calzado is as haunting as she was in the original. I actually felt that the movie needed more focus on Iza whose role in the original was underlined well, and was very relevant with real world issues of abuse.The Echo takes a lot of time to build up the horror. The slow build-up is reminiscent of old horror movies like The Exorcist, which takes its time to make its characters whole and establish a familiarity with the audience before it spills out the full extent of the horror.The minor problem with The Echo is that if you have already watched the original Echo movie which is known here in the Philippines as "Sigaw" and you already have an idea what these hauntings are all about and why they occur, you might feel that it tends to drag and bore, because the surprise is already spoiled for you. Much of the movie's appeal relies on not knowing why these things happen.As much as my heart goes out to the director, though, I am sorry to say that I felt that the build-up just dragged too slowly. Some sequences felt like it was just an exercise of waiting for something to happen. I feel that this needed to be re-cut, just to delete off the sequences that are horribly unnecessary. The subplots in between the horror sequences sometimes feel uninteresting. There is a good pay-off at the end but its pay-off is not as satisfying as, say, The Exorcists' final act which all goes off to hellish chaos. Instead, its pay-off is still storyline-based. It does not go off in a whimper, no, it does unleash some hell. But not enough to get it off its track, as it maintains its disciplined pace, leading to an appropriate end which makes the story go full circle. You will soon realize that this is NOT the Exorcist; this is a Ghost Story.If you watch this movie, do not expect this to be like your run-of-the-mill slasher flick or torture horror; you should just expect a good ghost movie. There is some violence and gore in it, but this is no monsterfest. It is never goofy and it treats its own story in a very serious manner. It feels like something that may have happened in reality. That is actually its beauty because many other horror movies out there tend to overblow their stories to a point that it feels bogus and cartoonish. The Echo takes its time and is more or less grounded in reality. Quiet, but eerie. Just like the ghosts that live around us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Genuine Creepiness In This One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Echo had a handful of scenes with an uncomfortable creepiness akin to classic J-Horror. Rarely do I reach for the remote anymore having experienced most every range of horror film out there, but this one seeped under my skin and had me on edge more than twice. And it is that sort of unsettling moodiness combined with frights you hafta' be paying attention to catch. You know, the kind where after they've come and gone you must back em up for a second take. Truly those "WTF" type instances.Jesse Bradford plays Bobby, a twenty something recently released from prison after doing a stint for killing a guy who attempted to rape his HOT girlfriend (played by Ameiia Warner) in a restroom. Having nowhere else to go, he heads back to the ol' East Village NYC neighborhood. Mom has died a spooky death from starvation, he learns, when he moves in to her old apartment. There's bloody fingernails on the piano keys and rumbles in the walls and a mean-looking cop next door who enjoys beating his wife and little girl. Bobby starts to see things, though, and these things aren't making any sense and they're a bit ghastly to boot. It's when Bobby decides he can no longer put up with the abuse he is overhearing next door and reports it to the cops, only to have them respond to a completely vacant apartment next door, that things go from odd to friggin' strange.Bobby's apartment reminded me a lot of the apartment in the game Silent Hill 4: The Room with its eerily watered down dingy browns and rusts. There are holes in the peeling plaster walls and everything gives off the mood of worn and filthy. It's a truly lonely place that flattened my spirits each time Bobby returned home.The Echo is not without its disappointments and inconsistencies which converge on a far too abrupt ending that leaves the viewer feeling a bit jipped. Oh well, though. It is a decently freaky ride getting there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comes Alive Only in the Second Half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I heard about it, I wanted to watch this American production of a Filipino horror film, with the same director (Yam Laranas) at the helm. However, when I heard it went straight to DVD instead of wide theatrical release, I knew I had to temper my expectations.The first half of this movie moves at a literal snail's pace. There was nothing much to establish, yet it certainly took its time. Bobby Reynolds (Jesse Bradford) earns parole from his prison term and went to live in his mother's apartment, which had been abandoned since her recent death. However, he sees strange things and hears strange sounds while he is there. This entire scenario with the Mom was not in the Philippine version at all, yet so much time was spent on this side story here.However, in the second half, the movie finally comes alive when the story about the family who lived next door to Bobby finally gets dealt with in more of its gruesome detail. These scary scenes were shot very well, with the right amount of nervous tension. Still we see the victims do what most "horror movie victims" stupidly do to deserve their fates. The ending would seem to be quite simplistic given the extensive build-up to that point. This is especially true for us who had already seen the original before.Jesse Bradford did well to convey how a macho ex-con could be the central character of a horror film, which is not typical. He did much better than the original actor. I felt it was too bad that Iza Calzado, who was given the chance to reenact her original role in this American version, was given little opportunity to fully delve into her disturbed character of the abused wife. Some time could have been spent to describe her situation more, than the excessive time given Jesse to explore his apartment. Knowing her character more could have increased the audience's satisfaction with the story's final outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She Just Needed Someone to Help Her</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bobby Reynolds (Jesse Bradford) is released on probation from Rikers and moves to the old apartment in East Village, New York, where his lonely mother lived and passed away. He finds a job as mechanic in the Houston Auto Repair owned by the supportive Hector Rodriguez (Carlos Leon) and tries to rebuild his life. However, he is outcast and his former friends and neighbors do not want to talk to him. He meets his former girlfriend Alyssa Foldes (Amelia Warner) that works as waitress and studies in a college of design. Bobby hears weird noises and finds blood in his apartment, and overhears an argument between an abusive police officer and his wife and their daughters. Sooner he discovers that the next door apartment is actually empty and he is haunted by the ghosts of the deceased family that was not helped by the neighbors. "The Echo" is a good ghost story and apparently a remake of a horror movie from Philippines that I have not the chance to see yet. The plot is supported by a stylish cinematography and a creepy apartment building that gives a scary atmosphere. The conclusion does not explain how Bobby could justify the death of Hector in the basement of his building in the same day of his absence to the probation officer and even the bruises in Alyssa and if the curse has ended. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Ecos do Mal" ("Echoes from the Evil")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it over?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bobby (Jesse Bradford), an ex-convict who served time for involuntary manslaughter, is released from prison and attempts to reclaim his life. Cut off by former friends and relatives the only person willing to reignite their acquaintance is Alyssa (Amelia Warner), Bobby's former girlfriend and reason for indictment. Bobby moves into his mother's apartment, who died when he was locked away. However almost immediately afterwards strange occurrences and noises bring Bobby to verge of insanity...Is is over yet? The craze of repackaging all the more-or-less decent Asian movies into American crap-fest seems to have passed its expiration date and hopefully "The Echo" is the last we have heard of this. "The Ring" and "The Eye" were passable, because of the novelty, but this time around the predictable range of frights and scares and weird moving Asian chicks does not make for a compelling watch, but for a tiresome pass-time.The script also begs for improvement, as it basically barely balances its credibility on a ghost family, which aims to hand out vengeance on all those who decided to turn a blind eye in times of need. This basically extends itself to anyone who haphazardly stumbles onto the floor. Naturally the ghosts enter into a killing spree when Bobby happens to move in, despite the events having taken place several years back and having nothing whatsoever to do with our chance hero.And by the way - what is it with the crackpot old lady riding up and down the elevator? It has no meaning to the story whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if you refused to help a person in need?and paid for it in a more horrible way than you can comprehend?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~As will be reviewed in the June 2010 issue of Twisted Dreams Magazine - Contains spoilers!~ Have you ever seen someone in need and offered to help? Or are you one of those people who passes people by and thinks, someone else will do it ? don't get involved? What if your lack of involvement caused devastating circumstances to the victim? What if because of your refusal to help, they sought vengeance against you? Meet Bobby. Newly out of jail (and I later found out that it was not his fault and was reminded of how badly the American "justice" system sucks. But you'll have to watch to find out why he was jailed!) and just wanting to start over again. He tries to pick up the pieces of what was once his life and moves into his deceased mother's apartment. And that's when the trouble starts.It begins with noises, odd and troubling sounds that wake him up and then the visions of his dead mother begin to play havoc with his mind and he is slowly sucked into a never-ending nightmare.His neighbor, Gina (Calzado) is an abused wife whose husband, Walter (played with far too chilling realism by Durand) likes to come home and smack around on both her and their daughter, Carly.Bobby may have been in prison, but he still won't stand for his neighbor ? cop or not ? to beat on his wife and kid and tries to help?but things just start getting stranger.The visions begin to happen more and more frequently and it's not just Bobby who finds himself thrust into the middle of something he doesn't understand. The visions also begin to manifest themselves to Alyssa (Warner) and to other tenants of the building.However?the more Bobby tries to help, the more dangerous Walter becomes with devastating consequences to Gina and Carly.But things are not as they seem and as Bobby slowly loses his sanity (or so he feels) he finds out the real reason why he's being tormented and what he has to do to stop it.This is a great Noir movie, simply seething with dark tension and chills. I sat on my couch, anxiously anticipating each scene and was so involved that my husband looked at me and said, "Holding hands with yourself, dear?" I looked down and my hands were clamped so tightly together I was cutting off circulation.Dark, tragic and with a stellar performance by Kevin Durand as the wife-beating cop that will leave you hating him, but feeling solemn compassion for him as well, culminate to a head in the explosive ending and you'll never quite look at cops?or apartment buildings the same, ever again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go ahead, it's worth it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it ridiculous that this movie didn't get a good release while the likes of Boogeyman, They, The Unborn, and countless other Asian film remakes did! This movie is worth your time, to say the least.I won't really say it's slow paced as things started the moment the lead character got in the apartment. But it definitely is boring if your concept of a horror movie is limited to gore and run-for-your-life scenes after every 5 minutes of dialogue. This is more of an "alone at night horror movie" than an "invite friends over and have popcorn" type. The enjoyment lies in the appreciation of story, texture, and creepy atmosphere of the film, which the director served in good proportions.I liked how Yam Laranas outdid himself in the remake. The story is tighter, and the American lead actors were better than their Filipino counterparts...though I can't say the same for the supporting characters.In closing, let me just debunk a review here which commented on the other users' comments instead of commenting on the movie (and I'm committing the same crime now), but The Echo is at the very least a decent ghost movie...to call it "half-decent" is already being silly. The film is No Exorcist, but to discredit it just to balance out the opinion of those who thought it was good is self-deception.The movie is not without its imperfections, but it won't make you cry for your 90 minutes. Many contemporary horror movies did worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So ghosts are morons who kill indiscriminately... What else is new.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What was that ending all about? You wait and wait for something to finally happen, something that will make half-way any sense, something that will connect the rather flimsy-looking dots into something at least resembling logic but then... So the cop's wife is the killer? Did she beat the child? If so, who wounded her own arms? Herself? Did she and her cop husband both beat the girl? (Perhaps the director and the scriptwriter joined them in the beating...) Did the cop and his wife both beat on the girl, and then each other - and then themselves? (I gotta keep my mind open for all possible ludicrous combinations when it comes to TE.) Why would the ghosts of the mother and the daughter kill all those people? Once again ghosts are just some violent, confused imbeciles who go around killing the wrong people. One would presume that ghosts, having nothing better to do all day than sit/stand around hallways staring into empty space, would have ample time to figure things out, i.e. who their friends and foes are. But no... Average horror-film's ghost's IQ: 15 point 3.The ghosts display the ability to haunt outside their natural habitat by hassling Bobby's girlfriend, played by the beautiful Amelia Warner. So why didn't they use those abilities to get revenge on the old man who lives across the street, who failed to call for help when he saw that something was happening? Not much makes sense in this slow-moving, garbled ghost flick.Bobby's girlfriend arrives to his flat TWICE unannounced. What kind of people visit others without calling them first? Was this the pre-mobile-phone 18th century age? His boss does this also, once. How very convenient. What a nice little plot-device.No-one tells anybody anything, every conversation is about trivialities which, again, conveniently creates opportunities for the dimwitted ghosts to take advantage of various situations, over and over. And here I thought it was Bergman's asinine dramas that revolved around a lack of communication...</fullReview>

I did have problems with the lead character, who reacted in a daze to people around him, failing to answer their questions or trying to figure out his latest hallucination. Irritating.Biggest problem is the pace. It only kicks off at the hour mark, and the victims seem a bit random. Also, although the revenge is turned around in the end, it wasn't the husband who should have been revenging in the first place, should it? The opening audio is good, and when the starvation idea came on I thought we were off to a weird ride. But it turned into a simple ghost story.

And it has very good and interesting story which many great movies lack.Its the story about love , affection , violence, and somewhat cute and romantic.I had watched it in 2008 on HBO at midnight. Great time to see these kind of movies. I wasn't disappointed at all by the movie.. the story is awesome and everything else is OK. i had forgot the name of movie , and recently I was searching for it and couldn't find it .I tried a lot describing plot and asking on yahoo answers but it seemed not many people had seen it. i even tried on IMDb by categorizing by horror and sorting through a large number of movies , but could't find again due to its poor rating (??). Then one day I goggled " horror + violence +apartment + neighbor + prison " as these were the words describing the plot , and Bingo ,I found the movie. hope to see it one more time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film as a horror/thriller did it's job pretty well for me and the girlfriend. There was a pretty effective creepy atmosphere throughout and a few decent jumpy parts. The acting and script on a whole are good, not amazing but enough to keep you interested.The thing that really made this mediocre was the ending, seemed to me like the writers just kinda gave up or something as it doesn't wrap up the story at all. Also the ghosts just seem to randomly attack people who have nothing to do with their past just cause they're p***ed off or something...A decent horror flick to watch in the dark, definitely worth the watch for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Echos From The Wall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the Phillipino flick, 'Sigaw', 'The Echo' follows the traditional path of the typical European/Asian claustrophobic chiller flick. The story is simplistic, predictable and weak. Some of the subplots are uninteresting and don't really fit with the main story. It starts off slow and the tense atmosphere is very well maintained. This is no slasher flick. It's mostly atmospheric and that's where it succeeds. The creepy and claustrophobic interiors of Bobby's building and the stylistic execution, first rate cinematography and sound effects contribute very well in creating tension. While the lead character Bobby is well developed, I felt that the other characters suffered from poor writing. Jesse Bradford is excellent and he confidently carries the movie displaying depth and restraint. Iza Calzado is very good despite the way her role was written.As flawed as it is, it's not a bad suggestion for a one-time watch especially for those who enjoy films of this kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sexist ending ruined it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There isn't much to say about the film except for this. IT HAD A SHITTY ENDING. It was a brilliant film until THAT happened. What do I mean by "THAT". I'll tell you. In the film, an ex-con moves into his dead mum's flat and hears acts of violence in the (vacant) flat next door. Reason I put in vacant in brackets because there was a family who lived in there before they died. They died because no one came to the rescue when the husband killed his wife and daughter and then committed suicide. So at the end, the ex-con watches the act in play and decides to do what nobody had done beforehand...intervene. Good on the ex- con, by rights that should have stopped the whole thing. But it wasn't as the wife takes the husbands baton and BEATS HIM WITH IT!!!! It was complete SEXIST. Normally i can handle dead women killing blokes, but THAT COW WAS HAD NO RIGHT TO DO WHAT SHE DONE! To add insult to injury, once she kills her husband, she and her daughter went to heaven. PURE RUBBISH!!!! People who thought "Well done girl" or "he had it coming" need their heads fixed.3/10 SHOULD'VE HAD A BETTER ENDING INSTEAD OF THE SEXIST PILE OF CRAP</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very definition of 'slow burner'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, a 'slow burner' denotes something that takes a while to get going. Sadly, 'The Echo' goes so slowly through most of the film, that you're probably asleep by the time the last act (and by 'last act' I mean 'last few minutes') comes along (either that or turned it off).The film follows a man recently released from prison, who returns home to find all sorts of spooky goings on in his apartment. The film start predominantly with him wandering from room to room, trying to work out where various noises are coming from. It is nicely shot, which does give it a suitable creepy atmosphere and, every now and again, there is the odd eerie scene.However, it's all too little and not often enough. Whatever spookiness is too sparse to really be bothered about. The ending isn't bad. There's the obligatory 'twist' (or should I say 'explanation'?) regarding what's going on, but, by the time it happens, will you care?http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Echo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bobby(Jesse Bradford; SWIMFAN) is an ex-con trying to get on with his life after prison, lands a job as a mechanic, returns to the apartment where his mom starved herself to death. Bobby is hearing sounds from the room next to his apartment, a cop abusing his wife, their traumatized daughter out in the hall. A tenant who lives down the hall also experiences sounds and visions that aren't there. Bobby's ex-girlfriend, Alyssa(Amelia Warner; QUILLS), studying to be a fashion designer, reluctant to start a new relationship with him even though she is responsible, in a sense, for his being sent to prison. Life for Bobby goes south fast. He calls the police on a domestic dispute learning that no one lives in that apartment where all that anger and destruction permeate loudly, the echo causing mental mayhem. The tenant down the hall, Joseph Wright(character actor Pruitt Taylor Vince) dies of fright thanks in part to the ghouls which haunt the floor. Bobby is put on suspension when a car is stolen, because he's the only one with a record(Rikers leaves you with a reputation you do not need hanging over you like a thundercloud). He misses an evaluation with his parole officer. Alyssa is experiencing the same hallucinations that Joseph Wright was and Bobby is undergoing.Like THE GRUDGE, a curse spawned from a past incident pollutes whoever comes in contact with it in THE ECHO. What lives on that floor leaves it's imprint on those that have the misfortune of remaining on it too long. THE ECHO is very similar in ways to THE GRUDGE. The victims' apparitions haunt Bobby, Mr. Wright, Bobby's boss(Carlos Leon), and Alyssa because each one sees, hears, and experiences their presence. Spiritual unrest manifests itself and this torments and terrorizes those the ghosts chooses. THE ECHO really is not much different than what the Asian ghost genre has been putting out for 12 years now. There's a reason behind the aforementioned unrest and the protagonist of the movie will have to find out why and how to solve the puzzle so he(or in many instances she)can have peace. In THE ECHO, the incident could've been prevented if someone had offered to help the mother and daughter, instead turning a deaf hear which resulted in tragedy. THE ECHO is pretty average fright fare, the usual musical cues telling the viewer to jump, some hideous make-up distorting the faces of the victims' ghosts. The ghosts pop up from behind or appear at various intervels to spook certain characters. To be honest, THE ECHO contributes very little to the American machine of remakes based on Asian horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie, sometimes confusing thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Connecticut native Jesse Bradford plays a quiet ex-con who moves into his dead mother's East Village apartment. A cop and his wife and young daughter live next door, and the ex-con often hears fighting going on in their apartment. He also begins hearing odd noises, which the landlord attributes to old pipes. He then begins seeing apparitions, which may or may not be his dreams. He discovers that his mother died of starvation, and a tape recording she left behind reveals she too was disturbed by odd noises and visions. When he finally calls the cops on the abusive neighbor, all hell breaks loose, starting with the fact that the apartment next door is vacant, and has been for quite some time. This is a English-language remake of a foreign-made 2004 thriller, made by the same director. It's definitely one of those vengeful spirit movies Asians apparently love so much. Bradford appears in just about every scene, and does a nice job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake improves a little bit on the original and is far more better filmed and managed to be creepier. I thought the performances were pretty good and modest but nothing that packs a punch and if you seen the original you pretty much know what's going to happen and what is going to be the outcome in the end so they pretty much didn't add anything new or major to the story. I never thought anything about it was all that scary or terrifying just creepy, chilling and atmospheric and when all is said and done it's just another American horror remake but one of the more decent ones and one of the slickest ones out there but nothing groundbreaking. Overall if you are still not sick of Asian supernatural/horror like movies that's low on gore and high on chills and atmosphere and if you enjoyed the film 100 feet here you go, just don't expect anything new or unique.

It is far too generic to be a cult hit, seen this type of film a million times (think 'Grudge' or 'The Ring' or any other east Asian remake), it is not even slightly like 'The Exorcist' (the build up really isn't that slow) and why the comparison is made I'll never know, as for realistic - gimmie a break, it's realistic if you live in 'spooky Asian ghost land', and last time I checked that place wasn't real.So, in a nutshell what we have is a half decent ghost story that we've all seen before. If you've seen any of the other East Asia movie remakes then you know what to expect. In fact the 'scary' parts are identical in all the remakes - pale Asian lady and/or child pulling scary faces and moving about a bit strange. I find it strange that when Hollywood remakes an Asian film they transplant China or were ever the original was made for the USA (Grudge being an exception), make all the characters Caucasian, but leave the scary people as Asians! Were the scary people in the Asian version Caucasian? No, so why not transplant the whole thing, I mean it's almost racist, and Asian women walking weird aren't scary!Anyway, rant over, overall it's OK as a rental, but nothing to shout about.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what people are talking here on IMDb. It's the same movie we are watching? Are they smoking something, are they f@@king whit chemicals? Only crack can make you jump like they say in the reviews - so half the people on IMDb are smoking crack?Scary, creepy, atmospheric, slow burner ghost story...WOW! Let the pipe down for a minute!Believe me people this is a BIG P.O.S! Don't waste your money on this! It's nothing creepy or scary, only if you are 11 and hyper sensitive and of course if you abuse the pipe you'll find this scary.This is nothing new, we already seen this done better, i don't know what i was expecting, but reading the reviews here i thought maybe this is good. I was dead wrong.I keep saying, never believe the positive reviews on IMDb, it's sad because you need an opinion from outside to decide if you'll spend the money or not. We need the truth! This site it's going down with kids all over the place and drug abuse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I had no idea when I watched this, that it is a Remake of a movie called "Sigaw" (not to be confused at all with Jigsaw). Unfortunately I haven't seen the Original that is why I am judging this solely without any input from the Original. Maybe I would've only given it 5/10, if I had seen the Spanish language version that came before it, maybe I would've thought it improved it, as another reviewer did right here on IMDb on the comments section.But back to this, that has some nice acting and some really good looking people involved in the main roles. Don't let that distract you from the plot though. On the other hand, the beginning (audio) is so eerie, the movie that is following could never fully live up to that (on the horror scale that is). Still even with phoned in performances by Kevin Durand (gotta admire his physical presence) this still has a few things going for it. So the main character acts weird and doesn't really do or ask the things he should. But we're almost used to that in horror movies nowadays. The tension filled story almost completely makes up for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Asian Horror Remakes and no ending in sight (I pray its around the corner)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that at first I was captured by Echo. The atmosphere created is great, the building that the plot is set in is pretty creepy, the actors do a great job and the back story of the main character coming out of jail also gave it a different and dramatic edge. After looking at the trailer for the original movie Sigaw it seemed thy remade it pretty equal story-wise and just put it in a New York Setting.So here is my problem... why the hell do we need remakes of these movies? If the original movie is good, watch it. I didn't even know that this was a remake when watching it but the clues are left and right. Its just the same thing as Ring, Ju-On, Dark Water and the likes. The basic plot is about something bad that happened in the past and haunts a building and its new inhabitants. We've seen it... the ghosts are female again with the difference that they don't really go for a ghost look here but for a more realistic zombie-kind look. The main character is portrayed really well, there is some nice scares but the more the story unfolds the more you are let down by a plot that just makes no sense to me. The end is a joke with no resolution whatsoever. Funny thing is that its a clichéd happy end with ghosts finding their peace but topped of with a rather bleak outlook for our main character. I hate happy endings but here i found it damn misplaced.Many things seem random... the fingernails in the piano, the whole piano melody thing, the hole in the wall, the people around the main character dying off like flies just because they knocked at his door once (Why hector has to die makes no sense unless you aim for the bleak ending and don't care for logic). We never learn why the ghosts can harm people by beating them up really bad and we never learn why its the good ones that get killed by the "good ghosts" (yeah, there is a bad one in there too!). Too many things are just thrown in there but most of it doesn't come together as a coherent story in the end.So if you take the mysterious unfolding of Ring, the haunted apartment story of Ju-On, the rather down to earth story behind the ghosts from Dark Water and put it all in a blender with a hundred ideas from other similar movies you get the mash that Echo is.Sure, its atmospheric but if you do a remake of a movie it needs to have a solid story and Echo simply doesn't. The writing is just bad. So the really good casting and acting as well as choice of setting is just plain wasted because some idiot studio went for another Asian remake because everybody does it nowadays.I never understood why they remade a mediocre Asia movie like "one missed call" and I don't get this one either. Stop wasting money on this rubbish and invest it into good local screenwriters scripts who surely come up with fresher and more coherent plots than these.Someone needs to start a petition to stop remakes of any kind, its gotten out of hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done but already done...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Echo is a classic ghost story. After being released from prison, Bobby moves in his deceased mother's apartment, in an old building and from there, strange things are felt and heard. The sets are great, the old building is perfect for this story. Jesse Bradford is adequate as the protagonist, a sort of well-meaning bad boy who got on the wrong track through no fault of his. There are lots of pieces to the puzzle, lots of people he interacts with... but nothing really grabs you. It's not that the things are necessarily flawed. The story is just following a conventional track that many fans of the genre have already seen, and it's been done better.There are no memorable scenes whatsoever in this film but you will probably not regret seeing it once if you like slow moving supernatural movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one stays with you!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Montreal screening was a testament of how good this movie is. OMG! This is really really scary. Slow in some parts but it totally brings the mood. The scares will stay with you even after you've left the cinema. Jesse Bradford showed some real acting chops and his character is so believable. The Echo is not your usual shrieks and screams. In fact the movie is very quiet. That is why it is so effective - you don't know when the scares will happen. The realistic treatment of domestic violence added to the horror of the story. If you like Rosemary's Baby or The Sixth Sense, then this is the perfect film for you. The movie is above par compared to most SCARY movies out there and I would say that this will be a cult hit. It's so sad that it's not picked up yet by North American distributors. Too bad for my friends in the west coast! I hope this gets released soon. The director is someone to watch out for. Tr?s bon !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only give this movie a 9 because it was a bit slow to get started. A young man gets out of jail and moves into his mothers old apartment. No one is quite sure how she died and the door had to be broken in for her body to be taken out. He makes some discoveries in the apartment that leave him with a lot of questions. One day as he's going to his apartment, he ends up in an elevator with a police officer. He doesn't say anything, but you can sense is discomfort as he feels like the officer is following him. He proceeds to his apartment and the officer enters the apartment next door. He begins to hear arguments in the adjoining apartment and bangs on the wall at one point to let them know he hears them. Occasionally he sees their little girl sitting in the hall playing a tiny play piano. Each day seems to pull him more and more into the events of this family. When we find out why the guy went to jail, we understand why he is reluctant to risk a possible fight with the man. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll end here. This movie should make us reflect on whether or not it is our business to step in when we see someone getting abuse. Like the woman that was raped and killed outside a building while no one did a thing to stop it, or the current gang rape that just happened. Ask yourself if you would put yourself at risk for someone you don't know and whether you would expect someone to step in if you were in some kind of danger at the hands of another person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very entertaining supernatural thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this creepy thriller, a recently released convict moves into his dead mothers apartment &amp; is soon plagued by creepy voices &amp; ghostly images that seemingly want to tell him something &amp; as he digs further into the mystery of his mother's death, he discovers some shocking truths about the neighbours that live right next door to him that may have contributed to his mothers death. THE ECHO was a very well written supernatural thriller. From first frame till last it always manages to keep one interested in what is happening. The direction &amp; acting was great &amp; the many twists &amp; turns in the film are very well executed &amp; extra creepy for maximum effect. Plenty of creepy images also add up to the chills &amp; manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommended to horror fans. THE ECHO is definitely a must see!***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>jesse bradford is super hot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay so I'm not sure that I will be a realistic judge of this film. All I know is Jesse Bradford is so freaking hot in this movie it's hard for me to see anything else. But as for the little scares here and there they made me jump a few times and I found the story line interesting. A young man right out of prison takes over his deceased mother's apartment only to discover it's haunted by vicious ghosts. I mean if I'm being honest we've seen this before really well (the ring, grudge) and really horrible (shutter, grudge 2) so this falls right in the middle. It's got some really good moments and some mediocre ones and Jesse Bradford sporting a gorgeous bod and playing a little bit of a tough guy with a heart which he does pretty well with. This is a remake of a thai film I haven't seen so I can't judge it against that. But as for this movie I don't seen any reason why this couldn't have gone to theaters especially when horrible films like the unborn and jennifer's body do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had powerful acting and the plot was good but some scenes made me angry. Sometimes I think the directors have actors do what they think is acceptable for the film not considering whether it's realistic to the audience. What makes a good film is when it's realistic and everybody reacts in a way the majority would. The lesser complaints the better the film. I have several complaints but like I said, it was worth a watch at home. I could think of films that were ruined completely from being unrealistic, which isn't the case here. Like I said, not a strng ghost story but the plot and storyline was good and the acting was dramatic</fullReview>
