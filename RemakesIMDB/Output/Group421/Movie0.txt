		<shortDescription>had to watch it twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just starting out into the vast world of foreign film and having seen this film on many a video store shelf, and knowing that it was considered a sci-fi classic, I thought it would be a good way to spend an evening. Based on the case I was expecting something along the line of typical American sci-fi. Needless to say I was wrong.I watched Solyaris twice in two days, because the first time I saw it I knew that I hadn't processed even a quarter of what I knew was there. I was taken completely aback. The second viewing was extremely rewarding.It was unusual for me, raised as I was on the sledgehammer moralizing and we'll make our point so obvious that there's no way you can miss it because we have no respect for your intelligence way of American film. I'm a huge literature buff, and this was one of the very few films I've confronted that is thoughtful and has so many things to say yet does it in a literary or poetic fashion.You will get out of this film what you bring to it. I've been to so many movies where the audience is not actually participating, it's being attacked. But true art is not domineering; it woos you.So to sum up, I greatly appreciated Tarkovsky's unwillingness to manipulate the viewer. It showed that he had respect for me as a thinking soul, and it is this love and respect for humanity which makes this a truly great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best science fiction movies ever produced. Not because it's filled with gee-whiz gizmos or creepy aliens (it isn't) but because it actually gives you something to think about besides "I wonder how much they spent on *that* shot". When I was a kid, I used to love reading sci-fi because it stimulated my imagination, but as I grew up (especially once "Star Wars" came out), I found that it was harder and harder to find anything remotely resembling imagination or mystery in the genre.Well, this movie has restored my faith in what is possible to achieve under the guise of "sci-fi" (obviously, it's older than "Star Wars", but I didn't see it until years later, when I had basically written off the whole idea of science fiction movies). I saw it 10-15 years ago when it was re-released in the USA and liked it then, but seeing it again recently has convinced me that this is an all-time classic. As I said, it actually stimulates thought (rare enough in most sci-fi movies), but on top of that, it has a real and profound emotional impact that's far beyond what you find in most "dramas", let alone "kid stuff" like sci-fi. If this movie is intended to be an "answer" to "2001" (I'm not convinced that it is), the main contrast is that "Solaris" concerns itself with real human emotions, whereas the most interesting character in "2001" is the computer. For those who complain that it's boring, just go see something else. You'll obviously never get it. If the opening shot of water and plant life didn't tip you off to the fact that this movie is intentionally paced a little bit more deliberately than, say, "Buckaroo Banzai", then you should go out and try to get some sort of clue before watching this movie. It's not boring... it's SLOW. It's *meant* to be slow. Some of the scenes exist solely to set a mood, not to advance the plot. If you can't handle that, then this isn't the movie or you. But if you're able to sit still for 3 hours without squirming, and if you're able to enjoy a movie without having every idea spelled out in giant neon letters, then you just might like "Solaris", and find that it haunts you for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something about this movie, I just can't put my finger on it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that generally stands out most about this movie is that it is long. Very long. And Russian. Very Russian.It raises a lot of interesting questions about the nature of humanity, conscience, love, etc. which, honestly, I'd never thought to ask before, and don't care enough to answer now that they HAVE been asked. (Will Shame really save humanity? Who knows? Maybe. How will it do that? Haven't a clue. Now what's for lunch?) That's not to say I didn't like the movie. I did. It's very beautifully shot, such that I think it would be worth purchasing, even if I never sit through the whole thing again, just so that I can have scenes like "City of the Future" on hand as a reference for my own film-making endeavors.Speaking of which: "City of the Future" is a very long scene consisting entirely of one character driving through the streets of Japan. It's supposed to look like, well, a city of the future, but to modern American audiences, it won't very much. It just looks like a guy driving his car through a series of tunnels, and past a series of skyscrapers, as day turns gradually into night. It goes on for five minutes.But here's the thing, the paradox of this film: It didn't bother me that there is a five minute sequence consisting of nothing but shots of traffic. In fact, I loved it. It's an amazing scene, really quite beautiful in its own way. And a lot of the film is like that. It's slow and confusing, but still, it's never boring. Even once Kelvin gets aboard the Space Station, wherein 90% of the decor looks exactly the same. It's still fascinating to look at.And the weird thing is, I can't figure out why. I mean, when I tried to watch 2001, another very long, beautifully shot movie set largely in space... I was bored literally to tears in the first 10 minutes, and had to shut it off. (No offense to fans of the film; I realize how incredibly crass I am for failing to recognize the genius of 2001. It's something I will just have to come to terms with on my own.) But for some reason, while watching Solaris, even when absolutely nothing was happening, I could not tear my eyes away. I have the strangest feeling that, if I were indeed to watch the movie again--without the subtitles--it could become one of my all-time favorites.I don't know if I can recommend this film to others or not, because I have no idea if anyone else will share my sentiments. I don't know who will understand it and who won't, or who will even think it's worth trying to understand. There are, of course, some people who absolutely love it, and probably even some who understand it (or think they do), because... well, it's a classic, and a movie doesn't become a classic if nobody likes or understands it. But there are probably just as many people who hate it, because... well, it's a three-hour Russian movie.At any rate, though, I think it's at least worth a look. If you find it boring, slow, incomprehensible, whatever... just turn it off. No big deal. But, on the other hand, if you find yourself inexplicably compelled to keep watching, unwilling or unable to tear yourself away for a single frame... well, then, you're welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two truths drive this film: the inadequacy of human-kind to understand the Universe, and the inadequacy of human-kind to understand the human heart.As such, using Lem's original idea, Tarkovsky successfully, explores these themes.We are drawn in, through hauntingly beautiful imagery, to the internal struggles of Kris Kelvin as he attempts to understand feelings of love for his suicided wife, who has been mysteriously resurrected, presumably as an attempt by Solaris to communicate, or torture.Of course Solaris is probably the most original alien ever concocted, (no phone-homes here) and as must be, utterly enigmatic and beyond communication.Be warned, this film is very long, and sometimes slow, but for those who consider themselves science fiction addicts, it is a must view.One of the top 5 sci-fi films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's now been some years since I last watched it. Still, I can't get rid of the impressions of emptiness, absurdity and impossibility to understand (the world, and the human mind) that this movie left into me. It can be violent to your mind, without showing a single violent image (by the way, I often see this movie as a counterpart to Clockwork Orange, even more than to 2001). It can stun you, with ten or twenty minutes of incomprehensible silence. It can deprive you of any certainty in the laws of nature - such as, people only die once - and thus leave you vulnerable and naked.I know that many friends to whom I've shown this move did not understand it. So I'm not saying you'll like it. But this is possibly the best (non-action) sci-fi movie ever made.Watch it at night, alone, when everything out of your home is dark, silent, and cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nobody loves poetry like a Russian!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This line from Dr Zhivago says all you have to know about Tarkovsky. He was a thinker and a poet. An artist who's work was at once smart, engaging and aesthetically beautiful! Solaris is a world that materialized thoughts and absorbs creatures into its own consciousness. "Solaris" is an allegory on man's place in the universe, the twisted concept of reality, the meaning of love, grief and - ultimately - life. Psychiatrist Kris Kelvin goes to the station orbiting the planet-entity to assess whether the madness of it's occupants means all exploration should be discontinued. What he finds there are all the demons he has brought with him. You the viewer shall experience the same thing, for Solaris is an inviting and questioning but never manipulative film. What you'll get out of it depends on what you bring with you.Solaris is often accused of being slow. This is a common misinterpretation: Solaris makes you anxious, and willingly so. Too many segments are like mirrors that invite your mind to venture off into many uncomfortable a place (the traffic scene comes to mind: an allegory for the space voyage but also for fading life and powerlessness). Solaris also makes you fear, with a sense that something isn't quite right and as with the best horror films, what you dread often isn't even on screen. Solaris makes you heart ache on several occasions as well. It makes you miss loved ones and it makes you feel homesick. every additional minute that separates you from the gorgeous opening shots of nature makes you long for Earth.Solaris is many things but above all it is simply more than entertainment: it is a voyage for the senses, like a favorite song that binds countless disconnected feelings and thoughts. It is a poem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic of not knowing where we're going....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the majority of reviewers here, I rate this film as one of the most profound viewing experiences I can remember. While the IMDb guidelines recommend avoiding reference to specific reviews of Solaris within this section, I strongly believe that there is much to be learnt about this movie by evaluating those reviews as a whole.This is clearly either a love or a hate movie. Those who love it describe in detail its effect on them, the feelings it evokes, its significance and the depth of its philosophical enquiry. Those who hate it largely describe it as too slow-paced; boring.What matters to me about this film which I first watched as mesmerised 15 year old is that it is almost entirely the antithesis of Classical Hollywood cinema. It came from behind the Iron Curtain (that dark place whose strange and hidden 'otherness' has, like the plot of any modern movie, now also been laid wide open by capitalist 'democracy'). Its actors were unknown - more like real people than the celebrities the West populates its movies with. Its pace was slow, mesmeric, hypnotic and atmospheric. It was completely free of the kind of 'good triumphs over evil' motif that riddles Hollywood film-making, where 'good' is white-ness, wealth, youth, Westernness and so on.The pleasure of Solaris was that I didn't know what I was watching. I didn't know who I was watching. I didn't know the culture it reflected and - most importantly - I didn't know what was going to happen. Perhaps its only in re-watching the 1971 Solaris that it becomes apparent to me that somewhere along the way we have been stripped of the right to not know; robbed of the true narrative thrill of being led into the dark, magical forest of the unknown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you compare this movie to the Lem's novel there are a lot of differences. But don't compare them. The novel and movie have their own lives. I personally prefer movie. Tarkovsky is going beyond the limits described by Lem. It is not only the problem of Solaris planet and the relationship between main heroes. Tarkovsky reminds everybody that the origin of our problem is us. And all kind of the most important life keys you can find inside yourselves. The great Swedish director Ingemar Bergman said, that Tarkovsky is in the "room" where I just started to knock. You should see this movie if you want to know what is real you and what you really want. The movie is not the answer, but it is the step to your new understanding of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few comments on how to watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the users in his/her comment to the 2002 adaptation of Lem's novel said that this types of movies should be given a new rating, BRBV (or Brain Required Before Viewing).Unfortunately, I have not seen the Sodebergh's version of "Solaris" (I'm pretty sure it can't beat this one, but, given what other people think about it, I can tell that it's worth seeing), but I can assure you that the same can be applied to this movie too.Guys, it's not boring; it is SLOW. There's a huge difference between the two. Boring movies (Daredevil and Attack of the Clones, for instance) make you fall asleep, good slow movies make you think. If you are a kind of person that comes to movie theater just to see some blood and guts on the screen while chewing on buttery popcorn (popcorn eaters are, probably, my biggest pet peeve when it comes to going to the movies here, in the US - there's always some guy sitting right next to you, eating it so loud that you can't hear a darn thing...), this is not a movie for you. And as for those of you who don't fall into that category - well, you also have to be in the right mood for it. If you are constantly thinking about something important that you have to do or if there is a lot of people making a lot of noise around you - don't watch it; you're still going to like it, but you'll lose a lot. You have to concentrate on the movie, it should be the only thing on your mind. Just sit back and... no, not enjoy. Think. Then you'll enjoy it.I am not going to restate the entire plot of the movie, for a lot of people have already done it. Instead, I'm going to try to give you a few clues about some confusing moments in the movie. (Yes, SPOILERS, if that's what you want to call them).1) Oh, that "boring, boring, boring" car ride scene. Attention, popcorn lovers - this is not 21st century Moscow (in fact, it's never mentioned, where the "Earth" part of the movie takes place - it can be Japan as well...). This is not supposed to give you the insight of what the future is like. It is there for one simple reason - to show you that the astronaut in the car, as well as all other characters in the movie, has got nowhere to go. It's all just an endless road.2) Seaweed - it just stands for nature, Earth, as the characters know it. It's there for a reason too, not just to bore the hell out of you.3)The final scene - Kris is not on Earth. He's on Solaris. He himself is a part of the planet's giant "thinking" Ocean now, just like Harey was.Once again - forget about this movie if you like action the most. Go watch Daredevil or wait till the new Matrix comes out. For all others - watch it, it's a sure 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem of sci-fi &amp; much more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haven't seen any other Tarkofsky. I hear that this is the film he is least fond of. I intend to see more of him. As some other reviewer said, I had the feeling through the first one hour or so that some scenes went on for too long, or seemed a bit unnecessary and that it was too slow for the message to clearly be presented. But after a while, the slow pacing DID have a positive impact on the context of the film and on the "dialogue" between the film and the viewer. Anyway, after its plain &amp; simple beginning, when the "action" is taken to the space station things get more and more interesting. No spoon-feeding here, as well. If you want all the mysteries in a film to be solved and explained, then you might not wanna see this, because the film is up to the viewer to think and dive in deep. Anyway, it ended up satisfying and leaving one in thoughts.I am so glad I got to see this fabulous thoughtful movie. It's full of nice visuals and context. A recommendation to all who are fed up with Hollywood crap - but even Hollywood geeks could find many in this, if they can tolerate with the slow pace...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If a Soul has been given to us then maybe our existence only make sense in retrieving it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films are intellectually challenging. Some films need to be thought about afterward. Some films deserve to be re-watched. Solyaris might be among those films as it is in the same time challenging, intriguing and scary. Countless reviews have been written on Solyaris; needless to say lots of them present a feasible explanation for the film. I am proposing my explanation of Solyaris. Not in the details but in the principle. I don't pretend to understand Mr. Tarkovsky better than others I just think this movie deserves to be understood and I hope my view of this film if not exact will help others understand it and why not appreciate it. Often and wrongly presented as Mr. Tarkovsky answer to 2001 A Space Odyssey, Solyaris was undeniably an answer from at the time the USRR to the western World and his cinema emissary Mr. Stanley Kubrick. Even if Mr. Tarkovsky was in awe at the technical achievement that "2001 A Space Odyssey" represented in 1968 he was nonetheless in disagreement with Mr. Kubrick's view of Mankind quest for Truth integrating too much Technology and not enough Humanity. As a result Solyaris might very well be the most humanist science fiction story ever put on film. Stanislaw Lem's novel provided Mr. Tarkovsky with an opportunity to propose his view on this universal and infinite quest for Truth. Mr. Tarkovsky's goal was also to transcend the genre of science fiction as per him a director can not limit himself to a genre. This is one of the many reasons why Solyaris is a difficult film as the audience's references to the sci fi genre are drastically shaken. Right from the beginning we understand that the story is not going to be an easy one to grasp: the cosmonaut Kris Kelvin receives the mission to reach the space station orbiting the intriguing Solyaris, an ocean like planet. His prerogative is to investigate strange events occurring on the orbital station from where the remaining scientists are observing this ocean. One of them Dr. Gibarian has committed suicide and the other two remaining (Dr. Snouth and Sartorius) are haunting by visions coming straight from their respective past. Soon Kelvin understands that the planet is an intelligent being and is materializing these memories. But when he is confronting with the recreation of his deceased wife Hari, his belief and certitude start to be shaken and never will be recovered?the problem is, ours too? As Professor Messenger said in the first chapter the protagonists of the films "are probing the very frontier of human knowledge" but is it proper to artificially establish a knowledge frontier? "By thinking it we are limiting our concept of infinity of Man's knowledge" and therefore we forbid ourselves to comprehend events beyond that frontier. In that perspective the risk is not technological failure but the failure of our mind. The consequence is a profoundly childish but nonetheless human reaction: an attempt to destroy that which we aren't capable of understanding in short, the planet Solyaris. The appearance of the guest Hari created by the Solyaris Ocean reflects on the overall dynamic. Since Kris Kelvin does not understand the reason and the possibility of Hari's presence on the station, he wants to get rid of her by sending her away in a rocket. But when a recreated Hari reappears during the following evening provoking Kelvin's introspection, she by her very presence forces Kelvin to face Truth about himself. However in the same time she allows Redemption. Often left aside, the notion of True Love as a medium for Redemption of the Soul is a theme very much anchored in Solyaris. "Guest" Hari is clearly not Kris Kelvin wife rather a subconscious projection of his own needs of her. Dr. Sartorius's experiment has proved that appearing "Guests" on the station are made of neutrinos elements stabilized by Solyaris force field. However as Hary developed memories, she appears as the most human being among the crew. The cybernetic expert, Dr. Snouth is trapped in his incomprehension of Solyaris, the astrobiologist Sartorius is obsessed by his quest for Knowledge not understanding that pursuing knowledge for the sake of knowledge is indeed vain. The physiologist Gibarian can't reconcile grief and false resurrection. As per Kelvin he seems to be in denial eventually considering Hary as an opportunity to heal his soul. Stripped of Memories and understanding the impact on the crew and their so called "Human Soul" also because of her genuine Love for Kelvin, Hari chooses to commit suicide as if fatality was inherent to human Destiny. By this very act of sacrifice and ultimate Love, she gives birth to her soul. At the end of the movie and through one of the most enigmatic "zoom in" in history of cinema we understand that an island has formed on the surface of Solyaris. We see Kelvin reconciling with his Past as if the Planet will allow him a second chance, a chance to be Human? With the film Solyaris Tarkovsky seems to whisper in our ears that Humanity is not bound to a place but to an act. The planet Solyaris creates from dreams and memories and is strangely echoing Men's creations process (eg. Kelvin father's Will of rebuilding his childhood house as per his memory). The film embarks us in the Search for Ultimate Truth but if this Truth is beyond our comprehension it might be because we are searching in the wrong place. Maybe Truth is hidden inside our very self. If so then finding it is confronting our very Soul. So in essence if a Soul has been given to us then maybe our existence only make sense in retrieving it. In "Voyage in Time" (an autobiographical documentary) Andrei Tarkovsky said he viewed Solyaris as unsuccessful. Allow me to disagree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All time favourite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favourite film and possibly the best film ever made. It's impossible to put into words what I feel about this beautiful poem. Certainly it is uniquely brilliant artistically and seems to be different every time you view it, the dynamics and emotions of the characters shifting hypnotically. It has the feel of a painting in a gallery and the photography is almost expressionist. It really has to be viewed at the cinema only.There was a very clever ad campaign to this film stating it was the Russian 2001. So us ten year olds went to see it thinking we were going to see a special effects extravaganza, and instead we saw, what seemed as a child, interminable shots of lilly's and weeds. It went over our heads but I never forgot the score and its haunting melancholia. Apparently Tarkovsky had a bad time making this film and fell out with his cinematographer. Stanislav Lem also disliked the way Tarkovsky changed the book's theme of optimism in exploring space to one of scepticism in the film. Tarkovsky felt that finally what mattered was the theme of love, that is, doing moral good in the universe, love of family or country, or the place of one's birth. The beginning of one's journey which one always returns to in one's mind which was evocatively shown in the film's climax by the lake, surely one of the great movie moments ever and terribly moving. His ultimate concern was the question of a man's soul which he is unable to deal with while striving for technological betterment. Ultimately he hoped man would reach a stage where he would solely be able to explore his spirituality.I think with all this polemic Tarkovsky missed the fact that this film works as a beautiful love story. If you could turn the clock back there would be no moral life. But in giving Kelvin a second chance to find a greater truth, Tarkovsky also allows us a rare glimpse of love's majesty before it is sullied. The scenes where Kelvin begs Khari's forgiveness and levitates in her arms are the film's great triumphs. His use of Bach is also unforgettable. Unfairly accused of being po-faced, there is also a lot of wise humour in this film if you care to look for it.This film inexplicably does not appear on many, if any, all time great lists. It does have some Sci-Fi nonsense of the day about bombarding the ocean with radiation, whatever that's supposed to do, but does not prevent this film being one of the great masterpieces of cinema. Recently Time Out or Sight and Sound did a survey of the all time top 20 directors and Tarkovsky did not appear but Woody Allen did! There ain't no justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The least successful of all Tarkovsky's works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a great admirer of Tarkovsky's cinema, having discovered films like Mirror, Ivan's Childhood and the Sacrifice a few years ago, and been seduced by the poetry of his imagery, the power of his themes and the depth of his writing. In the entire lexicon of 20th century cinema, he is largely unsurpassed in terms of vision, philosophy and ideology, and easily ranks alongside other genius filmmakers such as Bergman, Kieslowski, and Wong Kar-Wai. When we think of his most-astounding works, like Andrei Rublev, Mirror, Nostalgia, etc, we think of deep, metaphorical angst, internal and external drama, and an intense dedication to his character and an exploration of the world that they inhabit. With these factors largely absent in Solaris (aka Solyaris), one can only come to the conclusion that this is, without a doubt, Tarkovsky's least successful film.Now, I'm aware that this may be something of a controversial opinion (with many hailing Solaris to be amongst the greatest films ever made), however, I'm merely stating my personal view of the film as both a fan of Tarkovsky and as a fan of world cinema in general. I've also seen this film four times and on each subsequent viewing, I've failed to find anything new or invigorating about it, besides those gorgeous and reflective first few scenes on earth. The rest of it hardly feels like a Tarkovsky film at all, but rather, some clinical (post-modern) attempt to re-imagine Kubrick's watershed-work, 2001: A Space Odyssey, only with a more rigid narrative. This, for me, is Tarkovsky's first mistake. You see, what has always set Tarkovsky apart from his peers is his use of narrative, which in his world, doesn't so much unfold, but rather, bloom like a flower (with each petal offering a new interpretation of the events for us to follow). This film has a more classical approach to narrative... sure, there are a few moments of quiet reflection and a nice metaphorical use of memories and recorded emotions, but unlike his two masterpieces that would bookend Solaris, there is simply no conflict between the internal (guilt, depression, love, loss) and the external (ghosts, memories, illusions) ideologies of the script. Plus, there is no multi-layered character history (like the kind we would see in the later film, Nostalgia) and, much more disappointingly, there are no real games being played with the narrative.Solaris is as straight as Tarkovsky's cinema gets, even down to the use of cinematography, which here seems clumsy, forced and amateurish... a real disappointment after the elegant compositions and visual exploration of time and space found in his most enthralling works (think about that scene with the burning house in Mirror, or those closing black and white moments from Stalker, then compare them to the realisation of the space-station here). It isn't quite the ponderous and enigmatic work of cinematic tedium that some have labelled it - as it does offer is a fair amount of tension, atmosphere and grand-design - but, at the same time, it's not the life-altering work that Tarkovsky is capable of (and the original book unarguably is!!). I blame this on two factors, firstly, Tarkovsky seems to have remained faithful to the overall narrative flow of Lem's great book (creating a clear beginning, middle and end that dreams and nightmares can then invade)... however, he has subsequently missed the point of the book and jettisoned many important moments and details that would have clarified the proceedings. Because of this, the film comes across as muddled and at times highly detached; something that is not helped by the lack of emotion and feeling demonstrated by the performers.The other problem is Tarkovsky's lack of understanding when it comes to the science-fiction genre, which, by design is geared around storytelling; something that Tarkovsky has regularly shown little interest in. He also strains to visually over-emphasise the workings of the space station, with lots of close-ups and cut-aways, which simplifies Tarkovsky's usually grand poetic vision, and is a real waste of the cinema-scope process that the filmmaker was here using (it would be the last time he would work in cinema-scope, with subsequent films employing the more traditional 1.66:1 academy ratio). Still, Tarkovsky would re-attempt science fiction several years later with his great film Stalker; a deeply existential trawl through the remains of a post-apocalyptic city, and one man's damaged soul. Stalker succeeds over Solaris because the director could internalise the science-fiction elements and transform the story from technical exploration into the notion of personal redemption. Lem's book is more evasive in terms of the character's intentions and diverts his emphasis onto the plot - rightly so for a novel - which has seemingly forced Tarkovsky to compromise his trademark style.If you're adamant about watching Solaris, then by all means do so... but don't feel obliged to proclaim it a masterpiece when, in comparison with the filmmaker's other works, it clearly isn't. I don't mean to sound quite so arrogant about it, but this film, for me, really doesn't standout as anything wholly life-affirming, in the way that other Tarkovsky films can be. It just seems to lack the emotional impact of Mirror and Nostalgia, or the human element so prevalent in Ivan's Childhood and The Sacrifice. It also lacks the epic quality of the vast historic piece, Andrei Rublev, which pretty much-defined Tarkovsky's cinematic style...which is perhaps why Tarkovsky himself considered it the least successful of all his films. Really, if you're looking for an introduction to Tarkovsky's work that might just succeed in changing your life, then try Mirror, Nostalgia, or the epic Andrei Rublev.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring...boring...boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trust me, if you watch this film, you'll fall asleep long before having to watch the subsequent freeway scene, the most boring scene in cinema history and a benchmark in sleep inducement.I can understand Tarkovsky's desire to draw the viewer into the film, and it is a sincere effort, but scenes which could have taken a few seconds are drawn out like taffy. The opening grasses-in-the-water scene seems to be saying something important: "look at the water, bozo". So you look, and look, and you look some more and you don't find anything of value except the realization that you are an idiot for watching this film at all. This is a highly conceptual film, appealing to two groups: either that minority of people who have actually read the novel and can understand every scene, and that other minority of people who pretend to like this film just because its Russian and just because it's well-loved by the other minority of people who continuously point out its profundity. If they set out to make a boring film, they couldn't have done any better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do we need the unknown for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lem wrote a book about this question, Tarkowski made a film. And unlike stated by Lem about Tarkowski, Tarkowski did not demonise the unknown, but brought forth Lem's own opinion in Lem's own words, that the unknown is of very little use for a creature as preconditioned as the human being is.I almost heard Immanuel Kant behind it. But what surprise? The main character of this film is an ocean on a planet called Solaris, about which we have reason to believe that it owns some sort of intelligence, which then makes itself apparent to us by apparitions. Yes... what exactly said Kant about God? An idea we cling to, because that is our duty, to examine the world as if it were created by an intelligent and benevolent being. Where the world is the medium through which our existence becomes filled and thus becoming able to develop itself. Any similarities with this film and Lem's novel are of course completely... coincidental? I don't think so, no. But the originality of the concept is of no importance anyway. Who understood Kant? And who understands this film? The naivety and clarity of view that Tarkowski proves here are what make this film an unparalleled masterpiece, a one of a kind. I cannot say how much I enjoyed it.Besides, there's more than a conceptual link to Kant, there are two Baltic Actors involved (playing Kelvin and Snaut) and Tarkowski has the same love for nature that Kant had, so, things just match.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's Solaris has been a profound and inspirational film for me and I have really appreciated reading the novel as well as watching the Criterion edition of the film. I specially appreciate the use of Bach's organ Choral prelude throughout the film, particularly during a scene where Kelvin and Hari (Rheya) are reminiscing. The picture and sound quality of the Criterion edition are remarkable and make the film a treat to watch. Donatis Banionis' and and Natalya Bondarchuk's performances were exceptional and this film has left lasting impressions on my mind. Bergman's 'Persona' and Kurasawa's 'Dreams' inspired me similarly and I look forward to watching Tarkovsky's 'Andrei Rublev'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Tarkovsky is on my very short list of transcendental filmmakers. Some of his films have changed my life. Those masterpieces balance an overall structured ambiguity with complex visual meditations. One would think this film would similarly transform, but it doesn't. It is not as big a failure as `Sacrifice' but it fails for the same reason.That reason is because he travels from the worlds he creates and controls. Here it is science fiction in general and Lem's world in particular. With `Sacrifice' it was to the west in general and Bergman's world in particular. In both cases, the alien world would seem a natural fit for Tarkovsky?s underlying concerns of mind creating realities and yearning for greater perfection based on invented pasts (inexactly called nostalgia by some). Future invented image drawn from past invented image presented through a synthetically imaged present.The problem is that science fiction (and Bergman for that matter) are too bound to narrative for Tarkovsky's imagination. He likes to capriciously weave huge strands while fraying small ones. He NEEDS to particularize in the instant at the same time he untethers physics. This the is exact opposite of how it works in the worlds he visits.A relatively insignificant result is that the created future is not convincing as a different world where abstractions are skewed. A larger defect is the general problem of us as viewers working too hard to make sense where we think there might be some instead of just gliding emotionally as we can through `Rublev' and `Mirror' and `Nostalgia.'Yes this has some fine moments, but that's never been what he is about. I see this as proof that the man was an artist because he wasn't afraid to venture too far and try on unfamiliar environments. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russians in Space A Science-Fiction Parable on the Nature of Mankind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nation's image of outer space reflects itself. Jules Verne's moon train was a small wagon-lit. American science-fiction movies stress the gleaming pipes and dials, a kind of hi-fi waterworks. Andrei Tarkovsky's "Solaris," gives us Russian outer space. I say Russian rather than Soviet because this complex and sometimes very beautiful film is about humanity but hardly at all about politics. In any case, the space station on the planet Solaris has an absent-minded neglect about it that could have come straight out of Dostoyevsky's study. There is a suspicion of rust on the pipes, and the furniture would look at home in the Omsk railroad station. One has the feeling that wrappers of half-eaten sausage are lying just out of sight and that a samovar is at work. Outer space is shabbiness, lots of tea and urgent philosophical discussions that leave no time for shaving. Nothing that's visible matters very much?except for nature: shots of a pond of water weeds of a running horse?and life's surface are quite unimportant. Because of it, the blockish camera work, the egg-like colors and the general visual poverty are almost irrelevant. What matters is the conversations, the problems they raise, the faces that reflect them, seen blurrily as if at the end of an all-night session. Mr. Tarkovsky, who is known here for a truncated version of "Andrei Rublev," made "Solaris" from the novel by the Polish writer Stanislaw Lem. It is science-fiction in the formal sense of the word; in substance, it is a parable about the nature of mankind. Set in some future time, it is about the voyage of Chris Kelvin to the space station on the planet Solaris. The Academy of Sciences has found no profit in the long studies made of the planet. Chris's mission is to talk with the three scientists at the station and to report on closing it down. The surface of Solaris is something like a sea, a great pulsating mass. A previous scientist, Burton, has come back in severe nervous shock; he believes that it may not be a sea but a superior order of consciousness, a great brain, in fact. Chris, a haunted but practical man, a missioner of human progress, is prepared to order a final experiment: a massive infusion of radiation into the "sea." Burton, now older, is horrified. "You must not destroy what you don't understand," he says. Chris's father, a solitary, severe man, is also appalled. "Space is too fragile for your kind," he says. The whole long, strange trip develops the theme. Mankind, with its aggressive expansionism ? intellectual as well as material?destroys more than it finds. Chris is the practical man who, by the film's end, will be converted. He finds that the space station, that summit of technology, is a heart of darkness. All three scientists there have been shattered by encountering the mystery of the planet. Solaris is, in fact, a great consciousness. Thought is made reality there, including the deepest thoughts of its visitors. One has killed himself, leaving behind an obscure message on videotape for Chris. As he explores the decrepit space station?almost visibly rusted by the presence of a greater reality?Chris finds the other two. Sartorius, who will not accept what he can't understand, barricades himself in his laboratory surrounded by dwarfs?his thoughts made substance. Snouth, more innocent and hopeful, drinks a lot, but his visitors are children. Chris has arrived with the suicide of his wife, Hari, on his conscience. Hari begins, nevertheless, to visit him. She is not an apparition; she is a yearning that the Solarian sea has given substance and built?the other scientists explain?of neutrinos. But she becomes more and more human until, in an act of abnegation, she asks to be destroyed so Chris can return to earth.Put in summary, the plot may seem ludicrous. "Solaris" has its problems. Its rhythm is slow, and sometimes is extinguished altogether. The narrative can be difficult to grasp. Finally, as the film draws into conclusion, the parable seems to unclothe; the sense of wonder that Mr. Tarkovsky has created yields to a certain didacticism. All of these drawbacks must be cited provisionally. "Solaris," whose mystical, totally nonmaterialistic character has won it no other favor in the Soviet Union than the permission to exist, is on DVD in a severely truncated form. The original was reportedly four hours long; a second version, shown in Cannes and elsewhere at the time of its release, was 2 hours and 47 minutes. The version we are seeing is down to 2 hours and 12 minutes and the distributors, who received it that way, say they don't know whether Mr. Tarkovsky supervised the cuts before his death. Obviously it is impossible to judge the pace, the rhythms and the clarity of a film that is cut nearly in half. It is like a fresco partly eaten away by rising damp. The result must be viewed actively and with some effort. But if it is, the result is extraordinary enough to compensate. The film's great metaphors?the faces of Donatis Banionis as Chris, Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari and Yuri Jarvet as Snouth?involve us totally in the difficult mysteries. Like his Solarian sea, Mr. Tarkovsky has made ideas walk, breathe and move us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most interesting, hypnotic pieces of science fiction ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solaris works on the level of dreams and nightmares; not always making perfect sense after awakening, but very believable within the time-frame it occurs. Director/co-screenwriter Andrei Tarkovsky creates a lengthy 40-odd minute prologue on earth that is not in the book (by Stanislaw Lem); but feels organic to the story nevertheless. And it establishes the kind of cynical man Kris Kelvin (played in layers by Donatas Banionis) is before he goes to the Solaris station. Which orbits a planet with a living, sentient (and utterly alien) ocean. The ocean was subjected to illegal experiments with x-rays, and it responded by invading the minds of the space station's crew. Conjuring "visitors" created by neutrinos from the crew's subconscious. Kris boards the station to find two survivors, Snaut and Sartorious. Each are grappling with their own visitors when a confused Kelvin encounters them. But then, Kelvin's own visitor appears in the form of his dead wife Hari from 10 yrs. before. And for Kris, the lines between reality/fantasy, humane/inhumane are soon forever blurred. That's the short description of the plot, but this is a film that is less about plot and action (it's not Star Wars!) and more about introspection and the possibility of losing oneself in a illusionary world. The station itself is at times cluttered and dirty, and then sterile and surreal. A remarkable production design. The alternating sunlight (for different times of day) shining through the portholes reminds us of time moving forward, even when the characters cannot. The actors are believable all around, especially Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari in a performance that suggests an alien intelligence that first mimics, and then slowly begins to understand humanity. I also enjoyed Yuri Yarvet as the burnt-out Professor Snaut. A world-weary, tired, shell of a man; always a bit drunk to some degree. The brief scenes depicting the "living sea" itself are slightly psychedelic and remind me just a bit of the "light-trip" landscapes of 2001. Many have called this film the "Soviet 2001," but that's not really a valid comparison. It's like comparing "Star Wars" and "Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind" because they're both major sci-fi films that came out in 1977. It's not a fair comparison. One aspect Solaris DOES have in common with 2001 (and it's something I miss in modern sci-fi) is that it takes time to lull you into its world by letting images and moods linger, in worlds without time pressure. Solaris also alternates between black and white and color (a Tarkovsky trademark) to great effect. Especially for day/night or video/viewer transitions. Ultimately, the movie is a rich, but melancholy examination of the natures of reality and humanity, with the alien ocean acting as a mirror we hold to ourselves. It's a film experience that demands (and richly rewards) repeat viewings, but it's NOT for short attention spans. Or for those who like their sci-fi with straight lines and clear-cut solutions and answers. Solaris is about all the messiness and meanings between the lines, where humanity truly exists!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it's long, drawn out, and doesn't make a lick of sense, it has a special place in my heart.I write this review after the first viewing, which means it's probably not a good one as this is one of those movies that requires multiple viewings so that things start falling into place. Years of Lynch and Kubrick movies have taught me to take the first watch a little easily, and to let things come together on their own accord in subsequent viewings.Thus, the surface review: Solaris is a project. Somewhere in space and time exists an Ocean (capitalized) which has a manned satellite studying it. Historically, this scientific mission has been controversial because not only has it completely failed to progress, it actually tends to digress scientific progress and cause the scientists on the duty to sometimes as much as go insane.A psychologist named Kris Kelvin (played by somebody whose name I could never hope to pronounce or spell) goes to the satellite after one of the remaining three scientists (in a station built for 85) kills himself. There he meets Hari, his dead ex-wife. Romance, philosophy, and the meaning of life ensues, revolving around the significant "Other" (this time related as a significant other, haha) so important to science fiction.This movie is very thick, and very Russian. Being that it's like a Russian 2001: A Space Odyssey, I feel pretty safe in saying, "This isn't for everyone." However, if it sounds right up your alley, here's the things you can come to expect: 1) Beautiful imagery. Absolutely amazing from frame one to last moment.2) Great directing. I can see why this guy's mentioned almost as much as Eisenstein when someone brings up the subject "Russian directors." 3) Creepiness. Mirrors, stuff moving out of the corner of your eye, all that stuff that keeps the relatively slow exposition rather harrowing for the viewer sitting there thinking, "It's just a simple matter of WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?" (I thank you, MST3K).And more... Just be prepared for three hours of cinema, and you're good to go.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.Many people shall disagree with that statement: For them, "Solaris" is a slow, boring and meaningless movie. If you, dear reader, find yourself among this group of people, please read my arguments against this theory.First of all, the cinematography is simply sublime. I hope no-one argues with that point. The visual beauty of this film was surely ground-breaking for its time -in on some aspects, it still is. Secondly, the actors are amazing. All of them.Thirdly -and here lies the crucial question: does the movie has anything to say?- the movie has indeed a lot to say. But what is it? And how does it show it? OK, I think we need to get some things straight: In an art movie, there are two things one should notice: What does it say, and, much more than this,how does it say it? Art doesn't intend to actually say something. Her role is to show. If there is a message, it exists in 1,000,000 different forms -one for each spectator. Therefore, in my opinion, the famous 'car scene' (and every black-and-white scene in the movie), in my viewing aspect, shows the following: every time one feels lonely or has too much on his mind, the screen becomes colorless. Is there a message? In my opinion: Let loose of your subconscious, your dreams, your consciousness. These are the things no-one can steal from you.Is this the best movie ever made? Probably... but there's also "Stalker"...</fullReview>

Special effects, where attempted, were dire. Similar in ambition to Kubrick's 2001, this lacked the artistic beauty, quality of sound and atmosphere and the plot, while interesting, unfolded so painfully slowly it gave me a headache.I'm not going to give away the ending -- because I'm sad to say that after two hours I walked out, a very rare thing.

		<fullReview>Has there ever been a slower film? Whatever vision or theme director Andrei Tarkovsky was trying to convey, almost certainly more viewers would have been exposed to it and possibly mesmerized, if the film had been imbued with a modicum of entertainment value. "Solyaris" has got to be one of the most boring, and pretentious, movies ever made.Ostensibly a sci-fi film, the first 43 minutes take place in a most mundane, earth-like setting, with visuals that do not in any way suggest anything cosmic or other-worldly. Later, the plot shifts to a spacecraft. But even here, the sets are mundane and unimaginative. They look like what one would see in an episode of Star Trek.None of the film's characters are remotely interesting. Dialogue and acting are both melodramatic. At times, I thought I was watching a soap opera. The film has absolutely no humor. The overall tone is serious and dour. Background music is funereal and gloomy. The film's first Act is confusing and muddled.The cinematography has very, very long camera "takes", and is mostly color, but shifts to B&amp;W at odd times, for no apparent reason. Five consecutive minutes are consumed by a car traversing a freeway in Japan (and this is a Russian film?); there's no dialogue in this sequence, nothing but a car moving along through a city, first in daylight, then at night. Nor does the sequence advance the plot in any discernible way. Throughout the film, sound effects are amplified, apparently to keep viewers awake.With a ponderous and painfully slow plot that runs nearly three hours, no humor, melodramatic dialogue and acting, and an abstruse theme, "Solyaris" comes across not only as tedious and utterly lacking in entertainment value, but also extremely pretentious. For most viewers, I would recommend a pillow or a deck of cards. One should at least be able to get in a lengthy nap or several games of solitaire for having to endure this dreary cinematic ordeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solaris was my first Tarkovsky movie. I got the Criterion Edition, and read the companion booklet first. And I was very sure I was going to like this film. I read reviews here and again was reassured I was going to like it. Some of my most favorite films are slow thinking movies, I love Michaelangelo Antonioni's movies, Bergman's movies, Godard's films, and I love 2001 space odyssey. I enjoy the more symbolic expressions of cinema in general. For instance the way Coppola cuts together the sacrifice of the bull with the murder of Kurtz in apocalypse now.So i was very excited and sure that Solaris was going to be great. I watched it and I thought it was terrible. And I am someone who will acknowledge or give respect to a film even if I don't personally "enjoy" it or am "entertained" by it but I thought this was bad.1.) Color to black and white: Later on in the movie the film stock changes to black and white to better illustrate dream sequences... but Tarkovsky is not consistent with this approach because earlier on in the film it changes to black and white for no reason. Am I missing something here? 2.) Cheap production: their is countless flaws in many different aspects, for instance the terrible zoom shots, and panning shots look very amateurish. The sound was terrible as well many times there would be no sound effects for obvious things like a car's engine. This film was made after 2001 and its FX aren't even close to being on the same level.3.) Too long with too few ideas: Being long alone doesn't mean anything really. Tarkovsky gives you plenty of time to understand what the main characters problem is. The character is told for nearly two hours that his wife isn't real, and I understand that the drama of the film is created out of the tension of knowing that the relationship doesn't exist, and that the main character only wants it to but for two hours! This isn't a mind bending concept that calls for such obsession. I think that the audience understands the problem within a half an hour.4.) Bad ending: to make matters worse the problem or conflict that arises for two hours of the film is resolved in a very anti climactic way. After he has came to terms with his loss she simply isn't seen again.5.) Tarkovsky's failure I don't see any evidence of metaphysical Pudovkin editing techniques. or Igmar Bergman symbolism, or even any sort of response to 2001.The few discussions about philosophy and life are pretty stock discussions and aren't really that interesting or in relevance with the plot.The levitation sequence isn't anywhere near as effective as it seems in Tarkovsky's sacrifice.6.) Solaris is a SciFi movie... nothing more: In comparison to 2001 Tarkovsky's Solaris dwells more in human emotion... that's true but so does Forbidden Planet which I found more similar to Solaris than 2001.I may have been expecting too much, or expecting the wrong thing from this film but I was severely disappointed. The "surprise" ending was not much of a surprise, and not very thought provoking. It seemed almost like an ending found on the Twilight Zone.Solaris involves some thought, there is a few interesting ideas, but its not groundbreaking or a masterpiece, and the idea that this film is even considered to be linked to 2001 is silly.7.) A few good points: having said that i don't mean to bash the entire film. I found the first hour very interesting and engaging. I didn't mind the nature shots. The car scene, I thought, was one of the best sequences shot, edited and scored pieces of the movie though I have no idea what it had to do with the plot. One review on the board suggested that it shows how the astronaut has nowhere to go... okay... so what though? What does it matter? In contrast the nature shots seem to serve importance because Nature will be severely missed by the astronauts. but an astronaut/2ndary character driving around in a car because he has nowhere to go? 8.) In conclusion: The cinematography was cheap, the pacing of the film was completely silly. Not once in 2001 is Kubric being slow just for the sake of being slow. there are 3 or 4 minute shots of nothing but spaceships spinning but the FX and cinematography are breathtaking.Solaris is tediously slow and the few ideas and themes that are brought up are spelled out just as clearly as most Kate Winslet movies. And the film is cheap. Tarkovsky obviously didn't have enough money. The movie goes from color to black and white for no reason, the sound design is terrible. The acting is pretty shaky, and the FX are terrible. There are no real twists or turns in plot, the film just doesn't ever take off.Like I said this was my first Tarkovsky film. But I considered it extremely overrated. i read other comments before posting to see if maybe I missed something. one person included clues for viewing Solaris the algae, the car, the ending, all of which I understood pretty matter-of-factually after the first viewing.Please if I'm missing something here i would like to know just what everyone likes about this film so I can at least respect it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book has been translated so many times and each of the translations have given me a different insight into the story and the philosophy of Solaris, but this only creates a literal equivalent of schizophrenia, strangely with this film i have found a dynamic that is similar to horror movies, the stillness creates anxiety, the slowness almost brings fear and the sheer beauty of the imagery causes conflict. I guess that it is in that conflict that Tarkovsky scores because I found the journey through this story emotional, ( who knows maybe my ancestors were Russian?)All in all as a fan of the book i expected this to be a let down but was really shocked to almost find yet another translation.So even though this film is in my personal top twenty I really do not know if I can recommend it to others, possibly because one of its issues is that Humanity wants mirrors not aliens, but if you want an alien experience then I can recommend this.</fullReview>

It reminds me of Dr. Zhivago in the scope and otherworldliness of the lingering shots. The meditative nature of this film is likely beyond the attention span of many viewers who are accustomed to Mission to Mars and Avatar type movies but in my mind, this film is the essence of science fiction-the search without to find the truth within.The acting is top-notch. The cinematography is miraculous. The effects are few and not much needed in any case-the scene is set and explained with no bells and whistles, only one fiery explosion, and no green-skinned alien monsters whatsoever. If only more filmmakers set their ambitions this high!Highly recommended, but watch when you have plenty of time and patience.

Most good things have been mentioned in the other comments, so let me just point out a few scariest moments. It's like a top 5 to me.No.5 The astronaut's tale of what he has seen in the space. Pure "loading" upon one's imagination.No.4 A midget that really appears quite unexpectedly on the space station. The impression is: "Damn, where does this freak come from?" No.3 Somebody unknown lying in the old man's bed. A very fleeing and frightening moment.No.2 The woman tearing the metal door apart. A most terrific scene.No.1 The bells ringing behind the door. It comes closer and closer. The main character starts to block the door with all things he can find.Re-shooting such movies cannot be a good idea. Some films remain essential and cannot be successfully remade. Like Carpenter's "The Thing", like Cameron's "The Terminator", like Scott's "Alien", like McTiernan's "Predator", you can continue this list yourself, though it is not a long one.An adult movie without swearing, gore, and sex.A Soviet/Russian sci-fi of "10 out of 10" calibre.

		<fullReview>The long, Soviet version of Lem's novel is enigmatic and, well, long. It has long scenes.Among the movie's enigmas are why the directer bounced back and forth between color and black and white. In "Memento" we can figure it out. Here in Solaris, I have no clue. But that enigma pales in comparison with what the heck is going on. The Soviet version follows the novel more closely than Soderbergh's 2002 version, but the novel itself is a dense, thick book which has as its thesis that we will never be able to understand alien life forms, no matter how hard we try to communicate. I'll suggest that this is a metaphor for alienation in the Soviet Union under communist rule: we can never know what other humans are telling us because we can't tell if they're hiding their true feelings, trying to trap us into making criminal admissions, trying to avoid making criminal statements, or whatever. Further, there's the plain inability to communicate effectively which is shared by all humans, whether under tyrannical rule or not.We see Kelvin with his father, mother, and aunt at their dacha shortly before Kelvin leaves for Solaris. Kelvin burns most of his papers; apparently his trip will take decades in earth time, and neither Kelvin nor his father expects the father to be alive when Kelvin returns. There is a cloudburst, and Kelvin remains out in it, letting it drench him.SPOILERS--------------Kelvin arrives on the space station un-aged, and we see the bewildering circumstances which the shipmates (Snaut and Sartorius) fail or refuse to explain to Kelvin. After Kelvin sleeps, his dead wife is in his room with him. It seems all the other crew members have had what they term "visitors," too. One crewmember, Gibarian, has killed himself. He had a visitor, but no one knows why he committed suicide. Kelvin puts his wife in a rocket and sends her off, but the next time he wakes up, she's with him again - another visitor.The problem with the movie is that Tarkovsky can't show us the problem effectively. Lem's point of view (as I understand it, and I may be wrong) is that we won't even recognize communication from an alien - it will be totally alien to us, unrecognizable as communications. The issue isn't as simple as translating the languages; it's the problem of determining that what's going on is an attempt to talk. The alien in this version of Solaris (and in the novel) is the "ocean" on the planet. It can move and change its shape. It appears to be reading people's memories as they sleep, then it sends a visitor to each person based on the memories. The visitors however, are all defective in some way, and Kelvin and his revived wife (Hari in this film) can't figure out whether her defect (she keeps committing suicide but returning to life) is the result of Kelvin's memory (his overriding memory is that she killed herself but he could have prevented it if he'd paid more attention to what was going on) or some defect in how Solaris is creating Hari.Ultimately for Hari, the cause of her defect is irrelevant, and she is desperately unhappy. Sartorius figures out a way to annihilate her so that she doesn't return to life, and she leaves Kelvin with only her note. Kelvin somehow beams his encephalogram to the ocean, and the visitors stop. Apparently Snaut and Sartorius decide to depart for earth. We get a scene of Kelvin back on earth walking around the pond near his dacha, but the water is solid. He goes to the dacha, and his father is inside, where it is pouring rain, drenching him. Kelvin's father sees Kelvin, comes outside, Kelvin falls to his knees, and embraces his father. The camera pulls back further and further, and we see that the land around the dacha is an island formed by the ocean, so this scene is being played out on the planet. (This is why the water is solid and it rains indoors - the creation is always defective.)I have no clue from the movie whether Kelvin stayed, going down to the surface and this is him we see; or whether this is a memory created by Solaris from the encephalogram, and this Kelvin is a visitor, as is the father. If this is the real Kelvin, we get a feeling of Kelvin returning home (albeit in his memory) and receiving his father's forgiveness, but for what I do not know. The reconciliation of father and son has some meaning, even if I can't figure out what the separation was; there's a communication between the two by touch and presumably by emotional feelings. This might be seen as a hopeful ending.If Kelvin went home and this entire scene is a creation by Solaris, then I'm guessing Solaris has intuited that humans communicate by sharing emotions. If Solaris is utterly silent, then this would be a sensible guess on Solaris's part - it has no knowledge of sound and speech, so it would miss that entirely. It may be then, that after everyone left, Solaris has a key to how to begin communication. If this is the case, then the ending is bleak. The experiment in communicating with Solaris was years long and failed.Perhaps ironically, I'm in the same boat with Kelvin, Snaut, and Sartorius: I have no clue what Tarkovsky is trying to tell me. I have too little information to make a guess I'm comfortable with. I could watch the movie again, but it's two hours and forty minutes, and I'm not willing to invest that much time again - ironically perhaps, like the crew leaving when Solaris finally found a key to communicating. C'est la vie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Approach of First Contact and Alien Lifeform</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the scientist Fechner disappears in the surface of the mysterious Solaris Ocean, the experienced helicopter pilot Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky) crosses a fog seeking out Fechner and has weird visions. His statement is presented to a commission of scientists that believe he had hallucinations. However, the widowed psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) is assigned to the space station that orbits Solaris to check the mental health of the three remaining scientists that are still working there. He first meets Dr. Snaut (Jri Jrvet), who tells him that Dr. Gibarian (S. Sarkisyan) committed suicide, and later he meets Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) and he realizes that the scientists have strange behaviors. When he encounters his wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), who died ten years ago, in the space station, the scientists explain to Kris that the Solaris Ocean has the ability to materialize the innermost thoughts in neutrons beings. Kris questions whether the appearance of his beloved wife is a curse or a blessing."Solyaris" is an original (or maybe the most original) approach to first contact and alien life-form in the cinema history. The story is disclosed in an extremely low-pace through a flawed screenplay (at least for those like me that have not read the novel) that uses many ellipsis and poor art decoration, but beautifully raises philosophical questions about love, death, understanding, communication, fear for the unknown, origin of life, and Solaris Ocean might be the Paradise or even God. The intriguing story is open to interpretations and not recommended for those viewers that expect to see a conventional sci-fi movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Solaris"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even if memory fails me, won't forget Solaris!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw Solaris (Criterion DVD), twice! But the surprising part (to me anyway), was not that I saw Solaris back to back. Its that I made a conscious decision to watch on both occasions, without the audio commentary. "Waste of time", so some may think of me right now. Why don't I siphon off other's intellectual/ experiential insights? Why don't I just stand on the shoulders of these Tarkovsky aficionados? Why not just immediately devour their meticulous research inputs and vastly valuable film knowledge? Well, all I can say is that, at its most basic level, a master like Tarkovsky defies explanation. What anyone else (including myself) can bring to it, are our mere admiration and personal readings into his film's thematic intents. So based on last night's "looping" session, I cared not what others have to say of this film (yet). This was my first Tarkovsky. And he impaled me on this forceful first impact alone. A personal response was triggered, and I'm thus more than willing to forego scholastic credibility. I shall go ahead now and just stake my own emotional claims on this very dead Russian, right here, right now... Through Solaris, Tarkovsky touched on issues close to the melancholic turmoil that's my heart. It generously fed the neediness that starved my restless mind. By exploring issues both grand and intimate, Tarkovsky masterfully concocted a band aid for my existential curiosity. In short, it afforded me a glimpse into what spiritual closure feels like. For realistically, I can never be cured.... Memory. Regrets. Loss. Pain. Etc. These are words I have grown to hate in recent years. For they all come with a heavy baggage. And like most, carry it I must, for they still shackled my being (and probably will continue to do so, for the rest of my life). Breaking free of such chains are easier said than done. But in order to live, we cope. And cope we must, on a day by day basis. Which brings me to the movie.... Of course, a film like Solaris does not miraculously promise resolution to all those pesky burdens. But at the very least, it offered this pretentiously tortured soul, a reprieve. It made me realise that struggling with our inner demons are what makes us uniquely, humans. That however evolved we are intellectually, we are very similar on the emotional level. Whatever our social/ ideological divide, we all rejoice, despair, regret and accept (or not). This affinity to humanity speaks loudly to me. For collectively, we need be aware that we are all struggling to attain happiness/ contentment. In this life, the fight will be long and hard. But how it all ends, will depend largely on the strength of our own resolves and our willingness to reconcile with life's misgivings (something which memory often don't let us easily forget). For better or worse, Solaris thus allowed me the opportunity to wise up to the futility of languishing in such imprisoning ill sentiments. In fact, I may have effectively wasted time articulating the contents of this and the last paragraph. Silly me.Overall, it was sweetly divine, this Solaris experience. I got to watch this film at a time I dictated and in the undisturbed comfort of my own living space. I was allowed to just look at this pensive film with a restful mind, and be awe-inspired using my willing senses. And in so doing, even the "cinematic dead spaces" which that background noise mentioned, came alive. The feelings this ambitiously humane film gave me, were hence a transcendent one. For whatever its worth, I am forever grateful for Solaris' timely company. And if what most critics said are true; that this masterpiece was but one of the Russian master's lesser works, then I'll be damned for sitting on my fat ass now. For henceforth, the sinnerman shall set out and chase the rest of Tarkovsky's six mighty creation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know why this is not recognized to be the religious masterpiece it is. This is the way I see things in the movie:There are things in one's conscience one does not want to come face-to-face with. [And it is not "your deepest fears", one of the most overworked Hollywood cliches!]. If you believe in eternity, then there is Judgment Day or the doctrine of Karma, where one day, you have to face the truths that you so badly want to forget.This idea of repentance is a cornerstone in any religion.How will you peddle this idea in a society where eternity is banished? Where there is no reality except a scientifically provable one? Well, I think you put it inside a scientific wrapper - like man's odyssey to a distant planet, Solaris.Solaris is heaven, it is judgment day - it is not a punishment as the scientists on the space station believe, it is a chance for repentance. The ocean provides a second chance - like Gibaryan, you can be so ashamed of the past that you refuse to face it even the second time around, and you go to hell - or like Kris Kevin, you can rectify things the second time around. This, probably, is heaven.There are comments regarding why this movie is inferior because it does not stick to Stanislaw Lem's Solaris. I think that this, as art, holds an exalted position than shallow science-fiction could never hope to achieve.This is Science-Fiction, as Dostoevsky would have created it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insightful adaption of sci-fi classic Stanislav Lem novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's take a point at the beginning - everyone who could try to criticize, write, direct or even be casted in the sci-fi movie, should read Stanislav Lem novels, and most of them, Solaris. Lem was not only a writer of sci-fi, but also scientist who discussed about future of humanity - Solaris and several philosophical sci-fi works are the best example.Solaris is a work who takes a look of human nature of discovery and knowledge and where it all leads and where it all will stop. That actually all knowledge and discovery is useless without humans, without humanity. It all worthless. Without love, space is worthless.All story is covered by other reviewers so I just point out several pros and cons of the adaptation. First It must be pointed out that movie is purely work of art and it *is* slow for common movie watcher. It builds for the very good, but complex climax so you have to wait for that. So don't be afraid or bored, just try to stay for the best parts of the movie. Second, many will point out that it is Soviet movie, but in fact, as I live in the former Soviet state, now independent Latvia, I must admit that this is the movie that contains very few, if any propaganda points. I must admit that DVD version is very good for it's quality and sound master - colors are sharp, sounds are very good. So I suggest to buy it if you want add another classic to your sci-fi section. Another point is perfect works of actors and good script. Lem's work is very big and complex and in actual style doesn't fit in normal movie, so it is rather good try. So I personally would suggest this Lem's work as mandatory read for schools as it provides numerous questions and answers about human nature and science's true mission. Movie is not as good as book (but it is almost impossible to compare), but it is almost perfect. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

I ought to have known, I am that sort of person.So comes December 2009, and Film 4 show both Solaris films. I sat transfixed by the Russian film. Visually it is a thing of beauty, and it is a rare thing - a film which requires input from the viewer. This movie requires you to think for yourself...and some people find that difficult.I enjoy a rip-snorting entertaining action movie as much as most people, but rare films like Solaris leave me feeling so much more fulfilled. There are ambiguities, not so much loose ends untied as dots which the viewer is required to connect for himself.Try Solaris. If you find yourself twiddling your thumbs after 15 minutes then its probably not for you. If you find yourself glued to the screen then you know how I feel about this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no argue about the fact that Stanislaw Lems "Solaris" is probably the most important and original science fiction book of all times. And there is no argue about the fact that best director in the world for filming this is Andrei Tarkovsky. But then again, maybe you can argue about that, cause some other director would probably stick more to the book. But not Tarkovsky. What he did here is maybe even better than the original, and represents one of the greatest moments in history of moving pictures. Tarkovskys "Solaris" is more poetic, philosophical, meta-physical and pure than Lems "Solaris". Every time I watch it, there is something new to find out, some new message to take, some new brilliance to see. This is as important as any literature master piece of 20th century.</fullReview>

If this happened to you, I really think you should give it another try when you're 'in the right mood'. Never have I seen a film deal with the big questions of love and life in the way that "Solaris" does. Tarkovsky doesn't give you the answers, but I found myself crying watching some of the most memorable scenes in the film. The symbolism and depth is unbelievable. This film is capable of changing or at least strengthening your views on the human race and your own life. I give it 10/10 and place it on top of my list of all time favourite films!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admit it. 9 out of 10 of you are here because you heard that this movie is better than 2001: A Space Odyssey. Or perhaps there's some jerk who keeps putting you down every time you talk about scifi because you haven't seen Solyaris. Of all the phony name-dropping that goes on in scifi, this tops the list.Well, I'm here to tell you that you don't have to sumbit. You want obscure Russian scifi that has a subtle yet poignant political/social commentary? Go see a film called KIN-DZA-DZA (1986). You want artistic science fiction which will confound your senses whilst piquing your consciousness? Go see MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH (1976). But for Chrissake, give this overrated flick a rest.But if you must... well, OK. I'll give you some pointers on how to watch (endure) this picture. Try not to get annoyed by 7 minutes of closeups of pond scum. Resist the temptation to hurl things at the screen after watching 11 minutes of freeway footage. And don't puke when you see a meaningless, 3-minute closeup of a man's ear. Yes, I'm sure these scenes are all wrought with esoteric symbolism. But that doesn't change the fact that they are overindulgent wastes of film.If, at any time during the picture, you need to get up, use the restroom or fix yourself a peanut butter sandwich, feel free to do so without hitting 'pause'. Chances are the same scene will be on the screen when you return.The plot itself is interesting but slightly flawed. But perhaps by that point you're too busy pondering the socio-political significance of a man's earlobe to notice the flaws. The ending, yes, is quite memorable. So don't throw this film in the trash without fast forwarding to the ending. But then again, if you're familiar with the old Twilight Zone series, perhaps you'll be able to figure out the ending without wasting your time looking at algae.The theme--well, here I actually have something positive to say. The theme is quite compelling, thought-provoking and ponderous. I assume that's why this film has warranted such a bloated rating on IMDb. Fair enough. But for all its poetry, this movie still did not give me an enjoyable experience. It was like listening to a very intelligent person speak in monotone, repeating himself ad nauseum. After a while, you just have to say, "Brevity is the soul of wit, my friend. And you? You're just a long-winded bore."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this and did not fall for it. Here is my comment I posted at NETFLIX. I think you will see that it is nothing but pretentious yakking.8/21/10 @ 10:08 PMI did not find this movie to be "painterly" or "deep" as others have described it. First of all, my major dislike of this movie is that _no_ science is done. Science is about answers, philosophy is about questions. So in a real scifi, there would be information gained through interaction. Instead the characters stand around - with an alien in their midst - and discuss 'what is happiness'. Did you see "Contact" with Jody Foster? When she arrives she has a thousand questions. The reply makes sense. Now that's how it's done. This? "If you are happy you never ask about the meaning of life." WHAT?? WHO CARES! A freakin' alien life form is standing in front of you and all these guys can do is get pensive??? So OK, here's the REALITY about this movie - it's typical Russian over self-indulgent mental gymnastics. Don't waste your time. You will learn nothing from this drawn out psycho-babble philosophy paper. See The Seventh Seal for a much better film. (Now I have to go see the modern American version of this.)-- Edit: (before any one flames me for not knowing what I am talking about) I have been a professional photographer, I have a Masters in physics, and a Bachelors in philosophy (Heidegger was my interest: Dasein, there where being manifests itself, and Husserl's Phenomenology - reducing the experience to its essence) and even studied jazz dance, modern dance, and ballet. (Currently I have returned to school for a degree in Anthropology with a concentration in Archaeology.) So please, I have a very broad taste, and information base, for all things art.-LD____________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really sci-fi, but the ideas and themes run much deeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really likes how it draws the viewer in with its promise of sci-fi spectacle and ideas, but then shifts gears and becomes something else entirely. I'd argue that it's not really science fiction at all, it just uses it as a base for its larger purpose. At its heart, it's really a psychological drama, and though I usually prefer sci-fi, I really dug the ideas and themes it got going through its human relationship. I read that Tarkovsky didn't like 2001 because it was cold and distant, and so set out to make this film differently, but I didn't really view it as the 'anti-2001'. It's an entirely different type of beast entirely.It's a film first and foremost about memory, and in that regard it's a lot more similar to something like La Jete in the sci-fi realm. From the opening scenes where Kris is gazing sadly into a pond, the film is almost completely concerned with the effects that lost loves and past memories have upon us. When Kris first encounters his deceased wife in the space station, he doesn't know how to deal with it at first, and he sends her away in a rocket. When he encounters her again, he becomes afraid to lose her again, and thus when she risks death to be near him (by busting through a door), he vows not to leave her side again, foregoing his mission to stay with her. It's almost as if he falls in love again, and it's interesting to see it happen.Even more intriguing, though, is the actual character of the wife, Hari. Though she is nothing more than a manifestation of Kris' thoughts at first (she can not even exist without him there, as evidenced by her door-busting antics), the way she evolves into a real human being by the end of the film is probably the most interesting part of this film. It brings up all these ideas of what it means to be human and where our memories come from, and this, in my opinion, is a lot more compelling than Kris' story. When Hari, the manifestation, eventually decides to commit suicide by drinking liquid oxygen (only to return to life, moments later, in a terrifying and disturbing sequence), it conjures up even more questions. Is the manifestation doomed to follow the path of the original, who also died by her hand? Perhaps no shot is as provocative as the final one, though. Just as we've thought that Kris has returned home to reconcile with his father, the camera pulls back to reveal that he is, in fact, on one of the island that has formed on the surface of Solaris' ocean. So many questions abound. Does Kris know he's on Solaris? Why is he there? Is he, really, or is the planet manifesting him as well? It's one of the more baffling and affecting final shots in cinema (right up there with 2001 and Planet of the Apes, as far as sci-fi goes), and it just feels like the perfect ending. The film ends where it began, at Kris' father's home, but it's not the same place at all. The journey of the story is at once linear and circular.I don't feel like I got everything on just one viewing, so I'll definitely be watching it again. It certainly doesn't feel like a masterpiece - certain scenes feel strange and out-of-place - but when viewed as a whole, I don't know what else you can call it. It's one of the greatest films I've seen, let alone in sci-fi, and I truly look forward to visiting it again someday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hauntingly beautiful and complex science fiction story, a unique masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what an experience my wife and I had tonight seeing "Solaris", based on a novel by one of my favorite science fiction writers, Stanislaw Lem. As we knew from reviews we had seen, it is a very long film at 165 minutes with many drawn-out but compelling scenes. Though it's a classic and has much to recommend it highly, I must admit that the first half I found a bit difficult to sit through - having just had a nice pasta dinner and some chocolate didn't help :-). It is such a complex film that it probably takes at least two or three viewings to feel that one has understood much of it.The basic story is that a Russian spaceship in orbit around a planet has been sending back confusing status, and Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) is sent to investigate. He finds out that the crew has been experimenting with sending pulses of radiation into the planet's vast ocean and are in turn manipulated by some sort of innate intelligence on the planet. "Guests" materialize on the ship, crafted from mental elements of the crews' minds.The first night there, Kris himself wakes up to find his long-dead love Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk) by his side. The other two crew mates, scientists Dr. Snaut (Jri Jrvet) and Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) puncture any misconceptions that Kris may have by clarifying that "she" is not real, and invite Kris to try looking at a blood sample, which clearly is not human ("she" does "bleed" when hurt, but the "blood" can be easily wiped away). The scientists in fact want to experiment on sending an annihilation sacrificial pulse of radiation to the ocean below, and imply, it seems, an interest in using Hari for that purpose.The film is unlike anything that I have seen before, and begs many philosophic questions about the nature of reality and existence, the meaning of love, time and timelessness, and much more. The sterile and very unnatural milieu of the spaceship, as well as the melancholic and minimalistic music and sound effects, make one despair for being in nature, and reflect on the early lakeside scenes. The ending (no spoilers here!) leaves room for interpretation and even understanding of just what happened. Hauntingly amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know I don't like it I feel like something missingUnhappy with Kubrick's 2001, celebrated Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky concocted his own sci-fi think piece, Solyaris. Involving an alien intelligence that is able to read minds and project (physically?) the thoughts of those who are visiting the planet on which it resides, Solyaris is deep, long (and I mean long), and devilishly confusing (and more reminiscent of THX 1138 than 2001). Primarily seen through the eyes of one scientist who finds his long- deceased wife suddenly alive on Solaryis's planet, if one Kubrick work comes to mind it's actually The Shining. (In later years, the appallingly bad Sphere is an obvious take-off on this film, only the alien is underwater instead of in space.) Occasionally brilliant, Solyaris speaks to the depth of meaning in men's souls. Some of its visuals are incredible, though many are dull, and at nearly three hours in length, there's too much fodder to make the movie even approaching of a masterpiece (Tarkovsky has stated this is his least favorite film, too). But most to the point: Did I understand it? No. Is it nonetheless a must-see of any sci-fi obsessive? Absolutely. Never mind the subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solaris is like medicine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "Solaris" for entertainment and fun is like drinking medicine and thinking you'll enjoy it as ice-cream. This is the second movie of Tarkovsky I've seen, and I think his films are slow intentionally, to leave time for you to think throughout the movie. This is not an action movie, people... What I love about Tarkovsky's movies is that while they carry an idea, you still have a lot to think about besides that idea. I am thinking about the idea of darkness/light: driving down the long tunnel with occasional short breakouts of daylight and darkness/daylight while on the Solaris. Human mind is full of darkness (mystery, uncertainty). "Guests" arrive during the night time because they are the parts of the dark side of human mind. Note that most dialogues and events happen during the night time. Of course, this may not be the central idea of the movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and claustrophobic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fine, fine film. Beautiful camera work and stark acting are the hallmarks of Russian cinema though nowhere is this formula used to such effect as it is here. Lingering, haunting scenes evoke powerfully the stuff of memories, contrasting with sudden and frightening shots of the surreal events that occur onboard the space station. It certainly isn't an easy film to watch: you'll need persistence to understand what is happening and something lighter afterwards to cut through the claustrophobic atmosphere that is left at the ending. Rarely is a film so affecting and so rewarding and the current fashion for movies with a 'twist' at the end finds a prototype here in what must be one of the most moving examples of an unexpected conclusion in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cosmonaut of the mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Step the second in my voyage through Tarkovsky.Film as we generally know it, on its lower level, or outer if you will, works upon catharsis. It induces a thirst in the soul, for justice or love, then quenches it by the end. We understand that if we go without water we will be doubly sated by a drink of it. In this mode of film we are mere vessels or instruments whereby a sin is conveyed, so we can live through the redemption that eludes us in life. This is the realm of emotion, and great cinema for me must envision beyond.All great films, the truly important ones, must enter the mind, where emotion is generated. Most of them do in one form or another. They need to be where our perception of reality is formed, not merely show us images that describe it but the mechanisms that control the images.The few truly gifted artists will then depart the mind, with wisdom and insight. One of these wisdoms is that, having understood structure, they can become the architects of thought so we can see in turn. Godard and Bergman never made it. Antonioni then is perhaps the greatest filmmaker to have lived because he moved his cinema outside both perception and non-perception, observed how these qualities (ego, feeling, desire) cease and change, and emerged mindfully from this attainment. He had, essentially, attained nirvana.Solyaris is Tarkovsky's turn as the cosmonaut who will enter for us what is beyond perception. Having left the worldly prison behind by tunnels spiraling out of it, he makes the film by which we will enter the place where the formations of life begin. Here we can begin to meditate, actually meditate.This is preceded by a marvellous scene where as an audience watching a film, we are watching an audience watching a film where another audience is watching one. Watching Tarkovsky, in fact. One of the characters deep in this film-within turns to ask, "why did you film clouds?".Then we can be rocketed into the mind, where swirling formations that defy our understanding beckon at us with elusive, eloquent mystery, where the price exacted is precisely to be lost in them.Now we are where the objects of desire manifest, the images of memory. The device that permits the inner descent, a journey outside into space, is one of the most intelligent in film and I had to hold my breath a little as it happened. The duality of microcosm and macrocosm is thus shattered, shown to mean one thing. By comparison, Kubrick (a pupil of Antonioni, who was taught but learned little) was merely windowdressing in 2001.I read a lot of complaints that the film is lifeless, but it is valuable for me that it is. We cannot meditate when wracked by impulse and emotion. The filmmaker here abets our stillness of mind, our concentrated silence.The film's biggest handicap and perhaps genius, is that having entered this dimension where consciousness is infinite, with the capacity to have our yearning for a love that died be satisfied so that we may face the same inscrutable dilemmas all over again, which is the function of memory, Tarkovsky seems uncertain what these visions ought to mean. Whether or not this memory ought to be cherished and held on to, whether the real world should be abandoned so that we can live more meaningfully among these chimeras of the mind and are they really chimeras or not. And whether this love is in fact a suffering which ought to be abided, accepted as inherent in life.This is a terrifying insinuation, that we should be trapped there. Thankfully Tarkovsky emerges from it, but I wish he was a braver artist, willing to embrace the nothingness he encountered. As with Rublev hearing the voice of god in the ringing bell, the protagonist here is set free of another's accord. The choice mercifully made from him, he can be redeemed. Or can he? The shot that closes this is one of the most poignant resolutions I've encountered in my travels through cinema, where the son having offered his penitence to receive forgiveness and love, we zoom out to see where he really stands. How, one desire that trapped the soul vanished, it has been substituted by another, one for fatherly forgiveness.Meaning there are barriers to this awareness, but Tarkovsky recognizes them in part. We see in Solyaris how the past qualities that we understand as the self change, what in Buddhist thought is understood as the transience of inter-dependent creations. How these qualities, having been, come into play again. What we don't see is how these qualities, not having been, come into play. And how, having been, they vanish again. This step backwards I will be looking for in Zerkalo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You mean more to me than any scientific truth."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One line could not sum up a film like Solaris, certainly not even one of the quotes from the characters who sometimes dip into the philosophical. But that line does still speak to me after now having seen the film twice, and still feeling as if I haven't really SEEN it altogether. Or at least maybe felt, or taken in. Andrei Tarkovsky considered this his least favorite film, and perhaps as a filmmaker myself I could understand. With a pace that never once breaks from the consistency of its focus on the differences between Nature and Earth and technology and science, as well as love, loss, memory, etc, it can be tricky for the director not to find something to critique of himself. And as it was, according to an interview on the DVD, Tarkovsky was obsessed with his work to the point of perfectionism. But, as has been put forward more times than need be to count from reading reviews and comments, this is the Russian equivalent of Kubrick's 2001 really only on two fronts, the pushing forward of boundaries in experiencing visions of what can truly never be known, and letting its characters find out what it means to be without Earth so far out in space (and equally what can stick around).But Tarkovsky is not interested in the same obsessions that had Kubrick and Clarke, and so the comparisons can only go so far before it's really just time to take the film on its own terms, or at least in relation to other science fiction films. It's not about true discovery into the unknown and reaching for mysteries rooted in us as apes. The discoveries of Solaris are known pretty well to anyone who's lived and loved and lost and not been able to connect once lost. The character of Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis, one of the two really stirring performances of the film) starts off on Earth surrounded by natures plenty, and as a mostly stone-faced widower its almost until halfway through the film that we finally see what can be tapped into in his empirically based mind. The exposition- handled through a testimony of a scarred spaceman- tells of an Ocean, being studied by the Solarists, that has started to have a life-force of its own, creating what may or may not be there for those close to it. When Kelvin arrives at the Solaris station, around two weary and worn scientists for the cause, he gets the effect of a resurrected person- his deceased wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk, the other one)- who's own ambiguities and connections as real or copy start to bring the real psychological panic to the film.All of this is done in such a way that is easy to assume as boring. But if you give yourself to the style of the film, stay with the pacing, it is rewarding on its own level, perhaps too in its way comparable to 2001, as it leaves enough to interpret. Tarkovsky is not after anything conventional, which can be seen as a draw back for some. Solaris asks its viewer to take a more emotional journey than one that might find a little creature or lots of real 'action'. Kelvin's time with his new Hari is contrasted against the near empty space station, as he has formed out his wife from somewhere inside of him. In fact it's probably so much connected with philosophical overtones- with at least some time given to talking about the whats and whys of really seeking out something outside of Earth that can only be understood in logic beyond simplicity. At the same time a love story is also worked in, or rather a love constricted within boundaries of perception and the surreal. Why can't Hari be killed or disappear? What happens when Kelvin has his fever late in the film? And can Hari ever really feel at peace with him? What's love when reflected upon? The questions raised, which may or may not be answered by the end of the film (though it had an ending that had me saying out loud "oh wow", in part surprise and in part seeing how the factor of the 'Guests' made perfect sense), are put to a backdrop of something that can really be described as something of great art. It might leave little parts that are imperfect, but overall like some big epic poem Tarkovsky's film sinks deep into its subject matter that for those who can grasp enough of it in one or two viewings can take that in tow with the style. And, as mentioned before, at almost three hours it carries as much weight on the side of capturing the visuals as it does of expressing the characters. There's a beauty to nature, and it's seen with just as clear and undiscriminating an eye as the long scene on the road driving (my personal favorite), the oceans in space, and the corridors of the ship are seen as enclosing and impersonal. Some of these images on their own had me re-watching them on their own, just to see how he and his crew did it. It's got that desire to raise questions that marks the most interesting science fiction, in this case to terrify us by the nature of the people affected by realized abstractions, and to conjure some thought as to what's in us as much as what might be out there. An extraordinary movie that is, to be expected, going to draw its audience as take it or leave it. If you do take it, it marks as one of those movies that asks for your patience and then delivers as much once its over as it did when it was on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film Which Produces Cinema's Greatest Payoff Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, do not...I repeat...do not try to impress your precious male and lady friends by putting this movie into your VHS or DVD players. They will be fast fumbling for the car keys. This is a film to be sensed alone as you contemplate your existence in this world. For maximum effect, I recommend viewing this in the wee hours of the night or during a dark rainy day. If you've never heard of Tarkovsky, this film is a good place to start to understand and experience/enjoy the genius behind this filmmaker/philosopher. Tarkovsky, like Bergman, makes films which are extremely difficult to comprehend especially if you view them only once. This shouldn't alienate serious moviegoers as they will eventually need films by these artists to keep their passion for cinema alive. One can't survive on a diet of 'Titanic' for too long.'Solaris' has, in my opinion, cinema's greatest payoff scene. The movie chugs along for 160 minutes (I admit, it is a burdensome length and will test anybody's patience) which seems endless but this mirrors our own existence in that our lives are filled with moments of excitement and passion spread out by periods of long, seemingly endless span where we can't rationalize the present and long for those beautiful moments of the past. As we are coming to grips with this struggle...through the endless span of time...all of a sudden...the revelation. We journey with the protagonist through his joy, pain, and despair through his life...all building up to that final astonishing scene. I was literally jolted out of my seat as chills ran through my spine as I witnessed one of the most quietly horrifying and disturbing scenes in the history of cinema. The 'shock' was magnified because of the possibility that the same fate could be dealt to me and eventually to all of us. This scene is one of the five best scenes ever captured on celluloid. The fact that this Russian director was able to pull off something like this is a testament to his deep love and devotion to films and his incisive sensibility of the world in which he lived in. I am sad that he is no longer with us in this life but his works will forever capture the essence of the man. After viewing 'Solaris', why stop there? Why not move on to 'Stalker', 'Mirror', 'Nostalghia' and so forth?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filled with unforgettable images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Armed with scientific curiosity, a desire for adventure, and a chauvinistic desire to spread its power to other realms, mankind has always dreamed about traveling to outer space. What is ironic is, as the film Solaris suggests, the journey may only bring us closer to confronting inner space: our fears, regrets, feelings of guilt, and issues of conscience. Based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem, Solaris has been filmed twice: once by the great Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972 and recently by Steven Soderbergh in a much more condensed version, though the idea can be traced to the 1962 film, Journey to the Seventh Planet. The three-hour plus Tarkovsky version takes place almost entirely within the claustrophobic confines of a space ship but the philosophical space is vast. Tarkovsky's film is exceedingly slow-paced with his trademark long takes, static compositions, and mood of solemnity, yet it contains haunting images of cinematic poetry.Set at an undisclosed time in the future, the film opens with psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) gazing at a lovely image of underwater reeds rising and falling in cadence. He then visits his estranged father in his countryside home in a fifteen minute sequence that is not present in Lem's novel, but crucial to the film's conclusion. When Burton, a friend of his father, warns Kris of strange happenings on the space station surrounding the oceanic planet Solaris, Kris is sent to investigate. After an extended highway montage of Burton's car ride home that perhaps suggests a road going nowhere, Kris arrives at the space station to find that one of the crew has committed suicide, and the others talking about ghost-like apparitions that resemble dead loved ones. He gradually discovers that the planet they are circling is a living entity, producing exact copies of people extracted from the crew's memory. One of the "guests" is Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), Kris' wife who took her own life. Though able to regenerate herself after being sent on a rocket into space, she slowly begins to take on human characteristics and Kris becomes as attached to her as to the memory of his wife. The character of the psychologist is much less emotional than in the Soderbergh version and the lack of flashbacks makes it difficult to fully appreciate the trauma of Kris' recent past. In a gorgeous scene, Hari discovers a painting by Pieter Bruegel of a village in winter that helps her get in touch with snowy scenes from Kris' childhood, enhancing her development toward being human. As the alien Hari realizes, however, that she can never become the real Hari, she separates herself physically and emotionally from Kris, suggesting that the created memory of the past is more real than the reality of the present. While Tarkovsky's film is plagued with poor editing and other technical difficulties and struggles to amass any cumulative power, it is filled with unforgettable images that remain indelible and a philosophical depth that demands repeat viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best 'realistic' films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read the book. I've seen this movie so many times and it is still one of the most fascinating movies ever shot on this planet. This has to do with my preference to watch movies that are very close to reality. No noise in space like in the Star Wars movies. No unnatural cuts that tries to 'speed up' this film. Of course, this takes patience and some of the comments I've read about this movie are mentioning how 'slow' this movie is. Well, reality is not exactly fast moving. Just going from A to B takes time. So, the sequence showing the world outside a car windshield is just right. And the nature scenes are awesome and makes you hungry to see more of nature's wonders. The music is to die for, the classical opening from Bach opens your mind to a different world. The story is complex and you need to pay attention. I bought recently the original Russian version with subtitles to get a better feeling how the language sounds in its original. It is all fantastic good. The German translation I like best, maybe because that is my mother language. In my opinion, the only other film that seems a little ahead of this movie is 2001: A Space Odyssee. But this is another story. Juergen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whenever we show pity, we empty our souls.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solaris (1972) Runtime: 168 minutes Genre: Drama, Mystery, Sci-FiWhenever we show pity, we empty our souls.What exactly is the thing that makes us all humans? Soul! Mind! Sense! Or perhaps, the ability to judge from right to wrong, now then, when it comes to soul we all know what it is capable of, whereas the mind can only tell us the definition of the right thing and the wrong thing "in this case, the right deed and the wrong one" now the ability to judge between the right and the wrong plays a phenomenal part by delivering the message to the one and only sense to choose what's right and what's wrong.Did Kris make the right choice? He created a life-form out of his memories and then he made attachments with it and in the end it was all for nothing. Some may say he did what he had to and some may say that was the right choice but in my opinion he didn't choose anything it was Solaris that chose to bring back Hari and Kris was a mere puppet in the play.Solaris is by far the most beautiful, sensible and touching love story I have ever watched. Exceptional job done by Andrei Tarkovsky, screenplay and the direction as he has never failed to impress, though some of his trademarks were missing from the frame, didn't get to see much of his long takes and dipping water sounds and close-ups of debris moreover I was hoping to see more of Mr. Arseniy Tarkovsky's pleasant poetry and heartwarming quotes but Solaris is more of a self-explanatory picture than words (like a talking photograph) whereas Stalker (1979) and Zerkalo (1975) are vice versa.To me Tarkovsky's idea of a perfect movie completely differs than the thoughts of a perfectionist, Tarkovsky has never used the same idea again in his work. Stalker was about hope (true or false your choice) Zerkalo was about life and Solaris is about choices.For sensible audience this movie has to be the best movie ever made and if anyone finds this movie boring or to slow-paced, tedious then I guess they can never understand what art-cinema is all about.PS: The only reason why I didn't give any Stanislaw Lem's reference is because after completion Lem thought that Tarkovsky didn't do a good job matter fact Lem thought that Tarkovsky has blown his novels whole idea.Two thumbs up "A solid 10/10"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind-bending masterpiece of dreams and delusions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While in the West Stanley Kubrick's 2001 (1968) remains the thinking man's preferred alien movie, it would be unfortunate to overlook Russia's stunning answer to 2001. Solaris, directed by Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, was released in 1972 and remains a unique, emotionally powerful film.The story revolves around psychologist Kris Kelvin, played by Donatas Banionis, who is sent to a space station orbiting the alien planet of Solaris to determine whether the station should be shut down. When he arrives, he finds not only the resident scientists Snaut (Yuri Yarvet) and Sartorius (Anatoly Solonitsyn), but also someone or something else. This mysterious being appears in the form of Kelvin's dead wife Hari, played by Natalya Bondarchuk. This entity is not really Hari but rather a creation of the living Solaris Ocean. Nevertheless, Kelvin is captivated with Hari and is soon consumed by his grief and misery fuelled by Solaris.Solaris surely won't appeal to anyone wanting a loud, gory action-adventure movie. Tarkovsky's film is slow, thoughtful and 166 minutes long. In spite of its length, seeing it multiple times is rewarding. According to the booklet accompanying the Criterion Collection's Blu-ray edition of Solaris, Tarkovsky felt 2001 was too "cold and sterile." From this viewpoint Solaris is the better film, because it deals more directly with human emotions while maintaining the momentous theme of contact with an alien intelligence. In the Criterion booklet, critic Phillip Lopate argues the contact is even more profound than that. The film suggests a presence of God.As for the look of the film, on Blu-ray it does not have the eye-popping sharpness and colour of more recent American films. Still, the backgrounds are solid and the film looks generally clean. I don't really know why some people complain about the special effects; the Solaris Ocean looks very cloudy and murky, and what's wrong with that? This is my favourite film by Tarkovsky, and I almost wish there was more, a sequel allowing the viewer to return to Solaris in the same way 2001 has 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can we understand the universe if we don't know ourselves?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Russian "Solaris" presents an ultra slow, meditative take on space exploration and human nature. Although not as gripping, atmospheric and visually impressive as "Stalker", "Solaris" deals with alienation in a typical Tarkovsky fashion. Other themes include the ethics of science, virtual reality, identity, inter-species communication, and the inherent human limitations and paradoxes.Stanislaw Lem once said that our ability to adapt, and therefore to accept everything was one of our greatest dangers. But is our destiny something that we accept or do we fight against it? How far do we go and to what result? Is there such thing as "destiny" in the first place? What choices do we have and what do we choose when given a second chance? The film raises more questions than it answers, and that's a hallmark of good science fiction.More personal and self-admittedly lacking the scope and grandeur of the other "proverbially good sci-fi movie", '2001- A Space Odyssey', 'Solaris' is actually opposing Kubrik's film - in tone, message and style. What they share is only a philosophical dimension that finally redeemed the sci-fi genre, showing it for what it is: an evaluation of the human condition. Devoid of special effects (except a few representations of the alien ocean), Solaris focuses on psychology.One major impediment for the viewer is probably the length of the movie. It is clear that the loneliness, isolation and despair surrounding the characters requires such an approach, but I didn't find 'Solaris' to be overall as engaging and intriguing as other lengthy movies of the same director. My first impression was that the space station looked like an old TV studio and Donatas Banionis didn't seem particularly good for this role (Natalya Bondarchuk however, gives an impressive performance). Despite these issues, Solaris was still a rewarding experience. If there was ever an argument against space exploration, this must be the most convincing one. The human psyche is a dark and still uncharted universe, more enigmatic and dangerous than the infinite outer space.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version - the original -of SOLARIS, is one of the closest films that feels like a dream, that I've seen.I understand that Mr. Lem was not happy with EITHER version made, but, taken as just a film, this version is head &amp; shoulders above the much more 'obvious' Soderbergh imitation.Those who did not like SOLARIS all were expecting a 'Hollywood-like' production - whining about the 'slowness,' complaints about the film's stock 'quality,' 'cheap production,''pretentious' (NO, it's you didn't get it!), and, on, and, .....Saying that, if you are someone who is expecting typical scifi garbage, DO NOT VIEW SOLARIS!On the other side, if you read the reviews of people who LOVE SOLARIS (and, there is a VERY clear dividing line between the two), the comments, the questions that are posed about SOLARIS, is exactly what SOLARIS SHOULD (and does) do. In a very simple, but, ultimately unanswerable question, SOLARIS asks us 'why.'How you, the viewer interpret that question, is part of the beauty of SOLARIS. It is so enigmatic, that another theme I noticed in other reviews, was how many people were 'haunted' by the film - particularly, it's last shot.SOLARIS clocks in at close to 3 hours. It is NOT a 'Hollywood' film by ANY standard. It builds slow. It requires the viewer to pay attention - to put the parts together, to understand what's happening. It asks - NOT answers - questions.In a nutshell: a space station, orbiting above a distant water planet (Solaris) has had reports of 'strange' occurrences. Due to the time required to travel to Solaris (years) all communication is very slow. Kris Kelvin is going to follow up on the reports, that, somehow, Solaris itself is SOMEHOW the 'reason,' and, causing these strange occurrences.Kris ventures to Solaris, and finds the space station void of practically everyone, and in a straight of disuse - like an apartment not kept clean.He encounters one of the crew; Dr. Snaut, who tries to explain what's been happening, but, in an almost joking manner about the whole situation.Things become more dram-like, after Kris encounters his (late) wife, Hari.He's pulled further into this dream - or is it?That's as much as I'll tell, to avoid giving too much away.If you like films, and, you want to be challenged - have to think - rather than have the film(maker) tell you what to think, I highly recommend SOLARIS.SOLARIS was called at the time 'the Soviet answer to 2001: A Space Odyssey.' IT is NOT - in ANY way, and, if you unfortunately try to compare SOLARIS to it, or any other film, you WILL be disappointed.Ultimately, SOLARIS is a triumph for Tarkovsky, and his willingness to not pander to the audience, as almost all Hollywood films do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewers familiar with the pace and texture of a typical Andrei Tarkovsky film might think the last thing we need is an even longer Tarkovsky feature. But the uncut version of this already dense, metaphysical sci-fi parable (drastically cut by its first American distributor in the early 1970s) at least restores some narrative clarity (if no actual answers) to the Stanislaw Lem story of a sentient ocean planet and its unnerving effect on the crew of an orbiting space station. It's ironic that Tarkovsky's most popular feature was the director's least favorite of his own films. Outer space clearly held less interest to him than the mysteries of inner space, but his attempt to work in such a well-worn (and for this filmmaker, totally unlikely) genre resulted in a challenging speculative fiction light years away from the hardware and hustle of a George Lucas adventure, probing the cosmos with deeper insight than even Stanley Kubricks '2001', and with a surprising economy of distracting effects. Like every other Tarkovsky film it can be ponderous, enigmatic, intellectually fascinating, visually stunning, and incredibly slow: not exactly easy entertainment, but if patience is a virtue here's the reward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solaris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not realise that the George Clooney film was a remake, nor that this original featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I watched this version first, from director Andrei Tarkovsky (Mirror). Basically Solaris is a space mission with a base established on a planet that hosts a kind of intelligence, but the details are secret. The last scientist to be stationed in the base had weird visions and has disappeared into the Solaris Ocean, and helicopter pilot Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky) searched for him. It is believed the scientist was suffering hallucinations, and the Solaris commission need a man to find out the state of the three remaining men on the station in space. This job is assigned to widowed psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), and there he meets Dr. Snaut (Jri Jrvet) who tells him that a friend among the scientists Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan) mysteriously died, well, it was suicide. A little later, Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) confirms with Kris that the remaining scientists also have strange behaviours, and he is soon to join them. Kris's wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk) died ten years ago after committing suicide, and all of the sudden he is appearing to be seeing and interacting with her. The scientists explain to Kris that the Solaris Ocean has the ability to materialise inner thoughts for someone into a realistic style being. Kris questions whether the appearance of his wife is real or not, but also whether it is a good thing or a bad thing. After many weird happenings, Kris finds himself back at home on Earth with his Father (Nikolai Grinko) at the old house, and when the camera zooms out we see that it is on a small island in the middle of the Solaris Ocean. I will be honest and say that because it was in Russian it was hard to keep up with what was going on, but at the same time it is probably all not meant to make sense. It was certainly more chatty than filled with special effects, and when there were effects it had a 2001: A Space Odyssey feel about it, I just enjoyed the hypnotic strangeness, it makes it an influential science-fiction drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergei Tarkovsky's Solyaris is one of my all-time favorite science fiction films, but it is not for everybody. Based on a novel by brilliant Polish-Soviet Imaginative Fiction author Stanislaw Lem, Solyaris is an intensely philosophical sojourn into inner and outer space. It is also a lengthy, beautiful and very eastern European film. Solaris capture the stoic and sometime nihilistic imagination of Lem, but very little of his quirky sense of humor. Instead, the film is an intense, brooding examination of the conflict and dualism of the human urge to explore and possess the limits of knowledge and being.Kris Kelvin (Donatus Banionus) is a psychologist who is sent to the research station in orbit around the planet Solaris to prepare its crew for the station's shut down. Solaris, however, is not just a planet, but rather a living, evolving neural net, and the mission of the various scientists (Solarists) who have been studying it for decades is to understand and make contact. The earth-side administration for this project has become frustrated with the fact that the Solarists do not seem to be able to force a 'breakthrough', but it seems that Solaris itself has been reaching out in its own way. The story focuses on Kelvin's metamorphosis, but this is really just a vehicle for Lem's multitude of philosophical points. While intellectually brilliant, the film could not approach the philosophical scope of Lem's lucid but dense writing. Those who want to explore his ideas on extraterrestrial intelligence, the human condition, progress, etc, should read the book - after seeing the movie(s).The cinematography is absolutely superb. Each shot is a work of art. The acting is very good and very consistent - none of the actors falter and Natalya Bondarchuk (Hari) and Juri Jarvet (Dr. Snaut) are particularly mesmerizing. The pace may be a bit difficult - particularly for American audiences - but don't even start with this film if you are not willing to invest in it - it's not an easy film and it is well worth expending a bit of patience. Since this IS Sci Fi, I feel obligated to mention the special effects. They are appropriate to the subject matter - never overdone, and certainly not the focus of the film. Stephen Soderbergh's Americanized version of Solyaris http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0307479/usercomments is one of the few Americanizations of a foreign film which does justice to the original, but still, Tarkovsky's film is the better of the two. What Soderbergh did particularly well was to translate Solaris from Soviet/Eastern European to American cultural contexts. This involved dialog changes, characterization and a few subtle plot changes. Although both films focus heavily on the central male character, Soderbergh's film proportionally spends more time with Clooney to the detriment of his fellow Solarists. Perhaps the most noticeable plot change is the fact that Tarkovsky's film explains itself fairly early on as the scientists discuss the nature of the phenomena Solaris appears to cause, while in Soderbergh's film, the mysteries are retained for a bit longer. Finally, Tarkovsky's film is a work of art, and although Soderbergh's technique is very good, Tarkovsky's cinematography is unusually powerful. Every scene is picture-perfect. Both films are highly recommended, but only for patient and thoughtful Sci Fi and drama fans. If you're not sure, you may want to try Soderbergh's version first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's first sci-fi/drama is one of the best (Continental) European films ever made. I know, I know, that isn't saying much, considering how much garbage has come from the Old Continent? "Solaris", based on Lem's novel, is an intellectual affair ? but I mean that in a positive way. It isn't pretentious, but simply very intelligent. The dialog is fascinating, and the story very interesting. The photography is excellent, the movie having a sort of mood all its own. Quite long, but never boring. This is the kind of intelligent, unique movie Bergman would have done ? if he had only been capable of it. If you liked this, you will probably also enjoy Boorman's "Zardoz" and Tarkovsky's other sci-fi drama, "Stalker". What you shouldn't do is watch Soderbergh's recent, truly awful George Clooney remake. It ranks as one of the worst sci-fis ever made. (Well, anything with Clooney is likely to be bad, and Soderbergh is a pretty reliable deliverer of garbage, as well.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's greatest masterpiece cannot be commented without comparing it to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. They're very alike in some ways. If you can't concentrate on 2001, you probably can't make it here, and likewise. Tarkovsky's movies have long sequences with not really anything going on in them, and often when there's something going on, you may not have a clue what it is.I believe fans of Tarkovsky will definitely love this one. Compared to, let's say Stalker, this may be easier to watch and a better one to start with, if you're interested in Tarkovsky's films. All the films he's directed has all these weird scenes with no actual meaning, but you're not able to get them out of your head. But what ever you do, never try to watch a Tarkovsky, if you're tired or cannot be fully concentrated on it.Solyaris may be the greatest science fiction film ever made. It's remade by Steven Sodenberg, but you can never achieve the same Tarkovsky did. The movie is based on Stanislaw Lem's Solaris. But the movie can be watched also as a series of beautiful images and fascinating cinematography, but it has pretty much more going on, that everybody may not understand the same way.I think the film has some same themes as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, which is a great science fiction movie too, in more traditional way than Solyaris. The movie makes you think and it doesn't leave you alone in some while after you've seen it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarkovsky was a master at his art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frequently, this has been called, `Russia's answer to 2001.' A comparison that I was originally confused by because it points to the fact that these two films are somewhat alike. As of now, that statement couldn't be more true. This is the third time in a row that I've been completely mesmerized by a Tarkovsky film. The first was `Stalker', the second `Nostalghia', and now the most ambitious of the three has taken me by complete surprise as a result of its complexity. It's also very hard to describe this piece of science fiction without giving too much away. It's a sci-fi romance/mystery/philosophical journey all rolled into one. It's a romance, yet, it isn't really a romance at all; more of an `artificial' romance. If that doesn't sound strange enough, watch the film. Both Solaris and 2001: a space odyssey share one thing aside from their science fiction roots; they explore mankind in a psychological way.2001 expresses its point visually, taking us on a trip without explaining much. Solaris, at times is very talky, which takes it into a much different direction than the aforementioned film. It leaves much more to the imagination than you might expect. Yes, there are shots of the planet itself, but the conflicts and mystery play out mostly in your head. I like how Tarkovsky is able to make you believe something is happening, when it isn't physically happening. This is a big plus, and makes it all the more remarkable, because you can tell this was done on a small budget, but makes the best of it. Like 2001, it sets up a mystery, past its lengthy exposition, regarding the planet Solaris. The mystery is setup but never solved, and we are still wondering, `what is it?' But that is not the only mystery that drives the film; the other involves the main character, Chris Kelvin, and how he struggles to understand himself, and his love for the woman he lost many years before. And who has been resurrected by some power or ability the planet posesses. There is a great irony in this. Kelvin, a psychologist, is sent to the planet Solaris to do a report on the scientists who are working on a station to see whether the project should be terminated or not. Yet, he himself is the one eventually subjected to being studied.The scientists are sent to study the planet, but the reason that they haven't, and cannot find a logical explanation to the problem laid down in front of them is that they do not understand themselves. It even occurs at one point in the film where the wisest among the scientists, Snauth, doesn't have all the answers, and he's right. Even in the end, they are still in a state of confusion, but we somehow understand that state of confusion. I don't think Stainslaw Lem, or even Tarkovsky for that matter, set out to answer questions the about humanity, but merely brought the questions and ideas forth to present them in a way that we might understand that not everything can be explained. We are limited as human beings. The final shot demonstrates that, as it pulls slowly away to reveal an image that I will never forget.Tarkovsky brings the film both hauntingly and beautifully together. Not only does he do that, but his camerawork is slow and contemplative. It baffles me how someone like him can be that patient. He was one of a kind; a visual poet, a master at bringing art to the screen, yet his filmography only spans 7 films. I read that he considered this to be the weakest of all his films, but that isn't saying much. It draws you in by your curiosity, and never releases its grip til the end. It is one of the greatest among science fiction films; complex, mindbending, beautiful, and haunting. A great film.****1/2 or (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solaris is a great movie, BUT, there are a few things you should take into consideration. First, the "slow" parts that a lot of people complain about these days are put there for a reason - try to figure out why and see if you can enjoy them. Secondly, I will admit, on first attempt, ok ok, on first and second attempt, I fell asleep, I simple watched it too late and by myself, first time on VHS, second time on DVD, the THIRD time, I got all Starbucksed up and watched it with a fellow Sci Fi fan - it was great. The bottom line is, even though I like long films that can be slow, I have been conditioned to more action these days, even in films that don't feature action. This IS relatively slow. You just have to re-set your mindset and watch it early and after a strong cup of coffee...otherwise it will make 2001 seem like Enter the Dragon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's most well-known film, Solaris is without a doubt a first-rate endeavor by one of Russia's greatest directors. Despite making only seven films in his short-lived career, Tarkovsky remains to be a master of his own craft, developing a unique visual style that employs long takes with a slow but deliberate camera-work that draws the truth out of his complex characters. In Solaris, he attempts a science-fiction film based on Stanislaw Lem's novel of the same name. And like all great films of this genre, Solaris is both provocative and philosophical.Tarkovsky's film tells the story of one man, Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), a space psychologist who is tasked to travel to a space station in Solaris (an isolated celestial body faraway in space with the potential to unlock clues to Man's existence) to investigate the mysterious happenings that have caused a few unexplained deaths to the people working there. In true sci-fi tradition, we learn that Solaris' oceans are sentient and can recreate loved ones who have passed away from the memories of those who stay there. Kris meets two delusional scientists, and discovers a video made by a dead person that forewarns him of the madness to come.Solaris' relative lack of music that accompanies the film allows Tarkovsky to fully rely on his camera to evoke suspense, unease, and emotional tension. For some odd reason, the film feels like Kubrick's The Shining (1980) in the exploration of what a place can do to someone's mind. Hallucinations occur, ghostly figures of sorts that walk about the station. They are neither specters nor are they organic. However, they keep returning even if one banishes them out to space, as Kris finds out for himself. You see, his dead wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk) returns and "haunts" him, but not for reasons that are evil.The struggle for identity and the desire to feel loved are core themes of Solaris, just as they are for Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence (2001) three decades later. When a sentient human-like creation wants to feel loved, could a real human ever be accommodating enough to offer "it" that love? Kris eventually succumbs to the prospect of infinite love with a being that could very well be a figment of his imagination, irking the scientists on board to the extent that they are considering realizing their destructive thoughts. Now who's delusional, they are entitled to ask.The Kris-Hari relationship forms the narrative core of Solaris' second-half. Particularly, Bondarchuk delivers an exacting performance that allows the injection of emotional warmth so absent in these kinds of films. In a way, Tarkovsky's film is the anti-2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), described by the Russian director as "sterile", which he saw only years after completing Solaris. Ironically, Solaris could be seen as an extension of Kubrick's sci-fi masterpiece, both thematically and visually; there are far more elements in common in both films than not.There is a very special sequence in the first-quarter of the film prior to Kris' departure to space that shows the point-of-view of a vehicle traveling along a long stretch of road with cars passing by. It is an extended long take that could be read as a metaphor ? that of an endless journey into the unknown about to be taken by Kris. Along the way, the vehicle goes into a multitude of tunnels ? perhaps a foreshadowing of the darkness to come? Solaris is beautifully photographed by Vadim Yusof (Ivan's Childhood, 1962; Andrei Rublev, 1966), and ends with a satisfying twist that provides the film with its most chilling, skin-crawling moment.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

Each frame is painted with loving care and generosity, so the whole movie is always consistently beautiful. Cinematographer Vadim Yusov's delicate compositions are among the most beautiful ever created for the silver screen.The screenplay by Fridrikh Gorenshtein and Andrei Tarkovsky (the director), based on the novel written by Stanis&#x142;aw Lem, probes all the dilemma's that the situation involves and the final, hauntingly ambiguous image of Solaris making an island for Donatas Banionis fantasies(?) is up there with Kubrick's afore mentioned masterpiece as the greatest ending ever.Of course, Andrei Tarkovsky directed this astounding film, so he should take the credit for letting the actors and all concerned do the best work they ever did. So I must say thank you to Tarkovsky for creating this awe-inspiring film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike Soderbergh's interminable and seemingly much longer take on Stanislaw Lem's novel, Tarkovsky's Solaris is a sensual film, but one where the senses aren't exactly numbed as dulled into a kind of half-dreamlike state. Like the reeds in the opening shot, you have to go with the ebb and flow - it's almost more of a feeling than a film. And, it has to be said, at times that feeling can be like being lulled to the verge of sleep, while at others it's like being caught up in a fever. It's tempting to wonder what Werner Herzog makes of the film.Lem famously disliked the film with a passion, feeling it gave into the heart rather the head with trite clichs: "Instead of focusing on deeper moral questions related to frontiers of human knowledge, he made a drama-type Crime and Punishment in space, by making up unnecessary characters of parents and relatives, then adding a hut on an island," was one of his less bitter comments after he fell out with Tarkovsky writing the script, although that implies a far more sentimental film than Tarkovsky delivered. Certainly the issue of whether the visitors are a gift, an experiment, a probe or a defensive psychological attack on the scientists is all but ignored in favour of their emotional effects on Kelvin and (to a much lesser effect) the scientists: these characters really aren't looking for answers, they're looking for a mirror, and it's their insular nature that condemns them to literally float in their own islands of memory (or a 'hut on an island' if you ascribe to Lem's view).Rather than a formulaic movie redemption tale or Lem's examination of our inability to truly comprehend a superior alien intelligence because of the biological limitations imposed on us almost as design faults, Tarkovsky's film is about the limitations we impose on ourselves regardless of how far we technically advance and our inability to rise above them. Its nominal hero, Kelvin, is not a pleasant man and the film makes little attempt to bring the audience to his side. He treats the disgraced Cosmonaut Burton with insensitivity, professes a ruthless scientific pragmatism that allows for no human element and his immediate response to his first 'guest' on the Solaris research station is to deceive and dispose of her. Yet ultimately, as much because of his emotional limitations as in spite of them, he's the one human being who acts most humanely by recognising, albeit in a totally self-centred way, that the fault lies not in the stars but in themselves. Like Burton's young son with the horse in the lengthy prologue on Earth, he displays a childlike fear and rejection of something he doesn't understand before reluctantly accepting that it may have beauty, even if it's a beauty he cannot comfortably embrace.But the most human character remains the least human: Hari, or rather his image of his dead wife Hari, unable to feel anything that he does not remember for her, stifled by his limitations and gradually assuming a painful awareness and despair of her own. Ironically, it's as she becomes more human that she becomes more unstable. To the other scientists it's because the visitors are unstable neutrino systems, but it's when the artificial Hari studying a painting - another artificial creation of man's consciousness - which triggers a real memory that the horror of her situation as a mere facsimile strikes home. To Kelvin she's at first more a penance than a second chance, a condemnation to repeat history while remaining oblivious - as he presumably did with the real Hari - to the person she is really becoming.So, not exactly a barrel of laughs, but strangely compelling if you go with it. The 165 minutes don't exactly fly by, but they certainly can get under your skin if you're in a receptive mood and it's not hard to see why it's been so influential on Hollywood sci-fi (Sphere, Event Horizon and Star Trek The Motion Picture among the most prominent).Sadly, I was shocked by just how bad the picture quality of the first hour of the Criterion DVD was compared to the PAL Russico/Artificial Eye one - aside from some grading and subtitle changes it looks like you're watching a bad standards conversion of a video tape that's been burned onto a CD-R for all of the Earth-bound sequences, although the colour is better (hence dropping two stars from the rating). If it weren't for the better extras package - including several deleted/extended scenes and detailed interviews - I doubt I'd have kept this copy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to be savoured slowly, but one that is ultimately rewarding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't know what to expect when I popped "Solaris" into my VCR. I thought perhaps the movie would be an eerie psychological thriller, as that was what the back of the box had promised. This film is somewhat different from that description; this is one of the most haunting films in recent memory, but not in the way you would expect.For me, the best part of "Solaris" was the visual texture of the film. Sure, the special effects aren't flashy (it was made in 1972, after all) but the space station on which the majority of the film takes place is so meticulously crafted that I would say that I prefer the effects over the computer generated ones of films today. I relished the tiny details, even down to the scraps of litter that were scattered around the floor of the halls.Don't get me wrong, "Solaris" really isn't about its effects. The story behind the film is a very enticing one, and--if you allow yourself to fall under it's spell--a very engrossing one. Try to find yourself 3 hours where you will have no distractions and no breaks from the film (except to change tapes, of course).I have heard comments about the film being too slow and overlong. I do think some of the early scenes in the film could have been cut slightly. For example, the (over)long tracking shot from the perspective of a car on the highway really doesn't serve much of a purpose, and could have been cut down without losing any effect.I think in the case of "Solaris", the movie benefits from moving slowly. I believe Tarkovsky did this purposely so that the viewer could savour all of the details without being rushed off to the next scene. Overall, "Solaris" is not a movie for everyone. However, if you are willing to watch it with an open mind, I think you will find that "Solaris" is a very rewarding experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"When film is not a document, it is dream. That is why Tarkovsky is the greatest of them all."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only two film directors in the world whose every movie haunts me and causes insomnia every time I watch it. One of them is A. Tarkovsky ? a true auteur and genius who made 7 films that are considered to be masterpieces (another is the author of the reviews title). Among these films brightly shines a science fiction mystery Solaris. It is a breathtaking story about a man's journey to cosmos to seek knowledge about an alien intelligence and more importantly to understand himself and the nature of the humankind. The main stars of the movie are Lithuanian D. Banionis, Estonian J. Jrvet and Russians A. Solonitsyn and N. Bondarchuk.Solaris is known for its slow and gradual prelude. Prelude lasts for 40 minutes and takes place on Earth. During it, we are introduced to the main character ? psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) who is shown as a profound person tormented by his own thoughts. He agrees to go on a mission to a base established near a planet that appears to have some kind of intelligence on it. At first Kelvin seems to be skeptical about it but his approach radically changes when he comes on the base and meets members of the crew Dr. Snaut (Juri Jarvet), Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) and Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan). They are acting very bizarre and soon Kelvin finds out the reason of this strange behavior. He realizes that the planet is able to materialize people's thoughts. Kelvin tries to understand what does the planet wants from them, what makes human a human and many others scientific, moral and philosophical problems.A. Tarkovsky's masterpiece has to be watched more than just one time because of its complex themes and problems. Solaris complexity is the reason why this movie stands out of all science fiction movies and is timeless. It tries to make viewers think about the human kind and invites to an open debate about the deepest feelings and fears of humans. Film also deals with the theme of remorse and the problem of not being capable to escape from your own thoughts. Quotes of L. Tolstoy are citied on more than one occasion and there are some references to Don Quixote written by M. Cervantes. Moreover, the whole story can be seen as an attempt of humankind to understand and to be understood by the higher intelligence (or even God if you want to name it).Another thing that makes this movie so special is its visual beauty and eerie mood. No matter where the action is taking place or if it is filmed in color of B/W it is still stunning. A. Tarkovsky manages to show the beauty of countryside (prelude), city (ride on streets of the future Moscow) and science fiction features (from the design of the base to the magnificent ocean of the planet) in the same movie. Even though the film is visually beautiful, the viewer is not always able to relax and admire it. This is because A. Tarkovsky attains so paranoid and eerie mood that it makes some parts of the movie look like scenes from a horror movie. He achieves it with the help of haunting composition of J. S. Bach ("Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ") which becomes the movie score.To sum up, Solaris is a thought provoking masterpiece that has an overwhelming visuals and a haunting score. It is not designed for a regular viewer and Tarkovsky expects a lot of wisdom from his viewer. However, I consider Solaris to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made and I believe that it should be viewed by every self-respected movie buff at least twice.2011-05-31</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solaris weaves a hypnotic fable about love, humanity, and memory out of its science fiction premise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solaris is director Andrei Tarkovsky's most famous film. It's labeled as belonging to the science fiction genre and most of it does take place on a space station, but it's more a philosophical love story. Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) knows that the Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk) he meets on the space station isn't the woman whom he loved, but in time he realizes that he loves her and can't let go of her. He even mentions that she's better than the real Hari was; probably because she was created from his memories. Solaris features very few special effects. It's not like Star Wars or even 2001: A Space Odyssey. If entertainment is all you're looking for then you probably won't enjoy the film. But it's not boring. In fact it's one of Tarkovsky's most accessible films. It's two and a half hours long, but once I got into it I couldn't stop watching it. It's like the film absorbs you.Some gorgeous images of nature are featured, and the space station's interiors look good too. The whole film seemed like a dream to me. There are details that you pick up only if you watch it more than once. The actors are good in their roles. This is a Tarkovsky film after all. The pretty Bondarchuk is a delight to see on screen. It's often said that author Stanislaw Lem didn't like Tarkovsky's film because it became different from the story in the novel. However, if Tarkovsky shot Solaris according to the novel it would not have been a great film. Its brilliance isn't in the story but in Tarkovsky's vision. Solaris is one of the greatest science fiction films. It especially influenced Russian filmmakers. The film gets a high recommendation from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 'Solaris' from director Andrei Tarkovsky is almost twice as long as the 2002 remake from Steven Soderbergh, which is a good thing for the movie but a bad thing for most audiences. If you have seen the remake and found it too slow, too boring, then you must not watch the original. I didn't find the movie boring, although I have to admit there are scenes that seem to go on forever, one with a freeway in particular.The story is about a planet named Solaris and a space station in an orbit around it. Strange things are happening on the station so Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) goes there to investigate certain things. There are supposed to be three other people on the station. One of them has died, one of them Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) at first doesn't want to talk with him and one of them Dr. Snaut (Jri Jrvet) does tell him things but is a little vague about what is happening. After Kris' first night on the station his late wife (Natalya Bondarchuk) wakes up next to him. Although this is not his real wife but something created by Solaris from Kris his own memories he sees her as his wife. Now that Kris has a Guest, like Sartorius and Snaut, Sartorius wants to talk with him about the events, about Solaris and about its creations. It is not that Kris' wife is only seen by him. Sartorius and Snaut see her too and they even talk with her. She has intelligence although she only knows what Kris knows about her since that is what Solaris knows from him.It is hard to explain exactly what the movie shows us and even tells us. The ending makes sure that we are even more unsure. Of course I will not reveal it but it makes the movie even more interesting. The most interesting thing is how Kris responds to his Guest. He knows she is not his real wife, she even knows it, but still she loves that what he sees.Like I said, there are very slow parts in the movie. Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' also has the slow moments but there the images and the beautiful classical music keep us interested and fascinated. 'Solaris' doesn't have the music but the images are there to enjoy as well. The movie could have been shorter but because it takes the time to explore things we can take the time to think about that while enjoying some great images. You should give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone (the name unfortunately escapes me now) said about James Joyce's "Finnegans Wake": "It is not about something, it is that something itself." For me, that goes with Solaris as well; I'm not in need of a "go-ahead-plot" or rather, that plot holds no real importance if the overall mood of the work sucks you in like Solaris did. Hypnotizing.Some people I know complain about the lack of action in the film, I say to them there is lot of action there, but you'll have to tune in first. The action's really in your head.I found Solaris' "something" obviously in the last scene, the taxi drive scene, and in the beautiful nature shots.As with today's music, 99% of today's cinema is pure depressing shite. Finding exceptions to the rule like Solaris makes the search worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely in my top three.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big science fiction fan. I very much enjoy the cerebral involvement that comes with the genre - or SHOULD, at least. I enjoy it even more when it has an emotional context. Good science fiction is still largely confined to the library in my opinion, but there are some good films. Solyaris is among the best.I've only seen it once. Last night it was on Netflix and it looked good so I watched it. I'm VERY glad I was able to stumble upon this movie. For me science fiction is mostly about the concept. I want my mind to be challenged. The story is very important definitely, but I appreciate an imaginative, creative, and intelligent concept above all else, and this movie delivers.I think a lot of people miss an important detail about this movie, one which is central to my interpretation of it. The guests are NOT hallucinations or ghosts, or anything abstract. They are matter, and they're really there - just like you and I. Sure they are explained to be made of neutrinos and not true flesh and bone, but it's really all the same at it's core. Wouldn't Kris agree? To me the most substantial conclusion to be drawn from this film is it's existential dealings, specifically with our human perception of life. We are organized matter convulsing and reacting to chemicals. That is the scientific view. There is nothing abstract in the makeup of who we are. So really are we only imitating "life?" What was Hari's reproduction? Organized matter imitating life. Not as aptly as a human, because it wasn't human - but was that the only true difference between her and the "real" Hari? Kris felt love for the reproduction very strongly. But wouldn't that be a natural thing to occur since after all, love is only a chemical - matter reacting to matter? At the end we see Kris back on Earth, returning to his home. However he is actually on a large scale reproduction which is one of the islands formed by the Ocean. But how could Kris ever know the difference? Your loved ones, your home, your emotions, your memories and this world are made up of matter that can be reproduced. Physical material... does it end there?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From some of these user reviews, I was expecting three hours of torture when I rented this. I figured I'd have to watch it in small increments. Not at all. I found it an unusually engaging film that had my full attention at every scene (I did have to get up and stretch a couple times). Apparently some people cannot handle the idea of simply appreciating an image without a lot of action to go with it. People will listen to music for long periods of time to put themselves in certain moods, why can't we do the same thing with film? Tarkovsky is clearly a genius to have created an alien but utterly convincing world on a limited budget. His claustrophobic space station equals any of the sets in "2001." He also manages to create a feeling of terror without showing anything frightening, a very impressive feat. Look at the scene where Kelvin's dead wife appears out of nowhere: the glowing pink light, the odd humming of the soundtrack (the music is surreal and equally impressive as the visuals) and the expressions of the two as they look at each other are all so eerie. Yes, it's a very slow scene, but that only adds to the feelings of anxiety. The movie made me feel extremely uncomfortable, and I mean that as the highest compliment. The minimal dialogue is also interesting without sounding stilted, and the story is timeless. If I had to name one thing I didn't like, it would be the jarring changes from black and white to color (which may have been due to the budget), but the shots remain fascinating nonetheless. It's not for everyone, but for lovers of intelligent science fiction with working attention spans, this is a must-see. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most commentors who take place in "Hate it", I find it unbearable, too. Not 2x, even 8x speed could be unbearable also. Solyaris took place among the most terrible films of my archive. Tarkovsky could give the messages about the concepts with 1:30 timed film but 2:30 time is very long for it and certainly I must have watched it before I go to bed.Wherever you look at it, this film is terrible. Only musics are exception, but directing, acting and the others mean nonsense for me. The time may be an explaining factor but if it was tranferred to white-screen now, I would define it disaster in the name of cinema history.</fullReview>

If the director thought the audiences are unrelated to the film, he should have directed it for his own entertainment at home. Why bother putting it on the big screen? Let's all say "to the hell with it" and move on. Who is Tarkovsky? i don't know Is he the person who makes boring movies?

		<shortDescription>An introspective sci-fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solaris's main focus, in my opinion, is on what makes humans human. What defines a person? Is it memories? Is it the body? Is it emotions? How would you react if you met an entity indistinguishable from a person in almost every aspect? These and other interrogatives are examined on the movie, which asks also some philosophical questions. For example: what is our purpose being alive? This is the first Tarkovsky's movie I have watched. Many frames of the movie look like paintings. How not to mention the first opening minutes. Vibrant colors characterize nature on earth, while cold colors are reserved for the space station. It needs to be noted that instead of the customary dark, white light enters from the windows, because of Solaris ocean, like the name implies. Tarkovsky doesn't show us a optimistic vision of the future. We have a rundown space station, with only three people on it, on the verge of madness. There seems to be no way to make contact with the ocean of Solaris and throughout the whole movie there's a strong atmosphere of in;communicability. It is a very introspective movie, despite being set in space most of the time. A moment of dramatic tension is when the "guest" (as they decided to call them) becomes aware of the uniqueness of her existence. Especially as this realization comes together with a decreasing difference with respect to any human being. By the time the movie is close to the end, she's indistinguishable from one. So the question is.. is she a "real" person? What defines a person? How does she feel about her condition? What about her feelings or thoughts? Are those really hers? The movie can be a little hard to watch as some scenes are a little too drawn out but on closer examination they set the necessary pauses to ponder about the points the movie is trying to make. It also serves to set a contrast between scenes similar in purpose: for example we have a man driving through the highway for five minutes (almost) while the trip to the space station is much faster. Notable also the use of some black and white scenes in contrast to color ones, to set apart the past, dreams, memories.. although there are some changes and I will probably need to watch the movie again to be sure. The conclusion some characters reach is the necessity of looking inward and the impossibility to understand that which is greater than us. It is in this setting our protagonist experiences deep conflict and has to make a final choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The need to remove context (Earth) to allow us to ask Important Philosophical Questions of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie because its a sort of must see like Brazil, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc.It starts off with an astronaut being ridiculed for stating things that the general people (the highly intelligent scientists, important people etc.) find unbelievable and discard as delusions. Since these happened on a different planet, they then send a psychologist there to evaluate the situation.The rest of the movie is about the circumstances that slowly 'forces' the psychologist to ask difficult questions regarding life.In the East, you hear such questions being asked and discussed since you are a child, so its natural and easy to ask it when life goes awry. In the West, only when someone is older and experiences huge pain that they tend to ask such questions and by then you are so prejudiced that its a struggle, so this is like a big deal. I guess that's why this movie is highly regarded. But to emphasize this point they have made this movie too serious and this I think degrades our receptibility. There are so many fantastic movies on the IMDb top 250 which bring about this point, and they all do it in a way that touches your heart (because the way inside is through our heart), but here it was dry and cold.But do check out this movie, you may appreciate/enjoy it, but even if you don't it won't be a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The anthropic principle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting (although not entirely faithful) adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's masterpiece, one of the rare science-fiction works daring enough to explore the first contact with a truly alien extraterrestrial life - not anthropoid creatures who display familiar, understandable goals and emotions in spite of unusual hues, but a genuinely incomprehensible, advanced entity. See also Lem's novel "Fiasco".The living ocean of planet Solaris is able to tap into human consciousness and materialize dreams and desires in the form of mysterious "visitors" who appear in the station inhabited by human scientists: for psychologist Kris Kelvin this means the return of of his dead wife - or at least of a projection of her, someone who is subtly different from a real person and yet keeps growing more and more human.The best thing about Solaris is how the entity's motivations are never explicitly stated. Various possibilities are analyzed: are the apparitions a gift from a benevolent being? Or maybe some kind of test, a way the ocean uses to interact with a life-form so different from its own? The answer is left to the viewer, in one of sci-fi's most tantalizing Rorschach tests.Tarkovsky directs with elegant unbroken shots and a deliberate pace. Horrific moments are barely glimpsed at; the main tone is lyrical, melancholic. This adaptation downplays the scientific elements of Lem's story and puts a religious, mystical spin to it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever Lem says but those who have read his book and watched the Tarkovsky's probably will prefer the latter. Here is one of those exceptional cases where the film adaptation of the book is better than the book itself. Unfortunately, this, in my memory, only happened with science-fiction. This is not in the best way characterizes the artistic merits of Sci-Fi, but on the other hand, allows you to appreciate the value of the method of fantastic assumptions, which makes it possible to focus on some real problem, comprehended it through the work of art. Tarkovsky in his interpretation of Solaris shows the problem of morality, the ability to "remain human in inhuman conditions". He has done it masterfully, adding everlasting depth to some regular sci-fi story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Tarkovsky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky is a director that I have seen little of over the years, and yet admire his directing style so much that I would love to seek out more of his work. while in my eyes something like this isn't as good as the only other Tarkovsky I've seen (Stalker) this still has a lot going for it that makes it worth your time.The plot is that a psychologist is sent to the planet Solaris because of the strange occurrences on the planet. The very nature of the planet being surreal and incomprehensible to humanity at this point. He agrees and when he gets there there are only 2 people left but soon life begins to manifest and take the form of his wife that died 10 years ago. This version just being how he sees her can rapidly heal from wounds and get resurrected, but she can't leave his side and she's slowly becoming more human despite being ostracized by the others that don't believe that she is human, as time goes on she slowly becomes more real while she has fallen in love with the psychologist despite never being able to leave Solaris.I'll star off by saying I love the directing style. Tarkovsky has the talent make things seem dream like due to the pacing of shots and other such things. The cinematography and set design looks brilliant even today. The sets looks like some unseen corners of places in Star Wars. I also love the questions it brings about love and life in general. Really thought provoking stuff.If I was to name a complaint it would be the ending. How it ends is basically that the sea that created the psychologist's ex-wife takes a blueprint of what is exactly in his brain and has some memories of places rise up and become islands, and what's on them are almost literally different parts of his life such as his father inside his house. I just think it's unfitting to the character that he would stay now that the copy of his wife is gone completely, I mean - he stays on Solaris to go to a copy of his house where a copy of his father is in despite both being fine on Earth, I mean I know the question is if he really cares that it's not really that but it seemed earlier that his arc was finished and was going back.If what you're looking for is highly thought provoking science fiction, shot like a dream and kind of around the middle of the spectrum (the other ends being a normal film with a lot of subtext and extremely weird that people have to read deeply into it to figure out what's happening) then this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't know what to make of Solaris.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On Solaris, Roger Ebert made a statement along the lines of: "with a modern editor, this film could have been cut to have of its length." So it's long. As I've noticed from many viewers' criticisms, the slow pacing comes up. What hinders Solaris for me is not that it's necessarily slow-paced, but some of the shots, like the notorious "car scene," are just...I don't know. Yes, I realize Tarkovsky is trying to create atmosphere?which he is a master of, but maybe this movie just was not for me.One has to truly be in the right mindset to sit down and watch this beast start to finish. While watching this movie, I thought: "wow, this is beautiful," and in the next scene I would just think how pointless that scene seemed. Tarkovsky's films are all like this; I actually preferred "Stalker" because I felt that Tarkovsky's drawn out pacing and attention to the beauty of "nature" worked better for that story.This is one of the most unique films I've seen in a while. I don't think many modern directors would, or even could, make a film like Tarkovsky did. Solaris can put the viewer into a truly reflective state with its slow, quiet scenes.Here's another element that bugged me though: the lack of sound. This film is extremely quiet; I'm not a fan of such a lack of sound. I much preferred Eraserhead's buzzing, ambient noise over Solaris' blankness.Solaris' story has been said to be a great look into the human condition, which I agree with on paper. The acting is pretty amazing, but the characters and the writing are nothing special. The way the story was told in the film just did not appeal to me?but like I said before, those in the right mindset to watch this film would be delighted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donatas Banionis confronts himself via Natalya Bondarchuk above an alien planet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarkovsky thought that "Solaris" was an artistic failure by being too heavily influenced by the science fiction technology and special effects side and losing some of the human side. However, the movie is plenty deep enough. If you like or love Russian poetry, literature and philosophy, including religious philosophy, then you will recognize and appreciate its impact on "Solaris" and its presence therein. There is a quest to understand the deepest questions. What's real? What is a human being? What are the limits of knowledge? How do we go about obtaining knowledge? How should we go about this? What is our relationship to our surroundings and to God? What are the limits of scientific knowledge? How much of what we claim to know is conditioned by being human? There is a fondness for contradictions based on two lines of thought that both seem reasonable, that is, paradoxes and antinomies. "Solaris" has some of that too.In this story, a psychologist (Kris) leaves his father behind on earth to travel to a space station (Solaris) that now has only 3 men on it. The project is thought to have failed to achieve results scientifically. Kris is supposed to report back on whether or not to close the project down. Two men are still there. The third has committed suicide. Kris begins to experience what they have, which is the appearance of human-looking "guests", as they call them. They are unnerving. In Kris's case, his long-dead wife, Hari, comes to him, and he cannot help falling in love with the resurrected being. There is an Adam-Eve story embedded here. Just as Eve came from Adam's rib, Hari comes from Kris's emotional projection and memories to the planet's swirling sea-like surface below the station. It has some sort of consciousness and capacities to respond to the human emotional vibrations, if you will. This is even magnified toward the story's conclusion when the scientists transmit Kris's brain encephelogram to the surface. What we see occur in Kris is such a powerful emotional reaction to his experiences with the planet and the new Hari that he decides to stay on the space station. Science and scientific investigation take a back seat to love. Hari has self-awareness and knows that she is not his dead wife, and she develops human feelings. It is as if an android has been created that becomes human. Her development raises the question of what a human being is.The movie is visually advanced and highly artistic, but the story and character developments do not attain the same level. The philosophical aspects are treated more deeply in the 1979 "Stalker". But this movie is warmer and hits our hearts more than "Stalker", and this is because of what the Hari character goes through. "Stalker" lacks such a sympathetic female character except briefly.Both "Solaris" and "Stalker" are at their best in the production and set designs and in the challenges to our minds. They are best at reaching artistically even when they do not succeed. Their characters are generally distant, however. They are tortured. They are not especially likable; the actors are not being directed to make them especially likable. Their suffering predominates and they do not communicate with one another either readily or normally. They have not found peace in this world. Still, one does move into their world and travel with them during the story. One is not bored. One is not left feeling cold, but one is left feeling more puzzled about what the results are of everything the characters have gone through. No sharp point is made, intellectually or emotionally. It is more a diffuse feeling of motion through an impenetrable fog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with Kubrick's "2001", Solaris is a valuable reference to all the rest, tens and hundreds of imitations, not only in the sci-fi space, but in the general cultural space. While Lem's book is superb and predates Tarkovky's movie by more then a decade, the 1972 Solaris is a bit long for watching and not as satisfying after reading the book. the truth is Lem was a genius. Tarkovsky is a poet of the cinema, ready to take on the challenge of putting on screen major philosophical questions about humanity, its options and its destiny as viewed by Lem. I found the acting and the dialog a bit lacking in value, as if they were either trying to follow the script as ordered by the director or a bit too rigid. Russian language does not help either and I supposed the subtitles either. Donatas Banionis is lacking a wider range of expressions to make this role memorable, reminds me of the more recent failures like Johnny Depp. Natalya Bondarchuck is barely age of consent and a total rookie, except being the daughter of the big shot of Soviet cinema that Tarkovsky probably needed to get the project off the ground. This was 10 years before he decided to stay in Italy and defect from the KGB state of Andropov and nowadays Putin.all in all a memorable piece - a must see before you go the movies again or watch any other imitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed the first 26 minutes of the movie and that may account in part for the fact that I found it confusing and challenging. Evidently, a scientist, Kris, is sent to a remote space station orbiting a distant planet to find out what's going on. One of the three or four crew has committed suicide.Kris finds the remaining scientists a diverse lot. They're hospitable enough, showing him around the spacious circular craft and telling him he can choose any room he likes. But Kris notices a few strange things. There seem to be "others" wandering around. A young child (or maybe a midget) appears briefly, a scientist sweeps the kid up in his arms and runs off with him. Kris catches wispy glimpses of a young girl from a distance. When he asks about these figures, the others tell him to mind his own business, except for the leader of the crew, Snaut, who answers with philosophical non-answers about what constitutes happiness and what man's fate is and other heady subjects.It gets headier. Kris falls asleep in his bed and a girl appears, Hari, with whom he once consorted but left, not loving her, until years later when he realized he did. But by then she had committed suicide.Now here she is again. Apparently alive if not exactly vibrant. Finally the other scientists spill the beans. They've bombarded the ocean below with heavy radiation, and the ocean seems to have responded by redintegrating figures from the crew's past -- a child, a young girl, and now Hari.The problem is that the "guests" are just that -- materialized figures drawn from memory. They're described as made not of atoms but neutrinos. "Masses of jelly," one of the more cynical scientist calls them. And they're incomplete. They retain only flashbulb memories of their own past. And you can't get rid of them because, sooner or later, you must sleep and dream, and they return. Kris, for instance, sends one off into space in a rocket. No dice. Next time he nods out, Hari reappears.The headiness persists. Obviously, the movie is either profound -- "deeply profound" -- or just thrown together in a slapdash manner to make it seem provocative. The sound track sometimes comes up with an ominous hum, at other time an organ piece that sounds like Bach with a hangover. There are quotes from Cervantes and Tolstoy. Ultimately, Kris is faced with the choice of either staying aboard with his passionate but insubstantial neutrino wreaths or returning to reality on earth. He chooses the latter and the final scene was so unexpected, so much a non sequitur, that it left me wondering if my brain had turned into a jellied mass of neutrinos.It's all very melancholy. Kris never laughs, never even smiles, nor does Hari or anyone else, except for one or two puzzling cackles from a drunken man. I'm going to assume that instead of being meaningless it's chock full of ideas, though I may have caught less than half of them. It's long and it's slow but it's not simple minded. Cf., the "Twilight Zone" episode called "The Lonely," in which an exiled convict is given a very humanoid female robot for company and simply falls in love with her. Kris's attitude towards his "robot" is far less ordinary. And then thee are questions about the frontiers of science. Should we really try to change something we know little about? We're currently exterminating previously unknown species of primates in the Amazon rain forest. Primates -- that's us. Well -- judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At different points it is beautiful, insane, chilling, but ubiquitously deeply pensive. Yet throughout this lumbering psychological odyssey we are surprised to find the ideas constantly relevant, though they are not overly familiarized in this esoteric setting. It is the opposite; we are skillfully enveloped into this world-view. This movie is very long for good reason. Forgetting reality outside the film for a few hours we understand the strange dilemmas which are presented and exit with a mind evoked both visually and philosophically.Cinematic technique is outstanding. Simple and subtle cuts and motions combined with tinting and lighting constantly direct our emotions accurately and powerfully. Special effects are rather poor (as might be expected from a Soviet film) but sets are well designed. Acting is stellar especially from lead female, though also a bit difficult to judge while viewing in Russian with subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"2001" by way of Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How fascinating that one might not see this is a creation story until the final, foggy frame!This film is solemn, dreary, and somewhat repetitive and inscrutable, but it raises some fascinating questions. We can't see until the last scene that foremost among these is: Where did we come from? The dialog clearly was influenced by Ingmar Bergman: It is cryptic, profound, and self-important. The neat, white sets seem to be channeling "2001: A Space Odyssey." I enjoyed the god-like musings of Snaut, who seemed to view man's search for extraterrestrial contact as futile and beside the point. "Man needs man," says the man who seems to have no real need for man. For a while I wondered why the space-station crew bothered with radiating Solaris's ocean. That created the "guests." And there didn't seem to be any rationale for transmitting Kelvin's encephalagram to the ooze. Yet that seemed to have obliterated Hari and her ilk in a kind of fresh new start, causing islands to emerge from the mist. It is sad to think that Kelvin couldn't go home again and yet he seems profoundly grateful for what he does encounter. The final scene in this film is transfixing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solaris - A Philosophically Brilliant Scifi Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily the best scifi movie I've seen to date. The visual effects are hardly there(understandable as those were the 70s) but the makers of Solaris bring as much realism as they possibly could, and the results are splendid.Of course, there are endless discussions at IMDb board &amp; elsewhere on the various metaphors or interpretations in many scenes of the movie. But it does not matter. Either way, the movie really leaves you thinking &amp; pondering of the mysteries of life on Earth or beyond.Great acting by all the cast. Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari the deceased wife of psychologist Kelvin was fabulous. Even Donatas Banionis as psychologist Kris was searing in his performance.The best part of the movie? I think its the dialogues. Many of them were gems. All those philosophical talk on life between Kelvin and Dr. Snaut as they struggle to survive in the space station amidst the bewildering happenings around them is deeply touching.A flaw maybe? The space station or the alien ocean may not have been accurately made up or visually perfect but it sill fits convincingly with the plot.Verdict: Solaris is brilliant. Flawed here &amp; there maybe, but still a scifi great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never seen a Andrei Tarkovsky movie before, even though he is generally regarded as the most famous Soviet film-maker since Sergei M. Eisenstein but I definitely intend to see more movies by him now. He seemed to be a film-maker with a love for the art of movies. His directing is passionated and he really knew how to tell a story, despite the fact that this movie is slow...very slow! No wonder that the movie is 165 minutes long."Solyaris" is definitely comparable to Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey ", not just with its story or concept (or better said the confusedness of it all) but also definitely with its style and pace. The movie doesn't feature any more dialog than necessary and there are large parts in the movie were no word is spoken at all.It's a rare true intelligent science-fiction movie. Every sequences can be basically interpreted in your own way. It's true poetry captured on film. Certain sequences have deeper meanings to it, somethings you'll catch, others you won't. This is also the reason why "Solyaris" is a movie that only gets better on repeated viewings.Besided science-fiction, the movie can also be seen as a drama, a mystery movie and even a romantic one. The fact that this movie is labeled as a science-fiction movie doesn't simply mean that it's about space or the future. "Solyaris" is about many things and it above all is a very humane movie, with a realistic touch to it. Even though it has an unusual story and some unique storytelling the movie is not that hard or completely not understandable to follow as you perhaps had heard or would expect from a movie with a concept such as this one.The movie is based on the novel 'Solaris' by Polish auteur Stanislaw Lem. In the beginning of the pre-production stages of this movie Lem was still very much involved and spend lots of time with Tarkovsky in Moscow, developing the movie. The collaboration however did not ended well since Tarkovsky (as every director) wanted to make some changes and additions to the story. He also wasn't too happy with the end result, though his points of criticism don't really seem valid to me. He just complained because it wasn't exactly like his book and Tarkovsky in parts put the focus on different aspects, which simply works out well for the movie and are a foremost reason why this movie is such an absolutely great and effective one.An impressive and just plain great, intelligent Soviet answer to "2001: A Space Odyssey".9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are made of memories, our memories, pleasant or unpleasant, some unfinished, every second that passes becomes a memory, we act according to our experiences, even if we have evolved and almost have forgotten the past, we can never live a future without remembering the past and memory. A psychologist is sent to a station orbiting a distant planet in order to discover what has caused the crew to go insane, while he's there, a woman he had loved in the past comes back to life to live with him while they are on the planet. If we could relive a love that had in the past, possibly we would do, but Solaris is nos just about a past love, is about memories, of a childhood and a past love. Solaris is constantly compared to 2001 A Space Odyssey and there are some similarities, but overall they are very different movies, while Stanley Kubrick really liked Solaris, Andrei Tarkovsky didn't liked 2001: A Space Odyssey. In the beginning, Solaris may look like a space film, when actually is a very poetic and unusual sci-fi film. We're just incarnations of our pain, our past, our memory, our joys, our experience, our emptiness, our hopes and our feelings pleasant and unpleasant</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Vague spoilers ahead that will not ruin the whole movie. I will be putting information from other references and interpretations into the review, everyone will be named should you wish to read into these authors interpretations)."Solaris", stands as one of the great philosophical movies ever made. There is no grand spectacle to behold, no blaster rifles or even sparkling utopia's etc. Just a wild ambition to pit the terms "Science" and "Fiction" against each other. The production began as Director. Andrei Tarkovsky, wished to bring more emotion and intelligence to the genre, which he found lacking in Western Cinema. Upon seeing Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968), he describes the experience as "Cold and sterile", being too enamoured with polish and looking like a museum of futuristic gadgets. An admirer of Polish writer Stainslaw Lem, Tarkovsky began work on an adaptation of Lem's novel "Solaris" (1961), a narrative dealing with themes on the nature of human memory, experience and the ultimate inadequacy of communication between human and non-human species.Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), spends his last day on earth preoccupied by the lakes and nature around his childhood home with his elderly father. He is about to set off to a space station orbiting a planet named Solaris, a sentient planet whose surface is entirely made up of water and after decades of studying no progress has been made. The crew on board have been sending back erratic messages of emotional crisis, and people arrive to debrief Kelvin who will help determine if the project should continue. After discussing his thoughts with his father, their departure is particularly bittersweet.Kris travels to the Solaris space station to evaluate the situation, to see the halls ravaged and the electrics destroyed. Only a few scientists are there and seem very hostile towards each other. Puzzled at what has befallen them, only to then encounter the same mysterious phenomena as the others. Solaris begins to send "manifestations" of Kelvin's dead wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), who committed suicide some years before. Originally shocked as he tries to dispose of her (It), he eventually begins to accept her (Its) presence, leading to debate amongst all those around them as the planet's surface begins acting very peculiar.Adapting roughly 80% of the novel, "Solaris" has been adapted three times in Cinema (1968, 1972 and in 2002, starring George Clooney). Stainslaw Lem (Who passed in 2006), had expressed that none of them really got to the heart and message of "Solaris" itself, stating that no adaptation decided to question the planet's motivations and man's encounter of the unknown. Stating that his ambitions were to exceed what could be reduced to human concepts and emotion, hence why he never named the novel: "Love in Outer Space". It was reported that while Tarkovsky and Lem had a close friendship writing the script, Lem was furious when production company "Mosfilm" had it drastically changed. Tarkovsky was adamant to have his space station in ruin, various scenes would allude to Rembrandt whilst rooms of recreation would contain iconic art such as "The Hunters in the Snow" (1565), by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (Giving Hari an idea of how humans act).It is by discussing Kelvin's Wife Hari, do we get to the heart of this adaptation. Slovenian Marxist philosopher Slavoj Zizek, points out importantly that she is only a manifestation of Kelvin's memories and not her own, a man's dream or guilt realised. Film enthusiast "Kogonada", has also noted that the dialogue is keen at tackling "Science" against "Fiction" (With Kelvin stating "You mean more to me than any scientific truth" to the erratic Hari). It was a role that had much difficulty getting casted, and Natalya Bondarchuk had finally won it even though she was initially turned down. Her performance could easily be one of the greatest in all of Science Fiction, her tears are genuine and her naturalism blends into the story effortlessly (An example of life imitating art, Bondarchuk revealed in 2010 that she fell in love with Tarkovsky during the filming of Solaris and, after their relationship ended became suicidal).The dialogue I feel particularly stands out as extremely well structured and layered, an element Tarkovsky would later state as his biggest regret saying that in having to explain all the technicality it removed a lot of artistic choices that would feature prominently in his later work. Continuing to re-incorporate classical works, "Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ (BWV 639)", by Johann Sebastian Bach was incorporated as the main theme, plus and a haunting electronic score by Eduard Artemyev. Tarkovsky's long takes and Vadim Yusov's cinematography is as gorgeous as ever. Elemental things from earth such as lakes and plants, to waters and flower pots aboard the station constantly occupy Kelvin's mind, and whereas I feel this deliberate slow pacing will be a turn off for some people, I implore you that there is a deep well of thought here worth your time. The last thing to mention is that all this was made with the equivalent of $829,000 (Given the repressive times the company couldn't afford to put more money into it, no movie should possibly be this good).Final Verdict: There's a beautiful quote I love attached to this film, "We don't need other worlds. We need a mirror". Whereas I personally wish we continue to explore space to its fullest, It's the little things like that in movies like this that can be dissected and interpreted endlessly. I've brought a lot of outsider quotes and trivia into this review, but "Solaris" to me is one of those few films that lead to endless analysis and enjoyable discussion among newcomers and cinephiles alike. It's about love, it's about regrets, "Andrei Rublev" could be Tarkovsky's masterpiece, but this is my favourite among his works and a crucial statement on what it means to be human. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glacially paced but philosophically rich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just finished watching this, there are a lot of things going through my head. Despite being rather dense, I was able to understand the film on at least a surface level although there was definitely a lot more going on beneath the surface. The story, which is rather difficult to describe, is about a psychologist who visits a space station orbiting a planet called Solaris in order to figure out why the remaining crew are insane. However, once there he begins to be affected by the same thing that they are. As a sci-fi film, this is probably one of the most philosophical I've ever seen, with the sci-fi elements pushed back as far as possible. Prepare yourself for heady discussions about ethics and morality in science, memory, love, and what it means to be human. Also prepare for a glacial, but deliberate, pace. I usually don't care about the pacing so much as long as I enjoy what I'm watching. I'd say that I admire this film more than I like it, but I can still appreciate the superb filmmaking on display as well as the rich and heady themes that it tackles. All of the performances are excellent, although I'm not the best judge of Russian acting since I've seen precious few Russian films. This is my first foray into Tarkovsky, and from what I got here I'll definitely be returning to his filmography again, maybe to this one at a later point. Overall, I would recommend this if you don't mind slow pacing and being required to put serious thought into what you're watching. SOLARIS is definitely a classic, but it won't be to everyone's tastes.</fullReview>

Just as all the tarkovskij movies, this is slow. Yet intriguing, scary in certain moments, giving a terrified feeling without expressively showing horroristic events.I think most of sci-fi fans will like this, little sceptical about others.The reason of the rating not being 10/10 is mainly the absence of some things from the book, like Kelvin actually landing on Solaris, and the slightly retro design of the escape pods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An "anti-adaptation" that needs to be edited. Why did we have to spend ten minutes watching the protagonist drive down a highway?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea behind this original film adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's classic science-fiction novel "Solaris" is sound: the idea that humanity finds at the furthest end of its exploration of space... a mirror, so that people are forced to see themselves and stop avoiding the things they'd rather forget.Once the viewer (my wife and I watched it together as we both speak Russian) gets past the tedium which the screenwriters inject into the plot to make it LESS interesting (what I meant by an "anti-adaptation" of the original novel), then yes, that point is made, and made very powerfully.Nothing's wrong with Solaris that cutting thirty to fifty minutes of very boring footage couldn't fix. In that respect, it far outshines George Clooney's Hollywood remake of Solaris, which actually put me to sleep - something the Mosfilm original didn't do. A fine example of what ought to have been cut from the movie is the drive back from the dacha into town over what was probably intended to be a futuristic highway. I thought that concrete, elevated highways were super cool the first time I saw them, too, but as an adult I can say that the whole scene adds NOTHING to the movie - it's just tedium for tedium's own sake.Just ignore scenes like that and hang around for the good stuff, when the psychologist actually lands on Solaris. THAT is worth all the boredom that comes before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Art-house Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Solaris" is a stunning film in every sense of the word. Although perhaps more plot- oriented than anything else he ever made, "Solaris" is still unmistakably a Tarkovsky film. The dreamlike way in which the camera moves, the long takes, and the wonderful imagery is all there. So is the symbolism and deeply philosophical dialogue, which asks so many questions to the audience that the film needs multiple viewings to be fully appreciated.The film, based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem, follows psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) who is sent to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris to evaluate the mental state of the remaining crew members after mysterious occurrences have caused some members to go insane, in order to determine whether the operation should continue. It's an interesting premise, and makes for a fascinating character study as the planet's recreation of Kris' dead ex-wife, Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), leads him to question what he wants from his life: to live in a dream with the planet's fabrication of Hari, or to return to his real life on Earth. As important as the story is the way the film is crafted. Andrei Tarkovsky is the master of creating visual poetry, and from the first frame this is clear. The gorgeous shots of nature and running water establish the importance the concept of nature will have in the film, and juxtaposes the mysterious, foreign ocean of Solaris. The film is drenched in mood, eliciting feelings of melancholy and nostalgia, as Kris re-encounters Hari in Solaris. Also crucial to creating the film's atmosphere is the music. A chorale prelude by Johann Sebastian Bach is featured multiple times throughout the film and mirrors the inner feelings of Kris Kelvin. Meanwhile, the score by Eduard Artemev helps craft the unsettling aura that the mysterious ocean of Solaris emits. The excellent performances by the actors, especially Natalya Bondarchuk, are also crucial to the film's emotional scope.Ultimately, the virtuosity of Tarkovsky's direction makes "Solaris" a beautiful, spiritual film that resonates in the soul. The film builds up wonderfully towards its haunting conclusion, and lingers on in the mind for days. Its a phenomenal artistic achievement, although the slow pace and philosophical nature of the film means that it definitely will not appeal to the mainstream audience. However, for fans of art-house cinema, "Solaris" takes the viewer on an epic, emotional experience. Its a masterpiece, and one of my favorite films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangeness abounds on board a Soviet space station; as questions without answers arise and colourless goings-on dominate proceedings, in what is an oddly frustrating film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrey Tarkovskiy's Solyaris is ultimately a bit of a limp, rather cold and somewhat dreary, albeit worthwhile, piece; a film with a good, healthy idea to it ? an intriguing premise revolving around a space station shrouded in mystery and menace, before mutating in this strange love story of sorts spanning a number of years beforehand prior to being suspended for ten, and then rapidly reignited against all odds. The film starts off as a compelling and engrossing little low key drama; ultimately ending up as a philosophy lecture featuring small groups of men standing around attempting to decode life, the universe and everything amidst the odd space-set occurrence and the identified fact that everybody's either gone very mad or that they just shouldn't be anywhere near where they are.Of all places, particularly given where the film will eventually take us, Solyaris begins in the humble and rather lifeless confides of somebody's back garden to a large secluded home. A man, Kris (Banionis), stands idly in his grounds; a pensive and rueful expression on his face as the exterior calm appears to juxtapose his interior thoughts and chaotic feelings. He is a psychologist, his carrying around of a book with him in this rural locale suggesting the desire to retreat to the peace to read already establishing a sense of who he is; his solemn expression it later transpires the result of the death of his wife Hari (Bondarchuk) rather-a long time ago. His 'peace' is spoilt by the arrival of two aeronautical experts, the venturing into his house to talk giving way to further examples of academia on shelves and so forth; one of these two experts, Berton (Dvorzhetsky), laying everything out for both his and our benefit when he cites the predicament regarding the Solyaris situation and where Kris stands in relation to it. One interesting instance during these talks sees Tarkovskiy quite literally have Berton physically turn as conversations swing so as to face a bird cage housing two or so inhabitants; this, as he outlines the position and symptomatically has the scenario that he verbally confirms of the birds trapped in a cage of sorts more broadly map onto that of the astronauts and their predicament, ie; of being trapped in a cage-like situation up in space.Some more detailed analysis arrives in the form of what can only really be likened to a more contemporary home video set up; the playing of a moving image piece on a large domestic screen seeing a younger Berton cite problems from years ago to an array of higher-ups whom appear to dismiss him; the looming presence of a large, propaganda-like picture of an ominous looking bearded man on the wall persistently behind Berton encapsulating a sense of everything this man says being scrutinised and ultimately dismissed as what might come to be a great Soviet space-race breakthrough is warned against.So the planet, or indeed the space-station, or indeed the whole damn situation is given this lengthly; agonising and rather frightening build-up whilst remaining wholly off screen in a physical sense. Kris completes his formalities, says his good-byes and blasts off into orbit so as to dock there in an attempt to figure out why people are acting how they act and why it is very little has progressed in the way of study or news or whatnot. Kris' arrival in his leather jacket-plus-slacks sees the coming of a man looking sharp; smart and like the kind of guy whom gets a job done. His experience in life and exposure to grief or tragedy or whatever ought to place him in good stead, his smarts given what it is he does for a living ought to stack the odds in his favour. We do not question the man's credentials as he cuts as dash around the space station, the 'narrative', if you will, of his clothing and general appearance as the film progresses hand-in-hand with that of the gradually deterioration of his own mental state as he joins the other cosmonauts in psychologically frittering away.If you love your cynical cinematic jabs at science-fiction films, more specifically, those aimed at more contemporary American ones, and that of comparing such things to atmospheric European films of whatever genre, then one will take glee in stating that when Kris arrives into this brooding; delicate and, you'd have to say, rather hostile, situation, what doesn't happen is the letting loose of some kind of creature allowed to take over proceedings on board this unsettling locale so as to turn everything into a bloodbath. Failing a bloodbath, a 'Night of the Body Snatchers'-style narrative in which something physical is playing with the inhabitants and turning everyone doolally. Rather, extended periods of talking and speaking about the predicament and what it is that essentially happens up on that station in regards to the planet, in that it goes into your memory and resurrects the deceased, is the order of the day in what is a film that most certainly requires a certain artistry or guile to it. The film is far from bad, indeed is rather easy to admire in its clinical nature of addressing what it is that it takes on and at its aptness at what it does better than what it doesn't; but the overall coldness to proceedings does enough at times to turn the film into a bit of a chore, Solyaris ultimately an alienating feature running on some good ideas it doesn't really have enough of to justify the runtime and a lack of anything concrete to actually get behind nor zero in on and get involved with.</fullReview>

Once aboard, strange occurrences begin and Kelvin is joined by his long dead wife Hari. Through disbelief and love, Kris begins to connect with the replicant of Hari.Solaris is a film to be seen. It's a beautifully crafted, sci-fi masterpiece that owes much of it's brilliance to it's director. Andrei Tarkovsky is a wonderful filmmaker and he has made none better than Solaris. Excellent camera-work, with shots that admittedly go on a bit too long and slow pacing, because Tarkovsky takes time to tell his story. I also love how color plays a major part in this film. The colors are wonderfully light, yet textured. Solaris is a marvelous film to look at.At the center of this film, though, is an understated turn from Donatas Banionis as Kelvin, a unhappy, middle-aged who initially struggles with, but soon accepts through disbelief, redemption and ultimately love, his new version of reality and his regained relationship with Hari. It's a very strong turn from Banionis.Other than that of Natalya Bondarchuk, the other performances in this film are superfluous. The film is full of big ideas and is open to interpretation, but works best as an often tense, sci-fi love story. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, deeply symbolic sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually take books far more seriously than the films based on them, especially books as deep and poetic as 'Solaris'. But for me, this film is a complete exception to the rule.This film is an intriguing odyssey into the depths of the human soul - the isolation aboard a space station orbiting a mysterious planet with a single jelly-like organism covering it, is a metaphor for places within ourselves where we do not dare to tread; our deepest, darkest secrets and desires. Throughout the film, we watch characters searching for a purpose in their lives, then settling for an illusionary one should they find none. The subtleness of the story means that it may take multiple viewings to understand, but in the end creates a haunting, deeply unsettling masterpiece.Haters of this film have pointed out that it has a very slow pace, and I must say that this is true. But the quiet scenes have a remarkable beauty and symbolism - perhaps the ten-minute scene of a car on a highway represents a loss of purpose and meaning in life? In this age where whole worlds can be created and destroyed via computers, the effects are also slightly less than stunning. So, not to sound patronising or judgemental, but if you like action and effects, go watch Star Wars or Speed Racer and stay away from this film. If you like deep, thoughtful, symbolic and minimalistically beautiful films, please do yourself a favour and watch this piece of art.</fullReview>

There are 2 ways to escape it in the film - industrial (remember city traffic scene which my city becomes similar to) and spiritual (remember the process of Hari resurrection). Each character is more or less get used to escape in some way except Kelvin. Only such hesitating and insecure person is able to bear his cross. To face his faults and return to his roots. The most impressive scenes are city traffic and home emerging from Solaris ocean. I think I was able to see a giant slippery baby emerging from the ocean in the end of Burton's presentation. But it was so scary I escaped...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the tremendous privilege of seeing Solaris on the big screen as part of the Russian Film Festival a few weeks ago. I had seen it on video, but seeing it on the big screen only emphasised how good the film was.A common complaint about this film is that it is too slow. This is somewhat understandable - the notorious 'freeway scene' near the beginning of the film lasts a good 5 minutes, at least, and Tarkovsky has always been one for long shots.Solaris is far from boring, however. One is filled with amazement at the immense beauty displayed through so many sequences in the film, and so many images stick with you long after - the lake at the beginning of the film, for example. Or the temporary absence of gravity on the spaceship. The painting with the hunters and the village. The blinding light as Kelvin starts to experience his fever. Or, even, simply, the beautiful Natalya Bondarchuk.I'm somewhat interested that this film is referred to as the 'Russian answer to 2001'. While both are filled with amazing shots, this film bears little resemblance to Kubrick's masterpiece, and yet is its equal, at the very least.It is when watching the film's final shot, one that ranks among the best in cinematic history, that it finally dawns on you completely. You have just seen a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going beyond the constrains of sci-fi...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often labeled as Russia's answer to Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey", Tarkovsky's "Solyaris" is one of the most celebrated sci-fi movies in history and definitely Tarkovsky's most famous film. However, and while Tarkovsky indeed stated that he disliked Kubrick's Space Opera, "Solyaris" ("Solaris" in English) was not conceived as a science fiction film to react to "2001", but as a meditative melodrama with psychological undertones that just happens to occur inside a Space Station. This disdain for the sci-fi elements earned Tarkovsky the enmity of "Solyaris"'s source novel author, Stanislaw Lem; but also made the film a very personal work and one of the jewels of Russian modern cinema.At its core, "Solyaris" is the story of psychiatrist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), who is sent to the station in planet Solaris to investigate the mystery surrounding the strange data the three surviving scientists in Solaris' station are sending about the planet's Ocean. At the space station, Kelvin receives the visit of his wife, Hari ( Natalya Bondarchuk), something that shocks Kelvin as his wife has been dead for 10 years. Somehow Solaris has created an apparently exact replica of Hari, but how? and more important, why? As written above, "Solyaris" is not a typical sci-fi film and in this case, the whole Space setting is just that, a mere setting. "Solyaris" is a trip inwards instead of outwards as Kris Kelvin's odyssey begins at Earth, inside of his troubled soul, the day before being sent to space. Unlike the source novel, where the focus was on humanity's failed attempts to communicate with Solaris, the film is focused on Kris Kelvin's relationship with the resurrected Hari, and the consequences of being faced with the chance to mend previous mistakes. Human relations, desires and conscience becomes the movie's themes leaving science-fiction in the background.The film conveys a juxtaposition of natural beauty and cold sterile "modernity", probably to add strength to Tarkovsky's disdain to science fiction. His characteristic use of extremely long takes (following his theory of "sculpting in time") is ever present, but while it does indeed give his films a stunning beauty, at times "Solyaris" becomes tiring (although never boring). Probably this actually was the intended effect, as the film has time lost running as a constant theme through the film. With a very low-budget he builds up a science-fiction film that doesn't want to be a science-fiction film, but that manages to be an intelligent and original entry in the genre.The acting is overall very good, and even when Tarkovsky himself stated that he disliked Donatas Banionis' performance as Kelvin I think that he was quite convincing and that he did a fine job. Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari (or better said, Hari's replica), is a joy to watch, but even when her character is the important catalyst in Kelvin's mind, the focus is always on him. Jri Jrvet and Anatoli Solonitsyn are Dr. Snaut and Dr Sarotious respectively, the two surviving scientists at Solaris. They have small roles, but both give awesome performances that give life to their supportive characters that made them unforgettable."Solyaris" is a complex movie with many layers that while a very rewarding and enlightening experience, may be too slow for modern audiences; to make things worse, Tarkovsky's "sculpting in time" style goes a bit too far, making the film hard to sit trough for fans expecting a fast packed science-fiction film. Howere, despite all this, the film's ambiguous nature and artistic beauty make it a delightful movie. Probably at times it may be too preachy, but it's a great humanistic science-fiction tale.With a deep meaning and a warm humanist philosophy, the film can be viewed as a meditation on human relations. It may not be Tarkovsky's favorite film (he even considered it a failure), but "Solyaris" is an often overlooked milestone in cinema that challenges the constrains of its genre and becomes something else, something more. Something special. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I watched the whole thing one night on TCM. For a two hour &amp; forty-five minute Russian movie from 1972, SOLARIS could have been an excruciating chore to sit through, but although most of the film tested my patience, I admit that it was worth the effort. While many scenes of the movie didn't at first seem necessary to the story (ten minutes of the Moscow highway system?), all of it felt important after everything was said and done. Yes, it's slow, meandering, existential and impenetrable, but ultimately a satisfying, intelligent film that warrants discussion afterward. At the very least, it made me more interested in the Soderbergh remake. While I'm sure there are those who'd compare SOLARIS to 2001, I was frequently reminded of CONTACT throughout it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious adaption of a complex novel- review contains some spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Soviet adaption of Stanislaw Lem's classic is a tedious and slow-paced film that attempts to maintain (with limited success) the psychological nuances of the original story. However, the long scenes and "atmospheric" shots actually make this film pretty boring to watch, not to mention that if you've got a short attention span like me, the subtitles only add to the tedium. Also, the special effects technology does little justice to Lem's description of the fluid and intelligent alien life-form that surrounds the Solaris space-station, an essential feature of the novel. Additionally, much of the background expository notes in the novel are told through "documentary films" at the beginning of the movie, so the mystery of Solaris is something you are already aware of from the beginning of the movie (whereas in the book, the mysteries of Solaris gradually unfold as the main character reads on-board diaries and notes). The filmmakers did their best to show the psychological changes that occur throughout the story but frankly too much is lost. If you get bored with long, cinematic pauses and movies produced by atmosphere rather than dialogue, I highly recommend reading the book, one of Lem's best.</fullReview>

One that you probably will have to make twice to get out of Solyaris what's in there. In fact I thought it was almost like reading a book instead of seeing a movie. Now what is Solyaris about? Everything. There is a star, a planet (Solyaris), a spaceship and a crew whose duty it is to capture the secrets of Solyaris. From a philosophical point of view you could say it is about the limits of our understanding. Not everything is suit for probing by the human mind. Before Tarkovsky made Solyaris he said he wanted to show a trip to a star like a ride on the metro into town. You wouldnt give it a second thought. Thus it is not surprising that Solyaris is completely different from any other science fiction movie. Perhaps Tarkovsky made a intellectual movie about people in which he just happens to use science fiction elements. Instead of the usual Hollywood reverse where a movie is made out of special effects and the plot is thought of later (if at all).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Solaris mission has established a base on a planet that appears to host some kind of intelligence, but the details are hazy and very secretive. After the mysterious demise of one of the three scientists on the base, the main character is sent out to replace him. He finds the station run-down and the two remaining scientists cold and hiding something from him. When he also encounters his wife who has been dead for ten years, he begins to appreciate the baffling nature of the alien intelligence.Based on a novel, Solyaris is a deeply profound art movie by Andrei Tarkovsky in a sci-fi setting. Even though its quite good, it took me three tries to finish this almost three hour long movie. Its extremely slow paced in the first half, not necessarily boring, but some of it is; like the utterly pointless five minute scenes of an old car going through several tunnels, flyovers and looking at skyscrapers which signify a 'futuristic city' but really seems ridiculous even for a 1979 movie. The movie gets a lot better after Kelvin gets aboard the space station and also gets quite confusing. There's minimal special effects and it rides on the strength of its absorbing storyline and actors who all do a good job (Kelvin bothered me a bit. He was too artsy just for the sake of it), the standout being the lead actress, Hari. It showcases a compelling study of human nature, consciousness, existentialism and alien nature. The ending is frankly terrific without the movie ever deviating from its meditative pace.I re-watched parts of it and it makes me appreciate the movie so much more. What I interpreted from Tarkovsky's version is that life began in the ocean of Solaris and from the deep depths there emerged a consciousness. It didn't know where or what it was, where it was coming or what its purpose was. Then the scientists landed on the planet which represents an enigma to the consciousness. The real enigma is the human psyche and existential crisis of us human beings. That this came out of the Soviet Union at a time of communist rule is nothing short of remarkable. Apparently, Tarkovsky himself doesn't hold this movie in high regard. Though it is flawed, this is the kind of sci-fi we should be getting instead of generic good vs evil cgi warfare. Its mysterious, frightening and intensely self-ruminating. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky had told that Solyaris was the least favorite film of me. But in this movie he could pass the border of a science fiction. He would told the souls of human beings never been lost. And Hari's mood and thoughts would be successfully told. Tarkovsky told a lot of things about the Solaris planet, life, death but never gave in front of us. In fact, he chose to ask. I think the relationships between two characters would be told nicely. Especially, Kris' mother and Hari are professionally draw ed.I think when you watch this movie first, you may have a lot of question marks in your brain but naturally this is the trademark of Tarkovsky.

		<fullReview>Preparing to Cameron's Solaris remake i thought it might be good to watch Tarkowski's version, which is said to be hated by Stanislaw Lem. To my surprise, the movie is very close to the original. The only difference between the book and the movie is different moods - while Lem's work is a mixture of dark psycho-thriller and criticism of "academic research", Tarkowski's movie is very slow, poetic and oniric. That's right - if you're an average action-movie-fan - don't watch it, it will make you sleepy. As for me - it kept me awake until 1:30 a.m. which normally happens only on New Year :-)The settings are very good - the space station must've costed a lot of money, and indeed - some places are claustrophobic, some just overwhelming empty. The barely hearable soundtrack just adds to the dreamlike mood, while Bach's organ muisc serves as opening and closing of the picture.Once again - this is not a pop-art movie, so probably it would bore to death average popcorn-eater. But if you're into symbolic movies, that you can interpret any way you like - close all blinds, light some candles and tune in...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could never accuse Andrei Tarkovsky of not giving the viewer breathing space (read: Thinking) within the walls of his films. I have always found Solaris to be a good test of anyone's ability to think, and more importantly, to look at what is being presented to them. Like all the best art, it works on many levels of the subconcious in a sublime fashion.Solaris, like Kubrick's 2001, is often described about being "...a long film about nothing!" Nothing because the viewer has failed to detect or take anything from the piece. These are people who go to art galleries and spend more time reading the little 'synopsis' cards that accompany the actual paintings rather than 'look' at, or into the work.So, what am I saying? I'm saying that Solaris requires Thought, Patience and a love of Visualization over explosive set-pieces.And when you finally 'see' the film: It's magic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solyaris is not the Soviet version of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Solyaris is hardly a movie in anything but the technical sense. It is a series of episodes that fit together in a story about a single man's journey in both figurative and literal senses. Whoever watches this film will be gambling that the emotional rewards will outweigh the three hour investment and many viewers will lose. Those who don't will experience some of the most poignant moments ever committed to film- pain, joy, hope, and despair.It is a cheaply made film with numerous continuity, plot, and photography shortfalls. The film is black and white for a few short sequences and, supposedly, the reason is quite simple- there wasn't enough colour film stock. There are also significant variations amid the different colour film stocks used for the film. While artistry may have been used to make the most of these changes, the changes were due to the same economic constraints that kept the sets simple, rough, and, at times, hardly futuristic. This lack of polish actually suits the subjects of the film- which is human emotion and perception. The "science fiction" aspects of the story are merely vehicles for studying human emotion and perception- it allows the hypothetical to become actual. In this case, the main character is able to experience rather than merely imagine being reunited with his long-dead wife while, yet, still knowing that the experience is not real. Or is it real? Or, at least, is it real in the ways that matter? The viewer decides along with the main character. This contemplation of what is real and important to an particular person is one of the central issue of the film.The movie lends itself quite well to being watched in parts and nobody should be the least bit ashamed for not watching it in one sitting- such is more than most people can do. For viewers who are new to Andrei Tarkovski, this movie is not the worst nor the best introduction- I have a difficult time suggesting a better introductory example of his work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you sum up and make sense of something which is not actually meant to make any sense or meaning? This adaptation of the novel `Solaris` is a typical Tarkovsky adaptation. He writes us in a whole family for our main character. He liked to centre on father/son relationships, and a failed one in this case.As the novels main theme seemed to be a transformation from science to religeon (and that is a simple explanation of it) the film just pursues that idea. The father/son clinch at the end is symbolic of God. The whole notion of the planet Solaris is symbolic of God. Mankind cannot comprehend it, and we have limitations to our thoughts, which is why the story degenerated into something which makes no sense to us. How can we explain the unexplained? When we see something new, we compare it to something we already know, in order to get meaning from it. When we are unable to do that, as we cannot comprehend or fully understand God, we are lost. As is the story.Tarkovsky seems more interested in trying to paint a picture, rather than fully using the medium of film. It is a pretty film to watch, and asks very complex questions, but some might find it a bit tedious and slow moving. The ending is particularly clever, but differs from the book and the later adaptation. You are however left wondering what that was all about, and why? I think that last word perfectly sums up this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strikingly beautiful and haunting,a piece of art!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the release of Solaris(2002), the newest collaboration between director Steven Sodenbergh and actor George Clooney, the work of Polish writer Stanislaw Lem came back to all the attentions' focus after so many years and, taking advantage of the appropriate momentum, Criterion Collection is putting into circulation the first version of Lem's novel, dated of 1972 and directed by Andrey Tarkovsky, also entitled Solaris(1972). Although I haven't seen yet the treatment that Sodenbergh dedicated to the original story, I believe that it would be very difficult, for any filmmaker or for any remake, to touch the grace and the beauty of Tarkovsky's picture.Harder than this is to enumerate all the qualities and unique aspects responsible of making Solaris(1972) such a memorable piece of art, but I'll try,with this brief review,to discuss a little bit about the magnitude and importance of appreciating this film.The first version was produced back in the days when there still was a Soviet Union, and as such there was no preoccupation in terms of commercial success or box office results. That was important, because when there is no expectations around how much money a picture will do, the filmmaker can direct his film more freely and guide his job with his own personal visions and ideas.Solaris (1972) was a very personal project for Andrey Tarkovsky. At first sight,for the people who aren't familiarized with the novel, Solaris seems like your average science-fiction, but for the ones who already read the book, it's clear that is far beyond a science-fiction routine: Solaris is as a matter of fact a beautiful and poignant study about love, life, death and the fragile human condition. The premise is sad and haunting: Kris Kelvin is a psychiatrist dealing with his own demons (his wife Hari committed suicide a few years ago after a terrible argument) when he is called by the Russian Space Program to a mission, in which he must travel to a station orbiting around the mysterious planet Solaris. Covered by a vast sea, it's believed that the planet has the capacity of bringing the most intimate memories and ghosts back to life. Once there, Kelvin finds his deceased wife and both fall in love all over again.Thanks to Solaris, Kris has the opportunity of a life time: now he can fix the mistakes he committed in the past...but inevitable questions arise. After all, is this "new" Hari the ghost of the wife or just a memory brought to life by Solaris?Slow, tragical and nostalgic, Solaris is an opera of unforgettable and bombastic imagery (to think it's a Russian art-film - to this day, I've never seen a movie with a visual so haunting or stupendous like the one of Solaris(1972) . Simply put, the first shot of the planet is strikingly breathtaking,the same goes for the final sequence). Often compared to 2001, I believe that exists an important difference between the two: Tarkovsky picture is way better than 2001 for a crucial reason- while Kubrick's masterpiece tried to be too rational and intellectual in its seek for the origin of universe, Solaris didn't look for the space around us, but for the space inside of us, and for that, it has the heart, sentiment and truth that 2001 doesn't have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris is in a very small group of the greatest film ever made. Going into this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I had heard it was "Russia's answer to Kubrick's 2001". Well, in certain ways it's better. Based on Stanislaw Lem's novel of the same name, Solaris is a science-fiction film like no other. It concerns a psychologist named Kris Kelvin (brilliantly played by Donatas Baninois), who is sent to a space station which is orbiting the water planet of Solaris. Kelvin is sent there because they've lost contact with the crew. What follows is pure cinematic beauty. The cinematography is brilliant (Vadim Yusov). Tarkovsky sets the mood so well, with subtle camera movements. He lets the viewer absorb the scene, instead of using a lot of needless editing. Although this film is not for everyone, especially for those who have little patience. Yes this film is long (169 minutes), but if your willing to give this film a chance, please do, it's well worth it. A monument in cinema history. Utterly stunning.</fullReview>

One of the recurrent themes in Stanislav Lem books is the dethroning of science.The idea that science is just another human activity and it is not worth sacrificing lives to it as if it were some kind of god. In Solaris, we travel to a space station with a team of scientists, people supposedly selected for its ability to think rationally who seem to be affected by some kind of madness. As the main character Kris Kelvin soon discovers, the planet below is putting flesh and bones to their most hidden desires, in his case bringing back to life his young and beautiful ex-wife. The scientists are torn between their reason, which tells them that those characters are just figments of their minds, and their senses, who can see and touch them. The zero-gravity scene, one of the best ever, symbolizes what Tarkovsky considers the summit of European Art in painting and music: Brueghel and Back. But who can worry about art when you can have all that your heart wishes for.I first saw this movie 16 years ago, as a young physics undergraduate and although impressed by it, didn't like its philosophical implications. I probably have seen it 6 or 7 times since then, and I have to say that the older I get the most I appreciate the depth and wisdom of this masterpiece...</fullReview>

I think that it is the best movie made about one of the greatest human quests, the quest of Man to meet God, and we must thank God that the movie wasn't made by an american (it would have become another E.T.).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great plot for a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even when I learned about Solaris until 1982, I wasn't able to see it until last year. The very first notice of this film was given to me by a friend while discussing about Kubrick's 2001. It was also the first time I heard about the nonsense comparison among both films. He (my friend) quoted this film as "the Soviet 2001". Well, I can tell now, nothing more far from reality. As great Kubrick's work admirer, and a SciFi fan, I always rank 2001 as the best film ever made (including all other genera and subgenera). But the work of Tarkovsky is of a completely different nature, philosophy, message, audience, and used quite different visual, aesthetic and economic resourses. For those who both know about the world reality in the days of the filmings, and know about the work of their directors, no comparison is allowable. The film presents a deep refletion on the relationship between a World-Ocean (a womb?) and the deepest memories of cosmonauts encloistered (if voluntarily) in a nearby space station. The ocean influences in their minds, producing the most diverse reactions among the space station inhabitants, offering them the very real sensation of the presence of people that exists in their past, and even ghosts of creatures that could only be present in their minds... up to now. Here love (or more accurately the very soviet feeling of nostalgia) is a central element. Guilt and remorse move Kelvin to see his late wife Hari from a very different angle. He is forced to explain twice that in the last moments of their life together thing among them were not so well. And then she committed suicide. So Solaris (neither hero nor villain of the plot, but only a vehicle) gives him the chance to give peace to his remorses, but only after a very dramatic hesitation and drastic action scene. Even when I am a regular Stanislav Lem reader, I have not read the novel yet, which has been almost impossible to find where I live. Even so, I think the film stands by its own, and little additional information needs to be extracted from the novel to fully understand the node and variations of the plot. And when you ar preparing to a very commonplace ending, Tarkovsky (and maybe Lem too), astonish you with a terrifying one. This is a film to enjoy, to talk about, and to think about. A must for a SciFi viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, minor technical problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I have finally managed to watch the original Solaris. This was after I had seen the 2002 US version and read Lem's novel. I found this to be better than the US version, for a number of reasons. I'll break down this review into sections, where occasionally I make comparisons with the novel and the US version.Plot: (This section contains spoilers) The plot is almost identical to that of the novel, with a couple of exceptions. Firstly, Tarkovsky cleverly decides to place the background of the movie in a form of a message from Burton and a visit to Kris father's house. Secondly, the ending is altered - it is similar to the one in the US version, but in my opinion is much better presented and leaves the possibility of Kris being a visitor or himself open-ended. The movie also leaves out some of the distrust between Kris and the other two crew members and his distrust of his visitor. However, there is no easy way this could have been conveyed properly.Dialogue: Most of the dialogue is lifted directly from the novel. This makes it not quite so natural and the actors seem to have a hard time with the lines. The dialogue here touches mostly philosophical points of man's purpose, the purpose of science, the question of man's identity. A major theme in the movie and novel is the reason why man seeks contact with alien forms. What does he expect to find? How does he expect to communicate? The subject is touched upon during some of the dialogues, but it is mostly something that Tarkovsky, with his slow pacing, expects the audience to think about, rather than explicitly having a character proclaim these thoughts.As far as I can remember the US version does not mention these subjects - it opts instead to explore the nature of personal relationships.(minor spoiler) Some of the conversion of the background to dialogue did not work so well. Burton's testimony, which in the novel is something that you anticipate because of prior build up arouses curiosity to the extreme. However, in the movie you soon get tired - while in the novel I was feeling angst for the committee's refusal to listen to Burton, the movie did not manage to convey me this feeling. The characters do act well, however too many things are said too fast - there is an apparent haste, which does not let the ramifications of everything that is being said to set in.Cinematography and pacing: Tarkovsky's likes to let the camera linger, which is not a bad thing. However I found that in occasion the things that he focuses do not convey much to the viewer. An example is the 'river weeds' frame. While it is nice to have images like that, it struck me that this particular one was not very interesting. Most of the other images though, in the flashbacks of Kris, are very well delivered.The change in the relationship between Kris and visitor is depicted relatively well - the route that the visitor follows when near its breakdown is not very clearly depicted, however.Technical: There are some bad cuts, which detract from the slow, deliberate pacing. The Ocean imagery seemed to have three states: Water, Lava and Bacterial Growth. The transitions between the three were a bit abrupt. Maybe Tarkovsky should have used only one, or alternatively used overlaying with clouds to soften the transitions. Not bad, but distracting.Music: The music was excellent. A particularly nice touch was the electronic water drops sound that played a little tune after the rain.Overall: Very good movie, if you have time for it. If you invite friends to watch, make sure they will not ruin the pacing by excessive comments and that they also have the time and patience for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solyaris (Solaris) is quite simply one of the most intelligent films ever to make it to the big screen; perhaps the most intelligent with the exception of Sergei Eisenstein's magnificent Ivan the Terrible.There follows what may be construed to be a spoiler.Andrei Tarkovsky never again reached the heights achieved by Solyaris. This languid tale instead of reaching out, as do all but a handful of SF movies, delves deep into the psyche of man. The lighting and sets are both moody and perfect; this was probably the first movie which showed us a space station that was anything less than hermetically clean! The leading players Donatas Banionis and particularly Natalya Bondarchuk hold us spellbound. Bondarchuk is beautiful in a manner that is both fragrant and fragile; and sympathetic as the wife/ghost. That a simple journey into the head can sustain one for very nearly three hours is an achievement in itself; that this movie can then go on to make Kubrick's 2001 look very prepubescent in it's outlook says much about Tarkovsky, and even more about the source novel by the highly regarded Polish author Stanislev Lem.This kind of movie making is sadly non-existent today. I urge anyone who feels the need to watch the 2002 American remake to watch the original, and undisputed masterpiece first. (I guarantee you will come away from the remake sorely disappointed) Wallow joyfully in it's wondrous labyrinthine coils . . . . this movie will live fondly in your memory forever . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Clooney/Soderbergh remake first (Clooney miscast) and thought it good but a bit dark in design, like Blade Runner. Tarkovsky's picture is full of light, the 'cold light of day' as if to assert the blurring between reality and illusion that the story pursues. On top of this there is the inspired use of filters and virtuosic editing - the glimpses of the visitors remind one of the reappearance of the child in Nick Roeg's Don't Look Now. At 160 mins, the film is long but the acting is well sustained throughout.Do not go and see this film with anyone even vaguely likely to ask what's happening. The slow pace is to cater for even the quickest to keep pace with the psychological and philosophical narrative. The best explanation is that of the soundtrack, the repetition of the Bach Chorale Prelude, as clear and articulate a running commentary as the Mahler 5 adagietto in Visconti's Death in Venice. 8/10</fullReview>

It is akin to three hours of passive meditation, choicelessly watching how mind works.What will the human race find at the furthest reaches of space? It will find...itself. Or perhaps the Russian will find Dostoevsky!!Tarkovsky certainly has a passion for humanity. Sometimes you can almost feel the camera shouting"What are we!?!"Great stuff.

A warning to the impatient public, used to Bruce Willis: this movie is not about aliens that will eat human brains. Don't expect action. This is purely a philosophical, slow-paced thoughtful approach to the essence of a human being. The best things about this movie are subtle and require careful watching. It helps a great deal if you understand Russian very well, because English subtitles don't do justice to the connotations of the script. This movie is largely built on the Iceberg Principle. Look beneath the surface.I would also recommend watching "Stalker", "Mirror", "Thirty three", and "Kin-dza-dza". They all have overtones of the soviet social analysis/criticism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very contemplative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Altogether a very nice film to watch with a number of powerful, contemplative scenes. Very nice and brutal contrasts mark the pace. Given the contemplative nature, and the length of the film, I believe it is better to have red Lem's book, Solaris, before watching the film Tarkowsky made from it. Just as, with 2001 A Space Odyssey, it is better to have read Clarke's book to get a better enjoyment of the last part, which is also very contemplative - only with Tarkowsky's Solaris, the contemplative "part" is about 90 percent of the film. The few action scenes are quite powerful, stunning even.Interestingly the underlying philosophy in Lem's book is that space and the different things / lifeforms to be found in space are always interesting and always potentially good, if vastly different, because they force Man to find real mental balance, real Harmony, or else he may not be able to withstand what the Universe has to offer. But Tarkowsy basically dismisses all this and his underlying conclusion seems to be that space is bad and we are better off in a cabin somewhere in the Russian countryside.Anyway, overall and though certainly not suited to today's mostly uneducated, and impatient, sci-fi audiences, Tarkowsky's Solaris is probably a masterpiece.Antoine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly interesting premise, but an utter trial to sit through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris contains a pretty interesting premise, about a planet able to manipulate visitor's subconscious to the point of bringing old memories to life--but at a running time of almost 3 hours (and you feel every minute of it), this film contains almost every "artsy" clich in the book, and your frustration mounts as you sit through every scene. At times it seems like Tarkovsky is remaking 2001: A Space Odyssey into a love story, but while the atmosphere of space as boring tedium is captured (too well), the story is not nearly as engrossing. Several scenes just hang, and hang, and hang, and then goes a little longer just to get the point across. Ponderous close-ups of ears, rustling grass, candles--a never ending drive through Soviet rush hour traffic--it seems the director was shooting for a visual masterpiece, and decided to write the story in around it. Like 2001, Tarkovsky left an open ending, but while I was full of questions at the end of Kubrick's masterpiece, my feeling at the end of Solaris was just simply relief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To live without knowing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can try and interpret this film for you, but I wouldn't do it any justice. The flawless acting and plot should only be revealed when one is immersed in the cinematic experience. It is certainly a deep story with many undertones, but one in particular that stuck with me is the reality of perception.Solaris is impactful on many levels, but on at least one, it questions what is meant to be real and what is not. People disregard "insane" stories as simple hallucinations or lies until further proof is given. At a certain point, though, what constitutes real proof is impossible to even fathom and thus define. When in an unknown territory and everything appears foreign, making connections to what you know is true is the rational thing to do. To piece together things at its fundamental level and try to work from there. This works in most ordinary cases. But this movie isn't ordinary.After watching Solaris, I am as excited as I am disturbed. Excited because, in my own eyes, I feel immortal; yet disturbed also because I feel immortal. Not in the classical sense that I can live forever, but from the perspective that I do not know how long I live nor where exactly it is that I live and to where I go. It seems like a nonsensical question to ponder, and maybe it is, but it is a prevailing thought that makes you question. Questioning is good, right? But maybe there is an extent to which good questioning conflicts with a good life...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A meditation on consciousness, humanity and our relationships with mother earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this isn't the science fiction movie to watch aliens and humans blowing the snot out of each other with whiz bang special effects. This movie, to me, has always been a high art film and one that requires you to approach it that way. If you like philosophy and are interested in metaphysics then (hopefully) you'll enjoy it. Last thing I'll say about this as a caveat, I'd been told that Tarkovsky made this film as a response to Kubrick's 2001 because he felt Kubrick was too vague in his vision and used special effects and imagery to impress viewers rather than use good storytelling.I think this movie has so many depths to it that its almost required to watch it several times. The parts of the movie that most people will either find too long or boring, IMO are there for specific reasons and have more resonance if you consider them seriously. For example, in the beginning, Kris Kelvin the cosmonaut is at his farm home in nature. We see extensive shots of a stream, plants, trees, etc. While you could make an easy judgment about the point of these shots as something Tarkovsky is doing to impart the importance of nature, he seems to want to get the audience to get past making quick points and move into a more contemplative place. What I get from these opening scenes is something much more once the movie ended. In this opening, Tarkovsky I think is trying to immerse the audience in the same natural environment as his protagonist. The emphasis on natural rhythms and life on the planet in general is important to soak in when you see how the main character ends up; both in his mind with memories of earth life but also the ramifications on the human psyche when not immediately connected to the earth. Another example of a scene that people find unrelentingly dull and unnecessary is the drive from the farm to the space flight center that will take Kris into space. It's a long drive with scenes of nature giving way to the cement and buildings of city life. I think it's an important transition sequence not just so the viewer can consider the idea that Kris is leaving nature and slowly being absorbed by human made environments which culminates to the space station and then even further, the consciousness of a higher intelligence of the planet Solaris, but the drive sequence shows how we are moving collectively there by paving over and controlling nature. Devaluing it and dismissing any spiritual/psychological value it has for us. This also continues Tarkovsky's immersion process for the audience to go from all nature to more human made environments. It seems to me that he wants us to feel the contrast more fully than a simple metaphorical set of images and in some ways is a very thoughtful F-U to one of Kubrick's most famous transitions of the bone turned to spacecraft. Kubrick's is a quick and dramatic transition. Tarkovsky's languid and less obvious transition refuses to give the viewer any easy way to process it. It makes it a lot more rewarding IMO but I still am a 2001 fan. The love story, such as it is, is one that is both emotional and very metaphysical is one of the most unusual in film history and presented as an honest and real relationship which makes it a powerful one to process. I never saw the remake but the advertisements made it seem like the love story was the centerpiece and to me, it's just a vehicle to pull Kelvin into Solaris' consciousness/intelligence reality. By the time the ending of the movie comes, the questions about the other scientists and Kris's love life get superseded by questions involving what happens when humanity comes into contact with higher intelligence that doesn't come in a form we recognize or in a way we understand. The implications of leaving life on earth to explore the universe may lead us to discover the existence of realities of consciousness that don't fall into established ideas and paradigms we're comfortable with or understand. Solaris offers an example of this possibility and it's very compelling.</fullReview>

This is one of the few films I have ever seen that I am still thinking about 10 years after first seeing it. I will not go into the depths of the storyline because anyone willing to go on this journey for the first time deserves to see it without spoilers. Needless to say, as many other people have said before, this film speaks to the heart of what it means to be a conscious sentient being and asks you to think about what reality is to you and what you are willing to accept it is. If you like this you may like Tarkovsky's other work but none can touch the majesty of this piece which should be on the national curriculum. Oh, and there is a dodgy scene with a dwarf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story that understands the strengths of science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the strengths of science fiction as a genre is that it frees storytellers to deal with fundamental questions that would feel out of place in more "realistic" settings. In real life in the early 21st century, only neurotic philosophers and unfashionable authors spend their days and nights thinking about what makes a human a human, whether our species is fragile or nearly immortal, and whether reality is a subjective product of our flawed memories and perceptions. Most people think about these things only occasionally, since our everyday experience does not demand that we address them, but they are recurring problems of our species and it is rewarding to examine them at length in an artistic way. By setting a story in an indeterminate near future when humanity has mastered long-term space missions, and by placing characters in orbit around a planet that can make human thoughts manifest, the storyteller gives the audience a narrative justification for suspending disbelief, and can raise big, basic questions that in the world of the story are of immediate import instead of mere conjecture. The characters in the story, because they inhabit a time and place that are alien to us but normal to them, are able to behave as normal people would in extraordinary circumstances, and we can imagine that we might behave in similar ways. "Solaris" is the product of good science fiction storytelling on the part of novelist Stanislaw Lem and director Andrei Tarkovsky. Its meaning is not always as plain as one might wish, but filling in the gaps with one's own speculations has always been part of the fun of this genre.</fullReview>

We invest so much in trying to understand the universe that we forget about our relationships with each other. A lot of the movie is sure to remind one of Stanley Kubrick's "2001", but it goes much further in the philosophical respect. It's the sort of movie that should give anyone a lot of admiration for the people involved, especially since the Soviet government probably didn't allow them significant resources. But the truth is that the movie doesn't need special effects. It's all about what the characters come to realize about themselves, and it's a real masterpiece.

		<fullReview>Have you ever heard Pieter Bruegel's "Jagers in de Sneeuw"? Tarkowski's adaption of Lem's novel, four years after the first one (by Boris Nirenburg) and forty years before the Solaris opera and the Solaris stage play, seems to be the first of its kind, the birth of "science fiction" as I know it, including the "full set" of human impulses when dealing with this questions, what we could find on other planets, under other suns. Tarkowski found an end which still brings a shiver to my back. Although I "know" that we cannot make the earth as big as the space or find the immortality somewhere outside.Somehow it feels like Philip Glass knew the Music of Eduard Artemev. And Natalya Bondarchuk is so very beautiful... one of the few in cinema, this essentially belongs to my personal review. This special beauty I saw again only in Jodie Fosters play of Eleanor Arroway in "Contact" by Robert Zemeckis.Remember: it was the time mankind looked for evidences for the last fundamental force of nature, the weak force; the only force that violates parity-symmetry, and it was found one year after Solyaris.1997 the father of Ellie Arroway - materialized from her memories - said, that the only thing to stand this emptiness is 'each other' Andreji Tarkowski left us with a very important issue: it's not possible to distinguish between reality and memory without each other, and that this is the key to find a way how to learn to love the whole manhood - after discovering the basics of nature.He found a way to say this in the middle of the cold war. Not directly but through the lack of it. Solyaris is a kind of "elementary particle physics", dressed in art. And beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solyaris (Solaris) is a fascinating film by director Andrei Tarkovsky, being full of interesting ideas and concepts. It is a science fiction movie that focuses on the human condition and its limitations, also dealing with the subconscious. There are several beautifully shot sequences, including the remarkable ending which can be open for various interpretations. It reminded me a bit of Inception, since both films raise questions about how reality is perceived as well as the embodiment of dreams and the study of the human subconscious. The movie can be quite slow at times, but I didn't really mind that because it never ceased to be intriguing and engaging. Solaris demands the viewer's full attention to details due to its complex and thought- provoking story, which can become a difficult watch for those who are more used to fast paced and action packed sci-fi films. In conclusion, Solaris is a brilliant work from Tarkovsky, being a very rewarding and unforgettable experience.</fullReview>

Few movies manage to point at both, like "Solaris". This is a picture that operates on the borderline between the self and the unknown, between what is alien and what makes us what we are, and even more so: "Solaris'" theme is in fact about understanding: ourselves, the unknown, the bridge between these extremes... all wrapped in one of the most powerful science fiction stories of the 20th century, written by Stanislaw Lem.Lem's book focuses on the futile communication attempts between entirely different beings, humans on the one hand and an intelligent ocean-like form of existence on the other, a life-form which covers a whole planet while producing fascinating phenomena to the visitors from afar. The ocean communicates by materializing physical human imitations, persons created from the memory of the humans - blessing or curse, attack or welcome gesture, who can know? According to Lem mankind thus has to understand that it is merely a "speck of dust" and irrelevant in the general order or chaos of things, however Tarkovsky subverts this view in his own interpretation and intentionally digs deeper into the human psyche. His adaptation adds its very own spiritual twist to the source material and puts man himself back on center stage. Admittedly he opens up more doors than he gives concrete answers in the process, but in doing so he addresses profound philosophical issues in the scope they deserve. After all, it's man's perspective through which we see the universe, and while we undoubtedly fail to see the bigger picture, we learn more about us in every confrontation, especially when they're as profound as in "Solaris". Don't look for special effects or action here, be prepared for an extremely slow trance-like experience that sucks you in and will stay with you.Soderbergh by the way remade "Solaris" in 2002. It is a Hollywood product, has George Clooney, is more accessible and basically a bland sci-fi romance, devoid of Tarkovsky's depth. Take your pick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russia's 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film is a serious competitor to the title "best science fiction movie ever". At the very least, it could be seen as Russian cinema's equivalent to 2001. Is it slow? Yes. But the pay off at the end is immense. Those who can summon the patience to sit through the film will know why. Those who can't should learn the patience needed, because to not see this to miss out on one of the most iconic moments in cinematic history, I should think.When I say science-fiction, by the way, do not expect lots of lasers and fancy special effects. 2001 is much more science fictiony than this one in that respect. Even so, the plot and the climax can leave no doubt about the films science fiction credentials.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solaris is an extraterrestrial intelligence. As remote as imaginable from humanity, it is nevertheless the very essence of human nature which, paradoxically, is an alien. Or, rather, our inability to understand our own nature alienates us from ourselves and others. Solaris is the mysterious workings of the human psyche. All the desolation and chaos therein stem from our efforts to either destroy or abandon what we can neither understand nor control.Kris Kelvin is able to communicate with it by probing his own mind. Essentially, his private thoughts, memories and dreams are reproduced in a physical form that he can actually speak to and reason with. Unfortunately, this physical manifestation of his imagination, Hari, is all too human in that it has no knowledge of what created it. To go beyond this limitation and truly understand our own origins, it is necessary to become one with Solaris. But, possessed by an almost paranoid fear of the unknown, Kris is reluctant to surrender himself unconditionally. That is, until he finally realizes that in order to grow as an individual, he needs to share his experiences with others. In effect, Kris needs love.For all our great knowledge, the origin of life has remained a mystery. And, if we do not even know what life is to begin with, how can we ever expect to find it elsewhere in the cosmos? To fulfill our own destiny, we must journey not through space, but rather through the timeless void that is our own subconscious. Life, after all, is a physical manifestation of thought, and with the power of our imagination we will forever preserver, and ever be capable of raising ourselves to ever still higher levels of conscious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The interestingly designed space station Solaris(which is where we spend the majority of this) has seen reports of hallucinations, and Kris Kelvin, a psychologist, goes aboard to examine the mental health of the three scientists working there. Upon arrival, he finds that one of them is dead, and he sees his wife - who has been dead for a decade. It turns out that the planet they are orbiting is home to some intelligence they cannot fathom, and it brings aspects of their subconscious to life. He can interact with her, but is it the real person? What makes a human being? This explores issues of identity, happiness, man as not being the center of the universe, the foreign and unexplained, connection, communication and spiritualism vs. science. At just about exactly 160 minutes and with its slow pace, it is not for everyone. That is not an insult to anyone who doesn't or wouldn't like it; it is meant as art, and it is for the same type of people who enjoy delving into a detailed novel. Nothing is served up, you have to think for yourself, and no, it does not really take off until about an hour in(not to insinuate that what comes before is a waste of one's time). The direction is brilliant. Once this gripped me, I couldn't take my eyes off it(so for the last hour and a half), and I felt truly engaged in the philosophical not to mention very physical troubles. How do you react to see someone brought back from the dead, as someone who knows that such things do not happen? Is it really them? How, or why not? Meanwhile, those questions don't make her disappear. And then there are the moments that are literally that. Impressions. Half-forgotten instances from the past, what seems so terribly far gone. There are characters that do not get a line in this. They appear for a minimal amount of time. And yet you get an idea of what they were like, the relationship between them and our protagonist. The atmosphere is suffocating, inescapable. This is a visually and emotionally beautiful film. It is not driven by its FX, if some of them remain great. This is not perfect. The car sequence is arguably weak, and Andrei himself remarked that it was there to "get the idiots out of the theatre", for example. Do not bother with the 2002 remake. There is a little nudity, disturbing content and brutal, bloody violence in this. The DVD comes with a 10 and a half minute documentary on Donatas Banionis entitled "Master from the Town", a 5 and a half minute interview Natalya Sergeyevna Bondarchuk(where she gives us fun facts about the production), a 5 minute clip from the movie Investigation of Pilot Pirks, trailers(a Russian and an English one for this, The Mirror, Andrei Rubley and Stalker), a 2 minute slideshow and a 2 minute interview with Marina Tarkovskaya(who provides info about Tarkovskiy). I recommend this to anyone who is curious about it(and consider giving it several viewings, or splitting it up to more than one sitting). 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I sat down to watch this I thought it might be a long haul as I'd read that it was slow paced and two and three quarter hours long; I needn't have worried as the time seemed fly by. It is different just about every other space based science fiction in that there aren't lots of shots of spacecraft travelling through a starlit sky or exotic views of strange planets, most of the film takes place on a space station although you probably wouldn't realise this from most scenes.Set in the future a scientist on the Solaris space station which is orbiting a distant ocean planet has gone missing and the man who went out looking for him has given a report so utterly fantastical that it must have been an hallucination. Kris Kelvin, a psychiatrist is sent to evaluate the three remaining scientists there. When he arrives he finds that one of them has killed himself and the other two aren't behaving in the most rational of ways. This isn't the strangest thing going on there though; he meets another person there, his ex-wife Hari who had died ten years previously. It appears that she has been created by the planet's ocean which is actually a sentient being.The film has a very strange feel to it; there is almost no background music and what there is sounds more like noise than music and the picture changes from colour to black and white in a way that seemed strange to me. Perhaps the biggest surprise however was the total lack of overt politics or even flag waving, I'd expected a Soviet film would have the hammer and sickle on show at the very least. The director and his cast did a great job with a story that could easily have been boring if it hadn't been made so well.These comments are based on watching the film in Russian with English subtitles, not having seen the Hollywood remake I can't compare the two versions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A typical torkovsky movie, very slow. There is a mysticism feel to it. And like any of the directors previous movies this one also sounds philosophical. It makes you think, but at times you reach no conclusions. For example Dr. Snaut says "you love some thing only if you can loose it". This statement is slightly confusing. To think about it one may loose any thing and every thing that one has inclusive of oneself. Is there any thing that we will not ever loose so that we can consider hating it? Is this the context to understand? Or is the context like in - one being very nice to friends because you know you may loose him or her but taking a spouse for granted because there is certain level of tolerance in the relationship and may be less volatile. A GOOF-UP : When Kelvin lands in the Solaris, Dr. Snaut requests him to rest for a while and meet him in the evening or night. Day time, evening, night has no meaning in space!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The intellectual at the helm of this meditative psychodrama, Andrei Tarkovsky, formed a view of cinema that he called "sculpting in time." By this he meant that the inimitable feature of the medium is to take our experience of time and diversify it. Unedited movie footage interprets time in real time. By using long takes and few cuts, he aimed to give us a feeling of lost and passing time, and the connection of one moment to another. He also uses water, clouds, and reflections, along with their symbolism, such as waves or the form of brooks or running water. Bells and candles are also widespread indications of film, tonality and vision, and Tarkovsky's adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's Polish novel has a recurrent motif of introspection.Despite its agreed distinctions from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Tarkovsky definitely uses more deeply distinctive characters and a more tempestuous human drama at the center than Kubrick. Notwithstanding, retrospect lets us discern that the two masterworks are more alter egos than contradictions to each other. Both set up their stories in a measured, unhurried style, giving bountiful duration to tracking around the Earth and space sets. Both make use of widescreen mise-en-sc?ne that extracts top-drawer art direction. Both create an atmosphere of mystery that attracts umpteen interpretations.Unlike 2001 nevertheless, Solaris is drenched in somberness, which clinches the film even before it leaves Earth. In this pensive prologue, we see the protagonist, a purposefully detached space psychologist named Kris Kelvin, staring at underwater reeds as though they were the death of a helpless animal. Played by the stoic Donatas Banionis, Kris looks perpetually wounded, slowed by some grief beyond description. His father and aunt worry about his apathy, chide him for his humdrum temperament. He is about to take off the next day for a mission to the space station Solaris, a has-been project which has been left awry: It will be his job to conclude whether or not to close down the research station.Humans seem enslaved by machinery and TV images, disconnected from the nature around them, underwater reeds, a thoroughbred horse, a farm dog. In his persistent shots of freeways, Tarkovsky spurns capturing any but contemporary cars. Why mask the present world in sci-fi apparel, when the alienating future has already barged in?At Solaris, Kris finds a desolate space station, forsaken save for two distracted if not delirious scientists. A colleague Kris had expected to meet has already committed suicide, leaving him a recorded message hinting of vividly imagined Guests who have "something to do with conscience." Sure enough, Kris' dead wife Hari substantiates at his side, offering the committed affection for which he is starved. She is played in a mind-blowing performance as one of the most endlessly complicated characters an actor could play. We progress into a dogged inversion of conventions: Real terror is in having to watch someone you love devastate herself, the incapability to protect a loved one, the manifold facades or reappearances of the loved one, the inevitability of repeating past mistakes.The true impact of this cinematic development comes from the agony of Kris' resurrected love for Hari, his eagerness to do anything to hold onto her, even knowing she isn't real. The about-face between color and black and white channels something of this metaphysical inconsistency. Centrally, it's a common love story obstructed by a scientific problem. Hari wonders aloud if she has epilepsy, and later we see her body disturbingly convulsing at the edge between being and non-being. Can he only love her if she is human in the sense that everyone else is? I mean, love is love. An elegant, tranquil levitation sequence, when Kris and Hari lose gravity, conveys another characterized likeness of this supernatural periphery. We humans are used to unattainable love, but can any of us experience inescapable, penetratively unifying love?In the mean time, Tarkovsky thickens the dialogue with provocative assertions about reality, identity, humanity, and sympathy, reinforced by citations of civilization's rivets like Bach, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Goethe, Brueghel, Luther, and Cervantes. The Soviet censors may have been pacified by the lack of the word God, but Tarkovsky takes the customary science- fiction theme of spacemen determining "contact" with other phenomenons of intelligence, and enhances it virtually to juxtaposition with absolute being through the alien planet's ocean with its cognizant Chthonic functions, embodied by literal islands of thought. Indeed, the planet in question is a symbol for something the contemporary human condition is not able to understand or accept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the 2002 Steven Soderbergh version of Solaris, starring George Clooney, then read Stansislaw Lem's novel, then watched this- Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 169 minute film version of the book, Solaris (Solyaris), which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival that year, and each successive interpretation I've seen of the work is better than the last, even though Lem publicly disavowed Tarkovsky's film, which was scripted by Fridrikh Gorenshtein. The book is a good piece of sci fi, but it's not great, not that long, its philosophizing not nearly as deep as that which Tarkovsky explores, and is told in the first person, unlike the two film versions, which sometimes gives away too much of the dramatic arc of the tale. Still, Tarkovsky hews closer to the Lem novel than Soderbergh, and Lem apparently forced him to do so, by contract. The film (really both) does make a bit more sense if you've read the book, but the parts that are left inexplicable are fine in a film like this, one that is not about details, but the 'big picture'.The Russian film version has some problems- mainly the ineffective use of black and white scenes interspersed with the color at moments that do nothing to justify the dreamier feel of black and white- although there are a few standout colorless scenes; and scenes of a 'futuristic city'- seemingly shot in the Far East, which just looks like any metropolitan city of the 1970s, and was dated even upon the film's release. Another visual flaw is an early scene on earth where a rainstorm is clearly not occurring, for the raindrops are seen only in the foreground of the screen- there is no realistic visual 'depth' to the storm. All of these are minor, and given this film's limited budget, not really something to worry over. Aside from those flaws, however, the film has rightfully earned its comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's great 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, despite a recent spate of critics who have tried to point out the differences between the two films. While these exist, as in any films, the similarities are far greater and deeper than any handful of differences. Yet, this film also has as much in common with another Russian film, from a decade earlier, and also reputedly adapted from a Lem novel- 1962's black and white Planeta Burg (Planet Of Storms), which was later bought by Roger Corman for American release, and recut first into Journey To The Prehistoric Planet, and later the Mamie Van Doren schlock film Journey to the Planet Of Prehistoric Women. While Lem never acknowledged the similarities between those two versions of two of his works, he publicly disdained Kubrick's approach. But his claim that 2001 was inhuman says far more of Tarkovsky's limits as an artist than Kubrick's?. Yes, there are elements of suggesting that a state of happiness obviates the human desire for questioning, but we can also see the final scene as that not of a human submission to a higher power, but of a human conquest. This is also in league with interpretations of 2001's ending, which similarly has been seen as a human submission to a higher race of beings, rather than a human triumph over mystery, for the Solaris Ocean- with a deeper knowledge of Kelvin and humanity, may now be tamed, perhaps lulled or narcotized, and willing to merely serve up fantasies for its human visitors- as a sort of sentient, futuristic, and extraterrestrial Disneyworld. This hearkens back to an earlier posit in the film, where the men argue over whether humans really want to conquer the cosmos, as they explore outer space, or only want to extend the earth to its ends, which ties into the motto of William Cameron Menzies pre-World War Two sci fi classic film, Things To Come, and its insistence that man must conquer all that lays before him, lest not really be human. Whether or not this, or any other posits that films make need be true is not the point, for art is not philosophy, which is simply about inert ideas. Art is about ideas in motion, ideas put into the service of communication, and as such, Solaris succeeds about as well as any other film that's ever appeared on screen. And, if one is not quite sure what the ideas it has are, there's little doubt that how it is served is memorable, and in that regard, art does conquer all, even if the men that create it might falter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solaris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the belated Soviet riposte to "2001: A Space Odyssey". In many ways it is the cut price version - the interiors are commonplace and unremarkable in comparison with "2001" and the special effects are palpably inferior (they consist of a number of cloud sequences as opposed to the more impressive, though numbing, psychedelic sequence at the end of Kubrick's effort). All this technical inferiority belies the comparative backwardness of the Soviet space project - the Soviets having fallen behind the Americans after the early 1960s, despite the prodigal and futile expenditure.The acting - by the beautiful Natal'ya Bondarchuk, the great Lithuanian everyman - Donatas Banionis, and the brilliant Yuri Jarvet (a Lear for all time), is very creditable. Bondarchuk is particularly effective when recovering from drinking liquid oxygen. The film is exquisitely shot, by Vadim Iusov, who is particularly effective in outdoor scenes (the opening moments, with Banionis contemplating nature in a meadow, sets the tone).In all other respects this is a very tedious picture - like its American counterpart. I am at a loss to understand its considerable reputation. Perhaps it is because it seems so much more thoughtful than "2001" - whereas in my view its 'message' (insofar as there is any discernible message) is at once commonplace (Tarkovsky said that the ending was 'too obviously symbolic'), when it can be understood at all, and otherwise perplexingly esoteric. We are left with a bewildering, pseudo-scientific mish-mash (What exactly is meant by the reconstitution of Hari by neutrinos? What have x-rays to do with anything?). The author, Stanislaw Lem, was appalled and disowned the work; Tarkovsky (who may well have been ordered to confect a 'great work' of Soviet science fiction) did his best to bury this effort. However, this may be the best filmed work of Soviet science fiction since Protazanov's "Aelita".Judged by this film alone, Tarkovsky has the measure of Kubrick. Both have a predilection for excessive prolixity, and both share the belief that image alone will always be a substitute for content. So how about "Barry Lyndon" as the free world's answer to "Andrei Rublev"? This film is not obviously Soviet. The leading characters have curious, denationalised names: Kris Kelvin, Snauth, Sartorius, Burton, etc. At one point - when Burton travels back from Kelvin's dacha - we are transported to the Tokyo motorway system. This was a bizarre and irrelevant insertion that is simultaneously fascinating and irritating (it goes on for what seems like 10 or more minutes). As such it was very effective - I found it so odd that I snapped out the state of semi-consciousness to which I had been reduced. Did Tarkovsky only use this footage because nothing as impressive could be found in the USSR?Odd that Tarkovsky should have invited Bondarchuk to play the lead female role as I gather that he detested her father, the director Sergei Bondarchuk. It seems that Natal'ya didn't get on too well with Tarkovksy, and nor did Banionis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SOLARIS is like a ghost story based on the premise sometimes spirits impersonating dead loved ones visit us, in the film this long old myth is hinted at being an alien life form. The film also hints at bright morning starism and in the end either warns of this or gives the hint of ressurrection in christ. The film balances soviet state athiesm and religion and science and science fiction for a entertaining art film. Filed in japan back when canada , the swiss and the japanese studios featured a boom in the late 1960's and early 1970's, this film is one of the best of russian cinema. Keep in mind this picture is not the action future "retro WW2" noir of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, but more a ponderous look at the human condiiton, memories, and life. Some could argue it is a alternative to 2001. Yet, 2001 being a hard act to follow this film does a good job and approaches the topic of space exploration and the supernatural with the same skeptic science vein. A art film that cannot be ignored...brilliant countryside footage. a mesh of black and white and color.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly Tarkovsky at his least accessible but from personal opinion Solaris is a fine film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not my favourite of Tarkovsky's work(Andrei Rublev) and like I said with Stalker not his most accessible(Ivan's Childhood). It is very long, quite talky and requires a lot of patience, sure almost all of Tarkovsky's film, apart from Ivan's Childhood, are paced very deliberately but Solaris is the only one with a first twenty minutes that puts you off seeing more.However, Solaris is a fine film indeed from a remarkably consistent director(one of the few who didn't make a bad film) and is an important one by his standards and for the sci-fi genre. Tarkovsky's direction is typically superb and it's visually striking, not as dream-like as say Mirror but it's beautifully shot and has a hypnotic quality that keeps your eyes glued to the screen, providing that you're in the right mood or if it's your thing. The music score is both menacing and melancholic and compliments the mood incredibly effectively, one of the better scores of Tarkovsky's films. As ever with Tarkovsky, the writing is very thoughtful in a philosophical way(the most philosophical Tarkovsky film) and the story is one where it starts off very slow but once you stick with it it's very rewarding. Didn't have any real trouble with following it, though it is understandable it wouldn't work for people as it didn't quite click with me first time watching it(I still appreciated what the film was trying to do though).Most effective was how amazingly Solaris worked as a mood-piece. It may not be the most powerful(Andrei Rublev) or personal(Mirror) Tarkovsky film, but it was still powerful stuff, almost as suspenseful as Stalker and had a lot of emotional impact. The ending was spine-chilling, even people I know who dislike it said that they were bowled over by the ending. The acting is fine especially with the heart-wrenching performance of Natalya Bondarchuk. Overall, a fine and influential film but it is one of those films that will captivate viewers and frustrate others. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are we ready to accept that our vision of cosmos and life may be just an illusion of our minds and that other forms of consciousness may take forms absolutely alien and incomprehensible to us?. Stanislaw Lem posed this question several times throughout his many works, reaching with Solaris the pinnacle of his career. Tarkovski adapts Lem's novel focusing the attention mainly in intimate aspects of the personages more than in the technical SciFi stuff. The story line follows the relationship of the protagonist, Kelvin, with his former wife, Harey (who is dead after having committed suicide some time ago)... or more precisely the being that planet Solaris physically recreates extracting from Kelvin's brain the physical and personality features of Harey. The film does not pay much attention to the scientific and philosophic aspects that permeates the whole Lem's novel. This might seem a setback for the film, nevertheless it contains enough values itself to be considered a masterpiece of science fiction, and of cinema in general. Lem's and Tarkovski's visions complement each other extraordinarily, even though Lem did not like and disapproved of Tarkovski's adaptation of his work.But the film absolutely succeeds in creating a dense, haunting atmosphere that traps us from the beginning to the very end. The decaying aspect and environment of the space station orbiting the planet, along with the psychological wearing out of the scientists working there, perfectly represents the despair and powerlessness of humans to understand, let alone communicate with, the vast mass of apparently conscious matter that is the planet ocean, which seems to be able to read even the deepest corners of our very minds, revealing aspects we were unaware of, yet doing it in a sort of unconscious, or naive way... Is it (the planet) just playing? sometimes it seems as if it were learning to imitate others, the way human children do... Excellent performances by Donatas Banionys (Kelvin), and specially Nathalie Bondarchouk (Harey), in a very dramatic role, yet with subtle, delightful points of humor. The film and the novel complement each other, and, unlike so many other cases, both are equally worth to be read and watched.The final scene (and here the film truly overcomes the novel) is among the best ends in cinema history. The ocean recreates a whole scene, not just a personage, in which the protagonist is wholly absorbed, but again, it does it with some carelessness, on earth rain occurs outside houses, not inside them... is it just another stage in the planet apprenticeship process?, or maybe Solaris is also trying to communicate with humans in its own way? we might never know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exquisitely crafted space and mind exploration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001: A Space Odyssey may have invented the slow, meditative sci-fi art-piece, but Solaris followed it in its tracks with its own suit and mind. Because of similarities in their style and method, the two films have been pinned together as rival sister movies ever since their releases and have been compared and compressed time over time by film geeks and scholars alike. That Tarkovsky and Kubrick were both such meticulous (and successful) visionaries in their art direction and scene construction connects the two films more than anything. The main difference is that where 2001: A Space Odyssey is an external peer into the unknown unattainable answers of existence, as spacious and cerebral as it is, Solaris is an internal drama at its core and the connection it builds us with its characters drives the mystery it presents.The film begins with Kris, a researcher/psychologist spending his last day on Earth before embarking on an interstellar mission to the distant and foreign planet Solaris, wandering through the wilderness deep in thought. His troubled mind is reminded of the news that all scientists and personnel who have attempted to examine the planet Solaris have succumbed to psychotic episodes and hallucinations. A friend and former exploratory pilot visits Kris to convince him that his hallucinations were real, and were product or creation of the planet. All this does is further compel Kris to his mission: to assess the current scientists aboard the Solaris space station and determine whether it is reasonable or even possible to continue research. After burning his possessions and keepsakes and having an intimate conversation with his father, Kris closes his life on Earth and departs for space.Upon arrival at the space station, Kris enters to find that one of the scientists, his liaison and friend, has committed suicide and the remaining two scientists are shadowed by apparitions of people from their former lives (coyly referred to as "guests"). The message left to Kris from his deceased friend is that the planet can read minds and would copy and deliver people out of personal memories to those who were near to it. Soon enough Kris is met with his own guest, a replicate of his dead wife, Hari, who appears and acts like Hari but has no knowledge or memory of what she is; with no other anchors, she is attaches herself to Kris.Up to this point and through to the end, what little the film is able to cast in its philosophical glare it exceeds with in environment and internal struggle. The contrast between the settings of Earth and the spaceship are frightening in their scope. Shots of Earth show a flowing, natural beauty of familiar comfort: reeds flowing through a river, rain dripping through the trees and wind rustling through the fields, a cozy lived-in home, animals?. The ship is like a cold, aesthetic Soviet version of a Jetsons prison with sparse, anarchic hallways and either empty or cluttered rooms. In one scene a remaining crewman shows Kris that he can cut a piece of paper into strips and put it over an air vent so that it can mimic the sound of rustling leaves. A loose, dripping pipe is the closest substitute to rain. Kurosawa, after a private screening with Tarkovsky, turned to him and said "It's very good. It's a frightening movie." I can see where he is coming from with the movie's presentation of space life in and of itself.Aboard this bleak, exotic space station, Kris must come to terms with his guest, the closest substitute to his wife he can perceive, a product of his mind that cannot leave him and cannot die. If he allows her existence become a reality, what becomes of the memory of his dead wife and how, with this reality, can he differentiate a copied fabrication of someone from who they are truly representing? These are burdensome questions that story cannot answer but the characters continually meditate on. The film's final scene gives an even greater prescience to these questions and meditations.Tarkovsky's restraint in probing the film's preternatural centerpiece gives the movie a lofty, cerebral air, but holding back its mystery was also likely a necessity to pass the Soviet censors. After the back and forth censoring disputes of Tarkovsky's previous film, Andrei Rublev, causing the film to be suppressed nationally and internationally for years, Soviets footed that Tarkovsky "remove the concept of God" from Solaris entirely. Considering the stakes of a gargantuan production budget it's a wonder that Tarkovsky was even able to pen the script at all without the censor flaring their noses. With careful writing, Tarkovsky avoids the question of creation and being of these strange, familiar human apparitions and instead uses their existence to probe the mind and condition of them and their hosts. In the film we see Kris evolve a relationship with this strange being who for all disbelieving is his wife Hari, and in turn we see Hari, who has no connection to who Kris's wife is, only that she must be her, face the limits of her own identity.Near the beginning of the movie we see the former exploratory pilot ruminating in the back of his private car on a freeway after showing Kris the hearing of his Solaris experience. There is no dialogue, only abstract, minimal sound effects of streets noises and footage of highway to accompany his stark, searching eyes. The scene is approximately 7 minutes long. If you find yourself considering and pondering the positions of these characters and the consequences of their situations, the movie's space is rich and spiritual; however if you find nothing to ruminate on, it's likely that you will find Solaris a lengthy, tedious streak of long shots and sparse dialogue with very little payoff. Luckily the film gives us plenty of nourishment to ruminate on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Engrossing Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (or Solyaris) begins with the introduction of the film's principal character, Kris, at his house in rural Russia. From that moment, Solaris continuously intrigues the viewer with its captivating premise (adapted from a novel) and its distinct visuals. The plot concerns a mission undertaken by Kris to reach a remote space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Soon after arriving, Kris's dead wife appears, apparently having been created by the planet from his memories.The scientific storyline serves only as a backdrop for complex reflections about human emotion. The main question posed by the film seems to be about whether the beings created by the planet are real people, or at least whether they should be treated as real people. At first, Kris treats his wife, Hari, with apprehension and distrust, but eventually he grows to love her.In Solaris, Tarkovsky includes many long scenes that, to a typical modern-day viewer, will seem to be overlong at best and simply boring at worst. However, this is not a weakness; Tarkovsky just refuses to spoon-feed everything that the audience needs to know right to them. Many brilliant moments, such as a beautiful scene where Kris and Hari are floating in zero gravity for (a very long) 30 seconds and the perfect, creepy, and fascinating ending are not given an explanation. Rather, Tarkovsky allows the viewer to come to his/her own conclusions about characters, story lines, and motivations.Solaris isn't a film for every one. It's perfectly understandable for someone to find Solaris' long shots and running time to be revolting and tedious. Still, anybody interested in a surreal, captivating, and unique Sci-Fi film should be sure to see Solaris.Steven Soderbourgh made an excellent remake in 2002. The remake's great visuals, cast, and soundtrack made up for its short running time. However, I recommend Tarkovsky's original Solaris for its atmosphere and intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really have to be committed to the plot in order to see what an amazing film this is. A love story cocooned around a SCI-FI movie. The human condition, other-worldly intelligence and a message that goes far beyond human logic. Love is the universal substance that binds all created beings together. This movie parallels 2001 A Space Odyssey in the search for meaning. While the plot takes a while to unfold, it grabs you and holds you for the duration. A Must See for any movie fan. In closing, I would say this movie humanizes the science fiction movie genre and clearly illustrates that in this universe, everything is indeed connected to everything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Director Andrei Tarkovsky's unblinking manner of filmmaking (eyes open, watching, waiting patiently while recording) can be, at times, absolutely mesmerizing, and this patented style is perfectly suited to his adaptation of Stansilaw Lem's galactic ghost story. While not quite as visually varied as STALKER, this is due simply to the nature of the story itself and is not a failing of the director. The descent into what may or may not be "madness" by the hero seems almost inevitable, and unfolds in "real time" in such a manner that the viewer is likewise drawn slowly in. The viewer becomes voyeur, the camera mute witness. The ending is as lyrical and beautiful as anything you're likely to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a lover of sci-fi, but I was riveted by this movie, no matter how long it was. The movie begins with Kelvin, a psychologist, traveling to a space station on some planet. He views a tape of a previous scientist that has died. This scientist, Gibaryan, warns him about what has happened to him, and emphasized that what he saw was not "madness". While Gibaryan is talking, a young girl walks behind him. The film ends, and Kelvin is bewildered. Soon, Kelvin awakens and finds a woman in his room. She turns out to be his deceased wife Hari. Was Kelvin's wife imagined or an alien? If she was brought to life by his imagination, did this occur because of the solitude of deep space, an alien force from the "Ocean", or some other evil force? When Hari initially appears, Kelvin tries to eliminate her (thinking she was his imagination or an alien) by shooting her off in a rocket. Of course, she reappears unscathed. The other scientists (Snouth and Sartorius) warn Kelvin that they themselves have also had "guests", and that things would inevitably "end badly". Interestingly, Hari is a real entity, and communicates with the other scientists as well. The movie is really an example of psychic torment; even the space station is dilapidated and strewn with equipment, etc. and the scientists wander aimlessly, having to deal with their thoughts. This is a long, intense movie, but fascinating and worth the time.Take it from someone who is not fond of sci-fi movies or subtitles, this is worth viewing.</fullReview>

The film visually alludes at times to the fact the main russian character is a "island unto himself". The film also at times showacases a world where evolution is developing out of a void ocean. yet, there is a allusion to creationism as well. The film a secular piece is a great russian film. The plot is dialouge driven and not "lazer combat powered" like some western science fiction offerings. SOLARIS is more arthouse film than genre, but the moments of beauty are breath taking, like a fine painting or a play written by a master scribe. A thinking persons science fiction arthouse film.

		<shortDescription>A lyrical masterpiece; a thinking person's sci-fi; no cheap thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The novel "Solaris" by Slanislaw Lem is about a planet that is covered by a sentient ocean, a single super-intelligent being that weighs billions of tons, and the human visitors that attempt to make contact. Ultimately the novel is about the impossibility of communicating with alien beings so totally different from us that no common frame of reference exists, and as such it is a profoundly pessimistic book. Tarkovsky's film had to simplify the plot somewhat, but all the essentials are there, and the message is more hopeful that what you get in the book. The film is suffused with a wondrous lyricism that, if you allow it to, will involve you emotionally and leave you drained. The production values are very good (the best the Soviet Union could offer), but there's nothing snazzy about the special effects. This is a very thoughtful drama that poses serious philosophical questions in a very engaging way. There are fine performances by Donatas Banionis as the protagonist Kris Kelvin, Natalia Bondarchuk as his mystery visitor, and Juri Jarvert as dishevelled, defeated Dr. Snauth (he put in a great performance as King Lear in Kozyntsev's Russian version of the Shakespeare classic). Make sure you watch this in a quiet room with no distractions--the haunting effect of the film, including a wonderful classical soundtrack, will be lost otherwise.</fullReview>

Forget all other masterpieces, this tops them all. Each and every performance is of such depth that repeated viewings cannot begin to reveal the details of each frame and moment of Solaris. It is not a difficult movie at all, not by a long shot. It is simple, direct and completely hypnotic. The mystery involved is titillating, the looks on the characters faces priceless, the story as wide open as eternity itself. I have yet to see the re-make, and fear greatly that it will be nothing more than a laughable revisit of an already totally perfect film that asks more questions than it answers while asking of the viewer nothing more than to sit back and swim along with this poetic adventure-a visual delight that takes you from the earth and into space and through the end of your mind.

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking Thoughtful Sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie in 2005, after years of sci-fi stories involving mind-controlling aliens, holodecks, Matrixes, and the like, the notion of an artificial reality created by an alien intelligence seems a bit old hat. BUT ... In 1972, Solaris was groundbreaking, thoughtful sci-fi of a sort rarely seen on the big screen. Yes, Kubrick's "2001" was cerebral and had some similar elements (think of the aged astronaut in the bleached-out white room near the end) and the Star Trek TV series had some mind-control episodes (e.g., the reworked pilot that had the crippled Captain Pike choosing to remain on Talos IV where the alien illusionists could make him believe he was whole and in the company of his beautiful lover), but as a general rule the theme of Solaris had been rarely explored. A few observations: 1) This is a very long movie that, at times, is needlessly tedious (though it's absorbing and engaging most of the time) so try to watch it on a Saturday afternoon when you can stretch out and savor it; 2) This is a film worth watching twice. Tarkovsky loads his scenes with imagery that flow from scene to scene and its hard to catch it all at once. Actually, if you get this on DVD, watch it a third time on 150%. You'll still get the subtitles and the story will seem to make more sense. There are a number of plot holes in the story but, ultimately, they don't lessen your enjoyment because Solaris is not so much about plot as it is about theme and imagery; 3) Some of the stranger elements in the film are explained by production limitations -- some scenes are in brilliant color, others in subdued color and some in black and white. Tarkovsky's artistic intent was shaped by the mundane fact that he had barely enough film to shoot the movie and what he had was a mix of black and white, some mediocre Soviet color film and a little high quality Kodak stock; 4) Finally, Tarkovsky watched 2001 before shooting Solaris and expressly said he intended to make his movie look different, but see if you agree with me that many of the lighting elements, scene compositions, and tracking shots are very 2001-esque.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this Russian's art-house quality-product science-fiction, the genius of Tarkovski uses the music by Bach in an impressive way. The movie is a slow, tragically poetic story of people who are (forced) to life on a strange planet, which is as enormous organism can plot, detect and materialize the subconsciousness of people. Is it unfair to say that this movie is in a way a symbolic portrait of the Soviet-Union of the seventies of the Twentieth Century? A super state, in which a complete inert society has to cope with the remnants of the long term effects of Stalinism, and the problems of organizing an untrue country and the continuing of an society in which freedom of thoughts is defined as a close and permanent danger to the prosperity of the state. Most impressive is the music from the Orgelbchlein (Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ from Chorale Preludes I (Das Orgelbchlein, BWV 639) by Bach used in Solaris. The sober and almost as gently as possible performed Koralvorspiel is in minor and that gives this movie it's utmost apotheoses. I a way I want to think that this music is a prayer by Tarkovski to get strength to hold on in this schizophrenic USSR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only honest Sci- Fi movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do I say that ? Well, Science Fiction itself is a paradox. It pretends to portray the future. It does nothing of the sort - it reveals the present. If you doubt me watch any old Sci Fi movie from the fifties. The cold war, American culture, sexual repression - it is about the fifties, not 3856 on planet Zorg. Tarkovsky is difficult. If you want popcorn go eat it. If you want a director on a par with Shakespeare and possibly the most original film-maker of them all you are at the right place. Tarkovsky realises the paradox above and there are obvious parallels in the film with the decay of Soviet Russia and issues of the '60's. But so much more. Timeless things. For instance, the cosmonauts are tortured by what they are most guilty about. A little girl accompanied by the sound of bells becomes more terrifying than anything in "Alien" because this is about real deep human emotions not goosepimples. The weightlessness scene is truly a resurrection, a scene of intense spirituality such as you would not believe. Tarkovsky works primarily on profound spiritual and emotional levels and if you are not prepared to open up your soul you will not understand what is going on. Also, I believe one has to experience bereavement to "tune in". This sure is no picnic !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Solaris" is not for those with short attention spans. It is quite long and very slowly paced. But the cinematography is so captivating--drawing sharp contrasts between natural beauty and technological ugliness with its dazzling visual imagery--that its length is justified.Surprisingly free-thinking for a Soviet film (and based on the brilliant novel by Polish author Stanislaw Lem) "Solaris" raises deep questions about science and the nature of human consciousness, and lets the viewer draw his own conclusions. Tarkovsky's special effects are possibly the finest ever produced on a shoestring budget, and all the more impressive for being made before the advent of computer graphics. While the acting is occasionally weak, the lovely Natalya Bondarchuk delivers a haunting performance as the mysterious Khari.This is definitely not for everyone, but it is one of the finest and most intelligent science fiction movies ever made, and a very beautiful and moving film.</fullReview>

I'm sure the 99 minute run time will appeal to the more modern audience, but I'm sure it won't have the same feeling.

		<fullReview>I've been reading science fiction since the 1970s and I spend half my time slamming contemporary science fiction movies for being so juvenile and special effects obsessed, so when an actual INTELLIGENT sf movie gets made you'd think I'd be over the moon, right? Well, in the case of 'Solaris' not really. I approached this movie as a Lem fan not a Tarkovsky fan, and therefore I can't help but judge it as an adaptation, not an original work. And as an adaptation it fails. In fact unless you've read 'Solaris' the novel before you watch 'Solaris' the movie you won't have any real idea of what's going on. Visually the movie is stunning and has some absolutely breathtaking sequences, and the acting is excellent, but as much as I try (this is about my fourth viewing over the years) I just can't get into it. The deliberately slow pace didn't really bug me, just that the most interesting bits from Lem were either glossed over or left out. Personally I prefer Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' made several years after this, but for some reason it gets rarely name-dropped and I don't see Soderbergh and Clooney queuing up to remake it. I'd still watch 'Solaris' over 'Star Wars' any day, but if I'm totally honest I can't say it's one of my all time favourite sf movies.</fullReview>

Mostly, I am tired of reading of reading about what a great MASTERPIECE this movie is.The emperor ain't got no clothes, and if this is a masterpiece then I'd like a good look at what would be considered a debacle.About five and a half minutes of the movie is a drive through a 1970s Japanese city, mostly with the camera in the front seat pointed forward, the rest shots of the occupants, not even talking. The car seems to be driving itself, but we aren't allowed to see it because it doesn't exist. The purpose of all this is to project an "image of the future" to give the film its futuristic setting. It has no other point and nothing to do with the story. It might have been impressive to some potato serf in outer Plotovitzicks that have never seen an elevated freeway, but I'm sure the citizens of Moscow must have been scratching their heads, let alone us.Ok, ok. I understand that the director had a limited budget. There is some truly beautiful camera work in this movie, and it has a presence and style that is hard to define but leaves an impact. Yet there never seems to be any reason to care about the characters, and like the book their motivations remain almost totally obscure, except for the obvious desire of the central character wanting to see his wife again. The closest we get to having a real character to study is when the 2nd fake wife decides to take matters into her own hands (can't say what without doing a spoiler). Other than that, nothing.Here is what is really interesting. Get the DVD and turn on the commentary track. The English speaking film critics point out a lot that is worth hearing, like the various compromises that had to be made to satisfy the 30 bureaucrats that had censor and budget authority over any film made in Russia. Also there are some comments about culture a Westerner would not know.Without that context, this film is almost worthless. Stop kidding yourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this moldering museum-piece of Soviet cinema back in the 70s; even then it seemed clunky, ponderous, and naive. (The "futuristic" city has freeways and tall buildings?wow!) Rewatching the movie on DVD (an excellent transfer), I see now what I didn't see then: how slavishly it tries to mimic Kubrick's 2001 (the theme of first contact, the deliberate pacing, the overloaded soundtrack, the attempt to evoke a sense of wonderment and to probe high concepts); but Tarkovsky lacked the resources, technical skills, and artistic vision of Kubrick, and the result is very flat.Tarkovsky did not lack for great source material?the remarkable novel by Polish author Stanislaw Lem?but he couldn't summon the special effects know-how to reproduce the phenomena of the planet Solaris, or the writing skill to transfer Lem's mind-blowing ideas to the screen. There's a lot of pretentious dialogue, with characters namedropping Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy; if only the director had been as respectful of Lem!The later Soderbergh version of SOLARIS is essentially a remake of this movie, not a fresh interpretation of the novel (probably Soderbergh didn't even read the book). Soderbergh's movie is more successful then this one, but still falls woefully short of giving us Stanislaw Lem on the screen. The best Lem adaptation is still THE SILENT STAR from 1960. Lem later disowned his early novel (THE ASTRONAUTS) on which that East German film was based, because of its outmoded socialist optimism, but despite its na?vet and dated special effects, THE SILENT STAR nevertheless has moments that capture the genuine sense of awe that Lem could evoke so strikingly in his unique novels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The entire theme of the film is based on what is right and wrong. The messages are not clear but depicted in a superficial way. You need to be entirely concentrated all the time to understand the film. It is almost likely that you will get bored. But stay patient and things will get interesting slowly. The story is about a situation when mankind has discovered something beyond their potential and now it is up to them to continue their research or abandon it in the name of humanity.PROS: Though in the starting it was not clear what the film is suggesting, but it had a vague feeling that the plot is promising. How would you react when you have discovered something which is beyond your understanding and you need to decide how to approach further? There was confusion even until the half time but even then this curiosity to know the end, keeps you seated. The good thing is that the process of creating confusion was so smooth that you will feel a strange feeling to focus more and more until you know everything. The second part is faster and more exciting than the first. Interesting things keep on happening all the times and whether you understand them or not is not a question. The close angles at most of the times were very effective.CONS: The acting by the cast was just average and nothing too interesting was done by them. A big loss was the lack of proper technology for the visual effects. The film had a lot of potential for them. The first half is excessively slow.MESSAGE: "Sometimes it is better to stop going further." VERDICT: "Put on your list."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another work of art by the genius Tarkovsky, Solaris. There since has been an American remake with the very famous George Clooney, although I find Tarkovsky's to be in a whole other league of films. Like many of his films, Solaris without ever saying to much, can really make you think and dive deep into the story. It is extremely easy to get lost into the story and I found myself many times trying to answer the questions that are brought up in this film.I have heard many describe Solaris as a close relative to Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in the Criterion version of Solaris, Akira Kurosawa states that Tarkovsky found 2001 to be "cold and sterile." Even though 2001 is a wonderful film, Solaris is filled with so much more human emotion, grief, love, hate, etc, where as for me, 2001 concentrated more on the hard science aspect of the film. I wonder if this could be the reason Tarkovsky wanted to make Solaris, because he wanted to do a science fiction film correct in his eyes? Regardless of why he did it, Tarkovsky himself ended up not enjoying it, and became his least favorite film to make.Much like Stalker (1979), this film is not filled with much hope. From the moment the film begins in the prologue, we see that our protagonist, Kris Kelvin, is upset and filled with grief. It seems as if his trip to the Solaris station is more of an escape rather than a mission for his work. Kris wanting to leave earth is the main reason why some of the scenes in the opening of the film might feel like they drag on, but that was done for a reason. It is Kris' final day on earth, and this could very possibly be his last. Tarkovsky was showing off nature to the viewers as if it was our last day here. He was wanting us to take in every leaf blown in the wind, every cloud in the sky, and even when Kris arrives at the Solaris station, the other Solaris' most missed possession is the wind.As the film progresses Kris begins to learn that the reason he was sent here is not so far fetched after all. The planet they are orbiting is known to harbor some sort of intelligent life, whether it be physical or just biological. The intelligent life somehow can understand what is in your deepest part of your conscious and actually reveal that to you. The intelligent life teaches us that the reason Kris is filled with so much grief is because the loss of his wife. So of course the second day that Kris is on the Solaris station, the intelligent life brings to him his wife. To some this may seem like a miracle, but as Kris slowly finds out, it is only going to bring him more grief. Kris' wife, Hari, still remembers everything, including her suicide. She wrestles with the idea that she is not the real Hari, but a duplicate created by Kris' imagination.Solaris has one of the most conflict filled love stories, and is told so well through the experiences that each of the characters go through while on the Solaris station. Kris has to constantly struggle whether to leave the station forever and never see Hari again, or to forever stay there and live with the "phenomenon" Hari, because the moment they live the orbit of that planet the scientific phenomenon vanishes. My favorite line from this movie, and one of my favorite quotes of all time is said by Dr. Snaut on the station when talking about what is actually going on in the planets space ocean."We don't know what to do with other worlds. We don't need other worlds. We need a mirror. We struggle to make contact, but we'll never achieve it. We are in a ridiculous predicament of man pursuing a goal that he fears and that he really does not need. Man needs man!" Dr. Snaut is trying to tell Kris, that even though there is something mysterious and powerful going on in this planet, we do not need it. We were put here on earth to discover other humans, to get to know our fellow species better. We do not need clones of the ones we used to love to make us happy, that is why we have memories. Dr. Snaut is telling Kris to go back to earth, back to his family, and try and get to know new people, that is what will relieve Kris of his grief.For those who have not seen this film, you must. If films like 2001 bore you, than I guess watch the remake because it is a much shorter film, but there is a reason for that. It leaves out a lot of really great scenes between Kris and Hari, and from what I recall the ending is nowhere near the same. The ending to Tarkovsky's Solaris is one of my favorite endings, it stunned me the first time I saw it. I honestly don't think I have ever been disappointed by a Tarkovsky film, but Solaris is my favorite from him.</fullReview>

Nonetheless, it is one of the more watchable Russian sci-fi films, and people have often compared it to "2001-A Space Odyessy" (though I fail to see any resemblance). The story centers around a makeshift colony set up on a watery planet. Everyone who's been there has gone insane-or have they??

		<fullReview>Stanislov Lem's Solaris sci-fi novel is one of my favorites. It dwells on the gap between our material technological world and our spritual world.If you have not read the novel, the film may seem to be overly long if you are expecting the usual blow things up in space opera.I found the extended driving scene through the typical urban freeway hell to be a funny joke that suggests that a mundane auto commute is just as dangerous, toxic and tedious as very long space voyages.The use of a life form that can read ones thoughts and feelings is not new. What the life form does with this is surprising and very loving. It can somehow materialize the physical objects of your deepest desires. Much like C. S. Lewis's "The Great Divorce" it shows how people can choose between Heaven and Hell at any time.The space station set is convincing, but most of the special effects are pretty cheesy. Fortunately the focus of the movie is not on these but on the choices humans make. One has to listen closely to the dialog which tends to be terse and non-repetitive.The beginning committee meeting came off better than the novel and fairly predictive of where earth's bottom line based society is now.I am very surprised that Cameron, Speilberg, Lucas or some other sci-fi heavywieghts have not scooped up this story.</fullReview>

Watch it as viewing another world of place and time.... The plot concerns a scientist who goes to a Russian space station orbiting the planet Solaris, to investigate why one of the crew members went mad and killed himself. After he arrives at the station he realizes Solaris has a enigmatic, vast fluid ocean that can materialize dead humans of the cosmonaut's past. Soon his dead girlfriend appears on the station, and he starts to question his own sanity and the awesome, puzzling nature of Solaris. Honestly this science-fiction film is like no other. Most of the film is dialogue of the nature of love, exsistence, and death. You really feel like your in a beautiful, metaphysical dream of the unknown.

I still do not understand all the implications and meanings of the film, except to strongly indicate that Solaris has great depth, and that at least the most obvious themes can be accessed in the first viewing. I must caution that the film is long, and there are a handful of long, panoramic scenes that are redundant, even boring... I must also warn that an organ piece by Bach is a central theme of the film, and so the soundtrack is either sublime or annoying depending on your tastes.... if you enjoy Tarkovsky, try "Andrei Rublev."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film that drew me in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie today, for the first time. I didn't know what to expect -- I had read a review of it on a web page devoted mainly to 2001, and it looked intriguing. The box said something about a "thriller", though, and I was afraid it would be more of a horror film than anything else. Since I don't like horror films, that would have been bad if it had turned out to be true.I have heard complaints, as with 2001, of the length of this film. Maybe it's a difference in what I am used to, but if I can stare out of a car window at a rarely-changing and familiar landscape for three or more hours, I can watch a movie for three hours.There was something to the feel of this film that made it very easy for me to get into it. The fragmented views of scenes, jumping from one angle to another, the tendency of anything looked at for long enough suddenly filling the whole field of vision, and the overwhelmingness of water and the ocean; all those things made me (as someone with Irlen syndrome, a visual-perceptual disorder with very similar visual effects) feel right at home. I'm sure there were many aspects of the film that were more universal kinds of metaphors -- the ocean could be one of them.This film drew me in, and presented me with a lot of images, thoughts, and feelings that I can't put into words. There was something beautiful about the whole thing, and something dreamlike -- I often felt as if I were dreaming while watching it. The use of sound made the dreamlike quality more apparent.I don't know what "category" to put this movie into. It was in the "foreign" section of the local video store, I thought it would be science-fiction, but it said "drama" on the case. I'll leave that to the video store people. I don't think it really needs a category.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes science fiction, wants to think a lot about things -- everything, really --, and isn't afraid of things because of not being able to name them. I suppose a tolerance for long movies should go in there, although it didn't strike me as long. I have watched comparatively short movies that seemed a lot longer, and which I have had to give up in the middle of out of lack of interest (I would rather have been staring out a window at nothing) or sheer embarrassment.I loved this movie, in a quiet and reflective sort of way. It is indelibly incorporated into my mind now, probably just as intended by the filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful exploration into the nature of consciousness....long and poetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not made with the contemporary attention span in mind. Tarkovsky seemed hell bent on staying true to a vision of exploring ideas of human relationships and consciousness. To communicate deeper multi-layered philosophies, Tarkovsky takes his time setting a pace that is as slow and deliberate as is the payoff for sticking with this film to the end. The ideas Tarkovsky is working with would seem to be better suited to a book format (and amazingly enough, in my opinion, the movie is better than the book the film is based on) yet he uses the medium of film successfully. I was profoundly affected after watching it for the first time and it has been a film I've gone back to regularly over the years. This is by no means a movie to sit down and expect to be entertained. If you don't engage it and consider what is being presented you will most likely not enjoy the poetic and philosophical elements that elevate this film to high art. And though art is subjective...make no mistake..this film is high art...it just may not be for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>to simply evaluate art or film as a base articulation of ideas that may or may not be successful is an ideological abstraction. for in that respect it is impossible to judge whether it is 'successful'....how can one know what anothers ideas are without them being articulated? one would have to be a mind reader to subvert the mediumistic dialogic nature of film or art. So how could one know? barring supernatural powers one can't. one has to invent an abstract perception of what the filmaker/artist ideas might be..... why judge things on perceptual abstractions when one is going to be mistaken on every account and fail to notice how it functions? Does 'Solaris' funtion as engaging dialogue? i thought it did...be very wary of anyone judging, authoritatively the effectiveness of communicated intent or any so called authority on what 'intellectual naivety' is or isn't.in my opinion great films allow much room for the viewers own reactions and interpretations of meaning.why watch anything to have the conclusions drawn for you? that's what makes Solaris a great film. there is a puzzle presented that the film doesn't solve.</fullReview>

Solaris, however, stands to Bladerunner as Bach cantatas to Salvation Army hymns: a profound meditation on what it might mean to be a man. Bladerunner takes the women-as-alien premise and makes a romance; Solaris uses it as a wedge to open up more interesting things: consciousness, desire, endurance, fidelity -- y'know, love: man and wife, father and son, boy and dog, comrade and comrade. what maybe makes the whole business worthwhile....Transcendantly humane.Gotta be careful, because two cuts exist. One is a totally butchered 90-minute thing with scrambled reels, partly dubbed, occasional subtitles -- a senseless botch, somebody's idea about a low-grade cheapo sci-fi movie in 1973. The other is much longer, well over two hours, and surpassingly graceful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarkovsky's Solaris is a twin of Kubrick's 2001: slow but thoughtful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ATTENTION IMDb EDITORS: I have tried not reveal or spoil the end of the movie for those who did not watch it, but if you think I have spoilt it, keep the "spoiler" warning. =======================================Why is it so good? You must watch and see the end of the movie to understand why is Andrei Tarkovsky's vision of the Stanislaw Lem's novel truly amazing in several aspects. First: It takes some time to comprehend what really happens in the novel, written by a scientist deeply convinced that humans will never find another intelligence in the Universe, although Lem did his best to prove otherwise. Second: Tarkovsky did not focus so much on strangeness of the Solaris as much he did on human psychology. As not seen in either of the two Solaris screen versions, but was beautifully described in the novel, the planet is an emotional child trying to fulfil wishes of its visitors, who are themselves emotionally adult but have serious fears and regrets of their past deeds (only to expressively shown through Hari character). Third: Andrei Tarkovsky has had a very specific visual language: he used colour as an expression of emotions (Watched "Andrei Rublyov"? It's full-length B/W until the very end when colours speak or should we say scream from the screen). Then, the atmosphere at the habitat is skillfully blended into the movie: loneliness, lack of communication, silence, boredom, day-dreaming, philosophical questioning of everybody and everything. The only true special effect scene in the movie is the passage through low gravity, when Kris and another reproduced "Hari" stay together. One important element of the Lem's story was blissfully ignored both by Tarkovsky and Steven Soderbergh (2002 version): Solaris came to be intelligent ocean because its two suns (a red giant and a blue dwarf) have prevented formation of any other form of life. Four: to tell an introspection story in attractive way was hard even for Soderbergh who had much advanced technology 30 years on. Five: the very ending scene in the 1972 movie reveals how unfathomable is the world of Solaris: Kris decides to go home, but will he reach his destination any time soon?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this was marketed as the Russian "2001" when released in '71, and it is natural and obvious that Kubrick's film should have influenced Tarkovsky, with not just its cinematic breakthroughs but its important, if enigmatic, themes. However, Tarkovsky in the film admits through a character to being more of a Dostoevskian storyteller, of the unconscious and base, the noble and the delusionary--how the heart is always fighting for supremacy over the intellect and even the soul, which it must follow. "Solaris" is indeed about love and attachment and the eternal need to be close to another human being, and about letting it all go, in dreams and in death. The ending is as brilliant as "2001"s but instead of another leap in evolution, the individual soul labors on toward redemption, understanding, and liberation. (note: I'm grateful that I finally got to see this masterpiece on video the same weekend that Soderberg's film opened (Thanksgiving 2002), elimating what small inclination I may have had to see that one.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly science fiction - watch it again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a piece of Soviet cinema, Solyaris tells us about the culture from which it came - and so that is very interesting to contemplate, even despite our frustrated expectation of the 'science fiction' genre to provide visual effects or to fully recreate the world as it is with one that might be. But Solaris' great achievement is its internal representations, which are stirred by poetic imagery, long panning scenes, &amp; surprising interchanges between characters.When the film does try to evoke a portrait of "future world" by the use of a long driving sequence that takes Burton from his country visit with the Kelvins to the ultra-modern city, we are particularly disappointed (or amused) to note what paucity of reference we are given to "flesh out" the contemporary situation. We see, for example, that in the future people do not steer their own cars. On the other hand cars must be scarce, because there's not much traffic around &amp; it's apparent that the same decades-old (?) models are still on the road in lieu of newer ones. Asian language characters appearing on road markers along the highway may surprise us, but compared to, say, Ridley Scott's new Asian Los Angeles, it is a subtle devise indeed. The technological future, after all, must serve as a contrast to Kris Kelvin's nostalgia that will come to haunt him in space, as well as to the timeless, natural world of the simple country dacha, children at play, horses, rain. So the absence of a convincing science fiction "future world" is troubling to the thematic proposition of this otherwise almost perfect film.As to the slowness, I imagine it would not be in the heart of its contemporary Soviet audience to complain about a slow, prolonged cinema experience if what awaited upon leaving the movie house were more of the same drudgery &amp; hopelessness that was life and work behind the "iron curtain". But, I suspect the director was not merely wishing to opiate the audience. Just as a billows fills with air as you pull at its handles, so do these moments, many of them, fill out &amp; expand even as they are suspended almost beyond reason. I would say that if you watched Solyaris once &amp; found it boring, that you only need to watch it again. Then, if you still found it boring, watch it two more times. Still bored, review it four times again. Eventually, repeating this doubling until you do nothing else, you, too, will find just what it is that makes Solyaris a singular piece of film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to discuss what a masterpiece this movie is. It is a MASTERPIECE. No questions about it. Despite I'd like to comment on some other viewers comments with humble purpose to help those who couldn't make it through the movie...Well.. It is a hard task... First thing is the car ride, which seems to be a break point for most of people. It is NOT a boring scene, with nothing in it. In some sense it is not a scene at all. It is not meant to explain something or to tell you something or anything else like that. This is what one has to keep in mind watching it. Then what it is? Well let's get back to what you've already seen before the car drive... an intro, which prepares you that you gonna have questions with no direct answers given... While modern cinematograph drives your mind with an average of one-two points to ponder, i.e. who is bad? who is good? who has killed? etc. in the beginning of the movie, Tarkovsky gives you a whole situation to think about. Several people-what are the connection between them? what happened in the past? what's gonna happen in the future? The characters are deep and very ambiguios ... just like real people are. You feel like someone who tries to understand the lifelines of complete strangers, who are still close to you or to somebody you know - because this characters are REAL people... Well, where is ENTERTAINMENT here? Why would this be interesting for you??Where is Si-Fi here??? The answer is obvious: In an intro you need to get into movie and became Chris Kelvin - it is not an ENTERTAINMENT although...:) If you ever thought about your own life here you have a chance to think about somebody's life like your own... If you managed to do that you have a ticket to the rest of the movie, which is gonna take you into a very unusual and weird situation- into a REAL ALL CAPITAL LETTERS SI-FI!!! Now, what the hell is the car ride has to do with ALL THAT??? The answer is now close... just wait:) By now you dear viewer performed (hopefully) a very hard thing during 45 min - you've at least partially, became somebody else! But before moving you into intense mind action of the rest of the movie Tarkovsky gives you some time to prepare your new personality by HYPNOTIZING you in a car - it is a HYPNOSIS on the screen!!!-did you see anything like that anywhere else???:)- watch it and let your thoughts be open and slowly moving around... use this 8 min in a car!!! It is a very short time!!! Because eventually this is going to be switched suddenly to a green grass and to you-not sitting on the couch in your room, but being in movie... thinking.. feeling... your last minutes on Earth before going to the weird somewhere... the palce where everything which is called YOU, your whole personality will be blown by the circumstances which you never met before. And YOU are the one who is going to deal with that for more then two hours! If you like to be somewhere in your dreams, where you actually have no chance to be in your whole life - this is your CHANCE to travel there! This is your movie!Well, after watching it over fifty times, I can say that there is a lot more in it. And it is quite impossible to say all the things which I could think about this movie...Just to encourage you- I also like movies with Shwarzeneger:):), it is OK if you too. It doesn't mean you are not able to experience that ultimate pleasure being on Solaris, experiencing all this events... looks and sounds. It is just a very different thing from a usual Hollywood movie, because it is NOT a SHOW! Just try to think yourself different and a miracle will happen:) There will be something in your life after that. Good luck!:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, better novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Getting into Solaris' world without having read the original novel by Stanislav Lem is missing half the value. Despite Tarkovsky's undisputed talent to produce a faithful transcription, Lem's corrosive, ironic view of science and knowledge does not appear clearly in the movie. However, this is one of the best "slow paced" Russian films of the 70's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some memorable photography, an etherial quality to some forest scenes, and a strangely furnished space station. The film has its moments, but not only was it obviously low budget with no special effects to speak of, it really dragged. There is one scene that must last 5 minutes where they are basically driving through city traffic with no dialogue at all. We watched the whole thing, but had to work at it. A great example of cinema produced under the communist regime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple Solyaris (Solaris)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie can be many things for different viewers, as they interpret it using their pre-existing knowledge...(SPOILERS AHEAD)... but quite simply it's the retelling of the most prolific story in modern history. That story is of course Genesis. Take if you will the following pieces? Existence, God, Angels, Eden, Adam and Eve, expulsion from Eden, the Three Wise Men, thinking in circles for meaning, no encompassing answer, getting back to Eden.Take those pieces and creatively disguise them as a moving painting, so as to take away pre-conceptions and allow you to think anew. Plug in the lights and raise the curtain.Watch the drama unfold with discussions of existence and morality, the battle of faith and science, and the force of will from player to player. Contemplate the player's contemplations, till your head spins with unanswerable questions as does their's. Let the trains of thought stretch so far, that you can't see the beginning, nor the end, and that the rules of religion, science, and politics have no practical application. Finally, with no clear answer, start back at the beginning (like our main character), which will hopefully lead to a path with an answer. Step and repeat. "Thought the title said 'Simple Solyaris'? what the (bleep) did all that mean?" Simply put, this is a complete 165-minute contemplation of life. You sprinkle as much or as little seasoning as you like, according to your tastes. Enjoy.(SPOILERS END)Lastly, an additional note for the remake... with a Western point of view, that's more practical and less Eastern mystical, if you get my meaning, I believe the 2002 Solaris remake is just as good as the original. It's not possible to call one better than the other, since they are artistically different and reflect their period of creation. I believe they are equally potent and make great companions, not rivals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a film that such later american projects as THE BLACK HOLE and STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE have given nods to. The film deals with a space station and the appearance of a woman who maybe a time space anomaly or a ghost or a supernatural apparition. The film is a analogy on love life and letting go of lost loves and a chance at renewal in love when all is lost. The film also waxes the poetic at times on visuals hinting at a creationist darwin clash. The film is darwinian in tone. A interesting and thought provoking film shot in JAPAN circa 1970. Of note is one more thing, in space even soviet space heros where monogramed pajamas. SOLARIS is a interesting delve into the psyche and time and space.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Impressive, deep provoking sci-fi classic based on the novel "Solaris" by Stanislaw Lem. A doctor (Banionis) is sent to a spacial station that circulated a misterious planet named Solaris to discover what had happened to the crew. He finds out that the planet is in fact a living inteligence that interferes with the mind and reason of the human being creating images of pleasure, but, sometimes, images of fear and dispair. Tarkovsky - a great Russian director- works here in a very slow pace but the result is overwhelming and rewarding. Maybe one of the most competent and artfully movies of this genre in all time. I give this a 8 (eight).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obviously there's something about Tarkovsky I'm missing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and in this case I can tell what it is: the words. I'm told that in Russian the dialogue is lovely; in the English translation I read, it was boring and flat; half of what people said wasn't translated (the lines that were ignored weren't at all trivial), the printed words were out of sync with the spoken ones, and the metaphysical musings towards the end, which may not have been trite in Russian, ADVERTISED the fact that they were trite in English. Surely it can't be THAT hard to find someone fluent in both English and Russian? If the wretched subtitles on the print I saw are the best available, no English speaker has yet seen the true "Solaris".Mind you, this doesn't fully account for my falling asleep. The thing is, no other director who has ever lived is as good as Tarkovsky at making me want to doze off (to be fair, I had no such temptation during "Andrei Rublyov"). It's not that he's slow. I don't know how to measure cinematic speed, but films like "2001" and "Death in Venice" at least FEEL every bit as slow as Tarkovsky - and for all that, they're riveting. Something about Tarkovsky's rhythms or visual cues or SOMETHING makes my metabolism wind down and my eyelids feel heavy, however much I tell myself that the film is interesting. Perhaps it's just a quirk of my nervous system, like the tendency some people have to sneeze when they look into the sun. (N.B.: I saw "Solaris" once on video and once in a cinema; I fell asleep briefly each time, but during different bits, so I did end up seeing the whole thing.)Clearly, the man's images are beautiful, and (allowing for the mistranslation) this is a fine script; there are even at least two pure, electrifying moments (the one involving the rocket and the one involving the island, not to give anything away). But ... well, obviously I'm not going to trust my critical judgment very far here, given the appalling subtitles, but I note that once again Tarkovsky has decided to mix colour and black and white footage for the sheer, dubious joy of doing so. I'm certain this is a mistake. Many films mix colour with black and white; to my knowledge, only three are successful (each in a different way - the three are "A Matter of Life and Death", "Pleasantville", and, ironically, "Andrei Rublyov"). All the others should stop fooling around and decide once and for all which they are to be.This has not been a review. I doubt that "Solaris" is as great as people say it is - you'd think a great film, especially one so visually attractive, would communicate more of its greatness, poor subtitles or no. But who am I to say?</fullReview>

As a simple sentient of Information Age so used to quick surfing and browsing while taking in sensory assault of all kinds, I find this more painful than a 3-hour mindless meditation.The whole time I fought the urge to doze off or fast forward. The ultra slow pace, repetitive scenes, outdated set design; the eerie silence, annoying organ music; the protagonists in their retirement age... all serve to turn off my appetite.Like a huge puzzle with few clue, however poetic it is or whatever symbolic elements it contains, I've completely missed out and don't really care.This is not science fiction. By putting an alien being into human form, the story leaves no room for imagination. It may be a tale of philosophy, spirituality, or love (the woman representing the never dying human desire, perhaps?...) but nothing about outer space.If it must be compared with 2001 Space Odyssey (which is my all time favorite), the only aspect Solaris would win is the length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adaptation of Lem's Classic Sci-Fi Novel, but Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers Included)In 1961, Polish sci-fi author Stanislaw Lem created a planet called Solaris, which communicates with the Earthlings via physically presented figures who appear in a space station. The figures have appearances and identities of persons who are significant to the target astronauts and scientists, and don't know they are created and sent by the planet. The novel suggests the fragility of human existence in a setting of space exploration; one line from the adapted film says, "Man doesn't want to conquer space. They just want a mirror."This Andrei Tarkovsky's adaptation must have had a huge impact back in the 70s, but unfortunately, it looks fatally dated. The primal reason may be the shift of the world structure since the time the film was made; the all Russian space exploration was only realistic as the "future" from the 70s Russia's POV. The other reason may be acting, which is too sarcastic and dramatic to portray scientists. European "avant-garde" electronic/noise compositions back in the era increase the sense of obsolescence. Several scenes are unnecessarily stretched out, most namely, the scene of the protagonist's meditative contemplation while cruising Tokyo in a cab.Notable artistic merits include occasional long takes that are extremely well-choreographed, and editing that cuts clips immediately after new information appears in the frame--this keeps the viewers busy to reflect the info they just saw, while increasing uneasiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are those who love this film ... probably because they could get a good sleep. There's no suspense - you know the characters aren't becoming insane, because that would make the film pointless. When Kelvin, the lead, sees a woman walking in the station which supposedly only had 3 men in it, you immediately see the resemblance to his dead ex-wife. Like other people have said, seconds turn into minutes, and the ending, just as the beginning were drawn out affairs. I don't think it's beautiful. If the scene appeared for a few seconds, I'd probably admire it, but it stays on screen so damn long that you just want it to go away. I watched this film becausemany people rank it above the new American release, and I thought originals would be better. But I now hope the 2002 version have a different ending, because if it's faithful to the original, I'd be damned for ruining my own viewing pleasure by watching a really bad Russian film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A letdown after a long wait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading about "SOLYARIS" for years, I finally got an opportunity to view it in it's full length recently. I have to say that it did not live up to expectations and the reputation I had read about. I did not glean any deep philosophical meaning from the film, and the highly-touted surprise ending was easy to anticipate.Comparisons to "2001: A Space Odyssey" do not seem justified. 2001 carries a pro-science, pro-technology viewpoint throughout, and SOLYARIS struck me as just the opposite. There seemed to be a strong anti-science (perhaps even an anti-progress) sentiment running through the film.Since I do not speak Russian, and therefore was forced to read the subtitles, perhaps I missed some key plot elements. The subtitles were obviously not a complete translation of the dialogue. I believe that enough of the plot filtered through so that I was able to grasp the major story line.It is a very long film, and there are vast stretches that seem pointless to me. Many elements are introduced and then never explained or alluded to again as the story progresses. Overall, I was very disappointed in the film after having high hopes for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Possible Medium For Tarkovsky?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it's obvious you're in the presence of genius, Andrei Tarkovsky's film of ideas is excruciatingly slow, so slow that you have to wonder why he has chosen film as a medium when print or opera may be a more effective communication method. There's no question that this film (based on a novel by Polish author Stanislaw Lem, unread by this reviewer) about a mysterious planet supplying life forms to occupants of a Soviet space station that replicate individuals from their past is handsomely (if a little cheesily) mounted and Tarkovsky's sharp camera and slow tracking shots are beautiful. But there's so much discourse, particularly in the film's early sections, and so little happens over the course of nearly three hours (just under five full minutes are dedicated to the view from a car windshield) that you begin to wonder why you're watching it and to feel that the whole thing was conceived in a stifling university lecture hall. Though it barely works as a narrative film and seems so rooted in the classics that it's difficult to be considered avant-garde, it does have some compelling themes, particularly the notions that the most identifiable human communication tools are that of guilt and regret and that happiness can only be felt when not dwelling over basic questions of existence. But the rigorous, idiosyncratic vision that Tarkovsky possesses to illustrate his philosophies makes it all seem so ponderous that there's little for the viewer to do but admire.</fullReview>

After a while, I started fast forwarding to find dialog, but even with that, I never finished it. And I don't really care. The acting was good, but I just don't care how Solaris ended or what it was about.A lot of people compare it to 2001:A Space Odyssey, but there is absolutely no resemblance between the two films. I found 2001 riveting when it first came out, when I was 12, and I still find it so today. Solaris is just plain boring, and certainly not "spell-binding" or "amazing" or any of the other superlative adjectives I've seen used to describe it. It's just cheap and slow and mundane. There's nothing beautiful about it. I gave it a 3/10 but now I think I should have given it a 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a horrible movie. I didn't like it, my wife didn't like it and I don't think many in the audience liked it.It may have meanings on many levels, but on the level of entertainment, it does not show us the goods. It is SLOOOOOOOOOOW. How about 10 minutes of film devoted to characters driving on the freeways of Moscow (which actually was a Japanese freeway because you can see billboards in Japanese--guess Moscow in 1971 did not look modern enough). 10 minutes that has nothing to do with the movie. The movie starts with the film showing reeds under water flowing with the current. Even this scene, which should last a minute or two lasted almost 10 minutes of no dialog, and you don't have a clue what is going on. I may be dull or dense, but I need some stimulation in the opening of a movie to get me interested. This director is not interested in getting you hooked on the film. He obviously had no constraints on how much film he could expose, edit, or show on the big screen.The LA Times review compared this space film with the effects of 2001. On a scale of 1 to 100 (where 2001 was a hundred (for its time)), Solaris would rate a 10. There is a very simple space scene, a very simple rocket take off, and that is about it for special effects. There is a view of the Solaris Ocean, but looks more like water spiraling down a drain.There may be lots of subliminal stories going on here, but this movie is sure not compelling or interesting to me (could you guess by this time?). My wife felt like she was watching a David Lynch film as there were unexplained dwarfs, incomplete and poorly executed plot, and just not a lot of story making sense. I sure hope George Clooney can jazz this movie up, because the originial director sure didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solaris is a totally unique film, not quite an "answer to 2001" as you might have heard. It is immaculately crafted, but that may be its principle problem: it feels labored, strenuous, and overbearing in its near-3-hour running time, so much so that it seems to lack genuine force or momentum. While certain sequences certainly are fascinating, and the unique production design (bringing to mind A Clockwork Orange, and other early-70s avant-garde pieces) is at times startling, the entire film feels bogged down in its sci-fi pretensions, rather than being driven by them. Tarkovsky really, really loved exploring the realism vs. fantasy aspect in this outing, and his curiosities sometimes gets the better of him: some of the long takes are 8 or 9 minutes long! That being said, Solaris' uniqueness and limitless imagination demands that you at least give it a chance; it also boasts one of the most unforgettable closing shots in film history.

There are things I both like and dislike about this film. On the surface it's a sci-fi film involving space flight and strange inexplicable events. However underneath it as an introspective film about relationships and humanity. In that respect there is also an obvious correlation between this film and Kubrick's 2001. Amalgamate the 2 films and I believe a synergistic masterpiece would be in the making. On their own however I regard both as butt-breakers that would try the patience of a replicant.Pros - Excellent premise that is reworked from Lem's novel.

		<fullReview>This film is so typically Russian. It is incredibly slow paced and frankly, when seen thirty years after its creation I found that I felt I was in the middle of a narrative for which I knew no back story. The film is clearly laden with symbolism pitting nature against technology as well as dozens of other vague allusions to immortality, loss, grief, love and desire.All of this is presented, however, in a cloudy, non-literal way. As much is unsaid and murkily implied in the film as is said. Details are either not specified or missing completely and much is totally not explained at all.I left the theatre and made a list of over twenty questions the film never even attempted to answer. Frankly, it was a little frustrating.Kelvin, the main character, for example, just seems to take it all sweatily in stride when encounters his wife who has been dead for ten years and falls in love with her, or the her this duplicate has become. We never actually see the other two scientists "Guests" for any more than a passing shot which is unfortunate. Other details are completely not provided either, such as to exactly why the third remaining scientist has killed himself.Overall, the film is very "Fellini" in its oddness and if you are looking for clear-cut answers, watch another film. In an era of fast-paced action films, this one stands out for its slow approach and leaden pacing. It is watchable though and I am glad I saw it in counterpoint to the remake of a few years ago, which was much more Hollywood. The interesting thing is, when seen together, they complete the story much more perfectly than either do individually. It made me want to read the 1961 book upon which the movie is based.</fullReview>

Unfortunately many directors in the 1970s were still experimenting and just didn't have their techniques perfected - with their films having long slow scenes which go nowhere. If people have only seen crap movies then this might be a breath of fresh air, but sadly there are too many good movies to watch to put up with this snooze-a-thon. Yes, I fell asleep too and bitterly resented my time wasted when I saw it at the local Film Society.Interestingly, the local student radio station allowed listeners to vote for a movie to watch on DVD at the local large-screen cinema and bewilderingly this turkey won.

In fact Soderberg's 2002 remake SUFFERS from its very brevity. It is not BETTER than 2001 it is not inferior......it is simply a film without equal by virtue of its inexhaustibly contemplative issues. SOLARIS takes place in your mind, just like Chris Kelvin's.

		<fullReview>This is one of the stranger films I have ever seen and although I have seen several other Russian films and was not entirely put off by the amazingly slow pacing, I was left wondering whether or not I even liked the film! The film starts on Earth. It's supposed to be in the future, but how far in uncertain. What is certain is that the homes and dress look like the 1970s--not a Hollywood or European film view of the 1970s or the future--just the 1970s. At this point, the audience is confused, because although you don't know the year, the entire context for the film is missing--things just ARE and the film moves as if the audience somehow knows what is occurring and what has occurred.What slowly becomes apparent is that there is an Earth space station in orbit over some planet. Additionally, some mystery surrounds the base and bizarre reports of things happening on the supposedly barren surface alarm some and don't seem to matter to the protagonist in the film, Kris Kelvin. He then goes to Solyaris to investigate but seems to have little emotion or motivation.Once there, he soon realizes that the two remaining people on the station and himself are subject to bizarre contacts from the planet below. Instead of contacting them by radio or telepathically, a unique person from one's past appears to each of the three--though the only one you really see in more than glimpses is Kelvin's deceased wife, Hari. Now you know and the rest of the audience knows that this can't be Hari. Even if she were alive, she'd be back on Earth but somehow Kelvin is so captivated by her that he refuses to believe she isn't real. While she MAY be real, it is certain she ain't Hari! Despite Kelvin's desire to just lie around and enjoy reminiscing and sleeping with Hari, the other two scientists somehow think this is a bad plan, so one of them comes up with an incomprehensible plan to use Kelvin's EEG pattern to stop the transmissions from the planet. How, exactly, he came up with this plan is really vague, but at the end of the film, the apparitions on the space station stop and Kelvin decides to go back to Earth. But, in an excellent twist, you are left wondering exactly WHAT happened.Despite my liking the ending very much, the basic premise and some of the lovely cinematography, the end product was a very mixed bag. The film was meant to be an artsy film and often spent WAAAAYYYY too long on scenes that should have been shortened in order to keep the audience awake. Now I do like longer movies and a 3 or 4 hour film isn't daunting to me, but this film should have had at least 1/2 hour taken out of it. Too many scenes show close-ups of weeds moving in the water, cars driving for 5 minutes along a highway in Japan (pointlessly, I might add) and people staring off into space. Now some of these excesses didn't surprise me (heck, I've see the Russian version of WAR AND PEACE twice--and it runs more than 6 1/2 hours in the American version), but that still didn't excuse the overly long shots. Had this not been an "art" film, critics most likely would have torn apart the film for this reason. I truly think that had it been only a 2 hour movie, it would have been better and I would have scored it at least an 8.This one is like watching a film marathon. A pretty good film marathon, but a marathon nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes you feel you were not in a condition for the movie you had just seen. Solaris was to be shown here, on Earth. Fancy, not to far from my home and my phone. I had heard Tarkovsky was some kind of a fashionable author those days in Paris, especially with cinema students. It was a sellout. About 500 people for what is the most cerebral movie experiment I ever attended.Among the disturbing movies I couldn't criticize point-blank once back in the breeze of real life, Persona had at least a steady unity. Solaris is more a patchwork of nice pictures and philosophical dialogue.I read somewhere that Tarkovsky did this because 2001 had left him craving for more meaning. There is too much and there is enough. 2001 is a great show. Solaris is tiring. Kubrick was a cerebral type but he translated this in pictures that read his mind; then it is up to audiences to seize only the beauty of images or the meaning within. This is art. Tarkovsky doesn't know to articulate his ideas with nice pictures. That is intellectual naivety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly slow and dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A psychologist is sent to a space station orbiting a distant planet to find out why the whole crew went insane. While there he slowly (VERY slowly) something is wrong.I caught this at a revival theatre years ago. I heard it was long and slow but I sometimes like movies like that. Well it WAS long and slow...also boring. There's nothing wrong with a movie taking it's time to get started BUT you should make sure to give the audience something to think about or ponder and not just expect them to patiently wait till you're ready. The first hour of this was a real chore. I was fighting to stay awake but eventually lost the battle and did doze off. It did start moving after that but (again) it was slow and uninvolving. I will admit the final shot gave me chills but it was too little too late. Slow and boring does not make a movie a masterpiece and we're not too dumb to get it. It's slow and boring--that's all there is to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was This Supposed to Be a Comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard of the Russian sci-fi flick "Sol(y)aris" for years but never got around to renting the video until I learned of the impending remake with G. Clooney, at which point I figured this would be a good time to get to it. (It's strange seeing the remake before the original, as in my case happened with "Get Carter.") So I contacted the always reliable Facets people in Chicago and when TWO videocassettes arrived and I saw it was almost three hours long, I thought "Uh-oh." My previous experience with a Russian epic had been "War and Peace." The Russians seem to feel that "translating" a novel to film means rendering it word for word and image for image. At least "War and Peace" had battles and other things going on. "Solaris" has mostly dialogue---lots and lots and lots of dialogue.I haven't read the novel, and I probably won't, so I'll have to take the word of those commentators who say it's great. I knew roughly what it was about, and the premise sounded a lot like Kubrick's "2001." As "Solaris" began, it reminded me of "2001" right off: Kubrick always liked to start slowly, and the pace of "Solaris" was almost glacial. The footage of Russian fauna and flora went on so long that I guessed the director was trying to convey visually something that had been spelled out in the novel. But a movie's not a novel. When after about half an hour we actually had some dialogue, it seemed the brooding protagonist was about to go off into space to join with a rogue shuttle. (Why the government would send just one guy, and a shrink at that, was never particularly clear.) As his parents gloomily watched him burning his papers, I assumed it must be some kind of suicide mission.The movie stopped dead again during an endless cab ride. Visually it was impressive with the mobile camera and the alternating light and shadow, but I was viewing it as a nicely filmed sequence, not part of a story. (The director kept switching between black and white and color, likewise distracting one from the story.) It was the trip itself that made me begin to think this was supposed to be a comedy, partly due to the bare-bones budget: we see some stars, the guy's face turns sideways and then ZAP, he's inside the shuttle. The shuttle was supposedly hovering over a planet outside our solar system, right? How long did it take him to get there--months, years? Was he in "hypersleep" or something? Anyway there he is in the shuttle which on the inside seems vastly larger than what the one exterior shot had indicated, and where weightlessness apparently is not a factor, except for one brief scene in which a few items levitate as in some poltergeist movie.POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW **** POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW *****The protagonist roams around a while seeking the crew. It seems there are only three of them (a little understaffed?) and one of them is dead. The others behave more than a little eccentrically. We eventually learn why when the hero's dead wife appears. This wasn't much of a jolt since we had seen her picture back on Earth AND we had seen the video with the currently bald astronaut describing visions AND the crew had hinted at strange things occurring. The scenes between the guy and his wife should have been the most moving in the film, but the actor seems stuck in his catatonia and the director goes for slapstick: the shrink promptly shoves her into a rocket and blasts her off--I guess they didn't need that rocket for anything else. She just as promptly reappears, after which the four of them get together and mostly talk. They talk so much that I was reminded of not just Kubrick but of Sartre's play "No Exit," where the characters are in hell, can't leave &amp; thus have to stay and talk. In this case the characters are on a spaceship, can't leave and have to stay and talk. There was a lot of talk about Mankind and Existence and so forth but since it was in Russian with subtitles I mostly focused on the actors themselves who seemed intent on deadpan irony. The actress in particular was very good but I kept forgetting the character had only just started existing and wasn't sure who she even was. The promising issue of the shrink's guilt and his "second chance" with his dead wife seemed to get buried under an avalanche of verbiage. Then the ghost (or materialization, or alien, or whatever she was) managed to commit suicide (like her Earth counterpart) and we seemed to be back at square one. Then lickety-split the shrink was back home (leaving unresolved what would happen with the shuttle, or it's remaining crew, or the mysterious planet with the psychedelic ocean) gazing at fauna and flora again. Others have commented on the movie's closing shot with the camera pulling endlessly back and, again, it was visually impressive, albeit not entirely original; as I recall, "The Incredible Shrinking Man" had a similar ending.This is one of those "Spanish inn" movies where what you see is basically what you brought with you. If you love to hear people talk (in Russian with subtitles) about supposedly profound themes, maybe it's for you. (I prefer such scenes to have a sinister edge to them, such as in Pasolini's "120 Days of Sodom" with the decadent Fascists quoting Nietsche and the Bible as they take a break from sex and torture.) If you like sci-fi in general and don't need state of the art special effects, maybe it's for you. If you enjoy quirkily tour de force performances, maybe it's for you. I'll admit the music was great, very atmospheric and effective, it almost carried the whole movie along with it. But I'm glad I saw it, if for no other reason: now I very much want to see the remake, because there's the essence of an emotionally involving story there, and I trust Mr. Soderbergh to extract it, plus extracting the best from Mr. Clooney. It's only when Clooney works for Soderbergh that he makes me forget Doug Ross from "ER."P.S. The movie could also be enjoyably viewed as a tongue in cheek comment on the historically shabby state of the Soviet/Russian space program in general. Basically they "shot their wad" with Sputnik, downhill from there until they're reduced to charging millions to give rides to celebrities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, this movie is too slow and is too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like movies that make you think. I like movies that were made with substance, story, acting, etc. being more important than action or special effects.I tried to like Solaris. I really did. But it was too slow. It was too long. To those who tout the slowness and length of the film as brilliance, I say hogwash. I found that the extra long time for many of the scenes made the movie more painful to watch. I do not believe that these scenes conveyed any more meaning or cause for thought than if they had been half as long. Many mention the long car ride scene. I would and the scene where the camera panned the winter painting for what seemed like a half hour.One or two drawn out scenes may have been okay; but every other scene taking forever was more of a hindrance to enjoying the film.I do think that there are good elements to the film. I thought the story was interesting. I did like the acting. It did make me care about the characters and what was happening to them.Unfortunately I believe that the extreme slowness, the extreme length and numerous unexplained, confusing elements (the dwarf? the switching between color and BW) distracted from what could have been an awesome film.I'll bet the novel, which I haven't read, is a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long slow film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a long slow film and not very much happens. yet the film is a good film though it did become a little boring in parts. 2001 is a very similar film but also very different. This is also a space epic but not as 'epic' as i had hoped for. Overall i would say that Solyaris is the weaker of the two. Worth watching, but Solyaris is not for the casual moviegoer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello.......................... Some people thinks thats a dream movie, but think again its a nightmare movie, its a lot of mud in every aspect. Everything in this movie is boring, the history doesn't make sense etc... Don't waste your time... If you want to watch a real good science movie, see The dark knight from batman series. Spiderman 3 or Soylent green. Maybe its the worst film from Tarkessey... Tamara Ogorodnikova was a great actress in Monster movie and I also enjoy The Devils advocate with Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves. In this poor movie its a total disaster... Keep cool and watch real movies (The Dark Knight) heehaws</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I blame Steven Soderbergh. It's because he's remaking this filmthat it is showing for a week here, and I was suckered into seeingit. He's also responsible for Nogawakawakasquatsi being finishedas well,so that's two giant cinematic turds the man had hurled atthe public in the past two weeks, and we haven't even had HISversion of this movie yet.Okay folks, 2001 this is not. Try more like your average originalseries Star Trek episode stretched over 3 hours. Deep philosophical truths? I mean, not to say that what this movie has tosay isn't valid, it's just BANAL. "Oh, the stunning final image thatcontains so much meaning!!!" If you think that, I can only imaginehow the "stunning final images" of the two Men In Black moviesmust have rocked your sockets. I also notice that no one mentions the visual reference toRembrandt's "The Prodigal Son" in the "stunning final image."Sometimes those who say that a film is stupid and boring are notidiot philistines. This film is banal and boring, and if you'vewatched the adventures of Kirk and Co., you've been there plenty oftimes before. Take heed. You have better things to do with your life. I cannot imagine how Steven Soderbergh thinks anyone is goingto sit through another verson of this, unless he amps up thesuspense and creeps a lot. At least we'll have George Clooney tolook at.I often wish someone on here would just write out a analysis of notjust what they think is so great about a film, but how they think itworks and what they think it means. If anyone wants to email meand tell me what I'm missing about this film, my ears are open.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can only assume that the makers of this film were in a typically early 70s altered state when they made Solaris. It is an excruciating experience to sit through. My wife and I watched with 2x fast forward on and it was still unbearable. There are long (5 to 10 minute) scenes where next to nothing happens. The film switches from color to black and white at random for no apparent purpose. What little plot there is in Solaris makes no sense. The acting is terrible. The cinematography is terrible. This is simply an awful movie.</fullReview>
