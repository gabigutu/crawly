		<shortDescription>An early and all-time favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 1960s my mother used to take my younger sister and me to a nearby one-screen theater to see Saturday kiddie matinees. It was a great way to keep us entertained and out of her hair for a few hours, particularly after our baby sister was born.One movie I saw during those matinees was the 1960 version of The Time Machine. It made such an impression on me that, for quite a while afterward, I would play Time Machine with my sister and cousin with me as the Time Traveler.It wasn't until sometime in the 1990s that I was able to see it again when I got a VHS copy. It was very much the way I remembered it to be. I have since read the book and have found that the movie is quite faithful to the text, though some scenes involving two stops in the 1900s were added and a few bright spots appeared that weren't in the book, which is pretty dark.The special effects look primitive by today's standards, but they did win the Academy Award for Special Effects in 1961, and rightfully so, though I have no idea what other films had been nominated.This is still one of my top 10 movies and likely always will be. I haven't seen the 2002 version, which is probably just as well, since I'm happy with the 1960 version and don't want to ruin it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Pal Realizes His Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1960, filmmaker George Pal brought to fruition a visionary concept for a film based on a novel by H.G. Wells, about an inventor who builds a machine that enables him to travel through time, specifically into the future, where he learns a timeless, universal truth about the machinations of society and some of the basic tenets of human nature. `The Time Machine,' which Pal produced and directed, stars Rod Taylor as George, the inventor/time traveler/hero, who, born into a time and world that doesn't suit him, decides to do something about it.  A week into the 20th Century, four of George's closest friends, Dr. Philip Hillyer (Sebastian Cabot), Anthony Bridewell (Tom Helmore), Walter Kemp (Whit Bissell) and his best friend, David Filby (Alan Young), are gathered at his house for dinner, but George is late; when he finally shows up, he is disheveled, disoriented and hungry-- and has a story that is beyond belief. It's a tale that actually began one week earlier, on New Year's Eve, 1899, when the five had last been together. On that evening, George, after a discussion of the reality of a `Fourth Dimension,' had given them a demonstration of a model of a `Time Machine,' he had built, a miniature prototype of the machine he hoped would take him some day into the future.  His demonstration is met with interest, but skepticism; only Filby, it seems, is able to keep an open mind, but even he encourages George to accept the constraints of Time, which to the rational mind are absolute and immutable. George, however, views Time as a parameter; a variable whose value is subject to change. And on that last night of the 19th Century, after his friends leave-- gone off to celebrate the arrival of the new century-- George acts on his theory by stepping into his machine and beginning a journey that will prove to be the adventure of a lifetime. A journey during which he sees a number of wars and changes in the world around him, and which ultimately transports him some 800,000 years into the future, where he finds a world ravaged by fate, where humankind has been divided into two sects: The gentle Eloi, living on the surface of the earth, and the Morlocks-- mutants who dwell beneath as the Master Race, and who prey upon the weak and simple Eloi. He also discovers the dark secret of the Eloi and the Morlocks, and determines to address the situation. But first he returns to his own time, to tell his friends the story, and to retrieve something he needs. When his guests leave, Filby remains behind with words of caution for George; but as soon as he leaves, George is off to fulfill his destiny, and he has all the time in the world to do it. Going into this project, George Pal had a definite vision of what he wanted to accomplish with this film, from the way the time machine itself looked, to the way he wanted to present the future of mankind and the world. And working from the intelligent, imaginative screenplay by David Duncan, he succeeded by delivering a film that has since become a classic of the Science Fiction genre. The nature of the story demands that the viewer suspend disbelief, of course, but Pal develops his story in such a plausible, straightforward manner that it is easy to do just that. He puts George on the journey of a lifetime, and he takes his audience along for the ride. He does an exquisite job of establishing the Victorian era in which the story begins, as well as the world of the Eloi and the Morlocks. The F/X he employs to convey the sense of George's movement through time-- like the swift arcing of the Sun and Moon, and the quick, subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) changes George observes-- are entirely effective. Pal obviously had a devotion to detail that pays off handsomely here. A dedicated filmmaker, he refused to settle for less than what he knew was right for his picture, and it shows. The result is a film that is entertaining, timeless and memorable. As George, Rod Taylor is perfectly cast and gives a solid performance in which he embodies the boldness, the imagination and tenacity of his character. Most importantly, he makes George believable and his motivations credible, which enables the viewer to be swept along with the story. Taylor has a commanding presence that serves his character well, and he is, in fact, the veritable personification of the explorer/adventurer, a man willing to take a chance or face unbelievable odds to accomplish his goal. Taylor is a fine actor who has made a number of movies, but of them all, this is the role for which he will probably be best remembered. Also perfect in her role is Yvette Mimieux, as one of the Eloi, Weena. A talented actress-- now something of a ?60s icon, in fact-- her fair beauty, along with the innocent demeanor and vulnerability she manages to convey, makes her character entirely convincing. And the way she plays it makes George's actions more likely, as well. Granted, her character is well written to begin with, but Mimieux's the one who sells it in the translation from page to screen.  The supporting cast includes Doris Lloyd (Mrs. Watchett), Bob Barran (Eloi Man), James Skelly (Second Eloi Man) and Paul Frees (Voice of the Talking Rings). A transporting flight of fantasy, expertly crafted and imaginatively presented, `The Time Machine' is captivating entertainment that will make you believe that time travel is possible. it paints a bleak picture of the future, to be sure, but it gives you and leaves you with that which has kept Man putting one foot in front of the other since Time began: Hope. That's the legacy of H.G. Wells and the promise of George Pal. And it's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 8/10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, very well done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw the 2002 film "The Time Machine" and liked it a great deal, so I thought that it was probably in my best interest to see the 1960 version of "The Time Machine". So, I went ahead and rented it and watched it. I knew that this film was made in 1960, so I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, but I still hoped that it would be good. I must say that I was REALLY impressed with the film! I thought it was great!The story is brilliantly told, smartly done, and quite interesting. I noticed a great deal of similarities (and differences) between this film and the 2002 version. There was virtually nothing I didn't like about the film, as far as story goes. I'm really interested in reading the H.G. Wells story now, so hopefully in the near future I'll bust out my copy and read it.I thought the actors in the film did a fantastic job as well! Sadly, I'd never even heard of any of the actors in the film. I thought Rod Taylor, Alan Young and Yvette Mimieux all did a great job. The rest of the cast was good, but these three really struck me as great. Also, I have to say that Yvette is one beautiful woman!The special effects in this film were surprisingly good, especially for a movie made in 1960! I must admit that I was really impressed with the sets and the special effects in the film.The only thing that I would complain about, if I had to, is some little things. For instance, the classic "monster about to grab the guy, but then doesn't" sort of thing. Little things like that kind of bothered me, but I realize that it was just the style back then, so I can't really complain about it. Also, I wasn't too terribly impressed with the mouth and face of the Morlocks, but again, given that it was made back in 1960, I can let it slide.Overall, I really enjoyed the film, and would definitely recommend it to anyone that liked the 2002 version of the film or just enjoys films about time-travel or science fiction. I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do. Thank you for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It fired the imagination of a 10 year old boy for a lifetime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so some people are intent on pointing out factual or historical inaccuracies. Some people ridicule the costumes and accents, but what's important is the spirit of the film. I sincerely doubt anyone made the same kind of comments back in 1960. It was a seminal film and must have inspired a generation of film makers. You don't need CGI to make a good film. It's all about the story and the ingenuity of having to make do with the things you've got to hand. This film exemplifies that attitude.I first saw The Time Machine as a 10 year old in 1970 and was utterly captivated. The stop-motion photography was spell-binding to me; particularly when George kills one of the attacking Morlocks. The gory footage of the body decomposing will abide with me forever. More importantly, and for the first time in my life, I was completely swept away with the concept of time travel. This film was unlike anything I had ever seen before and sowed seeds of profound thought for many years after.This film may not be for everyone, but it was for a certain 10 year-old boy all those years ago. How I wish I could go back and recapture those moments...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fourth Time Was A Charm: A Thought-Provoking Film That Looks Better Than Ever On DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, did a nice DVD transfer of this not only mak me appreciate the visuals in here more but made the story seem better, too, for some reason. I only acquired the DVD as a memento, so to speak. I had to have at least one movie which had the woman I had a crush on back in the early '60s: Yvettte Mimieux. She still looks great, too. The main thing, however, is how I now viewed this story and how much more I wound up liking it than in the past. This was my fourth look at this movie over a 45-year span and I enjoyed it the most this last time. Since time travel stories always fascinate me, my favorite part of the film is when "George" (Rod Taylor) is actually in his time machine and experiments with it, slowing it down here and then and then stopping it a couple of times to observe World War I and then WWII. Then, he stops in 1966 when supposedly there was a nuclear attack. (Apparently, scare-mongers back in '60 thought that was a short-term likelihood.)Anyway, when "George" (H.G. Wells, the author of this story) finally stops, in the year 200,000-something, the story loses some of its momentum. However, it's a fairly interesting study of a group of ultra-passive people being dominated by others who live underground and then literally eat the good people. Taylor is astounded that mankind has not progressed as he had figured but seemed to have regressed.The message I got on this last look is that man is still man, meaning sinful and capable of anything bad as well as good, and to put one's faith totally in man is a mistake. It's only going to lead to disappointments as "George" found out on each of his stops. (Notice he never stopped during a peaceful, progressive period.) Yet, "George" is still an optimist and wants to be one to help initiate change for the better. There's always hope for a better world and people like George, with his idealism put to action, can make a difference.Overall, an entertaining and thought-provoking film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's always the right time for The Time Machine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of those Sci-Fi films that's made just right to be watched over and over again and never gets old. The special effects were ahead of their time but the film is not bogged down with them and the actors are allowed to ply their trade. Rod Taylor puts in a solid performance as George the time traveler. George Pal did a great job with this picture. A remake would probably be flashier with the FX but would be hard to beat this classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politically Laundered Sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In isolation, this film is an interesting and rather enjoyable tale. It is only when you appreciate the underlying theme in the original 1895 novel penned by H.G. Wells that you discovers how the story had been "laundered" to be "politically correct" for American public release. In a land where "socialism" has almost always been a dirty word and at a time when the McCarthy political witch hunts (that hit Hollywood rather badly) were still a fresh memory and when the "Cold War" was at its height, M.G.M. Studios was not going to take the risk of preaching a cautionary story about how the seeds sown by the capitalist system could exact a gruesome nemesis in a distant future. Instead, the studio took the story, stripped it of its ideology and presented it as the adventure of a gifted Victorian inventor.Throughout his career, Herbert George Wells (1866-1946) placed his sympathies with the working class. In 1905, he joined the Fabian Society, a socialist think-tank whose ranks included George Bernard Shaw and that gave birth to the British Labour Party. It is not surprising that his ideology would embed itself in his writing -- and this was certainly true of his first novel, The Time Machine. The book tells of an enterprising inventor who crafts a device that can carry a human passenger forward or backward through time. The hero travels 800,000 years into the future and finds a world in which humans had evolved into two species: an illiterate and child-like race called the Eloi, devoid of technology but similar in appearance to modern humans who inhabited the surface of the planet; and the more repugnant Morlocks, technologically sophisticated and living in perpetual darkness in underground caverns. The hero gradually learns that it is the Morlocks who supply the Eloi with food, clothing and other basic necessities of life, but they exact a terrible price. At periodic intervals, the Morlocks "harvest" the Eloi for food.(By his own drive, Wells, who lived an impoverished childhood and became literate only in his teen years, entered university where he studied biology under Thomas H. Huxley, the illustrious and outspoken champion of Charles Darwin. He was aware of the debates among evolutionary biologists of his day over the discovery of Neanderthal remains, about how two "distinct" species of humans -- Neanderthals and our Cro-Magnon ancestors -- existed in a prehistoric Europe and whether it was a peaceful co-existence or whether the two species competed, perhaps violently, for control of resources. Wells merely extrapolated the concept of two competing human species to a distant future.)The hero in the novel also discovers how this world came into being. At some less remote future time, the industrialists collectively chose to establish their factories and means of production underground, leaving the surface of the earth green. Eventually, the politically powerful classes decided to banish all workers underground as well, leaving the world of sunshine and blue skies as a playground for the wealthy and the privileged -- a paradise that would eventually turn sour when the passage of time would adjust the genetic makeup of the two classes in their different environments and when a successful "slave revolt" would place the descendants of the workers in control.Clearly, such a political fable could not be put on screen in the United States in 1960. If a cinematic version of the story was going to be made, another explanation had to be conjured up to account for the evolution of the two human species -- and it was found in the Cold War itself, a war that turns "hot" and forces huge populations underground for survival. Toady, however, almost forty years after the movie was released and more than a hundred hears since the novel first broke onto the world, that M.G.M. explanation seems horribly dated and it is the original Wells plot that holds up much better in today's international, political and industrial climate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The special effects are still remarkable after more than 40 years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well-done adaptation of the H. G. Wells novella, with an Oscar for the special effects that are still impressive more than 40 years later. Good performances by an ensemble cast and a good script also help. One interesting side note: character actor Whit Bissell was in both the 1960 version here and the version done for television in 1978, playing essentially the same part with two different character names!

		<shortDescription>Journey into the far future and danger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw The Time Machine when I was young and is one of my favourite sci-fi movies.An inventor, George develops a machine that can travel through time and he shows the model version of this to his friends to prove it. Despite it disappearing, they don't believe him. He then starts time travelling and first stops off during World War One, then briefly World War Two and then arrives in 1966 and discovers a nuclear war in progress (which never happened of cause). After the nuclear bombs have dropped, causing a volcanic eruption, he travels to the far future where he ends up in the world of the Eloi and the Morlocks, cannibalistic mutations. After meeting Weena and falling in love with her, George helps to defeat the Morlocks and then returns to his own time. After saying goodbye to his friends, he returns to the far future.This has great special effects and a good music score.The excellent cast includes Rod Taylor (The Birds), Yvette Mimieux as Weena, Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot, Tom Helmore, sci-fi regular Whit Bissell (Creature From the Black Lagoon, I Was A Teenage Frankenstein) and Doris Lloyd as housekeeper Mrs Watchett. Taylor and Mimieux were to be reunited in 1968's Dark of the Sun.The Time Machine is a must see movie for all movie fans. Fantastic.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He Has All The Time In The World"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite films back when I was a lad was George Pal's production of the H.G. Wells novel, The Time Machine. As I've gotten a lot older since the 13 I was when it came out, I can more appreciate the meticulous care that went into the making of this film.Considering that we didn't have computer generated images back in the day, the special effects hold up remarkably well. The make up and costumes for the villainous Morlocks still have the power to frighten.What I look at now though was the United Kingdom of the turn of the last century in which Wells wrote his book. As much as George Pal was able to capture the future, he did as well with the past, the recreation of the Victorian/Edwardian era from which our time traveler Rod Taylor goes to the future and back.A lot of that has to do with the casting of the four men who are Taylor's friends and looked like they stepped from that era. Tom Helmore, Sebastian Cabot, Whit Bissell, and Alan Young all comport themselves as proper English gentlemen who are concerned and support their friend anyway in his theories and experiments.Especially Alan Young's performance, it's my favorite in the film. Young plays a dual role as Taylor's friend and as his own son over several generations of the 20th century. He's the kind of true friend we should all in life be fortunate to have.Also note that the mechanics of the Time Machine itself are never explained, just how the thing works and what powers it. It was probably beyond even the fertile imagination of H.G. Wells to conceive, our own best minds of science now debate whether it is even theoretically possible.Rod Taylor after playing several good supporting roles in many films since arriving in America from his native Australia, got his first lead and real big break in The Time Machine. He's excellent as the time traveler who essentially saves the future for mankind and rescues it from the world that has developed.The Time Machine was also ahead of it's time. no pun intended, in its depiction of the peaceful Eloi. During the sixties age of flower power, the gentle Eloi are like a bunch of hippies who seemingly have attained their version of paradise. No one is old and they live in a garden of Eden. Little do they know what the underground Morlocks are using them for.Yvette Mimieux who as Weena of the Eloi got her break out role her. She's the quintessence of the flower power generation soon to come.Even though new versions have been done, this version of The Time Machine still stirs the imagination and appeals to the scientifically curious in all of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original film version of THE TIME MACHINE is almost certainly the best adaption of any of H G Wells work and deserves its status as a classic SF film. That`s not to say it`s without flaws , it starts very slowly and I found Filby`s obviously false Scottish accent very irritating ( Notice when a Scotsman appears in a SF film or series his accent is poor ? Scottie from STAR TREK , Jamie Mcrimmon from DOCTOR WHO etc ) , but once the hero goes off into the future it`s entertainment all the way.Special mention should go to the very intelligent script, it does simplify much of Wells subtext but also adds an anti war theme , you can actually believe the hero`s thought processes came out of the mouth of Wells , and during the nuclear war the Earth show`s its anger at mankind with a series of devastating volcanic eruptions. Is this the first time that " the Gia Theory " has appeared on film ? Perhaps the greatest compliment I can pay this film is that it reminded me of the early DOCTOR WHO stories . Praise indeed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic science fiction film based on known novel and excellently directed by George Pal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fantastic picture is an excellent rendition about H.G. Wells' book, it begins during a friends reunion ( Rod Taylor, Sebastian Cabot, Whit Bissel, and Alan Young who'll have a tiny role in the second version, 2002). Rod Taylor plays a Victorian scientist who travels to far future and he finds several surprises and dangerous happenings. As he invents a travel machine (a real barber-chair) which transport him within the dimensions of time and ahead at future world , into the year 802,701. There meets humanity has been divided in two races , the inhabitants named Eloi who are peaceful, meek and the hostile Morlocks who rule over the good Eloi. There the protagonist falls in love with a gorgeous Eloi named Weena(Ivette Mimieux)but he'll have to confront the Morlocks, a beasts-alike, who bear a light-bulb eyes and hold extraordinary force.This exciting movie is packed with action, adventures, fantasy, a love story and breathtaking scenarios. Glamorous cinematography reflecting splendidly the Victorian setting by Paul Voguel and appropriate score by Russel Garcia. Impressive special effects are deservedly Oscar-winning and perfectly realized by Chang and Warren. Furthermore colorful matte painting and animation by Jim Danforth, though uncredited. The motion picture is stunningly directed by George Pal (When the worlds collide, War of the worlds). It's remade by inferior version for TV (1978) and cinema (2002) directed by Simon Welles (H.G. Wells descendant) with Guy Pearce (Rod Taylor role), Samantha Mumba (Ivette Mimieux), Mark Addy ( Alan Young character), among others and where the starring invents a device to go back in time with the aim to reborn his deceased bride (Sienna Guillory). Rating : Better than average , the picture contains all the ingredients that make it a Sci-fi classic . It's still highly amusing and maintains its sense of wonder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The blueprint for time traveling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films and books dealing with man's desire to travel through time seem to have been around forever. Ever since I was very young, I have always had a certain kind of affection for films that dealt with man wanting to revisit the historic past or zoom off into the unknown and unseen future. My fondness for time travel goes back a long way and can be directly attributed to the first time I ran across this wonderful film by George Pal based on the H.G. Wells novel.Rod Taylor plays George (H.G.Wells), an inventor who has invented a machine capable of traveling through what he calls the fourth dimension better known as time. He explains this to his friends over dinner who understandably scoffs at the possibilities. `If time travel were possible,' one of them asks, `what would one do with the machine? It's not like there are any commercial uses for it.' I guess some things aren't that much different now than they were over a hundred years ago after all. George's best friend David Filby (Alan Young) warns him, `that if indeed George has invented such a machine he should destroy it before the machine destroys him'. I don't know what Filby meant by that and apparently George didn't either or just didn't care because he decides to take a little trip anyway just as we knew he would.And what kind of a journey is time travel as imagined by George Pal in 1960. With a budget of about $850,000 dollars, it's a pretty good one. As George travels, he continually narrates his journey so that we know what his thoughts are as he travels from one moment to the next. With the simple use of time-lapse photography, we see the world changing around George as the years go by first slowly than at a rapid relentless pace. We see the sun and moon rise and set at a breakneck speed. Through the window of his lab, George can see a department store mannequin whose outfit changes from season to season and from year to year. He watches with a bemused look as the fashions change and women's dresses get shorter and shorter. In one amusing moment while considering the situation, George pushes further into the future just to see how far women would go with these newfangled styles. We see dust and cobwebs amass around the empty lab George has left behind. Buildings outside George's now deserted home rise and fall with uncanny precision. It's a memorable trip, and one done without one bit of excessively done fancy showboating special effects. It certainly lends credence to the fact that it's still the story that counts.Since the film was made in 1960, some of what occurs does seem dated. In 1966, a war involving nuclear satellite breaks out that is the beginning of man's downfall. The effects used to show the resulting volcanic explosions and lava that flows through the streets certainly show their age, but one can expect such things when watching a film made more than forty years ago and you just have to overlook them.Much more successful is the sequence where George ends up in the distant future discovering exactly what happened when the wars and man's self destruction finally did subside. It is here that we meet Weena (Yvette Mimeaux) of the Iloi and the Morlocks. The Iloi are a peace loving tribe who bask in the sun all day, and the Morlocks being a vicious tribe of underground inhabitants whom prey on the Iloi for reasons that quickly become evident. The very young and very beautiful Mimeaux is an excellent choice for Weena, as she has an endearing charm about her in the way she relates to George. It also helps that the role doesn't require a great deal of emotional depth, since this was a quality that Mimeaux seemed to lack in many of her later films. Taylor was a great pick for George also. In one of his best roles he portrays George as a man passionate about his ideas and steadfast in his desire to see them through. Yet, when needed, Taylor depicts a George that is every bit a man who is passionate not only about his friends but about the human race and the destiny that awaits us.Just as George Pal has shown us that it's the characters and the story that count, Nicholas Meyers achieved the same type of success years later with the film Time After Time. (See Flack's review). That is what makes great time travel films and no amount of grandiose CGI can compensate for that. And if you make a film about time travel that I can still write about and praise forty-four years later, I have no choice but to give you my grade which for The Time Machine is an A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the two films I am comparing here (Time Machine -2002 will follow), this is the more accurate to the book. Interestingly, Rod Taylor portrays H. George (H.G.) Wells, the author of the novel and the main character in this timeless fiction classic. His guests are Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot, Tom Helmore, and Whit Bissell. The dialog is clear and to the point, and while George relates his tale of time travel, the guests do not interrupt. Given the technology available in 1960, the scenery and settings are exceptional. Photography and Cinematography are excellent as well, and the acting is believable for the story. The departure from the book comes at the end, when George returns to the future to help the Eloi and Weena. An interesting point if the film, which was made for $750,000.00 in 35 days, is that Yvette Mimieux was only 17 years old at the time the shooting began and turned 18 during the filming. Violence is minor and profanity is non-existent in this George Pal classic, and there should be no problem allowing the children to watch. Collectible for science fiction fans and anyone who appreciates pre computer special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When I speak of time, I'm speaking of the fourth dimension.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine (AKA: H.G. Wells' The Time Machine) is produced and directed by George Pál. It's adapted by David Duncan from the debut novel of the same name written by H. G. Wells in 1895. It stars Rod Taylor, Alan Young and Yvette Mimieux. It received the Academy Award for Best Effects, Special Effects (Gene Warren and Tim Baar) for the time-lapse photographic effects showing the world changing rapidly. The story sees Taylor as George, a man from Victorian England who constructs a time travelling machine and uses it to travel to the future. Thru World Wars and on to what awaits mankind in the year 802, 701.We should perhaps start with H. G. Wells the author, the man who broke free from his poverty strewn life to become a social reformer and much revered author. His novel The Time Machine is bleakly dystopian, a cautionary tale about how things will be real bad if things continue on this already rocky path, and also it is a caustic attack on the British class system. Wells was, in short, not crafting a shlocky science fiction page turner to dip in and out of at bathroom time. So it's unlikely he could have envisaged that one day one of his most finest works world be visualised as a moving picture for all the family to enjoy! On to 1960 and the colourful adaptation of his novel, a boys own fable in essence but still retaining the basic spirit at heart.Here in lies the crux of the matter with Pál's movie, well it's two fold really. One is that if you are after very serious sci-fi picture, then you should perhaps know better than to expect it here. The other is that if you are the sort of person who dislikes old film's because the effects aren't in keeping with todays whizz bang special effects? Well you are advised to go rent the 2002 version with the Wells purists instead. Pál has crafted a wholesome family entertainer. Not lacking in creative flair, Pál's movie contains a rich and interesting plot, thoughtful dialogue and a bona fide enjoyable performance from the square jawed Taylor. There's been complaints about the pacing, but I don't see that myself. There's periods of talk and reflection, of course, I mean we surely want some science to go with a story about time travel! While to hurtle towards the finale before addressing thematics in the Eloi/Morlock blonde infused World of 802, 701 would be just plain wrong. Even for a popcorn piece.Away from the charming (not creaky) effects, the set design is pleasant, as is the lost art of model work, while the actual Time Machine itself a lovely ode to Victorian gaudiness. Pál has put his own stamp on a terrific source, his vim and vigour shines thru to give us a smart and perky period piece. For sure it has hokey moments, if you don't laugh once then I'd be very surprised. Whilst in the form of Mimieux's Eloian babe Weena, there's cause for much discussion with the ladies in your audience about the portrayal of Women in the future!! The film has now got a quality DVD release, with a smooth polished transfer, where the colour pings from the screen and the audio is crisper than ever. The latter greatly enhancing Russell Garcia's memorable score. In the extras is a 50 minute bonus with The Time Machine: The Journey Back. Hosted by Taylor it's indispensable, you can see the love and affection Taylor has for the movie. But most of all it's a little vignette at the end of the documentary that fans need to see. What is it? Hah, you will have to buy the DVD to find out. It's worth it, tho, for this is a smashing and charming little movie. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>H.G. Wells' fantasy of time travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rod Taylor boards a contraption he built and goes forward in history in "The Time Machine," a 1960 film also starring Alan Young as Filby, Yvette Mimieux, Sebastian Cabot, and Whit Bissell.Taylor plays George, who is in actuality H.G. Wells, who wrote the book on which the film is based. He's built a strange-looking thing that propels him through space into the future, and on New Year's Eve of 1899, that's just what he does. He watches the store mannequin across the street change styles until suddenly, in 1917, his house is bathed in darkness from being boarded up. Going outside, he meets Filby's son, whom he also meets as an old man in 1966 during an atomic war. Finally he lands way, way into the future and finds a land filled with blond youths who seem to have no feelings. He falls for one of them, Weena, who says she is an Eloi, and he eventually learns about the Morlocks, who live below and control the Eloi.Shot in color and directed by George Pal, "The Time Machine" has some fantastic effects and a good story. Whether it's the story Wells wrote, I can't say. According to one comment, Wells' point was entirely missed. So the film has to be judged on its own merits. All the doom and gloom seen in the future is apparently not new - that's a comfort since we're all still here.The story manages to have the trappings of sci fi as well as being moving in sections, particularly in the friendship of Filby and George. The best part and the best performance belong to Young, and I believe this is his favorite film. He plays Filby, his son, and his young son as an old man very well, the old man having the showiest material. Taylor makes a good leading man. Mimieux doesn't have much to do except look pretty and be passive.Again, going back to one of the comments, the ending is pure Hollywood. "The Time Machine" film, however, is very entertaining. Best not to compare it to the book, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the DVD brings this movie back in all of its original grandeur!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, let me say that "The Time Machine" has been and is one of my favorite movies. I was too young to see it in its original theatrical release, and first became exposed to it when it finally made it to broadcast TV in the the later '60 s. Even on the small screen and with commercials, it still had the ability to fascinate a 10 year old who saw it for the first time. Then it seemed to disappear until the late 1980's when I saw it again on a (defective) laser disc and finally in the 1990's on cable.I purchased the recently released DVD just this week. From the first shot of the MGM logo in brilliant color, and the glorious opening music of Russell Garcia swelling from the speakers of my home theater system, I experienced the thrill that people must have felt when the movie was first shown in theaters. The colors are vibrant and the movie has been restored to crystal clarity. Finally, you can see every detail of George's Victorian living room. At last we can read "Mfg. by H.G. Wells" on the time machine's console. Unlike the truncated picture version seen on TV, this widescreen DVD shows parts of the movie that haven't been seen in years (example: when Philby points to the sky and says "atomic satellite zeroing in" you can finally SEE what he is pointing to).However for me the biggest treat on the DVD is a wonderful documentary about the Time Machine narrated by Rod Taylor. I think the documentary was made in the early 1990's for Turner Classic Movies. You can see that Taylor has very fond memories of making the film (stating that at the end of production that everyone connected with the film had the feeling that they had just made a classic movie). He also has great personal praise for George Pal, at one point doing a remarkable imitation of Pal's Hungarian accent! Thoroughly fascinating is the story of how the design of Time Machine itself was conceived, and it's subsequent history after the movie. Wah Chang and Gene Warren give a great exposition of how the special effects were done. Another little gem in the documentary is Rod Taylor reading a selection from H.G. Wells'original story. But the piece de la resistance comes towards the end. Whit Bissel shows up reprising his role in the movie, and--especially--there is a touching and wonderfully done reunion between Alan Young (as Philby) and Taylor set 25 years after the events of the movie. The script for this scene was written by none other than David Duncan himself, who wrote the script for the movie. This scene brought a tear to the eye and a lump in the throat of this hardened movie goer, I can tell you! I would recommend this DVD to all fans of great science fiction movies, and as an example of a time when these types of movies still made some demand on the intellect of the viewer--unlike the violent and CGI effects-laden "popcorn for the mind" that current sci-fi movies are (including the recent remake of this movie). The original "Time Machine", compared to today's sci-fi movies, proves that the most elaborate computer-generated effects, gory violence, ear-splitting explosions, and MTV-style editing---cannot replace a good and challenging story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sigh, like anyone with half a brain really liked this film(Which would include all you Eloi and Morlocks out there)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I'm goin against the flow here. Everyone thinks to seem this is a cute wonderful little tale. Although I think the film is decent for 1960(you wanna see real special effects and psychological mind numbingness, check out Psycho), it lacks a whole hell of alot. I don't read much, and I'm adamant about not comparing the film to the book, but assessing the film as it's own entity. Unfortunately, when a movie is filled with as many plot holes, inconsistencies, and downright silly plot points as this one, you may find it necessary to refer to the book, merely to try and aid your proccess in understanding the lost potential in this film. The essence of what Wells is saying in the book is sorely missed in the film, as the filmmakers seemed to have solely based the film about the nuclear threat of the late fifties. The Time Machine is nothing about war. It's about people's views toward each other, and how class separation over thousands of generations undermined the great human race into a species of oblivious, mundane, mediocre, couldn't care lesses. Wells does a beautiful job of describing the frailties of both the Eloi and the Morlocks, and does a wonderful job of making a point that they are essentially the same, neither is the bad guy to the other. Both live out of ignorance. Both are innocent as children, and Wells draws strong parallels to these descendants of the decadent aristocracy, and the supressed and opressed working class people, forced further and further beneath the surface. he also does not hint at a hopeful recovery. As the Time Traveller leaves the future, he realizes quite plainly that these are no longer homo sapiens. Possibly some inferior degradation, but their damage has gone far beyond psychological damage that can be reveresed with a mere three books. The only hope for the Eloi and Morlocks, would lie in a change found thousands of years earlier. Therefore it was quite foolish to try and add a "happy" open ending where the vigil Time Traveller is going back to save humanities future. You obviously cannot make the book verbatim into the movie, but you can try and do justice to Wells brilliant observations of the human spirit and behaviour, for surely, there is a brilliant movie with these themes prevailing, just waiting to be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best science fiction movie from the '60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best science fiction movie from the '60s. Based on H G Wells' novel, Time Machine is probably the first movie dealing with time travel. When time travel was not mainstream topic of science fiction, this movie paved the way for interest in time travel, and also sort of gave permission for people to think about time travel, and not be considered a crack pot. Now mainstream physicist write about how real time machines can be constructed without violating the laws of physics. In this sense this movie had seminal influence in the way we think about time.All this probably wouldn't have happened if this movie had shoddy workmanship, but the production of this movie was impeccable. Everything about this movie is beautifully made. Story is intriguing, and also presents an interesting scenario about the future of man kind. Not only is this a historically important film, it's an excellently made movie. If you're a science fiction fan, this is one movie you need to watch.</fullReview>

As a child i watched this on the TV with no understanding of what the film was or that it even existed and it blew my mind , it is probably the fondest memory i have of watching a film.

		<shortDescription>One the best sci-fi films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Pal's The Time Machine was filmed fifty years ago but still remains an enjoyable film to watch. The plot is well known so I won't rehash too much. Simply enough, the movie sees the protagonist, George, travel into the future. After a few stops in the 20th century, being encased in a mountain forces him 800,000 plus years into the future. He meets the Eloi, a peaceful people, and later their captors, the Morlocks. George helps the Eloi, including his love interest Weena to escape from their doomed existence.I often read a lot of criticism of this film. "It's not like the book or the special effects aren't good enough anymore" are the chief complaints. Why does that matter? The movie is fine without being like the book. As far as the FX go. They're fine for 1960 but really, this movie is not about how real it looks but about the characters. And that's where it excels.George(Rod Taylor) is everything a man should be. He craves new facts and strives for knowledge. He also is not afraid to stand up for himself or those he cares for. He freely admits wrong and apologizes for transgressions. In short, he's a great person, almost too good to be true. Rod Taylor plays him perfectly.In the future George meets Weena(Yvette Mimieux), one of the Eloi. The Eloi are passive to the point of complacency and Weena is no exception, but she quickly responds to George. Their romance blossoms but not too much. Most is left to our imagination when George returns to the future at the end of the movie. At first glance it may seem that Yvette Mimieux portrays Weena as a vacuous airhead, but as I watch this movie, I spot a lot of subtle things that make her acting job very good. She is physical with George but it's done subtly, like an innocent girl would do it. For instance, when they go see the talking rings, Weena seems to be very amused with George's curiosity. She laughs, takes his hand and pulls him along. Later she baits him into touching her when she asks him to put her hair up and then turns to him for close affection. Mimieux does a very good job of giving Weena a balance of innocence and budding sexuality.Also worth mentioning is Alan Young as Filby. He avoids the stuffy behavior of the others of George's group and keeps a sense of wonder about him. Young gives a convincing portrayal.When I was a kid my Dad was a sci-fi buff so I saw lots of the old classics. War of the Worlds, Forbidden Planet, and The Thing were often watched by me, but The Time Machine is my favorite. When I saw it as a teen, I was fascinated with a post-apocalyptic future and this movie has that. But when I see it as an adult, I'm more moved by the characters. George has a sense of adventure about him that keeps me interested in him. Of course, Weena kept my interest as a teen and as an adult male for different reasons, but I won't sell Yvette Mimieux short as an actress. She does a great job.See this movie and avoid the cynicism that has affected movie goers today. I know you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the things that used to scare me the most when I was a child was the film, The Time Machine. My sister told me when I was 3 years old that this film just made me cry and scream with fear. So I haven't seen this film since I was a child, but I don't know why I stayed away from it. I watched The Time Machine the other day and just fell in love with it. But I can see why I was such a traumatized child, those Morlocks were crazy scary, even though you could say that this is a bit dated, but it still has such great style and effects. Rod Taylor made such a great leading man, as George he is strong, intelligent and quick witted. The funny thing about this film is that I don't think that the "future" of this film wasn't far fetched, it's funny that the Eloi were just a bunch of air heads, even though you find out why and feel sympathy for them. But they do not read books and just sit there to look pretty, you could call the Morlocks celebrities as they feed off of the Eloi's worshiping them. This is the film that was before "Idiocracy", once again, just not too far fetched and more disturbing when you think about it.On New Year's Eve 1899, a young inventor, George discusses time as the fourth dimension with friends. He shows them a tiny machine that he claims can travel in time. He claims that a larger version can carry a man "into the past or the future". When activated, the device blurs, then disappears. Most of his friends dismiss it as a trick. George heads to his lab and sits in his full-scale model. He pushes the lever forward, and watches time pass at an accelerated rate. He stops the machine on October 12, 802,701, next to a low building with a large sphinx on top. George explores the seemingly idyllic pastoral paradise and spots young adults by a river. A woman is drowning, but the others are indifferent. George rescues her, but is surprised by her lack of gratitude or other emotion. She calls herself Weena and her people the Eloi. As night falls, George is surprised to find out that the Eloi have no government, no laws, and no civilization to speak of. Weena insists they go back inside after George tries to leave, for fear of "Morlocks". A creature that eats the Eloi, explaining their lack of passion for knowledge or goals, they are specifically bred to die. George has to find a way to save the Eloi and get back home finding that this wasn't the future he wanted.The Time Machine has little flaws, the effects are pretty dated, most of the "world collapsing" scenes were obviously smaller sets split in half. Also the make up of the Morlocks could be considered dated, even though I still found them pretty creepy. I still found the film to be very effective despite little flaws that are very easy to let go of. But the chemistry between George and Weena was very sweet but also sad as their worlds are so different, they had a beautiful romance. The story also makes you wonder, we always ask one another if we would go back or forth in time if having the option and The Time Machine questions that notion once again as George sees a very sad future. I think this was a classic film and a great adaptation of the excellent novel. I don't see how anyone could dismiss this film, it's just a great film that I cannot wait to see again. Even to this day I still get the creeps from the cheesy make up of the Morlocks.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a fact that today's young generation have a fairly good idea about "The Time Machine" directed by Simon Wells in 2002.This film was a modest box office as well as critical success although it featured acting talents of screen stalwarts actors Jeremy Irons and Guy Pierce. The film failed to have widespread cultural impact as it contained a wide array of immense special effects.This was not at all the case with "The Time Machine" made in 1960 as its director George Pal was a man whose forte was science fiction.His version succeeded as it did not feature any kind of nonsensical special effects.George Pal contented himself by putting to good use all possible science fiction technology available during sixties.In "The Time Machine",human element is also very much visible despite its primary focus on science and science fiction related matters.The entire film is a symbol of simplicity as roles played by Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux are devoid of vanity.This is one of the reasons why "The Time Machine" remains one of the few films which one can really enjoy on a Sunday afternoon with family on Turner Classic Movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>comic book version of famous story entertains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Time Machine' takes a 'Classics Illustrated' approach to the H.G. Wells book. The characters, dialogue, even the pacing seem straight out of a comic book and taken on that level, the film is very entertaining. The approach is also a perfect fit for producer George Pal and his elaborate if not-entirely-convincing special effects. More importantly, the effects are a good match for the story and its fantastic speculation about mankind's future. The time machine itself is a good example. It manages to look both quaint and a bit crazy, like a bizarre re-imagining of Santa's sleigh. Rod Taylor stars as 'George' (it was only after several viewings that I realized he was actually H. George Wells!), an inventor who invites some friends over one evening for a demonstration of his latest device. There is a fun moment when he produces a small working model of the time machine, just large enough to sit a cigar in (representing a person), then it disappears into the future. The dialogue in this scene, as in much of the rest of the movie, is fairly insipid but not so awful that we aren't curious as to where the movie will go from here. Shortly afterward, George takes off in the full-scale version for the future himself. Again, the special effects are more figurative and fanciful than the explicitly realistic type we are used to today, and that is part of their charm... such as seeing the clothes store mannequin across the street change fashions every few seconds. After a couple of stops along the way, George ends up 800,000 years in the future. The inhabitants are a child-like race of humans who seem to have no cares or curiosity about anything. They are completely self-centered and take no interest in George's arrival. It turns out they are controlled by Morlocks, a subterranean race of creatures, violent and tyrannical. This futuristic world is imaginatively portrayed as eerily calm and peaceful on the surface, and hellish below. After rescuing the humans from the Morlocks' rule and destroying the underground caverns, George hopes he has inspired the humans to do more with their lives and returns to the past. Yet he feels he has left unfinished business in the future and so goes back there, taking with him three books, which are not revealed. The best parts of 'The Time Machine' are the scenes where George travels into the future, the wondrously weird special effects, and the art direction throughout. As long as you're not expecting a cerebral treatise on the subject of time travel, 'The Time Machine' is a fun ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was only a few weeks ago that I read H.G. Wells' 1895 novel, "The Time Machine," for the first time, and I think it's safe to say that I fell in love with it. Few authors have the ability to communicate so much detail and emotion in so few words, and the quiet train journeys during which I read the Time Traveller's tales swiftly transformed into an another world, to a moment 800,000 years in the future. Even now, I am endowed with the mental image of the passing days, years and centuries; the painful flickering of the sun rising and falling each night, the steady erosion of the surrounding hills and rivers. The small, pathetic Eloi people, with their slow and indifferent grins, steadily approach across the fields. In the underground tunnels, furry white hands, cold and clammy in the darkness, grope savagely at the Time Traveller's body and clothes. Having formulated my own vivid visualisations from the words of H.G. Wells, I wondered if it was even necessary for me to watch a cinematic version of the story, but, fortunately, I found George Pal's film to be an admirably loyal and imaginative adaptation.Whereas Wells' Time Traveller was not afforded the luxury of a name, George Pal's Traveller is christened George (played by Australian-born Rod Taylor ) {in fact, a closer inspection of the machine control panel reveals the phrase "manufactured by H George Wells," further evidence of the respect that the filmmakers had for the author and his source material}. Much of the story, as was the case in Wells' novel, is told in flashback, as the Time Traveller, George, bursts into one of his own upper-class dinner parties, his clothes torn into shredded rags and his face dirty and pale. As he wolfs down meat and alcohol, George begins to recount his extraordinary tale, of the construction of his sled-like machine, and his journey thousands of years into the future. Also pivotal to the story is David Filby (Alan Young), an amiable and intelligent friend who alone believes George's fantastic tale. In 1993, the documentary "Time Machine: The Journey Back" included a mini-sequel of sorts, in which George and David are re-united after years apart, and both Taylor and Young {as well as Whit Bissell} returned to reprise their roles.In a not-unexpected deviation from the original story, given the political climate in 1960, George makes three brief stop-overs prior to his arrival into the land of the Eloi and the Morlocks. With the story beginning on the final day of 1899, the film's writers, blessed with the gift of hindsight, make use of the last sixty years of world history ? most importantly, George experiences the horrors of the two World Wars, and a third scheduled for 1966, and some fun is had with the constantly-changing women's fashions. The Oscar-winning special effects of Gene Warren and Tim Baar look magnificent in vibrant Metrocolor, and stop-motion is used extensively to simulate the rapid passing of time. As far as the year 802,701 is concerned, David Duncan's screenplay remains commendably true to its source material: though the Eloi have admittedly been given slightly greater communication skills, in order to propel the plot more easily, their complete indifference to knowledge is well-constructed, and we share George's frustration and anger when he exclaims: "What have you done? Thousands of years of building and rebuilding, creating and recreating so you can let it crumble to dust. A million years of sensitive men dying for their dreams... for what? So you can swim and dance and play."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is truly a gem. There are problems with it when compared to H.G. Wells's original story, but many of the additions and changes actually are improvements, in my opinion. If there is one thing I WOULDN'T have changed, it was the part where the Time Traveler finally figures it all out: the Eloi are merely fatted cattle and the Morlocks are their "cowboys." In the book it comes through that the Eloi are not particularly good and the Morlocks aren't really evil- both groups are merely evolutionary products. Of course, theater audiences in 1960 wouldn't have accepted this.Back to the film: the story is touching and I liked the sets and model-work. I have the DVD and I have watched it multiple times.

		<shortDescription>It's About Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has always been a favorite of mine. Part of it is that I 14 by candlelight because they hadn't hooked up the electricity in the house we had moved into. I was enthralled by the story. I knew that the state of the movies in those days would not allow a production of "The Time Machine" to match the book. When I finally got to see it, I was amazed. It wasn't half bad. It took elements of the book and expanded on them. It gave a human quality. I don't see the characters as cut out. I see them as the rigid scientists of the time with their Royal Academy scepticism. I thought also that the Time Traveller was so taken with his invention that he failed to realize what a dinosaur he would be as he entered the future. Filby is a character that takes us back to the theme that life must be a process and to attempt to jump that process leads to chaos (Jurassic Park). It is better left to its own unwinding. He is the naysayer but he is kind and fearful for his friend. Still, I have always been one to look at things with a pretty open mind and seeing the mannequin change in the window, the wars coming an going, the death of culture--which, by the way, is probably going to happen as the earth finds its level gave me a lot of joy. People complain about contemporary special effects. What they fail to realize is that some movies, like Hollow Man, are nothing but special effects--no fun--no story. The Morlocks were very creatively done although as primitive as they were, I couldn't see how they could get together to develop the methods for harvesting their pray. The Eloi were also a little too civilized. They were modest and well clothed. Who made their clothes? I will always be a sucker for movies like "From the Earth to the Moon," "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," and "The Time Machine" because I want so badly to see what creative minds can do with tales written before most of science hadn't been explained. I hope the 2001 version takes all the technological gifts we have and does a great job of reproducing the original and doesn't have Kevin Bacon as a contemporary scientist, doing his thing. The track record is pretty lousy on remakes. I want this one to dazzle us, not exploit us!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only sci-fi movie I have ever liked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never into sci-fi. But I must admit the book was a little better than this movie. But this movie rocked anyway! It had awesome special effects, the best I have ever seen! The hero is George a misunderstood young scientist who wanted to travel into the fourth dimension by time traveling in hoping to find some paradise. His friends didn't believe him, but only David Filby had faith in him. Once he tries out his time machine, he's in for a big adventure! First he goes through WW1 and then WW2. And he even witnesses a nuclear war in 1966! Then he goes to the year 802,701 A.D. and finds a different world. He soon finds out that humanity was at war and has divided into two groups, The child-like and apathetic Eloi and The Morlocks who lived underground. He finds love with an Eloi woman named Weena. Their relationship blossomed into romance. But then he hears that the Eloi were enslaved by the Morlocks and they had all the techology and power. The Morlocks provided the Eloi with that weird looking fruit, clothes, and shelter but only so the Morlocks could eat the Eloi. The Morlocks were cannibals. The best part was where George was beating up on the Morlocks almost killing them all and saving the Eloi from their usual fate. The movie wasn't anything like the book, but then again any movie that based on a book really isn't. Instead of killing off Weena by dying in a fire, she simply pined away for George once he went back to his time.  If you've never seen this flick before, rent it at your local video store, or read the book! But whatever you do, don't see that lame 1978 remake! See this version instead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently read the book "The Time Machine" by H.G. Wells. It kept me from sleeping for a while because I thought the Morlocks were chasing me! This film I have loved since childhood but now I see that it differs from the book quite a lot. Nevertheless, the spirit of the novel is in this film and it is so much better than the Guy Pearce film of 2002.That film was bizarre, especially in the way it showed the Eloi living in cages on cliffs above the sea. Then there was the incomprehensible part played by Jeremy Irons.This film starred Rod Taylor and he was ideal for the part.The book was written in 1895. The film has him starting off on the last day of 1899. He sees 1917, 1940 and 1966 before going to 802,701. The world of the Eloi and the Morlocks is evoked extremely well and there is great imagination in the sets. Rod Taylor is exactly the way I imagined the Time Traveller to be when I was reading the novel.Yvette Mimieux also plays Weena in just the right way. The book ends with the narrator saying that he is glad that "mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man." Rod Taylor died at the beginning of this year and "The Birds" and this are the two films for which he will always be remembered. Some things have been changed, but I feel sure that if he had lived to see it H.G. Wells himself would have approved of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>different time periods, same story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>H. G. Wells's classic novel popularized the concept of time travel. I've never read the novel, but George Pal's 1960 adaptation of "The Time Machine" is a really cool movie. There were a few things that I interpreted from it.The time-traveling scientist (Rod Taylor, RIP) goes to multiple points in the future and finds repeated wars. I suspect that the screenwriter added these to the plot for historical accuracy. The time traveler notes that in his own time he sees governments creating more and more ways to kill each other. No doubt Wells's socialist views led him to grow disgusted with this. Indeed, the Eloi and Morlocks are supposed to be the descendants of the rich and poor, respectively.The depiction of a future in which all the world knowledge has died out reminds me of Mike Judge's "Idiocracy", in which a man gets cryogenically frozen and wakes up 500 years later, finding the world populated entirely by stupid people (to the degree that there's a TV show about a man suffering repeated crotch injuries, and a movie that's a two-hour shot of someone's butt).As for the rest of the cast. Alan Young (Filby) is best known as Wilbur on "Mister Ed"* and Scrooge on "DuckTales". Yvette Mimieux (Weena) later starred as the Princess in a segment of Pal's "Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm". Paul Frees (the talking rings) provided the voice of Boris on "Rocky and Bullwinkle" and also the Ghost Host in Disneyland's Haunted Mansion.Basically, it's one of the neatest movies that you'll ever see. Ditto Pal's movies "The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm" and "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao". There was a 2002 adaptation of the book, but I think that I'll skip that movie.*I only watched that show to see Wilbur's wife Carol. You don't know what a hottie is until you've seen her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's A Great Irony Here When You Think About It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not unfair to say that H.G. Wells, who wrote the short novel on which this movie is based, was ahead of his time. Writing in 1895, the concept of time travel would probably have been unusual to say the least to readers of the era. Fast forward 65 years to director George Pal's movie version of the story. In its own way, this is also ahead of its time. Although science fiction was well established by 1960, I can't recall too much having been done with the concept of time travel at this point. So, in a sense, Pal was also a bit of a pioneer, putting together a very convincing movie version of the novel, with pretty good (for the time) special effects (which won an Oscar) and enough suspense to keep the viewer interested.The movie opens on January 5, 1900 - just a few days after the turn of the century. Inventor George Wells has invited several of his friends to dinner, but he's mysteriously late, and when he does finally show up his dishevelled appearance shocks his friends. Wells then recounts his wild tale of time travel - beginning with a dinner party a few days before, on December 31, 1899, with these same friends, to whom he revealed the invention of his time machine, and who mocked him in return. After they leave, Wells decides to test the machine, eventually travelling many thousands of years into the future, where he discovers that humanity seems to have been divided into two groups - the mysteriously young Eloi, who live on the earth's surface and seem to have an idyllic existence, enjoying plenty of food and apparently doing little if any work, and the monstrous Morlocks, who retreated underground. What George finally discovers about the relationship between the two groups shocks him.It's all well done - including the performance of Rod Taylor as inventor George. What really struck me was the irony involved in the story. George is in despair over the fate of humanity. In his own time, England is involved in the Boer War. Traveling ahead a few years in time, he discovers England enmeshed in World War I; traveling ahead a few more years he finds England in the midst of World War II. Is there to be no relief from war? Setting his sights on the far distant future, George finally discovers what seems to be a world at peace - but his contribution is to lead the Eloi in a violent revolt against the Morlocks. A justifiable revolt in the circumstances, but still ... not what you would have expected from him. And, in the end, after he returns to his own time and fails to convince his friends of what he's accomplished, George heads back to the future - bringing with him three (unnamed) books. Obviously he felt the need to share some of his own time's knowledge and learning with the Eloi - which, given his disdain for his own time, is another piece of irony.It's quite well done - including, if I may say, the inclusion of the very lovely Yvette Mimieux as George's Eloi friend (love interest?) Weena, as well as supporting (if limited) performances from Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot, Tom Helmore and Whit Bissell as George's friends and dinner guests. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Science-Fiction Movie For Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"H. George Wells" is an inventor living in London during the turn of the 20th Century who has invited four good friends over for dinner because he has some exciting news to tell them. When they finally get there he appears in a disheveled condition and relates to them that he has invented a time machine and has gone into the future and just now returned. After a quick glass of wine to help him recover his senses he then goes on to tell them several amazing stories of future events. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this film produced in 1960 and based on a novel written by H.G. Wells in 1895. As a result some of the stories are obviously quite dated and the special effects aren't nearly as good as anything produced today. Even so this was definitely a good science-fiction movie for its time and still manages to be quite entertaining. Along with that, it features the lovely Yvette Mimieux (as "Weena") who certainly adds to the scenery. Above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>H. George Wells (Rod Taylor) is a scientist living in London at the beginning of the 20th century. He puts forth the following idea to his skeptical friends: what if you could travel in the fourth dimension, the dimension of time? George, a well meaning, inquisitive type, proceeds to do just that, using his time travelling machine to arrive at various points in history. Eventually, he ends up thousands of years into the future, where he encounters simple minded, uneducated young people who call themselves Eloi. They're being bred for a sinister purpose by the Morlocks, glowing eyed hirsute beasts who dwell underground. George, the kind of person who wants to do good in the world, tries to motivate the seemingly helpless Eloi to fight back against their aggressors."The Time Machine" is a colourful, gorgeously shot sci-fi adventure that gets a lot of mileage out of the charismatic central performance by Taylor. The beautiful Mimieux is utterly enchanting as his love interest and one can easily understand why George would be so smitten. The special effects are extremely well done, and famed producer George Pal, doubling here as director, gives the film an adequate but unhurried pace. The strong supporting cast also includes Alan Young (who plays both David and James Filby), Sebastian Cabot, Tom Helmore, and Whit Bissell as Georges' doubting associates. Doris Lloyd plays housekeeper Mrs. Watchett, and that's an uncredited Paul Frees supplying the voices of the talking rings. Russell Garcias' music score is rousing and the design of the Time Machine itself and the creepy Morlock antagonists is impressive. The nuclear destruction of London, complete with volcanic eruption, is memorable.As he arrives at each point in time, George sees some of the worst examples of humanity, and some of its darkest periods, so his mindset by the conclusion is plausible. This is an inherently likable character with sufficient rooting interest.Good, appealing entertainment overall, for viewers of many ages.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit boring but nice special effects for the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's early in 1900. A haggard H.G.'George' Wells (Rod Taylor) arrives late to his own dinner party. He tells his four disbelieving friends about his time machine. He brings out his miniature time machine to demonstrate. After they leave, George starts up his full scale model and travels into the future. He stop at 1917 and finds the world at war. Next he stops at 1966 where he faces a nuclear blast that unleashes a torrent of volcanic lava. He starts up his machine just before the lava covers him up. He's stuck in harden rock until he travels to 802,701 when the rock finally wears away. He finds a civilization with the subterranean Morlocks and the weak-minded peaceful surface dwelling Elois. He meets the beautiful Eloi Weena (Yvette Mimieux).The small scale model is unimpressive and it's a slow start. It did win the Oscar for special effects mostly for the time traveling effects. That's really the most fascinating part of the movie. The rest is a bit boring. Rod Taylor is fairly stiff. The acting is generally weak and the dialog isn't that much better. There isn't much tension in the way the story is told. It is an old fashion sci-fi but it is fascinating to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an aged special effect movie, but still better than the 2002 remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film adaptation of H.G. Wells science fiction novel THE TIME MACHINE, made more than half a century ago by Hungarian-born American animator and sci-fi genre artisan George Pal. It won an Oscar for BEST EFFECTS predominantly courtesy of its groundbreaking time-lapse technique to reflect the accelerating alteration of the space when the time machine is operating. But a common setback of well-acclaimed oldie sci-fi pictures is that there is no doubt they were state-of-the-art in their times, nevertheless gaging by today's appraisal, its impact will inevitably take a back seat, more or less. It is rather problematic for new viewers to sense the same thrill as if we had never been inculcated by the evolution of film history. Once our eyes are opened, there is no turning back to the rudimentary achievement. While the time-line is striding into 20th century, Rod Taylor is H. George Wells himself, a Victorian inventor tries to convince his four friends he has created a time machine and has traveled to the far far future of 802,701 A.C. and back, naturally their skepticism is a knee-jerking feedback but none of the four care to at least mention that they would like to see the machine itself, nor does George have the initiative to show them, although they have already witness a scaled-down miniature version, three of them never take him seriously. Only David Filby (Alan Young), the kindest of them, proves to be George's true friend, during the time travel, George meets his son James (played by Young as well) twice in different years. The first time is after WWI, he knows David is dead in the war but it is him who has kept George's old house untouched and believed he would return; the second time is in the near future 1966 (as the film is made in 1960), the world is in another chaos of a war time, the elderly James wears a bizarre outfit resembling spaceman while looking for a hiding place after the ominous air strike alert. Resoundingly, these parts become the most touching vignettes throughout the entire movie. "He has got all the time in the world", David comments, but he doesn't know how much time is left for him. The actual happenings in 802,701 A.C. doesn't take up too much time at one might expect, at that epoch, the human races are divided into two species, Elois and Molocks, the former is comprised of young people only, with human appearance (but outdated hairdo), live in an ostensibly Utopian realm, soon George finds them all been brainwashed, deficit in human emotion and oblivious of history and any other common knowledges, a numbed generation so to speak, with an empty head; the latter, has degenerated into a more scary and primitive form, lives underground, they don't even speak human language, still, they are (inexplicably) capable of domineering Elois and running machines, and ghastly feed themselves on cannibalism (which the movie has no guts to capitalize on). There will be a contingent good-vs-evil fight to liberate Elois, but it is ridiculously and amateurishly executed, poor Molocks, they only possess a terrifying physique, in the hand-to- hand combat, they are as bruise-easy as a meek kitten. Up to this point, viewers can just relax and laugh about the burlesque with self-aware seriousness.By all means, this film is much better than the soon forgotten remake THE TIME MACHINE (2002, 4/10), and the liberation movement hasn't quite finished yet, everything indicates a sequel which failed to shape up before Pal's death in 1980. All spectacles aside (which marvelously anticipates STAR WARS trilogy), the film is imbued with a pessimistic prospect about mankind's future, and only if the lesson could have been learned in a more poignant way, it would be a more telling and timeless Sci-Fi masterpiece which could be pertinent to us at any time span, as the mystically astounding PLANET OF THE APES (1968, 8/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Pal's classic sci-fi fantasy film based on H.G. Wells' famous novel. Rod Taylor stars in arguably his best role as the Victorian inventor H. George Wells who builds a time machine and travels to the future, where he finds humanity divided into two groups: the Eloi and the Morlocks. Yvette Mimieux plays Weena, the pretty Eloi girl our hero falls in love with. Alan Young (of Mister Ed and Scrooge McDuck fame) gives a warm, amiable performance as George's friend. Sebastian Cabot and Whit Bissell have small roles but are enjoyable as always. Fantastic, colorful, imaginative movie with nice visuals and a kick-ass time machine. It may not be practical-looking, but like Robby the Robot from Forbidden Planet, it is completely charming and fun. These great old sci-fi movies embraced the imagination of science fiction far more than the practicality. I personally love that and feel that's what has made these classics endearing to this day. I wish we had more of that in the sci-fi films of today, which all too often seem constrained by fears of being nitpicked to death by the Super Serious Brigade. Also watch out for the literati branch of film snobs. You know the type -- any movie based on a book they love can never live up to the book and must be denigrated at all costs. Don't let them sway you. Whether you've read the book or not, see this film and judge it on its own merits. It's a pleasant, good-time movie without pretensions. Definitely check it out.</fullReview>

I'm saying the same thing I said about the remake of "Flight of the Phoenix" Sometimes well enough is better left alone...Rod Taylor was a popular actor in the 60's.His performance in this Film and "The Birds" in 1963 made him one of my favorite actors in the day.The Original TIME MACHINE will be a film seen by future Generations as maybe the way todays generation looks at TV's 60's Star Trek.Dated Technology but still Great Cinema...s.m.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twilight Zone with a Big Budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intelligent and lavish reworking of the classic Wells novel. British gentleman George Wells (Taylor) devises a time-travel machine that can take him backward or forward in time. While entertaining friends, he decides to go forward thousands of years to the very spot he left from. At that future point, however, Earth is peopled by passive blonde youngsters, the Eloi, who appear completely devoid of emotion or concept. What has happened over the millenia to render them so passively apathetic. They look human, but are they. And who are the Morloc, the only word these zombie-like people utter, and what does that ominous stone sphinx indicate.It's a lavish George Pal production, using state-of-the-art special effects that hold up quite nicely. Credit too the art and set directors for the impressive sets that must have cost a bundle. Of course, it would be easy reading into the story allegorical meanings, since the elements lend themselves to symbolism of many types. After all, George ends up bringing out the human characteristics so long buried inside the Eloi. While, their Morloc masters have mutated into metallic-like subterranean monsters. The fact that the Eloi are all blonde and lissome is also allegorically suggestive, however it might be interpreted.Taylor is appropriately assertive and virile in his lead role, while Mimieux hasn't much to do except stand around and look pretty, like the rest of the Eloi. All in all, the movie is eye- catching adult sci-fi with no corners cut. Think the Twilight Zone but with no budgetary limits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching THE TIME MACHINE. The 1960 movie.Firstly, what a good looking guy Rod Taylor was, and I'm a heterosexual man. Like some male actors, you knew that when he did a fight scene that he could really fight, (Elvis was another). No cream-puff right or left punching with a sound effect.This is a well made film, well directed with good production values. Albert Einstein proved that time travel into the future is theoretically possible; That is; A man leaves Earth and zooms around the galaxy at near light speed for 5 years and returns to Earth. The traveler will have aged 5 years, however the Earth he returns to has aged more than 5 years...Don't ask me to do the calculations.The paradox of going back in time keeps me awake at night.Why haven't we been visited by people from the future? Maybe we have, and they have solved the paradox.I believe the answers lie in the science of sub atomic research. Quantum mechanics and physics. In the quantum world, the laws of physics do not apply. The further we enter the sub atomic world, the more strange and wondrous it becomes.We're into the world of parallel or even an infinite Universe If you're hankering to find Jesus, you may turn your attention to science, as opposed to the blathering's of ancient Semitic tribes.But hey, that's just me.

		<fullReview>An essential fantasy film for anyone's collection, starring Rod Taylor as the intrepid inventor H.G Wells who following a series of mishaps experimenting with his time machine, eventually discovers a future earth that is bereft of wars, famine or the spectres of civilisation, but occupied by a placid population seemingly unable to sustain itself amid a pervasive naivety to danger. Yvette Mimieux plays a young inhabitant of the new world to whom Taylor takes a liking, while defending her tribe against subterranean villains called Morlocks.Great to see how the eras come and pass, Taylor giving us a ringside view of the 19th and 20th century as he zips through time, observing fashions, tragedies and the persistence of mankind to evolve. Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot, Tom Helmore and Whit Bissell play his friends in the present day, naturally sceptical of his invention only Young apparently open to the possibilities of his unbridled imagination.Great family fare with very little to scare the youngsters, a timeless classic that doesn't need to be remade to reach a modern-day audience (dispense with Guy Pearce's attempt, this one will do).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really good movie. The FX are good especially the makeup for the Morlocks and the lapse photography. I really enjoyed the time travelling sequences,they where really effective and this movie has all-round good effects. The cast is good with Rod Taylor and Alan Young etc. Rod Taylor plays a scientist who goes to the future and finds the Eloi and their paradise but he then finds out that they've stopped growing their intellect and as a man of science, this makes him livid. So he decides to return to his era, he then finds out that the Morlocks have stolen his time machine. This leads him to find out that the Morlocks are breeding the Eloi and are the cannibalistic descendant from Homo Sapien. It's basically a film of discovery and adventure with good suspense. It has good action scenes involving whips and set underground (reminds me of Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom). And the monster design for the Morlock is perfect. The Morlock are definitely one of my favourite movie monsters and the salt vampires in the star trek episode "Where no man has gone before" look a lot like the Morlock. All sci-fi fans will love it. I must add though, the novel is better- the novel deals with the upper classes taking advantage of the lower classes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 1960, science fiction was the embarrassing orphan child of cinema. There had been sci-fi movies since the start, of course, but, as a genre, science fiction was never really embraced by the mainstream until a) the artistic recognition afforded to 2001: A A Space Odyssey and b) the commercial success of Star Wars (A New Hope).George Pal, essentially an independent filmmaker specialising in small-scale fantasy movies, always took a great deal of trouble within his limited resources to make the best quality movies he could. And so his version of The Time Machine, while showing the relative lack of sophistication of special effects in 1960s, and of budget restrictions in terms of it being fairly studio-bound, does very well with those resources which were available to it.The Victorian era is well evoked, and Rod Taylor and Alan Young are both well cast. Welles' story is fairly faithfully retold, and the whole thing was a very welcome treat for the sci-fi-starved moviegoer of 1960.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M-G-M presents a George Pal directed Sci-Fi adventure based on the classic novel by H.G. Wells. Matinée idol Rod Taylor stars as George, a young scientist that builds a time machine and thrusts himself into the future. On the last day of 1899, George successfully hurtles into war-torn 1917. Depression has the time traveler rapidly passing through decades to stop in 1966 and London is under an other world nuclear attack. George escapes to travel to 802,701 to find a world populated with a population with no ambition and no concern for the future. He saves the kittenish Yvette Mimieux from drowning and the two enter an awkward relationship. Producer-director Pal's special effects win an Oscar. THE TIME MACHINE has all the elements of a classic in spite of a few inconsistencies. In support: Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot, Whit Bissell and Tom Helmore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Pal &amp; H.G. Wells - An Unbeatable Combination!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel by H.G. Wells, 'The Time Machine' ( 1960 ) is quite simply the best movie of its kind. Victorian inventor H.George Wells ( Rod Taylor ) has built a time machine and travels into the far future where the Human Race has divided itself into two species - the Eloi ( who are beautiful and who live on the surface ) and the Morlocks ( who are grotesquely ugly and live underground ). The latter are also cannibals, and are breeding the Eloi for food purposes. When Weena ( Yvette Mimieux ), an Eloi whom George has become fond of, is taken to their lair, he breaks in and sets about rescuing her, causing a revolution along the way. The film ends with him helping the Eloi rebuild civilisation.Producer George Pal was also responsible for 'War Of The Worlds' ( another Wells adaptation ) and 'When Worlds Collide'. While 'Time' lacks the book's political and social allegory, it is still a thumping good adventure story, with some of the best special effects from that period ( by Wah Chang ). The time machine's travels evoke a sense of wonder missing in many of today's C.G.I. jamborees, boasting superb stop-motion photography ( the changing fashions on a shop window dummy are used to denote the passing of time ). The machine itself is a wonderful creation; basically a chair on a sled with a spinning disc behind it. Even the control panel with the date rolling away furiously looks marvellous. As 'George', Rod Taylor acquits himself well ( his best moment is when he loses his temper on finding the Eloi library consists of nothing more than a few rotting books ) even though he is fundamentally miscast as a Victorian gentleman. Ditto Alan Young as his close friend James Filby. On the other hand, Yvette Mimieux is breathtakingly beautiful, and her scenes with Taylor are touching.The Morlocks themselves are horrific, ape-like creatures with eyes that glow in the dark! When one dies just as George activates the machine, we see it decompose to nothing ( the eye rolls out of the skull ), a sequence that must have frightened many children back in 1960. Russell Garcia's music too fits the film perfectly.Any flaws? Well, George is able to rouse the Eloi from their centuries-long apathy with remarkable ease, and if there was a nuclear war in 1966 I must have missed it! These are trivial concerns though. 'The Time Machine' is an unalloyed classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie. I have not seen the 2002 remake but I doubt it could be any better than this one. Young is excellent in the main role, and it is extraordinary to see how he travels in time. I am not a big fan of H.G.Wells books but they really deal with some interesting subjects such as aliens, the fourth dimension and an invisible man. The subject of time travel is one that fascinates me a lot. It is also dealt with in a spectacular way in the two independent movies The Butterfly Effect and Donnie Darko. Back to the Future is also excellent, of course. In a way, Back to the Future is a remake of this movie although it does not deal with eloids and morlocks. In the same way as Orwell's 1984, I guess, The Time Machine has something to say about our time as well. Perhaps we are not as bad off as the eloids and morlocks but if things go wrong we could easily get there because that world the main character finds 800.000 years into the future is indeed a sad vision of the future of mankind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the special effects of the 2002 remake of The Time Machine are truly quite interesting, I really much prefer the more subtle and much more profound nature of the 1960 version. Yes, the special effects are not as good as the 2002 vehicle, but you have to remember that this film was of course made in 1960, when special effects were a bit more primitive than nowadays. This 1960 version of The Time Machine just happens to be, in my humble opinion, a multi-layered movie of enormous warm, and wealth of philosophical feeling (although some folks might not get that impression after only one viewing). I think that it is definitely right up there philosophically with a profound nature that closely approaches the visionary quality of the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey". Now, it must be said that I for one could absolutely watch this 1960 version of The Time Machine every day for 100 years, and never get tired of it....ever, if only I had the time !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic adaptation of a classic book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall that when I first watched this film as a child it was both exciting and in some parts rather frightening, watching it again as an adult it wasn't as frightening but was still exciting if a little dated in parts.The story opens with a group of Victorian gentlemen awaiting their host for dinner in the opening days of 1900. When their host arrives he id dirty, dishevelled and clearly has been through an ordeal; the story of the past few days is then told in flashback. We return to when the group last got together and George, the host, demonstrated to them a small device that he claimed was a time machine, they however thought it was a mere parlour trick when the device vanished. When they leave he goes to his laboratory and climbs in to the full sized version of the machine. At first he just travels a few minutes into the future but then advances several years at a time, unfortunately he keeps stopping during times of war. Encased in rock after a nuclear war he is forced to continue travelling into the distant future until he is once again in the open air.When he stops he explores his surroundings and finds that there are people nearby, they initially seem like normal people living an idyllic lifestyle but when one falls into a river and nearly drowns none of them left as finger to help. He rescues her and from her learns that these people are the Eloi and she is called Weena. He also learns that there is no technology in their society and they are taken into caves by another race of humans known as the Morlocks. He is stranded when these Morlocks take his time machine into their caves so must confront them in an effort to get it back and return home for the dinner we saw in the opening scene.This is a film that any fan of classic science fiction really has to see. It doesn't follow the book totally but still gives a good story. The films makers have included the two world wars which Wells obviously didn't know about when he wrote the story in 1895 and the Eloi still speak English unlike the unknown language they used in the original story. Some elements of the story seem dated now, for example we know that there wasn't a nuclear war in 1966. The special effects which were good for their time now look like they wouldn't find a place in a low budget television production, that said if you can overlook these faults it is a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When In The World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Time Machine' is, for the most part, a beautifully-crafted work of science fantasy that pays close attention to HG Wells's original.Richard Todd is well-cast as the time-keeper-with-a-difference. Though his accent is a little out of place. We see him demonstrate the miniature before his assembled dinner-guests, and share in their perplexity as it vanishes like the conjuring trick most suppose it to be. The true appeal of this movie is in the carefully observed detail of time's passage. The movement of the sun and moon, the changing of the seasons, and also that of fashion, rather improbably represented by the mannequin in a store window opposite our hero's laboratory. That last detail is a little crass, and does not come from Mr Wells's pen.There are some nice little sentimental touches, too: a best friend who put the time traveller's property in trust, staunchly believing in his eventual return, or a meeting with that friend's son, many years after his death. It reminds us of, but doesn't dwell upon, the ephemeral nature of human affairs. This is a very personal drama as well as a cracking science fantasy.The concept of a nuclear war precipitating a volcanic eruption under the streets of some un-named British city is definitely a bit daft. And it looks more like a jam disaster in Lego-land. Then we are in the far future. The trees and shrubs in this remote epoch still look suspiciously like those of today but with a scattering of exotic plastic fruits taped to them. They look extremely hokey and I guess the budget didn't go far enough to do something more elaborate. The Eloi are considerate enough to speak English with American accents even after the huge passage of time. And they're pretty too - which means they're good and worth saving, despite being daft as brushes. The Morlocks, on the other hand, are a bad crowd. They live underground and eat meat (something the time-traveller has no objection to doing for himself) and despite being clever, organised and practical - they're ugly. Which means they're for the chop. To be fair to the movie; this is Wells's own cockeyed morality, not the director's. He descends into their world and is nearly captured, but eventually escapes a cunning trap after a close fist-fight. He kills a Morlock with a single blow and we watch its body decompose in a neat accelerated sequence. Considering this is a sealed space it is not clear from where the illumination is coming. To this extent the movie is a pretty authentic take on Well's idea. I saw it some years before I read the book and found the latter just as gripping and fascinating, but also rather depressing. In the story, the traveller runs on into the future, and sees the world and its life gradually running down. At last, the desolate Earth has apparently ceased to turn on its axis and a geriatric sun stands huge and red over the horizon.Sound effects are basic but adequate, however there is a nice romantic music score. I haven't yet seen the recent remake and - call me a pessimist - I am in no hurry. This work is dated now, some of the (Oscar-winning) effects though splendid in their day now seem a little amateurish, but as a mingling of human drama with fascinating theory it is still a very entertaining and recommended watch. One final nitpick: in the future, the Morlocks drag the time machine several metres across the ground. Later, on return, we see drag marks along the conservatory floor and garden of the time-traveller. Clearly, dragging it thousands of years in the future couldn't possibly leave tracks in the past. Wells himself would never have made such a gaff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little fantastic, but lots of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Pal's "The Time Machine" was one of many of his fantasy films of the era, but this one is definitely one of the most popular of those, and it's not hard to see why. Based upon H.G. Wells' fantastic 1895 novel, it tells the tale of a Victorian era man who, fascinated with time, has managed to invent a 'contraption' which will enable him to freely travel within the fifth dimension. With the dream of a peaceful and worry free future, he whisks away to a new and undiscovered world.H.G. Wells proves himself a fine story teller, and Pal's f/x genius adds real excitement to this fabulous yarn. And although the screenplay has been updated for 1960 (with the knowledge of the World Wars and the atomic bomb), it still remains very true to the original tome.The cast really don't have to do much to make this picture, as the afore mentioned attributes already do, yet Rod Taylor's inventor George is well played by the leading man, whilst the supporting cast are suitable.Occasionally perhaps a little too fantastic, but who cares, it's still a heck of a lot of fun to watch this time travel movie which probably really started the whole genre off, as "Somewhere in Time", "The Terminator" and "Back to the Future" followed suit quite successfully!Wednesday, December 22, 1993 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out a bit slow, and you worry that it is going nowhere. This actually helps to build the anticipation of George's arrival to the future. George is a scientific thinker who creates a time machine. None of his friends believe him, so he sets off in 1899, headed for the future. He stops during WWI, and again in WWII, wondering what the world has come to. He then continues on his journey until he reaches some very distant time that even we can't imagine. There he finds lush forests, clear waters and happy people. There are no jobs, no work to do, nothing but food and fun. But he notices that there is nobody over the age of twenty.Why you ask, because the underground race of the Morlocks harvest the fun loving people as food. During the wars many years ago, some people chose to stay underground in the bomb shelters for fear of what was above. These people developed into the morlocks who are a very smart, yet hideous race of "people." Those above are carefree and dumb, and do not even understand the morlocks power. It is up to George to save the race of Eloy (above ground) from the terrible ways of the morlock. It is also up to George to save the fate of his new love Weena. Will she be eaten by the morlocks, or will she live happily ever after with George.The thought provoking part of the movie is this. Is there a fourth dimension of time. We are all sitting here at this very moment in time, but is there someone in the same exact spot as you 10 years from now, 20 years, 1000 years? Why is war such a dividing factor for the race of human beings? Is knowledge power? This movie is absolutely fantastic and it should be on your list of movies to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Science Fantasy Classic...After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While certainly avoiding most of H.G. Wells themes, nonetheless George Pal produced and directed one of the finest American science fiction films.Rod Taylor is very sympathetic and passionate, a Victorian liberal scientist, as the man who tries to save the future by teaching the apathetic Elio how to become human again. Yvette Mimiuex is pretty, apropos vacant but comes alive at the end.Altho some here claim the effects are dated, they are wrong. The effects are terrific and filled with a personal uniqueness unknown in this age of cookie-cutter CGI. Gene Warren and Wah Chang deliver visual wonders like the fantastic roof window view of history exploding, not to mention the amazing stone head outside the Morlock's lair and the great gory shot where the Morlock disintegrates into time.Film is filled with lovely human moments, such as Alan Young (a superior performance) questioning George's intentions with time; the Eloi finally standing up against the Morlocks; and Alan Young putting together what really happened to his friend at the climax, ably lifted by the wistful score.Watch it as a kid or with kid eyes. Better still, double feature it with Pal's more wonderful 7 FACES OF DR LAO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of nowhere, into the Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1960's, when movie making was still an art form, master puppeteer, George Pal created what has been considered a true classic, The Time Machine. Selecting as his hero, the handsome, gritty and debonair Austrialian actor Rod Taylor, playing Herbert George Wells, the director accurately portrays the adventurous, but moody, Victorian as a gentleman, who dabbles with inventions and yearns for a more peaceful century to live in. Using what has been hailed as the best special effects of that date, Pal launches Taylor into the future. Stopping only to observe the changing eras where war is fought with better and more sophisticated weapons, Wells finally arrives in the land of the Eloi. Here he meets beautiful and sultry Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and her people. During their brief time together, Weena allows Wells to learn that despite their idyllic Paradise, it is not without dangers. In this future, it the Morlock who have become the masters of the world and have stolen Wells' time machine. Doomed to spend eternity in the future, Taylor engages in battle with the Morlocks resulting in a story he will later relate to David Filby (Alan Young) and his Victorian friends. The film is superb and despite being remade several times, has never been equaled. H.G. Wells would have been proud of this version. *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Pal directed this classic from 1960, starring Rod Taylor as the scientist who travels back through time (George, although we are meant to understand that this is a character-cipher for H.G. Wells), and Yvette Mimieux in a very early role (interestingly, she became an anthropologist, the study of which has a concern in the overall plot development and socio-political points Wells was trying to drive home with his novel).The plot follows Wells' late Victorian novel fairly well. Scientist George invents a time machine, and after making the proclamation to several of his nay-saying friends, including a test with a miniature time machine, takes off on a few journeys. The early journeys are just to test, and we see a few fascinating effects here. But the greater story lies in George's hope for the future, so he sets himself to go nearly a million years in to the future - the year 802701.Trivia buffs will recognise the date on the machine as October 12, the same date Columbus discovered the new world. George embarks into this new world, finding the human race has evolved into a split species - the above-ground Eloi, and the below-ground Morlochs. The Eloi are carefree airheads for the most part - that is, until the Morlochs threaten, and then they become the hunted. The Morlochs are presented as base creatures, following only their appetites, and afraid to remain above for too long.The effects of the time machine itself and the transition scenes are quite good for the time - I recall as a child watching this film on television and being mesmerised by the passage of time, the scenery changes through George's window as the time streamed by, and the contrast between the Victorian household set and the future world.The more recent remake did homage to this classic film by incorporating a few of the same ideas - the scene changes through the windows, for example. Also, Alan Young (who played Filby in the 1960 film) appeared in the more recent film, the only actor to appear in both.George has a tough decision to make - his time machine is stolen by the Morlochs; does he risk his life to get it back? And does he opt to stay in the future or go back to his own time if he recovers it? Only time will tell.</fullReview>

Most of the time I don't even want to get to the action scenes. I'm totally enamored with the charming images of Victorian Britain that open the film. When I do make it to the action, I have two preoccupations: Yvette Mimeux, of course, not being a pansy Eloi myself, and ruminations on the thrilling conceptual notion that time changes everything much more than anything else. Just think, all those fantastic, truly mind-boggling events take place just a few hundred yards from the time-traveler's laboratory. The novel and movie are H.G. Wells's reflections on the implications of evolution. As a matter of fact, in the novel, Wells rounds out his musings by setting a final scene way, way into the future, when "man" has "evolved" into something so loathsome that the Morlocks look like Olympians in comparison. Oh, for the glory days of sci-fi movies! The special effects and voice-overs serve something so beautiful in this film, so rare nowadays: an idea!</fullReview>

The print we watched was impeccable - and it wasn't even DvD. I can't wait to see the wide screen digital version. Those Victorian machines... This is a definite keeper. Wells manages to put quite a lot of his own spirit into this story, and it transfers well to celluloid. Ok, why import two Americans to do a British story? But Taylor is good, even if Cabot seems superfluous to me - no offense Sebastian, but I wouldn't have insisted on you in this one. As far as Mimieux goes there can be no such reservations: she's 'dee-lish' (was only 18 at the time) and fills her role perfectly. A very moving story. Rumour has it that there is a DvD version with 2 DvDs in the case, the second devoted to the original screenplay and other things. I haven't found it yet, but I would recommend any aficionados to try to locate it. The screenplay itself would be worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All to often films are referred to as Classic's when they are actually just good movies. George Pal's 1960 "The Time Machine" starring Rod Taylor, fits the definition of a True Classic. The movie still plays well over 40 years after it was first made. Good acting, and interesting script and of course a story from the pen of Jules Vern make for real enjoyment and good viewing. Highly recommend for the entire family. I rated this an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the three books George carried with him on his final journey into the future, this 1960 masterpiece would be one of the top three movies that I would take with me if time travel were a possibility.It is a fantastic cinematic treasure that has fascinated me since I was a child with its fast-moving meditation on the futility of war as a means of preserving capitalism as the paramount means of survival for modern society.The special effects, especially the wizardry engaged in the time warp sequences, are the best I've ever seen in a 42-year-old movie. The way Pal stages that eruption scene almost makes you want to cover your own head in the same manner that moviegoers of H.G.Wells day would have shielded themselves from the tidal waves of nickeloedeon thrills when that lava threatens to roast George alive.I recently purchased this gem in 16mm on e-bay and am DYING to project it on the big screen(the garage door)!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Time Travel Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really good time travel story. I found the ideas very interesting, especially traveling in time over 800,000 years into the future. When George was 'inside' the rock for all those years waiting for a time when the rocks will clear, I kept on thinking about how creepy it was since he wouldn't be able to materialize into the rock. Rod Taylor was excellent in the movie and definitely carried the movie especially in the scenes in the second half of the movie that take place in 802,701. The one thing I did not like about the movie were the Morlocks, I was thinking that even for a production that was done 40 years ago, they could have came up with something better than the blue-green muscle men with long white hair. My rating for 'The Time Machine' is 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films on time travel (my favourite theme) ever made. Picture quality, special effects, acting, music, script ? all of this is made into a 90 minute feast for the eyes, brain and ears ! I do not want to pre-judge the remake which has just come out, as I haven't yet seen it but it will have a hard time beating this !! I'm always moaning about not being able to find `Time After Time' on Dvd, but no such problems with this one. The DVD is excellent, has several languages and subtitles and many very interesting boni, notably the interview with Rod Taylor. Unavailable for some strange reason in Europe, it has to be purchased from the States ! What are the Europeans waiting for ? The idea of travelling in time beyond the year 800,000 just about blows out your brain and makes you realise just how insignificant the passage of our life here on earth is compared with the totality of time and space ! The view of the planet in the year 802,000 is obviously subjective but is obviously totally beyond the imagination of someone in the year 2002 to have the faintest idea of earth at that time, if indeed, the earth will continue to exist in its present form and with its present climate. Mind-boggling !!! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply, this is not only one of the greatest SF movies ever made, its also one of my favorites. It captures the essence of the novel in a way far superior to the gaudier make up. The film moves at a great clip, stopping in WW1, 2 and a nuclear one. All along the way, the Time Traveler (look at the brass plate on the machine to discover he's H.G. Wells!) learns a bit more about himself and humanity before ending up in the year 802,701 where the gentle Eloi are preyed upon by the hideous (William Tuttle created) Morlocks. Rod Taylor is totally dynamic as George the Traveler, while Philby played by Alan Young is the kind of dedicated friend I'd want. Yvette Mimeux brings an innocence to Weena that's perfect. If you like this, I reccomend George Pal's When Worlds Collide and War of the Worlds. I had to give this a ten because it's just that good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the Time Machine (1960). First saw it on the big screen when it was released. Also saw the Time Machine (2002). This newer version is not 10 per cent as good as the older version.Rod Taylor and Allan Young (pre MR ED days) are absolutely superb. Warning --very slight spoiler aheadThe plot is is similar on both Time Machine movies, but the 1960 version has much better acting. The special effects on the original were outstanding (I believed it may have won an Academy Award).This version beats the newer version by 800,000 years I wonder what three books Rod Taylor took back? Probably the best of all the time travel movies I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film as a youngster and remembered enjoying it then, I was reunited with it about 10 years later and I loved it even more so. Just everything about the way H.G Wells has dealt with time travel makes this film a great viewing. He has explored time travelling in a way that leaves you with many captivated thoughts after the film has ended. The monsters do however make the film look dated but this doesn't ruin the film at all it just shows its age and insures its classic authentity.I understand that a remake has been made and is on its way to the big screen, I do hope that they haven't ruined this masterpiece and I look forward too seeing it.</fullReview>

The special effects of this 1960 classic are above par for it's time, but modern viewers will easily see where they fall short. But the excellent acting, especially by Rod Taylor (Of "The Birds" fame) makes this movie. You actually care what happens to him. His reactions are real. And this version of the movie relatively faithful to the novel. I hope the new remake can approach the caliber of acting and emotional intensity of this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been several movie iterations of Wells beautiful book, but I am confident that the 1960 edition will stand the test of time. It has a wonderful ambience reinforced by the director's tasteful choice of understated setwork and style. What I love most about this movie is how much is NOT revealed. In the movie, Rod Taylor roams around in a world 802,701 years in the future that he cannot understand. Just as he cannot understand everything in this strange world, we are left with glimpses of objects and events that are never explained but provoke the imagination. For example, who, I wondered, built the outdoor cafeteria in the interval between 802,701 and 1960? Who, I pondered, lived and died in the interval? The mystery of the year 802,701 is conveyed so clearly and convincingly that I felt as if I had actually visited the future myself.The movie's production date in 1960 helps, rather than hinders the movie. One senses that the palpable tension of the Cold War might have been the fuel that fired the director's imagination. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with a few other Sci-Fi movies of Hollywood second Golden Age period (50ies), this films remains a true classic. It does not betray Welles' masterpiece at all, even with its minor defaults (setting the action of the novel, and thus of the film, 800 000 years later in the future was an useless exageration, for the idea of time travelling was already a great novelty in itself). As it is going to be remade very soon, this proves its poetry and its clever references to total war (as a movie made in 1960, 2 years before Cuba's military blocus) and class conflicts (Humans and Morlocks) are its real assets. Rod Taylor is also very convincing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, The 1960 version of "The Time Machine," based on the novel by H.G. Wells, might be a bit dated and a little to primitive to some viewers, but all those minor problems can be overlookedthanks to the effects and the acting in this movie. Rod Taylor is at his helm as George, the rider of the time machine, whogoes light years into the future, only to discover that life as he knows it becomes very dismal and eeriely unusual. Georgemeets the future inhabitants of Earth, which, after a majornuclear war, has changed dramatically. While there, George en- counters a well-meaning-yet dense humanoid girl named Weena, who steals George's heart. Taylor is typically dashing in this movie, and he is quite con- vincing as the scientist who is shocked at how life is so much different in the future than it was in the past. The effectsare pretty remarkable, for its time at least. But, it's still good entertainment. H.G. Wells would be pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best Wells screen adaption, better than "War Of The Worlds"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the legendary hype around War Of The Worlds, it seems that The Time Machine has been overlooked. Both are classics, there is no doubt, but in my humble opinion, put your money on Time Machine. Both are your basic Sci-Fi flicks, a male hero yearning for his one true love with only a non-human race standing between them, but Time Machine brings more to the table.It may be due to the fact that The Time Machine pulls us in, to travel along with George thru time. We move with him through the centuries, seeing the future, and feeling a bit helpless. It's actually quite humbling, due to the fact that the film reminds us that man has almost no control over time itself!It also may be due to the fact that we get more special effects goodies in this one. Sure the ships and a couple of aliens in Wars were impressive for it's time, but The Time Machine is a colorful film filled with blooming flowers, bright wardrobes (of Weena's passive race), and bright blue Morlock baddies! Quite a contrast to the dreary and colorless "War Of The Worlds".Let's not say the War Of The Worlds is horrible, I think it provides a great contrast to The Time Machine, which is seen when the films are viewed together. Both have the Wells-ian style written all over them, and both follow the fifties sci-fi formula. Yet one is bright, and one is dark. One foretells the future problems, one highlights present problems. Both terrific, but give the edge to the irridescent, future-telling Time Machine!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike Hitchcock's "The Birds," "The Time Machine" has withstood the test of time... with a vengeance! Like many of us, I first saw it as a child. Seeing it now, it has lost absolutely none of its magic and charm, suspense, and above all, the constant sense of the unknown, that deep feeling that something mysterious, unpredictable and utterly magical is about to happen. No other "time travel" movie ever done has captured the sense of what time travel might be like as well as "The Time Machine." I credit this to the screenplay, which is mostly excellent (aside from a little too much time spent with 'Weena' and the Eloi). The special effects have held up mindblowingly well, considering this film was made in 1960. Rod Taylor is the perfect choice as the time traveller and his performance is absolutely outstanding.I admit that I'm not much of a fan of movies (especially movies involving special effects) made prior to 1970, but The Time Machine is an outstanding exception. Yet another is "The Fly," yet I feel The Time Machine exceeds "The Fly" in just about every area - cinematography, special effects, acting, directing, everything. A great entertainment for those who love the sense of the unknown and the unpredictable. 8/10 (I should have given it 9).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film. Rod Taylor plays HG WELLS in this adaptation of the classic novel, THE TIME MACHINE. Rod Taylor uses the machine to propel himself past three world wars and into the distant future were mankind has become lazy and has become wards of a race called THE MOORLOKS. The Moorloks breed the Eloi (lazy humans) like cattle and then take them below ground for a between meal snack. There is a political context to all of this so please read my other post for that....I will not go into that here. Anyway, Wells falls in love with WEENA (YVETTE MIMIEUX) and becomes involved with the ELOI. The ELOI are nothing more than futuristic yuppies who have everything catered for them by the film's villains. Wells gets wind of this foul development and fisticuffs ensue. By the end of the film he's liberated the ELOI, got the girl, taken his time machine back from the cannibals who "jacked" it, and goes back to 1899, to have dinner with his friends....none of who believe him or his fantastic story. Then actor ALAN YOUNG, gets the best line in the movie...it is also the last line...."He's got all the time in the world". When you see the film you will know what he means. I love Alan Young's character of Philby. Philby is Well's compassionate and loyal friend, who in the end is the only one who believes him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is quite enjoyable film. By today's standard, the special effects are nothing, but you don't watch the movie for its special effects (unfortuently Hollywood doesn't seem to acknowledge this), but for its story and acting. This film works on both these levels.Altough the film is not exact to the novel, it is still enjoyable to watch as we follow the hero travelling through time trying to find paradise - he doesn't stop going forward until he finds what man desires the most - a world in peace.He bypasses World War 1, then World War 2, then in 1966 he witnesses a nuclear war(!) - then when he awakenes he finds the world he's longing to find - except he soon discovers that there are two tribes - one whom live underground and have all the technology and the other whom live above ground who are the 'cattle' for the underground tribe.The main hero plays the role superbly, and the vision of the future of man is a frightening one, a world where man has forgotten the power of will and determination.I found it pretty distressing because the tribe whom live above ground are all blonde haired and blue eyed.Overall I enjoyed this film. Perfect for a boring sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fine version of (arguably) H.G.'s best book. Rod Taylor is perfect in the role of The Time Traveller - a very correct, square-jawed Victorian adventurer, but with a dash of the rebel.His initial, tentative experimentation with the machine (a splendid creation) is probably the best sequence in the film. His brief exploration of 1918 and the meeting with his friend's son is particularly poignant.However his emergence into the 1960's during an 'atomic air-raid' - a scene entirely absent from the book - doesn't quite work: the dialogue here is stilted, the silver suits seem a cliche, and footage of real volcanic eruptions sits uneasily with the fantasy feel of the film.But it is a temporary lapse: The eerie world of 802,701 AD with its huge, abandoned buildings, strange succulent fruits, and dense mysterious woodlands with their weird sounds is well realised. The Eloi are suitably apathetic, the Morlocks suitably monstrous, and the action enjoyable. The scene in which the Traveller examines a long-forgotten library and a book falls to dust in his hands is memorable.The finale with the Traveller's friend, Filby, as he realises the truth of the story is well done: The Traveller calling 'Goodbye' instead of 'Good night'; the sound of the Machine making its final trip as Filby attempts to batter down the door; and the missing books from the bookcase. Wonderfully evocative stuff.Good script, good acting, great story. Perfect entertainment. And, if you were going to rebuild civilisation, which three books would you take?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film as a 7 year old boy and had read the book. For 1960, this was a rather big-budgeted picture, with pretty impressive effects. Rod Taylor's portrayal of H. "George" Wells was heartfelt and the film really hinged upon him. This man was a true scientist who became so appalled at the Eloi for no longer having the desire to learn, let alone to stand up to the Morlocks. George showed the Eloi that there was another, more positive way of life. And, as a young boy, that gave me hope for the future. Which, in the beginning of the Kennedy era, I had no idea just how turbulent the '60s would be.I found the depiction of 1966 an interesting interpretation. It would've been even more interesting to see the producer's inter- pretation of the late '80s or 90s, prior to showing a future year most of us cannot relate with (802,771).I have a VHS tape of this film and it is shown on occasion on cable. I watch it a lot. Last time I saw Rod Taylor, it was on "Walker, Texas Ranger", about 2-3 years ago. And even though he is much older, he still had that special quality that came across I remember so well from his portrayal of H. George Wells.</fullReview>

We would expect centuries later to be filled with incredible technology, like in "Back to the Future". But it was all like back to the past, where people become lifeless cattle incapable of constructive mind activity. I am amazed by the imagination the script writers had.I don't think I'd be able to find a video of it, but I do so want to watch the beginning of the show.Rod Taylor -- this is the first time I've seen this actor, and I think he really resembles Harrison Ford, in every way, even their acting skills are of the best quality.This sci-fi film will amaze you, with good acting, good script and beautiful people..... now where did they get all those blondes??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well-remembered film from my youth which doesn't quite stand up to latter-day scrutiny, but is still good in parts. The good parts certainly include affable Rod Taylor in the lead role as the coincidentally named inventor H G Wells, keeping his level of conviction going right to the end. The underlying anti-war message will always be topical while there's a further sub-text on humanity's inbuilt resistance to tyranny as seen by the eventual awakening of the soporific Eloi against their underground oppressors, the Morlocks.Best by a distance though are the deservedly Oscar-winning special effects of Taylor travelling through time in what looks like an easy-chair with an abnormally large sun-shade. The speed-photography showing the passing of time is excellently conveyed and even laced with gentle humour with some fun had at the expense of women's fashion trends going into the future.Less effective are some of the other effects with some very obvious miniatures undercutting the desired effect of some of the disasters which intersperse the narrative. It has to be said too that the creation of a future-love interest with the aptly-named non-entity Weena and pretty much the whole story of the flower children-type Eloi lacks dynamic tension of any kind, even when Rod's rebellion finally rouses them to action. Even so, despite these demerits, the story has a certain natural romanticism and charm which even the most wooden of support acting and background scenery can't altogether deny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason or other the school I went to during 1973-75 occasionally gave us kids a break from lessons and told us all to meet up in the drama studio and watch a film. The school had it's own projector and once the lights were out it was more like a cinema. It happened 3 times and all 3 films have become personal favourites. 'Journey To The Center Of The Earth','Fantastic Voyage' and this 'The Time Machine'. I Absolutely loved this film (and fell in love with Yvette Mimieux!). Rod Taylor is absolutely perfect as George and Alan Young makes a terrific Filby. The story is continually interesting and never dull and the machine itself well, the thing looks like it actually should work!! I owe this film a lot - it made science fiction fantasy my favourite film genre and got me into reading.I was 12 at the time and 'The Time Machine' was the first book I eagerly read - maybe there was some reasoning behind the teachers film 'treats'! Watching the film now is like re-visiting an old friend. It's always been in my top 5 favourite films of all time and I rarely go more than 6 months between viewings, This is probably the film I've seen most and I never tire of it. As a couple of hours pure escapism this film is very hard to beat and as a slice of 60's sci-fi it's unsurpassed in its vision. I cannot recommend this film enough and yes, after all these years I'm still in love with Yvette Mimieux. It's also a lot better than the recent remake. My idea of a perfect Sunday afternoon is to grab a few beers and watch this with the curtains pulled (preferably blowing a gale outside) and just let it take you along for the ride. Perfect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Better Science-Fiction Films of Its Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science-fiction films from the fifties and early sixties, especially those made on a low budget, have a bad reputation today for ludicrous plots and inept special effects. Cheap B-movies such as "Attack of the Fifty-Foot Woman" and Ed Wood's "Plan Nine from Outer Space" are often quoted (and deservedly so) as classics of badness, among the worst ever made. To see all science-fiction from this period as bad, however, would be wrong, as there were also some very fine works made in this genre, such as "Forbidden Planet", the British-made "Village of the Damned" and "The Time Machine".George, a late-Victorian scientist and inventor builds a machine which enables him to travel forward to the future. He witnesses the two world wars and another, fictitious, war in the mid-sixties, fought with nuclear weapons. He then speeds into the far-distant future, around 800,000 AD, when the human race has evolved into two distinct species, the gentle and beautiful but passive Eloi and the Morlocks, a race of brutal, subterranean, subhuman monsters who prey on the Eloi for food. George returns to his own time, but cannot forget the world of the future, especially Weena, the beautiful Eloi girl with whom he has fallen in love, and must decide whether to stay in 1900 or return to the future.There are a number of holes in the plot of the film; some of these are due to Wells, others to the scriptwriters. Although the Eloi have neither government nor laws, and presumably have not had for many thousands of years, they are well aware of what these concepts mean and so are able to tell George "We have no government. We have no laws". In reality, the passive Eloi, with no concept of social cohesiveness or altruism, and no means of either fleeing from the Morlocks or of defending themselves against them, would doubtless have been wiped out altogether. (It seems surprising that Wells, with his interest in Darwinism, ignored the point that a prey species which does not evolve some defence mechanism against its predators is doomed to extinction. Perhaps, like a number of nineteenth and early twentieth century "Darwinists", he was less interested in evolution as a biological mechanism than as evidence in support of his own political and social theories).These plot-holes do not, however, matter too much. The film is not intended as a "realistic" picture of what the distant future might be like. It rather uses its time-travel theme in order to make philosophical points about the nature of twentieth-century society. The film changes some of the concerns of the original novel on which it is based. The novel was written in the 1890s, during the earlier part of Wells's career, when the greatest threat to civilisation, at least from Wells's socialist viewpoint, seemed to be the gulf between the social classes. In the original, therefore, the Eloi are the descendants of the wealthy, leisured class and the Morlocks of the working class. In the 1960s, the greatest threat seemed to be nuclear war, and the film reflects the concerns of its age; the world to which George travels is the direct result of the wars of the twentieth century, with the Morlocks shown as the descendants of those who took refuge in underground shelters and the Eloi of those who somehow survived while remaining on the surface. Those who criticise the film for departing from Wells's vision should be aware that during the later part of his life he too came to see war as the greatest threat to mankind and wrote novels, such as "The Shape of Things to Come", which reflect this preoccupation. Had he rewritten "The Time Machine" in later life, the result might have resembled the plot of the film more closely.I would agree with the reviewer who said that the film does not entirely dispense with Wells's pessimism. The battle of the Eloi and the Morlocks is not one of good against evil. The film is not only warning us of the dangers of war, it is also warning us against the twin evils of bestial violence (symbolised by the Morlocks) and of apathetic passivity (symbolised by the Eloi). A significant episode is when Weena falls into a stream; George rescues her from drowning, but none of the other Eloi will lift a finger to help her. The Eloi may lack the vicious qualities of the Morlocks, but they do not actively possess any good ones. The only hope for their race lies in George, the figure who has come to help them from a more vigorous era in the remote past. There is more to virtue than mere non-violence; in Immanuel Kant's words, if men were as good-natured as sheep, they would still be good-naturedly grazing in the fields.One thing I did not like about the film was the Morlocks who, I felt, should have been more recognisably human, as they represent in symbolic terms negative human qualities. The hairy monsters we saw had an unfortunate whiff of the cheap B-movie about them. Apart from that, I found the film attractively photographed and designed, which well overcame the limitations of its budget. It was also well-acted, especially by Rod Taylor as the idealistic George and the lovely Yvette Mimieux as the innocent Weena. This is one of the better science-fiction films of this era. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and stimulating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this film. I found it to be both entertaining and stimulating. Why so, when reading the several comments contained herein so many die-hard, true-blue sci-fi buffs have slammed it? Well, getting past the charming and beautiful delicate beauty of Yvette Mimieux (and that's not easy to do-- she was and still is quite lovely), and the robust Aussie, Rod Taylor, who we enjoyed in the Birds, VIPs, and other films, the film works. I admit upon reviewing, some of the award-winning effects of 1960 seem cheesy but I recall that they didn't then. Too, sometimes the action seems a bit contrived, but there is the story. We take such things as leaps through time and space for granted these days and forget that Herbert George Wells is often credited with inventing the genre of Science Fiction [my candidate, BTW, is Jules Verne, writing several years before Wells]. The apocalyptic destruction and rebirth with the complacent Eloi and anthropophagic troglodyte Morlocks was the basis of the successful Planet of the Apes, about to reappear with new monkey suits. These issues of self-destruction were at the basis of much of Wells's works, dang near each one a classic in itself. Check out The Island of Dr. Moreau, War of the Worlds, Things to Come and a new soon-to-be released Time Machine. The novellas of Wells were page-turners not only in their Victorian times but when I was a kid. This film moves and the story of death and resurrection is perhaps our greatest mythic journey. Wells's books have not always been successful movies. His Men Like Gods which became the anti-war Things to Come and Island of Dr. Moreau were not great successes. Likewise, his War of the Worlds (another George Pal project) had its problems [never liked Gene Barry anyway]. But this film works. And, hey. Rod Stewart does kinda look like Robin Williams...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>H.G. Wells' anti-war statement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wasn't just a sci-fi about time travel. It was a story born from Wells indictment of the imperialism of his time, and against war, which he thought, ultimately unnecessary, and inhumane.The hints of this, within the movie, are glaring. The Boar War headlines, his stop during the 1st World War, the stop during the Blitz, the supposed Nuclear War in his 1966 stop, the war between the Eloi and the Morlochs.I haven't read Wells, but just from this single movie, I am understanding that he must have been a great writer, and social and political thinker.....even, controversial, to speak out against English policy in the Victorian era.Also, I like the way this movie takes a detached "proper Englishman's" point of view. A person---travelling in time, who thinks himself the pinnacle of propriety and civilization, finding nothing but disorder, madness, and injustice in the futures he sees. The movie truly fits NOW... as it takes place at the turn of the century, and we now again celebrate another turn of the century....but still war against one another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its exciting enough when watching but really doesn't resonate in anyway when over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Time Machine" is a film fondly remembered by many as a science fiction classic. It isn't a masterpiece, but is still entertaining. The main attraction are the special effects, which were quite innovative for the time. Its not really faithful to the source material by H.G. Wells, but its more cinematic and good material for the drive-in or the family. Its essentially a b-film on an a-film budget.For some reason, I found it difficult to really get caught up with the film and came out of it with a slight sense of disappointment. Its exciting enough when watching but really doesn't resonate in anyway when over. Despite all this, the film is very enjoyable. The set design is fantastic and shows real effort. As mentioned earlier, the effects were quite advanced for their time and still manage to awe the viewer today. Even if there's really nothing to the story, the visuals are breath-taking. As the hero, Rod Taylor is serviceable (the role doesn't require any real chops) and makes for a good protagonist. Yvette Mimieux as Weena is beautiful but not really all that great in the acting department. You can't really hate a film such as this though. It was made to entertain, and succeeds in that aspect. Its also at least five times better than the later remake. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to know what happened to the time machine after the movie was shot. Does someone own it or was it scrapped? I would like to know. I have always thought the machine was interesting and it would be a shame to have it junked after the shooting was over. It seemed a lot of work into making this prop. I feel item like these should be given to museums for display. Instead of scrapping these important items, they should be offered to museums for display. I am sure many places would be glad to have a piece of movie history for display. If we can get enough interested people, maybe the movie industry would be willing to pass along these pieces so they are not lost or discarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic, the movie no one would make while Wells was alive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HG Wells wrote his novel when he was only 25, and while he was alive thought it would make the best movie, among all his writing. But it was almost 15 years after his death when "The Time Machine" came out. I was 15, and have seen it a number of times over the years, but it never gets old. A true Sci-Fi classic. It is great fun to muse over the ability to travel forwards and backwards in time, even though our logic tell us it is impossible.Rod Taylor plays the main character and inventor George (H. G. Wells). Set in England at the turn of the 20th century, George tests his machine by traveling forward in time. At first he amuses himself viewing the changing seasons, and the mannequin in the store window across the street. But later he is troubled by world problems he witnesses. First there was world war one, then later in 1966, encounters a destructive satellite. And so it goes.The climax comes when he becomes encased in rock after a destructive war, and has to go many thousands of years until the rocks crumble away and he can see daylight again.SPOILERS FOLLOW. George finds a future race of humans who look like us, speak English (conveniently), but are very meek and afraid of the underground heathens. George befriends pretty Weena (Yvette Mimieux), through her he learns that this people know nothing of the past, and in an old library finds metal rings which, when spun, speak their message. George ends up helping the humans defeat and destroy the heathens, he travels back in his machine, realizes he doesn't really belong in 1900, so travels back to be with Weena and the others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Reality has taken a page from my book and set itself to outdo me." -H.G. Wells</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widely hailed as one of the greatest time travel movies ever made, George Pal's 1960 classic takes astonishing liberties with its source material, not only shortening the story but all but deleting the extensive social commentary in H.G. Wells' novel. The arc of the story is exactly the same as it is in the book, but the necessary simplification that takes place in converting a novel to a film doesn't necessarily remove the meaning, but it definitely dilutes its impact. I read one review in which someone wrote that the pessimism of Wells' novel is lost in the film, which is not entirely true.What is lost is the specification that the Morlocks are the distant descendents of the working class, and the Eloi are the distant descendents of the rich upper class. You still get human descendents killing off other human descendents who have been killing them for food for who knows how long, you just miss the metaphor of the gap between the rich and the poor eventually grows so huge that they kill each other off because of their irreversible inability to coexist.As is also the case in the 2002 remake, the first half of the film is absolutely fascinating, from when the concept of time travel is introduced at the dinner party to the actual traveling through time, which features some surprising special effects showing time pass. What is not quite effective is when the time traveler stops during World War II and we are treated to a display of by far the weakest special effects in the movie, which I only criticize because they are so distantly worse than the other ones in the film. Consider, for example, the amazing effect created as one of the Morlocks decays in a matter of seconds.George has the bad luck only to stop during war, although has one great scene during World War I with the son of his friend Filby who, needless to say, he mistakes for Filby. Next stop is World War II, and then, sick of the times, an astonishing 800,000 years into the future. Good thing he didn't stop around the turn of the millennium to see if people were finally getting along, because he may have found the inspiration to travel far enough ahead in time to witness the sun burning out (as he did in Wells' novel).My biggest complaint about the film is that they got the Eloi so horribly wrong. The Morlocks, too, but at least they got the idea of the Morlocks right. They didn't look anything like they were described in Wells' novel, but they did live underground and were completely intolerant of light, despite their dwelling constantly being brightly lit. The Eloi, on the other hand, not only were not the diminutive people from the novel, who spoke an entirely new language, but they spoke perfect English and even knew what such things as books and laws were, which have been extinct or useless for centuries. And where did those talking rings come from? Technically, the movie is very impressive. Rod Taylor effectively captures the curiosity and the dedication of the Time Traveler, but does go a little overboard with his disgust at learning how much interest in knowledge has decayed in the future civilization that he finds. When he is presented with a whole library of books that have been ignored for so many centuries that they crumble to dust in his hands, he glares at the boy that brought him there and growls, "What have you done!" like it's the poor kid's fault. Yvette Mimieux delivers a performance as Weena that couldn't possibly be less like the Weena in Wells' novel, who saw the Time Traveler as an almost god-like savior, one that she constantly tried to pay tribute to by doing things like picking flowers and placing them in his pockets. She did not see him as her boyfriend and CERTAINLY never asked him if there was a "girl like her" back in his own time.However, there are a lot of deviations from the original novel that have to be allowed given the production limitations. Having the Eloi speak perfect English just seems a little too easy, I guess. In the novel, the Time Traveler gradually learned to communicate in their language. Here, communication is never an issue except when they're under the spell that the Morlocks put them under when they want to lure a lot of them underground for food. George's goal is to get the Eloi to realize what's happening and to fight for themselves. They've become complacent, and we all know that, in the process of evolution, complacency leads to becoming dinner.Having spent most of the film learning about the Eloi and trying to find where his blasted time machine disappeared to, when he finally recovers it he lectures the newly awakened Eloi and travels back to his own time, walking through the door to his own house and into the beginning of the movie. The film ends with another invention for the movie, the idea that George traveled back into the year 802,701 in order to further help the Eloi escape their dismal fate. Rather than showing George travel into the future until the earth grows dark as the sun dims and goes out, we are to assume that he went back to be with Weena. The novel ended with the possibility of sequels, the movie gives itself a clean, happy ending. But hey, it's not like it doesn't work. This is certainly a science fiction classic and wildly entertaining more than 4 decades after its release, the literary version is just a bigger science fiction classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So you think this movie is a CLASSIC?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am mystified by all the adulatory reviews of this film. I recently saw The Time Machine again many years after seeing the original theatrical release when I was a boy. I didn't think much of it then, either.Dated as H.G. Wells's The Time Machine is, it is still a triumph of imaginative fiction. And admirable as George Pal's intention to make it into a film may have been, it does not live up to the book. It is difficult to know whether any successful film could be made that was really true to the book. But even taken on its own terms, this film seems stiff, awkward and lifeless. How much change is "adaptation", and how much is a loss of the whole reason to make a film? In the book, the Time Traveller is a nameless scientist and inventor who travels to the year 802701 for the adventure of discovery. He finds, instead of the scientific Utopia he expected, general decay amidst ancient splendor. The human race has divided in twain: The effete, carefree Eloi, who spend their days in idle, effortless content, and the Morlocks, who live underground, run the great, nameless machines that maintain the world, and whose "remuneration" is the flesh of the Eloi, whom they eat. The book was a vehicle for Wells's reflections on the class system of Victorian Britain at the pinnacle of its imperial power. He was carrying class divisions to a speculative extreme. It occurred at no specific time except the "present." In the film, "George Wells" (very original) is a misanthrope and a pacifist who is sickened by war and violence. On December 31, 1899, he uses his newly completed machine to travel first to the near, and then the far, future. Wells's philosophical and political message is completely abandoned and replaced by a different one entirely: Instead of the British class system, the film is a metaphor for the concerns of 1960: The two recent World Wars and the Cold War. Pal was a Hungarian, after all, and he left Hungary with the rise of Nazism, and moreover the film was made just four years after the Hungarian Uprising of 1956. In the film, the Eloi are the good guys, though weak, and the Morlocks are the Communists, or Soviets: As in the Soviet socialist state, they provide everything but must be obeyed without question and they "devour" their subjects. Unlike the book, where very little changes about the Eloi and Morlocks, in the film, George Wells, the pacifist, leads an uprising in which the Eloi liberate themselves from, overthrow, and destroy the Morlocks, and so must now fend for themselves. Ptui.I remember how dissatisfied I felt with the movie even back then. A film like this, in the days of primitive special effects, really needed a Ben-Hur-sized budget. Pal, however, was famous for making films on small budgets. This film suffers as a result. Although some effects are pretty good, most look pretty cheesy and looked that way even then. Furthermore, square-jawed, ruggedly handsome Australian Rod Taylor never had a very satisfying screen persona. Compare Malcolm McDowell as Wells in "Time After Time"; much more like what was needed in The Time Machine. Here "George" travels 800,000 years into the future and finds that the Eloi all very conveniently speak perfect English. (And American English yet! How perfectly horrid, m'lud!) Although the Eloi never seem to perform any personal toilet, Yvette Mimieux as Weena (so much like 'Weenie' that we laughed) is clean and perfectly coiffed and made up at all times. Alan Young as Filby was pretty amusing to us kids who knew him only as Wilbur in Mr. Ed. (In case you're wondering why Young seemed to disappear from film and TV after that, it was because he gave it all up and became an evangelical Christian in the late 1960s. Oy.) And the Morlocks, far from being scary, caused giggles and snickers among the audience when they appeared. The Morlocks' great machines look like a few cheap props. The richness of Wells's description of the world of 802701 is barely represented in the film. What is perhaps the book's greatest passage, the chapter 'The Further Vision,' in which the Time Traveller journeys 30 million years into the future, is completely missing from the film, and a good thing too, as it would have been impossible to to do well with the special effects technology of the time, and in fact for a long time after that (which is why George Lucas waited 15 years after "Return of the Jedi" to restart the Star Wars film series).So you're interested in H.G. Wells's The Time Machine? Do yourself a favor: Read the book, and forget about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I man travels through time.Since my 1970s childhood, science fiction has always been one of my very top interests and movies like this (and Irwin Allen TV) turned me into a sci-fi nut. In those days there was less sci-fi around so re-runs of movies like The Time Machine were big events.However, over the last 50 years or so just about everything in this film has been re-used or copied and put somewhere else. So part of the flick's impact has now been lost.I am also a very big fan of the 30 episode TV series, The Time Tunnel (1966), and I would advise all followers of this movie to see The Time Tunnel (it even has Time Machine star Whit Bissell in every episode).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Back to the Future their was The Time Machine! Just saw The Time Machine on Turner classics and reminds me of seeing it as a child. My grade 4 teacher let us see the movie while he read the H G Well's book time machine at the same time. The class thought the book was better. Like all great story's, The Time Machine had great material for a story. The Time Machine had a riveting story where the viewer/reader is intrigued and wanting to know more as each scene/chapter evolves. The special effects stood up well. The acting was anything but corny. The endings much more positive than the book. Being a English lit major, one sees the class conflict in the book, and why the two groups cannot co-exist. For a movie made in the 1960's, it is better than many movies made today. 8 out of 10 for time travel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Why this preoccupation with time?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must be said that one has to be ambitious to tackle a literary giant like H.G. Wells. This master has crafted works that persist as classics more than 50 years after his death. Never one to shy away from heavy themes, H.G. Wells' work is one that would unnerve me to explore on film. Nonetheless, The Time Machine (1960) directed by George Pal brings Well's words to life on screen. Tackling such heavies as class, society, and modernization, The Time Machine fails to disappoint in either format.The Time Machine starts out as another backwards tale, which I am quite partial to. We meet a group of friends in a dining hall when a disheveled scientist George (Rod Taylor) arrives with unkempt hair and tattered clothes. He is visibly shaken at first, and then begins to explain to his friends about his unique travels. Having met his friend Filby's (Alan Young) son on his travels, he is especially interested in telling him his stories. George didn't just take any trip, he traveled through time. As Filby and George previously discussed, George has a preoccupation with time. He believes he has been born to the wrong time, and because of this feeling, devotes his scientific research to trying to manipulate time. George hopes to discover a utopia in the future in which minds are celebrated and innovation encouraged. On the eve of the 20th century, his time machine finally works and George sets out, cautiously, to explore the future he will never know. After gingerly going hours then weeks in the future, George has made up his mind to travel hundreds of years. When he finally lands, many thousands of years into the future, George is greeted with a civilization of sheep, all following one another with no knowledge of how their government works or if they even have one. George is optimistic to find that war and famine are worries of the past, but disheartened when he is taken to the "library" of the civilization to see all the books being stored there crumbling to dust. George is devastated to learn that the utopia he was so sure to find is actually a dystopia. These people are called Eloi, and at first assumption look as though they lead care-free lives, once the city becomes dark however, we can see that is far from the truth. The Eloi actually live in constant fear of the Morlocks, a group that provides the Eloi with clothes and nourishment, as well as periodic population control. Blindly following the Morlocks' command, George is committed to showing the eloi that they needn't be under the Morlock's control, even if that means rescuing them himself.The Time Machine has been hailed for its use of special effects, which were way ahead of their time. It only makes sense that a film about traversing time would have effects that also superseded it. As George firsts experiments with his machine and is dancing through the hours and the days, we see the flowers in his garden rapidly grow and die again. Seeing the flowers blooming and retracting was a nice special effects tool for the audience to witness. We also see in George's travels, the earth succumbing to a fierce magma. I do not know how this magma was created, but its thickness and texture was incredibly realistic. When we see George pitted against the Morlocks we see that they all have beaming eyes. This effect was also interesting considering it was 1960. These effects today would all be easy to create, but considering this film was made almost 60 years ago, they were definitely ahead of their time.H.G. Wells was noted for his exploration of themes that concern the human condition. This film definitely fits into that category. Civilization is greatly explored, as George is certain that the future will only produce advancements for society. When he sees that the future society has devolved to such a great extent, he learns that advancement does not always produce a positive outcome. Modernization is also explored as we learn with George that production means are irrelevant if the human mind stops growing. Finally, the most blatant issue explored in The Time Machine is class. We are introduced to two classes, producers and consumers. The consumers are subservient and completely dependent upon the producers. The producers are shown to be ugly, nonhuman like creatures, while the consumers are beautiful, yet the exact same as one another. One can draw the conclusion that, as we see the producers coming up from underground in which they live that the production of society is the grunt work done only to preserve itself. Even though the Morlocks are hideous and primitive, the Eloi live in constant fear of them, yet completely dependent upon them for everything with which to sustain life. They also live in blissful ignorance about what they are missing out on, unrestricted life. Clearly, Wells reserves no love for the producers; even classifying them as cannibalistic. This film does wonders to show the dangers of submitting to a ruling class of producers and warns one to always maintain individuality.I quite enjoyed The Time Machine, and would recommend this version to anyone who enjoys any of H.G. Well's works. I also would recommend this film to fans of the sci-fi genre. It is interesting to see the early workings of such a prolific genre, and to see the special effects achieved by a film of this nature. Something about this film felt very nostalgic and comfortable for me. I am not sure why I felt a kinship to this film, as I have never before seen a film like it. For that reason alone, I would also recommend this movie as it exists as a cautionary tale of maintaining individuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic, Beautiful Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Victorian Englishman travels to the far future and finds that humanity has divided into two hostile species.I cannot say that I am terribly familiar with the original story. I am, however, somewhat familiar with the remake. Although that was not bad, you simply cannot beat the charm of this original.What I liked most was the progressive move forward in time, first by minutes, then years, and then many thousands of years. That was much more interesting than just jumping to the distant future and the Morlocks. The son who looks exactly like his father? Brilliant. And by setting it in Victorian England rather than 1960, the jump ahead could be accomplished with a true history... at least for the first fifty years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've often wondered if the creators of the teleseries DR. WHO were inspired by THE TIME MACHINE by H.G. Wells. It seems like a logical assumption, eh? This Big Screen version remains the finest cinematic adaptation to date- by far. Rod Taylor does a commendable job as "George," our time-traveling hero, but the REAL stars, of course, are the man-eating Morlocks (whose buck-toothed look may well have inspired the look of the title character in the Bernie Wrightson-rendered CREEPY classic, JENIFER, which Dario Argento adapted for the teleseries MASTERS OF HORROR). While the Morlocks aren't on screen for very long (this entire segment of the movie only lasts about 20 minutes, total, and the Morlocks are only featured for a small portion of THAT), they're most memorable: with eyes that literally glow in the dark, they lay in wait for the hapless Humans of the far-flung future, emerging to crack their whips and drive the Homo Saps into waiting ovens- truly the stuff of nightmares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There just has to be a future in time travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the day I often wished that I could travel back in time, especially to around the first time I saw this movie in the mid-'60's ? carefree days only in retrospect, probably only full of worry concerning schooltime though. Finally seeing a HD copy tonight helps recall but unfortunately it can't help remove the age patina from over the retina ? this was an entertaining family film that is set in the amber of its time - permissiveness, cynicism and cgi have ruined us all for all time.Rod Taylor handsomely plays a far too clever chap with plenty of time on his hands who invents a rather static time machine because he's disgruntled with the world of 1899 that he lives in; he wants to find some kind of Utopia in the future. After all, it's probably much easier than co-operating with other people to try to create a Utopia in the present. He ends up 800,000 years in the future on the side of a wimpy acquiescent race of blondes up against some big ugly cannibal blondes with no thumbs. The delicious bookend scenes at the beginning and end of the film at his house chatting with his dense incredulous guests remain and will remain into the foreseeable future some of my all-time comfort scenes ? I never cared about the sometimes laughable special effects or any of the many errors in the film. If the guests left the house on New Years Eve at 6pm to a noonday Sun, so what? I even find it incredible that I checked some of the goofs listed on IMDb frame by frame for accuracy without worrying that it would spoil the film for me ? it wouldn't. It's an engrossing hoary piece of middle-brow hokum that has stood the test of time: people still watch it and appreciate it with all its faults, and will do so well into the future. I wonder if it was ever remade, but then again who cares? To come clean: it maybe helps that I never cared too much for H. G. Wells, I think I enjoyed reading Tono-Bungay more than any other of his novels. His Time Machine was much worthier than this film of course, far more thoughtful and logical but also dour and polemical, and ultimately less entertaining. Also any human being who supports a vast legal slaughter of various working class people of various capitalist countries on various battlefields for their various Masters is not someone I could ever let myself admire.One big sign of a film I enjoy is that its running time whizzes by without my looking - in fact time flies - this is one film I can watch time and time again without loss of enjoyment, and do. George Pal made the film for his audiences of 1960 and H. George Wells wrote the book for his audiences of 1895, in that sense nothing and nothing only is timeless. We're all prisoners of our own times: you may have your comfort films, this is definitely one of mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time Machine (1960) -- A Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Time Machine" is not a great film, but it is fun to watch. English Victorian inventor H. George Wells (Rod Taylor), after expressing his understandable disillusionment with present to David Filby (Alan Young), travels into the future to discover what mankind has done with its overly efficient weapons of war. Needless to say, George does not like what he finds. He first witnesses the brutal slaughter of human beings in two World Wars. This film, released just two years before the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, also exploits the tense atmosphere of the Cold War by suggesting that mankind was also insane enough to wage nuclear wars. Having witnessed air strikes with nuclear bombs, George travels even further into the future presumably to the 50th century where he learns of the terrible consequences of nuclear war: the disintegration of "civilization" and the emergence of two primitive cultures. One of these cultures lives happily on the earth's surface and does not engage in any physical labour, though now and then they had to put up with seeing some of their member disappear underground forever during air raid sirens. The second lives underground and has a dark secret.This film can be read in one of two ways. It works as an entertainment, as we satisfy our curiosity about what it's presumably like for a man to travel far into the future in his time machine. On a somewhat more subtle level, the "Time Machine" is also an anti-war film that takes issue particularly with the increasingly destructive weapons of war that are being invented. At one point, George returns back to Victorian England in order to warn his good friends about the terrible consequences that would befall "civilization" as a result of the current arms race between the great western powers. These friends scoff at the idea that George even travelled to the future, to say nothing of being a witness to the destruction of "civilization" at the hands of terrible weapons such as the nuclear bomb. As a result, George sees no hope for the human race in his own time and travels to the 50th century in order to help the people on the surface build a new and hopefully better civilization. In short, what "The Time Machine" is saying is that most human beings in the 20th century are incredibly short sighted, because they used science and technology to hasten their own destruction rather than make the world a better place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember being genuinely scared by this movie as a kid, and finding it really compelling and immersive. After revisiting it as an adult, I was glad to find that it still had a lot of charm and power to it.Obviously the effects are a bit dated, but dated in a way that I think still retains production value. In fact I'd say a lot of times these old-school special effects hold up a lot better than some of the late-90s / early 2000s CGI, which looks like terrible pixelated garbage.The performances in this movie also have a sort of old-school charm to them, and while maybe not academy award material at times, the believability of the premise of a time machine is never really stretched for me, and I think that has a lot to do with the performances.This is another movie that I question the remake of; I think the original was fine, and if they were going to remake it they should have done a better job than they did, or left it alone entirely.I recommend this movie, and tell my friends who haven't seen it to check it out. I've been told more than once that in spite of someone not having seen it as a kid (and thereby not really having any nostalgia value to go off) they still enjoy this and find it compelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the films I have loved in my life, this has been my favorite and undoubtedly, the most watched. It is strange that for the role of George (The Time Traveller) who was supposed to be the epitome of an English Gentleman, they chose, both in this and the later version of the film, an Australian to play the part.Although it is no fault of the Director, George Pal, who did a magnificent job, there is one thing that always bothered me about the story: By destroying the Morlocks, they in fact cut off the supply of food which the Eloi seemed incapable of providing for themselves. Still putting my over-analytical gripe aside, I find this is a film I never get tired of watching, (even if I am sometimes falling asleep whilst listening to it, as I know every scene of the film so well.) I thoroughly recommend it for any audience. 10/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One image worth a thousand words, a thousand years ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I discovered the 'Time Machine' when I was 9, long before I'd be familiar with the Time Machine concept, as if I was on the same wavelength than the audience in 1960, and once the magic of the first travel is over, there is more about dystopian future in that Sci-fi film than Time Travel itself There is no doubt that the ultimate movie about 'Time Travel', the one that tackled its subject with the closest approach to scientific accuracy is and will forever be "Back to the Future", but let's give H.G. Wells the credits he deserved for having pioneered the most defining Sci-Fi sub-genre. Defining is the word for Science-Fiction can be seen as simple immersion in a futuristic world resulting from the progresses of science. This is the existential reason to be of Sci-fi, and the same spirit that drives the hero of this unforgettable journey, Dr. George Wells, played by the suave, athletic and handsome Rod Taylor in his debut role.Although a faithful adaptation of the literary classic of the same name, written by H.G. Wells, "The Time Machine", directed by George Pal, took a smart advantage from its chronological advance to enrich the original material with two halts in the years1917 and 1966. In 1917, George mistakes Filby Jr. (Alan Young) for his father, only to find out that his dear friend died in World War I, coincidentally, he also meets Filby half a century later when London is at the edge of a Nuclear Holocaust. These encounters cleverly illustrate the most thrilling aspects of time travels, where the same person can age in one blink of an eye, from the travelers' perspective. It also avoids one common mistake made in Time Travels, even in "Back to the Future" (Part II to be precise) where one person goes to the future and encounters his future self. In "Time Machine", George finds out the house owner mysteriously disappeared, which is the perfect illustration of George's theory that Time is a fourth dimension that can be used to locate an object. As a person or an object can't be in different places in the same time, they all logically can't be in different times in the same place. In "Back to the Future"'s logic, there were 4 De Loreans on November 12, 1955, in "The Time Machine", such logic wouldn't work.But the Time theories occupies a very small space in the story and the purpose of H.G. Wells, was truly to embrace men's natural curiosity toward the future, how will humanity evolve? For better or for worse? Will we even exist in one thousand years? Needless to say, that Wells has a particularly dark vision of the future, to which the steps in the first World War work like a gripping omen. In 1966, George arrives right before Nuclear Holocaust would put an end to civilized world, as we know it. I can imagine how scarily prophetic the sight of lava destroying London could have affected an audience at the eve of the Cold War. But people were old enough to still have the devastating effect of World War II in mind, and when Barbarity culminated with the Nazi horrors and the nuclear bombing of civilians, nothing was ever impossible. Not even the End of the Worlds, It's all natural that the same author of 'the War of the Worlds' would figure the end of ours coming from an internal one. George Pal intelligently parallels the book's plot with historical facts. And it works.The first twist occurs when after the nuclear fallout, George is trapped in a mountain of solidified lava and must wait until 802 701 to finally be free and finds himself in a sort of Eden where two civilizations cohabit, although the word 'civilization' is too much. The Eloi are young blonde-faired humans, who live in peace and idleness, I guess the Censorhip wouldn't allow to show if they reproduce, but we get the idea. This is where George meets the beautiful Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and the film doesn't lose time in its romance. The encounter allows to show how little, or backward civilization have advanced, which maybe from our perspective isn't perhaps the worst-case scenario. It gets interesting on an Orwellian level when George discover that they're bred by the Morlocks who eat them, to ensure their own survival. As a child, I remember being pretty scared by the Morlocks, who're probably some of the ugliest and scariest creatures ever portrayed on screen. I could barely watch the TV when they were in and couldn't wait for the climax to go, and for George to get back. At this time, there isn't much time left for philosophical questioning, the film is an action film and Taylor, a heroic fearless hero. That's not the most interesting bit of the film.The best is still to come in the ending and the way it assembles the beginning by proving George's theory right about Time as a fourth dimension. Indeed, if "Back to the Future" was the film that popularized the concept of butterfly effect, "Time Machine" respects the idea that you can move on different times but find yourself in the same place. The device also serves the ending where a simple change of movement is explained by George's friends, the only one, among his friends, to understand him. This idea is not only original, and fully detailed, but it also allows understanding the process of the Time Machine, a machine that moves in time keeping a view on the outside. The director, George Pal, a pioneer of animation has a great and poetic way to show time lapses with the image of a mannequin in a clothes shop changing her fashion as time goes by, and some clever use of lights. In Cinema, an image is said to be worth a thousand words, in Time Machine it even goes to thousand years.</fullReview>

I won't even try to count the times that I've watched Time After Time, Life on Mars, Ashes to Ashes and the different versions of The Time Machine. Before I digress too far off the subject of this review... The Time Machine (1960) is a true classic. It's even suitable for family viewing and is entertaining for an audience of all ages. Even though we all know that Britain and the world wasn't destroyed in 1966, I still love this movie (and must admit that I'm disappointed by the lack of reviews). Despite whatever flaws one can find, I still give The Time Machine (1960) my rave review because it delivers what movies are supposed to deliver: entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to confess that when I first saw this movie in the mid 60' I had one of my first crushes on a movie star, Yvette Mimieuix who plays Weena in this classic sci-Fi movie. Yvette was simple looking in this movie, but that is what made her stand out. It just goes to show that you do not need lots of make-up to impress somebody.Now Rod Taylor, he was the ideal man that we all wanted to grow up to become. He was not afraid to take chances or stand up to others who ridiculed him and his goals, not to mention that he was pretty well set for money. Just watching him act, we all wanted to have his casual self awareness that he could portray.This movie still stands out as the best film to date, as the remake doesn't even come close to it. The scenery was simple but acceptable for the time that this film was created. I still enjoy watching this movie every year along with the other classics.As a young Sci-Fi movie enthusiast, this movie allowed me to believe that I was George Wells experiencing everything that he felt, smelled, touched. Why did time fly, and what happened to the world that I was skipping through? You have to watch this film with the eyes of a youngster and their ability to believe without seeing.</fullReview>

I am a history buff, so the concept of time travel makes that subject an even more appealing one to me. While the acting is not picture perfect nor the special effects perfect, and the fact that the world did not end in 1967 were not a detraction for me at all. George Pal created a film of wonder and possibilities. The movie's message and ending is neither really happy nor tragic, but leaves you thinking about humanity's future.

		<shortDescription>"Which three books would you have taken?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were a myriad of reasons for viewers in 1960 to be wary of a cinematic adaptation of H.G. Wells' timeless science fiction parable The Time Machine, despite its dramatic adventure storyline suggesting perfect fodder for an enthralling movie experience. Nonetheless, no matter how dramatic the storyline, the concern would remain, as with many such literary adaptations, that the translation would either remain overly wordy and suffer cinematically as consequence, or, through an attempt to "Hollywoodize" the text, overly deviate from what made the source material such a success. Similarly, even with recent advances in special effect technology, it would be easy to see the power of the novel diluted through campy, sub par visual effects, even for viewers at the time. A final fear would have been that, given the general trend of movies attempting to be "bigger and better" to lure viewers away from their television sets, the philosophical and introspective dimensions of Wells' text would be lost in favour of showy spectacle. However, as miraculous it may seem, director George Pal's The Time Machine, while far from a perfect film, manages to refute all of the aforementioned concerns and still excel as a highly enjoyable product of its time.Like most classic science-fiction films made during the cold war era, the film ends up morphing into a non-violence morality play (a poignant statement is made when Wells stops his time machine twice in a row, in 1917 and 1940, believing the same war to still be going on), but despite the supposedly cheery Technicolor trappings, dares to push the envelope to envision a particularly bleak future tantalisingly close to the external real life context of the time, predicting worldwide nuclear destruction only six years after the movie's release. However, there is an ironic inconsistency in such an anti-violence message, considering that during the climactic segment taking place in the extreme future (the year 80,000) it is only through the time travelling Wells' introducing the notion of violence to the naive, childlike race of human descendants, the Eloi, that they can finally rise above their cannibalistic Morlock oppressors. This climactic end battle also leads to a vaguely troublesome moral stance when considering the savage Morlocks are also descendants of current day humans, making Wells' instant opposition to them akin to a form of racial discrimination when taken out of context. David Duncan's screenplay, while delivering a reasonably faithful adaptation of H.G. Wells' source text filled with appropriate gravitas and awed astonishment, also works in moments of satire and humour, some welcome (an ironic comment on the dawning of capitalism is made by Wells' companions discounting his astonishing time machine invention due to its having no immediate commercial or military use) and some less welcome (a cringe-worthy, out of place and overlong joke as supposedly childlike Weena asks how women wore their hair in the year 1900). Despite being a mostly sturdy piece of writing, the film does come across as being occasionally clunky and poorly paced, and there is an interesting attempt to shoehorn in a happy ending out of what, upon further reflection, actually comes across as quite bleak. Nonetheless, the film denotes a landmark in the evolution of cinematic special effects, with early usage of time lapse photography serving well to depict the time travelling effect (if only director Pal had resisted the urge to accompany it with a gruesomely asinine sound effect), and the expansive sets and props (the immortal design of the sled-like titular machine itself being the highlight) add an acceptably enthralling tinge to the adventure aspect of the film, making The Time Machine, despite the occasional fumbling of thematic material, far too enjoyable to resist. Rod Taylor brings a suitable Victorian pompousness as well as impassioned lust for discovery and knowledge as the time travelling H.G. Wells surrogate, his spunky charisma and frantic bursts of enthusiasm carrying the film with ease. Making her film debut, Yvette Mimieux, despite subscribing to the school of "if you can't act, look good", makes the most out of shallowly written Eloi love interest Weena, with her occasional sparks of energy and charm denoting an acting talent beyond one worthy of being dismissed due to her looks. Finally, Alan Young is both boisterously charming and appropriately foreboding as Wells' 'voice of reason' figure friend and his own son (in the future), working with the potentially cumbersome pseudo-profundity of the subject matter with a comfortable confidence. Despite the occasional patchy logic or ethics of the film, Pal's moments of thematic daring or simple willingness to let the film ride along in an enjoyable and occasionally thought provoking manner, make the film a hit, albeit if it boasts such an earnest immediacy that its Technicolor audience baiting excesses do sometimes get the better of it. Nonetheless, The Time Machine results as an overall highly satisfying and watchable version of Wells' classic tale, if not the genre cornerstone it could have been. -8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie from the 1960s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie several times. It's one that I can't help but sit and watch whenever it is on. THE TIME MACHINE won an Oscar for Visual Effects. Having seen the movie, I think they got it for effort more than results. Of course a huge amount of work went into the film since a large portion of it is done using time-lapse and stop-motion photography to show the passing of time but the overall effect makes it seem very similar to Czechoslovakian filmmaker Karel Zeman's work. This is not a bad thing. The special effects often don't seem very realistic but they are interesting to look at, probably because they are not very realistic. Some of the miniatures are out of focus in places making them dead giveaways but I suspect there wasn't enough light to carry depth of field in the high-speed photography and not due to any lack of expertise on the part of Wah Chang, Gene Warren and Tim Baar. This was also the first professional work of Jim Danforth who would later go on to be nominated for two Oscars for his work. It's an entertaining enough movie although the budget seems pretty low for the subject matter but in spite of this, I'll take this movie any day over the lame 2002 remake. Other high points are a beautiful, wistful score by Russell Garcia (preserved on a soundtrack album that is available) and great co-stars like Sebastian Cabot and Whit Bissell and the beautiful Yvette Mimieux (sorry, not sure I spelled that right) looking quite hot back in the day. Rod Taylor is fine as the time traveler. Excellent cinematography by Paul Vogel and the Morlock make ups are quite creepy. George Pal tried to get a sequel made and it's a shame he was never able to do it because a follow up to this movie would have been nice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. Rod Taylor was great, as he usually is. I especially liked the look at London after a nuclear attack in 1966. Since this movie was produced in 1960, 1966 was the future for them and they added a nuclear attack while George was visiting with Filby Jr. Then I thought the video did a nice job of re-creating HG Wells look into the future with the Eloi and the Warlocks. I also liked the way the Eloi reacted to the girl that was drowning. At first, George thought the land he had discovered was paradise. Then Weena was drowning and his perception of the New World he had found changed. I also thought it was interesting the way the Eloi reacted to the arrival of a new person, where they ignored him completely. Overall, it was a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.G. Wells is a very very good writer. Of course I have never read any of his books but I have seen several of the movies based upon THE novels. But I must say this "The Time Machine" was indeed a very good film. I couldn't put down time from the movie I just saw because of a few minor errors from other "Time Machine" movies of what I have seen before. Some good and some bad but I have to say that this movie was the best one I have ever seen before. So if I have voted from OTHER "Time Machine" films they would of been lower than 8. From the end of this 1960's version, I think it made a good impression of why he left again from 1900. I don't think he would go back to the 800000 century but he probably went back close by with those three books so he can meet everyone else before the Eloies took control of the people "mind". He probably wanted to go back in time to teach all of the "future" wise people; the ones that never age, never had rules, never had laws, etc. George probably went back in time to show and TEACH (once again of saying that) them about the history of mankind's Reality.....Of where he lived in the 20th century. But all and all I think that this movie was very well played out.</fullReview>

Wells "The War of the Worlds" (one of my favorites until today too), but "The Time Machine", based on a novel by H.G. Wells too, is surely Pal's pinnacle. Pal stay very close to the book, changed and shortened only some things, to align the story to the media of film. All of this changes, i.e. Weena was rescued by the Time traveler, but died in the book, worked very good for the movie-version. The complete time-travel of the time traveler (unnamed in Wells book, but Pal hand over the honor of being the time-traveler to H.G. Wells himself in the movie) looks eerie, fantastic, poetic, lyrical, but absolutely plausible and believable until today, even if you know, that there was no nuclear war in 1966. It is not only a simple travel trough time, but trough the hopes and the fears of mankind too. This eerie, but believable feeling was strengthen by the fantastic score, composed by Russell Garcia. He did not only play "some fitting" music-parts for every scene, he merged the score completely with the scenes. Every scene has it's own theme. And he used a lot of orchestral effects instead of normal sound-effects, i.e the sound-part that symbolized the travel and the rotating dish of the time-machine. A perfect fusion of pictures, action, mood and music in every detail. The world of the year 802701 looks first like a dream, it is unreal yet believable too. Garcia adds again his fantastic score, simulating the eerie sounds of the unseen creatures that lived in this future far away from us. In fact, you get a glimpse of the last 800 centuries that passed away when George visit the library and listen to the emotionless talking rings. And the ruins oft the buildings in the future... When George first saw the destroyed giant dome, accompanied by Garcias majestic, crescendo score again...absolutely perfect! It send cold shivers down my spine during every watching this scene. The Eloi, unchanged in it's figure from humans of today, looking like innocent children on the first view, but that something must have changed reveals when the Morloks appear, the dark side of the human nature. And, perhaps this was the intention of the filmmakers (and H.G. Wells too), to show the two human races of the future that seems to be the dividing of the human spirit in it's two parts: The innocent, bright side, and the hidden, dark side.So the first so simple looking plot of a travel trough time covers a lot of more deep meanings in it. During every viewing the film reveals more of it's genius to me. It is one of the very seldom movies that stand alone for its own: unique, timeless (no pun intended), unforgettable: A real masterpiece! Mr. Pal, thank you for this wonderful movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Time Machine" is the perfect demonstration that you don't necessarily need a big budget or top stars to make a good entertaining movie.Based on H.G.Welles's book, the film shows George / Wells (Rod Taylor), back at the turn of the 20th century, having invented a strange machine that allows him to travel to the past or the future. He chooses the far future and ends up many centuries ahead in a rather primitive society -the Eloi- that lives only for pleasure and fun.(or so it seems). The man is curious about evolution and ties up with Weena (Ivette Mimieux) a pretty native girl that is a perfect model of her kind. Real action and interest increases when George finds out who and why make such an easygoing life for the Eloi. It is the Morlocks a weird subrace that lives in caverns and tunnels beneath the surface and are the complete opposite to the Eloi. Why they take such good care of the Eloi is one of the picture's main ingredients.With little money but a good script, perfect settings, impressive make up (for 1960) and a bunch of fine actors, George Pal brings an unquestionably entertaining film that even includes message about mankind stupidity and dangerous behaviours.Rod Taylor takes his part seriously and is excellent as the time voyager; Ivette Mimieux puts a valuable feminine touch in a not very demanding role. Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot and Whitt Bissell (a regular in Sci Fi 50's films) are very convincing as George's friends back home who find hard to believe -who could blame them?- his pretended achievements.This is a simple unpretentious movie most enjoyable and entertaining in its genre. There was no need for the recent 2002 remake.Asure high rank for Sci Fi fans and not so fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forty-six years on, and it is still incredible...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year 1960, the age of the family drama was ending, and one of the many genres competing to replace it was science fiction. At the time, sci-fi was populated by greats who still have yet to be equalled in their ability to make the impossible seem a matter of course. Although Heinlein was somewhat more prolific, Wells has been adapted to the silver screen far more frequently. The era Wells worked in was one of great wonder and great fear, the end of the nineteenth century and the beginnings of the twentieth. In these times, Wells must have seen so many wondrous and bizarre creations from other men, but one wonders exactly what he would think of the adaptations made of his most recognised fictions. Had he lived to see George Pal's interpretation of The Time Machine, he may well have been pleased, both with himself and that there was an imagination in Hollywood capable of translating the words he thought up into such striking images. As my summary says, even forty-six years of ageing has done nothing to reduce the extraordinary quality of this film.Like all of the Wells novels I have read, The Time Machine apparently focuses on men daring to dream and using their intelligence to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The dreamer in this case is a scientist pretty much interchangeable with Wells himself, and the obstacles are an ingrained sense of apathy along with a simple not knowing any better. The film begins with an exhausted, dishevelled Wells relating a story to colleagues. In an early experiment, he builds a small machine that can travel through time, but is only big enough to carry a cigar. After his experiment is met with skepticism and culture shock by these colleagues, he begins testing a full-scale version of the machine, and thus begins some of the most striking effects shots of the era. Snails move as fast as sports cars, flowers bloom and wither in mere seconds, while the ravages of time beat down buildings as quickly as they are built. Clever uses of time-lapse photography make these early establishing sequences a delight to watch.Our hero makes a few quick stops on his journey to see what the future holds for humanity. At the time the film was released, the Vietnam war was still looming over the horizon, so the prediction of an all-consuming, presumably nuclear, war in 1966 was a bit off. Nonetheless, after spending thousands of years inside a mountain formed from lava, Wells' proxy comes to a stop in the eight-hundredth century, and thus the real meat of the story begins. At first, he finds himself surrounded by vegetation that could only have been conceived by an early believer in the flower power movement. When he finds people, he is at first bemused by their seeming tranquility, but shocked by their complete apathy towards their own, and each other's, lives. Saving a woman from drowning as her fellows look on in a seemingly apathetic stupor, the hero joins them for a meal and begins asking where he might find knowledge to answer his questions about their society. Shown a library that has fallen into decay, he angrily storms off, thinking his hosts a pathetic host of apathetic miscreants.Regarding their society, however, he soon gets more answers than he bargains for when he tries to return to his machine, only to find that someone has taken it inside the concrete bunker he parked it near. The woman he rescued earlier comes to talk to him, and he builds a fire for them to sit around. When his back is turned, however, we are introduced to the mysterious other element of this weird new world that keeps it working. Dragged away by a strange green-skinned creature, our heroine is only rescued when our hero shows a propensity to use his fists that serves him well later in the story. Searching for a way to recover his machine, our hero is eventually told by the heroine that there exists a building in which rings exist. Taking these rings and spinning them, our hero learns the unsettling truth that humanity nearly succeeded in destroying itself, and the survivors split into two groups. The dazed and listless tribe he encountered on the surface are the descendants of those who took their chances on the surface, but dear art, learning what the other group consisted of was a real moment.With the background information that these ugly, green-skinned monsters that seemingly only come out at night are descended from those who fled the surface in favour of underground shelter, the moment comes when an air-raid siren is used to hypnotise the surface dwellers into coming underground. Chasing them through the shelter by an alternate entrance, our hero learns that the underworld creatures have been feeding, clothing, and building for the surface dwellers for one sole purpose. To use them as a food supply. The moment when we zoom in on model skeletons as our hero learns this fact could have gone horribly wrong, but Rod Taylor's narration really sells it. Inspired to action, the hero battles the underground Morlocks with fists and fire until the Eloi finally begin to snap out of their stupor and join the battle. What keeps the memory of this film fresh in the viewer's mind, however, is the final moments where the hero decides to adopt the eight-thousandth century as his home and, as Alan Young says so well, help the Eloi build themselves a better world.I could go on for hours about how wonderful this film is, but really, all you need to know is that it is a ten out of ten masterpiece. The remake in 2002 confirms that you just cannot improve on perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Time Machine, a Brilliant Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine is an excellent film that follows the book by H.G Wells.A Professor called George invents a Time Machine and shows his model and design to David Filby and his other friends before they all leave and he sets out in it. Taking to the future he stops during World War 1 to chat with David Filby's son James Filby and heads, (coincidence don't you think), to a random date that turns out to be World War 2 where he sees a plane through the roof of his now overgrown laboratory and he stops in 1966 to a 3rd War which involves nuclear satellites and he notices Filby who is now in a metal armoured suit, Filby comments on how he never aged one bit. The missile hits and everyone hurries for the shelters as the ground breaks open and lava flows down the street, (in outdated effects but this is 1960 right?), George hurries for the Time Machine as millions of people hurry for the shelters and George goes on through nuclear disasters until the wars stop and everything seems peaceful and quiet. There is a stream and a temple full of fruit and books that crumble to dust but most of all there is the Eloi, the race that the humans that managed to stay on the surface during the nuclear war and lava flow evolved to. George's Time Machine is gone and he befriends a Eloi woman called Weena but she gets took by the rulers of the underground shelters who use the dumber Eloi as their cattle. It turns out that Filby and the others that retreated underground turned into cannibal monsters that dwelled underground and became troll-like, the Morlocks. George goes down and after a battle with the Morlocks discovers their weakness, fire. He frees the Eloi and whilst running through the caves back to the surface, he kills the Morlocks and they all escape. George goes back into his Time Machine to say goodbye to his friends back at home as he is returning to Weena's time for a while, (but he can still visit other times, unlike the remake), he then realises he is heading for the future not the past. According to the book, the furure involves a dying red Sun on a beach and Giant Crabs instead of humans, then the Sun turns supernova and expands to destroy the Earth, but a quick adjusting of the levers means he goes back to the past before returning to the future."There's a place called tomorrow, a place of joy not of sorrow, can't you see, it's the place for you and me!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fantasy film. No masterpiece but not a Drive-In movie either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a television staple when I was growing up in the 1960's and I always looked forward to it coming on TV. George Pal directs in only the second film of his short feature film directorial career. He had been a cartoon director/cinematographer and went into film producing where he turned out some of the classic sci-fi 50's movies like War of the Worlds, When Worlds Collide, Conquest of Space and destination Moon. For H.G. Welles' The Time Machine he got David Duncan to write the screenplay. Duncan had written a lot of mostly forgettable monster movies like The Monster That Challenged the world, The Thing That Couldn't Die, The Black Scorpion, Monster on Campus and The Leech Woman. This film's editor was the respected George Tomasin, a favorite of Alfrd Hitchcock who edited Hitchcock's films Psycho, The Birds, Vertigo, Rear Window, North by Northwest, The Man Who Knew too Much, The Wrong Man and To Catch a Thief. Veteran Hollywood Cinematographer Paul Vogel photographed this film. Rod Taylor is excellent as the Victorian era time traveler who builds a time machine out of a chaise lounge and leaves behind his comfortable Mannor and embarks on a fantastic trip 800,000 years into the future with a couple of stops in the 20th century. It is in the 20th century where he runs into a nuclear war that causes a problem which forces him to leap hundreds of millenia into the future. In the supporting cast is Yvette Mimieux as Weena, his love interest of the future where despite the great passage of time people still speak English. Also in the cast his Alan Young in his pre Mr. Ed days as well as Sebastian Cabot who would become best known as Mr. French on Family Affair. Veteran actors Tom Helmore and Whit Bissell round out the cast. Gene Warren and Tim Baar won an Academy Award for their special affects. It's a well produced movie and enjoyable fantasy and although not a cinematic masterpiece it's no Drive-In movie either. I would give it an 8.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made some 25 years before my birth, this magical favourite is sure to entertain and enlighten people for years to come.It is the first (and best) adaptation of H.G. Wells' novel of the same name. It tells the story of a successful inventor named George (Australian, Rod Taylor) living in the year 1900. He is an intelligent young man whose curiosity is piqued by the trappings of time-travel. Thus, he builds a whirly-gig machine that allows him to travel freely through time. Eventually, he ends ups in the year 800,000 where the world is a very different place. A green paradise that masks a terrible affliction - the human race (over the many years) has evolved into two different species: the peaceful Eloi, and the savage Morlock. Our hero time-traveller must intervene to stop this monstrosity. The travelling sequences through time are quite amazing to put it simply. Full of rich colours and nostalgic, dazzling effects. The Morlock costumes have the same, nostalgic feel. The acting is top-notch. Rod Taylor is especially great.See this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rod Taylor plays George, a man who has invented a time machine.He's going to test if his machine works, but before he does that, he wants to tell his friends about the machine.They find the story hard to believe.There can't be a machine that takes you to the past when you pull the lever and to the future when you push the lever.But there is.Our friend gives it a try.And it works!He travels to the future.He makes a few stops along the way until he stops in the year 802,701.There he meets simple people called Eloi, who live in a paradise.Then there are mean and evil folks called the Morlocks.In the Eloi race he meets the beautiful Weena (Yvette Mimieux).But could the time traveler ever live in Weena's time or does he return to his own? George Pal's movie The Time Machine is a very well done movie from H.G. Wells' classic novel, which was published 110 years ago, in 1895.This movie was made 45 years ago, in 1960.I read the book at the latter part of last decade and found it very fascinating.I have always loved the theory of timetravelling and wished it will be reality some day.I would love to explore the past and see the future.This movie still works this day, even though it looks a little aged.But it's the story, it's the story that matters.I borrowed the DVD from the library a week ago.There was an interesting extra in the DVD,Time Machine: The Journey Back (1993).Rod Taylor hosted it and they showed a play, where George (Taylor) and his best friend David Filby (Alan Young) meet each other after thirty years.Also Michael J.Fox said some heavy stuff about timetravelling.We all remember him from an other time travel classic, Back to the Future trilogy.Every time travel fan loves those movies and they should love also this one.Timetravelling may not be reality, yet, but in movies it has been that for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautful and Occasionally Thought-Provoking; Derservedly popular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film first when I was nineteen. At that time only a handful of adult sci-fi films had been released, almost all in the 1950s.This entry from George Pal was an important one, I suggest, following as it did on the heels of "War of the Worlds", "The Fountainhead" and "This Island Earth". The story device of time- travel was used often in the golden age of written sci-fi; only a few years after "World Without End", this H.G. Wells' tale was granted a sufficient budget to suggest possibilities no filmmaker had yet grasped. The cast also seemed to be a good one, headed by Rod Taylor as the Time Traveler, likable Alan Young as David, Sebastian Cabot, Tom Helmore, Whitner Bissell, Yvette Mimeux and Doris Lloyd as the housekeeper. And the film that resulted from the creators' efforts, despite some refused attempts at idea-level subtleties which would have been welcome, turned out to have classic scenes, strong emotional appeal and genuine humor and entertainment values. In addition, the dialogue by David Duncan was very intelligent, and other elements such as the sets by F. Keogh Wilson and Henry Grace, the art direction, the music by Russell Garcia and the costumes were very good indeed. The six scenes that I have always loved best in the film are the great explanation scene wherein George, the time traveler, attempts to explain his new theory of time and its permeability to travel to his three best friends; the use of a department store window and its mannequin's costumes to delineate passing years and changing social mores; the arrival of the time traveler among a group called the Eloi--by whom he is ignored; the discovery of the crumbling books in a great library when George realizes they've let everything of civilization fall to pieces; the battle with the Eloi's overlords, the Morlocks, in a vast underground cavern; and the scene where David pieces together the disappearance of the time sled--and three books George has taken with him when he returns to the future, also asking, "But which three books do ye suppose he took with him?" Rod Taylor is quite stalwart and intelligent as the scientist; and the others, especially Young and Cabot very capable indeed. Yvette Mimeuxas Weenais lovely and quite childlike, the Eloi girl George saves; and the climactic battle, the victory over the Eloi and the denouement and ending are quite satisfying. Overall, the ideas in the film could have been more explicitly handled. But apart from this cavil, we as viewers I assert have much for which to be grateful here. We have a fine and very enjoyable sci-fi film to set beside, "War of the Worlds", and ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea" and other achievements from the first concerted Age of cinematic science fiction. This is undoubtedly Pal's finest direction and his greatest production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did Wells know?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too bad IMDb doesn't have a separate category for reviewing the extras with the DVDs. The Time Machine has one of the best. It is almost a mini-sequel. It is so good that it is too bad they didn't go the extra mile and actually make a sequel. Of course, H.G. Wells didn't write one, but....The movie stands the test of time relatively well. And it is more faithful to the book than most movies these days. However, this is one book you really should actually read. That is not asking too much. The narrative, like the movie, is meant to be a story told over a long dinner, say two or three hours. That is about how long it takes to read the book, which is less than 70 pages long, as I recall. One might also watch Things to Come, another book by Wells. It is curious how well he anticipated the general trend of history. Specifically, he seems to have anticipated the long, drawn out stalemate of the Cold War, not to mention World War II. There seems to be an undercurrent of what might be called mysticism in many British writers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie; make sure you get the DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was fantastic for its day and age; but, you should make sure to get the DVD so you can see a feature concerning details of the production of the movie and the making of the machine. The feature includes a short film made in 1993 about this and is narrated by Mr. Taylor himself. Another short scene, using the original time machine from the film, was filmed in 1993 with Taylor and Young and is included within the feature. It shows a reunion of the two men after 33 years and also attempts to answer a plot question left over from the original movie. This special feature is at least as good as the original movie. The machine had quite a history after 1959 or 1960 (when post production was completed). Rod Taylor was not the "Russell Crowe" of the 1960s. Russell Crowe is a great actor but I still think of him as the "Rod Taylor" of the 21st Century. Taylor was a fine actor and why he did not make permanent superstar status is something of a mystery but considering the time in which he was a lead actor and the competition he faced; well, as the saying goes "they don't make them like him anymore". Much has been written about the variance between the film and the original work by H.G. Wells. However, as much a futurist as H.G. was, the fact remains that by 1960 we simply knew more about how the 20th century would develop than what H.G. did at the beginning of that century. So, the variances between book and movie were necessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film many years ago in England where we recently moved from (July 2004) and have probably seen it a dozen times now. The first time I saw it I also purchased a 'Talking Book' of 'The Time Machine' read by Robert Hardy ( of 'All Creatures Great and Small' fame )and his story telling of this film was so absorbing it made me want to watch the film again and again. There have, I think, been two re-makes of this film and I prefer the 1960 version with Rod Taylor and the lovely and simply beautiful Yvette Mimieux. ( wish I had met her!)I have always had a fascination with time travel and futuristic ideas. The film has a sweet inocense in relation to the two other re-makes I have seen, and like similar films of that era they hold a fascination which stimulates most like minded people it sends you into a frenzy of creative thought.....if time travel is a possibility? Is time travel a perspective of the time traveler only? if you travel into the future and meet up with people then return back in the hope of returning to that period of time in the future? ( much like when George, played by Rod Taylor, traveled back to the future to be with Weena, played by Yvette Mimieux ) at the end of the 1960 film, can you change the course of the future as well as the past? questions go on...Both actors played the role perfectly, Rod as a typical inventor, with passion in what he believes in and Yvette as an innocent ina time that hasn't come to pass yet.I enjoy this film and do not agree that it looses track ( regarding the previous comments ), it is the fascination that intrigues me and the simplicity of the film along with the effects of the time and the players. The music has a wanting air about it, sweet and sad and it applies itself to the film perfectly, musical scores and theme tunes are meant to stimulate the emotional in all of us, but it is no more so in people who relate to the subject of the film they are most interested in. Given the chance, and a hugely wild one at that, I would certainly travel in time, it would be an adventure that most of us would do, yet to be an observer rather than a manipulator, although it would be very difficult to hold back on issues that history has shown.In short I will watch the film again and again, simply because it gives me great, great pleasure, on of the best films of that era and proved to be a TIME proved movie.Thankyou to all involved.If anyone knows of either actors fan based websites please feel free to contact me as I am hoping to set up a site/business that has links/information on Science Fiction films and related fiction combined with past, present and future factual issues.If anyone wishes to contact me about this film and time travel issues please feel free to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE TIME MACHINE is based on the classic time travel novel written by H.G. Wells, and is much better than the 2002 remake. It's still very impressive for a 1960 film, and is easily one of the most exciting of the era. The story begins at a scientific meeting where a guest comes late, and is ragged, and full of cuts. It turns out that he has created a time machine, and is back from a trip hundreds of thousands of years into the future. He tells them the story of the future, which has the Morlocks, cannibalistic underground creatures that are the descendants of humans, and the Eloy, a peaceful quiet people that are cattle to the Morlocks. Soon, he falls in love with an Eloy girl, and must start their Revolution against the Morlocks.

Too bad the Morlocks didn't get them! And the poor Morlocks. If they were humans who went underground, what happened? Their skin turned green, their eyes glow and everyone has Phylis Diller hair!

		<shortDescription>if it ain't broke, don't fix it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first and far and away the best movie version of H.G. Wells' classic "science romance". Shot in 1960 for a reported $800,000 (tight even then!) it shows what can be done when one concentrates on story and characters rather than eye-candy FX. It won an Academy Award for make-up, and even though the film made extensive use of time-lapse photography as its principle effect, this relatively cheap effect wasn't allowed to become the film, unlike so many of today's top-heavy CGI extravaganzas. Well written, well acted, well directed, and with a haunting score by Russell Garcia, this film is a must-see and proof positive that They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore. Even though the Time Traveller doesn't go further into the future like he did in Wells' book, this in no way diminishes the film. George Pal was at the top of his game with this one - it needed to be remade like most of us need a secondnose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.G. Welles, Victorian Science fiction novel ' Time Machine' is in my humble opinion one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written, especially when reflecting on the idea of time travel and that it was written in the late period of the 19th Century. What makes the novel more exciting to me is knowing that it was written in 1895, years before the publication of Einstien's four dimensional space time phenomena. This makes me wonder how the public initially reacted to it, considering the chronology of these ideas. It would have to be a director's nightmare to create a movie adapted purely from a Novel while preserving as much of the contents as possible with approximately a couple of hours to display it's results. 'The Time machine' proved to be a great challenge and although it does not match the novel from head to toe, it would have to be one of the greatest attempts for any director and producer to deliver what I consider to be a great classic for it's time. Although this movie is dated 1960, to some fairness, one would really call it a late fifties classic. The filming, props and the technology brilliantly displays it all for this period of the end of the 1950's, beginning 1960. Rod Taylor is a great choice in performing inventor 'George' as he is docile, patient and determined to show to the world that he has invented a time machine which can take you backwards and forwards in time as far as you desire. He displays his prototype idea to his colleagues on new year's eve of the new century 1900. This is a science fiction movie that can attract more than most other science fiction ideas as it is based upon a simple idea of time travel, which must have crossed the curiosity of most of us, in one form or another (being another great dream for those that would like to either turn back the clock or those that wish to visit the future). This movie attempts to display this idea as best as possible. Once again, lets not forget that it is filmed in 1960 and for this particular era, I cannot see it with a critical eye. It then focuses on traveling to some 802000 years into the future where the world is a near like tropical paradise with primitive society consisting of the fragile and the cannibal Morlocks . The Morlocks from the original novel are represented differently which are more as ape like creatures. Yet the idea is trying to address the audience without losing the meaning of it's impact. My favourite scene was when the Morlocks chase to attack George while attempting to escape in his time machine. One of the Morlocks is trapped between past and future and is then transformed into a skeletal corpse while sitting on the edge of the machine. George returns from the future deluded and disappointed with what lies ahead. This was well directed and filmed, giving that extra touch to the movie. Time travel would certainly be able to make amends to any past that we prefer to eradicate and hence change history. We may even be able to relive times with those presently deceased and hence there would be no history as we could adjust it to our pleasing. It however says nothing about fate!!. This movie does not highlight these ideas, but keeps the excitement well intact. It is one of those few Science fiction movies which can be well accepted and appreciated, even if you are not into Science fiction. I would recommend it for the viewer to draw their own conclusions as I have enjoyed repeats with more interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched this again....and yes it's still as enchanting now as when I first saw it all those years ago!I remember seeing it when I was a boy, and being totally awe inspired by the concept of time travel.Since then I must have seen this movie 20 times or more, and it hasn't lost any of it's charm.Rod Taylor still shines as the victorian gent (though the movie is set in America as opposed to London, or so we're led to believe), and the entire storyline grabs you.My five year old daughter saw it for the first time the other day, and she loved the Morlocks, and she watched it constantly:another viewer hooked by the films charm.Sadly, the remake does nothing for this movie, though if you set the two apart, the remake is fairly good, but don't compare them together-in my mind the 2002 version isn't a remake at all but a new version of the original story by H.G.Wells.Anyway, in my mind a classic movie, one of my top 250 movies (if I could concievably make a list that is!), and one to be seen! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Memorable Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was first shown in 1960 and, for me, it completed a trio ofmemorable science fiction films - the first two being War of theWorlds and Forbidden Planet. In my opinion these films set thestandard for all future Sci-Fi films, and in truth few (if any) havecome close to matching them.The storyline is generally well known, as is the leading actor, RodTaylor who will always be remembered as "the time traveller'Scenes from the film also remain in the mind. Examples are the changing features of the tailors dummy in the shop window, the spinning 'talking rings' and the time travellers reaction to 'thecrumbling book' when he is shown the 'library'The 2002 sequel was always going to have a hard task living up to this original version - comparisons will always be made.This original will not disappoint anyone, whether they are seeing it for the first time, or like myself for perhaps the twenty first time !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During a 3-week trip in the States in 1998 me and my wife stopped for a coffeebreak in Sacramento. There i saw a sign that said: "science fiction museum". I was curious so i went in the little museum. The guy that probably was the owner of the museum showed me all kinds of props used in all kinds of science fiction films and series. One of the props was according to him "the original time machine" used in this classic from the sixties.The next christmas (1998) I saw the movie on television for the first time and since that time i always wondered if I really had a close encounter with the original time machine.So.... if you ever visit Sacramento check it out please ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in 2002, so got a bit confused about the 1966 scenes before I remembered the film was made in 1960! So I was in effect watching the future of the past from the present.But enough of that. I enjoyed the movie, and as others have pointed out before me it stayed pretty faithful to the book. There's a couple of changes that kind of rub me the wrong way though.**WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD**In the book our nameless hero went straight to a distant future, in the movie "George Wells" makes a couple of stops in the new century. During the first of these, in 1917, he finds his house boarded up and learns that it's been abandoned for years. So we know he's going to disappear, but since he's telling the story after he came back, we know from the beginning that he's going to embark on a second journey.Second (and this is the spoiler, in case you missed the warning above), in the book our hero just flees from the morlocks and leaves the world as it has become, in the movie he and the "peaceful" eloi help each other kill the morlocks (by the rather implausible device of throwing wood down the ventilation shafts to feed the fire they accidentally started - yeah right!) and live happily ever after in the restored utopia. And these are supposed to be the good guys. No matter how you look at it, this is still cold blooded murder (genocide even), and I for one would not want to live in a world where one half of the population has killed off the other half for whatever reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a well produced and entertaining film and, unlike Pal's attempt at HG Wells' other masterpiece "War of the Worlds", relatively accurate in its portrayal of the writer's story. The special effects are what's required, the story is (thankfully) initiated in Victorian London, Rod Taylor's acting is impeccable (although his accent wavers occasionally!) and the Eloi and Morlocks are well cast. Only one gripe - future England full of American cars? They can't even sell them here now!I have seen a trailer for the remake and it doesn't look like it'll hold a candle to this version. For a start, Guy Pearce has an American accent, the Eloi are dark skinned (they are pale and fair haired in the book) and the Morlocks can speak. Still, there's Pearce, and Irons, so it should (hopefully) keep us all awake for a couple of hours...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should not be missed. It should be viewed from the the perspective of romance, adventure and pre-Star Wars special effects. Although the movie does not always follow H.G. Well's story (Weena is killed in a fire); it is very entertaining. The workings of the Time Machine are left to the viewer's imagination, something that is sorely missing in today's science fiction movies. Rod Taylor gives an impressive performance as the Time Traveller.The talented supporting cast(Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot, etec) provide authentic atmosphere of the late 1800's.A remake of this movie would only trivialize this science fiction classic. The way we are "spoon-fed" by today's F/X and digital animation would make you wonder whether we are becoming like the Eloi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The novella was great, the film was fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 19th Century, H.G.Wells, Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson wrote science fiction that is still fantastic today. Virtually any film made from their works is remarkable regardless of the production values because their stories are so compelling and thought provoking. George Pal's version of "The Time Machine" follows H.G.Wells novella faithfully. The visuals help the story become more colorful and perhaps a little more fun. This works well at the beginning when the adventurer is discussing theory with his friends surrounded by hundreds of clocks ("Do you have the time?" one guest jokingly asks another), and futuristic scenes of London 1966. A dress shop mannequin brings us through the future via fashion (it's unrealistic to think the same mannequin would last 80 years--including the Blitz!--but it's a neat anchor to the 19th century.) Utopia is truly eden in the film which looks more like 1969 than the film's production date of 1960. Too bad the film keeps the bright and colorful look as George enters the underground world. In the novella this decent was much more frightening in an almost pitch black world where George's first sight of the Morlocks is their peering eyes in the darkness. The film shows too much of the Morlocks. Otherwise this is a great film which COULD be remade but with each dollar added to the budget it would lose the 19th Century sensibilities which most of this genre of films were able to capture during this time period (Journey to Center of the Earth, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, etc...). Nifty bits of trivia: Whit Bissell, who plays one of George Wells' guests, also played the part of Lt. Kirk in the TV show "The Time Tunnel," AND appeared in the 1978 TV remake of "The Time Machine." Alan Young (Wilbur Post of "Mr.Ed") uses a thick Scottish accent as the older Mr. Filby. Recognize it? That's an early glimpse of Young's animated character for Disney, Uncle Scrooge McDuck. I told you this film was fun. Also a P.S.: Check out "Time After Time" with Malcolm McDowell. It's the unofficial sequel (not quite remake) where George Wells takes the same time machine a hundred years into the future.</fullReview>

I am always fascinated by films that speculate on what life will be like in the future and how accurate the author or film makers were. Also, Rod Taylor was believable as the character of George and I think the scenes with him and Alan Young were some of the most heart warming in the whole move.Also, on some versions of the video cassette, there is a rather touching scene that Taylor and Young recreate their roles from the original film. During this epilogue George comes back to the past and meets up with Filby just before Filby heads off to fight in World War I where he would be killed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm probably somewhat closer to time traveling than most people who will read these comments (watch the bookstands, late '01).Look for the "fun" details in the movie -- like, HOW does Weena speak English? HOW would Morlocks who are little more than retarded grunting monsters with their minds focused on hankerings for Eloi a-la-carte -- HOW might THEY be SMART enough (or even be INTERESTED enough) to bother to drag a Time Machine inside of the White Sphinx?And HOW could Morlocks be INTELLIGENT enough (as Wells postures in his novel) to completely disassemble a Time Machine and put it back together again so that it WORKS?!And also, HOW can these primeval inept Morlocks keep all those underground clankety-clank machines running?The air-raid-sirens premise is complete hokey, and NOT of Wells' writing.Ever wonder about generalizing an ENTIRE WORLD HUMAN race and its ultimate Future outcome just by observing a VERY SMALL section of Futrozoic-Era London (of 802701 A.D.)?There're are a lot more of these little "goodies" to consider when you give deep thought to the verisimilitude (i.e., the "apparent reality" and whether it's plausible enough to be BELIEVED) of both the movie and the novel.A worthwhile 3-star movie.

		<shortDescription>Back To the Future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once one gets over the fact that a good deal of H.G. Wells' novel was scrapped, the movie of The Time Machine is a pretty good show. It tells the story of an idealistic young scientist who builds a machine that enables him to travel in time. Exactly how he came to make such a machine is left in the dark. Nor is it explained why he only travels forward.The movie is set at the end of the nineteenth century, from which it then moves forward several thousand years, and it's a handsomely designed production, in gorgeous color, with a nicely designed Victorian home for the inventor to live in, and a chariot-like machine for him to travel through time. Rod Taylor is excellent as the inventor, giving a warm, winning performance that gets the movie through some dull spots. Two relationships are highlighted; one with a male friend, in the present, and another with a woman, far in the future. Taylor's loyalty to each is touching, as one sense in him a man too idealistic to thrive in the modern world.George Pal produced and directed the movie, and handles the human and fantastic scenes equally well. Some of the best moments are early on, as we see the time traveler moving forward just a few days, as he observes day turn into night, a snail scuttling across the floor, and other mundane sights. Then he observes the mannequin of a woman in the shop window across the street, as her fashions change by the year. He gets a big jolt when the First World War arrives, and a bigger one when the next war comes along. His observations of modern history from the vantage point of a small house in London offer a fascinating and disturbing glimpse of just how violent man can be (as if we have to be told), and the distant future isn't any better. Yet George the time traveler remains undaunted, a true Victorian in the best sense of the term, he wants to fix everything, even the future. So persuasive is this movie that I'm inclined to believe that he could. A wonderful movie; provocative, often sad, at times frightening, full, in equal measure, of optimism and despair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE TIME MACHINE begins with scenes of lavish detail lovingly spent on hooking the viewer into the H.G. Welles story of a man experimenting with time. But unfortunately, it flounders once it delves into the futuristic sequences which never really come alive. The Morlock segments seem far too absurd to be convincing and that whole aspect of the film has a dated look. It also descends into comic book territory with the fight between Taylor and the gruesome looking Morlocks, all rather clumsily staged. But the film is most successful when it deals with 1899 and 1917 and the sets and costumes are most vividly realized in that section of the story.Ironically, for a film about space travel, THE TIME MACHINE has not dated that well. All of the Morlock scenes look like they were staged on the MGM back lot and have a very flat affect, in their staging and the robot-like performances of the inhabitants. It seems artificial and contrived for no other purpose than to assume a futuristic look without any real originality.However, the Victorian moments are well-staged and acted, especially the camaraderie between H.G. Welles (ROD TAYLOR) and his friend Philby (ALAN YOUNG). These scenes and the war scenes with bombs bursting and people rushing toward air raid shelters, are the best moments in the film. Production-wise, it's a handsomely mounted project.Based on the famous H.G. Welles novel, it does offer a fascinating look at something man has always dreamed about--and is still dear to the hearts of all those who find time travel a subject of endless fascination.ROD TAYLOR is excellent as the inventive Welles, but oddly enough it's ALAN YOUNG who has the most memorable role as Filby. It's he who walks off with the film's most memorable line at the closing, after the housekeeper asks him if the inventor George will ever return: "He has all the time in the world." Indeed, I thought Alan Young proved himself a very fine actor throughout, assuming the accent with ease and always making a charming companion. YVETTE MIMIEUX enacts most of her role with a very vacant, remote look that suits the part but limits her contribution to a merely decorative one. She was seen to much better advantage in other films of the '60s.Summing up: Fascinating but flawed concept still manages to hold the interest despite the artificiality of the futuristic scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well,there certainly were a lot of them,nasty green - skinned things with ratty hair and eyes like fairy lights.And their teeth.....scary to think that 800,000 years in the future there still won't be enough N.H.S. dentists to go round.Their eating habits were disgusting too,ask the Eloi - it was them they were eating. H.G. Wells is turned from a bookish Fabian - type socialist to a Rambo - style fighting man after one look at them.Didn't notice any lady Morlocks,perhaps that was part of their problem. At the dawn of the 20th century Mr Rod Taylor invents a Time Machine.Unlike Sam Beckett in "Quantum Leap" he can't go back in time and right wrongs (the reasons are fudged over half - heartedly)so he goes into the future with the words of his friends in The City and the military ringing in his ears - armed with the knowledge he could bring back, Britain could rule the waves for ever. He returns in 1917,for no good reason,and 1966 when a nuclear war settles his hash for more than half a million years. When the mountain that had apparently engulfed his machine has finally eroded he finds himself in idyllic surroundings along with a lot of blonde - haired young men and women in classical dress.No,there has not been a fourth Reich,,he has appeared amongst the Eloi,a placid people bred to be eaten by the aforementioned Morlocks. After saving the life of an oddly ungrateful lady Eloi they are all summoned by siren to the Morlock caves for supper.The Morlocks will be doing the supping - obviously. Mr Taylor discovers that these natural - born killers are afraid of fire and,in the country of the pyrophobic the man with a box of Vestas is King. Perhpas not surprisingly in the circumstances he sets fire to half the countryside and only just manages to crawl back to his machine,leaving Weena - his favourite Eloi(a lady,nothing strange about Mr Wells) - behind.Back in his own time his friends refuse to believe his story and - in a fit of anguish - he climbs back into the machine,sets the dial to a very long time in the future and disappears. Mlle Y.Mimieux blushes prettily as Weena in probably the best performance of the movie.Mr Taylor switches between English,Strine and American and hopes you won't notice.I will draw a veil over the performance of the actor who played his best friend who for some reason was given what he fondly imagined was a Scottish accent.Never mind,but sadly he was no better at playing his own son with an upper - class English accent.No,life's too short to explain - you had to be there.

		<shortDescription>I've just seen "The Time Machine" again for the first time in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and as a matter of fact, my memory has served me rather well; but in three respects it's played me false:(1) The Eloi were much less sexily dressed than I thought they were. You wouldn't believe the diaphanous, scanty summer dresses my memory had conjured up; bitter indeed was my disappointment when I saw what the women were REALLY wearing. Still, there's something about Yvette Mimieux ... at least, when she isn't called upon to speak ...(2) I hadn't remembered the musical score at all. It's by Russell Garcia (and you're unlikely to encounter any other score of his) and, as it turns out, it's not bad: sort of like Miklós Rózsa, although not enough to put it in the same league. The score contributes a lot to the sheer pleasantness of the fantasy, which is what carries us over the stretches that would otherwise make us cringe.(3) The Oscar-winning effects are shabbier than I remembered. It's not just age. There are many films of comparable or greater antiquity with more successful special effects: "King Kong" (1933), "A Matter of Life and Death" (1946), "Ben-Hur" (1959), "The Birds" (1963), "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968)... these were the first to leap to mind, but already I can think of others. Michael Powell, the director of the second of these films, said he distrusted special effects departments: HIS special effects were always subordinate to the art direction, and THAT'S why all the films I've named all look better than "The Time Machine". Many of George Pal's technical tricks have actually aged rather well. The time machine has a wonderfully enchanting design, and the scene where the model vanishes is carried off perfectly. But I don't get the sense that there's a single vision behind the effects (or art direction) as a whole, so many effects are at war with one another, or with the film as a whole. The lava looks phoney not so much because real lava isn't like that as because Pal didn't really know what he wanted it to look like.Another thing I couldn't help thinking: the story isn't really much of a story, either here or in the H.G. Wells novella. It's just a set-up. An inventor makes a discovery that will allow him to explore X; he explores X and then returns to tell us what it's like; then he goes off to explore X again and "he hasn't been seen since". Wells used this unadorned device throughout his career so many times one wonders how he got away with it. Often he DOES get away with it; it all depends on how interesting X is. And the vision of the future in "The Time Machine" - book AND film - is interesting, or at least charming, enough to make it worth putting up with the various imperfections.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Time Machine" was H.G. Wells' first published novel, but the last one to make it to the big screen. In it's day the movie was a big hit and won critical acclaim, along with garnering an Oscar for Special Effects. But watching today it's almost like viewing two different films in succession. The first part set in Victorian England with the novelist Wells discussing his futuristic adventure and setting up the premise for the concept of time as a fourth dimension was fascinating in it's own way. The idea of time travel and with it, the possibility of Man creating or controlling his destiny is a fertile topic of exploration and one which can be discussed and argued about endlessly. Moving through the near history of the next forty years from a starting point of 1900 as Wells does was effectively done conceptually with the changing fashions of the store window mannequin.But then he moved ahead eight hundred thousand years! Actually the year 802701 for those who want to be precise. It's at this point the movie began to take on the qualities of a mid Sixties Star Trek episode, at which point my focus turned from the serious to the not so serious. Granted, 1960 technology didn't offer anything close to what we have for special effects today, but the whole business with the Morlocks struck me as laughable. They were just too goofy looking as the antithesis of the Eloi, and when the story went in the direction of their being the dominant race and benefactors of the Eloi, it just didn't register with me.Not having read the source material, I'm virtually certain it holds up much better as a work of literature than it does as a film, particularly this 1960 treatment. I haven't seen the 2002 remake and seeing how it's rated considerably lower than this one I don't think I'll be making it a viewing priority. I guess what I'll have to do is put Wells' novel on my short list to read when the next opportunity arises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . otherwise known as THE TIME MACHINE (1960) features shaggy-haired cannibalistic cave-dwelling "Morlocks"--representing Humankind's "Id"--"farming" the less-developed eternally-picnicking passive vegetarian "Eloi" People, stand-ins for Man's "Super Ego." Visiting this dichotomy in the Year 802,701 A.D. is the third leg of Psychiatry inventor Sigmund Freud's stool, George (Rod Taylor), from the Age of the Ego, circa 1900. THE TIME MACHINE's "Science" would put Aristotle into a laughing jag, its "Biology" would set Darwin's head spinning, and its lack of linguistic evolution--coupled with the Eloi's implausible instant comprehension of the meaning of dozens of terms for concepts totally alien to their world view--is bound to leave today's viewers SHOCKED to see that this flick is a product of that "Cadillac of movie studios," MGM, rather than being a "B" movie from a House of Schlock, such as Hammer Productions. Need a time machine? Simply trot out Santa's sleigh, sans reindeer. Hiroshima too "tame" for cinema? Make nukes sprout volcanoes and instant lava flows in downtown London. Since MGM hadn't done a B&amp;W into color back into B&amp;W film for 21 years (since THE WIZARD OF OZ), I'm surprised they did not see fit to reprise that trick here. The "We welcome you to Eloi Land" ditty could have offset some of the nearly inexhaustible supply on display of Bad Science. But hey, this is a beloved classic, so perhaps it is more fitting to wonder about the three books with which George planned to make up for about 800,801 years of Eloi home schooling. Considering George's character as revealed in this flick, I would guess ROBINSON CRUSOE, THE ORIGINS OF SPECIES, and THE PEARL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Journey more fun than the Destination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie won an Oscar for its' effect/special effects, and no doubt for around 1960 that award was well merited. In brief the story is about a Victorian inventor who builds a time travel machine which takes him into the far future.The scenes in Victorian England and his actual journey and adventures in the time machine are excellent.However when he eventually concludes his trip he is in a place where the inhabitants are brain washed half wits who are being controlled by laughable monsters. Thus the film takes a sharp nose dive when his time travel journey reaches its' destination.I wish I could rate this picture more highly as I have seen it several times. But hey many consider the movie to be a classic and I agree that for the era it was made it is something special. But because of the major failing I have mentioned I can only give :6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually not as good as the 2002 remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen the 1960 version because I really liked the 2002 movie and had high hopes (originals are often better than remakes, of course). However, I was disappointed with the original. The acting is surprisingly not good, the pacing is inconsistent and surely those awful special effects would not have been very good even in 1960 (I have seen much better special effects in movies from the 50s!).However, what surprised me the most were the differences in the storyline. This movie comes across like a fun trip into the future, just to return ready for tea time (I reckon the main character in the 2002 version has a more compelling reason for time travel!). The poor acting (also of his dinner guests, let alone the people in the future) doesn't help either. The idea of finding a time without war is the only idea that somewhat redeems the main character's reasoning.The predictions of the future are obviously driven by the sentiment at the time, so I can't fault it for that, but this original version is full of obvious logical flaws, e.g. the English language being spoken well by everyone, so far into the future. When it came to the scene with the talking rings, I thought, wow, at last something visionary, maybe they're CDs of some kind, but no ... I won't spoil it, but suffice to say, the idea is technically ludicrous (and should have been even in 1960). Also, the lack of a ruler of the morlock makes it implausible that they build the machines, etc. just by themselves, as primitive and bumbling (and afraid of simple fire) as they seem.Some say this original version has more charm - I don't see it, I just see a stilted acting, a dumb, *very* stereotypical blonde as the love interest, and ridiculous looking morlocks.In summary, while above average *for its time* (hence the 6 stars), it is somewhat logically flawed. The storyline could be more compelling, the acting could be better, and the special effects are not good for 1960 (must have had no competition at the Oscars that year!). It's worthwhile watching for completeness, but certainly not as good as the 2002 remake in every aspect. Don't snobbily put a "classic" on a pedestal just because it's considered a "classic" (to some, just being old is enough for a movie to be called that).</fullReview>

Let's look at the good in them: All of their protein food is fully free-range, not in the narrow organic sense, but fully allowed to wander as they wish; well kept and raised in a safe environment; given a healthy diet that is natural to them; raised apparently without hormones and antibiotics; raised locally to minimize the carbon imprint of transportation; killed humanely; kept healthy and disease-free not by harmful inputs or artificial genetic modification, but by natural selection.Now lets look at the Eloi. They are given more to looks than brains; susceptible to a herd mentality (the same thing that got us Nazis and the Holocaust); predisposed to stick with a bad system because it's easier; anti-social; and chock full of bad haircuts (to be fair, so are the Morlochs).Finally let's look at H.

		<fullReview>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSThis is my ultimate classic! Watched this countless times when i was a boy! The air headed Eloi and there passive nature. The creepy Morlocks. I love the way when he uses the time machine everything around grows and dies, changes, warps and the mannequin in the window with her changing fashions, so clever. Incredible music score and direction. Rod Taylor is amazingly charismatic and dashing as the main protagonist. The lady (Yvette Mimeux) is so stunning. Original is so damn perfect and beautifully made its still good even today. Would recommend to any intellectual guys/ladies out there. Which three books would you take? At the time when this came out all the Religious people thought the bible would be one, don't be ridiculous! Laughable! That would have dire consequences, if it was me i know what id take. It would be a book that portrays the good of mankind and its morals and empathy, philosophy and Plato. Show emotion for all its good sides and glory, always do the best thing. The Eloi remind me of little children innocent and needing guidance. The young are so receptive and ideas flow through like water into the sea from a flowing river ending its journey. I think H.G wells hit the nail on the head with the Morlocks and a big stab at the industrial revolution and what mankind could become if we went the wrong way forward. An emotionless hungry race with ugly machinery void of morals(like a group of cannibals/animals), still i love how the two races are the same but one has been trapped underground while the other living on the surface, two different paths altering them entirely. The dusty books too totally disregarded by the Eloi the climactic, recorded singing rings telling the sad tale. Worth watching time and time again! This film had no need of a remake nothing could surpass this!Thought id paste the plot in too for a secondary look at this brilliant adaptation : Plot: After scoring popular hits with When Worlds Collide and The War of the Worlds, special-effects pioneer George Pal returned to the visionary fiction of H.G. Wells to produce and direct this science-fiction classic from 1960. Wells's imaginative tale of time travel was published in 1895 and the movie is set in approximately the same period with Rod Taylor as a scientist whose magnificent time machine allows him to leap backward and forward in the annals of history. His adventures take him far into the future, where a meek and ineffectual race known as the Eloi have been forced to hide from the brutally monstrous Morlocks. As Taylor tests his daring invention, Oscar-winning special effects show us what the scientist sees: a cavalcade of sights and sounds as he races through time at varying speeds, from lava flows of ancient earth to the rise and fall of a towering future metropolis.</fullReview>

There are plenty of subtleties and homage's for fans of the original to enjoy. I didn't even mind that they changed the location to turn of the century New York and took some liberties with their views of the future; after all I wasn't there to see Rod Taylor again. But this time machine goes nowhere! While I didn't miss the blond-haired, blue-eyed Eloi bimbos of the 1960 version, I did miss the 1960's Moorlocks and the lack of any tension and sense of wonder I experienced with the 1960 version. I was bored and didn't care about anyone in this future! Go if you want to play Venn , otherwise wait for the rental.

		<shortDescription>Rod Taylor had poor taste in women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First he becomes smitten with a dress store mannequin then falls in love with real-life mannequin, Yvette Mimieux. The first half of this picture borders on excellent...nice set-up to Taylor's adventure set against the backdrop of Victorian England. The scene where he initially eases his way forward in time aboard his nifty Jules Verne-like machine is fascinating and well paced. Attention here was paid both to character as well as the sci/fi meat and potatoes.Once Taylor reaches the year 8087889786 or whatever it was though, all bets were off. The film plummets into schlocky awfulness. The Morlocks are as bad as anything you find running around in an Irwin Allen TV production. Yvette Mimieux is, as mentioned, less animated than the mannequin in the store window. How did she ever get any kind roles after this? Bland and braindead doesn't even begin to describe her performance in this.All the science and philosophy discussed early on gets left behind and the film turns into a mindless and lame action film in a really drab setting. I never read Wells' book but surely it must have been based on a better concept than this when George rides off into the distant future. Rod Taylor, though, is quite good in the lead role. It's not a great piece of sci/fi after the first hour. What was an 8 out of 10 prospect gets 6 in the end. Too bad. I remembered it being fantastic when I was 11. But 28 years later it shows its cheesiness.I've yet to see the remake so I can't make comparisons. Here's hoping Time After Time with Malcolm MacDowell is still as good as it was the last time I saw it, 20+ years ago.</fullReview>

The characters are cardboard cutouts, the acting is wooden, the dialogue appallingly bad, the special effects pathetic-- the "nuclear attack" scene with the amateur lava flow is hilarious, as are the fright-wigged baby-blue Morlocks. And of course after 800,000 years everyone still speaks perfect English. I wish they had kept the scene where George finds himself a billion years in the future-- that's one of the most haunting scenes in the book.Another distraction was that the young Rod Taylor looks uncannily like Robin Williams. About the only thing that hadn't changed for me in the intervening 41 years is that I was still captivated by Yvette Mimieux, not as an actor, but as an incredibly beautiful young woman.I'd love to see TM remade with contemporary effects and strong casting and direction.</fullReview>

To take only one obvious absurdity, note that after 800,000 years of neglect books are in about the same shape as they would be after 80 years. Neither is it faithful to its source; in fact, it deviates sharply from, and is considerably inferior to, Wells' original (and very bleak) short novel. The one comment on point notes that the original was at heart a bitter attack on England's class structure.

		<fullReview>A loose adaptation of the HG Wells classic that's glaringly fifties in all the wrong ways. Weak special effects, atrocious acting and a few heavy-handed additions to the plot are just the tip of the iceberg. There's also a serious lack of science in this sci-fi endeavor; particularly bad is the scene where our narrator stops off in the middle of the Cold War, observes a tactical nuclear strike (literally annihilating buildings across the street) and strides through a few wisps of smoke back to the relative safety of his device. Rod Taylor is fine in the leading role, strong, smart and confident, but he's just about the only player worth his salt and the rest of the cast hams it up badly. And even he can't spin gold from straw with some of this dialog. It does have moments, and there's a weird allure to Taylor's relationship with a child-minded girl of the future (who smiles blankly as he rambles on, using words she clearly doesn't understand), but too often it goes the flashy route, especially in the big climax. There's a lot of depth and nuance in the novel, but you wouldn't know it from this take.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>just before you draw your terminal breath! Life's a piece of sh't, when you look at it...Stop! I must have gotten something wrong! How could one possibly come up with a stoic, nay, pessimistic mindset after having lived such a life as the Eloi in this film have? Such a life demands immortality! And that's of course what we think when we first see the Eloi, that humanity has finally made itself a Garden Eden, though our sense of bliss soon receives a first blow by the utterly inexplicable indifference with which the Eloi let their own kind drown.Soon we begin to understand that the Eloi are rather despicable. Nothing of that what they enjoy is the fruit of their own labour. They are spoiled, mindless children in the bodies of young adults. And they only live to be...Stop! At this point I must raise the question what all this is. Somekind of Marxist propaganda? Eloi = Bourgoisie? But why... why do the Morlocks live underground? If the Eloi could survive on the surface the Morlocks certainly could have done that too!The whole set-up is somehow wrong. The superior ones flee from the earth's surface, while the cattle is lured to believe that it lives in paradise? Who would ever treat his cattle like this? Who would ever treat himself like this, if he has an alternative? This is thoroughly weird! H.G.Wells was seriously concerned about modern people from the cities becoming more and more inapt. And he lived 100 years ago. "The Time Machine" speaks of Bourgoisie and Proletariat, but not as a struggle of classes, but as a struggle of cultures. This might seem absurd at first glance, but is it so wrong after all? Isn't it so that the ideals of journalists, professors, teachers, policemen, attorneys, judges, politicians and so forth have very little in common with the ideals of entrepreneurs, farmers, craftsmen and so forth? And this distinction fits the metaphor, those who take the risk and the responsibility are conceding wilfully the fruits of their work to those on the brighter side, who, in turn, see little reason to change a thing and deteriorate as human beings with every coming generation. Yet, while the first are conceding them, they do start to hate because of it, becoming more and more ugly."The Time Machine" dwells, I think, upon one single point. It is this. There are those who have a stronger desire to shape their environment than others have. Naturally the first class will enter inhospitable places more readily than the latter, if it is only given some liberty there. In the end an unreflected adherence to this instinctive dynamic will produce the Eloi and the Morlocks (or has already, now that I come to think about this not in thousands of years to come but in ten thousands of them already passed.)So, nothing is as weird as instincts. And "The Time Machine" does a superb job of touching you on the instinctive level. The plot is so archaic that it will make even the crudest viewer ponder his heart's desires.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoiler near end)The Time Machine ages better compared to other sci-fi films of the early 1960's, and seems to be more complete and nostalgic. Time-lapse photography is the essence of this film, as George (Rod Taylor) operates his amazing invention. The speedy oscillations of the sun and moon, or the changing seasons are well-done and effective techniques. Although the paradoxes of time travel are not discussed, the story's rich imagination propels the audience into examining the futures Wells has envisioned. The main focus of the film deals with the post-post apocalyptic races of Eloi and Morlocks. 800,000 years into the future is a lengthy bridge to cross. Evolutionary theories are supplied by the ?talking rings' (a very interesting theory about future technology that seems to echo in our current state). It would have been more effective to make the Morlocks closer to human form than what the film provides. The bumbling trolls are more comical than thrilling. Ironically, the Eloi are just as inept (despite indications of a ?superior race'). A haunting thought comes across well, as George is taken to the library and the books disintegrate at a mere touch. It would seem that he is not meant to understand the events that brought man to this point, but instead accept the Eden-like return to paradise. George actually fulfills this philosophy by returning back to Weena. Overall, George Pal presents the best adaptation, so far, of this infamous novel. Some really poignant, dramatic scenes add more depth to a (for lack of a less amusing word) straightforward story. When George runs into his best friend's grandson, his realization is captured as we also wonder about his untold future. In a slightly obsessed manner, he drags the machine into the yard for what might be his last voyage. Filby and the maid understand his reasons for leaving, and the doorway for more adventures is left wide open. Not timeless, but not shameful.**1/2 (of ****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Time Machine starts on New Years Eve 1899 as Victorian inventor H. Goergoe Wells (Rod Taylor) decides to try out the time machine that he has invented &amp; built, he travels through two World Wars &amp; ends up in 1966 as he &amp; his time machine becomes trapped under molten lava which hardens into solid rock. It takes centuries for the rock to erode &amp; for the time machine to become free once again, Wells finds himself in the year 802701 &amp; the world seems to have been reclaimed by nature as a peaceful tribe of people known as the Eloi live life carefree. However Wells finds that the Eloi are very primitive &amp; mutant creatures known as Morlocks control them &amp; use them as food whenever they need to, Wells is horrified by what has become of humanity &amp; teaches the Eloi to fight back against the cannibalistic Morlocks...Produced &amp; directed by George Pal this sci-fi fantasy adventure was based on a novel by H.G. Wells &amp; while many consider it an undisputed classic I wasn't all that impressed with it, sure it's a good film &amp; a fun watch but I wouldn't rate it as any sort of classic at all. The first half of the film is the better as Wells travels through time from the two World Wars to a rather silly looking 1966 which when viewed now in 2010 show's how far off the makers were &amp; another thing about that sequence set in London is the volcanic eruptions in the sense that there are no volcano's here in the UK &amp; why are all the cars seen American? Once the film reaches the far future the Eloi &amp; Morlocks are obviously a play on our own society with the Eloi the upper class with their nice clothes &amp; carefree life while the Morlocks representing the lower classes who live in squalor &amp; provide for the Eloi but also take in return. At 100 odd minutes it plods along with no real pace &amp; every time Wells stops it appears the world is at war, there's a definite anti-war message here but it does get a little tiresome the fourth time it's shoved in our faces. The character's are alright, the Eloi are rather dumb &amp; I can't believe they have never seen fire before, the Morlocks are more effective as monsters but don't make an appearance for over an hour while Wells himself seems a little judgemental &amp; dim witted considering he invented a time machine all by himself. As a Saturday afternoon family sci-fi adventure The Time Machine is a good watch &amp; it entertains but as the serious classic piece of sci-fi that many have called it I'm not so sure, good but not great.The actual time machine looks like a chair with a satellite dish on the back, while it's supposed to be faithful to Wells original idea I didn't think it looked that good. There's a few fairly impressive special effects scenes as time lapse photography show's flowers blossoming, the sun setting &amp; rising, buildings being built, rocks decaying &amp; the landscape changing in a matter of seconds. The Morlocks look pretty good but don't do much &amp; Wells almost single handedly beats them all up, overall the effect hold up very well. The production design varies with the Eloi always perfect looking with clean clothes, styled hair &amp; make-up despite living in a forest. I just didn't like the look of the film that much to be honest &amp; I wasn't convinced about the world it tries to paint.With a supposed budget of about $750,000 this looks OK but hasn't dated that well to be honest, filmed in Culver City in California. The acting is alright, Taylor isn't great &amp; Yvette Mimieux is pretty bad actually. Paul Schofield was Pal's first choice to play Wells but the part eventually went to Taylor.The Time Machine is a fun sci-fi adventure fantasy that's very much of it's time, it has a clunky political agenda &amp; it hasn't dated that well really. Remade as The Time Machine (2002) with slight alterations to the plot (more reason for Wells to make a time machine, no framing narrative) &amp; a much higher budget, to be fair I would probably rather watch the remake again than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of George Pal's work. Regardless of his actors' performances, there's a pleasing earnestness about When World's Collide, The War of the Worlds, and The Time Machine that breathes life into them.With that said, after watching The Time Machine for the first time in close to twenty years (and twenty-six years after seeing Time After Time with Malcolm MacDowell and Mary Steenburgen), I think you'll find that the Pal magic is about run out. Although it's a childlike and imaginative movie wherein the H.G. Wells character (here only known as George; remember Steenburgen in the 1979 sort-of remake cooing "Herbert" to MacDowell and making you want to change your name?) wants to escape the killing fields of Victorian-era Earth and constructs a time machine to go in search of something better (shades of George Taylor in Planet of the Apes). He travels to the future and, to quote Dr. Zaius from POTA, "He finds his destiny." The trouble with The Time Machine--if you watch too closely or are a hopelessly irritating movie critic like me--is that the technology of 2006 and the technology of 1960 are both ganging up on the story to defeat it. Unlike the dazzle of the aliens in War of the Worlds, you get stuck chuckling at the trick photography in TTM. The special effects and the message of George's trip must work together or George will really get lost in the fourth dimension.Oh, well. I'm thinking a 46 year old movie to death, here. I have a feeling that 10 year olds who aren't too terribly jaded by the modern world will find The Time Machine entertaining.Sometimes, that's all that really matters with a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best of the "Time Machine" lot, and one of the two best of George Pal's wonderful career. The movie bears the Pal stamp of affection for the characters and their dilemmas, and wonder with the mystery and magic of the world.Keeping in mind the budget for this film, Pal worked wonders. One can only imagine what he might have done with $100 million. No doubt we'd see the Traveller's journey into the Earth's distant future. But I imagine that H. G. Wells would have loved this film as is, and would agree that Pal's realization of his timeless story captures it's Victorian romanticism, spirit of adventure, progressiveness and caring for the timelessness of the bold and courageous human spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest Sci Fi Movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rod Taylor, Alan Young, and Yvette Mimieux star in George Pal's "The Time Machine", a great sci fi movie based on the novel by H.G. Wells.Taylor plays George an inventor in the late 18th century (1899 to be exact) who makes a machine that can go back in time.At first his colleagues are skeptical, but when they see George's small model machine that goes back in time, they start to believe him.George's best friend, and supporter is David played by Alan Young.George takes the machine back, because he is sick of the present time, with war being brought on.He travels to the early and middle 1900's and to his shock , George finds out that Man's future lies in war (which is pretty accurate even up to today's time).He sees how WWI and WWII started, and even sees when his house is destroyed by an enemy plane!George then travels far into the future, the year 802701, to see if mankind has any hope of living in peace.At first, he sees a great paradise with many people (mostly children) play about in solitude. But when one lady named Weena, starts to drown, he sees that no one seems to care. He rescues her, and after talking to the other youths, he learns that they learned nothing from their ancient ancestors.The books they have are old and buried.They have lived the good the life, based on the sacrifices from mankind, and they don't appreciate it (which is another accurate telling of today's times).He learns that Weena is part of the Eloi society which is under the slavery of the Morlocks, a cannibalistic race.The Morlocks give everything, food and clothing to the Eloi , in exchange for the slavery and their bodies as food.The movie was directed by sci fi whiz George Pal who won an impressive 7 oscars and awards for his movies.He is the Steven Spielberg when it comes to sci fi movies.What's astonishing about the film is the special effects that were made without computer help (which in most movies make the movie look more fake than real).The way the special effects people made flowers bloom, candles burn while the Time Machine went in time, is very special to see.It's a great site, from a special effects view, how these people managed to do these effects, with the limited resources they had.He directed "War of the Worlds" and "Destination Moon" which won numerous awards. DVD comes with a number of great features:A behind the scenes documentary with Rod Taylor. A great documentary where he shows how George Pal designed the machine. Taylor even shows us storyboards which haven't been seen in 30 yrs.Even the DVD main menu with Taylor on the cover and the Murlocks in the background, give the DVD a great sci fi look!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A favourite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film, and so does my dad, much better than the style over substance remake. In fact, both of us feel it is a huge favourite of ours and looking at the film's charms it isn't hard to see why. The special are still very charming and stylish- not dated to me, and the story is a haunting and speculative one that sticks to the spirit of HG Wells's marvellous story well. The set design is wonderful, the script like the story is imaginative, the pace is brisk and the direction is great. The acting while not the film's best asset is still good with Rod Taylor likable enough as the inventor. Overall, a big favourite and definitely worth a watch. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The year 802,701</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A loose adaption to H.G Wells novel. The first time I watched this film was at school because the book was part of our syllabus. On New Year's Eve, 1899, the Time Traveller calls over a group of his friends in London to demonstrate his new invention, a miniature version of a machine able to travel through time. The scientists are skeptical when the device dissappears, and the Time Traveller promises to bring them evidence that his invention really works. The Time Machine is a thing of glory, filled with crystalline bars, whirling dials, and a large, circular metallic backdrop, like a painted Orienatl gong. The sequence where our hero is first trying out the machine is probably the most effective part; slowly we see the world change, as the laboratory clock moves quickly forward, the candles melt, and the sun and moon traverse the sky in less than a minute of objective time. Soon the passing of days and nights are no more than flashes of light and dark. He stops briefly in 1914 and 1941 where he is disturbed to find the world at war. his third visit is 1966, nearly ends his journey; an atomic war breaks out, destroying London, and releasing a lava flow which swamps his machine; he manages to throw the knob forward just in time. By the time the lava hill erodes, and he can escape from his prison of stone, hundreds of centuries have passed; the year is 802,701, and a new order has arisen. On the surface of what used to b4e England live the Eloi, timid gentle folk who spend their lives in idle leisure, virtually unable to take care of themselves. Beneath the surface, in hallowed out caverns are the Morlocks, descendants of the factory workers, shaggy, white degenerates who flee from light and who raise the Eloi as cattle. Neither group has much appeal, but Weena, a human looking Eloi, in her own beautiful way; naturally, the Time Traveller takes up her cause. After fighting the local band of Morlocks and saving Weena from becoming just another meal, our Time Traveller returns to London to meet his fellow scientists with no proof of his story save one fragile flower blossom unknown to man; so gathering up a few books he runs back to his laboratory, a strange whirling sound is heard, and there where the time machine once stood are empty tracks in the snow. there is plenty of use of stop action/motion techniques in this film making time travel a reality but the atomic war in the sixtees ruins the credibility of the film for the contemporary viewer. Im looking forward to seeing the 2002 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>800,000 Years Is Longer than This Movie Seems to Realize</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many who were young when this film first appeared, I was captivated by it. Saw it two or three more times in the years between then and now. And now I've seen it once more and realize that I never want to see it again.I never again want to hear Yvette Mimieux ask the Time Traveler how the women of his time wore their hair.I never again want to be asked to believe that after 800,000 years people still speak and understand the English of 1899.I never again want to hear boring, mawkish old Filby mooning over the Time Traveler.I never again want to see Morlocks that look like stuffed animals with battery-powered eyes.I never again want to view Eloi who are unchanged after 800,000 years, looking like suburban teenagers.I never again want be told that the entire world of the future has been saved because of a fire in a hole in the ground set with an impromptu torch that seems to burn forever.The idea of time travel fires the imagination, yet the world that the Time Traveler encounters 800,000 years in the future is so unimaginatively rendered that it hardly seems worth the trip. In reality, modern man did not even exist 800,000 years ago. What fantastic changes could occur between now and 800,000 AD?It was a good film for its time, but enough already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first and undoubtedly the best adaptation of HG Wells' famous novel. George Pal's movie is a studied mix of poetry and cruelty (the Morlocks). Rod Taylor is very convincing in the role of the Time Explorer and restores perfectly his personality. Moreover, splendid sceneries, a shimmering photography and awesome special effects at the time contribute to the success of this movie. The only thing that the movie neglected is the significant pessimism in Wells' work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice movie with perspective for a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good movie, which kept me awake as I was trying to sleep, not because of the special effects, but mostly for the plot. Having seen the 2002 version and unfortunately comparing the two, it was nice to see an older (and only other color) version of a truly classic and compelling novel. The imagination that flows through one's mind as you watch overwhelms the poor special effects that were probably pretty good at the time. The WWII Air Raid effects were almost children book material, yet the morlock residential quarters weren't as bad. I loved the moments that were focused on George meeting Filbys dad. I wish that more elements besides England would have been featured, but no luck there. Recommend seeing it first, and then seeing the 2002 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Science fiction started out in trouble, had a golden period and now is in trouble again.This is from the starting period. As one of the inventors of the genre, Welles is to be blamed, I think.Its because he started the notion of taking a scientific principle, and extrapolating it into the future in order to make a political point. The point here of course is that without books, man can and irrepressibly will go wrong. The movie elaborates beyond the book, as each stop along the river of time touches war, clearly stupid war, before we encounter the effects of the great war. It is simply social commentary. There is no science in the description of the machine. There is a sort of science of evolution in the outcome we see in the future.But at the time, Darwin's theories were based on fittedness and constant improvement. This was later proved wrong, but Welles could not know. So the "evolution" that provides the basis of the future is bogus science.Its simple social commentary taken to an abstract locale. Unfortunately, the book in its time was reported to have bite; the class system ? especially in the cities ? surely was as layered as this. Contemporary readers would have gotten some value out of it. A hundred years later, all we can focus on is what's missing. 45 years ago, the effects were impressive, but for my money, it merely copies "White Zombie," and not as well.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly entertaining, but no classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never bored by "The Time Machine", and it certainly sticks closer to the source material than other adaptations of books. It also has a few interesting original ideas. However, seeing it today, viewers may wish (like I did) that the movie was somewhat tighter. The movie is never boring, but it sometimes goes offtrack, as when the hero stops a few times along his journey to the distant future.The explanation of why everything was the way it was in the future was a little too simplistic - as other posters have mentioned here, it's both different and watered down from the book. If they had concentrated the writing in this part of the movie, I think it would have been better.As for the special effects, though a few are still impressive today, there were some quite obvious matte paintings, models (such as the lava sequence), etc. These effects looked good in 1960, but today they can't help but look dated.See it, but don't set yourself up to thinking you'll see a classic. Keep your expectations lowered, and you'll be more satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Time Machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film made in 1960, there are some good ideas. Basically it is all about The Birds' Rod Taylor as George (H.G. Wells) and his latest invention. He has recently come back after a week away, and he tells his story to the mean that did not believe the invention he mentioned before he left. He told David Filby (Alan Young), Dr. Philip Hillyer (The Jungle Book's Sebastian Cabot), Anthony Bridewell (Tom Helmore) and Walter Kemp (Whit Bissell) that he had invented a time machine that can travel through time, and stay in the same place of all times. He travels from 1899 (the Millennium) to many times including the first and second world wars, both times seeing David's son, James Filby (also Young), and the far future with a volcano, and then he crashed. He was at least 70,000 years from his time, and it looks like a paradise with quiet and not thinking humans called Eloin, but they are ruled by the Morlocks. These Morlocks take some of the Eloin, and eat them! He does get back home to 1990 a few days later, but he goes back to 70,000 years later for the sweet Weena (Yvette Mimieux). I did see bits of the new one, I probably need to see it all to see if it is better, but this original is pretty good. It won the Oscar for Best Special Effects. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this right after reading the novel for the first time. Where Wells' writing is subtle, thought-provoking and imaginative, this film is ham-fisted and garish, making a caricature of the Eloi and Morlocks and stripping the story of suspense, analysis and excitement.I've never been more gripped by a novel. On one encounter with the Morlocks, deep underground, I was literally made to jump in my seat by the creepy, atmospheric description of their vile, soft touch and the hero's very real plight. As for the movie, well, it's just cartoonish. And as for inserting a love story... Please.Why do the Eloi speak English but not understand any of the words they speak? Why do the Morlocks have three fingers on each hand? Why is all the hero's careful exploration of this new world skipped in favour of goofish fight scenes? And so on. A ludicrous rendition of an amazing book.</fullReview>

It shouldn't have even been given the name "The Time Machine...by H.G. Wells". It simply took the basic idea of the novel, a few character interactions, but none of the real content.

The wanton and offensive addition of frivolous extra lines such as regard the date being Dec. 31, 1899 and that supposedly being the last day of some century (one can but speculate as to what sort of demented calendar the movie makers were using!) simply destroyed any and all credibility that the movie had accumulated.</fullReview>
