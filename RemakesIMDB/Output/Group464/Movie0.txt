		<shortDescription>How life must have changed for actor Alan Young during forty two years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE TIME MACHINE which I first saw at its London premiere in 1960 has long remained a personal favorite of mine. I bought the film 17 years ago and my own children grew up with it during the many times we have watched it since. It had a distinct charm and news of its impending remake was of no interest to me...another un-reworkable film if ever there was going to be one! I had no interest in its existence and even less inclination to see it. Dragged, protesting to the theater recently by my daughter who had already seen it and who, under the insane belief that I would enjoy it, strapped me into the seat! Raving incoherently and fully intending to dislike each and every frame, I watched what I expected to be my greatest nightmare since SPEED 2.Well girls and guys...I was so wrong! The remake not only captures and enhances the memory and feel of the original in many ways, it is vastly better! Pearce, who improves mightily as the film progresses (his early wimpy appearance telegraphed danger as far as I was concerned!) is just plain excellent as the slightly unhinged designer. The time machine itself (understandably, with today's fx potential) creams Rod Taylor's 1960 mini-umbrella! Mark Addy makes a great "Philby" very much in the style of Alan Young's original characterisation. Nice touch too, having him cameo here as the florist! For him of course, he has experienced his own "time machine" in the 42 intervening years!"One hit wonder" Samantha Mumba is an acting natural and as the Eloi girl, hits exactly the right note called for in the role. Both she and her younger brother Omero contribute greatly to the film's success. Everything about this film is visually impressive. Wonderfully imaginative sets and masterful cinematography. Jeremy Irons' small but significant role comes off well too!I read complaints about the Morlock make-up? Hello? any of you ever SEEN a Morlock? No??? well then, kindly refrain from negative comment. These guys looked and moved way better than the little furry 1960 creations! I liked also the intent NOT to have Pearce able to reverse the death of his fiancee - that was heightened awareness on someone's part!Add to the above a superb musical score and if this doesn't all make for an entertaining and thought provoking film, hey guys, you're hard to please. Certainly this was never intended for THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS set! It is inarguably the best remake I have ever seen and one of only a few have that ever managed to improve on the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>90 minutes of pure fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging from the initial reaction to THE TIME MACHINE, it seemed official to me that people have forgotten how to have a good time at the theaters these days. But the surprising box office performance in the week following its release seems to now suggest otherwise.This is a really fun movie. It's a tad slow at first, but since it's only a short 96 minutes, things get going pretty quick. Guy Pearce is well-cast as the slightly-nerdy mathmetician, Alexander Hartdegen, and the special effects were very well-done (some were shown unfinished in the trailer and in the TV spots, so don't let that deter you.) Two of the best sequences are the two forward-traveling sequences, the first when Pearce begins his journey into the future, with the change from Victorian era to the future flashing by before us during a terrific pull back from the time machine all the way out of Earth's orbit and around to the far side of the moon, where a ship is coming in for a landing on a colony. The second is when Alexander is knocked unconscious by an explosion tremor in the distant future, when explosives mining on the moon have knocked it from its orbit and have caused it to come apart, showering the Earth with moonrocks, and the time machine speeds forward into the very distant future. It's a terrific sequence in which we see the geological evolution of the area in a matter of moments, from cliffside rock formations taking shape to environmental changes and everything in between. A truely awe-inspiring moment that is one of ILM's finest effects sequences.I also liked how they kept a lot of elements from the original: good friend Mr. Philby, the spider making a web at the top of Alex's greenhouse, the constantly-changing store window mannequin that appears in the building across from Alex's house, the stop at one point in the future to discover that a disastrous incident is occuring (nuclear war in the original, the moonrock shower in this version), and the entrance to the Morlock's underground lair. Even the "talking rings" in the original are sort of brought back, though this time in the form of a holographic New York City public library computer (Orlando Jones), whom Alex first encounters in 2030 and again later in the film, set nearly 800,000 years later. The Eloi this time around are not all blonde and lifeless. In the original, they calmly walk into the Morlock's lair when the horns sound. Here, they run fearingfor the lives when the Morlocks come to hunt. And the Morlock's are no longer the lumbering bodybuilders with green body paint and white fright wigs. Here they are taller, more-muscular deadly creatures with an animal-like ferocity, with incredible physical abilities and capable of fast speeds.I think this movie is a good example of what remakes should be. Keeping the concept and elements of the original, while bringing to the material something new. Pearce, as I said, is well-cast as the time traveler, who builds the machine first out of his desire to right a tragedy in his past, then ends up traveling into the future. Samantha Mumba does a fine job in her first feature film role. I'm not too fond of singers who try to make the move to acting (witness the debacles of Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, and countless rappers), but Mumba was pretty good. I have a feeling we'll be seeing her more in the near future. Jeremy Irons' role was too brief, though. Being the Uber-Morlock, I was hoping for more screen time, as well as a lengthier confrontation. But he was still good. If I didn't know it was him, I never would have guessed it. Much to my surprise, his performance is a very restrained one, never exploding into one of those bursting, over-the-top speeches about wanting to overtake the planet. I was also expecting him to attempt to use the time machine to travel back to the past and take control in a time when there were more resources, but that idea (again, much to my surprise and delight) never even comes up. He seemed pretty content just doing things in the time he was in. Still, I would have liked for him to had more screen time.I was also very impressed with the score by newcomer Klaus Badelt, who has worked mostly in association with composer Hans Zimmer, providing "Additional Music" from films liked HANNIBAL and GLADIATOR. His score here is full of action and emotion, with a heroic main theme and a really nice African tribe-like sound for the Eloi. I look forward to the release of the soundtrack, and I'll be keeping a watch for his future projects. He sounds very promising.My only real complaint is that it all goes by too fast. A full two hours would have been great.In comparison between this one and the original film, I suppose some people would say it lacks the charm of the first. The original, despite some dated effects, is still a good movie, with the always-reliable Rod Taylor. I grew up with it on video, so I consider it a childhood favorite. But I also enjoyed this version for the fun-filled action-packed piece of entertainment that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOOD, ENTERTAINING FUN - but the 1960 Version is Still Tops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of the H.G. Wells classic is quite different from the wonderful 1960 movie starring Rod Taylor. As such, it remains entertaining but is rather more superficial. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it. This one is set in Manhattan instead of London, and the Wintry scenes of New York a century ago were nicely done. Instead of bemoaning the current dismal state of the world as in the 1960 version, our current hero, well-played by Guy Pearce, seeks to go back in time to prevent the untimely death of his beloved fiance. When he discovers this is impossible, he seeks resolution in the future. The special effects of course are good as he moves into that future, although the Geologic changes depicted could never have occurred in less than tens of millions of years.In the future, 800,000 from his present, following a calamity involving the destruction of much of the moon that nearly destroyed Earth (that in lieu of the nuclear holocaust in the 1960 version) he discovers the Eloi, now cliff-dwellers, who are indeed still there, although now instead of looking like blonde blue-eyed Aryans they are a nice Politically Correct cafe au lait color. Curiously, there seems to have been no change or improvement in this species despite those 800,000 years - evolution has apparently ceased. But that was how it was with the 1960 film; in fact, this type of Eloi is more intelligent and active-minded than the nearly brain-dulled zombies Rod Taylor discovered. They must have been more intelligent as they somehow got the steel handcuffs off our hero that had been placed there in the earlier scene in the past.This version is far kinder to the Eloi: our hero never feels rage at how they squandered the knowledge and history of civilization. Yes, books have crumbled, but there is a photonic human-like computer device, a remnant of the New York Public Library which contains every shred of information ever collected. How its power source remains up and running in a Stone Age world is never explained. "Self-contained power", perhaps?!The evil Morlocks are still around, and have evolved, but instead of menacingly appearing at night, or sounding sirens resulting in the Eloi marching catatonic and transfixed to their cannibalistic doom, the Morlocks now attack in broad daylight - and they are very muscular and athletic. In fact, we discover that those are just one type of Morlock - others include those who have emphasized their intellectual development instead of brawn, and Jeremy Irons does a great job as the spooky albino-like head Morlock, the "uber-Morlock". The scary hidden menace of night, in the Taylor version, in the world of the Eloi is missing from this film, unfortunately.Our hero's final battle was quite different from the other versions, and featured an altering of the future/present I still don't entirely understand. But it was compelling and dramatic.I missed the thoughtful tone of the 1960 film in which Taylor (as "George") discussed Time as a Fourth Dimension, and had a close relationship over the years with his friend Filby, and later his son. The scenes where he stopped his Time Machine inside his old boarded up house seventeen years into the future are, regretably, gone - too slow for today's audience, as perceived by the producers. It all created for me a nostalgic even elegiacal emotion I missed in this movie. The end scene where Taylor returned to bring back "three books" for his life with the Eloi is not in the 2002 film.The well-known symbolism in the Wells' book, and somewhat in the 1960 version, of an Upper Class feeding off the labor of the Working Class, cannot be seen at all in this current movie. That despite it being ably directed, at least in part, by his great-grandson, Simon Wells.The performances are generally quite good. Besides the wonderful Mr Irons, Guy Pearce is excellent as Alexander Hartdgen. Samantha Mumba is credible as the the replacement for Yvette Mimieux's Weena - now called Mara. Her actual younger brother plays her film sibling. Although she is an Irish singer, she is also half African, thus satisfying the PC need for the correct complexion. Mark Addy is limited by the script as Filby; in the 1960 version Alan Young was wonderful in that role.Scenery, sets, art direction, and special effects are all quite good.This film was entertaining and enjoyable. I just wish it had also been also as thought-provoking for me as the 1960 Rod Taylor version had been. I know comparisons can be invidious, but they can't be helped when remaking a classic. Nonetheless, worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We 4 hard critics actually liked this film! Great music, and more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The four of us are in the 40 - 50 age range, and we are fairly tough what we like and do not like in films. It was Friday night and we wanted entertainment. We read the comments below - mostly, but not all negative - and decided to take a gamble. Arriving at the cinema, we were prepared for a bad movie but hoping for 'a good relaxing time'. Well, we *did* like this film! Not a top box office smash or even an 8 out of 10, but entertaining nevertheless. The MUSIC was superb. ACTING was fine. HISTORIC life portrayed in old Cambridge Massachusetts was realistic - even the snow and cold weather was real. The ROMANCE was acceptable. The STORY, while not closely following H G Well, was good enough. The SPECIAL EFFECTS were very good indeed. It is worth a gamble, to see this film. But go with a light heart and an acceptable frame of mind, and keep your expectations below that of a 10 out of 10 film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Problems with my health have meant that for almost five years I wasn't able to read books properly. I used to love reading, but eventually I had to accept that it was something I'd have to leave behind, and I found instead a passion for film. Earlier this year my health improved enough to get back into reading, and The Time Machine by HG Wells was the first book I managed to get through. For that reason it's a special book for me, one that I'd recommend to everyone and defend against anyone who has a bad word to say about it. Beyond what it means to me, it's a masterpiece of science fiction from one of the genre's founding fathers. For those reasons, sitting through this adaptation was one of the most miserable experiences of my life. I can't begin to express the utter contempt I have for this piece of garbage.Set in nineteenth-century New York, in the days before accents had been standardised, this inane and inept adaptation takes Wells's genius and flushes it well and truly down the Hollywood bog. It sees Dr Alexander Hartdegen tormented by a pointless back-story, and driven to find a way of undoing the recent tragedy that only he cares about. He invents a time machine, powered by a dynamo attached to Wells's spinning corpse, but finds he is unable to change the terrible past. Helpfully mumbling exposition to himself, he comes to realise that the only way to understand why the past can't be changed is to travel 800,000 years into the future. It was at that point that Mr Logic ran out of the cinema, knowing he wouldn't be needed for the rest of the film. I wish I'd followed him.Arriving in our distant future, Hartdegen finds that the human race has evolved into two distinct species; the peaceful, beautiful Eloi and the evil, subterranean Morlocks, whose skin had long-ago turned into rather obvious latex. Lazily ? I mean, luckily ? the English language has survived 800,000 years mostly intact, and after a quick chat with one of the Eloi, Hartdegen turns action-hero as he tries to free her people from the clutches of the Morlocks.This is a thoroughly useless adaptation, one that leads me to believe that the screenwriter has never bothered to read the book, but had instead just glanced at the plot summary on its back cover, had a quick lobotomy, and set to work on his screenplay. Everything that made the novel so powerful has been lost. The anonymity of the time-traveller has been replaced by a dithering scientist with a name and a back-story; his parental affection for little Weena has been replaced with him wanting to do Mara; the Eloi's laziness and lack of intelligence has been replaced with a paradoxical inventive and resourceful nature, which throws up unanswered questions as to why they've failed to rebuild their society; the Morlocks, freed from the moral ambiguity that the novel had put forward, are reduced to nothing but supernatural, superhuman, hissable baddies. It was just horrifying to see a work of such genius simplified, dumbed-down and turned implausible, and lapped up by an audience of idiots, including my own brother! Adaptations don't have to be loyal, and I understand that there are certain things that work in a novel that wouldn't work on screen, but if things have to be added or removed, the changes should at least be equal to the ideas they replaced. That just isn't the case here.And it's so Hollywood that the pursuit of science isn't enough; Hartdegen can't invent a time machine simply out of the scientific curiosity, it has to be motivated instead by a lost love. And look at the difference between the book and the film, in terms of imagination and invention: The book created a machine that could travel through time; the movie has a holographic museum curator to dispense exposition. The book was a powerful critique on the British class system; the movie has a running joke about bowler hats.Even if you can see this as a film in itself rather than as an adaptation of another story, it still fails. It's ridden with plot-holes, crippled by the absence of logic, and has a pay-off that's so lazy it's a miracle it even bothered to turn up on time. And while we see travel in the fourth dimension, we only see characterisation in the first. The leads are allocated one adjective each, and accents that could be kindly described as `well-travelled'. The only real successes are the sweeping score by Klaus Badelt, and the often stunning effects by the always-reliable ILM and Digital Domain. Both were wasted in a movie that was heart-breakingly bad.I've never been so upset by a film. I've never spent so long with my head in my hands. I'm sorry they did this to you, Mr Wells.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Herbert George Wells(1866-1946)' "The Time Machine" happens to be one of my favorite novels I was interested in this film mainly to see how the old man's great-grandson would handle his legacy.This film left me with mixed feelings.Many good points and many bad ones.The Good:I truly enjoyed the 19th centurie scenes with Alexander and Emma.Her tragic death and Alexander's wish to change it provides our Time Traveler with serious motivation that he seemed to luck in the book.His obsession with his work is another good point.When you turn all your efforts towards one point then it is more probable that you will achieve your goals.The scenes while the machine is operating are visualy beautiful.Alexander as a "wandering fool" and his amazement at the 21st centurie achievements are well done.The Uber-Morlock was quite impressive, his seing the memories, dreams and nightmares of others seem to have left him with a lot of wisdom.His lack of emotions in a matter of survival for himself and his race is understandable.Why should he be shocked?Humanity has fed on flesh for milenia.We knowed and we don't get shocked by it.Why should he be?He actualy seems evolved rather than devolved as the other Morlocks.The Bad:In the original novel humanity supposedly reached a golden age.The upper-class used the lower-class to achiebe its dream.A life with no worries.The upper-class lived in magnificent towers while the lower class was forced to live below the earth, in tunnels.As time went on the upper-class evolved to the Eloi living in a paradise.Childlike in appearance and in nature.Their luck of problems left them with no need to studie and eventualy all the wisdom of their founders was lost.They were left using achievements they couldn't understand and couldn't maintaine.The lower-class evolved into the Morlocks.Forgotten by the Eloi they were left to feed on each other and eventualy reached the surface and started feeding on the Eloi.Both races were devolved when the Time Traveler arrived.The only person from this time he actualy likes was Weena a young Eloi girl he saved who grew attached to him.In the novel they wander around studying the state of decline the human races had reached.Unfortunately all this history of the two races is lost in this movie.The plot about the Moon falling was rather ridiculous and hardly explained the evolution of the two races.The Eloi of the film are much more inteligent than those in the movie but nothing interesting is truly done with them.I was hoping to see Alexander trying to teach his new roomates some of his wisdom.But nothing like this happens.Why would Alexander be interested in those two races isn't explained.Why would he pass two chances to return to his time isn't expained at all.What gives him the right to kill the Morlocks is left equaly unexplained.The "Happy" ending leaves him living in a time that shouldn't held any interest for a science-loving man.Nothing to explore or study.After his experience with time travel I don't think he would just be content left in one or the other point of the time stream.Rather unfortunate progress.It could have been a classic if only the finale didn't resemble stupid adventure movies rather than the original novel or any other piece of fiction with an actual interest in the concept of time traveling.Alas the Wells family seems to be devolving too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasting Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2002 version of "The Time Machine" is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects. What a lousy, uninspired bland story, with no imagination. Why so totally rewrite such a wonderful sci-fi classic? Are today's movie audiences too hip for the H.G. Wells writing largely as is? The 1960 George Pal version told a much more endearing story, even with clunky low-budget effects, beach-party looking Eloi, and Morlocks that looked like Smurfs on steroids.The 2002 version must have H.G Wells turning in his grave:1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci-fi cliché. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) that made the 1960 version so endearing. This sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie dour. If Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant either he or his buddy Einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma ? not have it dawn on him 800,000 yrs in the future ? from a Morlock no less, Doh!! What's wrong with time-traveling just for fun &amp; adventure &amp; curiosity -- as embodied in the 1960 version?2. Only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what Pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it. The George Pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of 'travel' though a 4th dimension.3. The director goes out of his way to make Pearce's character look geeky, a worn out old stereotype of scientists. In the 1960 version Rod Taylor was a little nerdy too (at least around Weena) but managed to be swashbuckling, playful and charming.4. Among the key themes of the 60's version -- abandoned in the remake -- is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Blowing up the Moon to destroy humanity is pointless -- and doesn't do much for science literacy. For over 4 billion years the Moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. Yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but this is just plain dumb and meaningless.5. Destroying the time machine is stupid too. Apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blowing up the machine to kill Morlocks is sort of a cop-out 'machina ex machina' Disappointingly, Pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends, a key part of the Wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back.6. Having Morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins H.G. Wells' wonderfully spooky, ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night. A true cinematic opportunity lost. Also, Wells depicted the Eloi as frail and childlike. These guys in the movie looked like they could take on Morlocks, if they weren't such big baby wusses.7. The one smart Morlock ? kind of a bleached-out Star Wars Evil Emperor -- had potential, but is so lame and aloof he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home ?! Boy, what a dramatic high point! In the book the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it, and fight to keep it.8. The goof ball hologram at the N.Y. Public Library is too much. It makes light of the idea of human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the "talking rings" that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind. Derailed evolution is serious stuff.Its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script. Save the cost of a ticket &amp; popcorn and go rent the DVD when it comes out (soon no doubt), at least you can fast-forward thought the dull parts, just like our time traveler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>passable update</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie version of `The Time Machine' is destined to suffer from the structural inadequacies contained in the original source material (H. G. Wells' 19th Century novel of the same name). The previous 1960 George Pal version could not overcome them and neither can this current update, written by John Logan and directed by Gore Verbinski and Simon Wells. Credit the filmmakers for resisting the modern temptation to transpose Wells' original tale to a contemporary setting. The story still begins in the 1800's, with scientist Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce replacing Rod Taylor in the role) creating a machine with the capability of transporting him back and forth in time. Unlike in the original film version, however, Hartdegen is not motivated by sheer scientific inquisitiveness alone. The writer has provided him with an added personal inspiration for his endeavors in the form of a beautiful young fiancé who is tragically murdered at the moment of their engagement. Hartdegen's overwhelming desire to find a way to return to the past as a way of rewriting the future provides the necessary motivation to get the story rolling. The structural problem alluded to in the opening paragraph boils down to the simple fact that `The Time Machine' is, by its very nature, a tale in which the first and second acts will always far outshine the third (although, regrettably, the third act always ends up taking the bulk of any adaptation's running time). The story is at its most intriguing and compelling in the setting up stage and in the scenes depicting the actual time traveling experience (this was the case in the first version and it is the case here as well). We watch in awe as Hartdegen races across the millennia, seeing life from a strangely sped-up perspective (the special effects here are very impressive). We also enjoy the little side forays he takes into the early 21st Century, where he visits a modernized New York City of 2030 and, a few years down the road, a world threatened by a disintegrating moon. Less compelling is Hartdegen's eventual destination, the world 800,000 years in the future. Those familiar with the earlier version will know all about the earth he ends up encountering, one in which the peace-loving, land dwelling Elois have become fodder for the cannibalistic, subterranean Morlocks, a grim product of evolutionary (or should we say, devolutionary) development. Just parenthetically, one is struck here by just how heavily Pierre Boulle `borrowed' from Wells when constructing his plot for `Planet of the Apes.' Given the obvious limitations of this rather hopeless final act, the makers of this version haven't done a bad job bringing it to the screen, since there really isn't much one can do with it but to turn the whole thing into an extended chase scene anyway. The odd passivity of the Elois in acquiescing to their decreed nutritional fate was, however, captured to greater effectiveness in the 1960 version. One felt caught off balance by the sight of all those people resigning themselves to the inevitable while affording no sympathy for the `loved ones' who were the Morlock's victims. As partial compensation for missing this intriguing aspect, the new film does make the Morlocks appear rather more threatening than they did in the Pal version. However, Jeremy Irons, as the representative of the `intelligentsia' branch of the Morlock race comes in way too late in the story to register effectively, and the climax of the film is both confusing and inexplicable to put it politely. (There is, however, a nice coda at the very end, merging both time periods into a shared spatial dimension). The least believable aspect of this current edition is the fact that the few Elois who still speak English 800,000 years in the future ? an absurd notion in its own right ? could give Professor Henry Higgins a run for his money in the elocution department. We should all possess their pitch-perfect pronunciation, command of diction and level of vocabulary.Guy Pearce isn't given much opportunity to act in this role and I must say that, in his beardless state at least, his gaunt countenance is almost frightening to gaze upon at times. I don't know what might have happened to him in the year or so since he appeared in `Memento,' but someone needs to buy that poor boy a substantial meal from time to time. In some of the early scenes in the film, in particular, he looks positively freakish. I kept looking for signs of deliberate tampering by the makeup artists and wondered how some future alteration in his appearance might play a significant role in the narrative's development. It never happened, which leads me to wonder if Pearce might not himself be morphing into a Morlock.Special mention must me made of the superb art direction that adorns the film. The sets depicting 19th Century New York City are particularly impressive.Overall, `The Time Machine' does a better job revisiting its source material than Tim Burton's `Planet of the Apes' did last year. That may, indeed, be faint praise ? but praise nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed The Time Machine and its focus on simplicity and special effect instead of heavy time travel contradictions and fancy plots. This movie was straight backwards and forwards dealing with materialism and love - straight and simple. This was a feel good movie in a time (our time) of confusion, fear, and war. Too many critics looked for something really deep, tried to tear it apart because of its apparent lack of scientific continuity. But really the essence of this movie was human relationships and I thought the movie it made its point even though it took 800,000 years to do it. I felt with the characters. The only real problem I had was how a language could be kept so pure after so many years - of course they may have had help from a local library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was interested in seeing this remake simply to find out if it was as bad as a myriad of critics have suggested it to be . I did love the 1960 version and I am not keen on people remaking my favourite movies , but surely last year`s remake of HG Wells romantic fantasy wasn`t going to be as bad as painted was it ?Herbert George Wells wrote the source novel so why not call the hero Herbert or George ? It`s also a Victorian sounding name so why`s the hero got a name that resembles Steve Martin`s character in THE MAN WITH TWO BRAINS ? This screenplay just like David Duncan`s from the 1960 version lacks an opening hook but it does speculate that even if time travel did exist it would be impossible to change ones destiny , an interesting thought . ScreenwriterJohn Logan adds a post modernist sequence featuring both HG Wells and STAR TREK . I didn`t think the humour worked very well but I had to admire his cheek , and since everyone cycles everywhere Logan suggests that in the mid 21st century America has elected a president from the green party which no doubt caused civilisation to collapse . Like most other movies set in the far flung future there are illogical gaps in the screenplay . For example remnants of the present day would still exist . Put it like this : The pyramids of Egypt are a few thousand years old and at the present rate of degeneration they won`t exist in a few thousand years but Alexander goes 798,000 years into the future and the skeletal remains of 21st century New York still remain ! , but as I said this is a common flaw in time travel stories as is the ridiculous notion that hundreds of thousands of years into the future people will still be able to understand and speak English , so this can be forgiven on the grounds of dramatic license . My only real criticism of the screenplay is that John Logan borrows a bit too much from Duncan`s earlier screenplay , otherwise this is a fairly good adaptation on Wells groundbreaking novel . Adding the ubermorlock is an inspired idea that works very wellI`m in two minds who to credit / criticise as director . As you may know Simon Wells left the project days before the project was completed and was replaced by Gore Verbinski so for the purposes of this review I`ll refer to the director simply as " The director " , and the director does manage one show stopping moment as the camera pans out from Alexander at the end of the 19th century across an ever evolving landscape eventually stopping on a lunar colony . The most controversial aspect of the film seems to be the casting or more especially the casting of dark skinned actors as the eloi , but I fail to see what the problem is . The eloi live on the surface in bright sunlight so why shouldn`t they be dark skinned ? It`s also in keeping with the social darwinism of Wells novel . The eloi have evolved due to environment the same way as the ubermorlock has evolved , and social darwinism is totally amoral so there`s no right or wrong , or good and bad involved . I do wish people would stop playing the race card . As for the ordinary morlocks they`re superbly designed with some great make up involved but the director throws a massive spanner in the works by having them running a hundred miles an hour and being able to jump great heights which suddenly makes them unconvincing which is a great pity , they would have worked better as men dressed up rather than CGI supermen . I did like Jeremy Irons as the scene stealing ubermorlock though . A word of warning for those of you who suffer from photo sensitivity , sadly once again this is a movie that heavily features strobe lighting . I`m not epileptic which is just as well because I wouldn`t want to risk a seizure watching THE TIME MACHINE . Sadly there seems to be more and more films being produced with this technique in style used and sadly I`ve had to keep saying - Stop using strobe lighting in movies . It`s totally irresponsible for directors to do this .To sum up the 2002 remake of THE TIME MACHINE was light years away from the debacle I`d been led to expect . It`s fairly good in its own right but not as good as George Pal`s 1960 version , maybe because it lacks the charm of the former , a charm that movie had in abundance , but this version is still pretty good as remakes go</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just recently seen this movie and enjoyed it very much. I had seen the older one a few years back in school and have read the book at least twice. The modernization of the past movie and book makes this movie very enjoyable, especially if you have seen the old version and/or read the book. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. The movie and other versions of it, I feel, should all be seen. This is because I found it very intriguing seeing the advancement from how the world was when H.G. Wells wrote the novel to the movie that was made years later. The movie made in 2002 enhances H.G. Wells version and the version in 1960. When H.G. Wells wrote the novel he didn't know anything about space travel and computers. Incorporating these ideas in the newer version makes the movie spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different from the earlier version, some of it good, some not, but overall not a bad movie at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1960 version will always have a special appeal, especially to those of us who remember the 1960s, because we had not yet been bombarded by such time travel films as "Back to the Future" and others. I recall seeing it the first time with a great aura of fascination. Although based on the book, the 2002 version does not try to follow it too closely.SPOILERS - In the current film the professor's incentive for perfecting the time machine resulted from his girlfriend's (Sienna Guillory) untimely death at the gun of a petty thief, 4 years later he was determined to travel back and change the circumstances to save her, and marry her. But when he does, she dies in a different manner. Instead of going back and trying again (shades of Groundhog Day) he quickly figures out that one is not able to travel back and change history, but he doesn't know why. So the rest of the film is his travel forward in search of that answer. Not sure why, because knowing the answer may not change anything. Seems to me it would have been better to travel back 6 months or so, marry his girlfriend immediately, the travel back, say, 5 months everytime that fateful day approached so in theory they could live together forever that way! But I wasn't the director. HG Wells' great grandson was.More SPOILERS - So, he travels forward. In 2037 he finds that a nuclear explosion on the moon went too far and it was breaking up and falling to Earth. An accident in his time machine knocked him out, he inadvertently went forward 800,000 years, found the moon event had resulted in two races, those above ground, and the underground Morlocks, who used the Eloi for food. There, in a conversation with the Uber Morlock, who knew everything about the professor, he learned why he couldn't change history to be with his girl. The only reason he invented the time machine was because his girl was killed, so if that event were changed then there never would have been a reason for a time machine, so he could never have traveled back to reverse her death - a paradox that he could not ever overcome.The changes in the story are fine, however the overall film could have been executed much better. In particular, the Morlocks evolved into some vicious creatures that didn't make a lot of sense, and their CGI movements were not realistic at all, and the quality not consistent with the rest of the film. Still, I found it a worthwhile 90 minutes of entertainment. The DVD is fine, there are several interesting extras.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the oppportunity to see "The Time Machine" last night at a special screening in Arlington, Virginia, and I enjoyed it. It does not follow the same plot line as the H.G. Wells book, but in my opinion, that does not detract from the movie. I thought the Orlando Jones character of Vox was quite interesting and amusing, and Jeremy Irons definitely deserved more screentime, as he is a superb actor in every role he takes on. The character development was a little weak, but it was tricky with the time travel aspect. I found the special effects to be good; it is difficult to measure up to some of the special effects that have come out recently, and I think they did a good job. With every new movie that comes out, you have increasingly more spectacular visual effects, especially with the higher budget films. All in all, I think that the actors did a good job, and the movie kept me interested the whole time and was especially good in some parts. I would definitely recommend this movie, and I give it 8 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.G. Wells is spinning. No doubt about it.Really, this would have been a decent sci-fi/adventure movie, if it hadn't been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson. I kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel. What resulted was a pathetic and simpleminded bastardization.The novel is a great sci-fi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it (probably because they read it when they're very young) is that it's overflowing with social commentary. The Eloi and Morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of Victorian England, and the overall message of the film is that EVERYTHING DECAYS AND DEGENERATES, a satiric jab at Victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever. There's no love story, no romance with a beautiful Eloi woman....in the novel, the Eloi are 3-foot-tall childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal. The Time Traveler does befriend an Eloi woman but it's clear he thinks of her more like a pet, and anyway she's killed before the novel ends.This movie first tries to give us a totally stupid backstory as to "why he wants to travel through time." The treacly romance and the Lessons He Must Learn are enough to make film fans vomit.The journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster. OK, not bad, but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally degenerates, as in the book. More a reflection of the times, I guess, as the George Pal version had a nuclear war take place.The general story? Ugh. A total misrepresentation of the novel. The Eloi are too competent and warlike. The Morlocks are too intelligent. The UberMorlock is an embarrassment, and there's no setup. He just shows up in time to be killed. Yawn.Samantha Mumba does OK. Guy Pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain. (Reportedly he broke a rib while filming this.) He also looks unhealthy and overly thin, as if he had been ill for a long time before making this.A sad, sorry film version of one of the world's classics. H. G. Wells deserves better....MUCH better.</fullReview>

It's a listless, plodding, mumble of a film that gets so bogged down in special effects that it never comes close to capturing the adventurous spirit of the classic H.G. Wells story.

		<fullReview>After reading the novel which is about a one hour read, watching this film became a sad disappointing experience. Just as he did in prince of Egypt simon wells somehow managed to direct a script that took away all the drama and mystery out of its source material and turned it into this homogenized nonsense. Now I'm a sucker for cheese and camp but this movie made absolutely no sense. There was no joy in any of the performances or any humor. There were no thrills and that silly bookend with addy's character of filby throwing his hat in the air was the last hackwriting straw. I felt very violated when this movie was over and I still refuse to believe it was only 90 minutes it went on forever. I wondered how the studio and director could have OK'd such a lousy script but then my friend pitched the movie to me exactly as It was and I said wow that sounds great but what happened to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do I like this movie so much?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just don't get it, I really don't.There's all kinds of things wrong with this movie. The plot is fairly nonsensical, the story is disjointed, the early scenes are dragged out interminably before anything really interesting happens, a lot of the dialogue is cheesy and inane, and the the Morlocks look like they were designed by a senile makeup artist left over from the original series of Lost In Space.So why the hell did I love it so much? Let's break it down.1) The special effects are very very good. The time travel sequences are worth the price of admission alone, especially during the lengthy journey from the early 21st century to the year 800,000. It's a shame Guy Pearce was unconscious for most of the trip, because he really would have enjoyed the scenery.2) The music is also excellent, especially the haunting Eloi theme that plays through much of the second half. George Lucas must be kicking himself that he didn't hire the same composer to do the Ewok music in Return of the Jedi, although even that wouldn't have saved the unbearably stupid concept of a race of stone age teddy bears who can defeat a crack army of armoured, gun-toting soldiers by hitting them with sticks and rocks. But I digress.3) The re-invention of the Eloi as a tribe of noble primitives was a good move, since a race of futuristic Aryans in togas would have A) been terribly dated and corny, and B)ensured the arrival of James T Kirk in search of an easy lay.By the way, I really want to live in that "cliff village" of theirs, even if rolling out of bed in the middle of the night would be instantly fatal.4) Samantha Mumba is a babe, plain and simple. Not only that, but she also provides one of the better performances in the movie. I've read some damning comments about the acting ability of the divine Miss Mumba, which I don't really understand. Presumably it's because her subtle, thoughtful, and believable performance is such a stark contrast to the shameless overacting of Guy Pearce, Jeremy Irons and Orlando Jones. All three are brilliant actors, to be sure, but they don't half ham it up in this flick.Well, alright, Irons hams it up in EVERY flick.As a side note, casting Mumba's real-life sibling Omero as her character's younger brother was a stroke of genius. Not only does it make their relationship believable, but the boy's a better actor than many people twice as old and five times as famous as him. And his hairdo is frickin' awesome.All in all, what should have been a really bad movie turned out to be one of the most entertaining flicks I've watched in a long time. And not just because of Samantha Mumba in skimpy clothing, although that obviously didn't hurt matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No time like the present...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess that I march to a different drummer when it comes to this film. I enjoyed it for the most part, and find it very clever in many aspects. The major drawback comes from the plot - it is far too simplistic for the elaborate care that went into both the visual aspect of the film as well as the nice touches at almost every turn.The plot is rather simple - Alexander Hartdegen, a mechanical physics professor in turn-of-the-century New York (turn of the nineteenth-into-the-twentieth century, that is), has his head in his equations, apart from one thing, his love for Emma. When she is killed in a botched mugging (yes, New York at that time even had muggings in Central Park), Hartdegen drops everything to invent the time machine he'd theorised, in order to prevent Emma's death. He soon makes the discovery that it isn't possible to undo the past (at least not that aspect of the past), but becomes obsessed with finding the reason why. He speculates this is more likely to be answered in the future than in the past or present, and thus goes forward in time. He makes a few stops along the way before arriving at a far-distant future (nearly a million years in the future), in which the human race has evolved into two distinct species - one on the surface, and one below the earth.So far, so good - departure from H.G. Wells' original classic (a great piece of literature) and from the earlier film, but not beyond the pale. The effects here are truly stunning in many respects - the time machine itself is a marvel (the DVD has a feature on the making of the machine), and the time transformation scenes are very inspiring, up to and including the zoom-away shot from the machine into the air all the way to the city on the moon. The Eloi city along the river is also a remarkable scene. The movie rightly won awards, including the Academy Award, for these effects. Unfortunately, effects do not a movie make. This is where the plot failure comes into play.Hartdegen seems to give up far too early in trying to change the past, and his relationships (such as we get to see them) in the future are very stilted. Jeremy Irons (himself an Academy Award winner) has precious little screen time, to deliver what is perhaps the most anticlimactic resolutions I've seen in a long time. The overarching question should be 'why?', but seems to transformed into 'what if?' in an unclear way (the deleted introductory scene, available on the DVD, helps to more firmly establish the question, but, alas, it was deleted). Hartdegen remains in the future (like Wells' and the earlier film's scientists, albeit in a different way), perhaps to help transform the future, but we'll never know (a sequel is not likely).Despite the thin plot, what I found most enjoyable (apart from the special effects) were the clever touches here and there, far too numerous to mention. When Hartdegen arrives in 2030 (prompted by an advertisement proclaiming 'the future is now'), he encounters a user-friendly library computer (personified by Orlando Bloom) with a real sense of humour and humanity. When Hartdegen asks about time travel, the library computer even incorporates Star Trek gestures and sound effects into its discussion (as well as the yet-unwritten musical version of 'The Time Machine', by Andrew Lloyd Weber). One woman in the distant future speaks English (now called the stone language, for the stone engravings that remain from store fronts and the like), but speaks without accent (strange enough, but even stranger that New Yorker Hartdegen sounds more British, as does the Morlock leader Jeremy Irons).Indeed, there are so many little pieces here is seems that the writers spent more time trying to incorporate bits of cleverness throughout the script than making sure the script as a whole had thorough soundness.Another piece I really liked was the music. The sombre brass tones, the triumphant orchestral arrangements, the folk/modern synthesis for the Eloi, and the dramatic scoring really enhanced this film beyond measure. The DVD has bits of the score that replay on a loop sequence during menu screens, and I've sometimes left these on to hear the pieces over and over again.The DVD has one of the better menu sequence set-ups I've seen, simulating the machine effects in visuals and sound, as well as incorporating score elements and special effects. DVD extras include the delete scene, commentaries by many of the crew, several pieces on the special effects (including one on the time machine itself), This is a fairly good film, despite its flaws. Overall I would award it three-and-a-half stars, but will round up to four in honour of the effects, the music, and clever pieces.</fullReview>

They are targeted at people who don't care enough to read the actual book but still wouldn't mind to "touch the timeless classics", provided they are made into something as easily consumable as a movie. However, while the relation between the movies like "The Musketeer" and the books behind them is pronounced well enough to justify referring to these movies as rather humorous parodies, "The Time Machine"'s connection to H.G. Wells novel is virtually non-existent. The movie does contain some minor references to the book, but they don't really stand out among apparent references to "Planet of the Apes", 7-Up commercials and other sources.In the end, it is a rather typical B movie with relatively modern special effects, which used Wells name to con itself into the mainstream.

		<shortDescription>One of the only worthy remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes have been attempted many times in the attempt to capitalize off an idea twice. Most of them fail miserably, and those that do the job decently often do not offer any more than improved effects. Not so here.H.G. Wells' story has had some liberties taken with it in this version. Again, most who attempt to stand on the shoulders of a great writer (The wretched Planet of the Apes remake comes to mind) stumble futilely. In this case, there is a deeper message than the original story. The latter part of the movie drags a little bit before getting to that crux, but it's worth it. As a product of the times, H.G. Wells apparently sought out to write a story colorfully in order to voice his grievances against the inevitable idiocies of war. That message seems to still be an important one, but this movie goes beyond that and says something about the human spirit, and a thought-provoking perspective that makes fate, not just war, an inevitable result of the limitations of our own consciousness.There are also things which are done better in the original of course. This version gives the future a little bit too much hope, and strays further from the original story than the 1960 version did. However, that is just Hollywood's typical smudge...the story is still poignant. The soundtrack is also very good.One thing it could do without are a few line gimmicks like referencing Einstein just to illustrate the time traveler's intelligence...but again, this is minute enough a detail that it is simply amusing and just shows the script was written dumbed down a little throughout, which is typical.This remake is an exception because it adds something good to the original, making them very similar, yet very different, such that both movies are compliments of each other. The only other that I've seen do this is The Parent Trap (in my opinion anyhoo).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just about everything is dopey in this update of the imaginative George Pal film of the 60's: there's a lame, pandering romance that immediately slows the film's pacing from the get go; there's ridiculously groovy touches like Orlando Jones as an annoying computer database with personality, and a future urban view where everybody's riding bicycles; there's Morlock puppetry not up to the standards of the decades-old, Jim Henson stuff in THE DARK CRYSTAL; and there's a finale that looks about as tacked on as they come (probably because the director had a nervous collapse before he finished the picture). I'll also mention the annoying and fashionably obligatory inclusion of a child performer for good measure. Needless to say, this TIME MACHINE is strictly for those with nothing better to do after eating out at one of many franchise food joints. Another lamentable Hollywood attempt to make money off a good idea that's already been done well (in this case, WELLES) enough)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor H.G. Wells.. he must be wearing grooves in his grave from all the spinning by now.About the only thing this film (yet another attempt at an updated remake of George Pal's timeless 1960 feature) has in common with his novel of the same name is tht there's a time machine in it, the destination year of 802,701, a race of people called Eloi, another called Morlocks, and hmm.. can't think of anything else!Pal's film is one of my favorites, and as such, this new one was a gross disappointment to me, except for some very good effects sequences - the time travel and Moon shots.. in fact with a nice sharp pair of scissors, I think I could edit this film down to about ten worthwhile minutes out of over two hours of padding and dreck.Wells' entire premise for his protagonist's time travel adventures is summarily thrown in the dumpster, in favor of turning his driving motivation into a love story. Fine, make another movie out of that, but it's not Wells' vision.** SPOILERS AHEAD **In Pal's 1960 classic, Rod Taylor as Wells, the time traveller, was always VERY careful to lock his machine, or remove its stick shift before leaving it.. here we have Guy Pearce getting out of his machine in 2030, and wandering through the NY Public Library for who knows how long, leaving his machine in an alley way for anyone to stumble on and mess with.The device used to destroy humanity as we know it in the new film _was_ a stunning idea, but still, it stretches the imagination to think that a 20 megaton bomb could split the Moon apart..Flash forward 800,000 years and the Eloi this time around are a dark skinned race of shaved head, tattooed jungle people whose most beautiful inhabitant is a Janet Jackson lookalike. Throw in a child actor for no good reason at all.And someone really has to explain to me how crumbled remains of New York could survive erosion, winds, the sands of time, and glaciers for 8000 centuries, while we watch rivers carve out entire valleys, and mountains of rock blow away as so much dust.. if that isn't enough of a stretch, explain to me how a holographic library docent could survive for 800,000 years. Who was oiling his gears all that time? What was the power source that lasted that long?Even in the beautiful time-travel effects sequences, nothing much makes sense.. as the scale of time keeps changing depending, apparently, on what the director wants you to dwell on.. if you're going into the future at such a rapid speed that you can see mountains erode in seconds, you are _not_ going to see individual trees spring up in a meadow.Okay, so forget all that. Chalk it up to Hollywood not expecting its audience to ask such questions. But why pollute Wells' classic story with new elements cut out of whole cloth and inserted for reasons we can only guess at? There was no "Uber Morlock" in the book or the original film.And riddle me this - how did Pearce know what effect throwing his pocket watch into the gears of his time machine would have? Did he build a bunch of them and figure out ways he could make them explode back in 1900 first? The effects shot of him and Samba or Mumbo or whatever her name is, jumping out of the blast field is nearly a direct ripoff of Arnold jumping out of the Predator's blast field at the end of that fine film.. Watch the bad guys get vaporized while the hero and his playmate barely escape.. sigh.. how many times have we seen this schtick?Some films are simply classics that do NOT need to be remade, and 1960's The Time Machine was one of them. Or if you're going to remake it, at least be honest to the original, like the 1980s remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers was.Otherwise, please, don't waste our time.Read the book and see the 1960 film if you really want to know what The Time Machine was about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could this movie have sucked more?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, first off, Guy Pearce is a wonderful actor. The brilliance he brings to Memento is enough. He can be in a million crappy movies and still be considered great.Now, whoever "wrote" this piece of crap does NOT deserve such honours. Did you actually READ the book? Can you read at all? What did you do, skim the Cliffs Notes for this book, then glance at the 1960 movie and think : "What a neat idea"?I don't know what is wrong with Hollywood. H.G. Wells writes a brilliant novel, which is still enjoyed by people over 100 years later. Let me say that again in case you missed it: ONE HUNDRED YEARS! The story is obviously just fine the way it is, otherwise it would've been forgotten long ago. Have you ever heard of market research?Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe if you apply the Hollywood cookie cutter to everything you see then you'll make more money than if you use, oh I don't know, artistic ability. But then again, why do you think Peter Jackson's the Lord of the Rings movies have done so well? He didn't just put the title on some standard story line. No. He read the book (I'll wager he read it SEVERAL times). Then he set about using his talents to create a brilliant visual interpretation of the printed page. And he made millions. Maybe you can too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I Had A Time Machine, I would go back 3 hours and stop myself from wasting my time and money on this very lame remake. This film has no heart or soul like the earlier version with Rod Taylor. It just limps along hoping to dazzel us with special effects. The so called directors of this film seem to be interested in effects rather than story telling. The male lead who was quite good in the Count of Monte Cristo as the villian, has absolutely no screen charm or charisma. A fact that I would attribute to poor directing. The earlier film version gave us something to think about, just as the book did. I also want to express my annoyance with how American movie studios feel the need to always make the storys' take place in the USA. In this version the setting is late nineteenth century New York City, as opposed to late nineteenth century London as in the book and earlier film. There is a lot of world out there beyond the U.S. borders it's time the Hollywood crowd woke up to that fact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was one of the many fools who were sapped out into paying for this at the theater, even though I payed 4 bucks for matinée (before 6pm) prices.The remake's story was ho-hum, the CGI Morlocks were lame, the Eloi were rastafarian to mimic today's fads (no I did not think the chick was hot at all), the re-killing of the hero's modern girlfriend was somewhat cruel, overall just a sad, bad remake. I'll take Rod Taylor, Weena, and the fat glowing eyed surfer Morlocks over this junk any time. My estimation is that many of the reviewers who like this awful remake are young kids, which does not account for either good taste or a true value of the old classics which are largely unappreciated by today's confused and ever-wanting-more youth. When the 60s version came out (I first saw it in the 70s for summer fun) it was pretty damn impressive and still holds up. You don't have to have an over abundance of CGI in a movie for it to be better. Too much of this looks fake. I can't say enough of how disappointingly bad the Morlocks looked and they ran and jumped around like they were in a child's video game. 3 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie successfully portrays H.G. Wells novel (with a few modern updates to what the vision of the future will be... highly effective). I like this story, having seen the original adaptation, this version was greatly needed. I think this film had what was needed to accurately project Wells' story: technology. Only with a sprinkling of CGI could this story be depicted visually. And it was done quite well. All the way down to the overall appearance of the time machine, itself. One obviously needs to have the ability to think for one's self in order to follow the depth of this epic.What worked: Obviously, the much needed technological advances in movie graphic arts. Though, this film didn't over use this graphics technology; it was very tasteful and powerful. Also, the acting talent was well-selected; esp. Guy Pierce. He just has the perfect amount of madness in his looks for the part (while maintaining a certain attractiveness, allowing the audience to be able to relate to him). This was a stunning visual achievement.What didn't work: The portrayal of the Eloi could have used some improvement. Maybe the film could have gone into more of an explanation as to the motivation of the peoples, going to that particular area and most assuredly into the clutches of the hunters. Still, this might only bother those who read the book... it really didn't detract that much from the enjoyment.8/10 - could have been a little better; though, it was quite good.thank you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have read the book, this movie is true to just about .. 0 aspects of the book. The only similarities between this movie and the book are that the future humanoids are called Eloi and Morloks, and there is a time machine. That's where it ends.If you are watching this movie hoping for a faithful representation of the book on the big screen you will definitely be disappointed. I have not seen the 1960s version, but I have no doubt that it could not possibly be worse than this piece of garbage.**May Contain Spoilers after this**It is easier to count the number of things that it has in common with the book than the number of discrepancies. Here are some things that I was completely ticked off about: 1) The whole love-affair, driving him to go back into the past - It never happened.2) He never went to the mid 2000's in the book. That was just made-up for the movie.3) The Eloi can speak English. (WTF??) 4) The Eloi live on these odd structures that jut from the sides of cliffs overlooking a river. The book described them as living in marble palaces, in a lush, green, lightly hilly area.5) There is no Sphinx-like structure.6) There is no green palace. Instead, he re-discovers the museum he saw in the mid-2000s, and all of the electronics are miraculously still working fine after 800,000 some-odd years.7) Instead of coming to his own conclusions about the societal structure of the future-world, the computer guy from the museum simply explains it all.8) There is no Weena.9) The Eloi and the Morloks are dark-skinned, not pale-skinned like they are in the book.10) The time traveller's impression of the Eloi as being fairly stupid is never evident. They are in fact portrayed as just a tribal people.The list goes on. There are only a couple of things that actually come close to representing the true story as laid down by H.G. Wells.If you have read the book, I strongly urge you not to watch this garbage. And if you have not read the book, and you have seen or will soon see this movie, please - read the book. If H.G. Wells were alive today, he would never have let this absolute piece of garbage be published.</fullReview>

Starring Guy Pearce, Mark Addy, Samantha Mumba and Phyllida Law, what unfolds is a weak attempt at philosophical sci-fi that is pumped full of CGI to appease the undemanding Multiplex hoards. As grieving time traveller Alexander Hartdegen (Pearce) propels forward 800,000 years for his date with the apocalyptic future, where a two tier class system involving the weak willed Eloi and the animalistic Morlocks is the order of the time, we the viewers are treated to cheap action movie conventions and a laughably bad extended cameo by Jeremy Irons.H.G.

		<fullReview>Surely this movie was a joke. It simply must have been a spoof. For anyone who is unwisely considering this movie instead of the book or at the very least the Rod Taylor film...all I can say is please reconsider. If however you have already read the book, seen the Rod Taylor movie and are assuming this might be a worthy way to spend a few hours, all I can say is that your sock drawer needs tidying and your refrigerator could do with sorting...anything rather than this soiling your eye-balls with this rubbish.********Potential Spoiler (if it's possible to spoil this dross) *********I won't bore you with a blow-by-blow account of every failed detail...instead let's simply cut to the last act of this film and say it left my mouth hanging open. Both the Eloi and the Morlocks are totally misrepresented in a shambling travesty that completely undermines the conclusion of the story. Firstly the Eloi in the novel are supposed to be a child-like, naive race that kind of resemble human cattle, superficially living in a paradise but actually reverted back to an almost brain-dead state of obliviousness. But that's not quite the oppressed 'noble savage' bullsh*t we get in this film, making their wicker village in the trees and speaking perfect English, ending up like a cross between a sh*t Endor and that bloody atoll in Waterworld. With the Morlocks however, the only problem was the way they look, act, sound, move......oh to hell with it, everything is wrong with them!!!! They look like a cross between the trolls in Fraggle Rock and that annoying naked brown lump called 'Station' from Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey. Savage and terrifying?? Only if you are a 5 year old bed-wetter who hides behind the sofa watching Scooby-doo. Instead we get these boggle-eyed muppets jumping out of the ground like a budget remake of Michael Jackson's Thriller. Sweet Jesus!! Oh and as the cherry on that cake we finally have a bleached Jeremy Irons desperately trying to pretend he's doing Shakespeare or something......rather than p*ssing his career down the same drain that Dungeons and Dragons offered him. Jezzer - in future, just say no.Avoid this film like the plague unless (like me) you enjoy classic Hollywood mistakes.</fullReview>

This movie was so disjointed and had so many story ideas running through it that you had to have a road map to find your way around.

		<shortDescription>An almost perfectly bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS. I know that mostly everyone has forgotten this spiritless and pointless failure of a movie that was obviously intended to leave bad impression of H.G. Wells with everyone who never actually read his books. However, I just have to highlight even more stupidities and inconsistencies that this flick is essentially made of. Hopefully, I will not re-hash too much of what so many other reviewers already mentioned. Just to be fair, I want to bring up the only TWO positive points of this movie - the actual Time Machine prop that actually resembled the original concept (as far as its description goes in the original text) and made a solid steam-punkish impression of the Edwardian-era futuristic technology AND the Sienna Guillory's appearance. Despite of not being allowed to do much, she does a great job playing a romantic, cute but serious lady who just keeps popping up in all the wrong places at the worst possible time. Now, to the not-yet-mentioned-flops as I perceive them. 1) Why this movie is called "THE Time Machine"? Does it imply that this is THE most definitive, most all-encompassing story that beats the original book without even following 99% of the author's story line? 2) We are lead to believe that Alexander's short chat with the steam-powered vehicle driver allows him to learn the way to build a better steam power source. So, upon being called to do so, Alexander builds his totally self-sufficient time-traveling apparatus that evidently uses the power of steam (recall all the steam pressure gauges that machine proudly displays) to provide sufficient energy for a limitless number of time jumps in all possible directions. I mean, since no actual time machine exists yet, it is pointless to argue what it can be powered by or how much of what kind of power is necessary, etc. Although the Back to The Future's time machine that required a carefully balanced mix of high speed motion and influx of great number of Gigawatts of electricity made a more convincing (though somewhat humorous) impression of a time-traveling apparatus. In the H.G. Wells's original novel there was no specific mentioning of the power source employed by the time machine. One just knew that it was not horse-powered and the power source was actually self-contained. 3) What made the script writers think that back in the late 19th century NYC a public place filled with respectable public would be favored by armed robbers? Come on! There was more than enough social segregation in existence during those days that made it practically impossible for a low-life lower class armed robber to even appear in the midst of respectable and well-to-do public. I can hardly imagine anyone insane and lucky enough to be willing or able to carry out a time-stretched armed robbery resulting in shooting a robbery victim to death. Keep in mind that a large caliber revolving pistol produces TONS of noise and police used to patrol such public places ON FOOT (not locked up in cars staring at computer terminal screens like they do it today) at a distance of being able to hear a police whistle produced by a nearby patrol (cops had no portable radios then). 4) Now, the idea of the Moon falling apart from some nuclear mining operation is ridiculous (although beautifully depicted) considering what our next-door space neighbor went through already with them giant meteorite impacts and stuff. 5) WHY the Eloi were turned into some sort of a mixed African/South American tribe living in hanging flower pots is waaay beyond my understanding. No one can possibly believe that such obviously physically capable and inventive group of people would fail to defend itself from some ape-like primitively armed and armorless Morlocks. Obviously, the directors wanted to include some strong but oppressed people of color to the movie, but did not know how and why to do it. 6) Why was the Uber-Morlock character added to the movie? What "insight" did he provide? If he was such incredibly powerful mind-controller, then why did he resort to a primitive knife fighting and chocking? That was just ridiculous. 7) What happened to the planet in the far-far away future? We just see a bunch of the Morlock-built scary structures all over the place. Which means that they did not eat all the Eloi at once after all or they got scared of messing with Eloi and started eating one another instead? 8) What made Alexander abandon time travel without clearly learning the reasons why the past cannot be changed? Being a true scientist, would he just drop all his research like this? If one is to speculate about this topic of changing the past, the assuming that the past that already happened cannot be changed, then traveling "into" in would be impossible in the first place. Or an attempt to change the past would result in a "fork" in the time line thus creating an "alternate" reality. But the movie does not bother to bring up any of these theories. 9) What made it possible for the NYPL to nicely survive all the disasters, land changes, ice ages and who knows what else that presumable took place in 800,000-odd years? Even the shelves storing PAPER BOOKS were left practically intact. The books themselves stayed there unmoved! Why? The library was not hidden deep underground and filled with inert gas or something! There would have been absolutely no trace of any library left whatsoever. ?And so on and so forth. In short, you should really just read the book first and foremost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is difficult to remake an old film that was popular in its day, difficult that is if you aim for some other purpose than making money. The acting quality in this one is well below the original, made about 40 years earlier, with Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux. The story is basically the same; the viewer gets to see some CGI and other effects that the original lacked, but that doesn't make for a good remake. Simply up-dating the special effects is not enough. Much like "The Day the Earth Stood Still", this remake was a great disappointment. There are rumors that Forbidden Planet will be remade. Let's hope the producers do a better job than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having never read the book and only having seen the 1970's version of this story for comparison I really enjoyed this film. The set decorations were well done and the film for the most part seamlessly blended physical sets with the GGI locations. The actors all did a fine job. I fail to understand why so many dislike this film.The story, while familiar to many, was still suspenseful and moved at a good pace. It's not an action film and so those expecting non-stop action may be disappointed. Still there is action and great special effects. Time travel is such an interesting concept and is something that most people have day dreamed about at one time or another. I'm sure there are things we all wish we could go back and change. The Morlock's are great and terrifying enemies.Of course there are some nitpicks to be had. Will people still be speaking English 800,000 years from now? Unlikely! Could a computer still be running and functioning 800,000 years from now? I can't imagine how!!! Finally, given the way the geography changed over 800,000 years, which was well visualized by CGI effects, is it likely that the Time Machine would not emerge buried underground or underwater? I didn't find it at all credible that the Time Machine, which does not move physically but only through time, would materialize on the surface after so many millennia.Still, this movie tells a good story and IMO is well worth watching. It may be a little scary for children under ten but in general is a good family film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i've read the time machine and have taken in the original movie which i enjoyed on both counts. I was bored one day and checked out the remake on a cable channel - with no expectations. I seem to recall this was advertised as a sci fi action adventure but what i got was certainly not that. it was more. i was first impressed with the way the movie looked...grand, sweeping and beautiful. It starred Guy Pearce who i like very much. It had a different story, in which his fiancé is shot dead in central park as they celebrate their engagement .. this drives him on more to build the time machine. however he cannot change the past - and sets off into the future to find out why...i liked this change of direction. We see how we destroy our world with technology. We see how Guy's character finds love again millions of years into the future destroying his machine at the end. We see as he holds hands at the end with his new love standing in the same area his house used to be - millions of years ago, his friend and housekeeper discuss his disappearance and hope he's happy. The idea that different times are happening all the time. 10/10 and an extra mention to Samantha mumba and her brother - they were both excellent in this movie. I think this movie will gain more followers as it gets older.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Tock--Not Enough Tick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When DreamWorks Pictures and Warner Brothers teamed up to film H.G. Wells' pioneer pulp science fiction yarn "The Time Machine," they made it a family affair and hired the author's great-grandson Simon Wells to helm their $70-million plus movie. Previously, Wells directed two animated features: "Balto" (1995) and "The Prince of Egypt" (1998), so "The Time Machine" challenged him as his first attempt at a live-action outing. Not surprisingly, Simon says in his introduction to Ace Paperbacks' new edition of his great-grandfather's venerable novel, "The film we set out to make is not a verbatim recapitulation of the book. We did not intend it to be. I do not feel it is the duty of filmmakers to simply put books on film. That would seem to undermine both media." Apparently, something undermined Wells because 18 days before shooting wrapped, he succumbed to extreme exhaustion, and Gore Verbinski of "The Mexican" replaced him. Yes, "The Time Machine" surpasses the dreadful "Mexican." In fact, the new "Time Machine" depicts its subject matter with far greater verisimilitude than its Oscar winning forerunner. The lengthy, snail-like end credits reveal that scenarist John ("Gladiator," "Any Given Sunday," and "Bats") Logan drew on David Duncan's script from the original 1960 M-G-M epic, directed by George Pal, starring Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux, Alan Young, and Sebastian Cole. Indeed, Pal's version rather than the Victorian 1895 novel (serialized in 1894) inspired Wells and Logan.Nevertheless, Wells &amp; Logan wrought several changes that not only differentiate their mediocre remake from Wells' original text, but also from its juvenile cinematic predecessor. Indeed, the slickly done remake sets its sights much higher than the original movie but ascends to pretentious pinnacles without achieving a cathartic effect. Sadly, the 2002 version of "The Time Machine" qualifies as strictly second-hand hokum. Loyal Wells' readers may bristle at the liberties that the filmmakers have taken with the source material. First, they shift the story setting from London to New York City. I suspect they did so because an episode similar to the shoot-out in Central Park would never have occurred in England. Second, they give the protagonist of the novel a rather geeky name: Alexander Hartdegen. In the original, the hero was Herbert Wells. Third, they saddle him with a fiancée. In the novel, the hero lived as a bachelor with little interest in the opposite sex. After all, he pays matronly Mrs. Watchett to clean and cook for his intellectual pals and himself. Neither its opulently hallucinogenic computer-generated special effects nor its realistic looking 19th century production values can redeem this murky, moribund melodrama about the moral consequences of time travel. According to "The Time Machine," you cannot alter antiquity.In 1899, an eccentric Columbia University Professor, Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pierce of "Memento"), plans to wed his sweetheart Emma (Jessica Lange lookalike Sienna Guillory of "Love Actually"). After Alex gives Emma a ring, an armed assailant robs them. Alex tangles with him. During the fracas, the thief wounds Emma accidentally, and she dies in Alex's arms. Four years elapse as Alex toils in his laboratory to create a time machine so he can go back and save poor Emma. Although he prevents Emma's tragic murder, Alex fails to save her when a runaway carriage collides with her and kills her. Tastefully handled as this sequence and the previous one were, the effect borders on hilarity. Grief-stricken, Alex wants to learn if mankind can reverse the past. He hurtles his time machine and himself into the distant future. Civilization has atrophied into two primitive societies: the peaceful, cliff-dwelling Eloi that appear straight out of director Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes" remake. When a beautiful, deeply-tanned Eloi dame Mara (Samantha Mumba of "Johnny Was") saves Alex, he falls for her and helps her people oppose the aggressive Morlocks.Altogether, "The Time Machine" sticks to the basics of producer George Pal's opus, but Wells and Logan have dispensed with H.G. Wells' socialist commentary. The worst thing that Alex complains about here is bowing to the fashion dictates of the day and wearing a bowler hat. Meanwhile, "The Time Machine" departs even farther, including a disaster involving the Moon instead of a meteor and an explosive "Stargate" ending that obliterates the depraved Uber-Morlock adversary (a long-haired Jeremy Irons of "Dungeons &amp; Dragons"). Irons relies on his scary white make-up and black lip-liner to churn up chills, but he doesn't appear long enough on screen to make much of an impact. The phony Morlocks make a mild impression as the dastards of this film. Stan Winston, who designed these evil creatures, blew it on these thugs. They have faces like wooden Hawaii masks. Indeed, they look cool when they kidnap their victims and descend like the Martians from "Invaders from Mars" (1953) into the earth. Not only have Wells and Logan turned the classic Wells' tale into a turgid tearjerker, but they also have concocted a laughable, anti-technology manifesto, too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was fine up until he reaches the far future. It looked like "Planet Of The Apes". The Eloi were not noble, they hadn't evolved, they'd devolved, just in a different direction from the Morloch. In the 1960 version, I could see good reasons for staying in the future with Weena. I see no attraction or desirability in staying in the world of this movie's Eloi.I think H.G's grandson could have done much better.The 1960 version was far superior. This one had no humour, no wit, and the cast were pedestrian apart from Vox and the head Morloch.Rent or buy the 1960 version instead, or just buy the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guy Pearce took advantage of his Memento fame to appear in two 2002 medium-sized hits ? The Time Machine and The Count of Monte Cristo; only to drop off the face of (cinematic) Earth later on. In this moving remake, however, we get to watch him in the roll of the haunted Alexander Hartdegen, a tormented science professor who cracks the equator that discovers time-travel in 19th century England, only to find out he can't save his beloved fiancée from dying. This tragic twist sends our protagonist looking for his salvation in the future ? flash forwarding to as far as the 8,028th century. Capitalizing more on the love story, this H.G. Wells adaptation fails to take proper advantage of the Eloi and Morlock sub-arc, but still remains intact as a heart-breaking, thought-provoking Sci-Fi adventure, even if somewhat flawed at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched it in cinema, then bought the DVD immediately after its release. Why? Because I think it's a really great film. Okay, sometimes it lacks credibility and leaves questions unanswered, but generally I loved it.The landscape is amazing, it took my breath away watching the beautiful canyon with the Eloi's dwellings at its cliffs. The view of the busted moon wandering along the sky left me amazed.The music is incredible, I loved listening to Enya while Alexander sits in the boat moving towards the Eloi towers.Jeremy Irons and Guy Pearce give us some quite memorable quotes, especially Irons as the Über-Morlock who radiates charisma, wisdom and a feeling of eternity that compare to none others.In general, a can really recommend to watch this picture, you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure whether I would like this one or not, as I am not the biggest time travel / Science Fiction nut out there, but seeing how much I like Guy Pearce, I decided to give this one a go... Ugh, was I wrong. 'The Time Machine' is what it is, Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a early century mathemticican who is obsessed with building a time machine to go back in time to rescue his fiancée from death, when that proves inconclusive (she just KEEPS dying lol), he decides to go AHEAD in time to find out how he can change the past. WHAT? That doesn't really make a lot of sense. Methinks he should have done the Bill Murray thing and just keep trying.. Or is a Final Destination factor in place **whatever**, anyways, Pearce, conveniently knocked out for reasons too stupid to discuss here, goes like 20,000 years into the future, where the people don't speak English anymore, are hunted by beings down below, and yadayadayada. Look this is just ridiculous. Guy Pearce just looks strange in this movie.But not as strange as Jeremy Irons. Ha ha!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time Machine, well I think there is no need to explain what the movie is about.. It is that classic struggle of a man whose mind is beyond his time and that mind sets off when his one and only love is killed, so he builds a time machine (made of wood) to save her but apparently time is seriously related to fate.. Then he says "let's test if it goes forward" and travels to our distant future and when audience learns that we are stupid enough to dig moon with explosives he knocks himself unconscious, gets into his time vehicle and sets it to full throttle.. Surely, the faaaaar future (say like, 800000 years) is in ruins.. But can there be a future for him there? OK, story is a little suspicious.. I admit that I haven't read the book but since the book is a classic, the story was taken apart and manipulated into many other forms so that now when author's grandson tries to make his grandpa's story into a motion picture he is accused of using a banal story.. Ironic.What I really enjoyed in the beginning was the laboratory of our mad scientist.. It was filled with interesting stuff and proves that art department did a lot of work. There is a nice reference to Einstein and so on.. Then comes the scene where he travels to future and that scene was beautiful, a glory for CGI, totally professional. Just that scene worths the entire effect of the movie.. OK, enough about the spoilers..Guy Pearce is not bad as usual.. He looks good in a suit. Samantha Mumba as well, but she looks in that torn apart dress.. Jeremy Irons is of course always great but his downfall was the little screen time given to him.. I think Orlando Jones was really interesting as the holographic interface 'Vox', making him the best in the movie. Also Mark Addy's last scene was great..Overall, movie loses most from having a overused storyline and confusing the audience.. What were those things? How could they know what happened to Earth and speak English after 800000, or how Vox could still stand (even though his future scenes were really really nice).. Not to mention there are tons of inconsistencies with time travel (compared to what we learned from sci-fi and Harry Potter), and cast was not mindblowingly great.. But these aren't unique for this movie; there are tons of other movies who have stupid stories and impossibly good endings.. And when they are subtracted movie mixes different eras pretty nicely, and one enjoys if the movie is watched without great expectations (or 'high') Considering that I still have some good memories about the movie (I watched it twice: 1-when it was out, 2-five minutes ago) and the great effort made by art and CGI departments the movie deserves at least 6 stars, since Guy Pearce looks slick in suit I make it 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excuse me if I'm curt, but time is of the essence...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2002 remake of The Time Machine is pretty much the crappiest movie I have ever seen on cable television. Of course I couldn't sit through the whole film and if anyone out there did you are a fool and have no concept of "enough is enough". First of all, the original version starring Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux is a timeless classic. The special effects were ahead of it's time and the performances were pulled off flawlessly and believable considering the subject matter. Wonderfully casted and skillfully directed, this film really did not need to be bastardized. This is equally just as bad of an idea as that pretentious hack Gus Van Sant remaking a Hitchcock film.It just doesn't need to be done. And poor Guy Pearce didn't know just what a piece of doo-doo brown he was agreeing to star in. I will admit that the few scenes that I saw with Samantha Mumba kept me glued to the screeen in hopes that her hair would quit covering her see-through chainmail shirt. She has nice legs and smooth skin, so I won't blame her for my horrible cinematic experience. But her performance was pretty lame as well. Anyone who thinks she has acting potential is just too embarassed to say they think she's a fine looker and want to get crunk with that booty.But I'm already spending too much time on this "review", so let's get to the meat of the matter. The Moorlocks look like a family of Cryptkeepers with nappy dreads and the ostrich noises emanating from their pieholes is sooooo played out. Even the Moorlocks of the original film looked 12 times creepier. And once again we are subjected to embarrasingly bad CGI effects and a musical score reminiscent of the poor man's Enya. Sounds like a joyous theater experience eh? I hope this film keeps the director Simon West from ever shooting any form of film ever again. Perhaps he could get a job developing film at Walmart. That's my word! I'm outta here.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was I the only person who thought the best things in this film were Samantha Mumba's breasts? What does this say about the film? For that matter, what does it say about Samantha Mumba, agreeing to wear what amounted to a transparent top without a bra beneath it? Shame on director Simon Wells for such tawdry exploitation but it would have been more tedious to sit through this movie had he had more moral integrity. Perhaps he knew his film was lacking in other areas! My goodness was I bored. I was almost falling asleep and thinking up all sorts of time machine jokes about racing to the end of the film! I seemed to have drifted into a time vortex, as 95 minutes warped into 300! This film is awful. In terms of its construction, it is so flawed that Simon Wells' experience as a storyteller must immediately come under scrutiny. What was all this nonsense of the fiancée dying? This whole fiasco could and should have been implied because it merely served to fill up the running time with an utterly predictable and clichéd reason for the invention; a reason that is neither plausible nor true to the book. People don't knock together time machines in their grief! When will directors making book adaptations learn to accept that the novelist is the better writer? This ?first act' struck me as nothing more than a chance for the director to get some experience doing a period piece (and badly at that). Any fool should know that what the audience wants is the action, the meat of the story, and the longer the film takes to get them to this, the worse the film will be. We don't want to see the protagonist _going_ to the party; we want to come in at the point where the party is in full swing! Blimey, this is basic stuff folks! The special effects are cheap-looking, the time machine looks implausibly visually spectacular and shiny, there are mind-numbingly stupid things throughout like the remarkable chance that someone who speaks ancient English (and when I say ancient I really mean it!) just happens to be standing right next to our hero when he first arrives in the distant future. At this point we are given some crude expository dialogue explaining not only _this_ miracle but also that this linguist is the only person who speak the tongue yet at the end of the movie we see children speaking English and the hero telling them the story of his adventures! We have the admittedly well designed and fearsome morlocks inexplicably attacking with blow darts when they are obviously more than capable of overpowering their prey without them, notwithstanding that the darts themselves apparently had no effect. But to top the countless stupidities in the film, is the utterly incomprehensible plot. I have read the book and seen the original version of it, and seen numerous other time travel films and been an avid Dr. Who fan for years, but I failed to make neither head nor tail of this movie. I came to the IMDb to see if anyone else understood the plot but from the reviews I've read here it seems that other viewers were either too bored to bother trying to check the plot or so easily pleased that a consistent plot wasn't of any concern to them! Jeremy Irons role was utter rubbish; I see that some other ?reviewers' have seen fit to sing his praises again like he is some sort of acting genius but the reality is that he has sunk to the role of old ?has been' living on a reputation made decades ago, and taking pathetic token roles in dubious movies. It all played like the producers looked at the script, felt it needed a ?name' to bolster it, went to the bargain basement for Jeremy (no disrespect intended - get yourself a new agent Mr. Irons) and then doctored the script to create a role for him with enough ?gravitas' to get him to agree to be in it. On the plus side, there is competent cinematography and a nice location has been found for a tiny amount of shots to showcase this. Having said this, overall the movie feels like it was made indoors. There is some other competent work from the art department with the sets, costume (less impressive) and makeup/prosthetics. Best of all were the time lapse scenes generated on computer to show the changing landscape when the time machine hurtles into the future although obviously there was little of this. So all in all, in was no wonder that I spent most of my time watching the beautiful Miss Mumba in that eye-popping costume of hers. So unless you are a movie scholar wanting to see fundamental errors in filmmaking or a salacious Mumba fan, save yourself some time (hehe) and money and give this a miss. * out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, The Bad, And The Eloi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new "Time Machine" retains its Edwardian time period and much of its familiar plot, but has been transported from London to New York City. The time traveler's name is now Alexander Hartdegen (there's a limerick in there somewhere), a part well-played by Guy Pearce, who, befitting his genius character, looks a bit drawn here.One fateful night, absent-minded scientist Alex nearly forgets an important date with Emma, his hoped-for fiancé-to-be. Beautiful Sienna Guillory makes an impressive though brief appearance as Emma. She lights up the screen with her presence (her resemblance to Jessica Lange is so strong, she could be her daughter).Unexpected events upset Alex's plans and set him to work creating a time machine? and after four or five self-denying years of intensive labor, he succeeds. It's a nicely designed contraption, too, one that puts its own stamp on the archetypal "spinning" design from the 1960 film. It looks right, like it actually might work. Suspension of disbelief is further aided by several early allusions to Alex's brilliance (for example, a humorous reference is made to an unknown Albert Einstein needing his advice).So into the past Alex rushes, with barely a beta-test or concern. And when he again hooks up with Emma for their date, does she notice any change in him? After so long a time (on his part only) of sleep deprived obsession, mightn't she have said "Darling, you've aged five years overnight!"Alas, Alex soon discovers that destiny cannot be altered (for some reason this revelation provoked audience laughter, though I thought it was handled skillfully enough). Dejected, he journeys into the far future, stopping once or twice to explore mankind's progress. In the film's first of many unintentionally comic missteps, he leaves his machine unattended in an improbably empty urban space, where no one interferes with it. No thief, vandal or policeman gives this big, expensive-looking curiosity a second glance? in New York?It's during Alex's initial excursion into a near-future Manhattan that we enter Truly Heinous territory. Alex visits the New York Public Library and meets Vox, a holographic librarian (a miscast Orlando Jones). When Alex asks this talking "encyclopedia of all the world's knowledge" about time travel, Vox scoffs at the concept as nothing but fiction, citing H.G. Wells' famous book and the 1960 movie. Vox claims to be tortured by never forgetting anything. Indeed, when he ultra-improbably meets Alex 800,000 years in the future, he recalls their previous conversation? but does he mention that ol' H.G. was uncannily prescient?The film continues to lose its bearings as tens of thousands of years pass. Rivers form, mountains erode, yet when we arrive in the year 802,701, words chiseled into 20th Century NYC stonework are still clearly legible! Apparently, humanity has not changed all that much, either. For one thing, their background music sounds like the "Lion King" soundtrack (and I thought the faux-tribal music in "Return of the Jedi" was embarrassing).Alex soon meets one-half of humanity's descendants, the Eloi, including beautiful Mara (Samantha Mumba) and her young son, who speak English. This seems ludicrous even after we learn that virtual Vox continues to hold court in the nearby NYPL ruins (that is one amazing computer warranty!).In the 1960 movie, the Eloi were appropriately weak and passive, like effete teenagers. Blonde and blandly good-looking, they reflected fears of the future based on the dominant youth culture of the time. The new Eloi also reflect popular culture. With their tribal tattoos and glistening dark skin, they are like fiercely beautiful MTV rockers. Yet despite prominent muscles, they remain inexplicably defenseless against the evil Morlocks.Alex and Mara bond just in time for her to be carried off (in daylight?) by the flesh-eating Morlocks. Alex heroically follows into no-man's land, where he encounters the Über-Morlock (Jeremy Irons). In a rush of exposition, the telepathic Ü.M. explains how Man became two races, but the scene is totally confusing, and at this point both Mr. Irons and the plot become superfluous.Strangely, actors Yancey Arias and Philip Bosco are also prominently billed, yet neither, as far as I could discern, appear in the movie. Perhaps their deleted scenes contained material that might have helped hold the film together? Spoiler Alert It's absurd to quibble by this point (spoilers ahead!), but the film loses all remaining vestiges of credibility in the final minutes. For example, Ü.M. warns that without his powers there would be no control over the Morlocks, who would otherwise quickly exhaust their food supply (people). Nevertheless, Alex dispatches him -- and we must pray, all remaining Morlocks -- by causing his machine to meltdown. How did Alex know how to destroy his machine, what would happen when he did, and that all the Morlocks were in range? And how lucky he and his Eloi friends were to so narrowly escape the blast radius! Also, the overall time concepts lacked sense. Alex changes the destiny of Mara and the Eloi? so why was it impossible for him to change his own destiny?There are some excellent visuals in "The Time Machine," and nice special effects. Turn of the century New York is very pretty, as is the hanging cliff-village of the future. The best effect is too brief and involves Earth's moon breaking apart. Later, when we see the partially disintegrated moon and its detritus in an orbital ring around the Earth, it's very cool.Unfortunately, there's not enough of this, and not enough creativity or playfulness in the time-travel itself. In a movie largely dependent on special effects, that's the stuff that should have been enlarged upon. There's a great money shot showing the growth of a technological Earth, but it comes too soon. The small, changing details as seen from the time traveler's point of view were much more effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film. I enjoyed the book very very much when I read it years ago and saw the earlier film version. I certainly didn't expect a line by line remake of the novel on screen but I expected some kind of continuity. I was wrong. First of all, a love story? Excuse me? Where did this come from? Why, when the "Time Traveler's" reasons for his journey in the book were so noble, did the screenwriter feel the need to provide a hokey and ill-used love story to push Alex's need to know? I didn't think they would keep the long philosophical debate that takes place in the opening chapters of the book (though I suppose it would have been fascinating to see), but I had hoped that the noble ideals of knowledge and discovery would be enough of a motive for our wayward time traveller to embark upon a journey into the unknown folds of time and space....apparently not for today's audiences..we require a "heart wrenching" love story to spark some kind of interest. The King Morlock? A psionically endowed underworld creature?Stupid, stupid. Disappointment in the extreme. Things I did like: The look of the time machine. The Eloi village..very earthy, well done. The makeup of the Morlocks. The view of the women's dress shop while time travelling...the shortening of the skirts was an artful, cute touch. Wait to see this film on video or DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is an acceptable rendition from H.G.Wells novel . In fact , a picture of H.G. Wells is visible in Alexander's house in several shots . Before being filmed by George Pal with the starring Rod Taylor . Here the star is Guy Pearce who gives a good playing . The film deals about time travel because his girlfriend played by Sienna Guillory has been killed and Guy Pearce who invents a device tries to go back in time with the aim to reborn her . But the time travel machine was ahead at future world where inhabit the evil Morlocks who rule over the good Eloi . There Pearce lives dangerous and frustrating experiences.This exciting movie mingles noisy adventures , franctic action , a love story , drama , breathtaking special effects and results to be very amusing . Originally scheduled for December 2001 , the release was bumped to March 2002 because of a decision whether to remove a scene involving a meteor shower which crippled New York . The producers were concerned that such a scene may stir memories of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center . Interesting adaptation by prestigious John Logan , also co-producer , who equally wrote the Eloi language . Guy Pearce stars the main role giving a cool acting . He did most of his own stunts , and occasionally got frustrated when he wasn't allowed to do a few . As Guy Pearce broke a rib during the filming when he tackled the Morlock from the side . The support cast is agreeable , singer Samantha Mumba is nice , Mark Addy is rightly , Jeremy Irons plays an incredible villain person and Orlando Jones plays a humorous acting , as always . The cinematography by Donald McLlpine and musical score by Klaus Badlet is excellent , direction by Simon Welles (H.G.Wells'descendant) is first-rate . However , Gore Verbinski was brought in to take over the last 18 days of shooting, as Simon Wells was suffering from "extreme exhaustion" ; later on , Wells returned for post-production . Rating: 7 , entertaining and charming .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Box Office proves how bad this film is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I already did comment on how bad this film was per se, but also about how bad it was, when you considered that it was based on such a great novel, and that it was a much more expensive remake of a 1960 version.As usual on such sites there have been a few long, favourable "user comments", which sound a lot like micromarketing, vs. real users...One of them insisted that the film was a box office success.Well, here is the data. On the 2nd week of March, Time Machine was 1st at the box office. On the 3rd week of March it was 4th, on the 4th week it was 7th. And it has disappeared from the top 10 since then.It would be nice if studios stopped polluting sites with micro-marketing, particularly as poorly disguised as it is these days.Save your money, do not go see the Time Machine, 2002 version. See the 1960 version instead (available on DVD), and read the book, which is outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was recommended to me by a very close friend a huge fan of Sci Fi just like me but this movie made no sense at all. I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 because when the protagonist first makes his time machine he realizes that his fiancé will die anyway. that was nice, I wish there was something of how complicated time machine concept it etc etc,. I haven't read the book though and I would have read for sure if I haven't seen this movie in the first place.Much place to develop and hopefully much better ideas to improve the movie is definitely on the table . And at the end, the friend of the protagonist throws his hat away showing his happiness. And what is he happy about? He just lost his friend who suffered from a serious setback in his life. he said that he may have found a better place but this gesture does not show his concern he was depicting in the earlier part of movie. Total Disaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing this movie briefly flash by on cable, I was reminded of how I felt when I shelled out good money to see it at a theatre. Ripped off and insulted that the film-makers think I don't know something terrible when I see it. For God's sake, even the George Pal movie version of this story from 1960 adheres more closely to the original story! I guess I was hoping that the technological advances of special effects would finally see this story done right, but what do we get? A love story which never appears in the Wells novel, sequences that "borrow" from the 1960 version,most notably the "changing fashions" in the shop window, and a sort of action-movie ending with a totally gratuitous Jeremy Irons as the Uber-Morlock (a character made up for the film to explain the whole future mess in a five minute speech)who rots away in yet another stolen moment from the 1960 version. Those reviewers here that proudly state "I've never read the book so this movie is good enough" are exactly why moviemakers dumb everything down. Simon Wells should be pretty ashamed of doing such an injustice to his ancestor's great work. An incredibly stupid movie with no connection to it's namesake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was too much that was stupid about this movie for me to enjoy it even a little bit: A)The obsession with the dead girlfriend that leads to the development of the time machine. Not believable and not close to inspired plot development. B)The fact that, even after 800,000 years of evolution, the bad guys have to run out and capture their food. Why not just farm it and save yourselves a lot of effort? Even mortals thousands and thousands of years earlier knew that. C)What, they can't produce their own offspring? They have to steal breeders from the other group? How in God's name did they survive that little evolutionary "oops?"? D) A 100-lb woman and a skinny 800,000-year-old man manage to outrun (in a tunnel, no less) enraged monkey-like creatures who can scale the sides of walls and are shown to be running at least 60 mph while our heroes are practically limping their way out. That's a pretty inspired escape. These two need to try out for the Olympic track team. They'd blow Michael Johnson right away. This is only the most egregious examples. The whole movie was bad, really. Although Jeremy Irons is one of my favorites and seems to be the only really interesting character(and has some of the best quotes), he's only on the screen a few minutes and is wasted. Don't bother with this one. You'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst films I have seen in a long time.How someone can take as great a book as Wells' Time Machine and turn it into that meaningless blurb beats me. Wells was a very smart writer, with sometimes scary visions of what the future could hold in store for humankind - why ignore all this?Back in the 1960's they had less technology to produce special effects, so they USED THEIR BRAINS, and they had read Wells' book, and apparently understood the message. So in spite of their primitive special effects the film is still great to watch today.Whereas this tasteless, dumb 2002 version will probably be forgotten by next year - good riddance.Antoine</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I went to see "Beautiful Mind"....but it was sold out. Next available movie, "Time Machine".The "What if?" question I will ask myself from now on is..."What if we just decided to park in front of a brick wall and stare at it for 2 hours??" At least with a brick wall, I know what to expect.I've seen the earlier versions of The Time Machine. All this movie had to do was remake it with new CG technology to make the travel sequences a bit more interesting. And, with Guy Pearce as the lead, we just might have something. Well, what you get is pretty bad.....no, make that downright awful. So bad, my wife fell asleep within 30 minutes.In all fairness, the first 15-20 minutes had my attention. The story was moving along and his motivation was logical. However, the moment he got off his little Time Taxi and landed in 2090-something...the story fell to pieces. It was getting silly, lost, ridiculous, laughable, stupid......ever seen Highlander 2?The rest of the movie is just one big spoiler. It is NOT a satisfactory remake of the original. As many other users have commented, there is just too much missing and everything seems rushed. AND WHAT IS IT WITH THE HOLOGRAPHIC GUY??? You've just GOT to be kidding!! It was the most idiotic script mistake and it played as corny as you can get. DID YOU SEE HIM PAT THE SKULL ON THE HEAD??? "Alas poor Morlock, I knew him well".SO dissappointing. Save your hard earned money and rent the original. As for Mr. Pearce, I hope he got paid well....this is not going to look good on his resume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone is saying it, but you probably don't understand/believe it if you haven't read the book. I'm going to repeat it one last time, then give you a little metaphor: This movie has nothing to do with the original masterpiece that is the original book. To represent that statement, let's take a famous, good book that everyone has read. Winnie the Pooh for example. And now let's give it the movie equivalent of what Simon Wells' The Time Machine (2002) is to The Time Machine (the book).In this movie called "Winnie the Pooh":1/ Christopher Robin is named Bryan Jones. 2/ Bryan Jones is a 24 year old young man with a traumatic past. This traumatic past takes 34 minutes of the movie. 3/ He lost his girlfriend in a violent car accident (shown on screen), and is now having delusions. 4/ Winnie The Pooh is a giant robot with machine guns instead of his arms. 5/ Bryan Jones befriend Pooh and together they decide to save the Earth. 6/Tigger has been turned into a hot young female with big breasts who has a romance with Bryan Jones while he saves the Earth.etc. See? That is probably what Simon Wells would produce if he ever had to do a Winnie the Pooh movie. Thank God, after that Time Machine movie, he's probably been barred from a Hollywood set for the rest of his life. Honestly. Read the book. It's fun, intelligent, short (you need an hour or two to read it), is both adventurous and riddled with interesting social and Darwinian commentary without being too geeky. And, as it's now free of rights, it's findable everywhere on the internet or your iPhone/iPad for free! No excuse!</fullReview>

The entire beginning of the movie was not in the H.G. Wells story and didn't need to be. Also the Eloi were done completely wrong. They did build houses or form any kind of real society. They didn't care about each other at all. That was an important part of the story. The way they had formed a world that was without hardship or complex emotions. They were barely even aware of the Morlocks. I don't know why this movie was made the way it was but some stories should be told as they are or left alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unnecessary remake of the still-excellent 1960s film, which hewed reasonably close to the Wells novel. Guy Pearce is OK as the hero, but he has to carry the film and it is simply not a particularly good film. It is based on the Wells novel in name only, discarding the social commentary (and practically everything else) in favor of a CGI extravaganza that throws all logic and caution out the window. It also resets the action to New York City, with an opening that played like a SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE spoof! The Morlocks were certainly no improvement over their 1960s counterparts, and their hunting excursions in daylight removed all suspense and sense of terror. The Eloi were certainly not Wells' Eloi; they were more like the stranded gang of youngsters that Mel Gibson befriends and rescues in MAD MAX 3. The time machine itself looked like a glass pipe organ. The Uber Morlock was a direct swipe from similar characters at the end of BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES, and not very interesting. The fight to the death between the Uber Morlock and the hero was unconvincing and smelled of contrivance, as did the destruction of the Morlocks' underground city. Skip this one and rewatch the 1960 version.</fullReview>

But this must have been just what the director wanted - or it would never have made the final cut. The story line is tragically laughable - a significant part of our preview audience even laughed out loud as a woman was run down by a runaway carriage. I had to agree with them.Jeremy Irons will be haunted to his grave for accepting his role and most of the audience will be haunted by the thought of the million and one other things they could have been doing with this part of their lives.The only consolation is that it's comparatively short.</fullReview>

We went in, and simply waited for it to end... there was nothing gained by seeing it. It had a good premise, and a phenomenal budget to spend on special effects, but the movie overall was completely lacking substance. Despite some entertaining action sequences, and of course, the big Hollywood effects, there was nothing keeping me in the story. As shown in the trailer, there is nothing to inspire you to see what happens. It could have been more emotional and it could have been more consistent.

		<fullReview>With a heavy-handed forward pressure on the crystal lever, H. G. Wells' "The Time Machine" eludes the latest cinematic attempt to capture the story's mix of Victorian charm and vision of man's future ? despite being helmed by H. G.'s great-grandson, Simon Wells.With the effects available today, one could be forgiven for thinking that this time everything would favour the filmmakers. There was also the advantage of being able to view the 1960 George Pal version, thus avoiding some of the pitfalls in translating the story to the screen. But therein lies the problem because the script is only loosely based on the original story; it is as though the screenwriter's knowledge of Wells' tale came from a chat over coffee with somebody who had read the book twenty years before.The film that emerged is so derivative of other movies that the source for these should have been listed in the end credits. Following in the footsteps of fellow Aussie, Rod Taylor, from the 1960 version, Guy Pearce plays the Time Traveller, Alexander Hartdegen. The filmmakers introduced some original touches to the story with varying degrees of success. After an early sequence involving the death of Hartegen's fiancée, and his attempts to journey into the past on his time machine, he decides to go forward to learn of the future of mankind. He discovers that due to a failed attempt to colonise the moon, it has begun to break up causing great changes on Earth. During a stopover on his journey in the New York Public Library, Hartdegen discovers a holographic, animatronic teacher, played by Connie Ray. Although the robot is used to explain what is happening to life on Earth, he also does double duty as a wise cracking commentator seemingly inspired by Robin William's genie in Disney's "Aladdin". Hartdegen presses on to the year 802701AD and stops. Almost immediately he becomes involved with the Eloi who live in clifftop dwellings. But now the film departs from the novel not just in detail but also in basic motivation. The Eloi already speak English while their civilisation is presented as a cross between 1970's hippie culture and the tribes from "Stargate".The female lead in the film, the exotic and full figured Samantha Mumba as Mara, fails to measure up to the more petite Yvette Mimeaux who played Weena in the 1960 version, but it's hardly her fault; there is no build-up or tension involved in Hartdegen's discovery of the Eloi world.Worse is to come. The other essential element in Wells' tale is the Morlocks; those subterranean dwellers that prey on the Eloi at night. It is the Morlocks that provide the strongest sense of deja vu. Not only do they seem to have lost their fear of light, essential to the plot in the original story, but they also embody nothing less than a reunion of old friends; there are traces of the creatures from "Alien", "The Mole People", "Planet of the Apes", and do we detect a little Freddy Kruger in there? The familiarity becomes uncanny when we meet the Uber Morlock played by Jeremy Irons. If Anthony Hopkins ever relinquishes the Hannibal Lector franchise, Jeremy Irons could use his role in this movie as his CV for the part. Eventually, the battle between the Time Traveller and the Uber Morlock owes more to the "Terminator" series than to H. G. Wells.The ending, rather than Wells' death of the sun, opts for a ray of sunshine instead with Hartdegen at last finding a home with the Eloi. He encourages a thirst for learning among the Eloi children and introduces them to a teacher, the Connie Ray character who has endured through the centuries; better in fact than the time machine. "What if" is a phrase that is repeated throughout the film, and it could serve as the plaintiff cry of anyone who loves the original story, enjoyed the Pal version, but always hoped that a contemporary filmmaker would finally do the story justice ? I'm afraid we have waited in vain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I read the book so....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie isn't bad, it's actually entertaining and I am not so bothered by the time traveler having made the time machine to save his love. But....HG Wells is one of my favorite authors, not so much that he was an exceptionally good writer, more that he had exceptionally good concepts - many are still relevant to today with some changes for advancements in science. Take the Island of Dr. Moreau and apply it to DNA research. Think War of the Worlds and how cautious NASA is to not spread organisms from Earth to Mars. Knowing what the book is about, I couldn't sit through this movie and just enjoy it because all I can think is, "That's not what happens!" Granted the book might not translate well into a movie, I think, it would take more skill anyway. I have seen the 1960's version and it is closer to this version than the book also. So I am going to talk about the book so you can understand my protestations.The book the Time Machine is a joke! Literally, it is a joke, a satire of modern society. Wells was British and he is making fun of the aristocracy saying they are lazy pretty fools who would only be useful if they were food for the working class man. Humanity has evolved into two distinct species. The Eloi are pretty, lazy, carefree and stupid - they are the descendants of aristocrats. The morlocks are industrious, resourceful, and hardworking who due to certain events have been forced to live underground - the working man. The eloi are able to survive because the morlocks provide for them, do you see the satire? The time traveler in the book prefers the morlocks and holds the elois in contempt - yup, he prefers the creepy underground-dwelling night creatures who eat the eloi. Why? Because they are hard-workers as opposed to the eloi who engage in folly all day long. The eloi Weena (now Mara) who follows the time traveler around gets left in the woods to either be burned to death or captured by the morlocks and guess what? The time traveler isn't sure what her fate is nor is he too worried about it. So, leave it to cinema to praise the pretty idiot and kill the hard working man. I'm guessing an American audience is what inspired the change and removed the symbolism. We think of wealth as something attainable through innovation and hard work. We believe in social mobility and don't see being rich as something simply bestowed by inheritance (though sometimes it is). Ane we also don't have an aristocracy. If you liked the movie, you might not want read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will be more brief than the commentator I just tried to read, the first up on the shovel. THE TIME MACHINE might in fact be "pure fun," and it might be slow going at first (a 20 year old's analysis), but by the standards of this turn of the century -- and especially the film industry -- the original novel would be considered "boring, boring."The 2002 movie is a total prostitution of Well's 1890s masterpiece. Like much of Hollywood (broadly defined), it must perforce offer spectacular effects (sic), love interest(s) (implied by Wells too), gunplay (omitted by Wells, an Englishman), and optional gross-out (i.e. Mr Irons's Moorlock).The original had violence, and the baleful social (dis)order of the far future was described by the author. THE TIME MACHINE was not "parlour science fiction." It was, however, created with a deft hand and the new motion picture could have honoured such artistry, but like hey man, it wasn't like Now, you know what I'm sayin'?"Now" is defined as an adolescent caper, over done, with much too much added and original quality omitted. And then there is the need for that Amercian Ending, and the kid angle. Sickening.If it fails at the box office I am glad. It is too bad much good film fails too. Someday -- will I live to see it? -- somebody will do a proper job, a cable movie company, or perhaps Merchant Ivory, or maybe WGBH/BBC. Herbert George Wells, his language, scientific imagination, and social commentary deserves much better. The unreconstructed socialist would see the 2002 and muse, yes, a flawed capitalistic future and its child-like clientele.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The pacing of the movie in the beginning was extremely slow, and yet there was hardly enough character development for you to feel for either the main character or his love interest. Granted, the detail taken to create an authentic Victorian era backdrop was nice eye-candy, but the main characters were so flatly written, they could have easily faded into that backdrop.Even after things begin to pick up speed, there is a definite sense of disjointedness, as if from the beginning of the movie Alexander (Guy Pearce) knows he doesn't belong where he is. This wasn't done well, like it was in "The Sixth Sense."Visually, this movie was somewhat a disappointment. All the other aspects of this film were a major disappointment. As we left the theater, we all agreed this film had so much potential, and yet it fell well short. The acting was strained, the script overworked, and the massive amounts of special effects did nothing to cover up all these shortcomings. No matter how much icing you use to cover up a brick, it's still a brick.As much as I wanted this film to be a great sci-fi masterpiece to enjoy through time, I am afraid the new version of "The Time Machine" will wind down and die like a cheap watch. Jeremy Irons should be thankful for his limited screen time, his career should be able to absorb a bad movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see most reviews slammed the movie for being 'uneven' in tone. To which I say, so what? We're all adults - we don't need to be coddled with a consistent mood. Why should a movie that starts whimsical and amusing have to stay that way? It wouldn't have made sense to have the initial 19th century episode scary and full of foreboding. And there wouldn't have been the same shock value when the Morlocks finally did appear. It's not like the movie was continually shuttling back and forth between light-hearted and horrific. So bollocks to the critics who claim not to be impressed. They tend to find fault with populist studio films, anyway. I say some movies have too much going on in plot, set design, and special effects to be brought down by 'uneven tone'. That being said, the ending was a bit rushed. I'd like a full, pitched battle between Eloi and Morlocks in the sequel, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie made...worse?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(MINOR SPOILERS)I saw a press screening of this new version of the 1960 classic Sci-fi of the same name. I have to admit, just as I walked into the new version of (also 1960) "Ocean's 11" I kept thinking "Why make a new version of a movie that's already made great?". Coming out from "Ocean's 11" I felt that the original was better, coming out from "The Time Machine" I...had almost the same feeling.I'm not going to talk about the original any more than that. I can't remember it good enough to compare the two, but I'm definitely going to try to get it and see it again to see if I remember it correctly as a better movie than the new version.Basically, the storyline is about the scientist Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) in the end of the 19:th century that loses his fiancée in a robbery turned murder. Obsessed with this, he tries to build a time machine - and after 4 years he manages. Going back in time to save the girl, all that happens is that she's killed in a different way. Instead of going back to his own time, Alexander decides to travel into the future to try to find out why he can't change the past, at least not the fundemental things (people dying for example).Alexander travels into a bright and technical future, where he runs into a computer (Orlando Jones) who defines time travel as science fiction. Then, something goes terribly wrong and Alexander is knocked out while travelling and ends up some 800 000 years into the future. This world is nothing like the one we know, but man has gone back to the state we were long before the Egyptians built pyramids...I'd like to think that the biggest enjoyment in this film are the two famous actors who are least seen on screen; Jeremy Irons and Orlando Jones. Had they been given more space, hade the script been a bit stronger and maybe changed a bit more from the original, this might actually have been a really good movie experience. Now, however, it's just another decent sci-fi flick that will probably go away as just that.I'd give it 5/10 at most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the whimsical naivety of a child, a man torn by fate sets out on a mission...to change the past by going into the future.I saw it at a screening last night, and I have to say...this film has far exceeded my highest expectations. The sheer brilliance left me mulling it over for hours. I became impassioned....very rare for a movie with little hype. Perhaps it was low expectations...or perhaps this will be considered a classic by critics....most definitely by me. Rest assured that this work of art will surprise even the most skeptical. I have to say that I am impressed. The language that the Eros (?) speak was actually translated....they DEVELOPED a language according to Samantha Mumba (the futuristic Planet of the Apes type chick). Very few directors go to such lengths to make a seamless movie. I have to say...the last scene is what really got me...and I'm not going to tell you...you just have to wait! Believe me..you'll thank me for it. Their world was very believable..and most of the characters did a very good job. The visual effects were not new, however, with the circumstances involved in the movie...the contrast between the "now" (for him) and the "later" are mind blowing. I was also amazed that both of the main female characters came across as beautiful and alluring, without being sleazy...as they are normally cast. It was indeed refreshing. I didn't hear any cuss words...and this seems an ok kid movie...except perhaps one scene in the dungeons of the monkey type people. And in that scene...well, it was truly disgusting. The film had high production values, which really makes it eye candy at times. I was so amazed and delighted that I give it a 9...which I have never done before. Go see it.....trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More a comment on Wells and the 1960 film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a remake and it is not a sequel. It is more a play on the ideas of Wells and of the 1960 film. The movie seems a little slight and rushed, but it is not at all bad as a short science fiction story. With a little too much digital effects it will become dated, but it is still worth the trip for science fiction fans. In the late 19th Century and American scientist invents a time machine in an attempt to modify the past. In spite of his being able to get to the past, he cannot alter anything of substance. Instead he explores the future and finds that it has undergone the same split of humanity that Wells predicted, Eloi and Morlocks. (The time traveler is apparently not familiar with The Time Machine, but a sort of digital librarian he meets is.) This is not a great SF film, but it was a lot better than I was expecting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been excited to see this movie for a while, since it got backed up a couple months, but it was worth the wait. The script was a little rocky at the beginning but once the time travel starts it became really spectacular. I thought that the visual effects were well used. From the preview the visual effects didn't look that good, but when you are in the theatre watching the film they show their impressiveness, if that is a word. The acting was very strong from Guy Pearce and Samantha Mumba. Yes, that is Samantha Mumba the singer, now also actress. I think she has a very promising acting career ahead of her. I would recommend this film to all ages and I would be more than willing to see the film again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simon Wells rides Grandad's machine into a parallel dimension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried to watch this film with an open mind. After all, it's not an easy task to turn a short novella into a full feature length film. And, given that this and all of H.G. Wells' stories are told by first-person narration, it would take some careful adaptation to preserve the tone of the book, much of which takes place in the narrator's own head as he attempts to rationalise the world he has been thrust into, as any pragmatic man of science would. If that sounds dull to you, worry not, because this is not a careful adaptation, it's Hollywood. To their credit, they didn't cast Brendan Fraser as the time traveller, but when you see the way they hacked up the script, they might as well have.Spoiler time, so only read on if you've seen it - or don't plan to, which is a fine idea, since this film is now 12 years old and the intervening years have spawned a number of other bombs on which you could waste an hour and a half of your life.I'll begin at the beginning, which is the first thing they ruined. The beginning of H.G. Wells' novel is full of charm and mystery that sets the scene. Time's been kind to this story, unlike some of Wells' work, and there was an opportunity to tell a really good tale here whilst still being trendy and engaging...perhaps even a little steam-punk. The dinner party, the educated sceptics, the presentation of the machine - have been omitted entirely. Replacing it is a done-to-death tale of lost love, which is presented as the reason for the time traveller's invention, because apparently science needs a feminine muse and invention for invention's sake is not enough.Speaking of love, if you were hoping to see how the nuanced, innocent, paternalistic and vaguely uncomfortable relationship between the time traveller and Weena was handled, this simply isn't there either. The Eloi aren't as you might remember them, and the female lead is far from naive and child-like - she's a teacher. You don't need to be a linguist to want to start pounding your head against the screen when she begins speaking perfect English after a mere 800,000 years.It doesn't get any better after that. Cue heavy use of CGI and scary creatures that might as well be LOTR orcs (yawn), another bad dude and a big and poorly explained explosion. Big dumb happy ending, none of the reflective scenes from the end of the book. The addition of the holographic librarian is welcome and adds a sense of continuity and comic relief that this film so desperately needs.If you're not a reader, you may get something out of this film. There are worse in its genre. To understand why I'm SO disappointed, you really have to be familiar with Wells' work. He was a thinker, a visionary, a man of big ideas. His work is philosophical, but Wells takes the role of the observer as he postulates his ideas - he doesn't pause to moralise. This film does the opposite - no room for free thought is left with the viewer; the protagonist rushes in in shining armour so that you may go home comfortable.I had high hopes for this film, given that the great grandson of the book's author was involved in directing it. I'm left wondering if he's even read the original text. Oh, Simon, in a few short generations you have become an entirely different creature from your grandfather. How positively ELOI of you! You could say Wells foresaw this, in his lesser known work "A Story of the Days to Come".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Actor Nominee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone needs to explain to Guy Pearce that you do not need to spend the entire movie staring off into space with your mouth open. They also might mention that looking like a dead fish in the supermarket does not display nearly as much emotion as he seems to think it does. Based on his performance, he should play a part in a different H. G. Wells classic, "The Invisible Man." As the invisible man. This way, we won't have to watch him try to act. Still, not one line was delivered well throughout the whole movie, so that may not help. The director failed to watch his actor. Still, the effects are decent for the most part. There are the usual inconsistencies in the science that you find in H. G. Wells (or any 19th Century Sci-Fi author). The changes to the script to bring it up to date were stupid, and you could have cut at least an hour out of the movie and made it decent. All the stars this movie has are for the portrayal of the Morlochs. They were very frightening, but everything else was bad.</fullReview>

Throwing CGI at this didn't make any improvement on the previous version.The cast are wasted, and the styling is half-baked, the special effects are no better than a modern TV sci-fi series, and often worse, the nods to the original are only there for people who have seen it, and I guarantee not one of those people consider this a worthy use of 96 minutes of their life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My how time flies when you're making movies. In the 1960's Puppettoon Director George Pal assembled a great and memorable cast which included Rod Taylor, Alan Young and Yvette Mimieux. From it's inception, the film resonated with audiences everywhere and was a definite Classic. In 2002, Simon Wells (The great-Grandson of H.G.Wells) decided on a re-make of the original. In this updated version we are given Guy Pearce who plays Alexander Hartdegen, the time traveler, Mark Addy who plays David Filby and includes Alan Young in a brief appearance as a Flower shop keeper. There is little in the way of comparison as few Classics can ever be excelled. Therefore the next best thing is to highlight the new offering. The original had a a beautiful Eloi named Weena, the new one has Samantha Mumba as Mara. Weena had innocence, Mara has intelligence. The original Morlocks were green skin creatures, the new ones resemble the Sphinx edifices of the original. The original time machine was small, compact and comfortable, the new one resembles a " Cappuccino maker. " The visual action in the original was Victorian, romantic and sympathetically dramatic, the new one is bleak, dark and apocalyptic-ally blurred. Jeremy Iron's is as always incredible and masterful. All in all the new version is good, highlighted with visual effects, explosive features and dramatically action oriented. A great film in it's own right and should be seen as just that, . . . a great film. Recommended. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the Book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first read the book The Time machine when I was about ten or eleven. It has a special place in my heart as one of the first 'grown up' Science Fiction books I ever read. I understand things have to change when novels are adapted. Concepts and ideas that look good on the page don't work on the screen and vice versa. I was resigned to their being being changes made to the original. I didn't mind too much that they had moved the location from London to New York, I didn't mind too much that our hero was given a love interest (who dies early on in the film thus giving him the Hollywood motivation to invent the Time Machine to go back and rescue her). I didn't mind too much that the innocent, aimless, childlike and docile Eloi are here depicted as an aware and innovative bunch of bronzed, muscled, tattooed hunter-gatherers (though the fact that some of them spoke flawless American English after 80,000 years did make me snort peanuts), I don't even mind that the Morlocks suddenly had a complex, hivelike social structure (grafted on from Wells' 'The First Men in the Moon') but what I do mind. What I really do mind is the total Hollywood bullshit ending which has the hero jamming a watch into the rapidly spinning components of his time machine, jumping off, out-running a whole bunch of specially bred killer orcs - sorry, 'Morlocks' - and then being pulled to safety (just in time!) to avoid the unnamed, unexplained, and unexpected deux ex machina temporal explosion, light show, special effects bonanza he just created - which wipes out all signs of badness without touching any of the good guys."Dunno how to end the movie, guys! So why don't we just throw a shedload of SFX at the screen and get out while everyone is still going 'Oooooh! shiny!'?" "Sounds good to me, it usually works." The author went on to write 'Star Trek 10' and no-one was surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Failed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the third millennium, special-effects became sufficiently sophisticated to finally bring Wells' tremendous novel(s) to the screen with their full visual, visceral and narrative impact. Yet here again; just like Speiberg and his 'War Of The World' a director thought he knew better than the original and decided to 'screw around'.I'll begin with some praise. The time machine as a vehicle was wonderfully realised. Instead of an 'armchair with a spinning parasol' from the 1950's movie, we had something that was both mechanical in a 19th century fashion, but with an 'optical-visual' update that made it seem wonderfully contrived. The effect was dramatic - a great amalgam of science and fantasy that did HG Wells proud. I particularly liked the telescopic mounting-steps.But then there was the story. The soppy, predictable romances both in present and future might have been concocted by Disney. We had the idealised Eloi community - and far more human-looking than Wells imagined - with a politically-corrected mixed-race heroine yummy-mummy who might have been born next door. That is; if you lived in the 20th/21st centuries. Their idealised circumstances were given emphasis by rather stylistic Polynesian tribal music scores. Everything is apparently sweetness and light - or is it? And, of course, they've had the good sense to carry on speaking English with American accents. As you would after 800,000-odd years. Hmmm.The Eloi are just so nice, it makes their contrast with the Morlocks that much more civilised when the latter finally appear. Moral issues are simplified for the crass modern viewer. Here the Eloi are a sensible, practical self-sufficient people in their own right. And, of course, they're human. Morlocks, by contrast, are hideous, strong, violent carnivorous hunters. Unlike those envisaged by Wells; these Morlocks can come out in daytime, and they possess superhuman strength and agility. There's no ethical dilemma here. Or is there? later we discover that the Morlocks themselves employ a caste system like that of termites. And our time-traveller finds himself introduced to the grand-wizard-Morlock-bloke-thing who is seriously brainy. He can even read minds. Why, it's Jeremy Irons reprising his intellectual bad guy role in such a beautifully-coiffured blonde wig that whatever the Morlocks may lack in table-manners they evidently make up for in hairdressing skills. He has rather disagreeable plans for the yummy-mummy whom he also holds captive. To his credit; he offers to let the time-traveller go - with no strings. But that would mean abandoning the yummy-mummy to a fate worse than death or something, and in true comic-book fashion a hero can never do that.Instead, he sabotages his time-machine, destroying the Morlock enclave, and presumably gets to screw his yummy-mummy into an indefinite Morlock-free future. Though whether he will sire any offspring is a moot biological point; 800,000 years is a long period of gene isolation. Four of my stars go to the machine. The other two are for sundry effects and sets. But the rest? Well; script and plot were complete junk. Acting was 2nd rate. As to Wells' classic novel and idea? All of his imaginative and thought-provoking concepts were jettisoned in the name of a bog-standard hero-saves-hapless-'maiden', romance-against-adversity tale as crass as 'Pearl Harbour' and as predictable as 'Titanic'. Mediocre; worth a single watch, but no substitute for the book.What the hell's wrong with directors these days? With a little more thought, this could have been great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One measure of a good movie is whether it causes you to look for more on the subject. Having read several of HG Wells' novels, I had skipped over "Time Machine." But now I want to read the book, and also review the 1960 film. The early film I can still recall, and I must have had nightmares for weeks being only about 10 years old when I had to escape images of Morlocks.The movie offers for a thinking person a philosophical edge toward speculation of time travel. Being a Star Trek fan, it is easy to get into logical paradoxes regarding time itself.

		<fullReview>Frankly speaking, when I hired the movie I was expecting something much worse. It is a fantasy film, that's all. Not even science-fiction, as even in the story itself the reason why time machines are impossible is explained. So we must consider the film as just an evasion moment. Not a social analysis, as the original novel was. In fact I prefer to think on it as a film "inspired" in the book, as I use to do will most of "adaptation" films. I have been disappointed too often.Strong points: the character's motivation and 3D of some supporting characters of 19th century; special effects (otherwise inexcusable, in this computer era!); the Eloi town; Vox the photonic one.Weak points: lack of tempo at some moments, as well as lack of sense of wonder; 2D of support characters of 800th century; a poorly developed second(ary?) love story (OK, Samantha is cute and he hasn't seen a woman in 800.000 years, is that enough? I don't think so!); Jeremy Irons and the "heroic" (boring) final fight.In summary, a film I enjoyed and I would recommend, although I would not stop my daily life to watch it again on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet with time travel comes the inescapable un-definition of reality: the paradox. Which is seen in The Time Machine, and is one of only two downfalls the movie has.Spoilers.First of all, the graphics are great. I love it while Alexander is traveling through time, seeing progress as it could never have been seen before. I was impressed with how real it all looks, even though it is going so fast. The clarity of everything in those spans of time makes the movie much more understandable and beautiful.I really love the plot. Alexander Hartdegen loses a loved on and goes back in time to save her. Yet he finds he cannot save her, so he goes into the future to find an answer. His travels take him to VOX, a computer version of Orlando Jones who is extremely intelligent and has a snappy attitude, and the crash landing of the moon. That moon looks really cool, even in a scene later in the movie in which fragments are still floating in orbit around Earth. Alexander eventually finds himself in the year 800,000, where mankind has split into two groups.However, this conflict between the Morlocks and the Eloi (much like the Moiety in Riven) is way too short. Thus being the second downfall of the movie. The time traveling aspect of it is extremely interesting, not just to think about, but to watch. Yet that is not enough to keep me fully satisfied. The conflict is great, but too short.I really like the music (in fact, the day I wrote this is the day I bought the soundtrack). Klaus Badelt is paving a road that is extraordinary. He gives some excellent melodic themes for Alexander as well as a theme for time travel itself. The Morlocks' drum-beats are reminiscent of John Williams' The Lost World score, which I really love.The Morlocks could be better, too. They are mostly puppets, which is kind of a disappointment since it is so easily recognizable. But they are freaky enemies, good enough for the show.Guy Pearce is one great actor. I really like his performance in this movie, as the intelligent scholar, ambitious yet nervous, who is in love with a beautiful woman who gets caught up in unexplainable events. He really portrays Alexander well. The other actors do good, too, but not as great as Pearce.Combining drastically beautiful scenery, great graphics, an excellent score and a great set of actors, The Time Machine is a really good movie. I recommend it to anyone who likes the sci-fi genre.</fullReview>

But that all gets overshadowed by a severe bunch of stupid parts -to call them plotholes would be an understatement-that I only recommend seeing if you are in a plane for a long time and have about 4 glasses of wine in you.*** SPOILER&lt;Back to the Future&gt; may not offer cutting-edge insight to engineers, but it did for me when I first saw it. One of those insights is that, if you travel into the past, there are 2 you's, depending on whether or not you were born. In this case, the professor is reliving a past event...where in there did it show him dealing with his other self? What would have been intelligent AND just as effective would be the time traveler to try and fight the guy behind the bushes..you know the *bad guy...but, no.Oh, well. There's always the 1959 version to watch, and besides the monsters' blue make-up, it aint bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read the original Time Machine [okay, just the abridged version but hey, I'm pretty sure it stuck close to the original] I ignored the critics' warning of the movie and went to see it anyway. My conclusion is that if I hadn't read the book, I would have loved the movie [I'm easily pleased] but since I have - I was pretty disappointed and kept screaming "That wasn't in the book!" at the screen. Usually, in most film adaptations, parts of the book are cut out to shorten it.In "The Time Machine", the opposite happens - most of the movie wasn't actually in the book, so that the only thing retained was the very loose plot. For example, the main hero had no name and was just called "The Time Traveller". He also had no fiancee. The Eloi were completed change - instead of being short, pale, blond looking people, they resembled some kind of African tribe, with Samantha Mumba's character being the unofficial leader [also managing to get her brother a part too]. Another important point that I could understand was ignored was that none of the Eloi could speak English. Also, in the book they were child-like, and lived in ruins [not demolished by a meteor shower as invented for the movie] because mankind had grown weak due to the lack of war, famine and disease, and only the arts had survived.However, those were only minor changes which didn't really matter so much. The change I found the most ridiculous was the addition of Jeremy Irons' character, the "telepathic" Morlock which I just found pointless and made him look like some kind of albino drag queen. Him being pathetic, was enough to make me scream "Tack-o-rama!"However, some additions were good - I enjoyed the part with Orlando Jones as the holographic librarian, and a glimpse of the world in the future. However [this is my favorite word!] I thought that ending was a little hard to understand for those who had not read the book and know that by travelling through time, you do not actually physically move - therefore Alex's time machine located 800,000 years into the future would be in exactly the same place as it was to start with.In all, I did think that this was a pretty good film, with the usual mind-blowing effects and all. But I found it just too short, so that a few of the book's elements [i.e. the dinner party] could have been included. The only thing that really puzzled me was why didn't they keep to the original storyline?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 30 minutes of this movie are good. The time machine, nice special effects, a cause for our hero....and all that. Then the movie rapidly takes in water and sinks. The Morlocks and Eloi are presented in due order along with a talking computer that seemed to have survived for 800,000 years? The end degenerates into an incomprehensible blizzard of events, where the Morlocks are all blown up by the skilfull rigging up of the time machine, which I cannot faintly understand. The Morlocks look like they have rubber masks on and unnecessarily aggresive.The movie misses a number of promising plot branches, like the destruction of the moon and its effect on earth. Instead it gives a vague and incomprehensible fare and a rushed ending as though the producers have run out of ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another remake that wasn't worth the time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it was directed by Simon Wells, who did his Grandfathers great novel a great disservice. The story was contrived and I never got to the point where I cared about the characters at all. It had great effects, but was a souless machination of a film. It used a corny contrived idea, that of the fiancee (who isn't in the novel) who gets killed as an impetus for Alex to create the machine. This can't work. Since a death was the impetus, then why would he create it if she never dies? This was one of the many plotholes large enough to fly a time machine through that ruined this film for me. Also the Eloi were not builders, they were pampered cattle who existed only as food for the Morlocks. The Morlocks were a subterranean race that couldn't come above ground. These Morlocks are running about in broad daylight, so why did they freaking live underground? Guy Pearce walks around as if in a daze through most of the film, not even evoking the simplest emotions for the most. And what was wrong with the name Weena? Was the unoriginal Mara that much better? Jeremy Irons is wasted as an Uber Morlock since having the character was only for Alex to have a foil, as if the entire Morlock species wasn't enough of one! If you haven't seen this mess yet, don't waste your time. Wait for cable or rental. It isn't worth the price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made me physically sick. Obviously Simon Wells knows nothing about the book, yet alone George Pal's version. Why would someone do this?The hook for the movie is his girlfriend dying. Don't worry, I didn't ruin the already piece of Sh*t movie. I didn't care she died. I don't think anyone did. He's a New Yorker in this movie. He has an English accent, which is understandable, but, wasn't he supposed to be from England? If Morlocks are scared of fire, why do they use it in their layer? Aren't they night dwellers? I thought Eloi's were the lazy group of people who's only fear was Morlocks? In this movie, they didn't seem lazy at all. I thought Guy's character was supposed to be upset how the human race turned out? If Orlando Jones was a computer, full of knowledge, how come the Eloi's were so confused about the past? Why didn't they learn from him? Who the hell was Jeremy Irons supposed to be? I have never seen so many contradictions in a movie. I'm not even going to get into the whole controlling dreams crap, or the ridiculously stupid climax. I'm not going to ruin the improbable, boring, ending. I can enjoy science fiction, however, I like it when it at least tries to make sense. Even Doc Brown would be p***ed. Great Scott! This is a load of Sh*t!See the original. Read the book. I don't blame the actors for doing this big budget movie, I would if I got paid millions. I wish I invented a time machine to stop this movie from ever being made.

Although the story ranges from unintentionally humorous, to unimportant, to ultimately non-sensical, the visuals are so nice that, initially, they alone kept me interested. Once we arrive some 800,000 years into the future, however, the captivating quality of the visuals begins abruptly to diminish, while we are forced to pay attention to its convoluted and superficial plot. I'm not the type of person who looks for inconsistencies or plot holes in movies, but in this case, there's such a blatant disregard for motive and common sense that such errors became so obvious I eventually lost all interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The start of this movie simply tries too hard. Alexander (played by Guy Pearce) is setup to be an absent minded professor. To emphasise that he's both learned and special, the movie spends the first 10-15 minutes bludgeoning you with inventions and references (such as Alex's correspondence with Einstein, ignoring the fact Einstein was still in Zurich university in 1899 and wouldn't become a patent clerk until 1902).* Spoiler bits * Then the hero's love interest dies, and he spends years obsessing over her. Naturally, the time machine comes out of this. After that we get some nice special effects, and meet Orlando Jones, and then are flung into the far future. The far future, though, seems to be in danger. Alexander forgets immediately his private quest to save his fiance which has driven him for 4 years, and settles in to do some hero work. The only problem is that, being a time machine movie, Alex avoids the most obvious solution to the problem of the far future -- changing the near future.* End spoiler bits *A short, average hollywood movie with a larger than average plot-hole and reality-inconsistency ratio. It's good for the special effects and Orlando Jones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a unique experience into a world of mass destruction. A fact quickly found that you can not change the past, but only the future. This climax is a bit much as we jump 800,000 years into the future. Overall good casting by Guy Pearce and Jeremy Irons, but a dense aspect of love, which I normally don't dig in movies. But how can Alexander (Pearce)fall in love 800,000 years later after only moments of his fiance's death. A bit cheesy at parts but all together a good time messing with time itself. Prediction of time travel movies: Sadly, this will be our only good time travel movie until Minority Report and The Matrix: Reloaded...not Clockstoppers.</fullReview>

Science fiction movies are my cup of tea and I was kind of looking forward to this one despite the negativity surrounding it. I was surprised it wasn't dumbed down and they took time out to answer the What If? question for this audience. That was a really cool part and made for some nice discussion on the way home. Some remakes are horrible, i.e; Psycho, The Blob, Island of Dr. Moreau, etc but I would never put THIS MOVIE in that category, ever.

		<fullReview>I was thoroughly entertained when I saw this movie. Some of the scenes (especially during the New York time) were very emotional for me. This movie had nary a dull moment and I appreciated it for what it was instead of wishing it was like the book or the 1960 version (personally I didn't enjoy the Pal version as much as some sci fi geeks did, but that's me, everybody's different). Guy Pearce threw himself into this role and gave it all he has as usual. The man really works to entertain. Samantha Mumba did well in her first outing! You go, girl! I like Sienna Guillory too. Simon Wells put forth a good effort with this movie and I want to give him credit. There were some scenes you could tell had been cut but overall the movie zipped by them and you found yourself hit with another beautiful visual effect again before you really missed the scene. The moon scene was totally beautiful. Whoever did that should get a lot of credit, it was awesome!What worked for me was the emotional story of it, how he tried to change the past and discovered he couldn't yet he was able to see that the future could still hold a beautiful promise for him. A very good message and lesson for all of us. Stop wishing for what you can't change and make the best of where you are. For that reason alone I would love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Time Machine, without giving away spoilers, had what I thought it had, which is to say that I thought it had a story that pretty much centered on time travel, fantastic special effects, and a likable character by Guy Pearce. Correct on all counts, The Time Machine far from disappointed me. Guy Pearce gives a terrific performance as Dr. Hartdegen (my one complaint about the film is that the book had no name for the traveller while that movie does, and Samantha Mumba dazzles me with her appearance as well as her abilty to actually act (how many pop princesses really can? Moore? Spears? Prince?). Jeremy Irons short role as the head morlock is short but sweet. It can be noted that the eroding rocks look magnificent and sell the movie to many, because I know it did me. One small complaint besides the named traveller would be that Simon Wells (relative of the great H.G. Wells), an experienced director of animated film, made The Time Machine so short. But given that most animated film is short, I chalk that up to him being able to tell a story in a more cliffsnotes-esque way. By no means best picture of 2002, but by no means a waste of time. I recommend one viewing just to see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, that was a waste of time. Having finally got to see the Guy Pearce version of The Time Machine I can honestly say I wish I hadn't bothered. The Rod Taylor original didn't follow the book totally but this one just seemed to throw the book in the bin. Instead of a man tired of the inevitability of war we have a 'hero' who is obsessed by his failure to save his girlfriend from dying. Having travelled into the past several times to try and save her he now decides to travel to the future where he finds the beautiful Eloi menaced by the dreadful Morlocks and that's where the similarities end. For a film that was made 42 years after its illustrious predecessor, it seems even less scientifically accurate. If the Moon had broken up lie was shown in the book, it would have exceeded Roche's limit and most probably hit the Earth with catastrophic effects. The Morloks were shown to be mindless beasts ruled by a man who wouldn't have been out of place in a Die Hard movie. Jeremy Irons should have been ashamed to appear in this film. Just how was the Uber Morlock supposed to have come into being? I won't even dwell upon the overt racism in this film but just suppose they had done it the other way? Put all that together with Pearce's totally characterless performance and this film is nothing more than a sombre mess. The only saving grace was Samantha Mumba who at least tried to inject some humanity into her role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Time Machine" from DreamWorks and Warner Brothers. A poorly handled story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of me would of liked to have rated this film below a 5, despite some great cinematography and special effects/CGI. There were a lot of plot-line and story-line problems, I suppose that comes with trying to squeeze a book into an 1 to 2 hour movie.Things that didn't work for me in this film:1. Details of how the time machine is created are lacking and rushed through and lacked anything to build believably that such a time machine could have been built in that era of time .2. A missing element and question on my mind while watching this movie was, "How was the time machine powered?" Obviously it was pre-atomic, yet the machine made multiple time jumps and extended length journeys. I think this was a big failure, considering the movie followed in the footsteps of the wonderful movie, "Back to the future" and others. That is one key element that Back to the future included that made it more believable.3. The story jumped over to many time periods for a single film. The way that these accidental events occurred were weak. First going back a few years in time to try to save the woman he loves who died. Then into modern future, and jumping yet again 300,000 years into the distant future. It was an interesting idea, it just didn't work to well. We see the world being destroyed as the moon dies, then jump way into the future as the earth regenerates with the birthing of an entirely new humanity and mutant species without any explanation of how that occurs.Did they evolve? Were there survivors from the old earth? And how is it that there is moonlight in this vast future, if the moon was destroyed in the past?4. The "What If" question that was supposed to be answered in the future and was carrying the movie, didn't feel resolved at the end.5. Seemed very unbelievable that this incredible time machine had to sit in one location. Obviously it was not bound or limited by a stationary power source, it apparently had an unlimited supply of power (somehow). It would of been more believable if it had wheels or flight.The mere idea that it could go 300,000 years into the future, stopping in several time periods, and not materialize into some kind of solid matter seemed unlikely. Even in the film, the original house was torn down and replaced with new infrastructure.6. The futuristic tribal humans vs. the mutant genetically bred cannibals was a stretch of the imagination.Closing thoughts: The movie ends with a split screen of the scientists with his new future woman lover after he sacrifices the time machine and decides to stay and live in the future. On the second half of the split screen, his best friend and house keeper walk away together when his best friend offers her a job. No police investigation, no inquiry, no concern that her employer, and his best friend has vanished. Really?Too many questions were opened in this movie and not resolved. It may have been a great box office money maker, but it was a poorly handled story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry, but there isn't much to say about this bland remake of the HG Wells classic. The acting isn't very convincing, the plot itself is rather thin on the ground and you can't help but feel that the whole thing wasn't so much a film but rather an exercise in special effects and such like.About the only redeeming feature is that fact it's that "perfect" length for a Hollywood film. 90 minutes. Once it's all done and dusted, you can't feel as though you've wasted too much time on it.I won't lie - the effects are quite nice but really they're just fancy redoings of what one might see in the classical redoing and this has none of the charm or class that had. It's straight from the cookie-cutter and it shows, in short unless you particularly want to switch your brain off for the better part of 90 minutes, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows everything that is wrong with remakes.The thing is, the 1960 version is perfectly fine as it is. There was no reason to remake it.So what we get is what we see in modern movies, at least ones after Star Wars where they try to shove as much stuff into the screen as you possibly can.Subtley is lost. In the 1960 version, they didn't need to hit yourself over the head with the fact the Morlocks were eating the Eloi. In this one, the hero has to fall into a charnel pit, and swim around in a pool of human bones after finding the butcher's shop and the meat hooks. Oh, wait, we also need to get Jeremy Irons in there to do a bit of exposition... because someone might have missed the point.I do want to say something about the lead actress. While Weena in the 1960 version is a blonde, whiter than white chick, the character of Mara and all the other Eloi are mixed race people. Mara is played by a Irish-Zambian actress who had the right look, but the woman couldn't act. (I mean, it made sense that they would all start breeding out and racial distinctiveness would be lost after a certain time.) Of course, in Wells version, the Eloi were as twisted and different from the narrator as the Morlock were. It was a commentary on class differences of Wells' time leading to evolutionary differences. The working class (Morlocks) would eventually turn on and eat the rich (Eloi).Oh, yeah, action. Lots of action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst act of ancestor-defilement I can imagine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would never have re-watched this atrocity if not for a discussion series I was hosting but....the sacrifices we make. Wells' film has even less to do with his great-grandfather's novel than the 1960 version, in fact changing the whole motivation of the main character so that he can even more readily dispense with any of the philosophizing and social theorizing that has helped to keep the novel still relevant and interesting today.In this film, the setting has been moved from London to New York though it's still the Victorian '90s. Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is a physics professor about to ask for young Emma's (Sienna Guillory) hand in marriage when she is killed by a mugger. In grief, he sets about inventing a time machine so that he can go back and save her. Wouldn't you? Four years later he's ready, but he quickly finds out that he can't change the past, as that would keep him from building the machine and that would be a paradox. Of course, the paradox of his machine appearing 4 years before it was built in his laboratory or the possibility of him running into himself are never dealt with at all, and this sets up the bad action/thriller pattern in place for the rest of the film: throw logic out the window and when something needs to happen just do it and hope the audience won't notice.He quickly decides to go off into the future. No real reason why -- no discussions of mankind becoming noble and true, as there was in the novel -- nope, he just wants to get out of Dodge apparently. After a longish stop in 2030 where he meets a holographic librarian (Orlando Jones) and somehow glosses over the fact that he apparently died in 1903 - the year he left - and a short one in 2037 as he witnesses the moon break up (cue cool digital effects) he is knocked unconscious on his machine and stays in a daze while the world changes around him, until finally awakening in the year 802,701. Given that 36 minutes have passed by now out of the under 85 (leaving off end credits), you know the action's going to have to come fast and furious and the strangeness and wonder - that still excite this lover of the novel - are going to be in short supply.Suffice it to say that he quickly meets the Eloi, the surface people, led (more or less) by Mara (Samantha Mumba) who is the only adult in the tribe to speak English which is learned by all of them as kids but forgotten by most; she's the teacher though and of course remembers it, can speak intelligibly and is able to lead Hartdegen eventually to the ruins of the library where, miraculously, the electronic librarian still works. But wait, there's a cog in the machinery! Alongside the wonderfully mixed-race Eloi (the sole interesting touch in the film) there's a race of dead-white monstrous super-ape-like thingies, the Morlocks, who are faster, stronger, and like to eat Eloi-flesh. The Eloi of course just accept that their old, feeble, and sometimes others just get taken away - despite being reasonably smart and sophisticated in this version (in the novel and the 1960 film the Eloi are quite feeble and it's not at all surprising that they can't or won't fight back). In short order Mara is captured and our hero has to venture down below where he meets the supreme Morlock, an idiotic conception who can read minds, is super-strong and controls the other Morlocks but who of course gets bested rather quickly by the monkey-faced Pearce/Hartdegen. He's played by Jeremy Irons who I will say seems to enjoy these kinds of cheesy things, at least he's having fun making his big paycheck and probably knows it's crap.And here comes the best/worst part: after dispatching the leader by moving his machine forward in time while super-Morlock is hanging on outside of the machine's "sphere of safety" (my words, none of this is ever explained) and aging the Morlock to death in a few seconds, the time traveler comes back, frees Mara, and sets the machine to blow up, which it quickly does, turning all of the Morlocks underground to dust just as the protagonists reach the surface and safety. So, uh, he saves the day by basically blowing up his machine despite not, uh, really possibly knowing what the consequences would be. This, like virtually the whole of the rest of the film, is just thrown at us with no explanation, and now our hero is presumably left to start a new world with the (of course) beautiful and intelligent Mara, having in a few days forgotten all about his past.Pearce is awful, looking like an ugly sad puppy through most of the film and never being remotely convincing as a man of science; Mumba is nice to look at but that's about it. Some of the art direction and sets are kind of cool, but in a very self-conscious way: look, isn't this awesome! Like the Eloi village, a bunch of weird shell-shaped structures on a cliff face that really don't seem feasible or likely. Not that much of anything in the film as a whole seems feasible or likely, for that matter. It's just, rush ahead, and hope nobody notices how stupid it all is. Well, I did.My hopes for future Wells adaptations remain dim, very dim...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read the original H.G. Wells story with much delight and although the first movie took some liberties I pretty much enjoyed that as well. Which cannot be said of this plain dreadful movie.Simon Wells might be related to to H.G., but he should read his books better. I can't believe how many alterings were brought to a perfectly good story. Now why would you want to do that?I won't say too much about the effects (decent), make up (so and so) or acting (nothing special), as you can't really focus on that while watching a movie that is going so bad...Now it's just waiting for a filming of the Bible with a love triangle in the centre...3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****plot spoilers*****I really wanted to like The Time Machine. I have always admired Time Travel movies, especially the original George Pal version of The Time Machine. As It turned out, I didn't dislike this version, but it never did much in the way of drawing me in enough to care about what happens on the screen. I think part of this lies in the beginning of the movie. Guy Pearce wants to go back in time to save his girlfriend from being shot, which is his motivation for building The Time Machine in the first place. Every time he tries to save her though, she still dies but in a different way. While these scenes do well to supply motivation, (and believe me we have nothing against that, as too many characters in too many films never have any motivation) too much time is spent on this part of the story, so that in the long run, it does nothing more than take time away from Alexander's journey to the future. Part of the fun of the original was watching Rod Taylor's trip through time, until he arrived to the point in the future where he met the Eloi and The Morlocks. The only interesting stop in Guy Pearce's journey is where he meets the librarian Vox, which is merely a setup to run into Vox later in the future. I had more fun watching Rod Taylor, crumble disintigrating books in his hands, and spinning gold rings to find out what he wanted to know. Even the Morlocks in the 60's version, with their hokey makeup and grunts and groans were more entertaining than these gophers.I wish we had found out more about the Eloi, before the Morlocks had arrived on the scene. I wish they had come up with something better than having the moon explode to cause all that destruction. I wish the whole journey through time had been more entertaining. I wish Guy Pearce hadn't needed the whole girlfriend bit to motivate him. I wish I could go watch the original Rod Taylor version......wait a minute...I can...I own that one too.....and that's my advice to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible ? just heartless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Victorian scientist Alexander Hartdegen sees his fiancé murdered during a petty robbery, he throws himself into his work while all even his closest friends know is that he is doing nonsense research and physics. Four years later though and Alexander has created his machine ? a time machine ? that he plans to use to return to the fateful night and save his true love. Somehow he cannot do it though and, in despair, he drives himself forward into the future to find progress beyond his wildest dreams. This progress though, comes with costs and risks ? both of which Alexander is very aware of as he moves into a world where mankind has changed beyond all recognition.This film was wildly derided when it came out in the cinemas and I never bothered to go and see it, preferring to let time pass and pick it up for free on television in a few years. That time came recently and I watched a version of HG Wells' Time Machine that is loosely based on the source material. It starts with potential but all too quickly it becomes obvious and surprisingly heartless ? almost making a conscious decision that the effects will be what people come for and that doing a solid job on those will be enough. Sadly that is not the case but, were it, the effects are already superseded and do not look as impressive as they once may have done. With the humanity and the emotion built into the story, the delivery is quite stiff and dull and I found myself surprised by how little interest I had it the story even when I was far into it. Not totally sure where the problems lie with this but script is certainly one of them (some of the dialogue and exposition is terribly clunky) while the overall production did appear effects driven.It is a shame because Guy Pearce frequently offers more from his performance and his potential but the film never really takes him up on it and it leaves him isolated, trying to be a character in a film that would seem to just prefer an action hero. Mumba looks good (if you ignore that at times her face is chimp-like, and no it is not racist to say so) but she cannot act for toffee ? she didn't even run and scream all that convincingly. God knows what about the film made Irons decide to do his poor character but he is not alone as other famous faces such as Bloom and Addey show up.The Time Machine is not the awful film that some say but it is just very heartless and dull. Some of the effects are good and the plot did have potential but the script and design never let this come out, seemingly more interested in visual bang-for-buck than they were about producing an effective and engaging story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film! Below is My thoughts!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watch the Time Machine for only the second time but I appreciated the film much more than I did before! The effects is very good, the acting is good, the sets look very realistic, and the story is fantastic! Guy Pearce was good and I thought Orlando Jones was good. The music is extraordinary. The truth is I cried when this wonderful part was at the end credits. It starts when the credits say about Stan Winston Studios. It was of course in the film when Guy Pearce lost his necklace in the Time Machine. Also it is located on the original score track number six "I don't belong here". It is really an emotional piece of music composed by Hans Zimmer's colleague Klaus Badelt! I really liked this short but epic picture. Great for time traveling movie fans!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:The following is in My opinions and My thoughts.This movie has an important message I believe. To make it short a person should appreciate life even if it isn't a perfect world. A person should look up at the sky and look at the moon and think how beautiful it looks and what ever time it is whether the sky is a twilight, a cloudy, or what ever kind of sky and thank the lord that he/she can look at it. Us people should be very thankful that we have all of the great trees and animals to live together in the same world. The person should make life better for a better future just not for the person but for everyone around the person. We don't know how the future will be in several years or decades or even further. We should start and use ours minds and stop being cocky and thinking we know everything when we really haven't even begun to learn. Think about, We don't know what God and his heaven looks like. Heck, we don't even know all of the species of fish and other life forms in the ocean. Sure we humans have existed for thousands of years but how long have we had our great technology of today such as televisions. video games, and of course electricity. This hasn't been around long at all compared to how long our human race has. We should all appreciate everything and think before we leap. I just think of things that are important and that most that don't care. This is My thoughts! Thank you for reading!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to conclude with some spoilers, so don't read any further if you plan on renting this flick...I love these types of sci-fi movies. I also like renting movies that the critics pan. This is one of those flicks...I started out liking the movie. I liked the old late 1800's set. I liked the special effects of time travel. I like how the main character hopped of the machine a few times on his way to 800,000 years in the future...But what made the movie so bad was the feverish 'rush' to get to the end. Emma dies....that was depressing. Emma dies again...that was depressing again. The main character hops on his machine, ends up in the future. He is taken in by the Elois (sic), there is no character development, the very next day they are attacked by Morlocks, the lead dude goes down, fights the main evil dude, the time machine blows up, somehow the main dude gets to the top of the mountain before everything blows up, he grabs the girls hand and end of movie.Are they going to fall in love? Who knows? Why wouldn't the main dude want to go back to his own time? He had two opportunities. Yet, the makers of this film gave me NO REASON to believe he would actually want to stay there.It would have been cool if he brought the young girl back with him to his time and get her reaction. I dunno...it just wasn't put together very well....it is a bad movie...</fullReview>

UNFORTUNATELY,the time machine was already built before even a clue of micro-orgasmic minuteness was given to explain how in the world was it conceptualized and created by Alexander. i mean, the title is the TIME MACHINE right? THE MOVIE WAS SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN THAT. where was the physics? the math? the logic? the common sense? the profound idea that's supposed to sweep us all in awe for the creation of the machine??? so that was what i was wondering until i was transported to 2030 and then to 9234567 and then to 9700800 and what have you. and then Alexander stumbles upon a stone age recap type tribe after the moon shattered...and he meets this tribe girl...and it becomes WORSE than ever. I CAN"T BELIEVE so much brain went into the staggering special effects, but not one neuron was spent in actually telling the freaking story, and giving tribute to the work of h.g. wells. what was simon thinking? what was the poster designers thinking? this movie is soooo worth throwing in the time machine and transported to unknown infinity. it's so sad, so empty...so cheesy...so stone age. i give it four for the special effects effort. i can't believe how this crappy version got into this film era. bleah....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It lasts too long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one of those movies where it ends after what seems like an eternity (even though it only lasted 90 minutes), you walk out of the cinema and contemplate going up to the cashier and asking for a refund.I haven't read the book, but boy if it's anything like this movie, how in the world did Doc (y'know, Back to the Future 3) impress that cute schoolteacher by talking about this book?For the first half of the movie I thought "The Time Machine" was going to be a good watch. The depiction of England in the 1880s was charming and quaint, Guy Pearce well cast as the absent-minded Alexander; the love interest, Emma, lovable, and her death very tragic. These assumptions were further enforced by the impressive time-travelling effects. The portrayal of fashion changes was particularly witty. But things went downhill from the moment Alex got knocked unconscious and travelled 8,000,000 years into the future. For starters, the Eloi village was suspiciously similar to LoTR's Rivendell, and the resemblance of the Morlocks to the Uruk-hais was all too clear.Mara's acceptance of Alexander is too convenient and illogical. He drops out of a time vortex, 800K years from the past, talks funny, wears weird clothes, is frowned upon by all her friends - and she lets him sleep in her house without a second thought. Alexander, on the other hand, undergoes an amazing transition from a nerdy, forgetful professor to a heroic hunk who risks his life to save someone he just met the day before. Wasn't he supposed to have been hopelessly in love with Emma for the past 5 or more years?The movie doesn't manage to give any satisfactory answer to the question "why can't one change time?". Character development is almost nil for the supporting cast, and the story moves waaay too fast. Hollywood should learn to spend less on special effects and more on developing good scripts and storylines.</fullReview>

The plot was going along (slowly) and it was all of a sudden over. No exciting turning point in the movie, no suspenseful buildup, it just finished.Effects and visuals were good, but this movie proved to me that visuals are not enough to make a good movie. There were so many different ways they could have gone with the plot to make it interesting, but none of the subplots were followed through on - they were just introduced and passed over. It felt to me like they were trying to fit the movie in a designated time slot, so they had to cut out all the good parts. From someone who likes 90% of the movies he sees, I give this one a 3 of 10.</fullReview>

He's had his moments (L.A. Confidential, Memento) but here he's insufferable. The plot's deviations from the original story turn one of the more prophetic science fiction novels of its age into a ludicrous muppet show that resembles 80's-era Sci-Fi clunkers like 'The Beastmaster' and 'Conan the Barbarian.' With the exception of Pearce (a smug jerk, but a pretty good actor), the performances are atrocious. It's a real shame, because the potential was there for a superb sci-fi saga.

Loping around like an anxious primate Mr Pearce was presumably meant to represent an absent minded professor but to me he resembled nothing more than Jerry Lewis's Nutty Professor. Whilst Mr Rod Taylor in the 1960 version could only go forward in time,Mr Pearce goes back in time at first to prevent the murder of his fiancée.Having failed in this he virtually commits "suicide by Time Machine" and shoots forward to the unimaginable future.Here he falls in love with a lady of the ill - used Eloi and comes up against the Morlocks who may have improved in appearance but have not improved in habits. Certainy the Special Effects are a far better than in the original,but despite all the whistles and bells "The Time Machine" still fails to realise on the screen. Perhaps,like the work of Mr Ray Bradbury,the writings of a genius like Wells cannot be adequately imagined except in the mind of the reader. There are some nice visual jokes scattered round the laboratory but,diverting as they may be,they hardly make up for the pedestrian - like plod of the movie as a whole I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... because director Simon Wells didn't have to travel back in time to ruin his great- grandfather's story: he just had to make this movie.The Time Machine can be judged on two levels.As a typical science-fiction adventure it's passable, if conventional. Professor Alexander (Guy Pearce) builds a time machine and ends up in a remote future where Earth is populated by two races, friendly Eloi and monstrous Morlocks.As an adaptation, it's silly and worthless: all social subtext has been completely erased. The Eloi are kind, helpful, loyal, environmental-friendly, while the Morlocks are just a bunch of ugly subterranean cannibals. This robs the movie of any deeper meaning than a typical good versus evil struggle.Performances are acceptable, but the characters are so flat they fail to register. Pearce's Alexander is too anodyne to be interesting; Irons' ridiculous Morlock leader appears too late to be truly relevant.Soundtrack and visual effects are remarkable - too bad they were wasted in service of such a banal script.5,5/10</fullReview>

That one gets a 7 out of 10 for being a better film.But I digress. I'll start with saying that on the whole this wasn't a bad film, but it wasn't good either. There was one MAJOR flaw with the story and while I'm not 100% sure it's valid I'll comment on it anyway.When Alex makes his second trip back to Save Emma we don'tsee it but isn't there another Alex who arrives at the park to meet Emma. I would imagine as the newly arrived Alex spirits her away the original Alex of that timeline upon finding sheis not there to meet him goes home somewhat disappointed.Wouldn't that mean he never builds the machine and therefore in that timeline at least he never goes back in time to save Emma unless of course she dies at another time we don't see on camera.Confused yet? I just think I did a marvelous job of confusing myself. And this is only the first 15 to 20 minutes of the whole film. Look on the whole it's not that bad a film but with things like this that you might notice you may feel cheated when you watch it. For my part I did enjoy the film but still maintain a level of fondness for the original one....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've never read the original Wells masterpiece, or if you've only seen the likewise weak translation (but otherwise pretty good film) of the story directed by George Pal in the sixties, then this is a pretty decent film. Although the beginning was a little too cute and contrived, the rest of the film does make up for these shortcomings.However, I *HAVE* read Wells' original, and trying to draw inevitable comparisons do hurt. I was hoping to see a true-to-the-story version of the film with the modern effects that are really needed to make it sparkle. The effects were there, but where was the story?Unfortunately, H.G. Wells' story was quite absent. Some of the names were taken from the original work, but they were applied to beings that simply didn't match up to his vision.I can only hope that the proposed upcoming War of the Worlds will be a better translation - and hope also, since this has been done more than a few times before, someone else will come along with a version that will do justice to a great tale.It is worth watching - as a rental - but don't expect to see the book made a movie here.</fullReview>

Guy Pearce makes a time machine, it only goes forward, the future is screwed up, Orlando Jones is a funny hologram, Jeremy Irons makes a good villain.There are problems. The first half is great - the film is set up very well, and you feel like you're in it for the long haul. Then, the second half isn't really a half at all - more like a half followed by a quarter. The film was far too short, and Jeremy Irons was wasted in a part he was great in. He should have had more time.The effects were great, but is doesn't seem like it would have cost them $80 million. Especiall for such a short film. Sorry, but I just can't get over that.Regardless, rent this. It's better than most of what's out there now, and Guy Pearce is very convincing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slow, boring, confusing wreck of a movie. The only good things about it are the Time Machine itself (it's beautiful) and Jeremy Irons. The music is awful -- distracts from the movie instead of enhancing it. Guy Pearce acts more like a moron than a nerd -- what a ham. There were errors (no women students at Columbia in 1899, for example). The book was so wonderful you'd think it would be difficult to wreck the movie, but the director proved it could be done. I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. It was more of a cartoon than anything else -- maybe the kiddies would like it. The deleted scene explained a lot and the movie suffered because of the deletion. Plus the set-up was way, way too long. Don't waste your time paying to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I certainly believe that Simon Wells deserves an "A" for effort with his "Time Machine".It's very difficult for me to make too many critical comments on a movie like this, and for two good reasons: (1) Being an animator myself, I can relate to the fact that Simon Wells will have some technical difficulties here and there with this project since it is his first attempt at a live action film (he ordinarily specializes in animated features--previous credits include "The Prince of Egypt" and "Balto").(2) I was impressed by the fact that Wells is the great-grandson of H. G. Wells himself, which is what brought interest in me to what would otherwise be a sort of "ho hum, I'm not exactly rushing to the local theatre" affair.But honestly, the movie isn't *that* bad, certainly not as lousy as a lot of other attempts of this sort I could mention from my various peers in the industry. Actually, it has no more "first time making a film" errors than, say, Barbra Streisand's enjoyable "Yentl", which also had some of the same errors we see here in terms of some flat deliveries here and there and the like (and even in some of Walt Disney's earliest live action flicks as well).And speaking of Disney, this movie isn't one that's attempting to stay "up to date", if that makes any sense: in fact, with its lovely soundtrack and gentle-in-comparison-to-other-films-these-days approach, it appears to be emphasizing the same Hollywood innocence and sweetness not seen since the likes of George Pal's original adaptation. A lot of the emphasis here is on the visuals while the script can sort of clunk along at times, but that's alright. This one clearly isn't trying to impress: it's a highly personal attempt. Wells is trying to make the sort of movie that his great-grandfather would have enjoyed, and that's only right and natural.It's not the greatest flick I've seen in ages, but I'm still happy I saw it. Like "Dragonheart", it's content to simply be fun without attempting to wow me at every attempt, and I like that.Oh yes, and one other thing I wish to mention. During the gorgeous time-travelling sequences, combined with their lovely accompanying musical score, I couldn't help feeling particularly touched by the overall presentation as a tribute to a relation. While watching fields, trees, ages and everything else evolve with such breakneck speed in scenes which are played not for excitement but for dramatic reasons with a genuinely haunting visual poetry and beauty, I couldn't help thinking to myself, "Even if it did or didn't become quite what might have been envisioned, H. G. Wells would nevertheless have enjoyed the fact that Simon tried... he would have been proud."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The time machine is one of the most famous and remembered books from his author H.G. Wells, the novel in fact had aprevious cinema version so Hollywood couldn't resisted to made a new version directed no more, no less by Simon Wells great grand-child of H.G. Wells.Unfortunately the result is a movie full of incoherences, excessive, bad solved situations, poor final explanations and in general a very bad script, 800,000 years to the future ,come on, give me a break.Basically in a few words the scientist Alexander Hartdegen a visionary man for his time, a New York from two centuries ago, when he lost a lovely being, unroll by MAGIC a machine which he can win to the death, but when he couldn't, he decided to travel to the long, distant future, looking for the answer of Why he could not change the past? and there he discovers an awful, macabre true.Guy Pears appears very tired and extremely thin and emaciated, Jeremy Irons is wasted and over reacting in his few role of an intelligent leader of a future underground post apocalyptic world the Uber-Morlock, Orlando Jones made his SHOW as Vox, and Samantha Mumba gave me sleeps, however Mark Addy is OK in his role of David Philby, the Alex only friend and the young and so pretty revelation Siema Guillory is a girl with abrillant future.Is anything good to share of this very poor adaptation? SURE, the soundtrack is amazing, the visual effects are splendid; specially the travel of the time machine, the makeup is excellent, the photography works, two or three ideas are interesting, a couple of good memorable sequences, where we learn that the much progress will made, the human kind to their perdition will go.A big achievement in technical aspects,and a poor movie clumsy written..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on R1 DVD 96 min.For a movie that cost 15 times that of Memento, The Time Machine is a bit of a disappointment. All the money seems to have been spent on a victorian gentlemans chair and some plastic.Irons over acts with enjoyable results and Guillory makes a brief but convincing appearance as the Professors loved one. It's the casting of Guy Pearce as the star that is most questionable, Guy is a fine actor but he is too serious for such a shallow movie, Krusty would have been a better choice.On the plus side the movie is visually stunning, the machine, the travel sequences and the photonic librarian are all good. Not so good are the Morlocks and the underground scenes.A curiosity, at one point Irons [chief Morlock] while speaking to Pearce says "I am the inescapable result of you" suggesting that somehow the Professors jaunts were in some way responsible for the evolution of the Morlocks. Alas this, and all other interesting avenues of enquiry, are left unexplored.5/10 average, 6/10 for true gizmo buffs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes a heck of a movie to get entire theaters to roar with laughter when an innocent young woman gets run over by a stagecoach, and this is that movie. It takes a heck of a screenwriter to write in a beautiful, young woman, the ideal of love across time and space and think, "Okay, so, their love is eternal, and he's come across the very fabric of reality for her, and they're staring adoringly at one another; it's about time she got knocked out of frame by a team of horses." It takes a heck of a director to shoot the scene where the man looks back at the woman with cathartic contentment and say, in the editing room, "Okay, great. That's the look of love and devotion I want, to drive him to do the impossible . . . now . . . cut it . . . there! Make it look like the buggy hits her like Lawrence Taylor after some crack! Excellent."This movie offers all this and more. It has a woman in a full-length dress, corset, and bustle being run over by a stagecoach in a comically brutal fashion, and then it has a fairly poor science fiction movie. Pretty good, ya? In conclusion, if you're a fan of brutal stagecoach blindsidings, where the driver doesn't flinch, the horses don't slow down, and the woman doesn't even see the one that gets her, this is the movie for you! I give it ten out of ten hoofprints!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched The Time Machine, I kept thinking over and over again, "Good grief, what was it all those people found to HATE in this movie?"Like many I suppose, though I'd been inclined to see it in a theater, I was persuaded by the choruses of howls from all about saying what a terrible movie it was. I didn't go. Only now have I gotten around to renting the DVD.Maybe lowered expectations played a role, but basically I enjoyed it from start to finish. No, it wasn't "Fellowship of the Ring" or "The Quiet Man," but it wasn't "Nightfall" or "Slipstream" or "The Four Seasons," either.In fact, from the start, I liked the characters, felt interested in them, was involved in the lead character's quest, enjoyed the sets and the effects and the music... it was a story that was going somewhere, going there well, and taking me with it. I was involved, interested, entertained -- what more do I want out of a movie?The effects didn't overwhelm the movie (as in "The Phantom Menace"), but they were striking. The images of the Moon stay in my mind. And, much as "The Fellowship of the Ring" is my favorite movie of all time, the image of the Eloi's cliff dwellings lingers more evocatively than Lothlorien.Hate me if you must, but not only did I not hate this movie, I enjoyed it and would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where didn't the film fail?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly we sometimes witness big-budget films turn out to be a mess from beginning to end. I don't mind so much brain dead, big-budget, Hollywood factory films, as long as they are entertaining, or action packed or funny. I've learned to enjoy those sorts of films, not expecting some ?Schindler's list' every time I go to the movies. However, with all the wonderful material, the fountain of possibilities and the broad spectrum of the story The Time Machine, nothing becomes of the film. Yes, I thought the CGI was well done, and captured the time travel pretty well, but that's it. Everything else is horrible. We have major turning points in the film which last for seconds, while minor scenes are dragged out. The motives behind everyone's actions are un-realistic. Characters don't catch our sympathy at any point, and when anything is becoming interesting we cut to something else ? leaving what ever was left behind hanging without any further development. Two of the biggest failure I feel was to leave the story so simple. The director should give more credit to his audience and fill the film with complicated and challenging material. Just think about it, Star Trek raises more interesting questions about time travels in 45min episodes, than this film does. The other irritating factor was the horrible look of Guy Pearce. He looked like he had been on speed (amphetamine) for several weeks, or that he was anorexic. This look served him well in Momento, but here he just looks constantly sick. In general the film should have been more challenging, longer, and with another lead actor! 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See this version first, before you read the book, before you see the 1960 version because, by itself, it's a good story, but deviates so far from the book, I wonder that they dared stick H.G.Wells' name on it. Still, I must admit that Wells' Time Machine was written for the late 19th century, and doesn't really translate well to a movie that pleases a modern, violence-loving audience(no offense to anyone intended; i know that not everyone, including myself, likes violence). In that respect, it was a good modernization with some nice touches. It captures the spirit of the book, which is that we have the ability to destroy ourselves and even make ourselves inhuman and bestial. It's vastly different from any other version but, as I said before, it stands nicely on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A profanation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This kind of contains spoilers) I still can't believe this movie was directed by a descendant of H.G. Wells. It's a trivialization of everything the book was about. It's nothing more than a cheap "knock-off", spasmodically borrowing elements from the book that would make for a "great Hollywood thrill-ride." The novel was, above all, social commentary. Aside from its entertainment value as a great story, it theorized on the future of mankind, and in fact the entire planet, considering our current path of progression (which holds as true now as it did at the end of the 19th century). It was a very well told narrative, but for those who wanted more it also offered a deeper insight into the nature of man as well as social, economic and political structures. But here, everything is reduced to the banal concepts of Hollywood movies. There're the good guys and the bad guys, and the good guys triumph over the bad guys because the latter are very very bad. Both races retain next to nothing from the book. The Eloi are no different from humans who are simply rebuilding civilization, giving the viewer no pause in immediately identifying with them and labeling them as the unquestionable good guys. The Morlocks, having been deprived of their machinery, any semblance of intelligence, and even their free will, are nothing more than savage cannibalistic monsters - the obvious bad guys. And so the Time Traveller comes along and destroys all the bad guys. In the book, he was a true scientist - objective, analytical and motivated by necessity. In the movie, he's your typical one-dimensional hero in Victorian clothing. The premise of finding out why one can't change the past was just a sad attempt at making the movie seem deeper than it really was. The presence of the "final boss", imaginatively called the Uber-Morlock, only worked to further cheapen the movie. Like the Time Traveller said: "There must be a leader." Why? Because the climax of every "great Hollywood thrill-ride" calls for one. It was the single worst deviation from the novel, and though it could have been effective were it done right, it only served to push the Morlocks further into the evil extreme, in case anyone had any doubts. The presence of an "evil intelligence" behind the "monsters" negated everything the Morlocks were in the novel. At this point, why even bother calling them Morlocks? The same, of course, applies to the Eloi who resemble their literary counterparts only in name. I won't even mention the absurdity of the library guy. I wouldn't have nearly as many complaints had the movie not masqueraded as an adaptation of the novel. As such, it is simply a travesty and a profanation of a science fiction masterpiece.</fullReview>

The acting is passable and the plot is not overly taxing, a man invents a time machine to try and return to the moment his girlfriend dies to try and save her. Along the way he ends up in the extreme future where there are 2 types of humans, the good guys on the land and the baddies under it. The baddies herd the good guys and take the hero's new girlfriend! damn. so off he goes to find her and ends up finding his meaning in life.

Not only was I surprised that I liked the movie but also that it didn't contain ANY bad language and only a slight nudity (if you can put the girls outfit in that vain). Nothing too objectionable.The leading man (Pearce) I thought was kind of a dud at first just the same way I thought Antonio Banderas wouldn't be a good Zorro - until he made the transformation. The same goes for Pearce. I couldn't see him as a leading man until he made the transformation from the nerd that he was earlier. This is to the movies' credit.I liked the way the film kept much of the original movie's style but I also liked the changes hat were made. I especially found interesting the part about why Alexander Hartdegen couldn't change the past. It made sense and was sort of the "hook" of the film. I had to go back to the explanation twice in order to understand it though.Also in the area of changes that I liked were the Eloi who had some life to them. They just didn't go off to die willingly. The moon thing was cool too. I enjoyed seeing the original `Mr. Philby' in this movie as well.This is a short review as `TheShape23' did a better job reviewing this picture than have I. Same conclusion tho.This DVD will be added to my collection, as it deserves to be there. It is a very good action film without the unneeded "crap" the gets into other movies.

In many of the earlier scenes, the professor is caught in a profile shot and, with his scrubby beard and jutting jaw line, seriously looks like a Neanderthal! Excellent irony!This movie many have not done well at the box office because folks these days are not as well read. They seem to have been expecting some great NEW story, not realising that the film is based on a story that is just a tad over 100 years old (first written by H.G.Wells in 1895), though this time through it has an interesting twist on things. Instead of building a time machine to prove a mathematical point (that time is just like space) the effort is spurred on by a need to 'fix' the past.. to recover a lost love.Unfortunately even THIS effort isn't handled very well. After saving her life once, only to lose her in a slightly different way, he gives up! If he were really so obsessed as to spend over four years building this thing, why would he quit after ONE failure?Other than this new twist, the film differs from the book in that there is no return to the 'present' time. His philosophical bent on the search for science drives him to return, to present his arguments, to try to convince fellow scientists and contemporary thinkers, yet in the end realises that it is only HE that understands, and so, looking for further knowledge, heads out.. apparently to never return, though always in control.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unintentionally faithful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2002 version of Time Machine is remarkably faithful to the 1960 original. First off both the films are fun, if mindless pieces of Saturday matinee fare. You know, eye-candy special effects, a few gross bits, a little romance - i.e. something that goes perfectly with sticky floors, greasy popcorn and the girl in the tight sweater.However, what is really interesting are the differences. Even more striking than the obvious technological advances in special effects are the how films reflect the attitudes of the time . In the 60's version, Rod Taylor is incredibly self-assured (to the point of being an idiot), almost evangelistic. It doesn't take great insight to see the anti-Red undertones or how that missionary zeal would soon lead to Vietnam. In contrast, Guy Pearce completely sleepwalks through his role (seems like he still thinks he's in Memento...) and his aim is not to change the world but is personal - a familiar Private Ryanization. The calamities in both films are also very revealing. In the 60s cold-war version, it is of atomic satellites and nuclear war. In the post-Soviet version, we know longer fear the bomb directly but still fear how technology might hurt us through environmental catastrophe. Finally, the addition of the Jeremy Irons character in the present version reveals how much of a leadership cult our society has become. Leaders are all that matter now, not the people who implement the fiats. Bill Gates and Saddam Hussein are worshiped and reviled in contrast to the 60's where the cadre of talented engineers at Chrysler or the people in the evil Communist empire would have been credited/blamed.It would be interesting to see what the remake 40 years from now would look like.</fullReview>

I saw this newest version of The Time Machine and was absolutely impressed by the special effects, but if it weren't for the special effects, there would be absolutely no reason to see this movie. Poor direction, lame acting (surprisingly from Guy Pearce whom I really thought was great in L.A. Confidential and the fantastic Memento), a poor script and just plain silly ideas get in the way of making this a movie to see. 800,000 years into the future and he runs into a number of people that still speak English? Give me a break. Enjoyed Jeremy Irons' performance even if I would not have known it was him unless I had seen the credits.

So he goes into the year 2030 and things look kinda wild and he ends up talking to this holographic lookin dude in a library that talks to him for a while then he ends up going into the future a little more, but only to the year 2037 and sees the world is almost over he sees the buildings burnt down and destroyed and when he ask someone why they said the moon is breaking up and crashing into the Earth, kinda corny but it looked cool. So so far it's good then it gets crappy now he goes 800,000 years into the future, kind of a stretch! So he's knocked out in this machine as time goes by and we see the Earth reforming itself through the ice ages and all that good stuff and he eventually ends up in a weird looking land where people live in what looks like giant sea-shells on the sides of mountains. So this was really stupid and the people who live there most can't speak english but naturally the hot Samantha Mumba can, so they become friends and he has to help save her life in the end from these creatures that come up out of the sand to take these people in and eat them. And towards the end he talks with some spooky lookin dude that babbles on about this land and reading his mind it was really retarded. I wouldn't advise anybody to see this cause you just don't get much in the way of seeing anything cool in the future really and nothing in the past at all! This movie blows. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off good, then gets really bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. I think the original 60's version starring Robert Taylor is a classic movie. With that in mind, I was truly hoping this would be as good if not better. It looked promising for a while. The time transition scenes were handled really well. It's only when the lead character arrives 800,000 years into the future that things go downhill. I know this is a sci-fi movie, but to me that means things should be fantastical or challenging to the mind, not moronic, illogical, and plain stupid. That's what the last half of this movie offers. I won't give away any spoilers, but I literally slumped in my seat from disappointment when we were first introduced to the Eloy and certain "logistical" issues that would exist between a man from 800,000 years ago and the natives of the future-present were fixed with a total lack of imagination or realism. The book is a classic, the original movie was a near-faithful adaptation and a classic in itself, this version should be jettisoned into the timestream never to be seen again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Book, Bad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this is an example of how a movie should not be: the script does not have increasing intensity, it is rather flat and the movie ends when you think the great moments are yet to come.The difference between the book and the movie is that the movie concentrates on special effects and shows a lot of disgusting details instead of showing the philosofical aspect that made the book great. Yes, we have the Eloi-s and the Morloc-s, like in the book, but they are missing the key element: the Eloi are not blonde and beautiful and they ARE WORKING, which contradicts the very essence of the original idea: that the 'upper' race became numb because they already had everything they needed.The movie also wastes some precious part of it's 96 min playtime investigating some other theory about time travel: the possibility of changing the past.To the movie's credit, there are some impressive special effects when depicting the time travel, showing the evolution of the earth over 800,000 years. Unfortunately, it is also the special effects that make the movie bad. I mean, I really didn't need to see all of the ugly things so close-up, I would rather have had more scenes to give a better view of the situation depicted...And, completely out of the sudden, the movie ends. Just like that! At the moment, I surely was not expecting a solution, because the action did not lead me to that expectation.I will not recommend this movie to any of my friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ridiculous farce of a great short story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, I wouldnt waste the time and energy it would take to write a synopsis for such a garbage movie, but the boob above me stimulated some latent force inside of my being which commanded me to sit down and pour my mind onto my computer.Let me get this out of the way: H.G. Wells' The Time Machine is such a fantastic short story, it should have never been introduced into the vampiric world of big-budget pictures. Even if it was to be directed by his son or his grandson or whoever that clown is. The Time Machine, like most books-to-movies, should have stayed as a book so that slobs might just have to pick up a book and READ to find out what happens. But I digress.I'll keep this brief. This is one of the dumbest movies I've seen in a long time, with about 5 minutes of cool eye-candy. It also contains one of the funniest death scenes ever filmed, and the best part is, it wasnt intended to be humorous. When (if) you see this movie, you'll immediately understand what I am talking about. Almost the entire theatre was laughing. The Morlocks looked silly, the Eloi are too human, and the movie left out most of the really neat stuff from the book. As cool as Jeremy Irons is, I hope he got payed a hefty sum to appear in this crap because he is so much better than this. I also hope that Samantha "Mumba" steps in a bear trap, lies crippled for a week, and eventually is forced to chew off her own leg to crawl for help. And Simon Wells isn't much higher on my list of terrible, terrible people. I'm not sure if I would harbor this much distaste had I not read the book beforehand, but I have, so there you go. Steer clear of this drek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, we were hoping for an entertaining movie and for the most part, we got it. Unfortunately, you could see the blatant rush through the plot, thus making this a half-hearted attempt at a great story.There was so much to work with in the way of the special effects, the story, the characters, but the story was chopped for brevity and this had the effect of making the characters rather shallow. The special effects were great, but they alone can't make the movie. Also, the music was dated and that kind of made us feel like it was a second rate job.This was an opportunity missed and we gave it a 5. Watch it to fill some time, but don't expect much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this one. There have not been many sci-fi movies out lately (the only one I can think of Jason X which I will not see) and I hoped this would be able to compete with the fantasy thing we got going on in cinema nowadays. Sadly, this is not to be, but even if it isn't perfect or noteworthy of Oscars, do we have to put it down? It was fun to watch, it had nice special effects, nice cinematography, good acting and a mediocre script. So what if it isn't Lord of the Rings, or Insomnia or Spiderman. It's a story that can draw you in if you let it. I don't know about anyone else, but I was itching to know what would happen next after the guy's girlfriend died, when the Eloi were captured, when the moon started breaking up, etc. I give it a six out of ten. But Jeremy Irons needed a bigger role though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good attempt to update the original 1960 film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very good attempt to bring the story up to date. It also introduced an important element that was sort of lacking in the original story &amp; film - why DID the Traveller build the machine? Watch the film to find out.It was well structured with each little section leading onto the next, it even explained the reason why the Morlocks went underground. This time the Eloi were not simple brain-dead creatures and the Morlocks were not clumsy, light-fearing fat humans. The Morlocks were physically superior to humans (800,000 years of evolution) and the chase sequences are beautifully crafted.I felt that the acting was pretty good with some very familiar faces. It was lovely to see Alan Young, who played Philby in the original film, getting a cameo as the florist. My only gripe was that although Jeremy Irons was excellent as the Uber-Morlock, he didn't get long enough in the film.The sets are out of this world, especially the Eloi's cliff hanging dwellings and the field of rotating 'windmills' was something else. My wife, who isn't a great sci-fi fan, said that the Time Machine itself was awesome and I have to agree. It must have taken weeks to build and was a beautiful piece of craftsmanship - I only hope it is or will end up in a film museum.The special effects are beautiful and well used. The use of lighting when the Time Machine moves is very well done and the sequence where Alexander travels 800,000 years into the future with the changes in geography and such is a wonder to watch. The effect at the beginning of the film where the moon is breaking up looks very realistic. The music is great too, the haunting vocals when you first encounter the Eloi send shivers down your spine.The is also a lot of little throwaways to be spotted in the film, such as references to Star Trek, the original film, Asimov and many more - see if you can spot them all!In summary, this is a nicely crafted film and I'd recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Time Machine Had I been comatose and in need of intravenous film material to sustain my life system, then perhaps this over indulgent celluloid semi-acceptable vehicle may have sufficed. But I am not, Monday to Thursday at least, comatose, nor am I sufficiently lacking in social awareness to ignore the gross and hideous offences committed by this film in the form of racial and ethnic stereotyping. I won't recount the entire `Time Machine' story (for fear that someone may hurl me into a time machine and transport me back to last night and force me to watch it again) lest to sum briefly: bumbling academic Professor invents time travel machine (spurred by traumatic event, leading to his profound existential questioning which could only be answered by travelling to another time), travels forward in time, goes a bit too far, and finds the planet and the human race to have undergone vast evolutionary changes. He encounters two separate races of people, and finds himself embroiled in a battle for survival between the Eloi and the Morlock. Popular interpretations of the evolutionary division of the races in this novel has centred on the analogy of class structure - the 'under-class' which exists to provide for and service the 'over-class' (literally living above the land), and indeed there have been numerous Marxist reconstructions highlighting the ruling class and proletariat analogies. Lets leave that there, for this is neither that time nor the place for such discussion. What does need to be said is that these points are maintained in the film to some recognisable degree, but not to the effect that was created in the original film. One race is being hunted and eaten by the other, and this apparently is the 'way' it is. Enter our 'Great White Hunter', and enter the end of anything resembling sense. The Eloi (above dwellers) are played by actors who would not look out of place on an international fashion catwalk. Every shot of these people in the film consisted of beauty, vanity, and sheer stupid, ignorant bliss. But here is the real catch: it is obvious to anyone watching the film with more than a soupçon of cerebral activity, that this group of humans are obviously of non-white ethnic origin. They might be south Asians, south Americans, Maoris from New Zealand (and strangely they have, over 800 000 years retained body art, but lost the English language), its not clear. Whatever ethnic origin they appear to be, they are characterised by stupidity, fecklessness and ignorance. Until, that is, our fearless professor arrives on the scene. He is the `uberman'. Not only is he intelligent, but also brave and strong, and has a survival instinct. Oh, and he is white. He and he alone can lead this people out of the darkness and into the light of progression and development. Does this sound familiar? It does to me. It sounds rather like the Christian missionary project of the last 1500 years or more, where the 'heathen' dwelling in the darkness of sinful idol worship must be taught the ways of the developed, Christian world. And even if one takes away the religious connotations, one is still left with the implications of the historical legacy of huge and devastating imperial and colonial decimation - both physical and ideological. The covert implications are clear - almost overt actually - it takes a race of morally, physically and intellectually superior people to lead this community of idiots to develop and take further steps on the evolutionary scale. I may be accused of 'racialising' the subject, but in reality, am simply holding up a mirror that reflects the ideological crime already committed. I am shocked and disappointed that what could have turned out to be an insightful venture into class divides, played through the vision of fantasy, turned out to be yet another insult to audiences the world over. When will this stop? I would fear that it is too late to stop, but there are directors and writers in this arena who will find a way out of this stereotyping temptation and it is they who will lead the ignorant into the light of multi-racial awareness. While I would concede that the special effects are 'special', the characterisation is poor. Guy Pearce tries his best as a bumbling professor / unwilling hero, but one never feels any empathy or sympathy for his predicament. Similarly his relationships with his fiancé and friend are empty of feeling and emotion, and unfortunately one couldn't care less what happens to anyone in the film. Whilst it's only the 21st century in our world, a few hundred thousand years off from the Morlock and Eloi, we have our own ideological battles to fight and they are being fought in the arena of film, against a backdrop of big budget finance and profit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Time Machine is visually very good with an impressive setting in Victorian New York and imaginative settings in several futures. The film is very enjoyable and has some great moments but is let down by some poor thinking. E.g. the language spoken 800,000 years into the future is clearly just made up English words spoken with an American accent rather than a new language with a completely new sound.The ending is a rip off of many James Bond films with explosions and the good guys being chased but never caught. The chief baddie played by Jeremy Irons is great fun and supposedly super intelligent but is bothered about trying out the time machine for himself ? what a missed opportunity.Well worth seeing but ignore the holes in the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Swear That There's A Good Film In Here Somewhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's just finding it that's the problem.No, that's not the problem, the problem is that there are several nifty films in here, but none of them have anything to do with the other.Mr. Philby and Mrs. Whatsit (I think that's her name) are fantastic. Their scenes are amongst the best in the film, full of regret, suffering and worry.Then there's the tragedy of Anne and the good Doctor - I found it an interesting touch for the motorised parambulator to appear twice. This comes complete with a mugger straight out of Crime and Punishment.The fears over technology going too far, my favourite background bit (there were many of these, and they were entertaining) must have been the continuity with Lunar Leisure.Vox and the Chief Morlock who appear to be showing the problems of knowing everything. These two are up there with Mr. Philby and the Housekeeper in terms of enjoyment of their scenes. I'd only ever seen Orlando Jones in a comedy, but his scenes as Vox were outstanding, quite funny, but scary as well. The trouble is, the chief Morlock is such an interesting character I don't want to watch the scenes after him. If ever there was a case for giving a character more scenes it was him.Then Mara and the Eloi who are the damsels in distress straight out of a normal action/adventure film.The trouble is Guy Pearce as Dr. Alexander something-or-other has to try to pull these disparate elements together while coping with a lack of script and one of the worst accents ever.On top of this, too much of the film is reminiscent of other films, the soundtrack sounds like leftovers from Lord of the Rings, the Morlocks move like the soldier mummies from the recent Mummy films, etc.And it doesn't work. This is one of those films which may grow into a cult success, but it won't be a big hit. A sci-fi curate's egg with the parts being more interesting than the whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining in spite of plotholes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read some bad reviews before actually seeing this film so I was prepared for the worst. I have to say that the film was way better than I had expected it to be. Mind you, it is no masterpiece, but 'The Time Machine' is highly entertaining and benefits from its relatively short running time. Most blockbusters nowadays suffer from overlong running times, often dragging on, whereas they could easily have done with 20 minutes less.I have always liked the story by H.G. Wells, but this film is by no means a faithful adaption of this book, however, it is a sometimes inventive Hollywood take on the book. I haven't seen the 1960 adaption but most people in this review section seem to perceive this film as a remake of the 1960 film, but I see it more as a second movie adaption (Tim Burton will probably say Simon Wells 're-invented' the story :-) ).As I have said, the film is better than the bad reviews would suggest, but still you would have expected more of it just judging from the trailer and the multi-million dollar budget. So although I had a good time watching this film I can point out many weaknesses, e.g. the numerous plotholes.*** SPOILER!!! ***One reviewer mentioned what he regarded as a plothole: in the beginning Hartdegen is unable to change the past (the killing of his lover) and later on he is planning to change the future (i.e. the Eloi's past). The fact that he was unable to prevent the killing of his girl, was not due to some mysterious cosmic law saying that you cannot cheat fate/destiny. His girlfriend had to be killed because otherwise he would not have invented the time machine and could not have been in the past. His wife's dead led him to lock himself in his lab and work day and night on the time machine for four years. I'm not sure whether this is how time travelling would really work, but I'm afraid that time travel films always lead to this type of discussions. I can think of only one film, 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me', where there was no discussion possible because of a 'disclaimer' uttered by Basil in the film (paraphrase): 'don't worry about any details, just enjoy yourself'. And I guess that goes for 'The Time Machine' as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After looking through these pages I have just realised that this film was indeed a remake ? but all the better I would now want to see the original because this film was indeed a superb piece of work.I went in the cinema with the idea in mind that this film will make an update to the 80's classic `Back to the Future'. My judgement changed soon, as `Time Machine' has the same ?seriousness' as the film `Frequency', with Dennis Quaid.I was very moved throughout, for his time-travel attempts were to prevent his loved one from being killed ? don't worry, this is how the story begins and there is more to the story than where that came from. Just appreciate the very special effects of the film ? they are just so believable.I am quite surprised that the BBFC has rated this film for cinema exhibition as PG. Scenes involving the Morlocks are indeed very graphic and scary. Theyare way too intense and I can only imagine how my 6-year old nephew will react to it. I would expect the video to be rated 12.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>full of adventure but lacking in depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine was all that I expected it to be, for the most part. It is a magnificent adventure into the past. That being said, it is not as exciting as, say, Raiders of the Lost Ark. The Time Machine is a nice 1 1/2 hour diversion from the real world that will be enjoyable as long as you don't expect it to be the next great adventure pic, or the groundbreaking work that the original Time Machine was.I like Guy Pearce as a male lead. He has an honest, do-good face and seems to be a man of intelligence. He appears stiff at times throughout The Time Machine; some more emotion and wonder would have been appropriate. Still, he does his part in the film to my satisfaction.Jeremy Irons plays a villain-type but, as has been mentioned before, takes precious little screen time in the film. This is a shame because his character is by far the most intriguing out of the entire film. I would have loved an extended monologue by him, and more verbal exchange between his and Pearce's characters. Besides that, there is not much to note here. The Time Machine works as an adventure film, but does not achieve emotional or even intellectual depth on any level. Near the end, when we see Irons' character, we feel the movie may be attaining a higher meaning, but the ending dashes any hopes of this. Instead of giving insight into the dangers and benefits of time travel, or into the brilliant mind of the horrific, all-powerful Uber-Morlock, we simply get a physical contest between 2 characters. A boring ending to what was an intriguing picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the special effects with the geological changes being the most impressive, what a waste of time the movie was. To many open ended items, like why didn't he go back a third time to try to save Emma. And before he gets to 800,000 A.D. he only does one stop, instead of three in the original movie so no sense of change.A couple of nice touches from the original 1960's movie, but the movie gets lost long before Jeremy Irons appears, what WAS his characters function about. Mumba looks pretty and is effective but is just a reason for the hero to go through the heroic numbers in a typical Hollywood action packed light show final.Even the ending was left you hanging. Don't go and see the movie if you have seen the original and want to compare it, you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS herein**I enjoyed this one a bit, but nothing to write home about.However implausible my sci-fi, I do like it to be at least internally consistent. They establish a principle in the first 30 minutes of the film, which is explored, and then gleefully ignored in the finale, to whit the idea that you can't change the past (because the universe will find some way of having those events happen anyway), and the finale has the classic exchange "What are you doing?" "Changing the future" (which is the past of the place he had just gone to, so by the films own logic, was going to happen anyway...). Oh by the way, there are more Moloch "clans" so its not like you managed to do anything anyway..Other gripes This is an adaptation, pretty much, in the "inspired by/based on" vein rather than a faithful copy of either the book or the George Pal film (which gleefully gets referenced..) 1st major alteration... they did it again, yet another story set in england, adapted so its set in New York (at least, the present day bits are.) While fair enough, the whole apocalypse/future thing is switched a bit because in this day and age, nuclear war isn't really something most of us worry about like we did in the 60's, and they do come up with an interesting way of doing it (breaking up the moon, thus freaking with orbits and causing damage by moon rock and other forces (I'll have to check whether the orbital mechanics would work on it, and whether that would be enough to screw with earth (even ignoring showers of moon rock, it might get nasty.)They also show, as he travels into the distant future, the whole glaciation/erosion/sedimentation/deposition sequences. He gets buried, brought out, buried, brought out, frozen, etc. Yet the plot information macguffin, oh sorry photon, managed to survive with all (or most) of its glass panels intact. Oh please.....Characters - Jeremy Irons' character is, depending on your point of view and how you interpret the story, either the most one-dimensional bad guy imaginable, or it's a really clever portrayal of a man/thing thats happy with its position of power, and doesnt care one whit who this guy is or where he's from beyond "Don't disturb my structure around here." He really doesnt seem to care too much either way actually. Either very clever or very flat. Your call. Guy Pearce..well, he's an australian playing an american who's character started out as english, but with the kind of REALLY dreadful irish accent that puts you in mind of Angel from Buffy. He also reminds me very much of someone...maybe a second-rate Brad Pitt-alike or something.The finale also has a couple of plot holes. How did getting the watch caught in the gears turn the Time Machine into a Time Bomb? (If you look closely at the disintegrating Molochs, you can see they do that same rapid age/decay thing that Irons' character does. Thus its some sort of discharge of time energy or some equally odd macguffin).Turn your brain off and you MIGHT enjoy this one. I did, but that didn't stop me seeing the mile-wide flaws in it..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not really an improvement over George Pal's 1960 film, except for the vastly superior effects, but the 1978 made-for-TV version is practically an embarrassment next to this updated take on H.G. Wells' classic story. Directed by Wells' great-grandson Simon Wells, whose previous experience is solely non-Disney animation like Prince of Egypt, the story follows Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) as he first travels back in time to try to save the life of his fiancée (Sienna Guillory), and then forward in time to find out why he failed. Most of the movie takes place some 800,000 years in the future, when humanity has been divided into two sects, the peace loving Eloi and the Morlocks, who hunt the Eloi for food. I found it a little hard to believe that so many New York City artifacts survived all those centuries (the Eloi use them to teach their children English), but I was willing to let it all slide because the movie was otherwise enjoyable.

		<shortDescription>provides just enough goofy entertainment to give you your money's worth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With adaptations of household-name, classic novels to movies, you can either take it very seriously and adapt it faithfully, perfect examples being the two recent mega-hyped fantasy films released around Christmas last year; or you can treat them like Disney does, with the screenwriters taking absolute liberty with the source and turning it into the latest action-packed special effects extravaganza, like that little action movie remake involving apes from last year. At least THE TIME MACHINE knows it belongs in the latter category and makes it clear from the beginning. The setting is no longer London, but New York; the Time Traveler, played here by Guy Pearce (MEMENTO), is now given a name, professor Alexander Brantdegen; the set-up is completely different from the novel, this one involving the professor's mission to find a way to change the past so he can prevent his fiancé from dying.THE TIME MACHINE never takes itself seriously, and in its beginning sequences it's a pleasure to drink in the laid-back, predictable storytelling, completely tongue-in-cheek style, and popping your eyes out at the marvelous special effects showing Alexander traveling through time to the year 2030. The time machine itself is a wonderfully-designed prop, and combined with the detailed set design by Oliver Scholl it makes for some really satisfying eye candy. Also, watching disasters happen to the Moon as a result of our excessive nuclear explosions there is a visually exciting moment. Orlando Jones provides some good fun as a compendium of all human knowledge, a hologram guide in the museum of 2030 where Alexander goes to find information, particularly when singing parts of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, or strangely mentioning that a novel called "The Time Machine" was actually written by one H.G. Wells at the same time Alexander built one, and that a movie was made out of it in 1960. This is the moment when THE TIME MACHINE almost lapses into self-parody, and it's not the only moment that will leave you shaking your head. Things get increasingly ridiculous when Alexander arrives in the year 802701 following an accident with his machine: he discovers that as a result of the Moon splitting up, for some reason we have divided into two separate populations. One are the friendly, suntanned Eloi living above ground, the others the ugly Morlocks living mostly underground and using the Eloi as a food resource. This second part of the movie completely loses the innocence and appeal of the first, turning into a clone of the likes of PLANET OF THE APES and BATTLEFIELD EARTH. And when Jeremy Irons appears near the end as the Über-Morlock, their leader, you know the film has little intention of maintaining the sense of fun it started out with, and simply ending with a typical, preposterous explosion that neatly resolves everything.Fortunately though, director Simon Wells (H.G.'s great-grandson) still handles this obligatory material with some originality and visual flair, more or less holding our attention even when the cheesy-looking Irons character drones on in exposition, explaining the Morlocks' origins, and giving a big chase scene at the end a dizzying visual treatment. He also knows how to end his movie on the right note, with a final scene that's old-fashionedly appealing and original at the same time. There may not be much of a point to this "re-imagining" of the famous tale, and it can be awfully cheesy and uneven in parts, but the bottom line is that, much like last year's PLANET OF THE APES redux, this TIME MACHINE provides just enough goofy entertainment to give you your money's worth. Rating 0-10: 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, I know if you are a purist then you more than likely won't enjoy this movie, but I have to admit, this flick grabbed me by the coat tails and dragged me along for the duration. I had a ball and so did my partner and her son. Effects wise, nothing new, but the music and action holds your attention. Guy Peirce does a great jamiroquai impersonation. (sorry but, he sure looks like him, especially with the scruffy beard). Reminiscient of the old Saturday matinee, Time Machine is a ripping yarn.

		<fullReview>Well, close! I still count the 1960's version in my top 50 best movies.. I HAD to see the remake, no matter what the critics said! I was mildly entertained, mildly dazzled, mildly satisfied... Like a luke-warm cup of tea when only piping hot would do. Not even a hint of how the machine works, how or when he tested it, how lasers were used in it's design, why he put so MANY digits on the year counter... wasn't he concerned that so far into the future he might materialize under a lake? Whew! The makeup on the Morlocks, especially the "chief" was over done. I found the makeup a distraction. Also humorous, not scary. If this is what I'm gonna look like in 800,000 years I need to buy a case of lip balm and wrinkle remover. Yuk!  The plot? Predictable, but mildly entertaining... that luke-warm tea again. In fact, less special effects and more of everything else would have helped this movie... BUT-- was I entertained? In a luke-warm way, yes! about 60% as good as the original. For the money spent, could have been a lot better! 5 outta 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never read the original novel by H.G Wells, people told me its a classic. But two things stuck in my mind after watching this movie. First, the special effects were great. Second, I really wished that I could have my own time machine, to get back 90 minutes of my life that this movie stole from me.There's a slight spoiler ahead in this review, but there isn't anything in this movie that anyone hasn't seen before, so I wouldn't worry about it.At first I honestly thought that this was going to be an intelligent time-travel story. When the movie starts, it has an interesting premise of a doomed love story about a couple that can never be, and its potential for a moral perspective of one man's desire to change history without understanding its implications. When the scientist is hurled 800,000 to the future, we see grand spectacles of the Earth changing landscapes ... very, very nice. Sadly, once we got to meet the Elois, those trusty old Hollywood formulas rears its ugly head once more (no surprise there). The tiresome good guy vs bad guy plot even makes the word cliche seems so overused and old. You can tell from the pacing and plot that this movie was made in a certain way to get the green light from Hollywood's great formula makers. Halfway through, the nerdy and bumbling mathematician suddenly turns into Mr. Terminator and plays it macho that would make Ahnuld proud ... and of course, along with the compulsory "run out from the cave to escape the explosion behind you" scene, the hero saves the day and everyone lives happily ever after. It's as if Hollywood thinks the audiences are made as soft as custards, unable to bear the pain of tragic or open-ended endings, which are sorely missed nowadays.This is from someone who hasn't read the book, so just see the movie and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite disappointing overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to view the remake of the George Pal version of The Time Machine, I went with an open mind, but also with high hopes. Surely the time (sic) which had passed between the classic version and this new one, would have allowed evolution to take its course and to deliver much of what the original merely hinted at. I was to be disappointed.I have claimed that this new version of The Time Machine, is a remake of the George Pal version, rather than a new interpretation of the novella, as I feel that the major influences on this new work to be George Pal's adaptation and the "sequel" novel The Time Ships (with its verbal Morlock), rather than the director's grandfather's work.The traveller in both works, I am proud to say, were played by Australians! (Rod Taylor and Guy Pierce). It was also nice to see Alan Young's cameo in the new version.The original Time Machine film by Pal attempted to assume that its audience MAY think about the film. When the machine was exposed to others (ie The Morlocks), it was purloined and the Traveller on all other occasions made sure that he had secured the craft or stayed near it. Pierce's traveller, likes to wander and has little concern for such security.Taylor's traveller only braved The Morlocks when he knew that fire would subdue them. Pierce's traveller has no such knowledge nor reservations about risking his life. One cannot but feel that this is an unlikely flaw.Similarly, he is easily discouraged that he can't change the past. After working for four years on building a machine, he abandons his desire when he fails in the first attempt.There is, in the new version, none of Pal's passion for our sense of responsibility to the planet; the contempt for the martial and ruthless nature of humans, and that saddened me. What was a story of a perceptive individual's desire for utopia, was perverted into a mixed up intergalactic, "the next girl will do" pseudo love story.The special effects are good. Mark Addy and Christopher Lee are wonderful. Guy and the wonderful Phylidda Law are good also, but if you have the choice, miss it at the box office and opt for the video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Time Machine is back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked The Time Machine because he couldn't change the past he wanted to go to the future and find out why. I liked the special effects which looked real. When he was time-traveling we could see the way time changed in the world around him. Plants grew at a rapid pace. Different people moving into his home. The fashions were rapidly changing. New York's buildings were getting bigger and were improving as time flew by. And a Moon Base was being built. Then he stopped the machine in the year 2030. I liked the way the future was predicted. The main reason why is because I will still be alive in the year 2030 and I want to see a world very similar to what the writer of the book The Time Machine(H.G. Wells) thought up. In the very distant future there are two distinct species the Eloi and the Moorlocs. The Eloi had very complicated structures of buildings made of bamboo. The moorlocs are very different to the Eloi and their make-up made them look like real creatures. The ending of the movie was different to the original movie. It was very entertaining; I don't want to spoil the movie. The whole movie was enjoyable. I recommend it. There was only really one thing that bugged me, I thought that he should have done more time traveling to make the movie more interesting.I recommend seeing it and I will read the book by H.G. Wells to see which version of the movie is more like the book than original story.I give this movie 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pointless, flat, and useless reimagining....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine is flat, useless, and tiresome. It's an absurd remake of the H.G. Wells novel, directed by Simon Wells. It uses its visual effects to wow us, then uses its ridiculous plot devices to stupefy us.Alexander Hartdegan (Guy Pearce) is a brilliant but bumbling mathematician. Can't we, for once, have a brilliant man of science who isn't a complete, bumbling idiot? Or is that too much to ask? Anyway, he is in love with the beautiful Emma (Sienna Guillory), but on the night he proposes to her, something tragic happens. So, he becomes a recluse and hides for four years secretly working on a time machine so he can go back in time and save her. The machine gets built and he travels back four years. The problem is, no matter how many times a person tries to change history, one cannot alter fate.Alex travels to New York in the year 2030, and then he travels further in time when he learns that the moon is falling and dropping off large chunks that hit the Earth. It is there where he gets knocked unconscious, but not before he can push the joystick and go whizzing through time. He wakes up about 800,000 years later. Man has evolved into the Eloi and the Morlocks. The Eloi are a peaceful group of people that are hunted by the evil Morlocks. The Morlocks look like a cross between John Travolta in Battlefield Earth and Joan Rivers. It's not a pretty sight. Alex meets a beautiful Eloi woman named Mara (Samantha Mumba). The two develop a romance, even though he is roughly 800,000 years older than her. At the same time, he helps the Eloi fight against the Morlocks, which brings us to a final scene with poor Jeremy Irons playing the Uber Morlock.The Time Machine never explains to us the craft of time traveling. It never tells us how Alex concocted this creation, or even how he built it. The time machine just pops out of nowhere and we're off! The time machine looks fantastic. The whole movie looks fantastic, except for the cartoonish and laughable Morlocks, but striking visuals aren't enough. There is no sense of wonderment or awe. Director Simon Wells never takes joy into consideration, so we have a flaccid and just plain boring B-movie.Guy Pearce, in the beginning, plays Alexander Hartdegan as a charming idiot. But that characteristic is quickly forgotten and he becomes a macho man who is able to beat up a very strong Morlock. I highly doubt that someone who was hiding out for four years would have the strength that Guy Pearce has. Perhaps Johnny Depp would have been a better choice, whose comedic performance in Sleepy Hollow added a lot to the film. Jeremy Irons knows he's in a bad movie and hams it up. He offers a fun, silly performance that's both enjoyable and unnecessary.Walking into The Time Machine I wanted to be taken on a whimsical journey. I wanted to experience something new. But, it recycles landscapes from A.I. and Battlefield Earth, so there is no sense of wonderment. The first half hour of The Time Machine was very promising, but it suddenly took a turn for the worst. But hey, at least it's not as bad as Battlefield Earth.---------2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book...what can we say, it is a classic. My million dollar question is, how can someone base their movie in a classic book turn out to be so superficial? let me explain...To be really honest, I really hate saying bad things about this film. It is like a nice cute puppy. You really don't want to do anything bad to it. O.K., inorder to give this film a fair go, lets look at it as a stand alone thing (so no comparison with the book).(Spoilers ahead)The start of the movie was excellent. I really loved it. The acting was good, the film was nicely shot...everthing was going swell...great computer effects...but suddenly, like a time travel into a bad script, the movie turned horrible wrong. The time traveller went into another movie! And what is that movie you may ask? WEll, let me give you a hint, it is a movie with alot of monkies in it. The second half of the Time Machine is exactly the same as the Planet of the Apes. And to make things even worst, those so called 'species' looked like a carbon copy from the creatures taken from the Lord of the Rings. Confused? Well, I am telling the truth.But I guess I am going to far with the assessment of the movie. If you don't mind sitting in a mind and leave your brain out the door of the cinema, by all means, watch this. If you would perfer to leave your brain intact with your head, read the book instead. The book is alot more deeper and philosophical than the movie, I can assure you that. It was ashame I could not time travel back to the production of this film and tell the director what was wrong with it so he can change it.</fullReview>

If I go to the year 100,000 first then I cannot change the year 800,000 because it is in the past.In short: a good film to the popcorn eaters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic story with modern props and sets. A nifty time machine, a whiz bang hologram, a changed moon and charming cliff dwellings. 2 Flys Out Of Five.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine inherits some pretty sweet concepts, is sensibly pretty short (96 minutes) and displays a couple of neat sets and props. HG Wells wrote the original story over a hundred years ago and the idea still has charm. This film relocates the machine from London to New York (of course) and of course has updated some of the elements. I did like machine. It's all whirring gyroscopes, brass rings to tell the year and a leather bound old chair. Pretty nifty I reckon.Then there's a hologram the time traveler meets in the future. The hologram (played by Orlando Jones) is a know all, literally. It's got the history of literature and science in it's computer memory banks and can launch into choral version of songs, in beautiful harmony just by replicating itself.And then there's a phase in the future that we see involving the moon. This doesn't bear further explanation for fear of spoiling the idea, but that was interesting.We later travel 800,000 years into the future which would have to be some sort of record for these films. What's recommended there are the dwellings of some of the humans living at that time. They're suspended on cliffs and really are eye catching. The Time Traveler is called Alexander and is played by Aussie Guy Pierce. Pierce makes Alexander a rather fey, love sick puppy. That's fine until Alexander has to physically battle some baddies in the far future. By then The Time Machine had become fairly humdrum anyway. 2 Sets And Props Flys Out Of Five.</fullReview>

I know the original may have been like that, but only a small part of the viewers have seen the original. I wanted an epic movie, that I could tell my grandchildren that i saw at the cinema.

It starts out with romance and ends up with lots of action.Yes it deals with time travel, but the science behind time travel is left out of the movie. I suppose movies like this are billed as science fiction simply because they take place in another time and place. But real science fiction should deal with science, not just the plot that the science leads to, as this one does.The Time Machine is interesting as a romantic movie and the action holds one's attention.

My assumption being that I would be in for a treat of high tech futuristic specical effects. To be honest, there were some, but painfully and obviously few. I think Guy Pearce struggles with this role and his accent wavers from the slightly American to shades of English...very confusing. The 'tribe' he encounters in the future adapt remarkably to speaking english in no time at all. Too many scenes looked fragmented and incomplete. The end result leaves me thinking this movie was not well directed and produced and therefore wasted the potential that the reputed $85m prouduction costs could have delivered.

		<fullReview>John Huston once said that one should only remake a movie if you can bring something new to the project. The Time Machine attempts to improve on the classic 1960 version with advanced special effects ? of course - and by giving the time traveler a motive. He is driven to build the time machine to fix his own tragic past. Unfortunately this attempt at motivation robs the remake of a sense of awe and mystery.In H. G. Well's novel, and the 1960 version, the time traveler is an optimistic and curious scientist. His thirst for knowledge is all the motive he needs to build his machine. When he travels, Rod Taylor's character is actively engaged in the thrill of the experience. His optimism and faith in science is tested by the horrors that he sees. In the remake, the time machine is a means to an end. Wrapped up in his tragic quest, Guy Pearce reacts to the wonders of time travel with the detachment of a man driving to the local supermarket. Because of his blasé attitude, all the efforts of the special effects artists seem beside the point ? tossed off if you will.In another well-intentioned mistake, the Eloi ? a sweet, affectless race the time traveler meets in the far distant future ? are portrayed as a gumbo of the world's ethnic types. They have a vibrant culture and seem a robust bunch. Far too robust, in fact, for their main function in the plot. While this change makes them more interesting and likable than the original's wan and degenerate Eloi, it also makes their relationship with the Morlocks absurd rather than horrifying.The Time Machine has a fine cast that takes the material seriously. No campy winks and nods here, thank goodness. Guy Pearce lacks the doughy he-mannishness Rod Taylor had in the original, but makes up for the lack with a good, focused performance. Jeremy Irons seems hell bent on carving out a second career for himself as the 21st Century's Vincent Price. No arguments here. We need a new Price and Iron's does cultured villainy with gusto. As for Orlando Jones, this guy has been the MVP of the last couple of movies I've seen him in, as he proves to be in The Time Machine. The movie truly comes alive in his few scenes as a sad computer program. This guy is good and richly deserves to star in a movie of his own.The Time Machine does have its moments. The time traveler's interview with the Uber-Morlock is eerie and the movie ends on a spooky and romantic note. There are some nice echoes of the original, from the look of the time machine itself to semi-recreations of whole scenes.At its heart The Time Machine is the type of movie AIP use to grind out by the dozens. Though it is too flawed for an enthusiastic recommendation, it does have the virtues of a good old-fashioned entertainment competently done. It gives good value for your ticket price, especially if you see it for matinee prices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try the George Pal version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see The Time Machine (2002) at the local 14-plex.I must say that the ORIGINAL Time Machine (1960) is one of my favorite films, especially science fiction. So I AM comparing the two - by default if not by design. It is impossible for me not to.The sound was great - but the film itself was really disappointing. Guy Pearce kind of stumbles through this DARK picture. Orlando Jones is totally wasted as a hologram at the NYC Public Library. Changing the setting from London to New York City got rid of the British/H.G.Welles ambiance in the original film - the turn of the century NYC scenes are slow and dull, thought this film flies by at 96 minutes. Another half hour should have been added at least to bring the Welles classic to life. Time travel certainly opens up plot development - why do you think Star Trek has used it so often?The film reminded me of two recent pictures - A Beautiful Mind and the remake of Planet of the Apes. I enjoyed both but both were unsatisfying by the end. So it goes with Time Machine. You never seem to know what is going on in this film, past, present, or future. The plot goes up several dark alleys before deciding to abruptly go south.There is little sense of going through time, despite the incredible special effects from Lucas/ILM. The film, as do so many today, gives off a 2000 version of the 1890's and it smells fake. The pacing of this film is so fast that it must have been made for the MTV generation.The original film is very slowly paced, but when time travel occurs it shifts into high gear and makes you believe - even with 40 year old SFX. Of course, these effects were George Pal's and he was a genius.Perhaps these are only the thoughts of a person who prefers uncut, widescreen, and classic films as compared to today's Ridley Scott/ Michael Mann pacing - the frantic and the furious. The Time Machine 2002 makes you feel like you HAVE traveled in time - about 45 minutes into the future when the credits roll.</fullReview>

I disagree with their choice of plot on how to set things up. The 1960 one had a much better premise. The premise was stupid, I won't tell you what it is because you might rent the movie. :-)I never expected to see puppets. I don't know if that surprise was good or bad. I tend to think the Morlocks were supposed to look real and they didn't. Maybe I expect too much for a low budget film.This film is definitely not worth seeing in a theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I see all of it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help feeling that I didn't see the whole movie. It seems to me that a good chunk of it was left on the cutting room floor. After it was over I found myself looking at my watch, and seeing if indeed, I got a full 2 hours and 10 minutes. No big deal, they will probably come out with a 4 hour DVD with 17 alternate endings. I hated Guy Pearce's accent. I've liked him a great deal in other movies, but someone needs to shoot the dialect coach. Every character in the movies was really underdeveloped. I guess they didn't have enough budget left over for that after the, gosh, very nifty cool visual effects. Jeremy Iron's character, reminds me of those female love interests in Jean Claude van Damme movies that are only there to explain things and push the plot forward. He wasn't really a villain with any motivation for anything. In fact, if you're going to make a movie about time travel, you need to make time itself a character, in the same way Final Destination, made the concept of death a character. Regarding the characters, I would have to say I found them each to be interesting enough in themselves, but not interesting as a group together in the same movie. Oh well, nice try.Whenever I see a time travel as a subject for film or TV I am reminded of Chiun from Remo Williams who said, "Time is merely a confidence trick invented by the Swiss."If you go see it, go during the matinee, don't pay full price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reviews Suprised me before hand, but unfortunatly I have to agree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the poster for this movie back in Aug 2001, I was all excited. I couldn't wait to see this movie. So, day of the big opening I read reviews on it. And I was so surprised about what I read, but, after seeing it, there a some comments that I agree with. Someone said that it was rushed, you couldn't even take a few min.s and enjoy the future, and that's a fact. Guy's Character seems fake. He is more brain then brawn, but charges forth into the lion's den instead of coming up with a plan. And there were parts (more then a couple) that were not explained.In my opinion Time Machine is one of those stories where you have to explain everything, you need to leave no open knots because this is the future is what Wells thinks it is. It's supposed to be shown to us, not left up to our imagination. And I just felt that there were points that were too rushed. Maybe seeing this movie as a screenplay is different from seeing the whole picture. Maybe there was a lot of editing done that should not have been. Maybe the David Duncan (wrote screen play) freaks out whenever he even hears about this movie, and how they changed it and ruined it. One more comment I agree with along the same lines, the biggest pity about this movie is the potential ruined.So, all in all, not a GREAT movie, why is that bad even though it was an okay movie?? Because we were all expecting a great movie, and it didn't live up to that expectation. Good example why reading reviews before hand may be a good thing, it lowered my expectation before seeing it. Maybe that is why I don't dislike this movie more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read many comments on the new Time Machine. I couldn't help comparing what this version lacked, compared to the 1960 version. I wanted to like it, really! However, what I missed was the narration of the main character, as he travelled, what he hoped to see and what the future would bring. The Emma storyline was ok, but they could have done so much more with that. Alexander really needed to let go of her, so he could emotionally embrace the future. The moon disaster was very well done, but I know some of you will hate me, I couldn't stand to look at Jeremy Irons (too sci-fi looking). Sorry. I know they kept the dress shop, but I wanted him to comment on the changing styles as he did in 1960.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing Snooz-fest ** Spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought they were going to go somewhere with this movie and then maybe someone thought they would honor the original by not surpassing it. They succeeded. I went into this movie perhaps with to many expectations. I was wide-eyed and ready to be dazzled visually. I was clear headed and was ready to have my intelligence challenged. I should have slept through the movie. My dreams are more exciting than The Time Machine, and they are usually a repeat of my workday. Don't get me wrong , the movie wasn't awful; it just wasn't fulfilling. There were far too many things unexplained. Perhaps I was not paying close enough attention but: **Spoilers **  I don't understand where Alexander (Guy Pearce) got the idea that he could not change the past. Are we supposed to assume that when he(Guy) is in the hospital with his friend that he has made numerous attempts to save Emma's life? He spends four years creating a device that will send him back through time to prevent her death and after only one failed attempt, he gives up? Isn't love grand? Instead he'll find out why he can't change the past by asking someone in the future. Alrighty then... Next I had a problem with the first future stop: The year is 2030 and we have a moon colony. Humm. Are we to believe that we will have a moon colony in 28 short years and we haven't even had a fully successful Mars mission yet. Possible, maybe: probably not. But the makers of this film had all the time in the world to work with; couldn't they have moved it up to 2230 or even 2130 to allow enough of a cushion to be a little more believable? Ok onward. Seven years later the moon explodes and Alex is off to see the Eloi, Moorlocks, and Jeremy Irons. Poor Alex has been knocked out, so gets picked up by the local Eloi babe, she nurses him back to health, he falls in love with her and forgets all about his beloved Emma. Love really is grand! All this in the span of what seem to be just a few days after this whole past and future journey began. I don't even remember the lame answer that was given to explain why the past can't be changed but I understood that it couldn't happen. So here we are and we now know the past can't be changed?. Well I guess it actually can be? just this once. If I'm not mistaken, Alex-Guy, after killing the bad Jeremy-guy, goes back and destroys the Moorlocks and saves the girl, right? Or did I see a different movie? Or did I fall asleep and miss the part where everything is explained???I was so let down by the all of the unexplained that I wish the Moorlocks would have eaten everbody. I was about to say that the best thing about the movie was Jeremy Iron's performance but that would be pushing it. Jeremy wasn't bad. What made the performance was that he looked like a long-haired, spooky, bad-ass. Bottom line: Don't expect anything like the original or to have anything explained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to hate hate this film. I am a huge fan of the George Pal version and I usually hate remake's of what I consider to be classic films. However.. I was kinda surprised. I LIKED most of this film. It was a genuine attempt at an update and almost pulled it off. The characters could of used a bit more flushing out. Philby was such an important friend in the original film and you could tell. This one sort of falls short. The Morlocks were visually fantastic. Much better than the original. Originals looked like big ugly smurf's. A very good film that could of gone to the original again as far as an ending goes. I wish I could go into more detail but I really can't without spoiling several plot points and ruining a few surprises. Still, a mostly good film that I would recommend</fullReview>

And poor Jeremy Irons, a great actor reduced to a freak with his spine and brain sticking out. The only likeable thing about this movie was Orlando Jones. I cared more what happened to his computer being than I did the humans in the movie. Please don't waste you money on this one.

Also, the transitions of New York over 800,000 years is amazing. Truly incredible. Others have commented on Guy Pearce's appearance, and I have to agree for the first half.

		<fullReview>I was very excited and worried about this movie from the first day I heard about it. I thought to myself. "I sure hope it does not suck." On the other hand, I just could not wait to see what they did with it.I found out. I must say, I think this version of "The Time Machine" is a great one. Everyone has to wine about remakes all the time. Why?! I think it's cool. You get to watch one of your favorite movies again, but it's reborn! I find I enjoy both 2002 and 1960 versions equally. I like some things better in one version than the other and so on, but really they stand alone as different movies. The 1960 version was what I like to call "documentary style." It has narration, it moves a little slower and it's all about discovery. The 2002 version is about a problem, and the characters quest to fix it.The 2002 version is a SOLID film. I have little complaints, but I will share. I think the movie was too short, I would have not minded if the movie was 15+ min longer. Maybe a stop in the 1900's would have been nice. Or maybe I am mistaken? Did he stop in the 1900's? Heh, I guess I will have to watch it again! Call me crazy, but I liked the way the future people lived in the 1960 version, it was creepy. Plus Weena kicked ass man!One could go on and on about each version, but you can just see it for yourself. In ending I would just like to say, I love this version as well is the 1960 version. Have fun with it.I gave both versions 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappoint to Say the Least...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's just a shame when a film based on one of the most enduring novels of all time performs so poorly in the story department. Obviously something went wrong.Perhaps my expectations were too high. I just couldn't imagine that H.G. Wells' great-grandson would botch his novel so badly, and I was very excited for this movie because I love Guy Pearce. He is one of my favorite actors.But this adaptation just did not work, and I blame Simon Wells' direction and whoever so poorly adapted the novel into the screenplay.I enjoyed the first half hour and the last five minutes, however the time traveling sequences make up the bulk of the film, and that is where the story lagged the most.In the first half hour these characters had feelings and motives, but that was all forgotten when the director decided to rely on awesome special effects instead of simple storytelling during the time traveling. Visually this film was stunning, from the machine, the effects as time passed, the costumes, and the scenery, but there was practically nothing beneath all this glitz to truly capture the viewer's interest.Also the time traveling sequences made absolutely no sense. There were so many inconsistencies. Yes, this is science fiction, but there was absolutely no logic dictating how time travel works in the film because I suppose the director didn't care enough to include that. Perhaps he thought if he created something pretty enough it would distract away from the lack of sense in the story.Another thing that truly bothered me was the way Guy Pearce's character seemed to be almost schitzophrenic throughout the film. When does a humble physics professor turn into an action hero? He was fighting a genetically engineered warrior and talking about starting a rebellion! He changed that much all in the course of two days?I walked out of the theater with so many unanswered questions, the primary one being, "If H.G. Wells had a time machine, would he travel to 2002 and boycott this empty adaptation?" I think he would.I gave it a 7 just because the visuals were extraordinary and the performances were fine throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Different Remake of the 1960 Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the supporting characters remain the same, but this is still a very different interpretation that adheres only in a very cursory fashion to George Pal's 1960 film based upon the HG Wells novel.This version moves the location from 1900 London to 1899 New York City. The traveller is an english professor who has moved to NY to teach.Gone is the character of Weena - replaced by the character of Mara.Special effects are terrific -- but special effects do not make the movie.The Morlocks are reminiscent of a cross between the Orcs of the recent film Lord of the Rings, and the apes from last summer's Planet of the Apes. It's a good modernization of the make-up effects, and the Morlocks are a lot less sensitive to light.I found this movie to be less interesting and endearing than the 1960 characters.While the traveler's obsession with time travel is humanized and understandable, I found the character of Alex to be akin to watching a very wimpy version of Pierce Brosnan. The very dynamic character spawned by Rod Taylor's depiction in the 1960 film was more compelling, more admirable, and more heroic. It also played for more believably with Alan Young's character of David Philby, and Sebastian Cabot's Doctor.This is a just OK film. Alan Young has a cameo appearance as a flower shop storekeeper, but this is the only endearing part of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far superior to the cheesy 1960 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an engaging, plausible (given the premise of time travel) adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel. While bringing the original story up-to-date, it also adds some important touches, like giving the main character, Alexander Hartdegen, a strong personal reason for wanting to travel through time. The acting is quite good--there are no weak spots--and the special effects don't overwhelm the movie. And, unlike the 1960s George Pal version, it attempts to grapple with some of the paradoxes of time travel.Talking about the earlier version, I can't understand the nostalgia about that banal piece of fluff. Has anybody watched it lately? I did and found it far worse even than I had remembered. It's slow, pedantic, over-acted and drowned by an overly loud and pervasive score that tries to substitute music for emotion and excitement. The current remake packs a lot more emotion and excitement while being 10 minutes shorter. With so many films nowadays going over 2 hours--often way over--bringing in a coherent, exciting and satisfying story at 93 minutes is a commendable achievement in itself. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on March 9th and was realy disappointed with the finished product. The movie is good only in the second third, so only about 30 minutes. We don't feel any feelings for the characters and the movie only lasts 1h30 so nothing can be clearly explained. It would have been great if the time traveller could have past some time in 2030, and if we had learned more on the moon desintegration thing because that part of the plot is original! For once, it's not the sun or a nuclear war that ruined the earth, it's the MOON!!! And the Guy Pearce character had a "WILSON-HANKS" like attraction to a girl he hardly new... Well, I'll stop right here. I'd rather recommend the 1960 version. We can at least feel the notion of time travel in that version...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Have Three Words To Say...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, I have but three words to say...read the book. If you really want to get the full essence of H.G. Wells's incredible story, the movie does not come close to doing it justice. I completed reading the actual novel less than two months ago, and the inconsistancies between the novel and the movie drove me nuts the entire time I was in the theatre. I realize that most novel to movie scenarios have SOME inconsistancies between them, but the entire movie was pretty much unrelated to the novel. In fact, I found very few similarities between the two at all, one of which is that Alex, reffered simply to as "The Time Traveler" in the novel, travels to the same year in both the novel and the movie (800,207 I believe). Another is that there is a seperation between two classes of people, named the Eloi and the Morlocks in both cases (although the movie portrays the Eloi far from how they are described in the novel, and the main Eloi character has been replaced by someone else, the Morlocks seem pretty accurate, aside from the "head" Morlock who does not exist in the novel). The only other similarity I noticed was the fact that Alex (Time Traveler) happened to travel through time. The rest of it was in no way connected at all. For example, in the movie, Alex's motivation for building the Time Machine is to save his girlfriend. The novel mentions NOTHING about a girlfriend and The Time Traveler builds the machine out of pure scientific interest. The movie skips everything the novel explains about how the Time Traveler says the machine works. Something that really bothered me was that in the movie, some of the Eloi spoke English. In the novel, the Eloi could NOT speak English and the Time Traveler had to learn their language. Also, the world of 800,207 is described as being COMPLETELY different in the novel than it is portrayed in the movie, but I won't detail it. They took a literary classic (and in my opinion, a great novel) and made a complete mockery out of it. My boyfriend, who I went with to see the movie, pointed out that the movie might not have been made to portray the novel closely, but rather to bounce a story off of. If that was the case, no refference to H.G. Wells's novel should have been made AT ALL. Alex could have traveled to a different year, and the Eloi and Morlocks could have been named otherwise. But as long as those tiny little similarities are there, the movie can be classified as being a representation of the novel, and it has accomplished this poorly.</fullReview>

Instead of war being the end-all for civilization as in the original, it is a positive passion for advancing embodied by a failed colonization of the moon that plunges the world into its darkest days.The film then takes those in modern times who show ambition and warps them into the most absurd and twisted spectres (morloks), taken to illegitimate ends pointing the finger and saying, "If you want to go forward, by all means try, but you'll end up like this."So, by all means, if you'd like to feed an industrial machine (Hollywood) by paying to see a film exposing the "perils" of industry, business and capitalism, view the most recent version of "Time Machine."

Consider the lame performance by Guy Pearce (who is almost always reliable), who is miscast in this film. Guy stumbles through the film, doing everything wrong. There is also the lackluster direction by Simon Wells, who is clearly incapable of directing live action. There is the film's short length; just when it starts to make a bit of sense -- it ends. The film has a few nice special effects, ONE decent action scene, and that's about it. A complete waste of TIME and MONEY. If I had a Time Machine I'd use it and try and change the past -- I'd stop myself from seeing this film.Irons is campy as hell -- and strange as it is, he's the only thing that works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NY is the world!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>in a long stream of consecutive bad movies i've seen at the theatres, the time machine happened to follow queen of the damned. the reason i make the connection between the two is because these two ethnocentric movies assume that wherever they start their story with is the world. Akasha promises Lestat to rule the world, and they always land in California. Long live Hollywood! The Vatican of California. Anyway, same thing here, the world goes through a heck of a lot, and even when two separate species develop from the humans, the little that remain alive manage to crowd themselves where New York used to be. It all takes place in NY. Long live ethnocentric America! You are the world! But the badness doesn't end there. Look at the moon in the park where the professor meets his future fiancee. White stuff is raining around it! If you miss it the first time, you'll get a chance to see it again when the professor returns to the park. Some poor fellas in post-production didn't notice that they did a half-ass job with the CG, twicde! Or, you could say that it's a visual hint to what is going to happen to the moon in the future. Anyway, the badness still goes on. But here start the SPOILERS: The underground cerebral mutant explains to the professor that the new species can't live above the ground. Yet, the hunt scene happens in broad daylight. What the heck!? And the little kid says the professor's watch was stolen while they were sleeping in their safe little huts on the side of a cliff. Why wait for daylight the next day to hunt those humans if it's just as easy to sneak in their little house they think are safe? Why live on a cliff side if your predator can sneak in at night anyway? And what is up with this mind controlling freak who ends up fighting the professor in a hand-combat where he proves to be stronger although he casted himself into a developed brain, and not a bunch of biceps? Why didn't he create an illusion for the professor to jump out of the time machine and rot? And this whole assumption on the professor's part that based on two failures he could try a thousand times to see his love die in a thousand different ways! This attitude simply reflects the writer's. Whoever wrote this decided that no matter how many times their character went into the past, they would end up with the same thing, so they stuck to the dumbest storyline possible--which exceeded their expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much time on effects, not enough on characters. *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could barely remember the 1960 version so I went into this hoping to bereminded. Apart from the future image of human devolution this is hardly thesame film. The beginning attempts(and mostly succeeds) to capture theatmosphere of the original but ultimately loses it's way. The Time Machine itself is quite an amazingly constructed brass and glass creation but it'sincomprehensible design is nowhere near as memorable as the Pal version.Considering the theme this movie has all the trademarks of something that ran out of time. The effects are visually interesting and the results of Stan Winston's Creature Shop are as usual excellent. The characters have little time to develop though before we are rushed back and forth into the future. Along the wayscenery changes, the Moon falls apart (probably the most interesting visualeffect of the future) and just when the story starts to build momentum it just well, ends. Of course the benefit of the short running time is that it doesn't outstay it's welcome. However, like movie popcorn when it's over it does leave you feeling empty, unsatisfied and in search of something a bit more fulfilling.Acting is competent but apart from Guy Pearce nobody else has enough screentime to make any significant contribution. Samantha Mumba breaks the curse of teen pop star to actor transitions by actually being watchable and her kidbrother is okay too. Orlando Jones (Evolution) is an entertaining if totallyunrealistic diversion who thankfully isn't as annoying as Chris tucker in the Fifth Element. Watching Jeremy Irons you could be thinking it's David Bowie from Labyrinthand you'll be wondering why he bothered to appear in such a ridiculous role as well. Maybe the script writers had been watching "Beneath the Planet of theApes" that night and (for lack of any other dramatic conclusion) thought hewould be a good thing to stick in near the end. ***SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD***When the movie finishes before you expect you'll be left with a myriad ofnon-paradox related questions.Why did the producers at the test screenings fail to notice the entire audience unintentionally laughing at the supposedly sad scene near the beginning? If Future Guy Pearce is at the hospital near the beginning why doesn't Present Guy Pearce notice a huge gleaming brass Time Machine that he hasn't bult yetin his greenhouse? If the Moon has broken up wouldn't the larger fragments be orbiting the Earth and not what remains of the Moon? It does look good though! Exactly why do they pull the boats up? How does the hologram device still operate 800,000+ years into the futuredespite the earth completely and utterly changing?

		<shortDescription>Terrible, but Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with most of the things people have trashed this movie for. The script was laughable, the acting for the most part wooden (someone should tell Pearce that acting doesn't consist of shaking some small child when trying to emphasize your point), the intentional jokes were terrible (except for one by Jones), there were more holes in the plot than one could imagine was possible in under two hours, and to add one insult of my own, the special effects were not that good. The Morlocks moved like jerky wolves.What no one seems to realize was that this is what made the movie great scifi! I was laughing through the whole thing at how bad it was, and when it was over this movie made you think to try and explain the gaping tears in the plot. This is a perfect example of what bad scifi should be. It doesn't need good actors (with the notable exception of Jeremey Irons, who was simply fantastic), it doesn't need a good script. It should keep you interested while you're in the theater with action and special effects, and should leave room for interpretation.Now, I can't resist a little comparison between this version and the book. Sad to say, this was a more realistic version than the book. It was that old purist scifi in which there are no characters, just types. It even went so far as only the woman (Mumba in this movie) had a name, the other characters were 'the Traveller' or 'the Doctor'. I wouldn't waste your time reading it; I found it almost as tiresome as it was pretentious. I was so glad to see that in this movie the Eloi had actual lives and art and were able to do things for themselves. I only wish we had seen something of the Morlock culture.All that said, I had tons of fun with this movie, but I would not recommend it to people who don't enjoy bad action movies or old scifi B-movies.</fullReview>

(as Jeremy Irons states in his singular but movie-stealing scene.) Even the most jaded movie-goer will be shocked and captivated by the special effects that this movie has at nearly every second.Orlando Jones is excellent as "a compendium of all human knowledge" in the NY Public Library. There is an excellent dig as he looks up the subject "time travel" for the hero, coming up with "The Time Machine" by HG Wells, now a musical with a score by Andrew Lloyd Webber -- which he proceeds to sing .....Samantha Mumba, the Scottish pop star, proves she will not go the way of Britney Spears in "Crossroads" as a diva becoming an actress. She is completely believable as Mara, a futuristic woman of the Eloi people. Her younger brother Omero plays, well, her brother -- he is so cute and talented!

		<shortDescription>Compared to what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Time Machine", if taken on its own considerable merits, is a diverting and entertaining film with high production values and laudable attention to craft. It is nice to sit in a theater in 2002 and not be subjected to a film that clocks in at 140 minutes or more; brevity really is a virtue in film.Guy Pearce does what he can with his role of the nervous and obsessed but likeable scientist, but is generally ineffective in communicating the humanity of his character. Samantha Mumba is the exotic babe in the future (with commendably not-perfectly-capped teeth!)and posts a passable turn. Jeremy Irons brings a lot to his brief bit as the leader of the Morlocks, infusing a dignity and resignation that seems to go beyond the script. He certainly did not let his make-up do his acting for him.While we could have used a better set-up and some deeper character development, "The Time Machine", when taken on its own terms, is a high adventure film suitable for the rating (PG-13). The effects are uniformly good (and some are amazing), the plot is passably updated from the source materials and the whole affair is not insultingly dumb (like, say, "Armageddon") or exploitative. Extra points for the believable period setting of 1899, where the film opens.If I were thirteen, I would have loved this movie, and the kid in me did. And who cares if there was once another movie with the same name and somewhat based on the same material? In addition to the widely-loved (I thought it was hokey beyond belief) 1960 George Pal version, there was also a forgettable made-for-TV movie version in 1978, Nicholas Meyer's 1979 "Time After Time" which was in essence a re-imagining of the same basic concepts with a different plot, 1949's BBC adaptation of "The Time Machine" which probably no-one who has commented on this film saw... My point is that this "Time Machine" is its own film and should be judged based on its own merits. As such, it succeeds modestly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's an empty rush - great visual effects, poor character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film, though it could have been so much better. The effects were great, but there was almost no character development. Guy Pearce is a fabulous actor, but he didn't have much to work with. It seemed like pieces of the story were missing, as if a certain time limit had to be met so they edited out parts of the story. Maybe I'm being too critical. Obviously, this wasn't intended to be a grand epic film - it was supposed to be a typical Hollywood blockbuster with lots of suspense &amp; action, which is fine. I think "The Fellowship of the Rings" has spoiled me for life. =) "The Time Machine" had potential to be more than another typical Hollywood film, and it did have moments where it tried to be more. I'd recommend seeing it if you're in the mood for a suspenseful, visual effects-heavy film.</fullReview>

Mr. Hartdegen stumbles from one idea to the next, without really knowing, how he got there in the first place. Guy Pearce has the easy job to look astounded and bewildered.The original story is still visible through all the added scenes but mostly missing in the last 30 minutes, where the film's rushing from point A to B in a neckbreaking speed and BOOOM the film's over. As soon as the lights go on you realize the tons of possibilities, how this could have been a fun and thrilling night out ("The Mummy" pulled that of, didn't it?).

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: disappointing, see it anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the original book, I went on opening day, with perhaps my expectations set too high by how The Lord of the Rings honored its original book. The result was disappointing.Guy Pearce as usual did a fantastic job, and the visuals were pretty good (eerie how jaded we're getting about visuals, isn't it), but we've seen better.The opening bit, without giving away the story, was compelling. There was chemistry, we came to like the characters, and the late 19th century scene was engaging.Unfortunately, that's where it ended. The characters in the rest of the film went flat. There was no chemistry between the main characters. The main plot twist of the story is simply given away in a knot of exposition rather than felt. There is a lack of tension between love interests and between enemies, which left me bewildered when the film ended. Wait, was that the climax? Perhaps the film being a little cartoony had something to do with director Simon Wells' background in animated films.There should have been a lot of awe in the film, as our hero finds and reacts to new circumstances. That didn't come across emotionally. The Eloi (forest natives) stand around too much and we don't get a feeling of being put into the environment. Nobody gets dirty and a few nonsensical things pop out.There are some deep questions that don't get their due. In fact, I think there was probably too much 19th century and too little of the rest of the film; things were a little too rushed for us to feel an emotional stake in what was happening. In a way, that reminded me of the recent Harry Potter film.Also, the CGI monsters detracted from the film rather than added. Sort of goofy action, as in The Mummy (1999).Who should go see this film?-- science fiction fans (you know you want to)-- action fans who didn't think The Mummy was silly-- Guy Pearce fans-- people who like computer graphics and think time travel is coolOverall, it wasn't bad -- I give it a 6, better than campy, but not satisfying. From the strength of the original book, a better movie was certainly do-able. Don't worry, I'm sure the original story will persist and in another few decades there will be another remake.</fullReview>

A love interest that is neither necessary nor entertaining is patched onto the beginning, and we go downhill from there, falling into plot holes and slipping on greasy non-science and pop philosophy all the way.Nevertheless, it is visually arresting, and Jeremy Irons is wonderful, even in deep make-up mufti.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 'ok' film that will be a little disappointing to fans of the original..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The time machine is an exceptionally...OK film, when it exists purely as a standalone movie, that is.. As a standalone film its a vague adventure/action flick with (the impression of)a mediocre budget and not-quite-professional writers and producers. The concept is novel and has some great scenes but overall is not completely coherent and lacks direction as to what it wants to be. A reasonable family film that's worth a rental at least one time if you're out of things to watch....But as a remake, the film is on the disappointing side of the 'ok' spectrum. The movie seeks to improve on the original 1960 version, and where as it does so with good special effects (albeit it few and far between)good characters and some interesting scenes, in every other case it either doesn't improve at all or exacerbates the issues of the original 2-fold.The films main issues is that it tries to add to the original films foundations with poorly thought out ideas, and this makes the whole thing incoherent. For example, Where as in the original the travelling through time was done because...why not? and Maybe the future holds new possibilities (the actions of an inquisitive mind), the remake unnecessarily creates a love-interest who's objectively nothing more than 1. Filler 2. A shallow vessel for reasons to travel in time.The love interest is brought in 10 minutes into the film, they share a 3 minute scene and then the dies. Cut to several months in the future. Now that he built the time machine he goes backwards *exactly once*, meets her again and she soon dies a second time. Based on that, he travels forwards in time with the question of 'why can't I change the past?' and that question is asked exactly once and shes never thought of again. End of love interest.One might think that the above was an 'in a nutshell' detailing, but unfortunately it isn't. It may well have been a word-for-word from the creators storyboard. There was literally no reason for this character to exist, nor this need for a reason to time-travel, and this is an example of what the remake 'adds' to the original..Also for a film about time travel, we see very little 'legitimate' time travel at all. The main character stops in the future exactly twice before the final half. Once for 5 minutes and once for 50 seconds, before landing in a time where the world has reverted to greenery and tribe people..So wheres the artistic and scientific concepts of the future? Wheres the ideas of future technology? society? buildings? language? The only science-fictiony and star-trek-ish examples we see are within 3 meager scenes. Its incredibly disappointing how little of the 'future' we really got to see.Instead we're treated to a second half of a film based around technologically illiterate forest dwellers who use fire as light and branches as building materials.. Don't get me wrong, I understand that both this and the original are attempting to follow the book, but the creativity opportunities for film were greatly lacking..The last major issue was the second half of the film, almost in its entirety. As said earlier, the film lacks direction and this is where it occurs the most. At some point the film devolves into a cheesy action flick with fighting and choreographed action scenes against generic cgi. The 'bad guy' and his minions were equally generic and their agendas were simplistic. The film ends on an attempted high-note, but the generic standards of the whole second half leave you uncaring with its predictable resulting character accomplishments and new love interest. The end. All very straight forward and lacking imagination. Not much else to say without giving up all of the remaining plot.In a nutshell: The good points:-1. Actors were both believable and were well suited for their respective parts. 2. The Special effects for the time travelling were excellent. 3. The idea(s) behind the few future scenes were interesting 4. When they're not trying to 'add' to the film, it is a reasonable homage to the original and worth a watch at least one time. 5. As a stand-a-lone, its not terrible, and there are great scenes at times.The bad points:- 1. What it adds is pointless, genetic and makes the film feel rushed and unguided. 2. Creative opportunities were missed in plenty of obvious places. 3. The second half of the film turned into a generic action flick, almost as if the two halves were different films. 4. Its just an 'ok' remake, it could have been a lot better.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What starts out as a period piece (although set in NYC instead of the traditional England) and the set up for what we know is coming since this story is very famous and been done several times in film, quickly turns into over an hour of wasted time and hilariously bad acting in the Morlock/Eloi time frame.What could have been was not, a weak effort.Tons of bad science and plot holes:The hologram librarian is for some reason sarcastic and testy with people, I'm not sure who would build such a thing to serve people in a library. He actually rolls his eyes at one point.The Eloi can speak English even though that is a dead language 800k years old and Mara amazingly learned it from letters on stones but has a perfect modern American accent. She says they all learn it when they are young and then forget it? Everyone? Why would such a small group of people have two languages? And why didn't they learn it from the Vox?If the kid knows where the Vox is why haven't they used it since they speak English to learn the entire history of the world and how to make guns and airplanes and every other invention ever made?The hologram librarian also has emotions which makes zero sense. He is depressed and angry, why would we invent a computer who has emotions? I'm also not sure how it is still powered after 800k years, if it were self powered then that would sure solve the worlds energy issues.The Morlock are wild violent creatures up top but are industrious workers down below. And I'm not sure how the Über-Morlock knows what happened to the Moon 800k years ago since all history was wiped out.And how did Alexander know that blocking the wheels of the time machine would turn it into a bomb capable of vaporizing all the Morlocks?</fullReview>

The special effects are pretty good and the creature designs of the Morlocks are spot on.Simon Well's film is about a professor named Alexander who decides to build a time machine so he can save his fiancé from death. But after it was deemed impossible, Alexander heads to the distant future where he is to save mankind.The acting is actually pretty cheesy and hammy. But Guy Pearce does an okay job in his role. I liked Jeremy Irons. His makeup is pretty good and reminds me greatly of the villain from Hellboy ll.Overall, this is a decent sci-fi film. The special effects are good and the story itself is not bad. I find it pretty ironic how the great grandson of H.G Wells would direct a film based off his novel. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Time Machine" was your typical, Hollywood sci-fi movie. An inventor creates a machine that allows him to travel back and forth through time. Eventually, he comes to find himself in the distant future, and discovers a people as much in need of guidance as he is in need of a place to fit in. Sadly, Wells feels compelled to add an extraneous and unnecessary storyline concerning repeated trips into the past to save a young woman from dying. Not only does it add nothing to the story, it serves to highlight the paradoxical nature of the central theme. Ask anyone who has written or filmed a time travel story, and they will tell you that if there is one thing you do not do, it is give the audience a chance to think about, much less dwell upon, the paradoxical nature of what they are seeing. Another problem is that too much material is presented in too little screen time. The 1960 film was a lean ninety-nine minutes because it made good use of the time it had. This 2002 remake is ninety-six minutes long because plot threads are discarded so fast that development is an impossibility.Not helping matters is the casting. A soap opera actor is simply not the right person to credibly portray this unconventional hero. Jeremy Irons does his best with a terribly-written part, and it is quite amusing to see him eat the scenery. I think his agent had a lot of explaining to do after The Time Machine premiered. One of the few touches that is comparably brilliant with the 1960 film is Orlando Jones as Vox, a virtual history teacher who fills the hero in on the way the world of the eight thousandth century came to be. I prefer the ring-spinning sequence in the 1960 film for its creepy and impersonal atmosphere, but the Jones-Pearce exchanges have a certain human touch going for them. Which you prefer will obviously depend a lot on how you like to have your exposition delivered. Had the rest of the film been made like this, we would be judging it on its own merits rather than how it fails compared to its august predecessor.</fullReview>

The special effects are all excellent, as is the set design. The Morlocks are, broadly, well realised (especially movement) although the faces don't entirely convince.The cast, too, is good, if not outstanding (Guy Pearce's traveller is excessively anguished and over-earnest, and Jeremy Iron's urbane albino mutant strays into pantomimery). Samantha Mumba's Mara is a spirited move up from Yvette Mimieux's Weena, and this further move away from the novel is likely to be the reason why they gave her a name change.It is pleasing to see Alan Young again, the sole cast member to appear in both films,40 years apart.The variations in plot line all work dramatically, and the film as a whole is good fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this at the cinema when it was released and thought it disappointing. Like others, I remembered my love for the HG Wells novel, and the brilliant 1960 George Pal interpretation. But, 8 years on, I watched it again on TV and was much more impressed. There was a lot more homage to Wells and Pal than I detected the first time,even a cameo by Alan Young who was so good as Philby back then, and the performances and effects now seemed super too. Jeremy Irons is always great, but this was might actually be his finest achievement - not the makeup, certainly, but the way he turned a rather hokey role into a masterful requiem for the human race. No other living actor could have done as well and this time around I found it very moving. Samantha Mumba spoke for humanity in an entirely different way, and almost made me forget how fetching Yvette Mimeux was in 1960. Guy Pierce I felt wasn't right; maybe it was just that he reminds me too much of Cliff Richard, or perhaps it was the fact that Rod Taylor was so perfect in the role. The plot was fairly true to Wells in spirit, except for the contrived ending with no scientific or even pseudo-scientific basis for the way jamming the machine produced a convenient time warp that wipes out the Morlocks. I'm not usually so fickle, but what would have been a 2 or 3 rating eight years ago is now an 8 for me. Mind, you, much of the credit goes to Wells, the greatest visionary the world has ever known.</fullReview>

Wells who wrote the original The Time Machine book on which the original The Time Machine (1960) film was based &amp; it is in fact the 1960 film that producer John Logan's script is based upon here rather than Wells original literally source. While all three share the same basic story &amp; ideas this remake adds the subplot about Alexander's fiancé Emma being killed &amp; that's the reason he invents a time machine rather than just because he is clever &amp; he can. The script is a mixture of sci-fi, action adventure &amp; drama none of which really grabbed me or engaged me that much, sure there are a few pretty special effects, a few nice action scenes &amp; the moment when Alexander's question is answered regarding why he can't save Emma is actually quite intelligent &amp; makes sense it never really captured my imagination &amp; I was never really moved by it either. The time travel aspects of The Time Machine feel very similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992) in the sense you can't change the past but at the same time the future is not set only The Time Machine isn't anywhere near as good a film as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The character's are alright although I thought Guy Pearce just looked too young to be a brainy scientist capable of inventing a time machine &amp; there's never any real explanation behind it's mechanics either as it's like one moment there's no time machine the next he has invented &amp; made one &amp; it works perfectly. I reckon the Back to the Future trilogy offer far more thrills, laughs, excitement &amp; general entertainment value than The Time Machine ever does &amp; while I will stop short of calling it a bad film since it moves along at a decent pace, tells a reasonable story &amp; has it's moments I wouldn't call it brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a cheeky little reference to the book &amp; original film which are both name-checked here.The benefit this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects &amp; in particular CGI which leads to scenes of time rapidly passing around Alexander in his time machine complete with huge buildings being built, new ridges, canyons &amp; mountains being formed &amp; a elaborate pan back which ends up in space as we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon. The effects work is good, there are one or two moments that look a little below par but generally speaking the effects are good. I saw The Time Machine on telly &amp; the station playing it badly pan and scanned it so the left &amp; right edges of the frame were cut off the screen thus cutting off part of the year on Alexander's time machine dial so I actually didn't know what year he went to. Apparently director Gore Verbinski took over the last eighteen days of filming as Wells was suffering from 'extreme exhaustion' while the IMDb says that the time machine itself was the biggest &amp; most expensive prop ever built for a film at that point which I find hard to believe &amp; Guy Pearce broke a rib during a fight scene but like a trooper carried on.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 the production values are high with a lovingly recreated period New York &amp; good effects work although amazingly The Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar for best make-up but lost out to Frida (2002). The acting is mixed, Jermey Irons puts in a good performance in a terrible make-up job that has him looking like a reject from a Lord of the Rings film while singer Samantha Mumba makes her big screen debut here &amp; is simply terrible although Guy Pearce is quite good &amp; fairly likable.The Time Machine isn't a particularly bad film or a particularly good one, just a somewhat unremarkable one that is watchable &amp; passes an hour and a half but not much else. Watch Back to the Future (1985) again instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Time Machine seemed to die a quick death at movie theaters when it was released back in '02, and this is a shame. I happened across some of it in the middle of the night a few months back and was intrigued. I just saw all of it and came away somewhat impressed. Just read Ebert's scornful review to get an idea of the negative press that must have sunk this film. True, nothing we see is really plausible, but.... HELLO! This is a fantasy. It is science fiction. Well, thankfully the science really doesn't matter here.The story is somewhat based on the H.G. Wells book of the same name. Apparently the director of record here is his great grandson. I have never read the book, but it would seem unnecessary when it comes to understanding this film. Guy Pierce plays a young scientist who designs a time machine, hoping to go back a few years and save his fiancé who dies in a mugging. Using Einstein's theories, he does so. But no sooner does he think he has saved the woman, than he discovers that fate may not have any regard for our scientific accomplishments. In order to figure out why this is, Pierce next travels into the future. First into the year 2030, and eventually some 800,000 years later! What he finds has happened to humanity is enough to make anyone shiver. It seems that humans have destroyed the moon, and this eventually led to great problems for earth. Humanity ended up splitting into two subspecies. The Eloi, who are brown-skinned and peaceful as any romanticized depiction of Native Americans. And the Morlocks, an underground-dwelling and ferocious bunch who feed on the Eloi. Jeremy Irons is their supreme leader! He is the most advanced creature in the film. He can even read the minds of those he encounters. The rest of the film deals with Pierce settling in with the Eloi and trying to free them from the Morlocks. All of this in just over 95 minutes!! The film has many, many good things going for it. The special effects of time travel will be what you remember the most. Watching the earth change around Pierce while he sits inside the protective cocoon of his machine is quite a sight. The machine itself is an impressive creation rumored to be one of the most expensive movie props ever built. The acting is terrific in most cases, too. Guy Pierce has never quite become a huge star, but he has the talent to be one. And look out for Orlando Jones (the original 7up "up yours" guy) who plays a helpful hologram who has all kinds of needed information for the characters. The music is better than average, and the locations (past and future) always look good or even frightening.I'd be the first to tell you to give this movie a look. It isn't too long, and it is full of interesting happenings. And keep in mind that it is a fantasy. You aren't supposed to believe it for a minute. Honestly, have you ever seen a film about time travel that you thought was in any way plausible?? I though not. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply, Good Movie! Good Music! Actually a very nice composition! All the time, in time machine related stuff we get to see almost the same things, like somebody goes into past or future and all that... But I think this movie was different! The story starts with a scientist often criticized by people near him... They don't like him, think he is crazy except his gf! But he succeeds to make a time machine. He travels into future, 2027 (I guess) and likes the future and makes a robot friend! Curious to know he travels a little more, to 2037, and this is where the real thing begins! The MOON has broken down and fallen on earth (half of it). Can you imagine such a creative idea? I liked it. People are going here and there trying to save themselves and in quick hesitation he loses his consciousness and time machines takes him thousand of years ahead. Ice Ages have passed and when he wakes up, entirely new world! What's interesting now is, two breeds of human have developed, normal humans (like us) and humans went underground because Earth couldn't support all humans after moon broke down. Another great twist in the story. This is about the story. Then he travels some years ahead (maybe centuries) and founds in a whole new world, where minds of humans have been captured a superhuman, the leader of Underground humans! Another great idea! But second half has simply very sweet music composition! A very nice supplement to a wonderful storyline!Good work by all the leading actors, Guy Pearce, Samantha Mumba, Jeremy Irons and Orlando Jones as robot, all are great!Sweet, simple, creative and refreshing! Well, actually a nice story, very different one!Take my words, you won't get disappointed, you'll feel refreshed after watching it!I had watched it on Star Movies 2-3 years back and it's still fresh in my mind!8/10 thanx vipin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been one of my favorite movies, I'm not sure why it has such a low rating. The thing I like most about this movie is that Alexander is so dedicated to saving his fiancé, but is not able to do to the fact that she does not exist out of her time.Some points of this movie are very interesting in some of them you must think a lot about. One part that really stumped me was when he went back into time to save his fiancée wouldn't he see himself there? Or when he wanted to use the Time machine again wouldn't the Time machine already be there (when he wanted to go to the future)...well it's only a movie but a great movie one of my favorites! Even though this movie didn't really make that much money, and wasn't that popular it still fascinates me many ways, I'm always thinking about time travel now how someone could travel through time if it's possible. The thing that really surprise me is that the movie cost around $120 million (both including advertisement and the movie itself)and it only made around $95 million...Well sometimes these things happen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a modernized version of The Time Machine.In 1960 we saw the first movie made of the masterly novel by H.G.Wells.The original movie was great and this new one is good, not great, but good.Much better than said.It doesn't follow the original novel step by step, not at all, but it doesn't matter to me.Guy Pearce plays Alexander Hartdegen whose sweetheart Emma (Sienna Guillory) gets killed.Therefore he builds a time machine, so he can go back in time to prevent it from happening.But he can't prevent it, Emma dies anyway.So he travels into the future looking for the answer.Soon he finds himself 800,000 years into future.He discovers that everything has changed.The director of The Time Machine (2002) is Simon Wells, who happens to be the great-grandson of H.G.Wells.Guy Pearce does good work in the lead.Samantha Mumba, who's also known as a singer, is better than expected playing Mara, the Eloi girl.Her kid brother Omero plays Kalen.The great actor Jeremy Irons plays Über-Morlock.Mark Addy plays Alexander's friend David Filby.Phyllida Law is the strict Mrs. Watchett.Orlando Jones is Vox, the library guy of the future.This movie may not be making any movie history, but it is highly entertaining.And also very interesting.Especially when Alexander goes for his first trip and he finds Emma still alive.Timetravelling is the most fascinating theme.The movie does very good work building the 19th century world, and also the world of the future.Just like Mr. Wells did in his novel back in 1895.</fullReview>

When the girl he loves is tragically killed, Alexander is determined to go back in time and change the path. Testing his theories, the time machine is hurtled 800,000 years into the future. He he discovers a terrifying new world. Instead of mankind being the hunter, they are now the hunted, with him stuck in the middle.I was optimistic about 'The Time Machine' as i didn't know what i was going to expect. What i got, was an enjoyable adventure through time. The story (adapted from the noval) was easy to follow, and the film was at good pace and really brought the world of the past and future to life. The effects were amazing, as well as the make-up. Jeremy Irons looked menacing as the Über-Morlock. This was a fun film, in which the whole family will enjoy."Welcome. How may i help you?"

		<fullReview>I found the time Machine to be entertaining enough, though it had to squeeze a lot into its "Time" frame. The acting was very good and the main actors were very believable in their rolls. It is not very far from the original version in some ways, just more currant in the filming abilities of todays technology. Compared to a lot of movies made today in terms of science fiction this movie is at least enjoyable and the violence factor was kept to a minimum which is always a pleasant surprise since most adventure movies contain too much violence and not enough content. There is really no sexual content other than the female leads see through blouse which is not really that revealing and covered by her hair. So sit back and relax, grab some popcorn and keep an open mind. Just remember to keep track of "TIME".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of general romance and never read this book, you will probably enjoy this. If you are a fan of the book, stick with the George Pal version. Although it was a bit different from the book, it is still the closest and still rules by far. Why is it that movie makers always think that they can make a story better than the original loved material? There were so many great visuals that could have made this version even better than the original 1960 version, but the script was just crap. The whole idea of the book was totally lost. The funniest part is, this movie was exactly what the book warned of. It is so dumbed down that they needed to add a bad love story to make it into an even worse romance novel. The funniest thing is, when they were promoting this movie they were saying, repeatedly, how much closer it was to the book than any other version with some slight updates. Was I a sucker. If that was the case I would have embraced it, but that was a flat out lie. If I had known what this movie was in advance I might have enjoyed it, but the promoters flat out lied and sent my expectations against them. Why they do this, I can only guess. Do they think that no one knows how to read anymore so we will accept whatever they say? That is so insulting. The billions of people who have read it are then expecting that story. Why call it "The Time Machine" then? Do as Blade Runner did. Change the name and say "based on this original work". This is as much an H. G. Wells story as the hacked War of the Worlds from Spielberg. Although this story was more believable than that garbage was (Spielberg should stick to comedies and cartoons), it was still a huge let down to me and every fan of the book I have talked to who has seen it. All that said, there actually were some really neat things in this. Visually, this was just amazing. Costumes and FX were just stunning. The acting was okay, nothing great but nothing bad. Same with the general direction. The FX crew was just amazing though. The Morlocks were fantastic and what you would expect a devolved to almost cro-magnon race to look like. How the Eloi lived and looked was also very well thought out along with other visions of the future and past. But a pretty picture doesn't make a great movie. The score I gave this was strictly for these pieces. As for the story, I've read better from children who can't make a complete sentence. General Hollywood schlock with no actual value. They need to start finding writers who have mentally passed middle school.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This Film Still OK Despite Not Being Faithful To Wells' Original Story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember going along to the cinema when it was released, full of anticipation of what modern technology in films could do with a story like The Time Machine. I exited the cinema totally disappointed. Surely Simon Wells couldn't allow such a thing to happen to his great grandfather's novel? Where was Victorian London? Where was the after dinner experiment with the model? Where was the real time-traveller? Just details from the original, but it conjured up a flavour which the modern film totally rejected. Even the great political lesson of the widening of the gulf between the haves and have-bots was overlooked. Rather naive and strange in these supposedly enlightened times.And yet, just a year later I was buying the DVD. Make no mistake, the novel is a wonderful creation and the 1960 film is a vastly simplified, yet colourful rendition of the book. And yet, I really like this version too. Admittedly, I have got over the shock of seeing H.G.Wells' story torn to shreds, and now I just like the film for it's own ends. It's no masterpiece, but there are some simply stunning pieces. The time travelling sequences are magical; hugely aided and abetted by a music soundtrack that is quite the best thing about the film. You'll be humming this one for a long, long time. The acting is actually reasonably good throughout. I thought Guy Pierce gave a pretty good account of himself, and Sienna Guillory makes for a excellently tragic Emma. I liked and was frustrated by Vox (Orlando Jones) simply for the fact that he resembled a latter day Internet so well. The snippet where he asks Alexander if he would like to hear a song from the musical of The Time Machine by Andrew Lloyd-Webber (who although immediately saying NO because it's not what he asked for, gets ignored and he has to hear a rendition) is so reminiscent of present day search engine answers that have almost nothing to do with the enquiry, and yet are almost forced upon the enquirer.There are areas of the screenplay that don't tie together well but, as H.G. would have said, ...take it as a story, what do you think of it? Well I find that I do enjoy The Time Machine as a story, and if I want the real thing I read the book. There's always the Wells estate authorised sequel, The Time Ships by Stephen Baxter that could be filmed. Now that would make an excellent film. Just don't play around with that one too much eh, filmmakers?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exhibit A in the case that Hollywood is too remake-happy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are a lot like sequels to Hollywood. With a little bit of work on a new script and some updated effects, a pre-existing audience can be made to cough up a little more cash on an idea they saw executed a few years ago. It's a pity that nobody in Hollywood seems to have the sense to say "this idea is not going to work", because it could have saved a lot of unnecessary grief on this remake. I do not know whether director Simon Wells believed his relation to author H.G. Wells necessarily qualified him to remake an adaptation, but he has proved himself very wrong here. The biggest problem with this update, in a nutshell, can be stated as sometimes, less is a whole lot more. Where George Pal glossed over small details in the late Wells' novel, Simon Wells embellishes them, and in so doing, highlights the reasons why Pal left them on the cutting-room floor. Perhaps the most embarrassing part is the use of Jeremy Irons as an über-Morlock, waxing all philosophical as the leader of a race that is meant to represent regressed humanity.For the most part, the structure of the story is the same. An inventor creates a machine that allows him to travel back and forth through time. Eventually, he comes to find himself in the distant future, and discovers a people as much in need of guidance as he is in need of a place to fit in. Sadly, Wells feels compelled to add an extraneous and unnecessary storyline concerning repeated trips into the past to save a young woman from dying. Not only does it add nothing to the story, it serves to highlight the paradoxical nature of the central theme. Ask anyone who has written or filmed a time travel story, and they will tell you that if there is one thing you do not do, it is give the audience a chance to think about, much less dwell upon, the paradoxical nature of what they are seeing. Another problem is that too much material is presented in too little screen time. The 1960 film was a lean ninety-nine minutes because it made good use of the time it had. This 2002 remake is ninety-six minutes long because plot threads are discarded so fast that development is an impossibility.Not helping matters is the casting. A soap opera actor is simply not the right person to credibly portray this unconventional hero. Jeremy Irons does his best with a terribly-written part, and it is quite amusing to see him eat the scenery. I think his agent had a lot of explaining to do after The Time Machine premiered. One of the few touches that is comparably brilliant with the 1960 film is Orlando Jones as Vox, a virtual history teacher who fills the hero in on the way the world of the eight thousandth century came to be. I prefer the ring-spinning sequence in the 1960 film for its creepy and impersonal atmosphere, but the Jones-Pearce exchanges have a certain human touch going for them. Which you prefer will obviously depend a lot on how you like to have your exposition delivered. Had the rest of the film been made like this, we would be judging it on its own merits rather than how it fails compared to its august predecessor.Getting back to how the film feels too cramped for its own good, a pertinent quote is when the hero tells us he could come back a thousand times and see the woman he is trying to save die a thousand different ways. Jeremy Irons later explains that this woman's death is set in stone, because otherwise our inventor would have no reason to build his machine. These paradoxes keep spinning about in the plot without any sort of attempt to divert us from the fact that the hero is like a child who wants to control the fate of everything around him. One could interpret the ending of George Pal's film as the hero deciding to leave behind that which he cannot change and embrace that which he can. If this point was what H.G. Wells intended to be in his story, then it was obviously lost upon Simon Wells. Simon spends so much time trying to conform a story that is both timeless and yet rooted in the time of writing to modern ideas that he loses much of what makes the novel a classic that may well be read into the year 800,000 and beyond.Adding insult to injury is the attempt to tie in the hero's experiments with Einsteinian theory. Einstein had many ideas that turned out to be incorrect, but had he lived into the twenty-first century, he would have found quite a perverse delight in cataloguing insultingly stupid film physics, of which The Time Machine circa 2002 has an overload. The 1960 film had our inventor travelling through the ages in order to witness first-hand the proof that time does indeed change space. This version seems to just have man's endless quest to have a beautiful woman to bounce upon as its primary motivator. Not that this isn't a noble motivation for some things, but it sucks as a motivation for experiments that could alter the very fabric of the universe. Roger Ebert also inadvertently sums up another brilliant facet of the ring sequence from the 1960s film: "Convenient, that when humankind was splitting into two different races, both its branches continued to speak English." So much in this film is left unsupported or unexplained that it is literally a small wonder that it makes sense.I gave The Time Machine, circa 2002, a three out of ten. Even if it were the first-ever production of a film based on H.G. Wells' novel, it would be a sad excuse for a film. With its 1960 predecessor to be compared to, it is a sad day for humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Words Sum It Up - Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine is a great movie. Don't listen to most of the other people that over-analyze movies. If they haven't figured out that movies are made for enjoyment and not to be analyzed (at least not the first time you watch it), then they have no place commenting. If you get too deep into the technicalities of time travel, you'll find the movie ultimately unenjoyable.However, there is still hope. If you see the movie for what it is (an action/adventure movie), you'll find that it starts off slowly and beautifully outlines what exactly drives the already extremely intelligent Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) to spend the next four years building a working time machine. Upon successfully going back in time, Alexander realizes that he can't save his fianceé, and so decides to go into the future all the way to 2030.Ultimately, this second 'time shift' doesn't do much for the story besides set us up for future events. Alexander decides he won't find answers, even though he's jumped so far ahead in time that the sights and technology have changed dramatically. Remember the advertisement for the lunar mining operation? When Alexander decides to jump ahead again (originally, he decides to jump another hundred years), an explosion nearly throws him from his chair and forces him to slow down and stop in 2037, where the mining operation has more or less made the moon start to disintegrate as a result of the failed operation. Well, of course, that's not good. After encountering a brief scuffle with the police of that time, he's back into the time machine and through accident, manages to knock himself out for a short while while the time machine throws him forward 800,000 years into the future.Sit back and watch as the scenery changes. It's quite amazing, I thought.Initially, when Alexander awakens, he barely stops the time machine and is apparently picked up by the Elois, a tribe of surface-dwelling humans. At first, it seems that no-one in the tribe understands him, but we learn later that they all know at least some of the English language. Many people don't quite understand why this is, but it's later pointed out that it's tradition to teach the English language (they call it the Stone language). What more do you need to know? I won't spoil the ending, however. You can read other comments for ending spoilers. Grab a copy of this movie and watch it, or better yet, rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not true to the book, but it's quite emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Must say i'm a massive fan of the book and the previous film and that this film certainly did not disappoint. OK, its quite a bit different to the book, you know the bit about the moon collapsing??? But who cares. However, if they had to change the book, they could at least have focused on the not too distant future a bit more. That would have been a lot more interesting, about 2100 ish. Lets talk the emotional aspect. Its sad that Mr. Hartegen's wife-to-be gets gunned down in the park and is bundled over by some sort of carriage and its also sad that the prof gets stuck with the eloi forever. I take a mark away from the film, not for not being true to the book but for the idea for the climax and the part with Jeremy Irons. Talking actors, Samantha Mumba doesn't do too bad, whilst Irons does another decent job as well as a very well cast Pearce. I also picked out another well acted part, albeit very small in the form of the robber (Max Baker). His small performance was very effective. So to conclude, if you know a good film from a bad, you will find it easy to point out this one's excellence.</fullReview>

The acting isn't very convincing, the plot itself is rather thin on the ground and you can't help but feel that the whole thing wasn't so much a film but rather an exercise in special effects and such like.About the only redeeming feature is that fact it's that "perfect" length for a Hollywood film. 90 minutes. Once it's all done and dusted, you can't feel as though you've wasted too much time on it.I won't lie - the effects are quite nice but really they're just fancy redoings of what one might see in the classical redoing and this has none of the charm or class that had. It's straight from the cookie-cutter and it shows, in short unless you particularly want to switch your brain off for the better part of 90 minutes, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Sci-fi/Adventure/Action about a man named Alexander Hartdegan(Guy Pearce,Memento) who travels 800,000 years into the future.To find that civilization has started all over.But now the race of man has split into two different species one is close to what we look like now.And the other is a creature that is extremely strong and treats the other race like cattle.Guy Pearce(Alexander Hartdegan)gave a horrible performance i mean he had his moments but it was like he was in a community theater play it got really annoying.Actually the acting all together was horrible i would have to say that the only one who gave even a OK performance was Mark Addy(David Filby).The directing reached the medium but not even close to passing it.There were some really cool special effects especially when he was traveling through time.The storyline was a little out of wack but clever i suppose you could say.The screenplay was horrible i mean no real content at all.Best actor/actress-Mark Addy To far out there for me i can buy the time travel but the rest was ridiculous-Jake Hyden I gave this movie a 4 out of 10 Rated-(PG-13) for intense sequences of action violence.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The strangest thing about this film is that they dragged out the great, great, great grandson (or something) of HG Wells to direct this thing; strange, since it only bears a passing resemblance to the original book. The 1960 version was closer to the HG Wells original vision, especially in its sense of wonder and excitement. Spoilers here. This version also commits the cardinal error of making the Eloi a strong, independent and resourceful race. In both the book and, to a certain extent the original film, they are portrayed as innocent and vulnerable. This explains why they meekly allow the Moorlocks to turn them into fast food. Some religious mumbo jumbo, which is never explained, is the excuse for their lack of resistance in this film.So there's not much to recommend it really: the CGI are okay, but no longer surprising, the plot has little momentum, Guy Pearce is workmanlike, Samantha Mumba is very pretty but can't really act, Orlando Jones is good with what little he has to do, and as for dear old Jeremy Irons?you can almost imagine him exploding,' Get this awful make-up of me and give me my cheque now!'. My own recommendation is to watch the George Pal version. It's fun and better acted. Interesting that; a film that is 40 years older than this one, yet is much more intelligent and has far more inventive special effects. Now there's a time conundrum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie makes one want to leave the theater. Some dorks in college thought up some great set design ideas and decided to make a thrown-together movie out of it. Simon Wells was disrespectful enough to take his grandfathers wonderful story and smear it across a film with some mediocre actors and a pathetic rewrite. He added in a bunch of lame plot elements, including a creepy super villain with no point. H.G. Wells' original story will never be the same when thoughts of it will be interrupted by this pathetic mistake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Enjoyable Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the previous movies made based on H G Wells classic book, i would say this is on a par with those if not better and uses many scenes from the original movies(obviously recreated) such as the scene with the clothing shop window dummies changing through the various styles depending how far he goes and the general look of the time machine as well as the world changing around him as he goes forward again obviously using new technology this looks brilliant.In this remake Guy Pearce takes the lead role and delivers well.On the night he is going to propose to his fiancee she is killed by a mugger and he thinks that he can fix this by travelling back and changing the past, but after this proves wrong he decides to travel forward in time in search of answers but again finds little in the way of comfort until an accident in the future knocks him out and thrusts him forward until his time machine basically runs out of digits where he is found by the people of the time and told of the problems which came before them.At this point in the film pearce goes from a morner to a sort of action hero and when the 2nd species emerge from underground he takes it upon himself to try and help and when one of the people is caught he goes in search of her and is confronted by the controller of the morlocks (jeremy irons) who plays his role to perfection as always and is given the chance to return to his own time and forget what has seen.It is at this point in the movie where pearce believes he has no future in his own time and makes the sacrifice by destroying his time machine to start a new life in the future which as you would expect all works out in end. The end sequence is a tear jerker as pearces house keeper accepts that he isnt coming back and leaves for a new job with his best friend,the accompanying soundtrack is perfect and well crafted and ever musical section fits the scene it represents.A great film, although many people have said its a mess and a waste of space thats their opinion and not mine so :P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disgrace to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "modern" 2002 version of the original book and film is an utter disgrace. I have seen this film twice, once in the theater and once again last night just to make sure I wasn't poorly judging the movie. It is safe to say they blew it! Hello...the title of the film is "The Time Machine" so one would think they would elaborate on the subject of time travel...right?...WRONG! In less then 10 minutes he travels 80 thousand years into the future. In the book and the original film, half of the movie is dedicated to the subject. In the original film, there is a slow build up, he slowly travels into the future stopping along the way to view World War One then again to see the nuclear destruction of the planet. In this version they take no time to actually give the viewer a feeling for what it would really be like to time travel, something the original does quite nicely. So to this version I say Balderdash and Poppycock! I'll stick with the original version and keep my fond memories of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite disappointed in this film. All the charm and fascination of the 1960 version are completely lost. Remember the opening and closing scenes of the original film? A snowy 1900 night; friends invited for dinner; clocks ticking in a warm house; whimsical background music; this start of an engrossing adventure was the art of film making at its best. Sure the new time machine had more bells and whistles, but it only shows that modern special effects are no substitute for good writing and direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often silly and rushed, but highly enjoyable nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** 1/2 out of ****The Time Machine caught a lot of flack from critics, most of them finding it a silly, needless remake of a sci-fi classic. And while I agree with some of their complaints, by the end, The Time Machine successfully (though certainly not completely) won me over with its mix of awe-inspiring sci-fi and tense adventure.Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a mathematics professor in the late 19th century who's just about to propose to his beautiful fiancée (Sienna Gullory). But on the night, he proposes to her, she's shot and killed by a mugger. Distraught, Hartdegen spends the next four years building a time machine so he can return to the very night she died. But when he does go back in time, the results are the same. She survives the mugger, but is killed in an even more horrific manner.Grief-stricken once again, Hartdegen comes to the conclusion she will always die no matter how he tries to save her. Not knowing why, he believes the answer is in the future, which ultimately propels him 800,000 years to the future, where technology no longer exists and humanity's fate is more terrifying than Hartedgen could have imagined.There's a lot to like in The Time Machine. Despite a somewhat stilted beginning that belongs more in a romantic comedy, once the time traveling begins, the film only engages more and more momentum as it moves along. The subplots that are added here and there (most particularly how the moon was destroyed) are fascinating, each one capable of making another film entirely out of such ideas.And it seems there lies the major problem. The film is extremely rushed. In what it should have been an intriguing, tense, and perhaps somewhat leisurely paced adventure turns out to be a short (albeit fast-paced) 96-minute ride. Director Simon Wells should have spent a bit more time exploring each of the future worlds Hartdegen visited, rather than simply giving us brief teases.The film has other problems, much of it pertaining to logic (and not logic applied to time travel, which would be pretty lame to complain about, since it would make the entire notion impossible). I'd rather not give anything away, so I'll give a spoiler warning here. There's a scene where Hartdegen meets the head Morlock (the people living underground), played by Jeremy Irons. This morlock happens to be telepathic, but Hartdegen manages to trick him anyway. Then there's the finale, which somehow features Hartdegen and his female companion climbing up a rather tall cliff in a matter of seconds, when it really would have taken at least half-an-hour to do so.But there are enough winning elements to make this a successful film. As far as science fiction goes, The Time Machine is occasionally awe-inspiring, particularly in two amazing time traveling sequences that showcase eye-popping special effects as the world quickly changes around Hartdegen as he views, like us, with a transfixed fascination.Though some people I know didn't quite like the film's 800,000 year jump in the future, it made for quite a few standout scenes (particularly Pearce's first sight of the Eloi village and later on, his conversation with Irons' character). The film also boasts some energetic action sequences, which are actually quite tense and well-directed, especially the morlock hunt (a sequence that would probably frighten younger children). There's a particularly exhilarating scene where Hartdegen tries to fight a huge morlock single-handedly, and is speedily chased by the creature through the forest and up a wooden tower.As far as performances go, Guy Pearce is quite good as Hartdegen, delivering yet again another memorable turn. Pearce makes this character convincing as both a nerdy scientist and as a physically-capable action hero, no small feat there. Samantha Mumba makes little impression as Pearce's sort-of love interest, coming across a little flat. Admittedly, her good figure kind of took my attention from her acting for a few moments. Jeremy Irons is a standout as the uber-morlock, completely creepy and somehow both over-the-top and restrained at the same time.It's unfortunate The Time Machine isn't all it could have been (these days, that seems to apply to most big-budget studio films), but it's nice to see an inspired and spirited sci-fi adventure that's entertaining. I like good science fiction, and if you're willing to accept some of this film's flaws, you'll probably enjoy this film, too.</fullReview>

That's it. Nothing more. Nothing less.The movie wasn't a total loss. I really enjoyed the special effects. Since this is the movie was made in 2002, people will demand CGI. Since people nowadays have no imagination, they want CGI. I have to admit the special effects were very good.The Morlocks. Come on. In the story they are supposed to be afraid of the light! Night dwelers! What is the sad excuse for the Morlocks? They look like crap!Did he REALLY need to put in a "Senior" Morlock?! Where does that fit the story?And the lead role...UGLY.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing about good science fiction is that it uses the framework of a story about some advance in science and the ramifications thereof to provide some education about the nature of the human condition. In the case of H.G. Wells novel "The Time Machine," there is a lesson to be learned about the artificial class division of the human race. This lesson is carried, more or less intact, into George Pal's film version. But it is utterly lacking in Simon Wells' version. The depiction of the upper class becoming so dependent upon the labor class that they are as helpless children is morphed into a story of beautiful aboriginines, living in harmony with nature.By the way, what is the exact evolutionary advantage to having a brain that doesn't fit inside your skull? I mean, really. Part of this guy's brain is not only not protected by hard bone, it's acually exposed to open air!Unfortunately, it very easy to forgive these things when a movie is this much fun. Plus, the hero got to fall in love with two women, each the loveliest of her era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Warning! Plot Spoilers Ahead!**Science fiction admittedly isn't always supposed to add up completely. But at the very least it should make you forget your questions. "Time Machine" is the worst kind of sci-fi. Many plot holes and questions, both large and small, pop up throughout the movie, and there is very little to take your mind off those issues.The core problem with this movie is that the two story arcs that should carry it are deeply flawed. The major plot line is Alex's search to answer why he can't change time. Wouldn't a scientist brilliant enough to invent a time machine be smart enough to see the inherent flaw? Going back in time to change something that drove you to invent the device that allowed you to go back in time to change something that...see what I'm getting at? Circular logic. Disappointing that a scientific mind would miss that. The other primary theme is the good versus evil portrayed by the Eloi and Morlocks. The good and evil are not distinctly portrayed. Yes we know which is which, but only by appearances, as in cartoons. Even when Jeremy Irons finally explains everything, we don't care. We don't know any characters well, so we don't have any emotional attachment to anyone. Speaking of Jeremy Irons, he and Orlando Jones appear in the movie simply to explain some of the things that occur. Nothing wrong with a little exposition, but it ought to happen in the flow of the movie, rather than feel as though a timeout is taken for comprehension purposes. Other unanswered questions: What did the purportedly poisonous Morlock darts do? A number of people were shot by them, yet then continued on as usual. How did the time machine cause such a great explosion? Was there an unmentioned atomic bomb built in? Was that the purpose of the Einstein reference? How did Alex and company get to the top of the hill so quickly? They were watching an explosion that they were in the midst of only seconds earlier!? I've seen slow-moving movie explosions, but that was ridiculous. Bottom Line: A time travel movie featuring fearsome creatures should have a wow-factor, or at the very least be fun. "Time Machine" was neither. 3 out of 10 at best. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent and correct flick about time-traveling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the idea of traveling through time. It's a theme that has enchanted me since I was a child. I got amazed with the "Back To The Future" Trilogy and now, years after H.G. Wells wrote one of his best novels, the film adaptation of "The Time Machine" is a reality.While it should be an adaptation from the novel, it's better to consider the film as using the main idea of the book in order to create a decent story and plot. However, it's quite a shame it doesn't succeed with this purpose. The film starts with good atmosphere and brilliant recreation of the end of the 19th century. But after the time-travels go on, the movie evolves into a mixture between "Waterworld" and "Planet of the Apes", filling the action with "cheesyness"...The strong point of the movie are the special effects: when Alexander (Guy Pearce) travels through time he watches the world change, the buildings, the cities, the landscape... the entire earth. Remarkably done, in my opinion.Also the acting is quite good. Guy Pearce does an outstanding performance as Alexander Hartdegen, the time machine's inventor. He did a great acting in "Memento", and now he does it again. Great for him.Special mention to Jeremy Irons, who seems he has been condemned to perform weird and, sad to say it, cheesy characters. Luckly he's a great actor too, so he keeps on his style while performing, though the white long hair and the "Vampire" contact lenses makes him look stupid.I don't understand the bad reviews posted in this site at all. "The Time Machine" is not an academy award winner, but hey, it's a decent movie, with nice SFX, good acting... and, alright I admit it, a cheesy plot too. ^_^ I bet you a $100 you've seen worse films than this one, so give it a try!Worth look! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Diversion- if you can get over a few things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is currently making its way around satellite and I recently saw it for the first time.In general, the film was both enthralling and thought provoking. The plot, although somewhat predictable in some parts, also caused the viewer to contemplate the larger issues of space and time and whether or not it is possible to alter the events of time.As for the story, you have to separate yourself from the book or the original film for a while and evaluate the movie as a single works. I believe when one does so; they will probably find a story worth telling. In order to enjoy this, one must also suspend reality.There were several `very honorable mentions' in this movie. One was the holographic librarian (Vox) played by Orlando Jones, who sets my mind to smoking when he asks, `Do you know what it's like to remember everything?' The other was the Uber-Morlock (a sort of half David Bowie half alien from Signs) played by Jeremy Irons, who makes some very meaningful statements on the ethics of slaughtering people for food.If you are a Sci-Fi nut, and if you can get over the fact that 1) this is not very close to the H.G. Wells book, 2) is not that close to the original film and 3) does not make very convincing explanations of how Alexander travels through time then this film is a great diversion.</fullReview>

That way the audience could get an understanding of how the time machine was invented, who the REAL Eloys and Morlocks were, and how Guy Pearce helped them.

		<fullReview>... almost literally.The 1960's version of the fabulous H.G. Wells book was good in its day, and was a pretty good version of the source material. However, if you're expecting either a remake of the George Pal movie, or a word-for-word translation of the book, look elsewhere.Instead, this movie is an interpretation of the source material (the book) viewed from a slightly different and more contemporary angle. At its heart, the movie is a tragic love story set against a science fiction background, with some fantastic special effects thrown in for good measure. The sight of the crumbling moon alone got my attention!Looking past the usual glitz and glamor, the story is somewhat formulaic (so was the original book, even in its day!), but that's not a condemnation. This is decent escapism and a fun ride even if you don't normally like science fiction. My wife usually hates sci-fi, but loved this movie for the messages about humankind it portrayed (that life goes on). Personally, I loved the ironic twist revealed by Jeremy Irons as the Uber-Morlock that caused Alexander (Guy Pearce) to suddenly look like he was thinking "Now, why didn't I think of that??".The ending is somewhat tragic, but also extremely uplifting. I was impressed and enjoyed it thoroughly. My only complaint? Probably about 20 minutes too short. Oh, but that score... wow is the only word that suffices!</fullReview>

He should have just accepted things the way they were and went back to the 1800's or whatever. I guess that would have been kind of boring though. But the Uber-Morlock definitely needed more screen time. The Morlocks weren't evil, they did what they had to do to survive. The movie's biggest problems were that it only had to memorable scenes(that didn't involve computer generated special effects)- The Morlock's attack on the Eloi and the encounter with the Uber Morlock- and that Guy Pearce didn't seem like the right man for the lead role. That hair style just doesn't work on him. Not nearly as disappointing as Spider-man or Men In Black 2 though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really hadn't wanted to see this movie at all. I was sort of forced to watch it, but in the end I really actually enjoyed it. For some reason I thought it would be a action packed movie with a lot of violence, but that wasn't even the case. It was a sort of sweet film about fate and two people that were meant to be.It starts out in the late 1800's with a sort of rigid, yet carefree guy named Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) who is very much in love with his girlfriend Emma, played by the lovely Sienne Guillory. The movie starts out harmless enough with Alex proposing to his Emma, but yet the audience can sort of sense something is about to happen...well at least thats how I felt.So, Alex and Emma are in a park and he pops the question, she says yes, and then he goes on to give her the engagement ring, a moonstone, oh how romantic. Minutes after this lovey-dovey scene takes place, a homeless looking fellow just seems to appear out of nowhere and demands Alex hand over his wallet and his watch. Immediately Emma hides her hand behind her back where her brand-spankin-new ring is placed on her delicate finger. Of course our wise homeless man knew she had this ring and demanded he give it to her. Emma of course puts up a fight and the homeless man tries to attack her to get it from her. Alex then steps in and begs that he doesn't take the ring. The man pulls out a gun and holds it threateningly in his hands. Well then our dear Emma "accidentally" gets shot and the homeless man runs off. The scene ends with Alex holding her in his arms.Then we are taken to about four years later, where we see a depressed and determined looking Alex working on...a time machine! He decides he is going to go to the past and fix everything so he can have his fiance back.Does he succeed in going back? Of course. Does he succeed in saving Emma? Of course not, because fate is already set and she was apparently destined to die. Well then our heroic Alex decides he's going to go into the future and try to find the answer to his question (Why won't the past change?) there. In the future he comes across some very startling discoveries--you know, the typical stuff--the doom of mankind, animals taking over the earth, what not, but the rest...you will have to find out for yourself.Anyway, I enjoyed this film because I thought it made a nice love story, and better yet, a pretty good sci-fi movie as well. The majority of what happens in this film, is of course, very much fiction, but that makes it even more fun. The transitions at the end from the past to the present were beautifully done and the futuristic animals didn't even look too digital.I give this movie 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie. Given, some drawbacks, yet brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine... An evergreen classic penned by the father of science fiction, HG Wells. The movie is an excellent adaptation, although it does not entirely adhere with the story. Innovative changes are brought about in certain parts of the story, mostly for the better. But sadly, some changes spoils the beauty of the movie.The portrayal of every character is quite good. And my thumbs are raised for the director and the VFX crew. The makeup for the darker side of evolution from the land deep under, the Morlocks, is phenomenal. I must confess that when I went to see the movie, all I expected was flamboyant displays of Hollywood's technological foray, in yet another attempt to degrade the quality of another classic story. Granted, the story drifted from Wells' classic theme,. Yet, the magic and spell cast by the movie stands in the limelight by its own right.The speed, versatility, and strength depicted by the villains of the piece, the Morlocks, is shown with remarkable craftsmanship. The novel idea by which they sink to the ground, and the manner in which it is shown, is greatly appreciated. And one particular scene in which our hero, Guy Pearce is chased through the woods is a visual masterpiece, as long as you don't mind biting your fingernails.Although the older movie "The Time Machine", was thoroughly enjoyed and still remains a wonderful depiction of the story, I would definitely recommend this movie for all sci-fi fans and people who just want to go for a thrill ride.However, the twist in the climax is something I did not appreciate. I really would like to comment on that, but far be it from me to reveal the end. Given, the developed storyline has plot holes of it's own. For example, the story revolves around finding why the hero can't change the past, or specifically, save his fiancée, who seems to die off at a fixed time no matter how he tries to alter the circumstances. An obvious solution would be to take off with his fiancée to a time in the past, where they have a guaranteed long life... Or how about taking the fiancée with him to some time in the future, hence skipping that dreaded time? Don't tell me it can't be done. The hero does travel way into the future, way past HIS reasonable lifetime. Also he is said to have invented the machine in a short span of time... four years, I think, as opposed to the character in the book, whose invention was a process motivated by his pure love for science, supplemented by a lifelong quest. I didn't say these are huge shortcomings in the movie. They are just...there.But still, it is quite an entertaining movie and I would score it an easy 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**Despite some differences from the book and the movie, it was pretty good. I can see how the directors wanted to make a conflict that would appeal to todays audiences(with his fiancee and everything). I think the reason he wanted to know so much in the future is because he never had a doubt he couldn't get back. He always knew there would be a way back(Spoiler: until he destroyed it). The film makers didn't want to totally re-make the book, because that's already been done. So they changed it around. Great effects also. I give it two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute motto, lame movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score:3.6 (out of 10)"The Time Machine" is a great example of why I set up my silly little rating system. That which rates movies as the sum of their qualities (including sheer mindless entertainment) assuming that the more a movie does right in individual areas the more it works as a whole and is more likely it is to live on as a classic. Why? Because it gets away from my own personal moods and biases. When I love a movie I want it to rate high, when I hate it I want it to be low, but the system works best for movies like this- those that I just couldn't care less about. Five seconds after you have finished watching this one it will slip out of your head and blend together with a hundred other action/popcorn movie memories. If it were just up to me I'd just write this forgettable thing off as a 1 and be done with it. However, that's unfair. In the scheme of it all there are things in it that, if not done that well, are done mediocre. Meaning in the world of bad movies there's a huge difference between this and, say, "Supernova".So it's not terrible, but it does achieve that great sin that even the dumbest, most contrived of summer special FX flicks don't commit: it's boring. There is exactly one redeeming value to "The Time Machine" in that it delivers a pretty cool and imaginative death scene for the villian. It's quite a scene. I think we need more thought-out death scenes like this one instead of simple gunshots to the head. But other than Guy Pierce's typically wooden, sleepwalking performance, it's hard to actually determine where TTM went wrong. With the exception of a few details (Orlando Jones as the "hip" computer simulation even looks bored with the proceedings) this remake is fairly close to the original. In both spirit and action. I saw the 1060s original long before I saw this one and wasn't knocked out by it either. It occurred to me that maybe The Time Machine story just isn't a very interesting one. The H.G. Wells novel was undeniably a revolution in it's time and place, but I think this is just one of those stories that is never going to translate well on the silver screen. I wonder if there is any way Simon Wells could have made this movie seem good and fresh in today's market and still be true to the original story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had high expectations, it has its moments, but was a bit disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this movie seeing that I am a lover of anything related to time travel, and I'm also a bit of a sci fi fan. Even though there were a lot of things I liked in this movie, I found a few things here that disappointed me.Spoilers here.There was a good lead-up to the time traveller's life in the 1900's and his reason for travelling (even though by viewing other comments it seems that this was not taken from the novel and was adapted for the movie), and I liked the visuals of the construction of a moon colony in the early 21st century and the progression of human civilisation in 2030, even though the computer database seemed a bit ignorant and closed-minded.However, I noticed a lot of holes in the plot. In the travelling time from 2037 to 802701, the time machine moved through time and its surroundings moved through erosion and temperature extremes and other changes in environment, which in my opinion was visually and perceptively fantastic. However, I don't see how the effects over time would allow for parts of New York to be preserved for so long when the surrounding earth was completely wiped away, nor do I see how a computer could last for so long without running out of power or being damaged beyond repair. Also, I don't see how humans could have survived or evolved if humans were apparently wiped off the earth (or at least from New York) due to the destruction of the moon. The movie doesn't point out how humans survived or where they came from and the lead character doesn't seem concerned with this, nor does the movie show any humans from 2037 to 802701. Also, I don't think it's plausible that the English language would have been handed down to descendents for over 800,000 years.I think the movie was far too short as I feel that a lot more could have been explained and questioned and elaborated on in this movie. In a way it sort of inspires me to create my own remake. Even though I like the ideas that were used in this movie, there's a lot of things I would do differently and would add. I wanted to see a lot more of the happenings from the 1900's and beyond to see the perceptions from the moviemakers.If you regard all the holes in the plot and a few weird bits and pieces, this is a fun and interesting movie. If it confuses you or annoys you a bit then don't worry because it's not that long and it's over almost as quickly as it starts. 9/10 for subject matter and perception, 7/10 for plot holes and stuff that just didn't make sense. Overall, 8/10, and I'm being a little generous because I like time travel movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Science Fiction Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie based on a classic novel of science fiction by H G Wells. The novel was written a while ago and still the original idea makes for a good story. There must have been a few additions to the movie that did not occur in the novel, Orlando Jones (from the sci fi comedy, Evolution) makes a satisfying appearance as a time tripping computer hologram.There is plenty of action and drama, but nothing that a pre-teen couldn't handle. The visual effects and makeup are stunning and effective. The musical score was mostly good, although I didn't like the background music for the opening scenes in distant future. We've just heard that stuff too much for it to be suitable in movies.I viewed this movie as a VHS rental.</fullReview>

No more time travelling, just stuck in some boring future primitive setting. It was just like a different movie, like a bad version of The Mummy. I wish he travelled more and changed some events in the past, or see himself in the past, something more exciting. And I wish it focused more on the physics side, explaining how he was actually able to travel in time. Anyway, i give first 35 minutes 8/10, rest of movie -4/10 overall 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was just plain awful! I was expecting a guy to have some great adventures, finding things along the way. Instead, it was really dumb stuff that happened, along with really slow action. First, this scientist of the 19th century encounters a tragic issue, and wants to go back to fix what happened. After a while, he invents the time machine and travels back to attempt to correct the past. After that adventure is over, he goes to 2030 and a STUPID thing happens that was about the dumbest idea for a movie! He then goes 800,000 years into the future. COME ON FOLKS! Do you REALLY think that in the year 802,000 that people would still know how to speak our language? (or still be around for that matter!) Besides, there are the stupidest things that he encounters along the way and almost dies in the process. It's really too dumb for me to tell you what happens. If you are so drop dead bored, then go watch this, but I'd advise you to do something productive with your time! Otherwise, go waste it on garbage like this! FFF-</fullReview>

This film adds (superimposes) a ridiculous Hollywood plot and instills revenge in the main character, a much less noble quality. This is a despicable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome but wanted more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie intrigued me, philosophically, almost as much as the Matrix did. There is so much more that could be explored in this movie. Of course, I am at a disadvantage in that I have not read the book. Perhaps it might not go amiss if I read it...For some reason, I found myself comparing this movie to an episode of Star Trek: TNG. I know, strange... But, the exploration of different topics in this movie where handled in much the same way. In my opinion, this is a negative in a movie. In Star Trek, you know you have 45 minutes to get through the story and issues etc. But a movie? For all intents and purposes, in a movie you have all the time in the world. I think there could have been MUCH more done in this movie with the Morlocks and evolution and that whole ball of wax. But, again, I haven't read the book, so, going on such tangents may not be a part of the original.So, despite that, what a great movie! Very entertaining. There is something about watching glaciers move at high rates of speed that is just cool. It is also a treat to see Jeremy Irons playing a quasi-evil guy. A must see, at least, but, I bought the DVD too.</fullReview>

I didn't really like how they didn't go that much by the book, but it was still good. Though, I think that if you are going to make a movie that comes from a book, then you have to at least follow the book by at least the people that died. I read the book and it's great, but "Mara" (which wasn't really her name in the book) should've died in the movie as she did in the book. Other than that(and a couple other things), it's a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really would like to know why this movie is so hated. I have read a lot of reviewers who said that this is "the stuipidest movie of the year" and things like that. But it remains one of my personal favorites. no, it is not the best movie this year (well, so far mabe) but it is a great film. I acually liked this better then the book. for several reasons. one, this movie explores time travle MUCH more then the book, where time travel was not evan the focal point, just a way for H.G. Wells to show a cultual parralel. In this movie, he goes back and forward for a reason besides that the plot requiers it and see's that every thing we do affects the future adn that changing it causes use to take differnt paths in the future. Second, this movie has a MUCH MUCH better ending then the book. the ending in this had me cheering and smiling at what had happened. the book was extremly depressing and sad. call me crazy, but I don't like endings like that. besides that this is a heck of a good movie, splendidly acted and with jaw-dropping special effects. It also is very intriguing adn has a message just like the original. My favorite sequence is the scene with Jeremy Irons. who plays the Uber-Morlock. yet another ingenuis addition to the original story. he is very cold as he calmly speaks about how this works and how it came to be and brought every thing that confused use and the characters to a close. then they have an extremly well choereographed fight on the time machine. Simon Well's has inherited his great grandfathers genious and updated it in a movie with breathtaking visuals, supurb acting, adn a message that is really great to think about. The best time travel movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie bombed at the box office, I'm going to suggest you see it anyway, for sheer entertainment value alone. Based (in part) on the book by H.G. Wells, and a supposed remake of the 1960's movie, "The Time Machine" is the action packed story of a grief-stricken man, who invents a time machine in hopes of going backwards in time to erase the tragedy that has overtaken his life. Now, I have not read the book and I barely remember the original flick, so don't expect any great comparisons to either one here. What I can tell you about this movie is, taken for sheer entertainment value alone, it's a great ride. The special effects are riveting, the Morlocks are truly scary, and the action well-paced. The film's downfall, however, lies in its ending. It's anti-climatic and although you see it coming you are truly disappointed that it actually ends this way. It's like being on a most exciting roller-coaster only to have the last minutes of the ride do nothing more than drive you around at a slow pace. This movie could have been a contender, if it weren't for the ender. Ha, I just kill myself sometimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good effects, bad acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine is one of those films that focuses solely on its effects. Its concept is to basically make the audience believe that what they see on the screen is real and not some dull fantasy. In the process, the effects tend to erase the emotion of the actors. This film definitely just wants the audience to admire its visual achievements and forget about the actors themselves. Sometimes, this concept is able to work like in such films as Terminator 2 or Star Wars. However, in The Time Machine, the acting is supremely poor with no sense of charisma or emotion and the effects are not good enough for the film to hold together. Guy Pearce gives one of the worst performances of his career and shows very little emotion towards any of the storyline. When his girlfriend dies at the beginning of the film, he hardly sheds a tear. When he is driven into madness because of that incident, he hardly shows madness. The director, Simon Wells (who happens to be the great-grandson of H.G. Wells) picked the wrong man to play Alexander, who seems like a dull and boring professor who is played by a dull and boring actor. The film is supposed to center on a world inhabited by two societies, the Eloi and the Morlocks. However, the film does not exhibit the characteristics of either species and just passes on. Even Jeremy Irons, an Oscar winner, gives a poor performance as the Morlock leader. It is nearly impossible to be scared of this character. The only characteristic that makes him look scary are those nasty bluish eyes of his. Due to the poor acting of this film, you have to pray that the effects are good. I would have to say that they are not good enough for this film but they do overshadow the use of poor acting. If Mr. Wells was looking down on us from heaven right now, he would be dissappointed at his great-grandson for creating a mediocre adaptation of his own work. Lenny's Grade: **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any relationship between this movie and H G Well's excellent book and the earlier 1960 movie by the same name is purely accidental and unintentional. This movie changes the plot and ending. The only thing in common with the original is that it involves a time machine and there are morlocks in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thought-provoking study of reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most sobering films I've seen since "Dark City" (1998; Alex Proyas) and "The Thirteenth Floor" (1999, Josef Rusnak), "The Time Machine" is more than simply entertainment; it's a thought provoking look at the concept of reality.When the film begins, we think nothing of the concept of time, except that it's constantly moving forward a fraction of a second at a time. But after the plot of the film switches to using the time machine and moves foward in time, I was forced to think, "Okay, so if he's moving forward in time, that must mean that his lifetime had to have already occurred and is now in history books, right?"And when the film takes us 800,000 years into the future to a post-apocalyptic society, my concept of reality was thrown out the window. At the same time as wrenching my mind, the film managed to make the story very entertaining, although the predatory race of humanoids is quite beyond the stretches of believability.I rated the film a "7" because it shows great potential to expand on the concepts of time travel and its implications on different layers of time. But my rating wasn't higher because that 800,000 year jump was simply too incredible. Overall, though, a well-made film. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nevermind the story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a rare case in which I read the book first, then saw the old movie, and then saw this new abomination. Where to start... well for one thing, I don't remember anything about our protagonist using the time machine to get his girl back. In my mind's eye he was a very English, respectable, professorial type of scientist, a true geek who didn't have time for distractions like romance. He simply made a discovery and then explored it, with no other motive.Then when we get into the future, the Eloi were not nearly the passive bimbos that Wells portrayed. It was hard to believe that these typical humans, with their typical strength of will and sense of community, could naively accept the fact that their family members were disappearing. Nor in Wells' story were they capable of building basket-houses hanging on cliffs; they only subsisted, playing like children, eating the food and wearing the clothes that the Morlocks provided, and sleeping together at night in ancient structures left behind by their technologically advanced ancestors, always in large groups because they felt safer that way. Wells didn't need some exotic form of telepathy to cause them to be so enslaved; rather, evolution had done it. The Eloi were like sheep, and the Morlocks were their shepherds. It had become their genetic predisposition. Wells' future was meant to be a believable one in which current trends continue, and society gets split into two classes - the consumers (technophobes, average Joes) and the producers (who aquire power by their superior abilities).At least the Morlocks looked like really different creatures rather than mere humans-with-bad-makeup, as they did in the first movie.The rest is all fabrication with most of the original story thrown out the window; and not even as good as typical Hollywood fabrication, at that. It's just plain crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why oh why did they bother with this remake?It adds a moronic subplot about the death of a girlfriend (apparently just to explain why the time traveller invented his machine) then makes complete nonsense of Well's social commentary by making the Eloi into sympathetic characters and adding some sort of "uber-morlock" to explain their inability to resist the ravages of the Morlocks.Watch the 1960 version if you want an amusing and lighthearted film. Better still read the book (and the excellent sequel "the Time Ships" by Steven Baxter).I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this - I saw it on an plane so I couldn't even do anything else useful, except sleep.Sleep would have been better, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there anything worse than a bad science fiction film? Like Pitch Black, another perplexing commercial hit, this deserves to be remembered with all the scorn and vitriol otherwise lavished on Waterworld, The Postman and Battlefield Earth. I only wish I'd said it first, but it's true this sucks 31 flavours of something very bad. The writing is poor, the acting - ahem - uneven, and the incidental science is laughable.In the past, it seems, the Americans were either Australians speaking stage-school European English (Guy Pearce) or English speaking Hollywood American (Mark Addy, reprising his abysmal yankee-doo-doo accent from the Chris Rock Heaven Can Wait remake).In the future, apparently, everyone will be Oirish, buff and beautiful, and a tasteful and non-threatening light level of "colour". The bad people, obviously, will be very English and very, very white. Was some bizarre shamrock radiation released from the exploded moon, or was Guy Pearce's descent into lilt in the final reel just a subtle nod to show how self-conscious and embarassed he really was?Guy Pearce heroically casts realistic psychology aside as his neurotic genius character sinks into a 4-year depression when his girlfriend is shot, and creates a time machine. So much for crayoning on the mattress wallpaper of his new bedroom and lots of new white-coated friends. A plot twist shoots him into the far future, where within only 2 days he realises the true secret of happiness is a warm, black teenage R'n'B singer. A brief side-step to the year 2030 shows how frighteningly close we are to developing artificially intelligent holograms so self-aware they can patronise mere ignorant humans. And in a mere 30 years teachers will apparently threaten their museum school-trip charges that they should keep up or she'll "resequence their DNA". This is one of two references which suggest that the nearest this story ever approached real science fiction, let alone real science, is catching occasional episodes of Star Trek the Next Generation.I feel obliged to point out that H.G. Wells's Eloi are pale, effete and unsympathetic. The Morlocks are supposed to be an ironic observation of the underclass, brutish and ignorant but ultimately ascendant over their surface-dwelling former masters. Ironically enough, here the only half-decent and memorable performance is Jeremy Irons as the "uber-Morlock", who asks the petulant time traveller "Who are you to argue with 800,000 years of evolution?".If you didn't think this was an insult to your intelligence, you've probably already pre-ordered Attack of the Clones on DVD. Never mind, 30 years from now the moon will sort us all out anyway. See you in the caves! Yum!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, minor flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached this film with trepidation, mainly because the George Pal version of the classic H. G. Wells story was so good. I needn't have worried. This version of `The Time machine' is really very good, although with some minor flaws.If the most interesting parts of a remake of a classic film were the changes that have been made to the story, I would say that all of the changes in this film were for the better. The old cliché of a scientist dedicated to knowledge and discovery had been done to death and wisely they gave this scientist a personal reason to build a time machine. His grief at his inability to change the past, and the time paradoxes inherent in within this, were well displayed. Similarly, the events that destroyed the earth prior to the final 800,000 years journey were changed from the normal global human war, another cliché, to a more realistic man made ecological disaster.Good points. I liked the idea of the synthetic librarian. I had never seen Orlando Jones in any film that I had liked before, but he fitted perfectly into this film. I liked the jokes. Did anybody else spot the quick L. A. Confidential reference? And Andrew Lloyd Webber ? don't even think about it.The Morlocks were genuinely frightening. Was this really only a (UK) PG certificate, letting young children see it without any adult supervision? Certainly the hunting scenes in the forest were better than the similar scenes in Tim Burton's `Planet Of The Apes' and much more exciting.There was another good performance from Guy Pearce, showing previously unseen action man tendencies. And he was more of a Victorian scientist than Rod Taylor ever was. I'm not sure if Samantha Mumba can act, but she did not jar and was not out of place. Flaws. Not enough Jeremy Irons, but everyone has said that. It was probably too slow for the multiplex crowd, and too short as well. I would like to have seen more stops on the way into the future, but these are minor gripes. Very good. Yes, very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, someone told me this was based on HG Wells Time Machine but they must have been confused because this was a hokey, bland piece of crap. The only decent moments were Jeremy Irons and some of the stuff with the library computer. The unnecessary insertion of the dead girlfriend completely altered the main character and his motivation. The move from London to New York was also completely unnecessary especially since most of the actors weren't even American to start off with. The Eloi were basically normal human beings and those were some remarkably well preserved stone inscriptions, very lame way to explain why he could communicate with the Eloi. Boring, lame and pedestrian. Do not go and see this movie, read the book instead... and the sequel which is very good. Steven Spielberg must be stopped before he can do anymore harm, thank God he didn't get hold of Harry Potter! (not that CC did a particularly great job, but that's for another review)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless and silly remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's count how faithful this remake was to the book. They both had time machines. They both had Morlocks. And . . . well, that's about it. All right, you don't have to make a movie match its source material exactly (but why make people think it does, other than false advertising?). However, if you're going to change things, you should at least try to improve matters.The movie fails. The story is one cliche after another, played as though the writers had never read anything about time travel (it's clear the writers never read Wells -- it's a joke that he's credited). It plods along, the 90 minutes seeming like several weeks. And it's filled with howlers. 800,000 years and people still speak in contemporary English? Because they read it from the ruins of old buildings (and happened to understand a vocabulary of words that would never be on the buildings in the first place)? Why not just call Mara "Tiffany" and make it more ridiculous?As for the end, it's impossible to figure out exactly what happened, or why it occurred. What ended up killing the Morlocks? Why? A good writer would have established that this would work ("Don't touch that! It will blow us to atoms!"). I guess they thought the flashy effects would be enough to fool the audience.Speaking of effects, why are the time travel effects so wimpy? I could understand the reluctance of of matching the effects of the 1960 movie, but they don't even try. We see very little to indicate the passage of time, just a generic blue-white glow.The story builds no suspense. The time paradox idea is handled terribly: why exactly does the girlfriend have to die a second time? How did his going back in time cause it? If he tried again, why wouldn't that work? The Morlock attack is purely by-the-numbers, as is Jeremy Irons' performance as the head Morlock.What a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But sadly it seems the majority of people don't anymore! Judging from some of the comments here, that's what I can tell. Most people like to dissect EVERY detail of the movie and make sure everything fits. There's no such things as suspension of disbelief. They want a movie to make sense in every way, EVEN when it's dealing with a largely fanciful idea like The Time Machine! come on people, it's not real! I enjoyed the romantic and touching side of the story, where this scientist tried to reverse what happened to his fiancee and I understood why some scenes were obviously cut out because of the reason he invented the Time machine. That error in the film making aside, I realize that when dealing with such a fanciful subject and the cynical audiences of today any moviemaker might get into trouble if they don't watch every little detail. I forgive the film maker because the movie's so GORGEOUS to look at and the action sequences are very exciting. This is pure sci fi fun to me, a sci fi lover. The score is magnificent and the cinematography is awesome! I enjoyed Guy Pearce's intense portrayal of the lovelorn Alex Hartdegan searching for the answer to his plaintive "what if?". All in all it lived up to my expectations and was time well spent. I imagine when the deleted scenes are added in the dvd we'll get a more rounded version of the story in the meantime I just enjoyed the movie for what it was!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>being a big fan of sci-fi and action movies, I had a reasonably good time at this new TIME MACHINE film. The special effects are really awe-inspiring and Guy Pearce was fine in his role. I also liked the fact that it didn't run on too long. 90 minutes of escapism is just what I needed, and it's what I got from this movie. The movie isn't always completely coherent, in fact there are some logical errors (just read any review by a critic), but don't take it too seriously and you'll have a decent time with it. It's certainly a lot more fun that TOMB RAIDER or some of the recent Hollywood blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What of Waste of "Time"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine, although packed with pretty good special effects and the momentary high-paced action scene, leaves little for the intellectual movie goer. Eventually, somewhere in the first twenty minutes of the film (try not to doze off or you'll miss it), the main goal of our lead character evolves. The main character's "Quest," is a seemingly interesting plot but the screenplay writers seem to drop the creative ball after the idea was born missing several opportunities to "thicken" that plot and develop it into a movie. There were also far too many times when you were wondering "How did I get here?" in the movie and "why is this character significant?" But possibly, the most frequent question I heard asked in the theater was "How do I get my money back?"This is one of those movies where it appears that the CGI budget ate all of the resources of the film and caused the producers to end the film abruptly. If I were you, I'd wait for this movie to come out on cable.</fullReview>

Although certain parts of the movie I really questioned and wondered why the protagonist did the things he did, it all made sense in time. Any movie that can make you want to yell at the lead character and really him or her to do things differently is good. That sort of interaction is what the movies are about.

		<shortDescription>Too short, yet visually stunning...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole concept of time traveling has always fascinated me. Since I many years ago sat the amazing film trilogy "Back to the future", I've been eager to see any film that has anything to do with this theme.On to the film... I saw the film 3 hours ago, so still fresh in memory! The first I want to say is that it is visually stunning! Apart from Fellowship of the Rings, I have never seen such amazing animation. The scenes, in which we see the travels through time, are so beautiful that you just have to give a lot of credits to the animators. Brilliant work.Now, the story about the distracted professor who wants to go back into time to prevent his loved one from dying, is fine and well done by H.G. Wells. Also the part about evolution is nice, and the little trick concerning how we human beings are destroying the world is also fine.As for the roles, gorgeous Samantha Mumba has her debut in this film. Except for her being a definite attraction and a pop singer here in Europe, she also displays a fine talent for acting - me and my friend enjoyed her acting - Samantha may you get many acting jobs in the future!Jeremy Irons as the over-morlok is also fine. It is a brief, restrained role, but well played - as always when Jeremy Irons acts, it is brilliant.Finally, Guy Pearce as the "nutty professor" Alexander, who after the death of his loved one devotes his life into inventing a time machine, is well done.What I liked very much in this film, is the morloks and the speculations of evolution. These superhuman beings, who are superior to man in all ways, are really fantastic done. Too bad they are not more seen so much in the film as one could hope, but the fighting scene with Alexander and a morlok is funny and adds a bit action to the film.The film is too short. Jeremy Irons' scene where he and Alexander are having a dreary conversation, could have been a bit longer and perhaps a little bit more interesting, as well as the film could have been extended at least a half an hour.Go see it, if nothing else, then to see sexy Samantha Mumba!

Wells was a very smart writer, with sometimes scary visions of what the future could hold in store for humankind - why ignore all this?Back in the 1960's they had less technology to produce special effects, so they USED THEIR BRAINS, and they had read Wells' book, and apparently understood the message. So in spite of their primitive special effects the film is still great to watch today.Whereas this tasteless, dumb 2002 version will probably be forgotten by next year - good riddance.Antoine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There now: That wasn't so good, was it?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a fan of H. G. Wells' original novella -- or of the 1960 George Pal film -- this is yet another dismal proof of Hollywood's positive genius for sucking every last bit of life and meaning from a classic. Though it repeatedly references the Pal film, in every way this movie fails even to live up to the standard of mediocrity set by that first cinematic attempt. George Pal at least demonstrated some respect for the original material, while Simon "Great-Grandson of H.G." Wells apparently couldn't have cared less. First there's the addition of a subplot involving the Time Traveller's murdered fiancé: (Spoiler alert) When he completes his time machine and goes back to the past to save her, he succeeds in preventing her death at the hands of a mugger, but then she gets killed by a runaway car, proving of course that "It's not nice to fool with the space-time continuum". Grief-stricken, he resolves to travel into the future and find someone who can tell him how to unravel this paradox. (I guess simple curiosity is no longer sufficient motive for a Time Traveller, when you've gutted your story and padding is desperately needed.)The movie then lifts a page from George Pal's film by having humanity almost destroy itself in the near future. In Pal's version it was by nuclear war; here it's a disastrous attempt at excavating luxury colonies on the Moon with thermonuclear devices. The concept is the same, just much, much stupider.When our hero finally arrives in A.D. 800,000+ the movie becomes an exercise in purest gawdawfulness. Wells' story handed filmmakers some of the most haunting images in all of science fiction literature, and this outfit turns one of them into laughable giant Tim-Burtonesque steel cat skulls, then trashes just about everything else. I suppose it was also inevitable that we'd get the chatty holograph played by Orlando Jones, though for whatever it's worth his is undoubtedly the best performance, notwithstanding Jeremy Irons' cameo.For me to describe everything that's so wrongheaded about what this film does with Wells' distant future of the Eloi and Morlocks would take far too long, but here's a couple of quick examples: "Suspension of disbelief" doesn't even begin to describe what you need to swallow the notion that -- nearly a million years in the future -- some of the Eloi learn to speak flawless English from a few surviving street signs and public inscriptions. Then there's Irons' campy, glossy-black-leather Head Morlock costume and albino makeup, which make him look as if he's decided to explore an alternate career path as an Edgar Winter imitator, or lead singer in the Whitesnake "Experience" (not the real Whitesnake, but an incredible simulation).In addition to his shameless exploitation of his relation to Wells to promote this blandly inept butchery of a classic story, the director also deserves extra smacks upside the head with the 2 X 4 of Justice for blatantly ripping off the famous hunt scene in the original "Planet of the Apes". And doing a spectacularly lousy job of it. (Spoiler alert -- though frankly, I don't see how this could be considered a spoiler when the climactic blowing up of the bad guys' stronghold is as essential to hack sf-action-film-making as stink to a skunk, but consider yourself alerted.) After going mano a mano with the Uber-Morlock and rescuing his Eloi chick, the Time Traveller jams the gears of his time machine, conveniently converting it into a Morlock-dissolving mini-nuke, while leaving just enough time for the hero and heroine to escape. Yay! This is the sort of high-Dumbth cinematic sludge that makes you want to lobby for an international tribunal to prosecute crimes against source material, aggravated by contempt for the audience. While I am no advocate for slavish adherence to the original story, if a film is going to use the title of a classic it should at least leave its sense and spirit mostly intact. "The Time Machine" may be the most moving, evocative and finely crafted piece that H. G. Wells ever wrote. It deserves far better treatment than this slick but turgid stew of clichés.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the morlocks could run at sixty bijillion miles per second, why did the stumbling Pearce and Mumba manage to outrun them without much of a head start? That really bothers me.Don't get me wrong. The Time Machine had good special effects but the novel (which I read a long time ago) had depth, dammit. DEPTH.I read an interview with Simon Wells a while ago about the making of the film and he said that he needed to bring the story to a modern audience, or words to that effect. I didn't think he meant that he was going to dumb it down so spectacularly. It also seemed to me that he thought the book was flawed somehow and so needed jazzing up. The Time Machine is a classic, Simon. Leave it alone.Having said that though, the thing I did like that wasn't in the book was the 'why can't I change the past?' question which made him travel to the future. As I said, not in the book- but would have made an interesting story had it been followed through. Instead, it loses focus when the morlocks appear. Its almost as though Simon Wells didn't have the conviction to carry on and instead decided he needed to stick more closely(ish) to the novel. As a result, the whole movie seems very disjointed. Especially when Jeremy Irons appears as the bad guy and then gets disposed of in practically the same scene.I also wanted to see an ending other than 'And everything gets blown up'. I was really hoping that Pearce was going to do something really clever with the time machine to save the day. But no. The film makers needed an explosion to end on.There really are so so many faults and plot holes which Simon Wells and his gang MUST have noticed. They are way too obvious to ignore. They jump at you, wearing bright pink bowler hats and scream, 'Hey, look at us! We are the movie gremlins! We will spoil your film!'. But no one seemed to notice them when making the movie and now we have another disappointing film to review. Ah well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather bland attempt at a special effects movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years back, Dreamworks announced that HG Well's classictime travel story, The Time Machine, would be brought to the bigscreen for the first time in almost forty years. In the long-awaited adaptation directed by Simon Wells, thegrandson of the writer, Guy Pearce plays Alexander Hartdegen, aprofessor at Columbia University, who decides to build a timemachine after his fiancée, Emma, is killed in a robbery. After hisplans to return to the past to save her life fails, the Time Travelerfinds himself racing farther and farther forward in time until hearrives 800,000 years into the future. By that time, the human racehas evolved into two distinct species: the kind-natured andinnocent Eloi, and the brutal, subterranean Morlocks that kill andfeast on them. Having nothing better to do, Alex decides to take itupon itself to right the wrongs of this inhumane future.The Time Machine clearly falls into the genre of science-fictioneffects movies, a genre that has been fairly prominent in the lastyear with The Mummy Returns and Planet of the Apes lastsummer and the more recent The Lord of the Rings. In principle, aproper sci-fi effects movie is one where the visual effects takeprecedence over the story and acting. Surprisingly, this movie hascool visual effects and a decent story, yet it still manages to falter.The movie sticks fairly close to the original story, while payingtribute to the 1960 movie by George Pal and taking artistic licensewith the reasons for the time machine being built. It quickly cuts tothe chase with Alex taking his first jaunt in the Time Machine onlyfifteen minutes into the movie, sparing the viewer of a long set-up. There is an innocence to the first half of the movie, as Alexexperiments with time travel that harks back to the simplicity of theera in which the story was written. The second half, where Alexlearns the harsh realities of the future and tries to protect the Eloifrom the Morlocks, is more like your typical modern-day sci-fimovie. While The Time Machine could not exactly be considered boring,it's also not particularly entertaining. It keeps you interestedenough to see what happens next, but there are no laughs andnone of the emotion necessary to help the audience connect withany of the characters. The CGI itself is quite good, especially inshowing the passage of time, but it also seems detached from thenon-CGI. The time-travelling effects are the obvious draw, as is theimpressive attention to detail while recreating various eras. It wasfascinating to see a 19th Century New York with the streets filledwith horse-and-carriages, and the near future of 2030 showed abit of creativity. The most beautiful scenery is in the future world ofthe Eloi, where the world looks like something out of Riven (Iprobably could have done without the Survivor theme music,though.) It would have been nice if Alex had spent a bit more timein each era, as the two eras he visits before arriving in the farfuture are barely touched upon.The Morlocks themselves look awful. The CGI versions of thecreature look cool enough--a bit like the pygmies from The MummyReturns?but the rest of them look like men in bad costumes andHalloween masks. They are not even remotely frightening and arealmost laughably bad. It's hard to believe that the legendary StanWinston is responsible for this B-movie moment in what wouldhave been an otherwise impressive movie visually.In general, the script and dialogue are okay, though there are a fewweaker moments between Alex and his confidante, Dr. Philby(played by Mark Addy). Of course, the Eloi have their ownnonsense language to make sure the viewer has no idea how badthe dialogue would have been if their scenes were left in English.Their silliness is almost as annoying as the Gungan-talk in StarWars Episode 1. The talented Guy Pearce is one of the few saving graces thatkeeps this movie from being painfully unwatchable at times. Atfirst, he comes across as a 21st Century Jimmy Stewart, hammingit up as the hapless and bumbling professor, but over the courseof the movie, he gains his confidence and his footing in time travel.Either way, he's much better as a leading man in a genre wherethe effects take top billing, than Brendan Fraser or Mark Wahlberg. Another standout performance is Jeremy Irons as the creepyUber-Morlock, looking very much like an albino Marilyn Manson.Although his time on screen is minimal, he makes the perfectlyevil nemesis for Pearce. On the other hand, former 7-upspokesman, Orlando Jones, plays Vox, a compendium of humanknowledge, and one of the most annoying synthetic beings sinceJude Law in AI. His character seems unnecessary to the story, andhe fails to add the humorous factor that seemed to be theintention. Technically, this isn't a bad movie and it keeps the viewerentertained, but there's so much potential, and the movie fails tomeet up to expectations. In an attempt to keep the film down to the90 minute mark, Wells has left out the sort of characterdevelopment that would help the audience relate to the characters,and he fails to take advantage of the possibilities of time travel.While the movie tries to express a message, it's never very clearwhat it is--don't try to change the past? Evolution is bad? TheMorlocks are just stunt men in ugly costumes? And the ending thattries to wrap things up in a neat little package was justaggravating.Clearly, Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings has raised the baron what constitutes a great effects epic, and The Time Machinefalls well below the bar. While the visual effects are decent, as isGuy Pearce's performance, the movie fails to deliver on what HGWells set-up as an excellent premise. Rating: 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an insult to H. G. Wells and what a shallow and boring movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an insult to H.G. Wells. He would be shaking in his tomb if he ever saw this stupid movie.It totally destroyed my imagination on what the Morlocks looked like, and if I may say so, this movie has the worst character/monster design I have ever seen. The Morlocks have less articulation on their faces than the characters in the Jim Henson Movie "Laberinth". It"s pathetic. My question is, where the hell did all the money go to when doing this film. Two big studios behind it and the special effects shots are awfull. You can tell when it's a CG shot or a matte Painting. The adaptation to the screen is awfull, and it makes the movie shallow when that's the opposite of what Wells tried to convey in his novel. The soudtrack is terrible and it doesn't go with the story. It sounded more like if I was seeing The Lion King because of the happy music. The only reason I'm giving it a second star is because the effects used to show the passing of time was pretty good. But the rest sucked. Especially Jeremy Irons' acting. What a Flopp. Please, Don't go to see this movie. You'll waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited about this remake, because I loved the 60's version. That is why I was so let down by this new version. It disappoints on many levels. Firstly, because the end result is far less than the some of its parts. It has a great potential story, first class actors, and special effects. Unfortunately, Wells combines these into a rather muddled maudlin second rate movie. Secondly, Simon Wells managed to distill out the essence of the story, which is really about class struggle.See it if you have bored 10 year old children to entertain. Otherwise do your self a favor and re-read the original book, which should take all of an afternoon. In fact read the book to your 10 year old kids, they'll get a lot more out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the original 1960 movie and have read the 1895 novel all movie versions are based on. In my opinion the 1960 movie version is much more faithful to the novel, but the 2002 version does have infinitely better special effects. But special effects do not make a movie. The acting in the 2002 version is good, but Rod Taylor's unforgettable performance in the 1960 is better. And just to set the record straight, I've noticed that some people didn't like this movie because the Morlocks could talk and they felt this wasn't faithful to the 1960 movie version where they could not talk, well in the novel, they can speak, but they speak a different language than the Eloi. I give this movie a 6. It's entertaining and worth the effort to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised with this movie. The critics, in general, did not seem to favor this movie. So I was not expecting too much when I went to see it. Sure, pieces of it were a bit predictable. Sometimes the dialogue was a little corny, and they took major poetic license with the book. But the movie was exciting as all get-out. You sympathize with the main character. The movie sticks to its themes and doesn't ramble or wander. It's lovely to watch--the photography and directing are wonderful. But the thing I like most of all is that this movie kept the tradition of its book in making you think. It's a big story of what-if on the inside. It's absolutely fascinating! The end is satisfying as well. Overall, a very entertaining, enjoyable watch...I wouldn't mind seeing it again.</fullReview>

This new version of The Time Machine does not really follow the book all that well, however, it keeps some of the important details straight. Guy Pearce does a great job portraying the time traveller, and although there is no Uber-Morlock in the book or the 1960 movie, it adds some life to this already action-packed film. Special effects are Oscar-winning caliber and music just adds to the excellency of the movie."Two thumbs up!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pay attention to what this movie says!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After this film's end credits started rolling, someone in the theater audience said, "the original movie was so much better!" I beg to differ. This remake is infinitely superior: Pay attention to what it is saying. It is so easy to debunk a remake. Yes, the villains are lame, and way too CGI, but the first third of the film makes up for this. It tells us that, even though we can invent a device to transport us to the past, we cannot change what is destined for us... we can only change our present, and therefore fulfill our future destiny, which is what the main character does here. You don't find this narrative thread in the 1960 film, and although Jeremy Irons (he plays the villain) only appears in the 2002 version for only a short scene, he tells us pretty much the same thing, albeit crudely, and in his character's merciless way. See this film with someone you hold dear to your heart, and for God's sake pay attention to the dialogue and what the filmmakers of this one are trying to tell you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent telling of classic early sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is truly spectacular. Everything is so amazing, from visuals to situations. I feel that half an hour or so was cut from this film, it does seem lie the conclusion is too abrupt, but it's so completely different from anything you get now adays. It's the best thing I've seen on screen in a long time. I see 6.0 represents the mass market. If you appreciate first generation sci-fi, this is far more innovative than anything you'll see from the genre. Like 13th floor, which also didn't get a decent Imdb rating, and serial experiments Lain, this film is diferrent. So many movies are the same story retold. People will look at this and see too much of the planet of the apes, and some other films, but remember this story is from 1898 or some such time. As different from the norm as existenz and as visually impressive as apes or spirits within, for any fan of real sci-fi, this is a must see. If your idea of sci-fi is star wars, star trek or even matrix, you're probably more likely to have rated LOTR as the #1 film, and this will entertain you, but if you own your own copy of metropolis, thought the original apes was better, (those the first half of Burton's was very impressive) and prefer blade runner without the narration see this film. If The quiet earth is on your top films list, see this. It's a different kind of sci fi. It's what AI could have been, if it weren't so ^$%(% Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course critics and die hard fans of the 1960 version were willing to forgive the 1960 version for it's flaws but they will never extend the same courtesy to Simon Wells and his updating of the time travel novel. But I will because I recognize that Simon wells, being a first time live action director didn't have access to resources that might have made the few problems in the film less noticeable. Just as George Pal didn't have the technology to create the spectacular effects and time lapse photography that made some scenes in this movie so memorable, perhaps Simon Wells was limited as well. We don't know all the ins and outs of the film making business but I am impressed that he did so well with what he had to work with. Some may then retaliate by saying he shouldn't have made it at all but I say the love and pride for his great grandfather's novel is very evident in this film. The updating of the novel to include a romantic reason for the time traveler to go into the future was believable. Guy Pearce was effective as Alexander Hartdegan and was able to pull off the nerdy professor to action hero very creditably. Many find it hard to credit his transformation to a courageous defender of his new found love and her brother and the Eloi in 802,701 but remember folks, four long years passed between the tragedy and his machine working a long time in which anger, self recrimination, and grief helped to make him a more focused and determined man. Guy Pearce brought this desperation to the screen very well, in the scene where he first visits 2030 he barely takes time to see wonders around him, so intent is he on finding the answer to his "what if??" For the fast pacing in the film I thought most of the actors did a fine job. Nice graphics and a very real look to the Morlocks give a more tense and scary feel to the final showdown between the Eloi/Morlock groups. I agree sometimes you felt rushed and there wasn't time to develop characterizations and relationships but there you have it. "The Time machine" worked for me. I'd go back to time to see it again!</fullReview>

Also his not having to return to his present--because changes in the original storyline eliminated his reasons--didn't sit well with me. If one ignores George Pal's classic cinematic telling of this tale, this movie seems like a decent enough adventure flick, with mostly adequate (some actually more than adequate) acting, and very nice special effects.

This movie is simply a fun thrill ride of special effects and a touching love story that has a happy ending added in. That makes for a good time right there but because it's based on the wonderful book "The Time Machine" there's more opportunity for wonder and fantasy and Simon Wells used his vivid imagination to the full to give the audience that. This story has romance, intrigue, action, suspense and edge of your seat twist and turns as we see Alexander the absent minded time traveler on a quest to rescue his beloved fiance. His invention, the Time Machine, manages to inadvertently end up in 802,701 where man has divided into two races, Eloi/Morlock. Morlocks use the Eloi for a horrible purpose and the peaceful Eloi seemed locked in this existence for all time. But once Alexander comes along and starts asking questions as any inquisitive scientist will certainly do, things heat up and the final result of the confrontation of the two races is quite impressive. Guy Pearce is as always good. Samantha Mumba was adequate, she's very good eye candy (as is Guy ). The rest of the cast do well but I must single out Orlando Jones' character as worthy of special note. Some of the scenes involving him were very funny and really provided comic relief this pretty serious movie needed. And we can't expect a geeky absent minded professor driven by a desperate need to save his fiance from death to be amusing a la Brendan Fraser in "the Mummy" I'm so glad Simon Wells realized this and didn't go there. That was a relief.So I'm pretty happy with the result. But see it for yourself. That's all you can do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the advertising for this film there really wasn't a LOT of people in the theatre tonight when I finally got to see the new film version of H.G. Wells 'The Time Machine' (we saw the actual time machine prop and many design and behind the scenes pics last AUGUST of 2001 at the San Diego ComiCon), and anyone who ignored those ads missed out; this movie was a lot of fun and had some very engaging themes and ideas to boot. While it may fall short a tad on some levels it still had some great sci fi ideals seasoned in here and there, and the themes running through it were strong. It is typical of modern blockbusters in its adventure, but then it also has touching moments of reflection (Alexandre, the time traveler's, "what if" moment where he 'puts aside' designs for the Time Machine to be with a family) or startling imagery that is either beautiful (the Eloi homes) or disturbing (the cracked moon). And it all begins with some gorgeous and insightful victoriana. The morlocks, which looked all-too CGI in the trailers were instead mostly quite creepy Stan Winston animatronics, and Jeremy Irons as the ubermorlock was cold and freaky. The themes that carry along in the film are pushed home by a wonderful score, Guy Pearce is cool as always, Samantha Mumba is hot, and Simon Wells (H.G.'s great grandson) direction is visually driven by the design and effects work. There are some cool George Pal (Original TM film version director, as well as War or The Worlds) nods, and some interesting ideas and characters, notably the Computer Librarian Hologram, as played by Orlando Jones, who reflects on 800,000 years of solitude to a man who simply zipped right through it in his machine. You almost wish you could have seen more of the machine, or the travels, or the characters here and there, but for what this version is trying to be, I think it works throughout, and that H.G. would be proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imaginative rendering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning! May contain spoilers!My wife and I found this version of The Time Machine to be entertaining, imaginative, and thought provoking. If I had only one criticism, it would be that the film felt as if it's makers were trying to fit too much into too little time (no pun intended). Each major plot twist or "future" was only flirted with and not expanded upon as I had hoped for or expected. This is not to mention the fact that nothing was explored in the 20th century as in the '60's film. Our time traveler made not a pit stop in even our own time, let alone other key periods prior to 2040, and that one barely elicited a blink in the scheme of things. His extended stop in the distant future could also have been explored with more detail, if only to allow for some additional character development.In spite of all this, I found the film engrossing enough to keep my attention and interest for it's entire duration, if only leaving me wanting more. Unlike other users I've read, I was very impressed with the special effects and felt them to be done in a way to enhance an imaginative story line rather than being over done as a means to make up for a flimsy script or plot as in so many other movies made these days. I was also very impressed (as was my wife) with the sets and artwork; the 19th century scenes felt like something out of a Currier and Ives painting, and the time machine and scenes surrounding it during it's travels were just short of astounding.As for the Elois, I was struck by the simple, yet seemingly spiritual and passive culture represented in the film. (Loved the festive music added as a ambiance to create the mood and setting.) And the Morlocks were truly ominous and scary enough to get some cardio-vascular response. It is a shame more was not done with the Jeremy Irons character, although in this case I suppose less is more and was certainly a major highlight in the film.Not only have I seen the original Time Machine, but own it on VHS, as it warrants repeated viewing time and again. But I would not make the mistake of comparing this entry with the original....more like apples and oranges. That being said, I must say that overall I am partial to the 60's version if only by virtue of it's comprehensiveness and focus. It has a better "flow" to it not to mention the fact that Rod Taylor was (in my opinion) in another league as an actor compared with Guy Pearce. And where the original may fall short a tad on special effects by comparison, it certainly makes up for that shortcoming with a killer script and impeccable direction. (I saw the original in the theater as a child when it came out but have yet to read H.G.Wells' book.)I definitely recommend this film and would rate it slightly higher than a 7. Sci-fi/fantasy fans should enjoy it especially. And I commend the producers and director for avoiding the commercial pitfalls plagued by most movies these days. This Time Machine felt like more of a creative effort and less "Hollywood" and "hi-tech". It does take you in, and leaves you with the viewpoint that although we cannot change the past, we can definately make a difference in the creation of a better future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm just going to list the very good things about this movie because it seems that the people who are determined to turn everybody against it are working overtime at making sure you hear about the slightest shortcoming in the film and blow it totally out of proportion. Short synopsis first: Warning-SOME SPOILERS HEREThis is the story of a man living in New York Victorian times who is an absent minded professor in love with a woman and finally gets up the nerve to propose to her. Then he suffers a terrible tragedy and tries to undo what happened by inventing a time machine to bring his love back to life. Doesn't work, so he travels to future for answers but due to an accident the machine takes him to 802,701 where he meets a beautiful Eloi girl and her brother who take care of him and nurse him to health. They're part of the Eloi tribe who live above ground and are menaced by the terrible Morlocks, who live underground. Alexander finds the answer to his poignant "What if?" in the person of the Uber Morlock-the Morlock leader and also saves Mara and her brother along the way and discovers that he has found something more promising in the future than in the past. He falls in love with Mara and she falls in love with him. Now they have to destroy the threat of the Morlocks to their happiness.. Guy Pearce did a very credible job as the time traveler. He had some very memorable emotional moments that showcased his fine acting skills. I hope he gets his due one day from his peers for being such a fine actor and committing himself so devotedly to his roles no matter what they are. Awesome effects made for some fine visual entertainment. Check out the beautiful New York scenes. There's a outstanding scene of the terrible effects of man messing with the moon. You will gasp at the beauty and terror of it, believe me. Good job here. Give an award to the person who created the Victorian era scenes and the Eloi dwellings. Gorgeous. Jeremy Irons-short time on screen but he was creepy and effective despite that with the role he was given. The Morlocks frightened me-they were horrible. Tell the kids before you take them to prepare them for some edge of your seat jarring scenes here. The ending scene where they blend two dimensions of time in one shot and you see a scene from the past and from the 802,701 time consecutively. That was very well done! All of these outstanding things and others pretty much enabled me to enjoy this movie immensely. I realize critics don't like remakes and slam all of them but this one is one for our time. A keeper and time well spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not mad at Simon Wells. He did a good job with the material he had to work with. Some effects were quite awesome and well done. The New York scenes in the Victorian times have been mentioned quite often and I think they merit extraordinary praise. I'm not a fan of the original so I'm not going to tear it apart, just say for what the flick tried to do, which is entertain an audience that's family minded it did a pretty good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's all I ask in a movie like this and The Time Machine delivered on many counts. Suspension of belief helps. After all we ARE talking about a man traveling through time. If you go to a movie with that theme obviously you're willing to except what's presented as fantasy. A well made science fiction effects extravaganza. Critics don't have a clue. One great thing about this movie was how it didn't try to talk down to the audience. It accepted that everybody understood what they were showing and built it into a very visually moving movie. Some of the scenes were totally shocking and moving. Pay attention to the moon scene. Kind of short in some places like scenes had been cut but the overall effect made it worthwhile-it was simply stunning! Guy Pearce is becoming an actor known for carrying movies now so look out. Never underestimate the power of a handsome Guy! (even though they tried to cover it up in the movie)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun and thought provoking movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie. Okay, it was far from Oscar caliber, but after reading a few critiques and watching the movie, I wondered whether the critics had some personal agenda beyond merely rating this film. It's a fun, popcorn movie that has some cool special effects. Simon Wells did an excellent job in his first foray into live action. The action scenes hint at his potential at becoming an action/adventure heavyweight contender. The characters definitely could be fleshed out more, though. The story covers things so fast that at times I felt I was in the Time Machine watching the movie go by in a blink of an eye. The acting was a bit flat in the beginning, but Orlando Jones' character is a worthwhile treat, as is Jeremy Irons'. John Logan's writing style is the same as in Gladiator--beautifully epic but emotionally cold. The end was poetic and the overall theme was thought provoking. Too bad they didn't wait to release this in the summer--it could have made more money. If you like Stargate, you'll like Time Machine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good adaptation, good special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the 1960 version on television when I was about five years old. And that one scared the crap outa me. Gave me nightmares. So, in an odd way, I was kinda looking forward to this one.I thought it was a good adaptation of (a) H.G.Wells story and (b) the 1960 script. Updated effects, more on character. The stuff they did to show the passage of time was very impressive.As for the acting.... Well, I liked everyone except for the star, Guy Pearce. Didn't buy him for an instant. Seemed a bit too wishy washy and awestruck to be believable as a scientist. The paradox he's out to find an answer to has been answered so many times by people who couldn't build a toaster, much less a time machine.Everyone else was great. Irons, Jones, the Mumbas. Fabulous. But they should've gone with someone else as the lead.Still, enjoyable. Scary at points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful adaptation of H.G. Wells' story in the context of a century later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although some might disagree, I think some things had to be changed to make the story fit the modern age, and I think this movie did so nicely. If you watch the original, it's obvious some of the culture biases that were prevalent at the time of its making. Weena, the leading-role eloi woman, was a blonde hair/blue eyes. I think it's great that they picked someone with darker skin for the leading eloi role, and Samantha Mumba did a fine job, without adding any pop-bias in it (which I was concerned about; I for one don't want pop culture to seep into our moviegoing experience, especially movies that I'm actually interested in seeing such as this one and the Matrix.) She's no Aliyah though, which is good, nor does she have the lack of acting ability of a Britney Spears. It's been predicted that at some point in the future, we may all have the same skin color of Vanessa Williams, so this is accurate. Also, this movie took time to explain why the Eloi spoke and understood English... something the older movie didn't. Comparing the two movies, you can also tell the effect that the feminism movement has had on our culture. In the original, Weena was a complete ditz, totally incompetent and incapable of making her own decisions. In this new one, Mumba's character is smart and competent. I also liked how they kept the relationship between Mumba's and Pierce's characters largely plutonic. Something else that's changed since 1960 is the end of the Cold War, so Wells' apocalyptic scenario didn't seem as likely. The moon destruction thing was a great change I thought, and looked awesome. In the 1960 version, the Morlocks would sound an alarm that used to be used during the war to get people to go to bomb shelters. The eloi would mindlessly march into the Morlocks' place. Again, since this seems less likely now, the Morlocks are changed into fierce hunters, the kind our protagonist can't single-handedly take on and destroy. And they they look awesome. The addition of the Uber-Morlock role fit well in my opinion, and I loved the fact that despite knowing the original story, I didn't know how it was going to end. The climax was very exciting, and the resolution was moving. Lastly, I was a bit apprehensive about the special effects, thinking they would overuse computer animation (which can look as fake as the special effects they used in the 1960s), but it turned out to be tastefully done. The time travel scenes looked amazing. Great job to everyone involved. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great March film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Time Machine" is one of the better 'after Holidays-before Summer blockbuster' films. It wouldn't survive in any other time-slot, but is great for March. Guy Pierce is exceptionally believable as an awed time-traveler, although the film doesn't draw the viewer in enough to allow deep feelings of sorrow for him. The Mumbas were great, even though they seemed more natural speaking English than they did their native tongue. And it is possible to practice a new language before filming to sound believable (check out Patricia Velasquez in "The Mummy Returns"). Orlando Jones was wonderful, and it would be very easy to sympathize with him above all others (you also feel the happiest for him in the end!). He also brought about the only humor seen in the entire movie. If apprehensive about spending your money to view "The Time Machine," at least consider the wonderful changes of scenery due to the 800,000 years of time passing. It is awesome to see what all scientists know happened in the past come to life before our very eyes-and in the future none-the-less. Great March film-seven and a half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time Machine == Good.I never read the book by HG Wells, yet I felt really good about some story elements in the film. Maybe I'll go read the book now. I never saw the 60's version so this won't be a comparison review.We're not talking Oscar quality here, unless for a technical catagory or perhaps for Samantha Mumba and Jeremy Irons (except his appearance was too brief).The movie felt like it was a touched by Mary Shelly's Frankenstein (the novel), with less emphasis on madness or morality, rather more about Possibility as an archetype. The main character did something that was impossible -- travel back and forth in time, and yet there is at no point in the film when someone goes... "Wow! A Time Traveller!". You'd think it a necessity in a time travel film, to have someone marvel over it! Yet every character just took for granted that there was a time traveller in their midst.I did enjoy the thought of going so far into the future. 800 000 years is far enough to give an idea of what happened to humanity. The Moon catastrophe was well played and brief (so it was not overdone... it was just right). I think the special effects were amazing. The models for the Morlocks were suspiciously close to a combination between a body builder (The Hulk) and an alien (not ET but Xfiles), which presented a mood unlike most sci fi baddies. I liked the bad guys. :)Irons restored himself (from AD&amp;D the mishap.. er movie). As Uber Morlock, he played an evolved predator with psionics. It was a cameo that was just right. Irons portrayed humanity at its finest, that human condition of self-denigration and deliberate hypocrisy. I thought Irons was monstrous without being a monster, although he looked the part. He was electric in the role.Guy Pearce played a perfect time traveller. He handled the whole experience as he should, except they did not show him letting go of his fiancé, which was required and missing. More motivation for his behaviour would have fit better.The best actor in the film was Samantha Mumba, in my humble opinion. She really played the role of Mara well and she manages to bridge the gap between the ancient society Alexander is from and the tribal cliff dwellers at present. If there is a reason for Alexander to remain in the future, it would be to get more of Samantha Mumba's fine drama and pleasant discourse.The photonic library character played by Orlando Jones was just cool. He played it well. They didn't mention too much about how a computer could stay running for 800 000 years, but maybe the OS was not made by Microsoft.Bottom line: see it.</fullReview>

Jeremy Irons was brilliant in his one scene, giving an elegantly vile performance as the Uber-Morlock. And Orlando Jones was hilarious, as always. Surprisingly, I felt more for his non-human character than I did for any of the others combined. Good special effects, but nothing really jaw-dropping. Still gave it a 7 because I did stay awake the whole time, even when Irons wasn't onscreen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the 1960 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen the 1960 version because I really liked this movie and had high hopes (originals are often better than remakes of course). However, I was disappointed with the original. This 2002 version obviously has better directing, surprisingly better acting, and (unsurprisingly) much better special effects - I reckon the special effects in this movie are good by 2000s standards, whereas surely the ones in the original would have been bad by 1960s standards.What struck me as most surprising though is that the 2002 version's story is much deeper - it deals with the subject of inevitability and explores whether the main character can change the past. In doing so, it gives the main character much more of a reason to go into the future than the original version did (which came across as a fun adventure, coming back just right for tea time).So, the main actors look better, so there's a romance - but hey, they had a pretty girl in the 1960 version, too, so don't diss it because of that. I have not read the book, so I don't know whether the brainy ruler of the morlock is in the book or not - it is never mentioned in the 1960s version, but here makes total sense and is a gaping plot hole in the 1960s version (how could the seemingly primitive morlocks build the machines by themselves?!). The movie has some very good ideas (whether original or from the book, but certainly not in the 1960 movie), like where the people live, the way they live, the changed language, the old library and remnants of the original language.In summary, this *is* an intelligent movie just like the 1960 version, but without some logical flaws. On top of that, it is enjoying to watch, well paced, looks nice and has good special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.G. Wells story of the time machine is familiar, and this version is not as good as others and maybe better than some. The 1960 version won an Oscar for special effects. The effects here were great also, especially the Morlocks.You have to remember the Morlocks and the Eloi, especially if you saw Gary Sinise in Ransom. he was obsessed with them.This version was directed by H.G. Wells' great grandson Simon, who also directed The Prince of Egypt and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, wrote Chicken Run and worked on Shrek 2. He did a good job.Vox(Orlando Jones)was an especially great character and I loved seeing Sienna Guillory (Eragon, Love Actually) again, even though she had a very small part. I was enchanted with Samantha Mumba, an Irish-Zambian beauty in her first film. Will be looking for more of her.Good film, but then to me there is no such thing as a bad time travel movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, time travel... a concept that has fascinated man-kind for many generations(offered as evidence, the fact that Wells wrote about it, a man who died half a century before this film was made), led to many an interesting debate, theories, and yes, some good stories in various forms of media. Is time fluid, is it a straight line, can we truly change occurrences, and is time travel even a realistic possibility? However, for how many good, thought-provoking, food-for-thought-serving, awe-inspiring stories there are done, there are, of course, also many that are... not. This isn't really bad, it's just not great, either. It looks good, no argument there, and it does manage to be exciting and entertaining some of the time. The filming and editing help show gorgeous scenery as well as add intensity to the scenes that aim for that. The pacing is reasonable, if the film seems longer than the 90 minutes that it is. Acting ranges, but isn't too bad. Not sure I realized Orlando Jones could play it so straight. The special effects are amazing, almost without exception. The production design is excellent. The film definitely creates some beautiful imagery. Direction is done by Simon Wells, H.G.'s great-grandson, and that's about all there is about him... he did a few animated features, including Prince of Egypt, none of which I believe I have seen. I've neither read the original nor seen any of the other versions, so I can't say how closely the story is followed. All in all, entertaining enough, and definitely good-looking, so if that's what you're up for, hey, go for it. I recommend this to fans of the people involved and those who enjoy looking at visually appealing imagery. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really frustrating film: it just could have been so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not read the original book or seen the earlier film, and indeed knowing nothing about the storyline of either of those or the current film, I came to this film with an open mind.It's really difficult to know where to start a comment on the film, because the whole thing seems so confused. It seems like there is a point or a message or something in the film, but what that is remains completely obscure.The effects were fantastic and very well judged. The idea was set up really well with the motivation for time travel clearly made out. However, it was downhill from here.All of the time travel seems to have only the vaguest connection to the quest that was set out at the start. There are some nice ideas, but they seem to be isolated occurrences that really do not flow and make the film seem disjointed and lost. At one point one wonders whether the main story in the film is the fate of the moon.When Hartdegen arrives in 802,701 A.D., the film becomes very frustrating as he seems to be unable to discover anything of importance about the Eloi, and while it seems clear that there is something to find out, what it is remains annoyingly elusive. This is quite an odd change from the previous time travel instances and one wonders why all of this has suddenly been abandoned for what seems like a completely new story. So many things happen that there should be an explanation for, but there is no discovery. I really, really wanted to know what the film was "getting at", what there was to uncover, but to no avail. Having read a summary of what happens in the book at this point, it seems like there has been a very half-hearted attempt to render this in the film but it has been so simplified and "dumbed down" that the meaning and context is completely lost.Just as we hope that we are finally to discover where this is all leading, the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction, and becomes a mindless action film without any real action. It is as if by this point the director has simply given up bothering to put any meaning into the film. By now countless significant things are happening without any explanation. Hartdegen fails to take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for no reason, and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel for no reason. The film comes to an abrupt end as Hartdegen decides to stay with the Eloi.In summary, after a good start the film is very disappointing. Too much time is spent on Hartdegen's adventures before arriving with the Eloi. However, the worst part of the film is what I think is the most important part: the setting up of the situation with the Eloi. The whole point is completely missed, and this undermines the rest of the film. After this the film concentrates too much on effects and action and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place. With so many things happening without explanation, the film just seems to get lost and lose direction. However, the finale where Hartdegen decides he is no longer bothered about time travel is the most inexplicable of all.Ultimately, the whole film seemed like a collection of unconnected incidents. The meaning and context was lost, although the gaping hole where it should have been was very obvious. What was so frustrating about it all, though, was that there was clearly so much potential here: it wasn't by any means a bad film, it just so easily could have been so much better. The start was very promising, the time travelling looked fantastic and would have worked had it not gone off on tangents, and Hartdegen's experience with the Eloi could so easily have worked had a few more of the right questions been asked, and had there not been such a temptation to "dumb down" and simplify. I just wish I had a time machine so that I could travel back in time and advise against the mistakes that were made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I'm sure worse films have been made, The Time Machine sticks out like a sore thumb. The film, in a nutshell, was horrible. I don't understand why, first of all, the stinkin' thing was nominated for an Academy Award. The makeup was terrible. I distinctly remember making the comment, "Looks like someone has been going the 'The Lord of the Rings' trash dumpster." The makeup wasn't the worst part of the movie, though. The story was pretty bad. I correct myself... the storyTELLING was really bad. The director managed to thoroughly and completely convince us as an audience, the the girl he met in the beginning was the one true girl for him. That he could never love someone else. That alone, was good storytelling. BUT, to turn around and (spoiler?) kill her off, have him travel through time, and hit it off with some native girl, hardly did justice to the budding romance in the beginning. There was no closure for that love. Sure, he secluded for several years, but that didn't do it. In essence, he went back, fell for the cave woman, and never thought twice about that former love. This ruined the movie. While Mark Addy WAS pretty good looking, and gave a decent performance, this didn't save The Time Machine. Bad storytelling and terrible makeup earned this movie a "1" in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good, could have been a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie kind of irritated me. I had heard that it was really bad but rented it anyway. Thankfully I had a postive surprise in some ways, but was still disapointed in other ways. The effects and visuals are stunning, the acting is ok, and all technical stuff works. The story is also very good. Where I think the movie goes wrong is in the directing. Some scenes really work, others doesn't work at all. The reason some of the scenes don't work are usually because they seemed shortened or chopped up in the editing-process. People move from one place to another without you knowing how they got there. An example is when the main charachter hangs at the top of a very deep hole. The wall seems to have nothing to hang on to except from the stone he hangs from, and it seems like a moment where you should expect him to be saved by something special happening. Yet, one second later they just cut to him having climbed down to the bottom of the whole without explaining why. This movie is full of moments like this. A lot of things are unexplained, and it seems like the editor or director is rushing the movie forwards on a mission to make it as short as possible. But despite all this the movie is worth to rent on DVD or video because of the effects, the action and the story. Don't suspect a masterpiece, but it's well above average mostly thanks to the production values. Hate to think about the fact that in the hans of a more experienced or better director (and/or screenwriter) this could have been a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film but a little short.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of the THE TIME MACHINE is good but a little short. It doesn't drift too far away from the original story and the scenes that are added are very good. However, by the end of the movie, you can't help but want it to be a little bit longer - it definitly needs a few more time travelling scenes.But the time traveling we do see is fantastic and the effects are great. Also absent from the film is the part, in the book, when the Time Traveller travels forward in time and witnesses, pretty much, the end of the world. Overall, a great film which is just as good as the 1960 version.</fullReview>

However, the visuals are very hard to appreciate since you are constantly disturbed by the poor acting throughout the film, the truly uninspiring story and third rate dialogue.*** spoiler *** The most emotional parts of the movie was when his girlfriend was killed, unfortunately the emotion i felt both times was relief. Which made me wonder where that reaction places me on the normality scale. Luckily some reviews on IMDB confirmed that it was a normal reaction. *** spoiler ***I find it hard to understand how anyone not being a relative to the cast or an employee at the studio can manage to enjoy this movie at all.

		<fullReview>Oh my god was this a waste of my precious time. I had a bad feeling going into this movie. But really, nothing could have prepared me for this odyssey of utter lack of ... well... anything really.Despite his great performance in Memento, Guy Pearce shows an amazing lack of proper acting in this movie. Well he didn't convince me anyway. But then again, that might've been a director problem. On the other hand, how would anyone be able to take a movie like this serious, even the actors in it?One thing this movie does however show. That the IMDB user ratings can't be trusted at all. 5.5% of the people who've seen this movie gave it 10... 10!! 10 in my book is the best movie of all time. At LEAST it has to be my the top 10 for it to get a 10.Listen to me, and listen good. If you gave this movie 10 then there's three options. Either you're the director, in which case you should stop making movies and do gardening or something, or you're clinically insane and you should seek help. Or third, you just plain don't know a damn thing about movies.Go see Fight Club. Your time will be well spent and you'll save yourself this scar on your mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was no point in remaking The Time Machine. The 1960 George Pal version is superior in imagination, storytelling and special effects. It is also far more emotionally involving and thought-provoking. This remake is just stupid. It appears to have been written and directed by cretins. Stick with the original, which is still one of the most charming and inventive scifi flicks ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in all, the movie was...okay. The special effects were great, but the movie seemed to be missing something. Perhaps it was because my expectations were set higher (thinking back on them, I guess I was expecting the purpose of the time travel would be for scientific reasons and/or to stop a villain, not as a way to prevent the main character's (Alexander) girlfriend from dying).The movie started off slow, focusing more upon the love between Alexander and his girlfriend (the character's name currently evades me and I cannot tell by looking at the cast list). Then his girlfriend's life is suddenly taken away from them, motivating Alexander to build a time machine in order to bring her back. Eventually, he built the time machine but found that you cannot cheat death (i.e., he could not protect her regardless what he's done).============================ Spoiler alert(?)If he could not prevent her death, then why not take her into the future, just a few years later? For fear of paradox? Well, his travelling back to the past and interfering could cause a paradox.End of spoiler alert.============================ By this time, that's what I thought the movie would be about -- his going back and forth through time trying to save her all kinds of different ways, but fortunately that was not the case.Eventually, he travels forward through time, including to our near-future (about 30 years, give or take). He was hoping to find an answer that would help him save his girlfriend. He didn't stay long, but things did begin to get interesting.Then after an accident, he was propelled into the distant future (80,000 years). The bulk of the movie seems to have taken place during this time. Here, he meets up with a group of primitives called the Eloi and a race of genetically engineered (sub-)humans called the morlocks.Near the climax, the storyline became confusing. I'm not sure if that was due to the writing or the 90min time frame. Perhaps on a second viewing, it would become clearer. But because the storyline became confusing, it lost some of its appeal. I do not want to go any further for fear of giving away the main part of the storyline.As mentioned above, the special effects were amazing; I just wish that we were able to see more of them, especially the landscape rendering. Those scenes were absolutely cool.The time machine, on the other hand, was not that great. They had talked about how it was the most elaborate prop designed to date, but I didn't care for it; it just did not have the "feel" of a time machine to it. For example, consider "Back to the Future." There, they used a sports car to represent a time machine, a device that once it reached a certain speed was capable of tearing through the space/time barrier.For the record, I thought I'd provide my views on time travel. I believe that it could be possible to travel back to the past, but it would only be like looking through a window: you could see what's happening but could do nothing about it since it had already occurred. As for the future, I do not believe that it would be possible because it is not yet written and I do not believe that we are destined to follow one path (i.e., each decision made could create an alternate future/reality).This movie could have been much better. Although the story is a remake, I think this sort of story should have focused more upon the time travel itself rather than one or two specific timelines. 7 out of 10.============================ Spoiler alert (again)1. Why couldn't Alexander use the time machine to save Mara from being kidnapped?2. Why didn't he use the time machine to help save the moon? Sure, Mara may never have been born, but then neither would the morlocks. Perhaps he would have found a timeline that could have told him how he could have saved his girlfriend.3. Aside from the morlocks, why is it that the human race has not evolved after 800,000 years? Especially considering the environmental difficulties shown to us.4. How is it that after 800,000 years that Mara was able to speak (near-)perfect English? Sure, her family was devoted to keeping that ancient language alive, but without regularly using it, you'd think she'd maybe know 1 out of a 100 words.5. When is the sun expected to go nova or explode? Will the Earth even be around 800,000 years from now?============================</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Critics were right to pan! (Frequent spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential, Memento) stars as Alexander Hartdegen in this adaption of H.G. Well's popular novel, 'The Time Machine'. The film is also a remake of a 1960 version of the book. Director Simon Wells is the great-grandson of H.G. Wells, and puts his own spin to the popular book in his version. In this film, Alexander proposes marriage to his girlfriend Emma (Sienna Guillory), but tragedy looms for him on this night as she is killed by a mugger. Four years later, Alexander invents a time machine to travel back in time to save Emma, but again she dies under different circumstances. He then decides to travel to the future to find the answer of the "time paradox" in why he cannot change the past. This is where Alexander's adventure begins.I have not read the book and I've only seen bits and pieces of the original 1960 version, so I cannot compare this film to anything! I was hesitant about seeing this version due to bad reviews! Well, the beginning of the film started off slow, and Guy Pearce seemed a little out of place. It seemed a little stilted at first, and I did not like the transition from Emma's death to "four years later"- especially when Philby (Mark Addy) confronts Alexander about his reclusiveness. Things got a little better when the time travel sequences begun, and we see some neat effects but they are too brief. Enter Vox (Orlando Jones), a computerized hologram in the New York public library in 2030, and things start to really get corny. When Alexander travels further into the future, he discovers the moon breaks apart and falls to earth, and then he travels to the 800 thousand and something where during this time-travel, we literally see the planet change form. This is a visual feast here for effects buffs! In the year, 800 000, is where a primitive race of humans survivors live on cliff edges and we are introduced to Samantha Mumba's character. These humans are called the Eloi (sp?), but underground, below the earth's surface, there is the fearsome mutated Morlocks who feed off the Eloi. Alexander must protect the Eloi from the evil Morlocks, yet he must find out how they came about. You get the drift?!? MAJOR SPOILER HERE Well, my suspension of disbelief was definitely pushed in the storyline when Vox reappeared in year 800 000. Now, I'm hoping the book wasn't based this far in the future because I also think it's fairly arrogant to suggest humans would be around for this long. Regardless, I excepted this but when Vox appeared again in that time, the movie completely lost me at this point. I just kept thinking "how convenient", a hologram with an entire library of human-history in his mind somehow survives a ridiculously enormous amount of time, and can teach the Eloi people his knowledge. How convenient for the story! And I thought the remake of 'Planet of the Apes' pushed the story-line and "suspension of disbelief" but 'The Time Machine' took the cake here. So, I was annoyed with Vox returning!Overall, the film wasn't great, in fact, it was pretty stupid! Guy Pearce doesn't give his best performance here, and the overall pacing of the film seemed uneven and distant. The storyline and dialogue was obvious and corny. Simon Wells representation of an early 20th century man seeing the future wasn't awesome enough. You never really felt that Alexander had a sense of wonder when he observed the future and the past. The viewer wasn't really engaged on a personal level with the characters. The score wasn't great either, yet the cinematography and effects was quite good! Unfortunately the bad aspects of the film really outweighed the positives ones. The Morlocks looked cool, but weren't scary and the Uber-Morlock (Jeremy Irons) was just plain dumb- it didn't work for me yet Irons walks through the dialogue with ease. Samantha Mumba was actually quite good in her role. Mark Addy was simply wallpaper, as was his character! Orlando Jones was reasonable but he had an extremely annoying and stupid character in Vox. There are more flaws in 'The Time Machine', but the main ones I've outlined. The critics were right in this case, and 'The Time Machine' takes the title of worse re-imagining of 2002! ** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why does everyone hate this movie? Because it took place ten years after the book took place and in new york? I don't get it. I, personally, LOVED this movie. I enjoyed it more then I enjoyed the book, mostly because the book was pretty depressing. The ending manages to be creepy, cool, exciting, and follow the book to a certain degree (the inside of the morlocks' cavern looks just as it should). The Time Machine was a character in itself and the human characters were well acted, but the movie belongs to the time machine and Jeremy Irons. He was SO creepy and really deserves to be nominated for best supporting acter. In short, DON'T see this movie if you are obsessed with the book or the 1960's version, but see this movie if you are not a member of the time machine cult.P.S. Hey, Stan Winston did the morlocks, what more do you want?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyed it so much more than the BORING, cheesy 1960 Pal version which film geeks consider so wonderful and I don't. The 1960 version suffers from idiocy and come on, try selling a movie where in the future everybody has blond hair and blue eyes! I think this version is much more respectable and believable in that regard and I appreciate Simon Wells for having the courage to bring that out. I found this movie so enchanting and exciting, the special effects ` were mind blowing. Some of the victorian scenes are soooo beautiful that it seems to take you right there. Alexander Hartdegan lives in New York during that time and we find him as a teacher in love and getting ready to propose. Guy Pearce brings just the right amount of nervous energy, shyness and resolve needed to make his character believable and Sienna Guillory did well also.The shot of the moon breaking up is so cool, wow. I'd like to see the movie just for that alone again! When Alexander finds himself in 802,701 after a tragedy he meets the beautiful Eloi. They live in one of the most beautifully rendered visual settings of the future I've ever seen, I can't see how anyone couldn't be satisfied with this movie's wonderful imagery. The romantic story worked well, we see him meet up with the Eloi Mara, played well by first timer in movies Samantha Mumba. From then things really heat up with the frightening Morlocks entering the picture and a terrific showdown.I recommend this movie if you're the type who knows how to ENJOY a movie instead of going in just to find fault because it doesn't give science lessons, history lessons, etc. Just a good, feel good, clean movie! Great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I liked it, whats the big deal? Just days before I saw The Time Machine I went to the video store and rented the old 1960 Time Machine movie. After seeing the original I found it to be both extremely lame and somewhat slow and drowsy, so, After watching the original I wondered how well the remake could keep in the same story line(previding that mankind didn't destroy itself with nuclear war during the 60's as the old film suggested).Having said that I knew there were going to be changes to the plot(they just had too for it to make sense).My point being, that I expected it to be totaly different from the original,move at a faster pace, have better specail effects, and have a slightly different story line.I didn't expect all the splenderous costumes and the absolutely beautiful early 1900's New York backdrop- that was very pleasant surprise. the actors did very well. The plot followed the origianl much closer than I expected it too, however they added a new demention to the story(the idea that he was going through time to save his girlfriend - and when he couldn't he went searching through time to find out why he could change destiny). I didn't have a problem with them writers and producers adding that to the story. If anything that gave it a deeper meaning. I thought everything was well done in this film. My only real complaint is that it didn't last but only 90 minutes. and because the film is so short, when you see the first credits come on the screen you are sitting there thinking to yourself "Is that all of it?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I still find the original version of 1960 better than this remake, they've done a good job. The original movie followed the book very closely, while this remake is filled with some fresh new ideas. The only thing I didn't like about the remake: 1) The CGI effects of the Morlocks. Last year's remake of Planet of the Apes had the apes jumping in very unbelievable ways. The Morlocks in The Time Machine remake jump even more unbelievable and sometimes very woody (you just can see clearly it's CGI). The only reason why I think that the makers of this remake made the Morlocks jump so high and move so fast is because it should look more scarier. Well, NOT!!!!!! What did I like about this remake: 1) A lot of the CGI effects, but that figures, because it's ILM. 2) Jeremy Irons' performance. 3) The setdesigns. 4) The costumes. 5) The acting. What did I like most: 1) Guy Pierce's Alexander Hartdegen had better reasons for building the timemachine than the Alexander of the original movie; 2) Guy Pierce's Alexander Hartdegen had also better reasons for staying in the year ?????? than the Alexander character of the original movie. Overall, I would give this movie a 7,5/8. Well done!</fullReview>

For once go to see a movie, for what it is. "ITS JUST A MOVIE". So what, if it doesn't explain all the fundamental causality issues that are inherit to time travel movies, I'm glad it didn't. I went in to see a special effect movie with some decent action, which is exactly what it was. SPOILER...The movie also explored some different doomsday scenarios (the Moon disaster) that to my knowledge has never been done before, it was different and in movies today anything different is good. But then again I'm living in a world where Moulin Rouge is nominated for best picture, I guess people can't distinguish between entertainment and crap. If you want to watch a movie that realistically deals with time travel see "Twelve Monkeys", if you want a fun, "put you your brain on hold" popcorn movie see the "The Time Machine". *** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whew, it took a while, but i've read all of the other comments here and i have to say i agree with the vast majority of them which are pretty disappointed with this movie for the most part. Obviously, this was never going to be a re-hash of the original movie, and some of the updates actually work reasonably well for a modern audience (i'm thinking of the hologram assistant in place of the speaking 'rings' in the original movie), but even this didn't have the cinematic impact of the original. I felt the movie could never decide what it wanted to be - was it Victorian, American, or what? Some people had bizarre American/English accents, others plumy English accents, and Mrs Whatchits awful Scots accent. And all the while people strolling about in Victorian costume! This created a mixed up feel to the movie that just confused things unnecessarily.The casting was odd - Guy Pearce was passable but unremarkable as the time traveller, and Philby's character never really had much to say at all. Samantha Mumba couldn't shed her Irish accent which just made for a strange vision of the future. The plot had some inconsistencies which bothered me. How did the Eloi manage to learn the complete English language after 800,000 years from some stone fragments which were left after the destruction of civilization? Why has the human race not evolved physically (apart from the Morlocks) after all this time? Where was the hologram guide obtaining his power? And how did his glass screen remain intact when entire cities and towns have disappeared? Why did Irons's character look different from the rest of the Morlocks? (I think this might have been partially explained, but not very well). Why did Irons's character appear to age rapidly and decompose when he fell out of the time machine if Alex was going BACK in time? Wouldn't he have gotten younger and younger and then just 'cease' to exist? How did Alex manage to destroy the Morlocks at the end of the film and not the Eloi? Surely if they were all sharing the same time, which they were, then they would all be killed? Anyway, maybe someone can let me know if they can answer these questions. Apart from the plot problems, i do agree with some of the other reviews that suggest the movie ended too abruptly; there was not the conclusion that the original offered us. However, i did like the look of the Morlocks, and the Eloi village was artfully crafted. In summary, a good entertaining and thought-provoking romp for an evening, but an ultimately forgettable flick without endurance the of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea why so many reviewers are slamming this movie, I thought it was great from start to finish. There are a few things that I had problems with or I thought could have been done better, but nothing that I can't live with, no movie is PERFECT. I thought the story was very interesting and had some really cool ideas to it. It's hard to talk about it without giving away some major plot points, but I'll just say that I liked the story. The acting was just fine, I was a bit skeptical when I saw that Samantha Mumba was in the movie, I'm getting a little sick of the musicians-turned-actors, but I thought she did a good job. Guy Pearce and Jeremy Irons did a fine job in the film too. Jeremy Irons wasn't on screen very much, so don't get your hopes up if you're a huge fan, but he did a great job with the time that he did have. The special effects were very nice throughout the film, there are a few times where they obviously used computer graphics for the Morlocks, but usually it looked pretty good. All in all, I thought it was a very good film and there was little for me to complain about. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Novelist H.B. Wells was a man of vision, so it's somehow ironic that all these years later his own great-grandson, Simon Wells, would direct an adaptation of one of his novels, and bring it to the screen with such a lack of imagination. Because, despite a bit of flash, `The Time Machine' that Wells gives us is just another Sci-Fi movie that doesn't mean much, and simply isn't that entertaining. And the problem lies in the fact that Simon, unlike H.G., lacked the vision he needed to make this a viable commodity; he lost the metaphor, and with it, the film. Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) has invented a machine that-- he hopes-- is capable of time travel; and for it's maiden voyage, he visits the past in an attempt to alter a devastating event in his personal life. When he comes to the conclusion that it is impossible to change the past, however, he decides to try the future where, perhaps, he will find the answer to his dilemma. But what he finds, 800,000 years in the future, is a civilization turned against itself, with a society defined by two distinct factions: Those who live on the surface of the earth, and those who dwell in the darkness beneath it. And all that's left of the world Alexander knew is a few remnants of what is now an ancient and inexplicably inconsequential past. It's now a world of light governed by the dark; a world in which it is doubtful that he will find the answers he seeks. Very doubtful, indeed, because throughout the film Wells is seemingly unable to figure it out himself. Early on, you have to wonder what it is, exactly, that he's trying to tell us here. Where is he going with this? The initial sequences, in which Alexander goes back in time, plays out like an episode of `The Twilight Zone,' but then the film switches gears and blasts! into the future, propelled by fairly anemic motivation on the part of the protagonist. The screenplay (by John Logan) is uninspired and unimaginative, with a plot that is so convoluted it fails to maintain much interest. It's one of those movies that, while you're watching, you keep waiting for it to really kick in and get started-- and it never does. Instead, they take us to a future with a setting that looks borrowed from the remake of `Planet of the Apes,' where we're introduced to a bunch of people, the Eloi, who live on the sides of some cliffs, but aren't particularly interesting by any means. There's nothing especially enigmatic about them, nor are they apathetic to what's going on around them. If they were either of these, it might spark some interest, but it just isn't happening.  And when we meet the Morlocks, those who live underground, it doesn't help matters any. These are supposedly the other half of the human race, but there's nothing about them that looks human at all; they look more like beasts born of a Wes Craven/Stephen King collaboration. But then we meet the `Uber' Morlock (Jeremy Irons) who is one of the more highly evolved members of the family, with powers that one would think could've enabled him to improve their living conditions a bit. By this time, however, you've probably finished your popcorn and could care less. As Alexander, Guy Pearce gives new definition to the `absent minded professor' character, and does it in a way that is unconvincing and with a presentation that is rather pretentious. In a film that demands you suspended disbelief in the first place, his portrayal does nothing to help in that regard. It's hard to believe that the Alexander Pearce creates has the resolve, resourcefulness, drive or tenacity to undertake such an adventure as this. And there's nothing about him that would lead us to believe that those in the future will be any better off for having encountered him. He just doesn't come across as a guy who's going to make a difference. It's obvious that Pearce was attempting to create something unique with this character, or at least had something specific in mind, and for that you have to give him credit. But as it is with any artistic endeavor, it doesn't always work. And this one didn't. There is a positive aspect to this film, however, and it's the performance of singer Samantha Mumba, as Mara, the girl of Alexander's future. She has a definite screen presence and an affecting, natural delivery, all of which should insure a successful career as an actress, should she decide to pursue that path further. The fact that she was able to create a memorable character in such an insipid film as this speaks volumes about her ability and talent, and hopefully, she will opt for more work in film. The supporting cast includes Mark Addy (Philby), Phyllida Law (Housekeeper), Omero Mumba (Kalen), Sienna Guillory (Emma) and Orlando Jones as Vox, a kind of hologram/encyclopedia (and another of the more ridiculous aspects of this film, especially after you think about it for awhile and really put it into context). A film that will be remembered primarily for wasting the talents of Pearce, Jones and especially Jeremy Irons, `The Time Machine' is a misfire destined to be one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of the year. And it's a shame, because the filmmakers had all the tools with which to work, but didn't know what to do with them. Even the F/X were disappointing, which is surprising, given all the resources available to a big-budget production such as this. It's interesting that the tag line for this film is `Where would you go?' because the answer seems so obvious. But if there's any doubt, let me jump in here and say, `To any movie other than this one--' I rate this one 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Equals the 1960 version: A worthy remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a review by someone who has seen this version of the Time Machine before he saw the earlier (original version). Well, both are good and there is no "better" in my opinion. However this version IS better in terms of scenery and visuals. Sound effects are also more in accordance with today's standards.The stories themselves are also different, in two aspects: a) This is more of a love story(-ies) and less of a social criticism story, although it does include the same allegories that the first did, but in a slightly more subtle tone. b) This time the Eloi look much more like the the Avatar's race in character and lifestyle rather than blonde-blue-eyed people in factory/school uniforms.I believe that the younger folks will prefer this version while the older folks will prefer the previous one. That is mostly because this version is faster paced and the characters look, behave and talk more like today's people do and also the ideas that are implied throughout are more relevant by todays standards. Simply put, Samantha Mumba is more likely to attract this generation's men, while Yvette Mimieux is more likely to attract the previous generations. Sienna Guillory on the other hand, reconciles all generations :PPS. The original version getting 2 more points in rating I think is attributed to the originality rather than the superiority of the original. So choose according to your age!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashy story based on Wells' Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1960 version by George Pal has stop-motion effects that seem dated now, especially compared to the dazzling images we see on the screen here, and yet I kind of prefer the earlier version. It was dated, pedantic, and simple -- or simple minded, if you like. But that very simplicity made it easier to follow the plot and to understand the points that Wells was eager to make. This version is longer, better acted, but is filled with action, some of it gory, that Pal's version wasn't very concerned with.Neither version, I gather, was that close to Wells' original. Pal's was closer in depicting the Eloi as an air-headed white-bread society with pink skins. This one is more realistic. The Eloi seem to be a mixed race. They look vaguely Polynesian -- what with body tattoos, pareus, and cowrie shells. In fact their culture looks like that of the Samoans and so do many of the Eloi themselves. If you took a sample of genes from all three major racial stocks, put them in a blender, and dumped them out on a table, they'd look like Samoans, which is not the worst fate in the world. Mara (whatever happened to Weena?) doesn't look quite as corruptly innocent as Yvette Mimieux but we can live with that.Guy Pearce is pretty good. He has a commanding face, prognathous and full of masculine bone structure, and his performance is quite different from that in "L.A. Confidential," the only other work of his that I've seen. Jeremy Irons has a bit part as the Uber-Morlock, the brains of the subterranean outfit, so to speak. He's given what I guess are philosophical points to make in his brief appearance but I must be slow because I didn't get them.The problem with these films is that they both throw away Well's reasons for why things turned out the way they did. Capitalism has led to a two-tier society (the eaten and the eaters), and evolution (still a controversial idea) had its way for reasons that Wells spelled out. All of that is missing. We don't get any reasons for the lack of sexual bifurcation in the Eloi, nor any reason for their empty-headedness. Instead, we are given the Eloi as is -- "Here they are, folks!" No hint whatever that they are the descendants of the worn-out wealthy class of earlier days.I don't mean that this film should have been a series of lectures on the future physical and cultural evolution of our society. Just that certain questions and answers could easily have been built into the story itself, particularly if some of the violent scenes, unnecessarily long, had been elided. And what the hell is the black, stinky, gooey stuff on those blowgun darts anyway? It can knock down a full-grown man but it only frightens a little girl.Overall impression: Not bad, not insulting, but it looks as if it were the consequence of a meeting of a board of MBAs who began by asking, "What NEW story is there that we can juice up with modern computer-generated images? The Time Machine? Great! Cannibalism and a destroyed earth -- a bonanza of fireworks!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, maybe once a year. I see a movie like this. A movie that had some potential (decent setup, decent story, good actors) but still failed so totally. A movie where i don't know whether i should laugh or cry.The inventor Alex Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is struck by an unfortunate accident in which his lover is taken away from him. Desperate to reverse time and stop the accident he begins construction of a time machine. When he uses the time machine though something goes very wrong and he is thrown hundreds of thousands of years into the future.Right from the beginning it's obvious that this is not a low-budget movie. The technical quality is quite refined and the special effects look very nice. The story however is a complete mess. After what i understand this is an update of a 1960's movie, and both movies were based on a novel by H.G. Wells. In that case i have to say that H.G. Wells probably didn't do his best work here. To say that the story is implausible is the understatement of the century. A complete mess would be a better description.Of course it's hard to say how the film-makers treated the original material (i haven't read the novel). But still they must have been able to do something better with it than this. This just makes no sense whatsoever. Also Guy Pearce is completely wasted here. He's a good actor when he get's the chance to show it. But here he just looks more or less stunned through the whole movie. Not to mention Jeremy Irons who appears in heavy makeup just before the end. I don't know any other actor who can travel so fast from amazing to crap. Here he is dealt an impossible role and probably tries to handle it as best he can. The end result though is just as much crap as the rest of this movie.This is an 80 million dollar, 1,5 hour long endurance test. Avoid it. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many films The Time Machine will not be taken solely on its own merits. It will always be compared with the original 1960 version. (The Planet of the Apes remake is another recent example). Whilst the 2002 version has all the aids of modern technology, giving up to date special effects, it lacks the superior plot of the original, nor does it have a leading actor like Rod Taylor from the 1960 version, who is able to make his mark on the film. It is not a film I would wish to watch more than once. Although Science Fiction is my favourite category, it fell well short of my expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Still Can't Put H.G.'s Work Effectively On Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1961 is more intriguing than the original version but still nothing worth adding your DVD collection. At least it was better than I anticipated. Neither, however, live up to the author's novel. In two tries, the film world is yet to produce a movie worthy of H.G. Wells' writing. The same goes for "War Of The Worlds."This updated version had a couple of things going for it: 1 - It didn't overstay its welcome at 96 minutes; 2 - it has some good monster-like villains who are fun to watch. No, it's not the "thought-provoking" film of 1961 but it's far more entertaining. Guy Pearce is a good replacement for Rod Taylor but Samanta Mumbo (who???) for Yvette Mimieux? No thanks.</fullReview>

The murlocks were better but not as explained as you'd like them to be. On the other hand, the time traveller and the time machine are far better, further devilling into why he is searching through time. The end of the world catastrophe was far more imaginative and the concept of time travel far more well explained. A few people will get mad that its a re-make of the original, which for some unknown reason is a crime, but it's still worth watching. For the sci-fi more than the underlying message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as good as the original but still enormous fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original version is my seventh favourite film of all time. While this film is nowhere near as good as its predecessor, it is also nowhere near as bad as it is made out to be. It rollicks along at a great pace and is enormous fun from start to finish. The film is well directed by H.G. Wells' great-grandson Simon Wells and Gore Verbinski, who replaced him for the last 18 days of the shoot as he was suffering from exhaustion. I don't know who directed what scenes so I can't really get specific in my critique but I will say that the direction seemed perfectly consistent. When it comes to the writing, there are a few plot holes but none of them impacted on my enjoyment of the film.Guy Pearce is a very good lead as the time traveller Alexander Hartdegen, even if the character's journey from an eccentric professor to an action hero over the course of a few days - relatively speaking - is a little hard to believe. Samantha Mumba is very natural as his Eloi love interest Mara. One thing that she does very well is deliver the Eloi dialogue as if it were an actual language. The same is true of her real life younger brother Omero as Kalen. He is quite good in the role but, perhaps unsurprisingly, he is at his best in his scenes with his sister. Their chemistry comes through very clearly, particularly in the scene when she comforts him after his nightmare. Jeremy Irons is suitably creepy in his cameo as the Über-Morlock and the film has three strong supporting actors in Mark Addy, Orlando Jones and Phyllida Law. Sienna Guillory is the weakest link but she has only a small role so that's okay. I loved Alan Young's "blink and you'll miss it" appearance as the florist! I have actually met both Irons and Samantha Mumba and they're both very nice.When it comes to the Eloi and the Morlocks, the film largely lacks the novel and the 1960 film's social commentary but the fact that none of the Eloi are white may have been intended as a commentary on the way that ethnic minorities are and were mistreated, as in the "Planet of the Apes" films. The first of those is referenced to the Morlocks' hunting of the Eloi. Speaking of which, I loved the design of the Spy Morlocks but I wasn't too gone on that of the Hunter Morlocks. The Über-Morlock's was very good except for his brain stretching down his back, which I thought was a bit silly. The time machine itself is a beautiful design but you can't beat the 1960 version. The CGI was very impressive for its time and the time travel effects are one of the highlights of the film. There are some lovely references to the original film, my favourite being the Über-Morlock aging rapidly and eventually crumbling to dust when outside the machine's temporal bubble. Not sure what the point of relocating the action to New York was though, especially since Jones is the only major American cast member. Incidentally, Alexander's first future pit-stop is May 24, 2030, which will be my 43rd birthday! Overall, the film is a very enjoyable film which is very good as remakes go. I wish that "Planet of the Apes" (2001), a remake of my sixth favourite film of all time, or "Star Trek: Nemesis", another 2002 film written by John Logan, were as much fun as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Great Scene And That Was It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The newer version of The Time Machine was interesting, but could have been so much better. Granted a "fleshing out" of the story is mandatory, based on the brief novella by H.G. Wells, by both versions of the movie. Some strange directions the newer version took were the Eloi being darker-skinned people, with many "African themes" throughout, their cliffside homes, and the Morlocks are now a threat both night and day (!) Lead actor Guy Pearce was miscast in my view, and just didn't project as the hero/adventurer in this film as expected. I also didn't understand the physics of the dramatic ending; how the time machine could self-destruct and only destroy the lair of the Morlocks and nothing else (?) There was one memorable scene, very well done, that had me wishing the entire film had been this innovative: at the end where it shows past and present superimposed on each other, Guy Pearce's friend and maid, along with Guy Pearce in his new life role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is a scientist living in 1899 NYC. He proposes to his girlfriend Emma, but she's killed in a robbery. Four years later, he builds a time machine. However when he tries going back to rescue Emma, she is killed in a different way. Disenchanted, he travels forward in time to 2030 to search for a way to change the past. However he finds nothing about time travel. He jumps forward another 7 years to find the world in collapse and chaos after the moon is destroyed. He tries to use his time machine again but an explosion knocks him out. The machine keeps running until 802,701 AD when he regains consciousness.The movie works well for awhile, but the future world of Eloi and Morlock is a bit of a letdown. It takes the H. G. Wells world and makes a Planet of the Apes movie out of it. In the end, the well-made movie is let down by this. Also there is an uncompelling action ending. The movie just has nothing profound to say, and is a barely functional action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What If</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to review this without referring to the classic, albeit with some flaws, 1960 Original cinematic version of 'The Time Machine'. I adore that film but that review is for another day, do forgive one or two mentions though.Here, HG Wells' Great Grandson, directs this mediocre remake. This film could have been brilliant with the right screenplay and direction. Sadly it lacks in many departments. Don't get me wrong! I love anything to do with 'The Time Machine' and this isn't awful. It is just not great! Guy Pearce's Alexander Hartdegan isn't very likable from the offset but the film does take an interesting path to begin with. Hartdegan goes to the park to meet with Emma, his girlfriend to ask her to marry him. Sadly, they get mugged and she gets shot and killed in the fight. The film then goes forward four years to 1903 and this is where the film begins to rush a little. Though Hartdegan is an inventor, we all of a sudden get a reveal of a time machine. Now i can understand an inventor taking four years and mulling over changing the past but there are so many questions at that point. How does the machine run? On what? What materials? It certainly looks out of place that someone could source that type of material in the early 1900's. Silly points maybe but it felt very rushed.He returns to 1899 to meet Emma earlier in the day at the park on the day of her murder and saves her life. Remember, he would already be at the park later wondering where she is. Sadly, she gets killed again, but this time by a runaway horse. Alex soon realises either time or God is putting things right and he can't change the past. It seems, though, that he only tries once! Of course the paradox is that if he saves Emma, he wouldn't build the time machine so how would he saved Emma. This is a nicely paced section it must be said. A couple of mentions here. One for Sienna Guillory who lights up the screen as Emma. It is such a shame we didn't get more airtime of her or the possibility of multiverses/timelines caused by Alex's actions. Also, there is a nice cameo for Alan Young, who played Filby in the 1960 version.Alex then goes into the future to try and find the answer to why he can't change the past. This is where the film falls apart for me. First of all he stops in 2030 and visits a holographic library internet played by Orlando Jones. Call me fickle but Alex asks him about time travel and he quotes The Time Machine book written by HG Wells and the 1960 film. Now how can this work? So, the book and the film are about a man who builds a time machine and travels to the year 802,701 where he meets the Eloi and the Morlocks. Just by chance then Alexander Hartdegan builds a time machine and travels to the year 802,701 and meets the Eloi and Morlocks. You get my point. He could have just read the book! In fact, the book was published in 1895. I find it hard to believe that a University lecturer who has an interest in the mechanics of time travel hadn't read the book by 1899. Can you imagine travelling into the future and having an adventure that is fictional! I rest my case.On arriving in 802,701 Pearce's portrayal does get more likable but i just can't find a liking for Samantha Mumba's Mara or in fact Omera Mumba character at all. I have read review liking her portrayal but she is no Weena of the original. At least she played the naivety of the Eloi people well.Again, the film is rushed. The destruction of the Moon in an earlier stop off rendering the Earth mainly uninhabitable is hardly mentioned apart from the split in the species. In fact, it can be reviewed in a paragraph. Mara is kidnapped by the Morlocks taken underground. Alex visits Vox the hologram, who is still working. He tells Alex how to find the them. Alex goes off and tries to be a hero.This is where we meet an Jeremy Irons as the Uber-Morlock, who basically explains that Alex can't change the past as we already know it would create a paradox. Irons is very good and extremely creepy and once again is such a shame he was underused. I won't bore you with the details of what happens between them at the end but i will mention that it causes a time distortions in the future. Again, it is not even touched on as to the after effects of that.All in all, this film is worth watching, especially for those who are fans of the book. Though it is far from that story. There is a nice nod to HG Wells at the end where his picture can be seen in the hallway of 1903. The only actors/things who come away with any credit for their performance is Mark Addy's rendition of Filby and Irons deep portrait of his character. The Time Machine, itself, looks spectacular. In fact, it was, at the time, the most expensive prop ever made for any film! A special mention should also go to the nice score.It does raise some interesting questions about travelling into the past. Though the film never really gives you the feeling of or in fact the answer to Hartdegan's "What If" question.Do watch it, but maybe a few years after watching the classic original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*** Spoilers *** not bad as scientifically laughable morality play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost all science fiction fantasies require total suspension of disbelief.I had to step out of the room for a couple of minutes during the broadcast just as Our Hero was taking off in the coach with his dear lost girl friend, so I didn't get to see his failure to save her - but His Totally Awesome Omniscient Arrogance the Uber-Morlock (Jeremy Irons pretty much stole the show with this, few can do this sort of thing better)did a reasonable job of explaining the paradox.I liked the fact that the Eloi actually had a well-developed green culture. The impossible library computer was fun, and the evolved descendant of the soulless tyrants who have run things since the Stone Age was a wonderful addition. The moon stuff was stupid of course, and quite unnecessary as we're doing a fine job of destroying ourselves without tossing in something that couldn't result from mere nuclear construction work and should have reduced the Earth to gravel. All things considered, a fairly entertaining graft of current outlook onto a Victorian concept. I doubt Mr. Wells would have taken major issue with it. He put a couple of things in his works that he knew perfectly well made no scientific sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching this movie, and it was an OK movie. Not fantastic and not awful.It was pretty exciting all the way through, the music was super, the storyline was good enough, the special effects were great and the acting was fine. But with that said, the movie has some obvious flaws.We get to see the world and humans in different time settings multiple times, but yet we don't get a lot of information about the "new worlds". I got quite annoyed about how little was shared when he arrived on the earth 800 000 years later for example. Who were the people he met, why did they live like this, what happened to the people before? A lot of questions and not many answers. We got to know some of it, but not nearly enough to appreciate the whole travel-in-time aspect.The movie would have been a whole lot better if the the loose ends was tightened properly, but all in all an OK movie. I didn't feel like I was wasting my time, but it did't end up like my new favorite movie either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thats it, if you haven't seen the 1960 version or read the book then its safe you see it without so much disappointment. Contrary the case, then you will be all the time like: "hey, something is missing here". What i hated at most about this movie is that it was affected so much by the political and social issues that didn't exist back in 1960 when it was first made. In 1960, paranoid self-called anti-racist groups didn't exist so you could safely make a film entirely without black people and nobody complained, unlike today when you have to meet certain standards such as making sure to include an obligated minimum of individuals of each race in a movie which is the case of this film where the once blond and blue-eyed Eloi had to be replaced by black mixed with south-Asian and Latino so these audiences wouldn't feel left out. This is without doubt the stupidest aspect of this movie and one of the things that makes it so superficial and clearly a 2002-year movie.It has however certain things that complement the original, like the presence of the uber-morlock which is a great character, although maybe a little too fictional so its completely normal it was not necessary in the first version, he just wouldn't fit because of its realistic tone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, but the basic premise disappointed me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In most aspects, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The acting was spot on, the special effects were fantastic, and the time machine prop is a work of movie making art. However, when I compare the premise of the movie to the book or even the 1960 movie, I wonder why the story writers felt that some of the finer points of the story had to be changed. I understand that the future world and the destruction of the moon make that part of the story much more relative to today's audiences, but why did they feel that Alexander needed a personal tragedy to push him to create the time machine. Maybe they felt that creating the time machine out of disillusionment with mankind and pure scientific curiosity was too sophisticated for modern audiences. All things considered though, if the movie was not preceded by the book and a wonderful adaptation, it is a wonderfully entertaining movie, but falls short when compared to its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The SKG factory of social statements ruins a great novel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Ugh' is my one-word review of this crappy filmic version of the fine HG Welles story. I didn't even see that he got any acknowledgment at all, and Welles probably would think that's okay.The typical 'junk' science of the Spielbergian universe is present, along with unbelievable plot maneuvers that are overlooked by the thrill-seeking audience who only needs to waste a couple of hours eating popcorn. There's not even an effort to try to explain any of the improbabilities here, probably because the producers knew that the audience wouldn't know any better or wouldn't care.Let's take a look at some of them:1. 800,000 years into the future, through climate changes and ice ages, English is maintained as a language!! People alive now have no idea how Latin is spoken, and it's rarely offered in schools anymore, and it's only been 1,000 to 2,000 years.2. Artifacts showing words from buildings are nearly like new after almost a million years!3. The moon breaks apart due to excavation nuclear blasts in year 2037, as if that would have really been allowed!And there's so much more, but the real cause of my UGH review is the preaching of social sensibilities from the SKG Hollywood crowd that are so evident here, starting with the Kumbaya chorus at the beginning and then close of the film. There's also the wholesome and peaceful Eloi native tribe of the future, certainly similar to any number of tribal peoples in the world today or the past who do not use technology, but exist with simple tools. They have no abilities to defend themselves, but then these folks have enough engineering know-how to create complex bamboo homes resting on the sides of cliffs!This is juxtaposed with the 'industrial age' Morlocks who obviously are the stand-ins for the imperialistic Western world. Upon seeing the Morlocks, I wondered how the SKG bunch was going to present the fascist white male capitalistic corporate robber-baron boss, as the Welles novel had none of that, and then suddenly there was the vision of Jeremy Irons, as white as he could possibly be and in total control of everything.Yes, we know that the great pyramids of both the East and West were built by ancient folks, but those in Egypt were built by Kings (Pharoah) on the blood of slaves, and those in America were built by a totally fascist and warlike civilization, not to mention the human sacrifices made upon their altars.The SKG Hollywood crowd would have none of that present in any film they make, as they want their revisionist history to be accepted as fact. Students, forget about learning the truth, just believe Hollywood. Upon further consideration, I should change my rating of 2 to 1, the lowest possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two different films--I'm opting out of the second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of the Wells novel won't agree with me, but for those of us who who are not fans and know but are uninterested in the old school sci-fi plot line, I think this film's problem is different. I think it would have been terrible if they tried to follow the book exactly--this is one of those books that is so rooted in its era that it should stay a book. To adapt it faithfully would make for a totally hokey film--imagine the weak, wispy Eloi, for example. It's clear that the filmmakers were attempting to update the story by utilizing the FX technology (such as the brilliant 'librarian'). That said, I honestly think this would have been a much better film were it to have not been an adaptation whatsoever, and rather spring-boarded off the book (as in "inspired by" HG Well's novel). The premise is fascinating, and the thought that Alex could have gone to any time is full of possibilities. The bombastic year chosen by Wells just doesn't ring true in 2002.The result is that the first half of the movie and the second half are pretty much two different worlds, the second being closer to the book but more unbelievable and hokey (consider the Morlocks Attacking Eloi in the Jungle scene--laughable!). The first was so well done (Guy Pierce is great), and the middle is inspired and makes excellent use of FX (i.e. the time-traveling sequence). Then it falls apart. I would love for this have to completely launched into a different story that kept the same feel as that middle section. In a case like this, I think it's better to focus on making a successfully-illustrated story over sticking to a book's elements when you're already diverging quite a bit. I just don't think the book is adaptable in live action...but I do think it might make a highly interesting animated film. Just my two cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For those who have not read the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, I have only read a shortened version of the book that was obviously aimed at children. However, I can still say that I had been expecting more from this film. The story is as follows. A scientist in Manhattan, after the death of his love, builds a time machine in order to save her life. However, he finds this impossible, and accidentally travels 800,000 years into the future, where the human race has split into two: the Eloi, and the predatory, subterranean Morlocks. Overall, if you haven't read the book, you will probably enjoy the film. For the readers: The seemingly Utopian life and childish playfulness and naiveté of the Eloi; the subtlety and terror of the Morlocks; the hero's affection for the young, innocent Weena (and his fight to protect her from the Morlocks); the hero's unrevealed identity and life; and the ambiguity of the whole story, have all but been left out. And, although Hollywood has managed to put in at least some philosophy (very meager in comparison to written science fiction, but amazing for the American film market), the typical recurring romances and shock-value clichés, are all in place.On a happier note, the soundtrack is amazingly beautiful in places. And the shot of the moon breaking up is truly one of the most chillingly, disturbingly beautiful (if not entirely scientifically plausible) I have ever seen in the cinema. That has probably accounted for some of the stars. 5.5 to 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hollywood Machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon Wells' TIME MACHINE, H.G.'s descendant, predictably runs as is expected: basic Hollywood story of lost love, good vs. evil, and all around just so generally safe - which can be read as "mundane." The film is surprisingly (mercifully?) short, clocking in at barely 100 minutes. And what starts out as a horribly, horribly, horribly acted (even by the remarkable Guy Pearce, who is a great actor and has the resume to prove it), shot and executed beginning does become exciting once the hero jumps into the time machine for the first time. Although the story then does become nominally better, what jump starts the film, surprise-surprise, are the time travel f/ x. Two of the best f/x houses in Hollywood today, ILM and Digital Domain, show the audience what Dr. Alexander Hartdegen is viewing as time moves around him - and it is a beautiful treat. Especially enjoyable are his brief stops in the (for us 21th Century dwellers) near future years of 2030 &amp; 2037 before hightailing it to the year 802,000. In that time period the audience is treated to the Morlocks, who come across as being both cool and creepy. Stan Winston's f/x house combines both make-up and CGI to make these creatures among the true stars of the film.In typical Spielberg/Dreamworks fashion, the story caters to more adventure than, oh, bother, realism or even straight storytelling. Once in the far future, for instance, watch as a Columbia professor/bookworm becomes an action star fighting Morlocks, scaling walls and rousing the troops ala George C. Scott in PATTON... or at least Charlton Heston in PLANET OF THE APES.Ah, and Dr. Hartdegen possesses a COLOR picture of his girlfriend/fiancée. Wow! A full-color picture in 1899. THAT is some kind of science-fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witlessly wishy-washy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Pearce seems to be trying to single-handedly bring back the action-adventure genre. The release of The Count of Monte Cristo, quickly followed by The Time Machine shows a shift in his career toward good old fashioned Saturday matinee kind of movies. The Count of Monte Cristo worked on that level, unfortunately the same cannot be said for The Time Machine. While it has all the elements for success ? a strong leading man, a compelling story and good special effects ? the film cannot seem to make up its mind as to what it wants to be. Was Simon Wells (the great-grandson of author HG Wells) trying for an action film for kids, a la 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea or a sci fi / horror epic? It is hard to tell, and I wish he would have made up his mind. What is presented here is witlessly wishy-washy, despite some cool moments. It's too scary for kids, not interesting enough for grown-up science fiction fans. Far superior is George Pal's 1960 version of the same name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor plot point poisons picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although many people are skeptical about time travel, it might be possible, but just not in the way that it's presented in this movie. The concept of time travel within one timeline is for the simple minded. There are probably an infinite number of timelines that can be slightly or hugely different from each other. Think of it as a more complicated version of the TV show called "Sliders." If you found a way to go back in time, you couldn't go back within your own timeline because there is most likely a paradox barrier. Even if you weren't blocked by that barrier, there are probably an infinite number of timelines, so it would be improbable that you could ever find your own timeline to jump within. Since the only way to travel in time is to jump out of your own timeline because of the paradox barrier, there's no guarantee what reality you'll find yourself in (unless you know how to return to a reality you've been to before). For example, you may visit a timeline where Abraham Lincoln was never assassinated, he may look like a lizard-man, he may be three feet tall, or he may never have existed in the first place. The earth may not even exist in some timelines. In that case, time travel could be even more dangerous than you would think. You may be able to map as many realities as possible and return to them whenever you want, but new time jumps would be very risky and should be done using some kind of sturdy spaceship that has its own oxygen supply.It should be clear that no matter how hard you tried, there's nothing you could do to change your own past. Even if you traveled back in time and killed your father by mistake (before he met your mother), nothing would happen to you. There would be no paradoxes because any change you made would effect the people in the future of the other timeline that you were visiting. Since you cannot jump within your own timeline, skeptics are correct when they say that time travel (the way most people think of it) is impossible. Time travel is both possible and impossible, depending on how you look at it.If you can forget all of that and accept how time travel is portrayed in this movie, it still won't help you much because there is a major flaw from the start. The main character's girlfriend is killed, but he cannot accept this, so he does what most people think is impossible and invents a time machine. He goes back in time to save her and then he stupidly has her stand in a clearly dangerous spot and she is killed again. After that, he is convinced that he could come back a thousand times and she would always die. That's not very "scientific." Only a total idiot would make that assumption.He was so upset by his girlfriend's death that he bent the forces of time and space to his will, but quit trying to save her life after only one try? That's totally unbelievable. The filmmakers could have made a short montage of him going back and having her die in various ways so that we could believe he would finally quit and look to the future for an answer. If they didn't want to waste money doing that, they could have had him say that he did try a thousand times to save her, but as it is, the movie is ruined because of that one simple mistake. If you want me to believe your messed up version of time travel for the sake of the plot, I'm more than happy to, but at least have a little respect for the story.I won't bother talking about the rest of the movie too much since so many other people did such a great job ripping it apart. I will say that I wish they would have shown more from the pre-Morlock future because we mostly just saw the library. I'd even rather see more from the main character's own time than that "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome", "Waterworld", "The Postman", etc. looking Eloi world.One last thing. If you are impressed by the Morlocks and can't tell the difference between the goofy looking "real" Morlocks and the horrible CGI Morlocks, you'll love the werewolf from "An American Werewolf in Paris" and the creatures from "Jumanji."</fullReview>

The plot is OK, but not a great sci-fi film. I love Guy Pearce, but I think he was miscast in this. The special effects were average. I did get one good laugh out of this and that was when the robber just stands there and says "it was only a ring." Like a robber would do that, he would have ran like heck after he shot the girl. For some reason, that made me laugh. I also didn't get when Alex goes into the distant future and finally wakes up, he doesn't have a million questions to ask those people. Instead, he just takes in what he sees and doesn't inquire about so many things. Anyone would have asked many questions and immediatly would want to know where the time machine was.The ending was a little hokey, but I think that any time a movie has some happy fairy tale ending, esp. when it just doesn't seem right. And Samantha Mumba was nothing but eye candy in that skimpy top. Not exactly a good role to break into acting.FINAL VERDICT: Not one of the worst movies of the year. It is OK and I recommend it for those that like special effects movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS***What could have been a faithful adaptation of Wells novel turns into a complete mess save for the gorgeous Samantha Mumba and the painfully underused Jeremy Irons, whos part amounted to little more than a cameo.The first part of the film works reasonably well as we learn the reason the time machine was built( not the reason in the novel, but plausible nontheless). The advancement of time as seen from the machines cocoon works well, but from then on in it all goes pear shaped. After an all too brief stop in the year 2037 where we learn the ludicrous reason for the downfall of mankind we fast forward 800000 years to a society split into two groups- the peace loving Alia and the Morlocks whose evolutionary cycle has seen them develop into a cross between an extra from Michael Jacksons Thriller and a pitbull terrier( in less than a million years I might add). The Alia( who have kept their human appearance but reverted to living like cavemen), have accepted their lot in life as food for the Morlock,who in turn are governed by this "Uber Morlock", played by Irons- who appears to have ridden off on his own evolutionary bike and came up with a Klingon/Emperor Palpatine cross together with telepathic powers. Oh, and in these 800000 years the only remnants of our society are a holographic library database(which has developed emotion)presumably running on duracell batteries with a million year plus shelf life,a remarkably unworn Brooklyn bridge sign and an unweathered stone shop sign for Tiffanys all of which survived an ice age and the aforementioned 2037 cataclysm.Time machine has the look of a film which had Freddie Kruger as its cutting editor- its all over the place, jumping from once scene to the next without thought, no character build up and baring only the slightest nod to the original story and instead looks more like the mess of the Planet of the Apes remake.</fullReview>

Their efforts gave the original film a warmth and depth where you cared about the characters - I felt so much more engrossed in the original than this feeble re-make.The special effects were..., well, so what - I've seen it done a million times now - and it's getting bloody boring !

		<fullReview>Perhaps the reason so many of the reviewers didn't like this movie was that they weren't paying attention.I really enjoyed this movie. The acting, while not necessarily brilliant, was better then most. The pacing was good, the effects were good, and it had a reasonable plot. The end had some dialogue that seemed rather odd, but in all, I thought they did a good job with this movie. There were definitely issues, but we're talking about time travel here. An entertaining film, with less suspension of belief then some films with time travel (remember Terminator 2?)However, the constant criticism of plot incontinuity are pretty convenient when you miss major points. I didn't go past the first 20 reviews on IMDB, as virtually every one was guilty of missing some major point of the movie, or completely misunderstanding it. (Caution, spoilers) He went 4 million years in the future? Hopefully that was hyperbole, because not only did his time machine say how far in the future, two characters, at different times, TOLD US. One blissfully unaware viewer wondered why the moon had blown up. I'm not sure how he missed that point. Maybe talking on the cell phone? Another is confused why they even went that far into the future. Perhaps to explain the evolution, or that after parts of the moon crash into the earth that the planet doesn't just shrug it off. Must not watch the Discovery channel, things are crashing into the earth every other day on there.I can accept the criticisms of bad acting, maybe of bad CGI. But like I said, this is a movie about time travel. There are some things that were pretty far fetched (the valid criticism of them speaking english and the super powered Orlando Jones), but for the most part nothing unreasonable. Yet somebody still wonders why nobody invented a time machine in the future of the movie.Why did you people even go see this movie? It's a movie about time travel. And of all the movies about time travel, this one actually addresses the issues of changing the past, and also brings up some of the larger issues of changing our environment. I particularly enjoyed the movies portrayal of 2030 NYC.But for the most part, if you can use a little creativity, the plot contrivances aren't going terribly far out on a limb, and the movie works well together as a whole. I'm not sure how so many reviewers got so bent out of shape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another re-make that shouldn't have been made. I find the 1960 version to be vastly superior and think the special effects were much better. I also preferred the story outline much better in the 1960 version. It's probably unfortunate that the younger generation has not had a chance to see the earlier version to compare the two.</fullReview>

It is not that the film is bad as such, it is simply that I felt it could ahve been so much more. The 1960's version is still the best - It will reign as a masterpiece for a long time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Time Machine is a weird sort. It's bad, but not so much that I will bother to remember why. For all its fancy sets and special effects, the final result is something that goes in one of the viewer's ears and out the other. The story revolves around a scientist of the 19th century who is horrified to witness his girlfriend's death in a random mugging. He then become obsessed with building a time machine, one that can take him into the past so he can set things right. It only takes him four years, surprisingly, but when he finally flips the switch and zips back to that exact moment in time, the woman dies in a different situation. Now, I don't know about you, but if I had spent all that time building a mother lovin' time machine, I would stand very still with the girl by my side, not walking off to get flowers but...anyway, science boy goes into the future to find out why the past could not be changed. Oddly enough, when he reaches the year 2020 (or something like that), no one knows about time travel. So what the movie's basically saying is that with his extremely limited technology, our hero built this machine, but hundreds of years and advancements later, not a single person has also found out the secret??? Maybe this would make more sense if we actually saw how he made the thing, but all we get is him writing out these long equations. Sheesh. Anyway, after spending about four minutes in this futuristic city, science boy travels ahead a few more years. Now the moon is breaking into pieces. Got that? Good, because we must move on at an unnecessarily lightning quick pace in this 90 minute blur. Now we are 800,000 years in the future, where the peaceful Eloi are being hunted by very dull puppet creatures. From here on in TTM is too much like the new Planet of the Apes, another movie that bored me. Another thing to note is that, again, 800,000 years from our hero's starting point, English is still around thanks to collected stones. Yeah, sorry, but I doubt those would have lasted for very long. There's about fifty more continuity problems in here, I'm sure, but it would take way too long to list them. Let's just say that The Time Machine is not worth anyone's time. How could it have been better? Let me suggest:Act One: We get to see the scientist actually MAKE the machine from scratch, with trial and error ensuing. And do we really need the love story to motivate him??? Why not just invent for the sake of invention?Act Two: First successful trial of the machine, and we are in the near future. Here time travel could at least be acknowledged as a theory, and the scientist could show off his machine. Something could go wrong, and he goes 800,000 years into the future.Act Three: The Eloi and Morlocks escapade. Again, no sappy love story with one of the pretty pretty Eloi. It's just too extraneous. Scientist could help the Eloi battle the Morlocks (since in the actual movie they seem pretty advanced and the mucky bad guys are like apes). In the end, scientist decides to stay. Or something. I'm not a film maker. However, the people who created this blob of blah are. Shame on them! I give TTM 1 out of 4 stars.P.S. It looks like the time machine just sits in the same place while the surroundings change...so why didn't anyone notice the thing??!! This is probably the biggest problem I have with this movie.However, these guys are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. No matter what the critics say, they liked it, too. Heck, it's their business to find fault, and yes, this movie did leave a fair ration of fault to find, if that was your inclination. The movie was fun, imaginative and visually gratifying. Yes, there were some inaccuracies and even some logic problems with the given premise, but to me that just gives rise to more discussion and actually asks more of the audience than if it painstakingly made a point to make no error.It should be noted that this could easily make the action/adventure section as well as the science fiction. It had a lot of Indiana Jones in it. Basically, go into the movie for a good time, and you will have it. Go into it hoping to find fault, well, you will have that too. You'll enjoy it either way, just in very different ways.PARENTS: If you have small children, especially those prone to nightmares, this is not the movie for them. The future Morlocks are very scary, and there are many surprise shocks and scares, dizzying heights, and chase scenes that actually remind one of a nightmare. I wouldn't bring anyone under 10. Yes, there are kids younger who would be fine, but I wouldn't risk it until you've seen it first...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this movie on its premier here in Norway, rather poor turn up, but the film didn't let us down too much.The film is based H.G. Wells famous novel and the story is quite familiar. Scientist invents time machine; scientist goes into the future, far into the future and discovers some disturbing truths. The scientist encounters the Elois and later the Morlocks and so on.The film doesn't follow the book very tightly, but the main idea is still there. To not bother you with too much detail, I thought the cast did pretty well. Guy Pearce stars as the scientist, Samantha Mumba the sweet Eloi female he encounters and Jeremy Irons (overplays, again) as the main bad guy. Note however that Orlando Jones does a marvellous roll as the computer Vox #NY-114, somewhat of a comic relief in the movie.The effects are rather good, especially the time travelling sequences. The time machine itself seems pretty convincing as a machine that real can travel through time. The film is rather short, something it suffers from at the end. As the first half hour or so in the start is rather amusing, the ending is rather quick and snappy. I would give it a seven out of ten, If you like sci-fi you ought to watch this film.</fullReview>

Science fiction fans will have a difficulty finding time to rent it, and if they do they will probably find it frustrating. Waiting for somebody to do a critique of the chalkboard scribblings.

		<shortDescription>A very remarkable remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went into the theater, I was prepared to see an updated version of George Pal's version. Instead, the movie started off with a reason to travel through time rather than an explanation of the fourth dimension. As the first trip for Alexander, the "multiple matter-single time" theory is yet to be explained and isn't explained in the whole movie. When Alexander learns that destiny cannot be changed, he travels to another time to have a question answered: "Why can't one change the past?". An interactive supercomputer with an encyclopedia for an artificial mind enters the picture. Dr. Hartdegen's question is still not answered, so he travels again. This time, he learns of a turning point in history, just like Pal's World War III. Like George Wells in the 1960 version, Alexander Hartdegen rushes to the distant future in fear and in hopes to see the outcome. When the machine is stopped, Hartdegen first learns about the Eloi and creates a personal relationship with one, Mara. Like in the '60 version, later on, Alexander learns of the Morlocks and Mara is taken. He tempts to rescue her and gets his question answered by the head Morlock. During a brutal fight, Dr. Hartdegen travels even further into the future and finds a horrible world. To try to change it, he returns to the Eloi/Morlock world and create a new life for the Eloi. There's a slight difference in the endings that cannot be revealed here, but in both Pal's and Wells' versions, George and Alexander have learned to accept the fact that you can only change the future by learning from the past and begin to teach the Eloi of the past to prepare for the future.Overall, I'd give this movie an A- due to lack of originality of H. G. Wells' novel, but incredible creativity and visual effects.

		<fullReview>After watching The Time Machine, I was disappointed that the film lasted for only about 90 minutes, which was not enough. The visual effects were very impressive, especially the two time-travelling scenes (1899 to 2030 and 2037 to 800 000 years later). This film lacks explanation (Did this time machine get its power by solar energy, or something else?), but the whole film seems okay to me, I rate it 7/10. For those special visual effects lovers, I recommend you to buy this movie (when available, but do not buy pirated products) and add it to your home entertainment collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time is not on your side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine`The Time Machine' is all about special effects. Some of them are pretty good. Others not so much. It's also a retread of `Planet of the Apes' - an inauspicious sign for any film. On top of all this, it's got the look and feel of a project that's been rotting in the pipeline for a while, and is about as good as you would expect your own great-grandson's interpretation of your work to be. The first half of the film is more or less a prologue. When Professor Alexander Hartdegan's (Guy Pearce) fiancée is killed by a mugger, he devotes himself entirely, by which I mean he stops shaving, to perfecting his time travel device in hopes of going back to save her. After filling several chalkboards with algorithmic scrawls, he is able to travel back to the night she was killed. Alas, things don't work out as planned, and he's left torturously wondering why he can't change the past. Perhaps the future holds the answer? Of course, this doesn't work out all that well for our hero either. He gets a bit of information from a helpful (and very hip) library index - in the form of a pixilated Orlando Jones - in a futuristic New York Public Library, but the question keeps nagging him. Fortunately for the good professor, a chaotic series of events leaves him unconscious in his still-operating time machine, transporting him 800,000 years into the future. Hartdegan wakes up in the care of the Eloi, a tribe of bald future New Yorkers who conveniently have living among them a gorgeous woman who also speaks the `old language,' namely Hartdegan's English. We find out that somewhere along the way a natural catastrophe created an evolutionary fork in the road. The peace-loving Eloi are now hunted by the Morlocks, a bunch of nasty simians who occasionally pop out of the ground to drag away the unfortunate simpletons. Most of this is explained, in one of the film's many speeches, by the leader of the Morlocks, a pale Jeremy Irons with a brain so evolved it now runs the length of his spine on the outside of his body like a biological mullet cut. By this time, however, we've forgotten what Hartdegan was after in the first place, leaving Irons' plot explication even less interesting and relevant than it would have been otherwise. The film's editing is choppy, occasionally incoherent, and consistently distracting. Director Simon Wells spends so long setting up his premise (or rather, his great-grandfather H.G.'s premise) that he leaves himself insufficient screen time to explore it. The last half-hour or so gives the impression that Wells is just bursting to blow his CGI load all over the audience, which he does in an orgiastic blast of lighting that not only takes care of the monsters, but of our last shred of interest in his film, as well. `The Time Machine' manages to suck nearly all traces of social commentary that seem to have driven the original story (I haven't actually read it), although the potential here for such is great. Taken out of the context of parable, it's exposed for the rather silly exercise it is, exacerbated by Wells' attempts to force an action-adventure interpretation upon it. If time is what you've got, figure out something else to do with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody realized, until early in production that this movie was being directed by the grandson of H.G. Wells. To their tribute, the film was very well done. Little bits of the original film were present and excellent modern renditions also played a part in the remaking of this classic. Rarely do you find that remakes are better than the original, but this one did an enviable job. I rarely listen to the critics, as they have to feed their own egos as well as find some sort of tripe to print in their articles, to get noticed or talked about. This film was panned by many. No...it was certainly not a masterpiece of film making. But it was a wonderfully entertaining piece of science fiction, without a lot of blood and guts, killing, vaporizing, etc. Go see this film and be prepared for a most enjoyable visit into the fantasy that is H. G. Wells.</fullReview>

The critics also gave Count of Monte Cristo a bad rating, but i also enjoyed that. (and they gave Gosford Park, a movie which was BO-RING but had an voyeuristic type approach to giving the audience a view of "the basement" and the "main floor" people, but in essence was a very boring movie. It's funny, the time machine also deals with above the ground and below the ground people.

		<fullReview>Loving the book and George Pal film, I knew winning me over would be quite a challenge for this movie, but what can a man do? So I went, and was driven nearly insane by the mix of things done "right" and things seemingly horribly wrong. I sincerely hope the assumption that this generation cannot grasp curiousity as motive for time travel is wrong. Other reviewers have found Pearce's characters motivation a hollow shell of the more noble Taylor version, and I tend to agree. There was no need to add a selfish motive for the construction of the machine. I saw absolutely no reason for these Eloi to be victimized by the Morlocks here. They had fire, were capable of feeding and clothing themselves, and exhibited the full range of emotions and skills necessary to organize a revolt or defend themselves. Maybe I'm overanalyzing, but I don't think so. The effects, on the other hand, were perfect. I felt chills seeing the Earth's morphing surface beneath the tiny safe bubble of the machine. The morlocks were acceptable once your CGI blinders were on. Uber-morlock? Now thats just silly..... I doubt there will ever be a version of this movie faithfully adapted from the book, as apparently social commentary isn't practiced in film anymore. I still have hope there will be a true version of War of the Worlds, but once again I have that weird hope/fear reaction. Only Time will tell....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Time Machine" is an interesting movie. Although I can't be sure how close to the original story by H.G. Wells it is. The story follows Guy Pearce as Prof. Alexander Hartdegen, who comes off at first as an "absent-minded professor," easily carried away by the idea of technology. When his fiancée is killed, he tries in vain to prevent her death by going back in time. Failing to change the past, he goes to the future to seek answers. The story does leave a little to be desired. It never shows Prof. Hartdegen building his time machine, or explains just how it works. The most interesting thing about the movie are the special effects. Here, the visuals are used well in representing the passage of time. First, in the changing of seasons quickly, then in styles of fashion and architecture, and ultimately, in geological changes. The visuals catch the eye, but can't quite save the script.</fullReview>

Some of the changes work but in the end some do not. Some very good effects and the Morlocks were impressive but it looked like they left half the film on the cutting room floor. Too little time is spent in the futuristic setting which itself resembles a Cancun Resort.

		<fullReview>The Time Machine is an example of a movie with far too much anticipation and far too many comparisons. Taken in and of itself, it is a very enjoyable movie. It moves along quickly and logically, and does not get bogged down on itself. I rented the old version for my kids and they enjoyed it for its concepts. Which is what that version is all about and why it lingered on the idea of time travel...an idea that was considered newer in the early sixties when the baby boomers were learning about it. Then we saw the new version and they were captivated. It moved along quicker, the special effects, especially the Morlocks, were very realistic, and the `moving through time' concepts were really brought into focus, especially with the change in topography of the earth.Today, the audience is more sophisticated and there is less need to explain and dwell on time travel in and of itself. The new version of the Time Machine can focus on other concepts, like the intelligence of the Morlocks, and the social development of the Elois. The producers of The Time Machine never promised to create a movie that was exactly like the book or the original movie and that is a good thing. I thought this movie was an improvement of the 1960 version and I am sure that the producers of that version, if they had a chance, would have made their movie better in 1965 or 1970 etc. Shakespeare used stories and ideas from earlier authors and if playgoers were like today's moviegoers, they would have shunned his works for not being like the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I have never read the original HG Wells book, I saw this movie last night and I was quite disappointed. My movie partner, who has read the original novel, told me the movie took the idea from the book but went off on its own tagent. He was also unhappy with the movie.Prof. Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) decides to travel to the future after his girlfriend Emma is killed in a mugging, and he finds he cannot go to the past to save her. She's obviously destined to die. After an accident he finds himself 800,000 years in the future. The world has changed by leaps and bounds, and his "new home" is just like something out of the cave man era. Few humaniods speak English, but he does find one: Mara (played by pop singer Samantha Mumba). Mara and her people are fighting against a race of monkey-like people that live in the subworld. After Mara is kidnapped by one, Alex decides to go and rescue her. He encounters the leader of this dangerous killer race, and he shows him the life he could have had with Emma. Alex decides against leaving Emma's people to fend for himself, and he evetually destroys the monkey race. He stays on in the future after his time machine is destroyed, a newly happy man who has put the past and the memories of his dead girlfriend behind him.First, the movie is too extreme. It switches elements too often. Alex is trying to find the answer to his question: "What if?". Why can't he change the past? Then he ends up in the future and suddenly he has to save this primitive village from tall, blue monkeys. It just didn't make sense.Samantha Mumba has something that Britney Spears and Mandy Moore don't seem to have: genuine acting talent. I did enjoy her performance as Mara.</fullReview>

I got fooled like I usually do. I once bought the ronco pocket fisherman and I think I got a way better deal then.First off, how did that nerdy professor score such a hot babe? Come on now, she is way out of his class. She's in the major leagues and he's still playing tee ball. His hair looked all greasy and stinky. Think about it, when they went on their date, he didn't even shower before meeting her. He didn't even brush his teeth! He just changed his jacket! And there she was, in her red dress of doom with her curves bumpin' and lips as soft as a cow liver. Mmmmmm. Cow liver. To top it all off, he's late because he was working in his lab...what a dufus.Besides the obvious flaws, the story was dumb. I don't want to give away the story for those that haven't seen it yet, but first he was on a noble mission, then suddenly he's fighting monsters. WTF? Hello? Hello? Anyone home? Earth to director, a movie usually tries to make sense. To put it bluntly, the movie was part Twilight Zone and part Lord of the Rings. No kidding.Finally, the time machine itself. How does it work? He just magically made it? HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW?!!? Looks like a big massage chair with neon lights. I mean, come on, at least give us a hint on how the time machine was made so that I can go down to Home Depot and make my own. Then I can go back in time to when I was a kid and my tooth came out and I put it under my pillow for the tooth fairy. I would pretend to sleep and when my dad came in to put some spare change under my pillow, I can confront him and demand his motivation for making me think there was fairies giving me money.If you like senseless, meaningless, meandering mish mash, then by all means, see the Time Machine, it won't dissapoint. However, if you like movies with substance, style, oscar potential, see Glitter with Mariah Carey.</fullReview>

It is not a blockbuster, but if you like science fiction go see it or even better get the copy when it comes out for rental you will enjoy if you are a science fiction buff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Time Machine is one of those wonderful films that has something to say and doesn't hit you over the head with its point of view. It unfolds like a flower just like the time machine itself. Beside the goosebumps you get when the machine travels for the first time and all the SPECIAL effects, Guy Pearce as the time traveller, allows you to discover and feel the changes in his worlds and put you right there.The Eloi's unquestioning of their way of life - not facing their fears with no dreams for the future - were sheep (poignantly noted by Vox - the compendium of all human knowledge) as much as the `bowler hats' of Alexander's day. The passions and intelligence of the time traveller led us on an up and down journey (literally &amp; figuratively). It's worth the trip. So much is packed into every scene that seeing it once was just not enough. I loved this film. Will become a classic !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marginal recommendation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a ify at best recommendation for me. I did like the set-up to creating the time machine. It was a bit slow but showed a very human side, caring drama, grief and compulsion. Unfortunately once it goes in high gear to the future while Guy Pearce handles the script the CGI animation takes over.... badly! The Morlocks look like animated half werewolf half human. Add to it that in pivotal final escape everything is so dark you can't see and it's so jumbled it is difficult to watch. A plus for explanation of the time paradox and for comedic touches by Orlando Jones as a photon librarian hologram. So if you can get past what I found to be fake looking animation then the story at least for me holds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My boyfriend and I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for months. He had seen the original and told me about it and when I saw the trailer for this one (and not to mention Guy Pierce whom we BOTH love and have alot of respect for) I really, really wanted to see it.Unfortunately, though, it was nothing like I imagined it would be. Even, my four-year-old thought it was "dumb". Nothing is delved into. We're not told much of anything. It seemed to both my boyfriend and me that there was a lot chopped out of this movie.

		<shortDescription>Surprised by the reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I am very surprised that this movie is geting eaten alive by reviewers. I'm not so surprised by the imdb bad reviews, but that's another story. This version of the Time Machine was excellent. I liked how it kept closer to the book than the original movie. More importantly, I felt that it was simply a cool protrayal of the idea of time travel. I like all sci-fi, even bad sci-fi, but I felt this movie was a 9.Don't take this rating as an indication that I like all remakes. I felt that the new Planet of the Apes movie was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.The new Time Machine movie explores some of the age-old time travel dillemas, it has suspense, romance, drama, cool sci-fi, great special effects, horror (?) and isn't overly long (96 minutes). If you like time travel or science fiction movies, this is a must see in the theatre as opposed to vhs or dvd. Just look past the bad reviews from posts on this site and go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERSThis movie was interesting, but it had one problem: It was too short. It ended right when it really was getting good. But if that's how the book went, then so be it. The time-lapse effects and exploding-moon stuff was cool, but there wasn't enough of the latter. But if that's how the book went, then so be it. I won't spoil the ending, but it's not emotional or complex or LONG enough. But if that's how the book went, then so be it.Industrial Light and Magic did some really cool visual effects on this film - watching 800,000 years pass by in 30 seconds is really fascinating - the thing where the vines over the arbor UN-GROW themselves is really strange to watch.Morlocks are said to be descendants of humans. Well, they look nothing really like us. If there really is the DNA in human beings to creat such animals, please, God, let my family be an exception. We ain't no cannibal apes here.This movie seems EXACTLY like a Tim Burton film. In fact, the latter half reminded me instantly of last year's PLANET OF THE APES. Also, Guy Pears looks uncannily like Johnny Depp in this movie (whom Tim Burton cast in almost every one of his films).Anyway....on with the interesting stuff. This guy invents a time machine. He travels into the mid-21st century, where he goes into a museum and there's this holographic dude with all the information of the Internet at his command. A construction project on the moon has gone horribly wrong and broken it in half. He then goes back into the time machine, but gets knocked unconscious while the time machine progresses for 800,000 years.800,000 years in the future, people live in these hammock-like scallop structures plastered onto the side of a canyon carved out by the Hudson River, surrounded by jungle which now occupies the area of land formerly known as New York City. The people have gathered the last remains of New York into the walls of a small pit which serves as a teaching center.P.S. Gore Verbinski directed part of this, and he only gets credit in Special Thanks? Simon Wells must be a snob.MY RATING: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, I don't go out of my way to see remakes but I figured the Time Machine promised some really great special effects.Since it is a Warner Bros./Dreamworks picture I didn't think I would be disappointed. Boy, was I wrong.Where were the special effects??? A couple of vines growing on the glass? Blah! Extremely disappointing! It got a little better when he goes to the far future I at least thought to myself what a pleasant screensaver that would make.And just who thought up this weak storyline? In the original movie there were many little time vignettes, he went back, he went further back, he went forward, forward, etc... In this version I felt completely ripped off. One half-baked story that was more from a Ray Bradbury story I remember reading about the night and day people than the H.G. Wells story I paid to see.Sure, it doesn't take a genius to figure out you can't go back and change the past to save you're beloved but wouldn't you at least try more than once? If all the scientists in the world gave up after only trying something once instead of trying to change the circumstances then we'd be as pathetic a race as the ones in this story.I had read some review on IMDB before going to see the film that had said Jeremy Irons only had one scene but that it was great. Dressed up as a drag queen/ marilyn manson look alike in an old Billy Idol outfit with some fins is not my idea of a great scene. The special effects when he dies were probably the most exciting of the movie.I normally pride myself on being one of those people who "gets it" even when most people are still sitting around saying "I don't get it" well today I Don't Get IT! What was the point? What was the answer to the question? How did blowing up the Time Machine in that one location fix everything when Irons had already said there were many pockets of his kind (didn't he?). What was his connection to Irons? I got the feeling there was some great revelation they were unraveling there but I just didn't get it. OK and The futuristic folk living on the cliffs... WHY? Sure it looked pretty but why...The movie showed some promise when Pearce first arrives in the future, the moon colonies, and the only worthwhile save for the picture (if there can be one)... The Photonic Librarian.All I got from this film was "If you're safe on the cliffs, stay there... and don't be a moron and go into the fields." : </fullReview>

A few things I'd like to point out...Jeremy Irons is the "bad guy" but you can say that he "guest stars" in the movie. Why are the defenseless people that live above the ground all colored? Then a white man comes along and tells them what to do? Don't even get me started on the pale-white (literally) leader of the underground, aggressive Morlocks.

Also, what's the deal with that black babe? As if people would look like her in 808K years. And the evil Jeremy Irons was like Darth Maul.

		<fullReview>There's no accounting for taste. The majority of people out there don't seem to like Simon Wells' The Time Machine. I, for one, enjoyed it very much. And I am a sci-fi aficionado.Let's face it...the time travel film hasn't been made yet that can stand logical scrutiny. So, to enjoy this film you simply need to cut it some slack...stop being so anal.The special effects are spectacular. When the time machine moves through hundreds of thousands of years of geologic epochs, the changing scenery astounded and delighted me. The special effect of the time machine itself, as a spinning sphere of light, was just way too cool.Guy Pearce gave a solid performance; not his best work to date, but certainly acceptable. And Jeremy Irons was truly memorable; his stark albino appearance was creepy and haunting.This film is not strong on characterization, but few sci-fi films are. The story is good enough to carry the movie, despite the negative comments here. The Time Machine is largely a special effects vehicle and in this respect it holds it own with The Matrix, X-Men, Starship Troopers, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan, Star Wars, etc. This is fine company, indeed!The Morlock beasts were *fabulous*, far better than the shaggy humanoids with glowing eyes in the 1960 film version. Rarely in movies do 'monsters' give me a scare, but these Morlocks *actually* gave me the willies!Simon Wells may have taken some liberties with his great-grandfather's original story, but I have no problem with the changes. The film works and that's all that needs to be said.And I didn't feel the ending was particularly rushed.Okay, The Time Machine is not a *great* film, but it is nonetheless an enjoyable movie experience. I liked it enough that I will definitely buy the DVD when it comes out. I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

My first question is did anybody in the movie bother to read the book? I doubt it. My guess is that everyone read the back of the cliff notes and decided to try to wing the rest. the movie is totally unbelievable from beginning to end with nothing but mistakes and inconsistancies in between. I can accept a few creative liberties here and there (such as Orlando Jones' character and a few of the attempted jokes) but there is a limit. without discussing the plot (or what barely passes as one) in order to not give anything away, I'll simply say to anyone that hasn't seen this movie "Don't bother" and to anybody who has seen it, I extend my sincerest condolences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basic, yet worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine was pretty basic in what it was trying to achieve. I saw it as the beginning for the upcoming summer action flicks. There were some problems in this movie that could have been fixed. Guy Pierces erratic acting to portray an absent minded professor was a little over the top for me. I felt the event for him to built the time machine happened a little too soon in the movie. The effects that describe what happens when one goes through time were very good though but i wanted more out of the movie than effects. I guess the first plot point of the movie is when he bumps his head and travels to the future to meet the Eloi. I felt this happened too fast in the movie,the director or screenwriter should have taken their time in getting Guy Pierce from one end of time to the other, although could make for a boring movie but the development of the adventure would have been better (only an opinion). The Morlocks looked good and I liked Jeremy Irons bit part in the film. I have to see it again to have some things explained to me about the creation of the Eloi and tha Morlocks. I have only seen a small scene from the 1960 film so i guess i have to look at that one and compare the two. All in all the Time Machine prepared me for the summer blockbusters (my favorite time of year)so in the end i guess it did it's job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but Definitely Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that this movie has its flaws: it doesn't explain time travel, it seems to transition too quickly to adventure mode in the middle, and the characters are not well developed. Well, at least in the first case, we already have ideas of how time travel works from millions of other movies, so I don't think a rehash was necessary. I liked the introduction of the idea that Alex invents time travel for the sole reason of correcting something in the past. I thought this brought a nice link to the story, because it reflects how we would like to change our past or what we have done. We know that we can't change what happened, and even though Alex can time travel, he still can't change it. I thought this drew a nice parallel, especially when he was frustrated when he learned that time travel did nothing to improve his situation. So then he travels into the future and ends up learning that he can change the future. Likewise, we have the power to learn from our past and mold our future.The special effects of time travel were visually stunning, one of the best parts of the movie. The time lapse of different ages, the fast forward of construction, destruction, and terrain evolution were all incredible. The music was also motivating and nicely coupled the particular eras.Overall, I know this movie has flaws, but so did the original book! For example, the original Time Traveller built a micro model of a time machine for the sole purpose of a small demonstration... which works only once and he doesn't know when it will pop out of its travel. This is like making a mini Enterprise that can warp around the universe in the 20th century without means of mass production and scaled down architecture - it is engineeringly unfeasible and unimaginable. So I would give this film some space in what it considers science and enjoy it for its pure entertainment factor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie last Sunday, I am left a few things to say. First of all, I haven't seen the original or read the book, so I can't make any significant distinguishes between the three. What I can say is that I enjoyed the movie extremely. The acting was very well done, and the plot did not depend on the reliability of the computer animation. And, as I'm sure everyone would like, it would be neat to see what our world looked like in 800,000 years. Guy Pearce is a remarkable actor with great flare and attitude. Samantha Mumba gave the movie a distinct magnetism, and I have to say there is literally no scene in which you'll be bored, because all the non-active scenes are compelling, and relatively brief. Overall, a neat film with great actors.</fullReview>

Also, if the movie had been even 10 minutes longer and they had developed the relationships between the main characters a bit more, it would have made the ending mean something. As it was, I didn't have enough invested in them emotionally to be happy or sad at how things turned out. Bottom line: Wait for it to come out on video/DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wrinkle in "Time"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something I've always found more interesting than the concept of time travel is the means by which movie heroes achieve it. Since the 80s, filmmakers always seem to turn the most mundane objects into souped up science fictional wonders. Michael J. Fox had his DeLorean, Bill and Ted had their phone booth, and now Guy Pearce has his chair. `The Time Machine' is the big screen adaption of the classic H.G. Wells novel of the same name, and you heard me right, the `Memento' star journeys through the ages without ever having to get off his rear. Don't get me wrong though, it's a really cool chair--one of many amazing special effects created by those CGI wizards at DreamWorks. Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegan, a twitchy scientist/inventor who builds a time machine after his fiancée is killed. He travels to the past in an attempt to save her life, but when he's unable to do so, Alexander decides to try out the future instead. The time travel sequences that follow are without a doubt the highlight of this film. The special effects are breathtaking and extremely creative. As Alexander travels centuries into the future, his machine keeps him in an unaffected bubble as he watches the world around him rapidly move forward. He witness's seasons come and go, buildings rise and fall, small rivers become massive canyons, all from the safety of his comfy super-chair. Unfortunately, as the movie peaks at the visual level, the actual story quickly plummets. The plot splinters and seems to begin a completely different movie. Alexander finds himself 800,000 years in the future. The human race has evolved into two different species: the simple, peaceful, cliffside-dwelling Eloi, and the hideous, brutal, Eloi-eating Morlocks. Alexander becomes engulfed in the battle waging between the two species and ends up joining the fight. `The Time Machine' is definitely entertaining if you don't take it too seriously. It is not intended to move or inspire the audience. It's a popcorn movie, plain and simple. The film is directed by Simon Wells, whose previous work consists solely of animated features like `Fievel Goes West' (he also happens to be the great-grandson of H.G. Wells). He keeps the pace of the film quick and exciting, despite the somewhat lazy script he's following. In his first live-action effort, Wells is also able to generate a solid performance from the always reliable Pearce as well as exceptional supporting cameos by Jeremy Irons and Orlando Jones. The special effects are top notch, and as far as sci-fi adventure films go, this one will definitely keep your attention. But `The Time Machine' ultimately feels like two movies rolled into one. During the first half of the film we see Alexander frolicking with the love of his life, and the obsessive madness that overcomes him after she is killed. Then suddenly he's thrown into the future and becomes the gung-ho protector of an entire civilization. During the later half, there's barely any mention of the deceased fiancée or his quest to bring her back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What If?........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The key question asked of Guy Pearce by Uber-Morlock Jeremy Irons in the latest remake of H.G. Wells' classic "Time Machine" is "What if?"... and I wound up asking the same thing after seeing this near miss. What if the very likable Rod Taylor of the 1960 George Pal classic version could have time-traveled into the 2002 production and replaced the dour, brooding Guy Pearce? What if the fetching Yvette Mimieux were able to encore her Eloi fair maiden? What if the new Morlocks had more of the scary design of the original subterranean monsters and less of a "Neverending Story" look (remember the giant turtle)? I loved the new model time machine. And the fast-forward special effects as the hero flies into the future. But as the credits rolled I felt the casting could have been better, the script could have been tighter, and the make-up effects could have been more inspired. A timeless story and some wonderful special effects, however, saved the film. For these reasons, I give "The Time Machine" (2002) a reserved thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a subject for fiction, time travel may never lose its appeal. People have always been fascinated with the ideas and implications of men traveling into the past or forward to the future, meeting their own great-grandchildren, changing the course of history. Unless (or until) mankind ever achieves this task, this fascination will continue infinitely...much as time itself sometimes seems to. The latest cinematic iteration of this undying subject is Simon Wells' "The Time Machine", an adaptation of perhaps the most venerated of all time travel tales, written by the director's grandfather, H.G. Wells, in 1896. It's a sturdy and handsomely mounted production that nevertheless encounters its share of narrative bumps and lapses. In this world, man can escape the bounds of time, but he can't undo the shackles of sloppy screenwriting.Wells' nameless Time Traveler is here christened Alexander Hartdegan (Guy Pearce). He is a turn-of-the-19th-century science professor at Columbia University, desperate to figure out how to change the past after a terrible accident of fate robs him of his lady love. A student of the radical new theories of Einstein and a believer that order was made to be violated, Hartdegan locks himself in his lab and creates the ultimate scientific innovation, a whirling mishmash of brass dials and metal fans that enables one to move through time. Through a series of accidents, Hartdegan is transported not into the past, but 800,000 years into the future, where mankind has evolved into two conflicting races. The Eloi are a peace-loving, idyllic race of simple tribal people. The Morlocks are hideous subterranean killing machines who see the Eloi as...well, I'll leave it at that. Hartdegan realizes the Eloi's horrible fate, and decides that even though he can't change the past, it might not be too late to change the future.It is to the credit of Wells and screenwriter John Logan that the film does not get excessively bogged down in time-travel paradoxes. We're not sitting there the whole time wondering "Well, if he had really been there, then wouldn't this have...?" You know, all the standard questions you ask yourself when a time-travel tale's really not working. Instead, they are able to pull a surprising amount of emotional interest out of the plight of a man, unmoored from the one thing that allowed him to understand life, adrift in time, looking for a place where he can make a difference, where he will finally make sense. The picture also has a lot going for it from a technical standpoint. There are plenty of memorable images supplied by cinematographer Donald McAlpine ("Moulin Rouge"), and Oliver Scholl's production design is often a funky mix of future retro and Industrial Age gear-shaft chic. Wells' f/x crew provide several dynamite sequences of Hartdegan's time machine surrounding by the whirling changes of the ages (the rapidly hollowing out rock shapes were my favorite), and though the Morlocks do look a bit more rubbery around the face than they should, the sequence where they attack the Eloi village is relentlessly kinetic and genuinely frightening.Ultimately, however, even the Morlocks are powerless against third-act problems, and "The Time Machine" is full of them. Jeremy Irons appears as the leader of the Morlocks, who somehow has kept his normal face while the others have evolved into nasty looking pig-rat-faced things. The narrative makes it extremely unclear who exactly he is supposed to be. An evolved form of Morlock? Another time traveler? The unholy evolution of Hartdegan himself? It's never even really delved into by the story, and when the whole shebang is "resolved" with a fistfight between Hartdegan and the Morlock king on the whirling, glowing time machine...finally, the questions start. It's not time-travel paradoxes that trip up "The Time Machine". It's plain old sloppy writing, the willingness to throw logic to the winds just so the filmmakers can make sure that something explodes in the last reel.The actors do their best with the material. Pearce always seems like a real man and not a buff action hero, though he doesn't display nearly as much life or wit as he did as the sneering villain of "The Count of Monte Cristo". Sienna Guillory, as Hartdegan's 19th-century love, is so charming and pretty that I'd like to see more of her in something where she has more to do. Samantha Mumba, Hartdegan's future partner in action, is also a knockout, but her role doesn't give her much to do besides look pretty and model billowy white pants. Irons is basically wasted, stranded by his ill-conceived character and reduced to the growling "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" theatrics that have become his recent stock in trade. Oddly, the two most moving characters are two who virtually drop out of the last half of the picture, Hartdegan's friend and housekeeper, played with subtle warmth by Mark Addy and Phyllidia Law. It is they who, in many ways, carry the buried message of "The Time Machine". Hartdegan, after all, is able to escape the coming of change by fleeing far beyond the scope of his own life. Addy and Law's characters, however, will remain, to remember Hartdegan and try to enact his change-the-world lesson in their own humble way, a notion cemented by Addy's final, unexpectedly heroic gesture.Still, maybe I'm getting a little too deep about a few supporting characters in a popcorn movie. "The Time Machine" is like that, though. It's a film you can almost feel straining to be deeper, more probing and profound than it actually is. Wells and Logan are to be commended for bringing the classic novel to the screen with reasonable fidelity (it's not note-for-note, but it's a lot closer than, say, Roland Joffe's "The Scarlet Letter"). Still, this is the cleaned-up happy-ending Hollywood version of classic literature. Over one hundred years after its initial publication, people are still returning to H.G. Wells' novel. I somewhat doubt we'll be able to say the same about Simon Wells' film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you examine commercial previews for The Time Machine, You'll find pretty much the whole movie compressed into short, 60 second ads. Theres no depth. Butt i wasn't anticipating any. I went to go see the cool pseudo-time lapse sequences and the fictional future, 800,000 years from now. And hey, it was pretty nifty when the moon got torn. Inevitably the movie suffers from some easily identifiable flaws. 1.)Its predictable nature.2.) The early dialogue sounds like something out of a bad off-broadway play. I know its supposed to be the turn of the century, butt come on! Folks back then weren't THAT hokey. Or were they? Perhaps well never know without our very own time machines.3.)The grunt-morlocks just plain sucked. And gosh were they ugly. I fail too see how 800,000 years of evolution can somehow mean de-evolution. They try to explain that they are the result of "careful breeding," butt I refuse to believe that any amount of "careful breeding" can result in dog-faced men. All the energy that went into character creation was apparently diverted towards the uber-morlock. Uber is right.4.) Finally, the score isn't all that great. I could do without the chantings of native people whome you don't see chant and the typical Thumpedy, dumpedy-dump at key action moments. This is just a minor quibble, as 99% of movie scores are par or sub-par. Still, I'd recommend that you go see The Time Machine on the great, big, wide screen. Despite its shortcomings, its worth seeing for the time lapse-photography, Uber-morlock, and because it clocks in waaaayyyyyy under 3 hours. ;) Just make sure you know what your getting into.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book prior to, but on the same day as I went to see the film. I'd been hearing bad reviews throughout the week, but regardless, found myself somewhat interested and looking forward to it for the most part.Obviously, I didn't expect it to be bad, but I also didn't expect it to be more than it was (a fun, sci-fi, adventure-drama) and therefore do not have a vat of disappointed expectations to overwhelm and beat you over the head with with. Terribly sorry about that (and the sarcasm ends here).In any case, I rue the fact that all those who seemingly worship the original H.G. Wells tale are forcing me to argue it's faults, but *seriously.* The book itself wasn't nearly as spectacular as everyone likes to make it out to be. I certainly give the man a whopping load of credit for his vision and creativity at the time, but come *on.*The novel wasn't really even a novel, it was more like a novelette. If you think 90 minutes is short, try 78 pages. Interesting, truly, but hello(!) character development, hello(!) relationships and warmth. I would've welcomed perhaps a little less emphasis on the parlor chat and a little more on what resulted from the `practical application' of all that was discussed. For crying out loud! I would've welcomed a few more actual character names. The beginning was intriguing, the middle seemed sterile and the end felt rushed. I appreciate the quality of inspiration he must have had to come up with such a concept, but the novel itself seemed more a vessel to exhibit said concept and less an actual story.Personally I find anything unjust (whether I'm personally affected or no) absolutely *beyond* frustrating, and so you can imagine how I felt after reading some of these painstakingly crafted, thoroughly undeserved and remarkably grandiloquent reviews.The film was pretty true to the original story and I found it's deviations and expansion quite surprising and welcome. Guy Pierce did well. I was pleasantly surprised with Samantha Mumba's efforts, and don't even get me started on Jeremy Irons. I'm serious. Just don't. *Sigh,* okay, just one word: Mesmerizing. The Morlocks were accurate and creepy as hell and I loved the seamless use of established and newer varieties of special effects. I've always found animatronics and make-up (when done well) far more impressive and effective than CGI, but I very much appreciated how the latter was utilized during the chase and time travel sequences.The story was good. The acting ranged from good to great. The special effects were impressive and Klaus Badelt did a lovely job with an, at times, quite moving score. In my view, the timing felt just right. So basically, I had a rockin' good time ;-) It's exciting, it's fun and, on the whole, quite impressively done. Yay movie!</fullReview>

Yet the same blue lipstick guy (see D&amp;D) well at least this movie isn't as painful to watch.The Eloi city was very well thought out, I did like the look of their city. But, it looked like an expensive set up for some Olympic game opening (don't ask), what was with the Lion King type music in the background. I was really expecting Tarzan to show up at some points, it was that wacky. This movie was all visual with no point, all icing no cream filling.Also the idea of time travel in this movie is VERY flawed, hence more of the reason to call this a B-Movie. Good if you check your mind at the door. And knowingly make fun of it. Wait for the cheap seats. And fun ripping it apart! A rather fun cheesy movie.......Rating: 5/10</fullReview>

Jeremy Irons' character wasn't evil enough to involve me in the movie. And let's talk about suspension of disbelief. Precious little ever turned up about the paradoxes inherent in time travel, and nothing at all ever came up to explain how spinning some chunks of fresnel lenses around an easy chair permits one to jump into the past or the future. And pray tell, how does a hologram machine survive 800,000 years of inactivity ... much less manage to teach 21st century English to illiterate primitives? I was sorely disappointed.

		<fullReview>"The Time Machine" filled with its use of imaginative visual effects isn't really a bad film nor is it a good film.It falls in the category of "I've seen better" films.Here is a film that suffers from one thing:the setup for the film.Guy Pearce plays scientist Alexander Hartdegen who proposes to his fiance who loses her life during a mugging.Alexander during the course of the film travels back to the same event with his time machine in hopes of saving her only to have her die under different circumstances.After watching the setup from this scene,I would have thought that he would of tried to use this tecnology to prevent what would have happen.But this is about a man who travels to the future so the setup from the beginning seemed innapropriate and added no sense to the film.When I left the theater,I thought to myself how a more different setup where the film explains more about Alexander's obsession with time travel rather than the events that happened to his fiance would have been more appropriate.When his fiance dies,why would he travel to the future to prevent her death when he would have gone to the past.Of course when he travels to the future,he has a whole new reason and his reasons of his fiance's murder is no longer.He has different reasons.I had a problem with this film not only because the setup was to far different but because some of the action scenes were poorly filmed with the cameras looking as if someone didn't know what they were doing.The visual effects were good and Guy Pearce was alright in the film but I just sat in the theater with a straight face and there was a never a time when the film amused or excited me.Some sections of the film were good but as for the rest of the film,it just seemed kind of boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A so-so film version of the great book that looks good, but just isn't very satisfying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This marks the first movie I've seen in a while that I have no strong feelings for either way. It's not good, but it's not bad either. Based on the great book by H.G. Wells, this "Cliff Notes" version (90 minute running time) is a CG-heavy film that doesn't fall into any category because it doesn't have a majority of time spent in any genre. There's a little bit of romance, a little bit of science fiction, and a little bit of adventure, but not enough of either to warrant a categorization.  Guy Pearce ("Memento") is OK as the lead character Alexander Hartdegen (though nameless in the book), but he can't really carry the movie. In fact, none of the characters are interesting or likeable enough to really care about too much. Orlando Jones and pop princess Samantha Mumba support, but also don't have a juicy enough role to work with. The only interesting character is Jeremy Irons as the humorously titled villain "Uber-Morlock". Unfortunately, he has less than 10 minutes of screen time, though. The real "star" in the movie is the in the special effects. There are some great sequences during the time travel scenes and the Morlocks look pretty good. Simon Wells (grandson of H.G.) directs, but seems to lose focus. It seems that he was more concerned with the look and feel of the movie rather than the story itself, which is the reason why he got the project. It's a shame that with such a great story that this couldn't have been a better movie. Obviously it came from a great story, so apart from the new effects, there was no reason to mess with the book or even the 1960 classic film version for that matter. This would be better to see in the theater if at all, but is only worth the price of a rental. Catch a matinee if you are still interested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely foreign to H.G. Well's 1989 classic! Dr. Hartdegen at Columbia University, New York, instead of Victorian England? Duh! Simon Wells should have stuck to his great grandfather's veiled Victorian cynicism about the theories of capitalism and communism? Okay, Simon has kept his great-granddaddy's vision of mankind's struggle to control their destiny! And there are some exciting GCI visual effects that may cause kids to squirm. But tidal waves and quakes. poor New York, victimized with more calamities, so shortly after 911?For H.G. Well's visional future, extending beyond 800,000 years, this film's Eloi population comes as a surprising bunch. Gosh, human beings back to the ages of Tarzan and raw Americana! And beings who have lost their English tongue... except for the chosen two! Credible? I fear not! And the nocturnal, predatory Morlocks (hurrah, Uber does speak English too!), appearing more annoying than menacing, could easily pass off as albino cousins of Pierre Boulle's apes! Of course, readers, familiar with the traditional tale, must be scratching their heads in disbelief! Can I accept Logan's version of futuristic life as two groups of beings, mushrooming from man's mistreatment of the moon and the ecosystems? Of course not!H.G. Well's fantasy, rooted from his fascination with Darwinism, Communism, and class-warfare of the Industrialized Age, has intrigued generations of readers. Are Logan and young Wells looking to market their work to a presumed non-thinking, pop generation? Feels like their desire is to adhere to contemporary American cognizance, rather than reproduce a Victorian man's troubling vision of his future! Surely, this is imitating George Pal - at worst! A total disaster. this film lacks mental energy and challenge; its characters and events are entirely deprived of soul and charisma! I'd be happier to see it as a cautioning political voice against environmental pollution. Change its title to something that equates `Black Holes,' perhaps, and I'd be more generous with my comments. Even if I were to accept John Logan's vision of his futuristic world, based upon earth's fate, it'll still be hard for me to swallow his notion of romance between the Time Traveler and Mara! Just a weak Hollywood attempt to sex up a classic for the hope of entertaining the MUMMY-esque fans, I gather!From the very beginning, the reasons, to support the Time Traveler's decision to build the time machine, are lame! What follows continues to fall short of credibility! And all the characters... flat and uninteresting! Besides, haven't we seen similar characters in other movies? Surely, Guy Pierce and Jeremy Iron - two fine actors with compelling performing talents - can't expect these to better their future acting career! Yep, dumping the character, Weena, for Mara and her precocious brother bothers me! These two don't even bring much hype to the plot! Casting out Weena's child-like character is plain suicidal... destroys H.G.'s imagery, so powerfully associated with the inner workings of that era's human psyche!Everything about this film appears awkward! This film has definitely robbed H.G.'s book of its symbolic beauty! With its abundance of whimsical flaws, it sends the viewers on a rough roller-coaster ride through a blotchy journey. Clearly, it's a rough mosaic deal, pasted with disjointed cuts and borrowed patches that fail to fit! This film is definitely pickled with abundance of fantastical hooplahs, and `Columbia University does not teach fantasy.' A lame conventional fantasized hogwash, wrapping around a 4000 pounds of metal-mold! A total disappointment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This review is in two parts. No real spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is in two parts. Since this movie is a remake of, in my opinion, a classic, it will be compared to the original. However, it should be reviewed on its own merits, as well.This movie stars Guy Pearce a professor named Alexander Hartdegen apparently living in 1899. He is somewhat excentric, but does have a friend named David Filby, played by Mark Addy. The interaction of Pearce and his home characters (he has a housekeeper named Mrs. Whatchit, played by Phyllidia Law) tries to give him personality but seems forced. He also has a girlfriend. When an incident changes his hope for the future with his girlfriend, Pearce becomes obsessed with changing the past.Unfortunately for Pearce's character, incidents force him to travel into the future. There he finds an Earth of 2030. His brief exploration of this time introduces him to a "holographic" interactive database named Vox (played by Orlando Jones). Not finding his answers, Pearce travels to the far future. Once there, he is found by what appear to be humans who now live on cliffs overlooking a river. As he finds more about these people's lives, he is exposed to a terrible fact. There is a predatory life-form that endangers these people.Unfortunately, this film has many problems. First, while boasting that it is directed by the grandson of H. G. Wells (the author of the original short story) there is very little of that story here. But, the biggest problem is Pearce. We never care about him, so we never care about his journey. The film tries to make him a maverick in the opening few minutes, but we don't believe it, or care what he has to say. His interaction with Filby and Watchit are too fleeting to really develop any sense of who these people are to him.Pearce's girlfriend, played by Sienna Guillory, is good, but their moments together seem out of place. And, the reason for time traveling is diminished, since we have no real sense of time (the director compresses four years of time) during the set-up.Once we get to the future, the "native" are not interesting, but they are supposed to be "mystical." And, there is the dreaded "cute kid," the ploy of desperation. Plus, the beasts that terrorize the "native" are typical to many "monsters" that show up in modern movies like "The Mummy."Now, when compared to George Pal's 1960 version, the brilliance of Pal's creativity shines. Where Pearce travels to the future because of a personal incident, the time traveler George (played by Rod Taylor) has a sense of exploration. We are excited by George's adventure. With the Pearce character, we are dragged along, hoping for an adventure. The natives in the new movie know too much, yet are unable to Pearce. Pal's version of the Eloi is of innocent and unaware children, but the new natives just don't work. We liked George, saw him have dinner with friends, and care about what he did. Pearce never gave us that in his character.Bottom line, avoid this version, see the original George Pal version, starring Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux, and Alan Young (who makes a cameo in the new movie).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The notion of time travel is so phenomenal and cinematic that it is sorry to see this film be ineffective. "The Time Machine" fails primarily because it lacks any signs of a coherent story. Even with the ultra-talented Guy Pearce in the lead role, the drama isn't quite dramatic enough, the action isn't quite adventuresome enough, and the special effects just aren't special enough. There are some fascinating shots and set design choices, and Jeremy Irons is fantastic in his all-too-brief villain role. In the end, this is one thrill ride that it's okay to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to enjoy this movie, and I mean really enjoy it, well, then I guess it's possible. You'll need to do a complete shutdown of any sort of logical process going on in your brain. You need to smile knowingly at the many "witty" one-liners. And finally, you need to embrace the random blue villain as an actual evil presence. The problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. Should we go for scifi, perhaps a little romance? Naw, lets just make an adventure. In this respect, the movie is a complete failure, because there are movies that do it a lot better (Back To The Future comes to mind presently). If graphics and mindless entertainment are your aim, then perhaps this movie is for you.At the advanced screening I went to, people were cheering and clapping in the end. I wanted to hit them.(******Major Spoilers Contained******) Logically of course, there is the Jeremy Irons pointless villain. There is the fact that people are speaking perfect English 800,000 years into the future. The stupid rubber monsters who live in caves and can come out into the light with no problem (I really like Iron's explanation as to why they live below ground...oh yeah, there is no explanation). Glass that supports the hologram incurs 800,000 years of damage in the form of a crack on one of the plates. People living on the sides of cliffs for protection when it provides no protection. Ok you get the point. Just don't think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four generations later, we have a revision of this classic science fiction film by none other that the great grandson of H. G. Wells. While entertaining and well presented, this film bears only a superficial resemblance to the original of 1960. Underlying the plot is the question of Fate. Why can't you change the past? The concept of Eloi and Moorlock are somewhat consistent with the original film and the novel, but their roles have significantly changed. The Eloi are fishers and farmers, and they live in cliff dwellings made of bamboo and other natural materials. The Moorlocks are still subterranean creatures, but now they are divided into castes, some bred for hunting, others bred to control. Where the hunters are physically superior, the controllers have mental powers which allow them to keep the hunters under control. Our protagonist is Alexander Hartdegen, not H. George Wells, and his motivation for creating the time machine is love, not commerce or scientific knowledge. The addition of Orlando Jones as Vox allows for the failure of Hartdegen to return to the past, since he contains all human knowledge from the 21st century and some beyond. Guy Pearce presents a believable character, and Samantha and Omero Mumba are excellent in their roles as the brother and sister Eloi who discover and befriend him. Mark Addy is Philby, and an excellent addition to the cast as Hartdegen's mentor and friend. Jeremy Irons portrays the Moorlock Leader with a rare and insightful talent that only he can generate. While his character is not evil in the sense we normally believe, he is still a thoughtful being who offers Hartdegen the opportunity to return to his own time. Rated PG-13 for violence, this film is highly entertaining but certainly not destined to be a classic. It is, however, an interesting revision of the original plot with some well thought out twists and turns, and the romantic angle of the film is sure to keep the ladies interested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many have tried to downgrade this movie but I guess they saw a different movie than I did. It's setting is in the US but so have many of the War of the World movies been located in the US. Adaptations are just that. They are going to be the vision of the book by the screenwriter and associates. They definitely don't want to make it an up-scaled version of the first one. I am old enough I saw both of these movies at the theater. Both are equally good. The second movie is by no means garbage in any way. It is a good movie in its own right and should not be compared to the other one or the book since it is not trying to recreate the first movie nor the book on the screen and is an entirely different medium. I had a hard time getting used to Guy Pearce because frankly I had never heard of him before this movie and he is a little odd looking. He played a much more eccentric professor and wasn't portrayed as H.G. as in the first movie. I like the way they dealt with his fiancé's death. It showed that no one was at fault that it would have happened one way or another.When something is fiction, it doesn't have to relate to science fact. It is a fairytale of sorts. It extrapolates on truths. I don't try to pick apart what could or could not happen scientifically and if anyone does that, it ruins the movie. I liked that Jeremy Irons was a surprise at the ending. It was very dramatic in the way they showed him and unsuspected. This movie had much more depth to it than the first one in my opinion but it takes a few watches to really get into it. The librarian gave the movie the comedy relief it needed and I thought was a good touch to the story.As for the special effects they were outstanding to me and as just an average person I didn't notice any goofs, etc. Most wouldn't notice those types of things. I thought it was stunning and the musical score is what hit me. It is absolutely fantastic. One of the best I had heard in a long time. It should have gotten much more recognition. It takes my breath away but maybe because I majored in music. Anyone who didn't like this movie was going into the theater with their own expectations rather than just sitting back and enjoying a very entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could H. G. Wells' own great-grandson destroy his ancestor's work so completely? This debacle betrays all thought and soul of the original story, and settles for loud noise and uninspiring visuals.The 60's version addressed the danger of a nuclear exchange, and the horrors of war in general. But what was this thing on about? The time traveler tries to change events in order to prevent a personal tragedy. He fails. Many times, thanks to cheap plot contrivances thwarting his efforts. The voyage to the future consists of lispy-voiced holograms, the moon cracking up (somebody explain to these film makers just what the ramifications of that are), mechanical goof-ups with the machine, and a cartoonish ghoul that looks like Willy Wonka minus his top hat. 800,000 years from now, he's using a fake British accent, and gadgets from modern day are still functioning. The overall look of the thing is just ugly, without artistic purpose. Then there's more stuff getting blown up, for no particular reason. Pointless and boring; goes nowhere.</fullReview>

Set design was a mash up of whatever came to mind, I guess. The machine itself was strange, which would not have been bad in itself, but the blender blades coupled with the brilliant laser like beams just exuded excess energy and would have drawn attention for miles. Gone is the wondrous symbolism of the control handle and crystal. Gone is the feeling of the inventor for the concept of time.His fiancée? Robbed, murdered? Really? This was an improvement? Adding a useless attempt at 'fixing' but failing history was painful. This was never the point of the story anyway.How many digits can the chronometer show? ##,###,###,###,###? Moon, did someone say Moon? This was deleted from the DVR without even watching the credits. To quote a young person I overheard, "I want my two hours back."Why 2 stars?

		<fullReview>There are a few malcontents who hate this movie, but it hard to see where they are coming from. This is a remake of a movie where a guy invents a time machine (how did you guess!) The original was a bit flawed and fragmented. This one tried to put together a lot of pieces. Rod Taylor usually played very unlikable characters, but he was likable as the inventor in the original. However, Pearce is perfectly cast as the inventor who travels through time. At first, he uses it for personal motives, and finds that no matter what he does, he cannot change the past. Whether or not we agree with this concept, the film goes about in a very clever way of showing its position on the matter. Of course, it is only a matter of time before our hero goes deep into the future. What he finds there is possibly a letdown for some movie fans, but given the premise of the movie, it is well done, except for the savage beasts that are just way too super, and look more like a geek's video game version of reality. But the director doesn't dwell much on their super powers, and it is easy to get past this flaw. Our hero is a very likable genius, and we travel along on the journey with him, the sign of a good movie, and good directing. In fact, the supporting cast is also very good. This movie has good atmosphere, and a pleasant feel. It is much better than the original, even given the expectations of the times, and the original was a good movie.</fullReview>

It is just like in medieval times where only high-class people could "understand" dramas and felt like they must not go to a comedy because it is for peasants... hypocrits... nothing changed.The Time Machine is a good movie.

Acting is so-so, although to be fair the actors don't have much of a chance because of the silly script. Well's critical novel is made into a cheap quasi Sci-Fi movie that is also stupidly patriotic. Of course the big good American guy can save those helpless little bush people of the bad bad guys and restore peace and order and all that on his own, of course. Yeah right. Jeremy Iron's appearance marks the most complex dialogue sequence of the movie (he is a bad bad guy that tells the good guy why everything happened that way) and his performance is probably the best of the movie next to the Hologram guy, whose second appearance is allowedly a clever plot twist. The only good direction takes place in the last scene of the movie when the future and the past are cleverly faded into each other. But don't waste your time or money on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a Scholastic Reading Club copy of "Time Machine" on my shelf so I guess I read it when I fell for my first Aussie actor, Rod Taylor, though I don't remember the book at all, but I've seen the old movie a lot of times. I was surprised this one was set in NYC, not London, especially as everyone's accents wandered around from American, to upper class American, to pseudo-Brit (at least it gets points for shooting in New York State -- upstate). The new time travel motivator as his dead fiancée worked well.The special effects during the time travel of the cities and climate changes were entertaining, and the art direction of the world of the future was creative, though, gee, some folks manage to still speak good English.Guy Pearce's hair got better looking as he went into the future. I'm sure the NY Public Library will be glad to know it survives, though its interior looks more like the Metropolitan Museum. Orlando Jones was surprisingly good as a cyber librarian.But ho hum on the battles with the underground enemy, even when led by Jeremy Irons. Sorry I had to laugh at him fighting with Pearce, even though Pearce is supposed to be a nerdy scientist and a chunky stunt double was doing the heavy lifting for Irons. With all of Irons's make-up, this was practically a voice-over and his "Scar" was scarier.And like all standard sci fi, damsels in distress in the future will be thin, beautiful and dress like Britney Spears (does that mean this is the future?), though this one is a teacher so has some brains too.Just not much of a thrilling ride on this machine.(originally written 3/17/2002)</fullReview>

They are replaced with a cheesy futuristic look at the 2030s, in which the moon breaks up. However, the impressive scene when the world whizzes from that to 800,000 years on seems to make up for it.One perhaps should not be overly critical of a film that has such a troubled history - director Simon Wells (HG's great-grandson) was replaced by an uncredited Gore Verbinski - but you'd be better off with the wonderful 1960 version.</fullReview>

Who pays these people to write things like that? I mean, honestly, sometimes I go through the new releases looking for a movie that Roger Ebert HASN'T given "Two thumbs up!". Let's just say that if Mr Diehl is so impressionable that his mind is blown by this movie, he'd probably have to be committed to a mental institution if someone played him '2001' or 'Eraserhead'.Alright, this is not a bad movie. It's about what you'd expect. The 1960 version with groovier visuals and production values, but less atmosphere and imagination. There are a few nice touches that save it from being utterly plain: the holographic librarian, and the final scene(s), which are rather nicely done. I guess I'd have to say rent something else instead, but if you've really run out of promising candidates and it's a choice between this and 'Zombie Island Massacre', go for this one.

So much for the "timeless classic", as it has been described. This latest version is better - much better, in storyline, acting, effects. The romance between The Traveller and the Eloi girl did not seem out of place. His fiancee (not wife, as stated in another review) had been killed four years before he completed his machine and he seemed to be more interested in the world of the far future than brooding over it.

As well as in the 1960 movie (which was anti-war), this one also has a "message", dealing with ethnic groups. I think H.G. Wells would approve what his grandson (director Simon Wells) did with his novel, as well as George Pal, the director of the 1960 film (there are a couple of tributes in this new version), which was fun, but not as great as some persons say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The special effects were excellent (but then, what movie made today doesn't have excellent special effects?). The story was also decent, particularly the portions that dealt with his early life in London. The ending destroyed all that was good about the show. First of all, the idea of interfering with 800K years of evolution is an almighty presumption. I suppose it's our personal conceit that there should never be a beast anywhere that would use humans for prey...after all, we are superior to everything are we not? Secondly, the thought of having destroyed a single small zone wherein the Morloks and their super sentient boss dwelt eliminated the entire problem worldwide is asinine. As soon as the empty zone were discovered, another group from some distance away would simply move in and the original problem would reappear. The manner in which it was accomplished was equally ludicrous. If the super sentient were able to read our hero's mind, how in the world would he miss a potential death threat to himself?..it would stand out in the subject's mind like a drum beat at midnight. Furthermore -- assuming our hero gave a little thought to the problem -- why would he want to eliminate the only being that could prevent the Morloks from wiping out the entire human population? He had no way of knowing that killing the superman would not result in just turning them loose and letting them run amok, thus killing every living human on earth within a month or two. The movie had some very good points until the climax approached, at which time I think the writers got carried away with what they fondly believed to be their superior creativity (over H.G.Wells) and decided not to think about what they were writing --- just slap down an ending that seemed ok, and let the special effects and the background music enchant everyone. On the whole, the movie was good but the ending destroyed it. Like a good joke that is wonderfully interesting until you get to a punchline that is neither funny nor sensible. While the special effects were superb, I must say the movie lost all the charm of the book and much of the earlier version made in the 1960's. All-in-all, a promising start and 90 minutes of wonderful realism was destroyed by an ending consisting of just a few minutes of mindless nonsense.</fullReview>

The effects and everything are so real that it's easy to believe you're watching a real Morlock 800,000 years into the future. In addition, the cast and crew really knew what they were doing.

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, but sort of awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine starts out wonderfully. Through events, it asks: Can you change the past? The lead character sacrifices his career (and maybe his sanity) to find a way to travel back and change a certain event that upset him. What he finds surprises him, and discourages him.Unfortunately, he then ends up going forward in time, to the distant future. From here on it is like a different movie. The main character has a new challenge, and a new love interest. The movie becomes one that no longer asks if he can have his past life back, but asks whether he is now happy?The juxtaposition of the two plots is jarring. You care first about the original question, then you are asked to forget it -- and the motivation for the main character creating a time machine -- in favor of a new story line that is not especially convincing.Still, at the very end, the movie tries to pull it all together, even employing a split screen between the two plot "worlds" and asking: Is he happy? That ending is touching and makes one think, at least a little. But at least half the journey there leaves you wondering, "why?"I gave it a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw THE TIME MACHINE the day it came out. So I guess you could say that I was eager to see what it would be like. I wanted to see how Simon Wells, the great-grandson of legendary author H.G. Wells could handle his grand-daddy's story. Well, he handled it a hell of a lot better than who directed the original did. This movie gives us an insight and view as to what the world might REALLY look like in 800,000 years from now. Definetly not some moron people who get names like Weena and go into some moronic trance whenever they hear a certain sound. Oh, no! This version of the classic tale is much much better.*POSSIBLE SPOILER* Guy Pearce is great as the eccentric mathematician who tries to go back in time to reverse the events of his fiance's tragic death at the hands of a Central Park mugger. The results are worse than what he ever could have imagined and he is sent forward 800,000 years into the future where he finds humans seperated into two surviving races. The Eloi who are people, and the Morlocks, creatures that come from the sands to take prisoners and stuff. Only, this time around, the monsters actually look like monsters. Not just some stupid fat men wobbling around in cardboard masks with blue rugs on their backs. No, this time they look like muscular creatures that can kick some ass. In the 1960 version, all they did was wave their arms in the air at the prof. C'mon! If you were a hairy creature that was hungry and wanted food, would you just walk slowly towards your prey waving your arms? Or would you jump on their back and rip their head off? The Morlocks actually give up a fight this time. And the Uber-Morlock (Jeremy Irons) doesn't really have a big part, but the part he does have is good. I give this version of the classic tale 5/5. 1960 version: 0/5</fullReview>

Perfect looks, I would say, at least for my own needs.But after watching the whole picture, there is a big flaw in it. To my big surprise, it turn out that the story itself looks quite thin compared to the rest. All these money, talent and resources for this very simple and only very weakly explained end ? What a waste !However, the movie is still very entertaining, with many jokes, I especially liked the last one, and it is quite romantic.I was also amused that the big catastrophe to end our current culture happened in the year 2037 - one year before the signed 32 bit Unix time counter will overflow. Was that an insider joke or part of the original book ?And it was very interesting to see what Wells thought the problems of the future might be. Of course he was very wrong !Good entertainment, even if the story itself is a little bit slim.</fullReview>

First, the story is completely crap faced(one word or two?). Second, Uber morlocks...c'mon...really. Third, Jeremy Irons can ruin a movie fast, we need to take his oscars away from him. Bad Jeremy! Bad! Fourth, somehow Hollywood keeps getting away with changing books, I know I know, some changes are needed for flow of story and action purposes. But man! This is awful. Fifth, somehow the eloi change from childlike blueish things to a hottie and some people in tarzan fashion. Sixth, then you have the morlocks coming out in daylight, and of course the always needed lame love story Hollywood always feels compelled to throw in.(I think it's to get women in because they like that crap. If I were you women I would file a suit against Hollywood for degrading women.) But I could go on for days ranting and giving opinions of mine that no one cares about so I will just say.

		<shortDescription>I wish I could go back in time to before I saw this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of time travel has long captivated humans, and thus it is natural for us to expect a movie centered around that idea to in some way reflect that fascination we all exhibit. The Time Machine, however, transforms what should make a rather enjoyable film into a near mockery of the idea itself.The movie's basic premise centers around one man's obsession with time travel and his determination to change the past. As he attempts to alter his own future, he in turn adversely alters the future of the entire planet as well. While this, a basic idea faithful to the book, comes off as rather intriguing, the similarities of the movie's plot with that of the book sadly end here, which induces the movie's descent toward absurdity.Alexander, the main character and creator of the time machine, operates amid an atmosphere of intelligence, surrounded by textbooks and chalkboards filled with mathematical equations, yet throughout the course of the movie he displays no sense of intelligence himself. As his time travel into the future progresses, the conditions in which he finds himself rapidly deteriorate, but he never once considers traveling backwards. One might think that after the first five or six near-death experiences he faces he might possibly realize that the future isn't improving, yet this simple revelation never once crosses his mind.The various situations Alexander faces are laughable in themselves. Most ridiculous is the premise of the moon suddenly breaking apart and crashing into the earth, causing widespread panic and death. Here, Alexander not only lives through this disaster but also chooses to go further into the future. Although the planet has miraculously been healed from the trillions of tons of rock that have been hurled toward it, for some reason there are only two creatures left alive on the planet. One is a race of humans that has shown absolutely no affects of evolution over the hundreds of thousands of years Alexander has traveled into the future (some of which speak English, conveniently enough), and the other is a race of ogre-like humanoids that lives under the ground and occasionally surfaces to consume the human race.After a series of unintentionally hilarious fight scenes and the obligatory rescue mission, the movie comes to a close with some weak attempts to allow some sort of theme to transcend. All that transcends from this movie, however, is a sense of disappointment caused by the lack of care used in throwing together a less than mediocre cash-in on an original. The moviemakers' greatest fallibilities lie in their apparent need to introduce radically new ideas that simply are over-the-top, detracting from any sort of plot (or lack thereof). These alterations are as unnecessary as the remake itself, and thus it will be the original that people are still renting in the future. In short, don't go into the theater expecting to be amazed or moved by The Time Machine; instead, don't go in at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caution: if you have read Wells' novel then this whole review is a spoiler!Having read the novel and also in 2001 having chanced upon the page on this site, stating that the film was 'in production', I was excited at the prospect of the 1960 version being improved upon. How disappointed I was to see the final result! While this 'remake' is well produced and reasonably acted, and the special effects and film score make it easily enjoyable, they should have given it a title that distanced itself from Wells' novel. Apart from the title itself and the existence of Eloi and Morlocks, it bears no resemblance to Wells in the slightest. Yet again we see Hollywood arrogance in moving the location from London to the USA (and they get an Australian to play the lead??) The Eloi were never meant to be black. This is not racism, it's fact. And that ridiculous hologram character in the library? C'mon! As for the Jeremy Irons 'Uber-Morlock', where did that come from? He seemed to have been added to tie up the loose ends that so much story-tampering had created.The 1960 version, while staying fairly close to the book, was heavily abridged. This time I hoped for something more substantial. The people responsible had the chance to create a film that did real justice to an excellent novel (as with Lord of the Rings) but they have failed miserably. Or, to be more accurate, they didn't even bother to try.As a time travel movie - 6/10. As "The Time Machine" - 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Hollywood underestimates the intelligence of its audience by torturing a socially-conscious novel into an over-hyped, under-cooked popcorn movie. Do the guys at Dreamworks seriously believe we are so unintelligent that we cannot cope with a decent adaptation? Would we all run screaming from the cinema, demanding our money back because there weren't enough romantic scenes, chase sequences, plot holes, or cortex-splintering special effects? I doubt it. Or maybe their reasoning is more sinister: perhaps a dystopian fantasy about an effete leisure class living off the abject misery of a race of underlings is simply too close to the actual relationship between Hollywood executives and us, the audience. But hey, it wasn't all bad, I guess. The time machine itself was beautiful, and the initial trip to 2030 was superbly done. The music wasn't bad, either. And Guy Pearce did a fine job, given what he had to work with. All up, I think I enjoyed about 90 seconds of the total running time ? which is more than I can say for "A:I". Much more. I wish Hollywood would just leave sci-fi novels alone - or have the guts to do them properly. God protect us from whatever Castle Rock is currently doing to "Fahrenheit 451".

		<fullReview>The newer remake of THE TIME MACHINE, based on the classic book by H.G. WELLS stars Guy Pearce (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, MEMENTO) as an inventor, who after losing his fiancee to an accidental murder, is driven to build a time machine, so he can go back to save her. More things happen, and eventually, he travels into the future to find WHY he can't change the past. After going VERY far into the future, with some impressive special effects, he finds himself in a minority of humans, against the majority, the vicious Mordoks, an evolved race of hunters. In a last effort, he tries to save the humans, but in the progress might have to give something up to do so. THE TIME MACHINE heralds a cameo by Jeremy Irons, who sadly was in the film very briefly, and the best creature effects artist ever, Stan Winston (Terminator 1 &amp; 2, Predator). Unfortunately, this was the most dissapointed I've been with Stan Winston's work. The Mordoks look like they should be on Sesame Street. Apart from this, the movie itself (of which was directed by H.G. Wells' great grandson) really just failed. The acting was pretty good on Guy Pearce's account, but probably his least memorable performance. The end sequence had pitiful graphics, and the camera moved around so furiously I couldn't even see. ( That's pretty bad if I couldn't make it out, considering I loved Behind Enemy Lines) This movie isn't completely horrible, but it was a big dissapointment. I new the movie wasn't supposed to be great, but I expected more from Pearce, Winston, and a longer sequence with Irons.2/5 stars. Worth viewing once. Maybe.</fullReview>

Movies and books take us to different times and places at will, but we cannot change what is written. The world is divided into writers (Morlocs) and readers. The writers are in control -- they maintain us merely as food for their appetites. The war depicted in the book (and more briefly here) is a war of readers to wrest control. Unless we do, the future looks bleak.This was Welles' genius.

		<fullReview>like my summary says, I saw this preview as a kid and was absolutely astounded. The effects, the story, the magic... the film looked amazing. Sadly I never had the opportunity to watch this film, I found myself detained to the educational viewings which I was limited to at the time. Despite these educational shows being a positive influence on my life, I WAS BORED! I didn't want muppets or Bill Nye or Disney movies! I wanted action, suspense, and explosions. So 20 years later I reluctantly popped in this worn out disc which I had gotten from the neighborhood Block Buster and what I got... was THE TIME MACHINE. First of all I have one simple issue with this film. The main protagonist, whatever his name was, is a complete loser who spends all his time staring at mathematics and barely sees the life of day; and for some odd reason he is able to score some really hot chick who loves him for "who he is" He has this loser friend who he hangs with... he's a real fat dude. kinda pompous. I don't know if McDonalds was around then but the basic existence of this fat pudgy character is reason enough that this restaurant should be avoided. Then there's some crazy old woman he stays with who is delusional or something for letting this whacked up Bill Nye reject stay with her. Nevermind these unimportant undeveloped characters. I don't want to give anything away but basically the random hot chick gets shot. Bill Nye reject draws some weird math formulas and creates this humungous TIME MACHINE. With this machine you can only guess... Bill Nye reject goes back in time. He tries to save her but she gets ran over by a wagon. Eventually Bill Nye reject comes to the conclusion that he can't change the past so he must go into the future... "makes sense right?". Now he goes to the future in his TIME MACHINE, and lands in some futuristic cities. So check this out, Bill Nye reject has this big obnoxious time machine in the middle of the street and nobody notices it. Classic. Now he meets this intelligent black hologram who looks like the local stalker who just escaped from prison. The black hologram talks to him about the time travel being impossible so Bill Nye reject goes into the future again to see the moon blowing up. But in the midst of danger he is able to use THE TIME MACHINE, to escape into an even more futuristic future. Once he arrives here he sees a war between a tarzan village and some creature that look like Demonic Muppets. And trust me, these suckers could swallow up Big Bird in one bite. He fights them gets the tarzan chick saves the world bada bing bada boom. Now here is the best part of the movie... we go back to the past and see the fat dude and the old woman talking about how long he has been gone. Bill Nye reject has been gone about a year and they act like he just left yesterday. COME ONE FAT DUDE DON"T YOU CARE ABOUT SOMETHING BESIDE YOUR DONUTS! If you had been nicer to Bill Nye reject he could have transported you to the present so you can have a Crispy Creme donut. But NOOOOOOO! So the sum this film up what can I say... it wasn't the explosive thrill ride with twists and turns that I had expected it to be when I was young, but it was still a solid good time which brought the child back in me. Well actually it kind of ruined my image of Bill Nye, the muppets, and basically every Disney movie I saw as a youth. But whatever! So if you ever have time and it's rainy outside and you don't have a girlfriend/ life or you're just simply too much of a failure to get out of the house.... pop on the pop corn maker sit back relax and hitch a ride on THE TIME MACHINE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Missed Opportunity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest problem for The Time Machine, is its heritage. Both the Wells' book, and the George Pal 60s film. When held in comparison, it doesn't stand favourably. It works best, when you try and distance yourself, and view it simply as a fresh new story.It's biggest mistake, is the time travel. That is the film's central core, yet instead of enjoying a passage of time through various stages of history, we get two VERY brief glimpses of the near future, and then the far distant Eloi and Morlocks. It desperately needed some feeling of exploration, instead of simply bypassing everything in about five minutes worth of montage. The core of the original, both film and book, is the protagonist's vision of how time does, and doesn't change man.It's other major error, is in its motivations, though you can understand why they thought it was a good idea. The film maker's attempt to give the Time Traveller an emotional basis for his efforts, with the death of his fiancée. On the surface this seems a good idea. However, by doing so, we are robbed of not only his sense of exploration and adventure, but his reasons for travelling to the future seem flimsy at best. Not only that, but it forces the film to spend unwarranted time on this subplot, before we delve into the interesting aspects.Thirdly, the finale is so mindless, that it makes little sense. The 'explosion' of the time machine, is so utterly contrived a plot device, simply for an alternative to the old 'blow something big up for the end' trick. How does he know his machine will do precisely this, when he sets it to malfunction? What makes him think he will have enough time to get the girl out and save her by doing this? It just feels utterly contrived, and tacked on for the sake of a wham-bam Hollywood finale.If we do compare the versions, it's surprising how this veers even more from the book (considering it's director's relation) than the Pal version. Lost is the contrast of the practically helpless Eloi, as they simply appear to be a fairly self-sufficient tribal race. The Morlocks, who originally came over as abominations, hideous debased humans (despite the dated make-up of the time), now come over simply as mindless animals. While Jeremy Irons' Uber-Morlock is an attempt, too late in the game, to provide a central villain to defeat.It had real potential, and despite its flaws, is an enjoyable enough romp. Unfortunately, that's all it is, and it seems a shame that even with all the extra time, money and effort, it still couldn't equal, let alone surpass, its 1960s predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Time with the Time Machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever been mugged or reached in your pocket and wondered where that five-dollar bill went? Well that is how I felt after seeing Simon Wells and Gore Verbinski's "The Time Machine." The only difference is I wished that were how the money disappeared. My expectations for the film weren't that high going into it because the trailer didn't spark my interest one bit. The only thing that I thought would help me out was the cast consisting of Guy Pearce (Alexander Hartdegen) and Jeremy Irons as Uber-Morlock. The movie is based on H.G. Wells' novel "The Time Machine." Alexander is a man that is determined to prove that time travel is possible. He builds his own time machine and sets off to change the past after his girlfriend is killed. He feels that he will be able to change the past and keep this from happening. However he finds out how much times have changed. He discovers that man not only is still the hunter but they have also become the hunted. The set designs did a great job of differentiating the time period and the computer animations during the time travel was neat to watch. Unfortunately this is where the enjoyments stopped. If only the movie moved as fast through time as Alexander did, I might have enjoyed the movie. Looking back I really don't remember that much of the movie. Other than trying to keep my head from hitting my chest is boredom. "The Time Machine" did nothing but make me wish that I had pillow and a blanket to pass the time. Many ask if you had a time machine where would you go? I may not have an answer for that question, but I do know where I wouldn't go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe This is Why Guy Pearce Stopped Getting Good Roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not read the H. G. Wells story of the same name, so how much blame I can give to the original author and how much blame to the screenplay writer for the plot I am not certain. Some elements are interesting while others remain completely ludicrous.The story is of a man who loses his one love and becomes a time traveler, partially with the intent to save her (very much like "Timecop" in a sense) and in the grander sense to find out why man cannot change his history. The elements I found most interesting were his attempts to travel in reverse, creating somewhat of a "what if?" scenario. The future world, however, was rather boring and less interesting the farther in the future he went (contrary to my assumptions).The usual time continuity problems exist in this film that you have to ignore to enjoy the film. Although Guy Pearce was very nice in "Memento", he was just alright here... so my enjoyment was minimal regardless. Another time problem exists outside of the continuity (a library in the future has the mai character's collected writings despite no such writings existing) and reference is made to the Wells story, which seems really absurd if you think about it.The Morlocks did not impress me. The computer animation was a turnoff, I felt the creatures were far too removed from humanity to be believable, and the leader was more of a nuisance than a respectable villain. Not to mention his relation to the main character was quite vague.Overall, I was not impressed. The same story with a different director and with a slightly different morlock vision might have been very nice, but enough elements of this film were not to my liking that I cannot offer a positive recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Runs out of steam after the first thirty-five minutes !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Time Machine film of the 1960's was a classic and a memorable film with an emphasis on time travel and good period reconstitution. This "remake" if it can be thus termed does not give me the same impression ! The first thirty five minutes,i.e. the time our hero takes to actually reach the year 802701, are quite thrilling what with him trying to thwart the death of his fiancée, visit to a science museum in about the year 2030 and the awesome possibility of a broken-up moon wreaking havoc on earth. The main voyage through time, where our hero is unconscious in his machine and the modification of the earth's crust etc is well-done, special effects and soundtrack-wide ! So much for the good part but that only represents 35 minutes of the film. Once he has arrived at his final destination, things become frankly quite boring and soporific, and the whole set looks like some kind of prehistoric adventure film - you almost forget that it was a time-travel film in the first place and time travel doesn't even enter into the script. I was hoping that he would end up returning to his own time at the end of the film but there was not even that saving grace ! One feels that in this film, the time-travel aspect was just a starting-off point for a banal adventure film depicting conflict between two classes of people, the Eloi and the Morlocks whereas in the original film, these same creatures/beings were part of the film without necessarily dominating it to the same extent, and in the remake there is certainly a lot more unnecessary violence than in the original, presumably to satisfy todays audiences' thirst for this. In the year 802701, apart from English people are speaking another language. We are not told what this language is, and there are no subtitles during the passages where the people are speaking it - an INCREDIBLE oversight on the part of the film director as how is ANYONE supposed to understand. The introduction of Jeremy Irons as a super Morlock or whatever he's called is also superfluous and overblows the whole affair. I can understand the film pleasing a certain type of person who enjoys adventure films of the 21st century but I cannot see it over-pleasing true time-travel addicts as the final hour is little given over to that aspect. But I do have the film on DVD and usually watch those first thirty five minutes before turning it off or putting on something else. The passage of time throughout the initial voyage is impressive and reinforces my anguish at the fact that in the earth's history, our own passage as human beings on this planet for a tiny fraction of the total time the planet has been and will be in existence, is something VERY VERY difficult to accept !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Samantha Mumba was alright, but how about Guy Pearce???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason you people in the United States give an "R" rating to a movie that show bare female breasts. To keep this movie to a PG rating Samantha Mumba had to cover up, somewhat, her nice breasts. She wore top that was pretty much see through, but still enough to allow a more permissive "PG" rating. You guys may not believe this but we actually like to go topless; particularly when the weather allows. There was a scene in the movie when Samantha should have been not only topless, but nude (due to that part of the story). In fact, it looked like a few parts of the scene were filmed with her at least topless (viewed from her backside so her breasts were not showing), but later she appears wearing a shirt. But, I am digressing. My main complaint about this film is that Guy Pearce did not appear topless!!! A man can appear topless in a film and it not only keeps a PG rating, but even a G rating so why didn't they let him go shirtless???!! I am so upset about that!</fullReview>

There only two scenes in the entire movie that you can tell are fake. Obviously the morlocks are fake, but can you tell by looking at them? No. And I haven't read the book, but even if the movie is different from the book, it is still a good movie. For one, the time machine really looks like it would take you through time, the computer graphics are amazing when he's going to 802,701, and the whole Eloi civilization is breathtaking. Living on cliff sides?? Genius. The fight scene with Alex and the hunter morlock is awesome, and the encounter with the uber morlock was so well written. All in all, this is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An admirable re-make of the 60's version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was worried that this re-make would be disappointing because the 1960's Rod Taylor version made such a monumental impression on me as a child. If if wasn't for the immense talent of Guy Pearce, Jeremy Irons, Orlando Jones, Sienna Guillory and Ms. Mumba, this would have been another CGI-laden piece of pseudo-scifi crap. The love story was brought to the foreground more than it was in the 60's version. The comedy provided by Mr. Jones was much appreciated. Ms. Guillory is beautiful and wholesome unlike most of the young actresses of this era. Ms. Mumba was a breath of fresh air as a woman of color in a major role. She is passionate, beautiful and sincere. I hope to see more of her in the future. The set designer deserves an award. The 'time machine' was an interesting piece of machinery. The time change sequences were believable and exciting. I whole heartedly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparing to 1960 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1960 version of The Time Machine was one of my favorite movies as a child. However, I like the 2002 version much better. I do not want to insult the 1960 version; for its time, it was very good. However, comparing the two, I can summarize my thoughts (sorry, I don't think I can do this without some spoilers):1) In the 1960 version, the "reason" for the time traveler ending up 800,000 years in the future is that he was buried by lava from a volcano set off by a nuclear bomb in London (yeah right!). In the 2002 version, he hits his head and is knocked out as the machine travels very far into the future.2) In the 1960 version, the Eloi are basically annoying beatniks and the Morlocks are 1950s-style monsters. In the 2002 version, the Eloi are struggling to maintain a society under the constant attrition of the Morlocks, and the Morlocks have a hive-type society with a telepathic leader (who keeps the Eloi in terror in their dreams). It may be that the 1960 version is closer to the book (where both Eloi and Morlock are weaker than the time traveler) but the 2002 version is more interesting.3) There is no explanation for the Eloi speaking English in the 1960 version. The 2002 version at least made an attempt at giving the Eloi their own language. It still may be questionable that they could retain English, but this is the best I could expect.4) The leading lady in the 1960 version (Yvette Mimieux) played a part typically contrived and uninteresting. I would not expect more from a movie made in 1960; its a sign of the naive and narrow times. Samantha Mumba is far better as Mara. Besides just being plain hot (which I must admit affects my judgment considerably), Ms. Mumba clearly depicted someone fearful but resigned to the situation.Having praised the 2002 version of The Time Machine, I will be fair and mention a few minor grips about the 2002 version:1) The counter of years on the time machine was all screwed up. The years, tens of years, hundreds of years, would all flip together. And what year did he end up in after he went further in the future?! 700,000,000? That's stupid; he should have only gone another several hundred thousand years.2) I would have preferred that they have the Morlocks still be so light-sensitive that they couldn't go out in the daytime. This is how it was in the book and the 1960 version. I realize that they wanted the Morlocks to catch the Eloi by surprise, not in their homes at night. Since the moon was supposed to have broken up, maybe sudden eclipses could occur and the Morlock attack then?All in all I really enjoyed the 2002 Time Machine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a dumb, pointless movie - and yet I've seen it two or three times, and I never fail to enjoy it. I guess there are more than a few other movies that this applies to, but, unlike with most, after watching "The Time Machine", I'm not left wondering about "what might have been"; I'm perfectly happy with what they produced. Funny, too, because I've read the book (which I like well enough), and I know this film is not at all true to it. They made a crappy movie here, obviously, and that, somehow, is just fine by me. In fact, I'd like to see more crappy movies like this. Yes, if someone told me of a future film that "It's like that awful Time Machine movie with Jeremy Irons and Guy Pearce," I'd promptly say "Ugh" and run off to buy my own ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A serious disappointment to anyone who has read - and appreciated - the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The time traveling aspect of this movie was excellently done: it was enough, in fact, to prompt me to watch it twice just to absorb it all. But the fundamental philosophy behind H.G. Wells' masterpiece is lost on the producer of the movie (Wells' descendant, no less) in favor of a basic "Eloi good Morlock bad kill Morlock" philosophy.Basic spoilers for the book follow: I'm going to keep this short and sweet. It was implied in the novel that the Eloi and Morlocks were interdependent - the Eloi provided food for the Morlocks (the Time Traveler found an Eloi corpse in the Morlock caverns), and the Eloi rely on the Morlocks to produce their clothing and other manufacturing needs (this is never directly stated, but the Time Traveler speculates on how the Eloi get their clothes, having no manufacturing capabilities. Within the Morlock caverns, he sees signs of industry. The implication is clear). The Eloi fear and probably hate the Morlocks, but they need them, and thus must tolerate their existence.This is completely lost in the movie. Instead, the Morlocks are simply vile creatures who can be destroyed with no negative impact on Eloi society. Basically, this was a major disappointment, because otherwise, the movie wasn't bad: well-written, well-directed, though they did stretch my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point (learning an entire language from public signs?!). Not worth seeing three times, but maybe twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original from the sixties and I haven't read the novel, but considering how iconic those are, I can't imagine this being quite up to the same standards. The 2002 version is just an FX-adventure, that starts off well and is even thoughtful in the beginning, but then it transforms Pearce in to Van Damme and I think that's enough said. At the end of the movie he looks more like John McClane than a scientist, which would've been fresh. This is not the film's only downfall. I didn't believe the romance between Pearce and Mumba (who does look fine) for a second. Not that I'm a racist, but his wife had just died in a tragic way and the character doesn't seem to be the kind of fellow who'd just start a new relationship right away (even for a rebound). Irons and the awesome time traveling sequences bring a couple of stars for The Time Machine.*** / *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't as bad as Planet of the Apes but not as good as it could have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To get the ?review' part out of the way ? I felt this was an interesting re-imagining of the original story. The visuals are pretty good; the design of the time machine was nice but maybe a bit too nice, too stylish.Didn't really like Guy Pearce's performance at all ? it seemed forced and very uneven. I would say this is a fun film to watch on a Sunday Morning as you're waking up, drinking coffee. The visuals of the Eloi village were wonderful but in contrast the computer generated sequences of the Morlocks running were pretty bad. It was entertaining enough to watch once (maybe on a rainy day) and not nearly as painful as watching Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes. I use that as a comparison because both films are pretty much `re-imagined' versions of classic films.Now?fixing the story; (semi-spoilers)A line from the film haunts me. `What If?'Of course many have pointed out that the story is much different than that of the book or the 1960 film, with that said the story could have been more interesting if they had simply made a few changes. First off ? what if the events that lead to the future world of the Eloi and Morlocks had been the results of some change that Alexander Hartdegen had introduced by traveling through time. Uber-Morlock almost hints at this with his comment of being `the inescapable result of you' but there is never a real explanation of that line. If, for example Alex had married Emma but neglected her with his obsession with time travel (perhaps to change some historic moment in the past) and when he disappears, they assume him dead and she marries Philby. As Alex traveled forward in time he thinks it was the right thing for him to do because they seemed so happy together BUT their grandchild is the designer of the Lunar base that ultimately destroyed the moon. This detail could have been easily told by the Hologram Librarian without it being too contrived. (BTW - I like this much better than the silly rings of knowledge.) Or even more simply, if through his travels he saves the life of some innocent person that of course brings about the future world.Either way, this would have played to the classic time travel rule - that even the smallest changes can be disastrous to the future ? a little more Bradbury than Wells but what the heck, it at least there aren't no damn dirty apes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this (terrible) film that hasn't already been said? Plotholes, goofy makeup, a classic updated simply so that there could be alot more 'splosions, bad casting, an ugly romantic lead, it has already been said and done before. one unexplained incident above all else angered and confused me beyond words.*****Spoilers, but you're going to read it anyway. Why does everyone always do this stupid spoilers thing on here anyway?*****The incident in question is the scene in the end in which the stupid pretty-boy main character kills off the "Uber-Morlock", the only person who keeps the fragile eco-system of the distant future in balance. You see, the morlocks eat the eloi. Uber M. controls the morlocks through mind control, and therefore keeps them from eating all of the eloi. Pretty-Boy is disgusted by the fact that the morlocks eat the eloi and calls them a perversion of every natural law, to which Uber M. replies "then what do you call time travel?" which immediately shuts him up because he just realized that he is a moron. Uber M. then explains to him the answer to the question that pretty-boy has traveled 800,000 years into the future to find, which was painfully obvious to anyone who owns half a brain and took five minutes to ponder over. Then, Uber M. gives him back his time machine and pocketwatch that he took earlier on in the movie and sends him on his merry way. Pretty-Boy, upon realizing that he is, in fact, a dumbass, attacks Uber M., kills him, and completely destroys the entire eco-system, which he goes forward in time to witness. He then immediately goes back, turns his time machine into a doomsday device by shoving his watch into the gears (that was another really stupid part that left me in awe. Or maybe it was pain. Yeah, it was probably pain), and kills off the entire species of the morlocks while he and Ugly Samantha Mumba escape just in the nick of time, while not even one morlock survived, which is funny when you consider that the morlocks were much faster and smarter than the eloi. All that they did, though, was stare at the explosion (or what ever it was) like deer in headlights.There was no point to him killing off the Uber Morlock, he just did. I guess that he was supposed to be the bad guy because he allowed the eloi to be eaten by the morlocks, but this is as flawed as calling God evil for letting the lion eat the antelope. It was the natural way of things and he totally screwed the entire thing up. Judging by the fact that everything that pretty-boy has done so far is as intelligent as pudding, building a time machine must be the easiest thing in the world. Of course it is possible that it was created in a freak accident while he was trying to make toast. You know, like the way Jar-Jar Binks did stuff in Episode I. I'm just starting to rant right now, so I'm going to end this review right... now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One deep moment doesn't make a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>******Spoiler Warning*********The original "Time Machine" story is so well known it's canon, and enough happens to make a decent three hour movie. Much was made of how H.G. Wells's grandson directed this one, yet the movie is a rushed blur that barely touches on the material and lacks the deep insight of the original story, the plot being replaced by neat special effects.Major flaws abound, such as:A common trend in all of Wells's stories was how we were on the cusp of a great age of mankind, where war and famine and politics would become dusty relics on the shelf. Practically all his characters strode forward expecting a glorious future; having our hero go back in time to save his girlfriend pretty much misses whatever Wells had to say, which leads to the next flaw.Our hero ponders how he cannot change the past; yet he had already done that by stopping his girlfriend from getting shot and somehow fate has to intervene to have her die yet again. From his earlier point of view his girlfriend now mysteriously runs off with someone (the later version of him) and he also met his friend, something the earlier version of himself would not know about. Somehow despite these changes the exact same events are supposed to transpire afterwards, but won't he be a little curious at what happened?The thinly disguised Polynesian islanders that are the Eloi in this story aren't particularly interesting, and we now have Morelocks that can run around in the daylight so why can't they live above ground? Seems it'd make more sense to hunt game or even grow crops than randomly grab Eloi (who don't reproduce very fast) as food.The only part of the movie that held any depth was the scene between Hardegan and the uber-Morelock where they discuss a few moments of philosophy; had the whole movie been at this level it could have been pretty good. Instead *bing* we drop right into action movie heroics to wrap it all up pretty quickly.In the end all that really stuck in my mind was Guy Pearce (a good actor in a bad part) pointing blankly at the librarian and mumbling "Photonic?" as if he was thinking 'what am I doing here?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie back in the theathers and fell completely in love with it. I liked pretty much everything about it, and in away it reminded me of the Planet of the Apes remake (which I also liked).Anyway, it starts out with Alexander Hardtegen, a teacher and an inventor, losing his fiancée when she is shot by a robber. Since Alexander believes in travel through the fourth dimension (time. This is explained in a deleted scene) he starts building a Time Machine (and a very beautiful one at that) to travel back in time and save his fiancée, but when this fails, and he realizes that he cannot change the past, he travels into the future to find an answer to the question "why cannot one change the past?". His first stop is 2030 where he meets Vox, a holographic character who is driven by a photonic sphere that links him to every database on the planet. Or as he explains it to Alexander "A compendium of all human knowledge". When Alexander tells Vox of his Time Travels Vox takes him for a crazy science fiction fan and simply ignores his questions. So Alexander travels further into time to the year 2037, where a big boom throws Alexander into his time machine and knocks him unconscious, while the time machine travels further and further into the deepest reaches of time...He finally manages to stop the machine in the year 802701 (or at least that what we are supposed to believe, but if you look at the panel just before you can see that number you can see that he has traveled beyond the 99900000 mark... a miss perhaps?). He finds a diffrent world than the one he left, a world where the peaceful Eloi live in their "huts" and hunt and fish for food and stuff that would would expect from indians... who just live for no purpose at all.Soon he encounters another race, the Morlocks, a fiersome monstrous race which hunt the Eloi for food and they look like they have a pretty bad breath. Alexander takes up the fight against the Morlocks and blah, blah. If you've read the book or seen the other movie you know exactly where it goes from there (well, at least if you've seen the old movie, the book tell a diffrent ending) and you know exactly WHO the Morlocks really are.But this movie is interesting and fun to watch. It has some really beautiful landscape montages when Alexander travels through time at the speed of light... or something...The movie is much like the old adventure movies where the man character can take on pretty much everything and beat the crap out of just about everyone and walk from the fight without a scratch, (however Alexander does manage to get quite alot of scratches and scars...). Its very interesting to follow Alexanders journey through time and his final stop in the distant future. The CGI graphics are great, and really fit in too this movie, the actors are good too (even the little kid who plays Kalen manages to pull it off!) and the music is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really AWESOME!!! Beautiful scenes, Ok actors, nice special effects, more than interesting story, cool action and some major things to think about... This is what this movie holds for you.I have seen this movie 3 times since I bought it about 3 weeks ago. Its that good! I give this movie a 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, monkeys of the future will once again run our lives and eat our brains. No this isn't "Planet of the Apes: The Pukey Version by Tim Burton" it's "GO SEE A GOOD MOVIE: Planet of the Apes: Time Thingy."*sigh* noone knows how to make a good scifi anymore. (FYI: Bruce, Arnold, Mel, et. al. make great *action* movies.)There were parts of this movie that, when it departed completely from the original, made it seem really decent. But alas someone said: "hey, i know! let's throw in some nonsequitor stuff from the original - it'll make it even better!"The only pleasurable experience in this movie is when the camera did a close-up of Omero Mumba and she: 1) smiled, 2) frowned, 3) had an expression, 4) had Ms. Mumba in the scene alone. Ohhhh, now I remember, that's what love feels like. I now know why what's-'is-name sailed to conquer Troy to see what's-'er-face! :)If you haven't seen the original then you might like this mish-mash of scenes slapped together to make what passes for a "story" in the modern age (2002). But if you had, don't see it. It's not worth the price of a rental... ok, maybe if there's a "VIEW 19 MILLION, RENT 1 FREE!" sale at the local video store.I didn't like it. The machine itself is the star, and like the space station in PotA, it too wasn't given enough time on the screen to make the movie worth watching.Anthony Irons was brilliant as the Head Morlock... he was even a nice guy about eating your brains.

The special effects on the underground dwellers was very good. The plot was different, a few minor changes and a few major ones. There was a leader of the baddies, an "uber-Morloch" played by Jeremy Irons, that stole the show - A Morloch with white hair, white eyes and telepathic powers. He wasn't in the first movie. His make-up was great and his role in the plot was credible and interesting. Another character, "Vox", a holographic construct played by one Orlando Jones, nearly single-handedly ruined the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie definitely does not stand up to the 1960 version starring Rod Taylor, but the failings are in the second half of the movie. The first half compares favorably with the earlier version (even the time machine seems familiar), but the second half is hard to take. There are many things that I did not like, but the Morlock hunters CGI movements were totally unbelievable. Overall it was worth watching once, if only to compare to the earlier version, but I doubt I will ever watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disappointing Version of A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>H.G.Wells' 'Time Machine' is probably one of the most often adapted to screen books. I have counted 14 titles in IMdB, and there are other with different titles as well - I remember 'Time after Time' - a good one about 20-25 years ago.This 2002 version is not one of the best. 'DreamWorks' studios continue to build their vision of a grim future, with lonely characters trying to save the day. I start to suspect that Spielberg's hand is behind many of them - this version looks in mood and atmosphere very much like 'A.I.'. However, as a film it lacks originality, and the message makes it quite heavily to the screen. Decent acting, a curious mix of conventional decors with already seen computer effects, Jeremy Irons playing a pale pervert monster - this movie does not bring anything that we have not seen before.I would also ask what is the audience of this film? In order to make it pass the puritan American censorship criteria it is almost totally cleaned-up of any bad language or sexual content. However, the effects and the monsters appearances (actually this is how mankind might look 800,000 years from now!) are that scaring, that I would try to avoid having my kids watch it if I see any early adds. Thus the audience might be limited to not much more than the sci-fi fans. I am one of them, but are we that many to justify this movie?</fullReview>

I liked the plot, the acting (Guy Pierce is becoming real good, I believe), and there is a couple of great action sequences, specially the ones that include the morlocks and the elois. Though it might not get an Oscar and it's not one of my favorite films, it did get me thinking. You might like it a lot or you might dislike it and you might even hate it, but I think I would recommend it.

I enjoyed the special effects. While some of the characters were endearing no time was really spent developing them. I feel so much more could have been given, perhaps eliminating the lame bit about the ill-fated fiancée and plotting out a full course for the folks in the future. I have to agree with some of the other comments regarding the 800,000 years into the future, 8000 or even 800 would have been more believable. Lastly, the movie was too short.

Guy Pearce did an Oscar worthy job at bringing the character of Alexander Hartdegen to life, and allowing the audience to sympathize with him. However as I said the ending was brilliant, and by ending I mean the last shot in the film. I won't give it away but in order to understand where I'm coming from pay attention to the conversation Alexander(Guy Pearce) and his friend David Philby(Mark Addy) have in the beginning. The last shot of the movie is shot through the window of Alexander's laboratory looking out onto the street and David will do something to end the film. Like I said if you pay attention to the conversation the two have in the beginning you'll know why it's brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Minor Spoilers*After a journey back in time to save his fiancée ends in disaster Prof. Alexander Hartdegen travels relentlessly forward &amp; eventually finds himself in the company of a tribe called the Eloi who are at the mercy of the monstrous Morlocks!In 1960 George Pal created a cinematic version of HG Wells' novel The Time Machine. Over 40 years later Simon Wells, the novelists grandson has given it a new treatment for todays audience. As in the original the basic plot - a time traveller ends up in the year 802701 where he encounters two races, the Eloi &amp; the Morlocks - is adhered to with a few embellishments over &amp; omissions from the novel. However this version does not compare favourably with the 1960 original.The acting for the most part is OK with Jeremy Irons in a bizarre role (more on that later). Guy Pearce isn't stretched by the material but convinces as a man driven through time by the loss of a loved one. What does not come across well is the friendship between him and David Philby (Mark Addy). As a viewer you are at a loss as to why theses two men would be friends? Samantha Mumba is passable in her first role although she doesn't have a lot to work with &amp; Orlando Bloom is entertaining as a Holographic librarian.The effects are good especially in the closing scene of the film, which wonderfully brings the past &amp; the future together. The modern time travel techniques are very similar to the original with a windowshop dummy reflecting the changing fashions in high speed &amp; there are other homage's to be found. The machine is different in design but has a familiarity with that used many years ago by Rod Taylor.For a film dealing with time it is very economical with it as this is a fairly short film by todays blockbuster standards clocking in at a mere 96 minutes. Indeed it is possibly too short, it would have been nice for Alex to stop off in more contemporary times &amp; get to see his reaction to recent events as Pal did in his travellers' deviations to WWI &amp; WWII. He only makes a couple of brief stops before the mainplot begins, once in the far future he is met by the Eloi &amp; soon after encounters the monstrous Morlocks.The Morlocks are an obvious technical improvement over those from 40 years ago apart from the fact that they no longer have an aversion to daylight. The Eloi themselves are vastly different to the ones portrayed in the original. It is never made convincingly clear why they do not retaliate against the Morlocks. They do not act like the evolutionary result of the idle rich &amp; seem quite self-sufficient. This is one of the main problems with the film. The Eloi are not seen as anything but good rather than their more ambiguous portrayal in the 1960 film.The main problem as a movie in its own right rather than a remake, is that it just isn't very exciting. There is never a real sense of danger, little in the way of thrills &amp; an all too brief &amp; quick confrontation between Alex &amp; the leader of the Morlocks, Jeremy Irons before the film ends.The character portrayed by Jeremy Irons. What can be said? Although he is good in the role he seems to have wandered in from another film. A super intelligent Morlock with ESP! Was he written in just to deliver further exposition to Guy Pearce, as is sometimes the feeling with Orlando Bloom? It's much more of a cameo than a full part &amp; when he says "Who are you to argue with 800,000 years of evolution?", you tend to agree with him - has Alex learnt nothing from meddling with time! Also his answer to the travellers question as to why he cannot save his wife is glaringly obvious to any fan of time travelling sci-fi cinema.Overall, as a film in its own right it is pretty forgettable. No sooner has the real meat of the plot begun then it's all over! Taken unavoidably so as a remake it fails on all counts save for the obvious advances in FX. It doesn't add anything to the story &amp; much like Tim Burtons recent Planet Of The Apes dilutes most of the intelligence of the original to leave a decidedly bland &amp; average summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>H.G. Wells would be turning in his grave right now if he knew how shoddily this film was done. The whole movie was rushed and incredibly unsatisfying. In the end, I was left with the feeling that our protagonist Alexander should have just left the time machine lever on ALL the way and never stop.And what the hell was wrong with the casting? The notable Jeremy Irons had a pitifully incoherent speaking part(maybe it was due to excessive ear wax in my ears, I dunno, but I thought he sounded unusually unintelligible). Guy Pierce's acting was disappointingly flat (he tried too damn hard in the beginning to act geeky and came out gawky instead, to say the least). And I felt no emotions whatsoever when his lady love died. Also, I could tell Samantha Mumba was uncomfortable in her role as Mara - who could blame her really for the incredibly bad script?For all its shortcomings, the movie did have some really good special effects, of which the image of the broken moon still stays fresh in my mind. A pity that the storyline didn't stick to the book like it should. This one is worth renting out on a rainy weeknight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollow adpatation of a classic work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that the director is the great-grandson of the author of The Time Machine, H.G. Wells (the founding father of science fiction) makes this film's tremendous deviations from the source material all the more shocking.The opening nineteenth century sequences are gorgeous and perfectly capture the look, feel, and wonder of the time and the story's premise, and not just because some of these scenes were filmed at Vassar, where I am a student! A previous review claimed these sequences were boring or drawn out, but this is not the case. Rather, they provide some of the more intelligent moments in the film.This intelligence, however, is short-lived. When director Wells chose to jettison theme of classism (the novel had the Morlocks as descendants of the working class and the Eloi as descendants of the capitalists) -- and replace it with a shlocky, standard romance-action story -- the wind was taken out of the sails of this classic story. Guy Pearce turns in a strong performance as the time traveler, while the actual machine itself is a gorgeous piece of ingenuity that actually looks like a plausible piece of nineteenth century equipment. (Frankly, this prop, and the initial time travel sequence to the future, made the entire price of admission worth it, and are two of the most fully-realized items/moments in any science fiction film.)While at its heart, the story of a nineteenth century man jumping on his Victorian era machine and blasting into the future will always be appealing no matter what the treatment, the film is ultimately devoid of feeling and purpose. A pity, because the original novel, one of the founding texts of science fiction, has yet to receive the perfect film treatment that it deserves.</fullReview>

Granted, there were a few scenes with fairly good special effects, but other than that, the movie was poorly made. It was much too short for all that needed to be put in. The first half was really interesting-getting into the psyche of the main character, but however the relationship between he and his significant other isn't gone into deep enough. This doesn't let the viewer see the pain and anguish he goes through in her loss. The end is just crazy. It seemed as though with 15 minutes of film left, they felt they had to sum up the entire story. Plot takes a back seat as they introduce a variety of new characters. I don't really recommend this movie to anyone-there's plenty of movies out there right now that'll make you laugh or keep you on the edge of your seat, instead of making you leave in confusion as the movie ends abruptly.</fullReview>

The 1960 version incorporated the paranoia of nuclear destruction into its storyline, which we are able to sort of smile at now. Sort of. The year is 2002 and the modern filmmakers have incorporated the OCD of "racial diversity" into theirs. With any luck when they get around to again remaking this in another 40 years, viewers will smile at the campness of what will then hopefully be an antiquated obsession, or certainly a less important concern.

For one thing the movie is only 90 minutes long and is supposed to cover 800,000 years of history. Three places are visited, and the majority of the movie is spent in a place that looks like the past that is 800,000 years in the future. This place is based on two different species spawing because of the moon falling.The movie really has nothing to do with time travel. The book cannot be that bad, and I hope that if I get a chance to read it, it will be a lot better. I want to rent the original and compare it!Horrible movie!2/10I give it a two because Guy Pearce is an awesome actor and because Memento is one of my favorite movies. It had two much of Orlando Jones in a serious role, when he is a comedic actor. Hell Jeremy Irons is a major charcter, and only has a 10 minute role. Just two many things happen that either not explained or don't make any sense for the movie. The one scene that comes to mind is where Jeremy Iron's character is going to let Guy Pearce leave in the time machine, and for no reason he attacks him. The one thing that Guy Pearce forgets is the only way to change the past is in the past, not the future.</fullReview>

(but the dates are the dates from the original book!) the storyline is good, characters are great, and the acting is wonderful. i think Guy Pearce does an flawless job of gradually going from the geeky intellectual to the full blown action hero. I can't think of another actor who could have pulled it off. Samantha Mumba is a nice surprise. i fully expect to see her in more roles in the coming future. i highly recommend this movie and think that Simon Wells did an excellent job with it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Lord, whoever wrote that essay about The Time Machine really must have no life at all. Sorry, to whoever you are, but how can you write such things about this film? I loved this film - i liked everything about it. The only slightly marred part of it was Jeremy Irons ; he was the only person for the job, but simply seeing him in another role like this was a little depressing, I always look forward to seeing him do something different- such as Lolita. But nonetheless, he was superb in the role.The story is interesting as well as faithful to the book (as much as a book-based film can be). The actors are excellent and everything about it is exactly what I would have wanted.Anyone who wants a lot of entertainment, as well as fantastic music (wait until the end titles, or when there is the pull-back shot of the Eloi's village over the river, it't just awesome) then just watch this film. It's not going to win any Oscars, but I love it anyway.So please ignore what that silly person said about it being a 1.5 hour endurance test, because he's talking a load of rubbish. The Time Machine is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the 1960 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1960s version was by far the best until the 2002 movie was released. The 1960 movie was obviously the gold standard for the producers of the 2002 movie to beat as they gave it credit in the film. That's understandable when you consider that the original movie was produced by George Pal, an academy award winning producer of American science fiction movies in the 1950s and 60s.The director of the 2002 movie used discretion when incorporating CG enhancements and enhanced the story line rather than trying to make the movie a special effects bonanza.I was a little disappointed that Alan Young didn't get a bigger part, he was the flower shop owner. He played the part of David Filby in the 1960 version. I was also disappointed that Jeremy Irons didn't have a bigger part, to secure a great acting talent like Jeremy and not use him to a greater extend is a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BACK TO THE FUTURE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE TIME MACHINE (2002) *** Guy Pearce, Samantha Mumba, Orlando Jones, Mark Addy, Jeremy Irons, Phyllida Law, Sieanna Guillory. Intriguing update of HG Wells' sci-fi classic novel with Pearce as a turn-of-the-century New York inventor/scientist whose eon skipping vehicle serves as the ultimate in What If scenarios as he tries to determine predestination and inevitable time frames limitations of the human spirit. Keen visual effects provide eye-popping imagery to the hilt despite a weak third act set 800,000 years in the future. Director Simon Wells is the great-grandson of HG.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best movie ever, some IQ required for watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Time Machine is one of the best films I've ever seen. At this moment I'd say it's the best film I've ever seen. I can't remember a film having that kind of effect on me in the cinema. It absolutely blew me away. It's the perfect SF movie, which is a minor achievement. What makes it incredible is that the perfect credible story not just "a animate clone" of the book, seeming to be a good receipt for a good movie. But it require a minimum IQ for watching and is not a movie for the week-end or for fun. The story is: Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) invents a time machine in the late 1800s that takes him 800,000 years into the future. There he discovers that mankind has evolved into two races: the Eloi and the Morlocks "..one of those staggeringly well-produced, joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next, hastily, emptily.." You must see more than once this movie, then you have the right to make a comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HG Wells's story is simply marvellous, and was done justice by the excellent 1960 film. However, while not terrible, this remake isn't particularly good either. Granted, the special effects are amazing as are the set design and sound effects, and Uber Morlock was intriguing. However, it is a case of style over substance. Also it is a rather poor adaptation of the book, with the story rather jumbled and anything that was so interesting and intriguing is diminished. It is also disadvantaged by bad pacing, so the film is rather dull too. The script is pretty awful, the direction is misjudged, the characters are shallow and the acting isn't great with the worst offenders being Samantha Mumba whose presence jars with the period and Orlando Jones whose comic interlude in a future library happens to be one of the film's worst scenes. All in all, watchable but disappointing. 4/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it doesn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible SPOILER. This is the second adaptation of Wells' famous novel, the first one was made in 1960 and had a certain charm thanks to Rod Taylor who was convincing in the personality of the Time Explorer (name given by Wells to his hero) and the shimmering photography. Unlike its predecessor, it's not successful at all. The movie is a betrayal of Wells' novel and it's the last straw when you think that it's Wells' great grand-son who is responsible of it; maybe he didn't read the novel very carefully. Simon Wells totally neglected the clever side of the Time Explorer. Instead, he created a Hollywood hero who's got one's attention focussed on her fiancée. The main actor doesn't succeed in recreating the personality of the Time Explorer. In the novel, the Time Explorer invented the time machine in order to discover the face of the tomorrow's world where he thinks that mankind will carried out spectacular progress in science and medicine (and we can say that in the novel, he'll be very disappointed). But here, he designed his time machine so as to rescue his fiancée and that's all. Moreover, if the two types of character of the year 802701 are well defined (the Elois and the Morlocks), the sceneries (like the Sphinx in white marble) and especially the philosophical reflection have disappeared. The main actor never wonders about the Elois and Morlocks' origin and the characteristics of the world in 802701. I also noticed that the novel's pessimism had been abolished, especially at the end of the movie when Guy Pearce starts his new life with the Elois whereas in the novel, he disappears in the future and never comes back... At the end: a betrayal of Wells' novel and a useless adaptation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A professor (Pearce) obsessed with time travel climbs aboard his Rube Goldburg gyro-thingamajig and gets catapulted through time 800 gazillion years where really nice cliff dwelling people, who conveniently speak English, live in dread of evil subterranean creatures...etc. His mission: To rescue the a babe from the clutches of the creatures. How original. Duh.Slammed by the critics and panned by the public, "The Time Machine" features good visuals and art and a plot which is so convoluted that it's easier to just go with it than to try to follow it. If you just want some great graphics and a busy no-brainer adventure flick to go with your munchies, "The Time Machine" may be for you. Turn off brain, kick back, and enjoy. (C+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Time Machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the opportunity to watch this on a plane to Florida, America, I had to see if I missed anything good, or not good, from director Simon Wells (The Prince of Egypt). Basically scientist and inventor Prof. Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is determined to prove the theory of time travel is possible, and after the death of his to-be fiancée Emma (Sienna Guillory) this becomes a desperation. Four years past, and without the knowledge of friend David Filby (Mark Addy), Alexander has succeeded in creating a "time machine", and the first place he goes is of course the day Emma was killed. Even after stopping the potential event to come she is still killed, and he knows it will happen every time he tries to stop it. So he decides to travel to the future to see whether time travel has been proved, and of course have the question of whether the past can be changed answered. He first tries the year 2030, where he stops off at the New York Library asking questions to holographic librarian Vox (Orlando Jones), and he is shocked to see the Moon breaking up just seven year later. Escaping from the devastation he get knocked unconscious, and unintentionally travels to the year 802,701 A.D., where the human race, or Eloi, has developed a new language (though English is still used occasionally) and a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. It is obvious though that the humans live in fear, when creatures known as the Morlocks, and Alexander is determined to help them before he thinks about going back to the past. He eventually meets the Über-Morlock (Jeremy Irons), who gives him an answer to the question to his past-changing question, before being destroyed outside the machine's time shield, travelling through time. In the end, Alexander decides to use the machine's time alternating power to vaporise the Morlocks, and he obviously stays where he feels happy, with Mara (singer Samantha Mumba) and her people. Also starring Phyllida Law as Mrs. Watchett and tom thumb's Alan Young (also starring in the original) as Flower Store Worker. This might have some pretty good special effects, Pearce might be alright, and Jones adds some light humour, but with some lazy sound effects, an underused Irons, and not enough excitement, the 1960 Rod Taylor classic is much more interesting than this lame and too quick-paced remake, but I suppose you can see it once. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup. Okay!</fullReview>
