		<shortDescription>Solid Remake, but the original "Rec" was far superior...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine is a remake of 2007 Spanish horror film Rec, which has been receiving amazing reviews from horror fans, including myself. It was tense, terrifying and had great acting. I only saw Rec a few months ago, and would say it's one of the best of the year. Hearing about a US remake so soon, especially one told to be shot-for-shot, was kind of ridiculous. However, the cast for Quarantine was good, the trailer and stills looked cool, so I thought I'd give it a watch to see how it holds up to Rec. Needless to say, Rec was better, but I still enjoyed Quarantine. It was better than the remakes of Shutter, The Eye and One Missed Call, that's for sure.Plot basically tells the story about a young woman who is filming with her cameraman at a fire station in Los Angeles, when they receive a distress call from an apartment. They head out, soon make a horrifying discovery regarding one of the residents and find themselves Quarantined by the government in the apartment building. It's exactly the same plot as the original, but it isn't actually shot-for-shot as there are a few new scenes thrown in there. Good ones, though. The acting was also strong, with Jennifer Carpenter being the lead. Manuela Velaso was better in Rec, but Jennifer did a really good job. I was surprised at the lack of Johnathon Schaech's screen time though, considering he was in nearly every scene in the recent remake of Prom Night. I loved Dania Ramirez and Jay Hernandez too.Quarantine has really good acting, is entertaining from start to the end, but it has it's flaws. The movie was actually a little slow in one or two parts, and some of the characters I didn't really care for, such as the cocky businessman. I am also rather annoyed by the lack of effort from the writer/directors of this film. Drew and John Dowdle are rather new to the business, and not only have they remade a film that is less than a year old, but the direction and writing just wasn't there. They took most of the screenplay from Rec, so if anyone deserves the writing credit, the original makers deserve most of it. The direction, well, was also lacking...because it's a POV movie and a lot of shots are similar to the original, so the guy clearly didn't do as much as a regular director because it's a POV remake. They have also lied to the audiences, saying that they changed the ending. So they are new to the business, remaking a film less than a year old and lying? Stupid. I feel that the actors, and the creators of the original Rec, made this film what it was. The only things the Dowdle brothers deserve credit for are for their new scenes (5-10 mins total, which probably took an hour or two to write) and well, assisting with some of the direction...oh, and also managing to collect huge paychecks for doing very little of what a normal writer/director would do.Overall, Quarantine was an entertaining remake after some of the lame ones we've had this year. It's nowhere near as bad as the haters are thinking it is, which actually doesn't make much sense, because if they loved the original...why hate a shot-for-shot remake? Unless it's because it has American actors, which again wouldn't make sense, as they are very talented actors. If you dislike POV movies though, this movie won't really be for you, so don't be an idiot and go and see it, and then complain about feeling sick...it's your own fault! Rec was the superior film, but overall, Quarantine was a good remake. But like I said before, if anyone deserves the credit for this remake, it's the original writer/directors (for the shots, writing and original - this remake wouldn't be here without them) and the actors of this remake. I do advise you though, don't be ignorant over a movie with subtitles, and check out the original Rec. It really is an amazing film.Quarantine (2008) - 7/10. Rec (2007) - 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as strong as the original, but still very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There must have been comedians in the projection booth the night that some friends and I went to see a family friendly film. These particular friends tend to watch only light-hearted material and get upset for weeks whenever they see horror films or intense thrillers. They were totally unprepared for a 'Quarantine' trailer and it shocked them all so badly that we nearly had to leave and get our money back. Maybe it was because of their strong reaction that my interest in the film has stayed so high for the past several months.This week I have seen both 'Quarantine' and 'Rec' the film that 'Quarantine' is a remake of. 'Rec' is not without flaws but it is a very solid and chilling horror film. 'Quarantine' is able to expand on several of the strengths in 'Rec' while falling into a few pitfalls of it's own. Both films are about a TV news crew taping a show about what a night in the life of a fireman is like. A seemingly routine call turns out to be something much more and the news crew is trapped in a quickly quarantined building.Giving credit where it is due, 'Quarantine' kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. It lures you in with a very relaxed opening ten minutes but once you reach the building and the cop in charge asks why the camera crew is there, the whole tone of the movie changes. The fun and games, the light-hearted banter is gone. We only realize how serious it is though when they enter the apartment of an injured old woman. For me the tension starts with the entrance to the apartment and never lets up. Each new segment that the TV crew starts filming holds potential terror. The set design and the lighting are terrific and 'Quarantine' walks a careful tightrope of character action. So often in horror films the audience is yelling with frustration at what characters on the screen are doing because it all goes against common sense. There is a little bit of that early on but 'Quarantine' does a better job of playing to the characters and their panic. Characters die not through naivety or stupidity as much as they do from inevitability and inescapability. The key performance comes from Jennifer Carpenter.The film's greatest strength and weakness at the same time, Carpenter is the focus of the camera because of her role as the reporter and it isn't an easy part to play. She is solid for the majority of the film but terror essentially overwhelms her with ten minutes to go and she is reduced to a sobbing, shrieking, shivering bowl of jello. Would I or anyone else be any better in the situation that 'Quarantine' creates? Hard for me to say but probably not. The problem is that there were three primary acting choices for her to make in the final ten minutes: she could play it as a hysteric (which she does), she could play it as numbing down her fear like the cameraman does in order to try and escape, or she could have been so overwhelmed by her fear that she becomes a functional catatonic working on autopilot. Carpenter's choice is probably the 'truest' choice for how people would react. That doesn't mean that it is going to make for good drama. Her transformation from confident and outgoing to hysterical jabbering is so jarring that it feels forced instead of real. The camera man keeps telling her to calm down when they've reached a potentially safe room but she is far beyond the calming down stage and well into the years of therapy one instead. I found it to be just too much and actually pulled me out of the horror and towards comedy instead.'Rec' felt a bit more organic and gritty than 'Quarantine.' The performances are decent in both but you feel less of a connection to the characters in 'Quarantine.' Many are clearly there to serve as fodder with no attempt to seriously develop them. 'Rec' does a much better job, particularly when the reporter interviews each of the buildings residents. The five minutes spent in filming those sequences gave more of a stake to the audience into the well-being of those characters. That never really takes off in 'Quarantine' and I regret that they didn't follow the lead of 'Rec'. One thing that I thought 'Quarantine' did a much better job of was in plot clarity and how they provided information. The clues to the source of what is going on are much more explicit and come very early in the movie. 'Rec' dropped a few hints for the viewer to put together but relies on the final five minutes to give the major clues about patient zero. What patient zero is spreading is clearer in the remake and I thought the clarity benefited the plot. Of course by the time you find out about patient zero, Carpenter's character is beyond being able to help provide the audience with anymore real analytical power. Don't blink or you'll miss everything you need to know.I give the slight edge to 'Rec', but certainly recommend 'Quarantine' to horror fans. It's problems aren't severe enough to detract from a very decent effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woah.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with fairly vague expectations - however I am a fan of scary movies, and not to mention a big fan of Jennifer Carpenter, could be good times. so lets go.woah.This movie was horribly fantastic! It was a ride, a very scary, very stressful ride, but an awesome one. True, this flick does not stray far from the typical zombie flick concepts, but I thought the execution was above par. The 1st person views, the sense of confinement/hopelessness, and the great acting (especially ms carpenter, extremely believable job of someone going hysterically frantic) One of the key things about this horror is the scares never let up, there is rarely a "breather scene" where you get to relax for any amount of time, it just keeps hitting you and hitting you.haha, phew. I truly enjoyed. check it out. cheers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>trying to review this without comparing to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, this whole hysteria of America ruining foreign films is laughable. Yes, there are some really bad remakes, but that does not effect the original film. You cannot ruin a film by remaking it as the original film is still the same. If you are angry, you are angry because you feel that people who really deserve the fame and recognition are not getting it. This is a justified reason to be angry, but don't go saying the film has been ruined because that defies all logic of possibility.I must say it's hard for me to review this film without thinking about the original, mainly because it is nearly a shot for shot remake. Obviously this takes away from the suspense and overall fear factor of the film. If you have seen the original, don't expect to experience the same level of terror that you had the first go round. You're going to know what's coming for the most part. If you haven't seen REC, this movie will probably scare you. If you actually have the option of seeing REC first, I would do it because I feel that it is still the superior movie. Of course, if you live in America your local video store won't have it and you'll have to download it illegally, so I guess you're stuck between a rock and a hard place.I actually thought the acting was quite good for the most part. Jennifer Carpenter does a great job playing hysterical women. She did a good job being hysterical in the Emily Rose abomination and she did a good job being hysterical in Dexter. She does a good job being hysterical in this movie as well, so kudos to the producers/directors for making a logical choice to cast her. Her dialogue outside of being chased down by rabid tenants is laughable, but this actually makes sense when you consider the fact she's a reporter for a show no one would watch anyways.The main difference between REC and this movie is the cause of the deranged building tenants. Surprisingly, I thought they made the story work and it played more on "American" fears such as government distrust, terrorism, and viral warfare. The only thing I think they failed on was the choice to use higher quality production. Part of what made REC really scary was the grittiness which gave you the feeling that what was happening was real. Although the camera work is choreographed well, the Hollywood quality takes away the grit and leaves you feeling like you've had a few too many before watching.Overall, I think this is actually a decent remake. The producers and director realized that the story was already awesome and they didn't try to change it. I think if people would calm down and put aside their national pride and cultural elitism, they would realize that these kinds of remakes only help foreign films. How many people knew about REC before this movie, outside of a small demographic of people (imdb is not the 'norm')? How many people know about that great movie now? Lots of people visit these websites looking for reviews, and seeing "REC" pop up everywhere is only good exposure. Hell, if this movie does well you might actually find copies of REC in your local video store, and believe me, I'd be the first in line to buy a copy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infectious Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even at a glance, it is clear that Quarantine has boarded the 'fad' bandwagon it two respects. Firstly, this chiller joins up with the abundance of remakes that choke the gullet of Hollywood, and at an impressively rapid pace I may add, duplicating its Spanish predecessor (Rec) within a year's time. Secondly, it is the successor in a line of films, some from earlier this year in fact, that adopt the hand-held camera technique (which may soon be classified more accurately as a gimmick) to construct a first hand, real time account of events. Yet, despite succumbing to these popular fixations, and the flag of death that is the studios reluctance to screen the film, Quarantine is crisp effective horror.When comparing (Rec) and Quarantine, the similarities are glaring. In fact, the films are almost identical, save a few altered snippets. Which is good in the sense that nothing was lost in translation and although nowhere near as disgraceful as remaking classics or art films, it still begs to ask the question why? Alas, the average viewer does not wish to read subtitles, especially when watching horror, so the update went through. Directed by newcomer John Erick Dowdle he makes the most of his debut. Procuring a larger budget then its inspiration, Quarantine looks better as a whole (despite more frequent incomprehensible shots involving darkness and jiggle cam) and is able to incorporate some effects into the production, such as a continuous and chilling shot of a person being tossed down a stairwell. Comparisons to 2008's earlier films Cloverfield and Diary of the Dead are unavoidable, and remains squarely in the middle; a far-cry from the ingenuity and atmosphere of Cloverfield, but avoids the horrendous acting and scripting of Diary.Mirroring (Rec) Quarantine begins with a reporter, Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) who hosts a late night television program. On this particular night, Angela and her cameraman Scott (Steve Harris) are doing a ride-along with the firemen of a local station in L.A., including Jake (Jay Hernandez) and Fletcher (Jonathan Schaech). After a tenuous night of boredom and anxiety, they are finally called to the scene of an apparent accident in an aging condo, involving an elderly tenant. Things are not as they seem however as soon after, the CDC seals off the building with the foursome, and the reaming residents still inside. Their reasoning is good it seems, as all hell breaks loose as a mysterious rabies virus rips through the building turning those exposed into zombie-like fiends. The survivors must work together to battle the infected, the authorities and each other.Both films incorporate the inherent problem of the disease itself, which seems to frequently shift in its required incubation period, but is not really a huge impediment for the film as a whole. The opening act which is situated entirely at the station is both surprisingly involving and witty, and works to some extent as character development. The finale is also pulse-pounding, if not entirely inspired, but lacks the sheer terror I felt at the finale of (Rec). When breaking it down, Quarantine's opening is better then the original, and (Rec)'s final act is better then its imitator, so things balance out. Each film boast a superb scene mid to late film, including the aforementioned stairwell plummet in Quarantine and a scene in (Rec]) involving the same stairwell in which the heroes peer down to see the lower floors of infected peering back; eerie stuff. I would encourage horror fans to see both before making their choice, and to be honest I haven't quite chosen myself which is superior. Regardless, Quarantine takes advantage of a ploy that has not yet become stale, and yielding authentic portrayals from its relatively unknown cast and an ominous atmosphere, this flick is infectious to be sure.See all my reviews at: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was...OK, at best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie a few months ago. Last night, I watched REC, the movie this one was based on. All I can say is I have no idea why they felt the need to remake it. the original is far better, whereas this one is...OK, at best.I almost feel insulted, as this movie was a stripped down version of the original. The plot isn't as dynamic, and the tension is not nearly as contagious - as if they felt a need to "dumb it down" for the American Audience. So - if you want to see what a GOOD low budget horror film is like, leave this one on the shelf and rent the original - you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the original before this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you didn't know. This film is another American-Remake. That's right. Once again, American underlings of the film-persuasion lacked any real originality or motivation to write anything of their own, so they chose to massacre an existing one. That isn't to directly say this movie is horrible. But the strange thing you may notice if you educate yourself is that the ORIGINAL had a plot, where as this one, sadly, comes out with little to NO plot.Now if you like the common films that have no regard to your intelligence or sense of accomplishment that one can get from watching a good film. (Like 'One Missed Call' 'The Ring' 'The Eye' etc). Then you will think I have no clue what I am talking about. However, if you're not a dolt, you will agree and wonder why this movie delivered the higher budget film, but removed the plot.The film is 85% it's original. However it does take some originality in developing the 'infection' earlier on in the plot, however you really don't get any explanation on much anything. (It's like they teased you with it. Although the tease being a very weak attempt at a conclusion).Honestly, you cannot grasp the entirety of this film without watching Rec. The same can't be said inversely, but both are enjoyable to watch.In conclusion if you just want a drive-by horror. Go ahead. If you actually want to have something to talk about with your friends, get Rec and this one and watch them back to back with the gang and make it your own discussion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May be my vote is so high, because I haven't seen the original, however it makes my judgment more objective, because I didn't have to compare anything except other horror movies, which use cheap camera from first person, which seems like is a new trend of all horror movies. And this is the only thing I don't like - may be the movie would not be so capturing if it would be taken in classic style, in other words, in my opinion such technique does not make so much effort from the director to make the scenes scary. On the other hand, due to lack of frame cutting there is very high pressure on actors. Whatever some here comment that they did not like the play of leading actress, I think she was very good, surprisingly good for quite unknown actress. Perhaps many thought that those hysteria scenes were exaggerated, but I'm sure that people in similar situations act exactly so disconnectedly. It seems that Jay Hernandez is slowly gaining his future popularity and I have nothing against it, he has quite good potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Silly but not horrific if you have the slightest clue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>btw...although some are calling this a "zombie" movie, there are in fact no zombies in it. Rabies DOES infect humans. The people who have been bitten in this movie are not dying and reanimating and trying to eat everyone --they are supposedly displaying the madness that strikes rabid dogs and running around trying to bite everyone just as the infected dogs will.It's difficult to imagine the reasoning behind some of the positive reviews calling this silly plot line good or effective or even just frightening. If you missed the advertising and aren't aware it's supposed to be a horror flick the beginning won't clue you in. That's actually one of the good points of the film, a fairly realistically done beginning (informational news piece on the life of a firefighter at the fire station) that provides a few glimpses of some of the man characters and allows the development of some liking and sympathy for them before getting to the action. This segment concludes with the reporter and cameraman riding along with the crew on a call involving a paramedic situation (rather than a fire) that even incorporates the nice touch of the cameraman telling the reporter "I can't slide down that pole with this camera!" and the two detouring to a run down the stairs to jump on the fire truck. The only bad points to this part of the movie was that it went on a little too long and it's impossible to believe a professional cameraman can't figure out how to focus his camera. After the news duo and firemen arrive at the dilapidated apartment building things quickly go south. the film is so DARK that the supposed tears all the victims show can't be seen, and the supposed salivating is actually vomit or blood in most cases. This rabies is scary because it causes disease in minutes instead of in "months" (rabies actually takes 3-8 weeks to develop in most people, and that's do to the physical limits of the virus moving up nerves to reach the brain, which cannot be genetically modified). (And yes, a veterinarian would know that...veterinarians know more about diseases that spread from animals to humans than medical doctors do. They have to...they're the ones most at risk to catch those diseases.)The CDC, working with the cops, somehow seals off the building (just after the fire department people and news crew get inside) because a man who lived there took a sick pet to the veterinarian and it "ran around biting all the other animals" who started "showing aggressiveness within an hour". Does anyone reading actually think sick animals run around in one big pen in the clinic instead of being kept in separate cages? Well, maybe the sick dog was running around the waiting room biting all the other animals being held by their owners? And of course not biting the owners.....? The CDC being notified and showing up the entire length of the country away THAT fast? For an unknown disease that only affects animals (remember, they said only the animals were showing aggressiveness)? Without the local public health people ever being called in? Let's not even mention that rabies doesn't usually take the furious form (like 'mad dogs') in humans. But it gets sillier.The CDC comes in wearing moonsuits and start taking samples to see what is causing the problem...with a drill at least 10" long they sink full length in fromt he top of the victim's head! What were they trying to get a sample of, his tonsils? BTW, rabies in living humans can be diagnosed by a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, which only requires a needle and syringe. Oh yeah, and don't forget they handcuff the guy to whatever he's lying on first. at his waist level...so of course he sits up --AFTER they obviously drilled his brain into mush and bites the other CDC guy, unhampered by handcuffs.No end to sheer stupidity yet. The child who owned the sick dog has had a slight fever for hours, but suddenly goes nuts and bites half her mom's face off...and the cop runs after her, kneels in front of her and assures her things are OK instead of shooting her from a distance --and of course gets bitten too. The building superintendent says he has in his apartment the key to a drain cover they can all escape through (in the basement) while standing in front of glass doors they just shut to keep out an infected guy, and gets bitten. The news crew runs up the stairs after getting the key, blathering about finding a way out that way although we all know by then its not possible, find an apartment full of rodent cages and clippings about doomsday cults and turn on a reel-to-reel tape at half speed but can't tell it's voices at half speed. And the absolute corker...the CDC prevent human egress but forgets all about the mice and rats that infest every slummo house in the L.A. area...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh were to start on this steamer? How about acting, it's bad. It's no surprise either since the acting is always bad in these POV "documentary horror" films. There is a small attempt at character development at the beginning of the film, but once the bodies start piling up it's basically nothing but screaming for an hour.The story is so ridiculous, even more than most current horror films. News reporter goes to apartment with fire fighters, crazy lady kills cop, other cop doesn't kill crazy lady...huh? This movie has the problem that most new horror movies have and that's they make everyone extremely stupid. People pretty much forget about the diseased murderers in the next room, get killed, and turn into diseased murderers themselves. And what was up with the end, everything was calm for the most part and then there's infected lunatics everywhere. *Yawn* Could it get any worse? Yes. The directing.Do you like to go to haunted houses for Halloween? If you do you'll love this movie, because that's all it is. There is no story, no real plot, just a bunch of things jumping out of shadows to make you jump. Well done Mr. Director, well done. Unfortunately we are left without the token "cat-jumps-out-from-area-that's-being-inspected" scene. There are no lights in this apartment complex, it seems as though the light bulbs also caught a disease that killed them.If you enjoy overacting, horrible stories, bad directing, completely predictable scenarios and rip off endings, then you must be a redneck...oh wait, I meant, then you will love this movie. Seriously, the ending completely ripped off Blair Witch Project, the only difference is that the camera sees the monster that is going to kill them. Save your money and go to a fun-house, or go on a roller coaster ride, it'd be better than this crud...which, and I'm not surprised, is a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful but ordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie when I saw the trailer and felt that the movie delivered what it intended to.The movie itself takes place from the point of view from a cameraman named Scott. The cameraman is shooting a take on what firemen go through on an ordinary day when their ordinary day turns into extraordinary. They get a call to an apartment complex and get locked inside with what appear to be zombie like creatures.It is a movie that I would place in between the 28 days/weeks movies and Cloverfield. It has suspense (will be great on DVD w/surround sound in the future) but some of the characters lack common sense. The fact that the movie is shot from one camera had some people disappointed since it didn't involve too much of a story as to what is being "quarantined", but that is to be expected.I would say that the movie could have been a heck of a lot better with a solid story and a bigger climax/plot. It is worth your time to watch, but if you don't like shaky cameras like Cloverfield and Blairwitch Project, then I wouldn't watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to those with intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately I could not give the film a minus score - it deserves minus 10 - it is not worth watching.The main presumption in the movie is that all those who lived in the apartments were completely stupid and so were tho police and firemen who came to help them. The fact that there was a vet in the apartment block who did not spot rabies until 30 plus minutes after I did points to the totally unrealistic plot and the ignorance of the director who wrote it. It was obvious from the moment the first woman the paramedics saw was foaming at the mouth. That was an immediate warning to quarantine the building, not group everybody together. The police would not have approached but used a taser gun to immobilise her before sedating and securing her. Then we had the doctors wearing bio-hazard suits. They would have only gone inside in force and to take sedated patients out into secure quarantine cubicles. They knew it was rabies and would have isolated all the individuals. Any further search of the building would be with high powered guns.We all know that the people in Hollywood are not the brightest or smartest of men/women, and this film goes to prove it. In my view the most important factor in a good film is the plot and if this is totally ludicrous and unrealistic the whole tenet of the film fails. It insults anyone with intelligence and obviously you cannot connect with any character in a film where they are all completely stupid.Obviously it is aimed at those with a low IQ.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously I'm sick of this genre of movies. Shaky videos found in the aftermath of a horrible situation...enough already. This probably won't be the best review you read for this movie, but for an avid horror movie enthusiast watching with eyes wide open...this movie was just...bad.Simple plot summary. A reality show that features late night careers is showcasing a fire station. They eventually get a call to a complex with an undisclosed issue. When they enter they encounter a strange old women standing there with blood and spit hanging from her mouth and she's growling. Now for the plot...get together a group of people with absolutely no survival or social skills who all happen to be mentally handicapped. Next lock them all into a complex with each other. Mix in a very unintimidating zombie wannabe virus and let them all run around with their arms flailing about. That's this movie.I'm sorry, but this movie was just...stupid and ridiculous. The story is actually really good (I hear it is based of some other movie that I've never watched, but whatever) and could have been executed soooo much better. The acting wasn't really bad, just completely without direction. The gore was there, but the camera was so damn shaky you could never focus on any of the action. The way the people reacted and the ending was just so pathetic it's unbelievable.-SPOILER- Really, if I'm trapped in a complex with some weird virus that turns people into violent monsters...I would not gather together in a lobby. I would gather the uninfected and secure myself behind one of the very thick well locked doors that the complex offers and wait it out. I would definitely not: Try and gather the infected into my arms, put my head near the infected persons face, lock myself in a room with the infected, run after the infected when they go crazy, eat someone, and take off. These people basically offer themselves up on a platter in this movie and it's just pathetic to watch. The end of the movie is so sudden that the audience actually groaned and stomped out of the theater.DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE, it is an OK rent or download but to pay $10 to see it is ridiculous. This movie is more of a 2 but I'm voting a 1 to help offset the idiots who vote this a 8+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, it was a pretty good movie. It entertained me, and it had zombie-like people (well, it was actually a virus, like in 28 days/weeks later- but still, that concept of zombies is always awesome). The camera was pretty shaky at times, which was a bit much, and at the end, Jennifer Carpenter, as hot as she is, got pretty annoying with the screams, crying, and hyperventilating. Kind of wish she would have shut up near the end.Pretty good jumps, some decent little gore parts- so overall, not a bad movie. I would probably buy it on DVD. Obviously no movie is perfect, and everyone will have their own views, likes, and dislikes. If you look at all the other past horror movies, this one isn't too shabby. Look, a movie entertains you, then it did it's job. That's why it's called "entertainment." Just because some jackass on the street says it sucks, and just because it didn't get many "stars," doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Plenty of "bad movies" have entertained the hell out of me- in turn, making them good movies- to me, at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You need to see the original "REC" movie to know how bad this one is. It tries to introduce more zombie attacks than the original making it way boring. And it is a failure in its end.1) To scare people you need to introduce pauses so there is thriller. In this movie they put too many zombie attacks compared to the original. It was much more explicit than REC so it becomes more a gore funny film than a horror movie.2) You can't choose such a bad actress, she screams so much you quickly want her to be caught by a zombie. What a bad performance.3) This is a Hollywood movie, it is supposed there is more resources, how can the zombies look so fake? the Spanish one was utterly superior. SPOILER The final monster is a joke compared to the original one. Incredible. The original monster was a girl and you could see her breasts, Hollywood censored this??? how funny. What about the night vision scene???? It didn't look like night vision at all!!!! It has to look like a negative or something, not like a dark version of a normal vision!!!3)They skip the most important thing here!!! In the final scene, they turn on the tape and NO EXPLANATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON IS HEARD! In the original movie you can hear the guy living in the flat talking about how he kidnapped the girl from a church where they kept her in Portugal, about his experiments and how he tried to cure her. It's several recording sessions and you see how desperate he gets because he can't heal her and he thinks he won't be able to keep her UP THERE for much longer. You can figure out he has been a victim of her.So the devilish nuance is lost in favor of the less scaring virus point of view. What made REC so good is that in the end it seems the girl ("Ni?a Medeiros") is some creature from hell it's not only about an infection.All in all, another Hollywood waste of money, instead of welcoming foreign movies they copy them and make them a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does this need to be transposed to LA?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK this is not a bad film. It really isn't, it's actually very average compared to the other awful zombie fare coming from the US in recent years. It really can't be that bad can it? It's a pretty much shot for shot remake of a great film. And herein lies the problem...Why would anyone watch, pay money for or endorse a film which is a shot for shot remake of another, much better, film? How would anyone make money out of this from a distribution standpoint? The answer sadly is because we are lazy lazy people who can't relate to anything outside of our incredibly small geography or sphere of influence. If an audience is called to watch subtitles to see a great film like REC, you have people lining up to remake it without. Because they know that a quick and effortless buck can be made off the joe shmoe's who can't be bothered or who don't have the mental capacity to both read a subtitle and keep track of images at the same time. Never mind that what they are seeing is a poor second place, at least its good ole American actors damnit! This extends further, it can't even be set in Madrid! Like the office couldn't be set in England, no this must be in LA, with second rate actors, mediocre translations of the original script and contrived camera work in place of the clever devices and aesthetics which created REC; one of the most atmospheric and genuine horror films of recent years.This viewing malaise cannot relate to a film outside of its own time even. Think Gus Van Sant, think the remake of Psycho, think why the hell did he remake a film shot for shot with Vince Vaughn instead of Anthony Perkins. Because its in colour, that's why and it's set in the present and otherwise how could any of these poor saps be expected to follow it.This is at least better than the truly blasphemous remakes of The Ring and The Grudge, perhaps due to the lack of gap here between US and Japanese cinematography, but there is still this deeper issue in US cinema. The fact that any film without a US passport and contemporary time stamp has to be remade. Or not even has to be but CAN be... and can make money to boot. This is a terrible state of affairs which serves no purpose than to further remove any artistic intent from film in the effort to dumb down content for a quick buck. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, The Hills Have Eyes, The Hitcher, Haloweeen, REC, The Grudge, The Ring, The Eye, Psycho... RIP, good films all! I expect the Mona Lisa to be repainted as a god damn cheerleader any day now...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the WORST movie I have ever seen. It was boring, and very poorly acted. It was more funny than anything. Also, it was very confussing. The camera is flying all over the place, so you can't really see what's going on. Then, a dog, that was suppose to be at a vet, randomly appears out of no where. The best part is a little infected girl, and the way she starts attacking. The whole threater cracked up laughing because it was so ridiculous. Another thing is that you lose interest 15 minutes into the movie when the main character stands outside the firehouse, doing nothing. Plus you already know the very predictable ending if you watch the trailer or even look at the movie poster. Absolutely awful, and I suggest no one waste their time ever watching this horrific movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found myself frustrated because the camera moved way too much. It started off okay but then the camera moved so much that it was frustrating to anyone who was watching it. The remarks by everyone in the theater made that real clear. I am a private investigator and would loose my clients if I ever let my camera take that type of film. My film has never looked that bad, even when running, crawling or driving. A qualified cameraperson would have never moved the camera that much. It was impossible to see what was really going on in the movie and who was who during most of the time. Whenever a person was observed who had the rabies could not really be seen. The only thing the movie showed was people standing, running or sitting with foam running down their mouth It made me feel sick, frustrated and difficult to enjoy the movie. I was disappointed and would not refer anyone to see this movie.</fullReview>

Once inside a building, the entire place is placed on knockdown. Then you're subjected to an hour of repetitive boredom. Nine people walked out of the theater, and now I wish I had done the same.

I'm guessing the writer saw Rabid as a youth then years later 12 Monkeys and 28 Days Later. Sadly, all of those movies were vastly superior and yes I'm including Rabid. By the end of the movie I was thinking, "I've never seen a movie entirely populated by the expendable imbecile character who sticks his/her head into the air duct to see what's making the strange noises after having already lost half the cast... well at least that's a novel concept!"The premise was way out there but could have worked. The camera work was a little too much trying to out-handycam "Cloverfield" but at least that partially hides the idiotic way our "heroes" handle their situation. The ending had me oddly thinking of sending the premise to Myth Busters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent remake, but Rec better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angela Vidal and her cameraman are making a documentary about the fire brigade. Joining up with a couple of them, called out to an apartment building, they soon discover something horrific is going on....Quarantine is a an American remake of Rec. This means it has two major problems to overcome. First, Rec was to me the scariest movie I've seen in a cinema for almost 18 years (the last, was The Exorcist III)! The second, is that it IS an American horror movie remake. Now, the track record for this has been awful. Consider the evidence - The Ring, The Grudge, One Missed Call, The Wicker Man to name some. Hell, they can't even remake American movies! The Hitcher, When A Stranger Calls (I still shudder about that one!), Prom Night, Halloween. So this movie starts with two major points against it.However, despite a couple of minor issues, and one major one, it's not that bad.The reason it works, is that the director John Erick Dowdle has taken the scares from the original and simply re-done them. In fact the movie is almost a shot for shot remake of Rec! The fact that despite having seen Rec, the scares still work is a testament to not only how scary the original was, but also how well they've been re-done.As I said, there are a couple of minor faults. Some of the make-up effects, don't quite work. The other minor fault is that the cast, while good aren't as convincing as the original cast were. Case in point, Jennifer Carpenter as Angela. At the start she's fine, but by the end she's a bit over the top in hysterical and terrified mode compared to Manuela Velasco.But the major fault, and this one is harder to overlook is that they've changed what is actually going on. In this movie, it's suggested that it's a strand of rabies that has caused the outbreak. In the original, it's never really revealed what is causing it, although events towards the end suggest a possible supernatural cause. But because they've changed it here, it means the final scenes don't work as well, and don't really fit. And the final shot, which was revealed in the trailer by the way, again doesn't work in the remake.The movie is slightly longer than the original, spending more time with the fireman at the station before the events begin, and has a little more emphasis on what is going on outside also, but these little changes don't affect the movie that much.How you view this movie will depend on the original, Rec. If you've not seen the original then it is a pretty effective scary movie, especially the last 15 minutes. However if you've seen Rec, then this movie offers nothing new, and isn't as good overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More human eyeballs infected with this turkey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terribly repetitive, boring, and irritating horror pic. Shot -- again! -- in the horrible hand-held style of "Cloverfield" and "The Blair Witch Project", it boasts a couple of jumps and dozens of jerky scuffles in the half dark that add up to a numbing experience. A literal remake of "Rec", a film I wasn't too fond of, it is all told from the viewpoint of a cameraman and a reporter (Jennifer Carpenter) who are shadowing some firemen for the night. When they enter a building where something resembling rabies has broken out, the so-called "horror" begins. I say so-called because there is nothing scary here. It's just noise and chaos. My first big problem with this remake was Carpenter's reporter character -- she's arrogant, smug, annoying, loud, and unprofessional. She's not a reporter's backside. I spent the whole movie wanting her to die. The hand-held, doco-style horror film has got to be buried. It has become such a cliché. When the filmmakers of "Man Bites Dog" employed it, it was effective. The hand-held material was also realistically shot. The professional news cameraman who is shooting this turkey would be pink slipped the moment the network copped a look at his footage. Why do filmmakers think that hand-held footage needs to look like a drunk is filming it? Empty horror movies made by and for ADD-ridden idiots are slowly driving me away from modern horror films. "Quarantine" should be quarantined for good so it can't infect another human eyeball.</fullReview>

My friends and I all agreed at the end that it stunk. The only good part was when the last girl (the reporter) was finally dragged away. I never even knew this was a remake, but maybe they should've stuck with the original and left the USA outta it. Bottomline, I wish I never saw it, it's too drawn out, I mean come on, the beginning before the actual call seemed to take forever. It was like GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!

		<fullReview>A television reporter and her cameraman occupying to spend themselves the night shift in a fire station. After a routine call take them to an apartments building. There they meet residents,cops, caretaker already in the scenario ; all of them are trapped inside a building quarantined by the CDC after the outbreak of a mysterious virus which becomes humans into bloodthirsty murderers . Acceptable remake full of eerie scenes with zombies and creepy scenes .This following packs a sinister and horrifying atmosphere by means of shaky camera and videotape as well as the former Spanish films titled REC 1, and 2 . The eerie tale deals with a reporter (Jennifer Carpenter )who leads a TV team inside the quarantined building , in which communication means have been cut-off and police agents are not relaying information to those closed inside. They soon learn that a woman living in the building has been infected by something unknown and after that are attacked by the zombie-like creatures . The journalist , a fireman (Jay Hernandez) and his cameraman occupying to spend themselves the night against the zombies . There , they find residents already in the scenario have been possessed by strange demoniac forces . After that , the tenants and inhabitants are brutally attacked by psycho people ; they soon learn that people living in the building has been infected by something unknown. The group attempts the getaway but they only encounter that have been sealed off and try to avoid the bloody attacks .This sequel to one of the highest earning horror movies of the last years titled ¨Rec¨ is realized in similar premise to original and contains a good cast as Jennifer Carpenter, Jay Hernandez , Johnathon Schaech ,Steve Harris and Rade Serbedzija. It's a solid movie , a terror story plenty of suspense, restless horror, and in documentary style. Film itself takes place from point of sight from cameraman. The flesh-eating zombies appearance deliver the goods plenty of screams, shocks and tension .The horror moments are compactly made and fast moving . It packs tension, shocks, thrills,chills and lots of gore and blood , but the original is far superior . Well worth seeing if you like shaky cameras, such us ¨Blair witch project¨, ¨28 Days/Weeks¨ and ¨Cloverfield¨ . Dark cinematography filmed in Downtown, Los Angeles, California, Hollywood, Los Angeles, and Sony Pictures Studios by Ken Seng .The picture produced by Julio Fernandez (Filmax Productions) is professionally directed by John Erik Dowdle but with no originality and based on the Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza film, two magnificent experts on terror genre . Both of whom are directing the third part (in pre-production) titled ¨Rec, Genesis¨ with similar crew and actors . Furthermore another filmed titled ¨Quarantine : the terminal¨ by John Pogue. Rating : 5,5 , passable follow-up that will appeal to horror fans .</fullReview>

There is very little if any foreshadowing, and the whole movie went by so fast you could barely understand what was going on, and with the camera shaking constantly, it was hard to tell what was really going on.This could have been a good movie, if more effort was put into it, and maybe a little less dramatic. Between the main characters screaming and hyperventilating and the shaky camera, it gave me a headache.Basically? If you feel the need to see it, rent it, or borrow it from someone who, like me, was stupid enough to buy it based on the cover. Its not worth the money.</fullReview>

It's that distress call that Jennifer Carpenter and Steve Harris are answering. When they get in there, they can't get out and neither can any of the residents. They've been quarantined by the CDC.Louis Pasteur would not have known what to do here. Instead of incubating for months, symptoms develop within minutes upon contact. Imagine dogs going mad, and humans turning into mad dogs. It's all one bloody mess and all filmed in the first person with Steve Harris's camera.In the cast is one of my favorite young actors, Jay Hernandez who I hoped would be getting better stuff than this by now. He was in both Hostel movies and came to a grisly end in the second. I do so hope he gets some better parts.Who knows what things people are cooking up in their homes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep yourself quarantined from this flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We haven't had a memorable United States-produced horror movie this year. I'll review the repertoire of 2008 horror for you. The year began with One Missed Call which is on track to becoming Rotten Tomatoes' poorest reviewed film of 2008. It was quickly followed by Prom Night, a terrible remake of a mediocre film. Then The Ruins, a derivative rehash of Neil Marshall's The Descent, entered cinemas. Summer brought George Romero's Diary of the Dead, which many consider superfluous, and The Strangers. The latter is an excellent example of a horror film attempting to frighten its audience but failing due to the director's inexperience. Recently Saw V and this film Quarantine hit theaters to capitalize on Halloween's looming presence.I'll admit I was very surprised that Quarantine opened in second place and received a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes (meaning at least 60% of critics recommended it). It is a remake of Spanish film REC. Don't get too excited, I know you're giddy with another remake of a successful foreign film. This one, however, isn't as poor as its contemporaries but it's nothing impressive.Unfortunately, plot isn't of central importance here. The entire film can be summarized in a single paragraph. For those concerned, Quarantine follows late night television report, Angela Vidal, and her cameraman Scott during an interview with local firefighters. They are preparing to leave when the firefighters are called to duty at some apartment. Angela and Scott follow them. When they arrive, the doors are locked. What happens after then is irrelevant, honestly. People die, blood squirts, and Angela begins screaming constantly. In this entrant, victims contract a rabies-like virus which turns them into zombies. It also features a jerky camera and poor lightening, rending it impossible to see what is happening and even more difficult to care.It is unfortunate that a film such as this one is recommended solely because it isn't completely terrible. Quarantine does provide the occasional "boo" moment, but it never creates tension in the intended way. This film is frightening because its camcorder production value comes packaged with uncertainty. In The Blair Witch Project and early Mondo films, this style was fresher and more effective. Its shock value has diminished by now, which will force movies to create their own scares. This is where Quarantine fails to capitalize. If you removed Scott, then this would be another disease movie.A real problem arises when one considers the film's basic plot. Why did was the apartment complex locked as soon as the firefighters arrived? Assuming the police wished to prevent the illness from spreading, why expose more people to it? How can Scott bludgeon a zombie with a camera and not damage it (this actually occurs)? I don't know either, and the movie makes no effort to explain any of these problems to us. We barely have any knowledge of the illness itself.After I watched Quarantine, I watched the original version REC, which was released last year. I wasn't impressed by it much either, but I did find it more frightening. In that film, we are never given a view of the outside, but the remake contains many shots of the outdoors. When you realize that this disease is contained and under control, how can you expect to be frightened? Imagine if police had surrounded Laurie Strode's home and allowed Michael Meyers to pursue her until he surrendered. Would you be terrified while watching it? If you must see a horror movie this year, then I suggest you stay at home. Nothing in cinemas now (in wide release) is even remotely frightening. Of what we've seen this year some are grotesque, some are unnecessary, and some are incompetent. Quarantine fits into two of those characterizations. Final Consensus: ** out of *****</fullReview>

By the way, even the night vision was horrible) and the shaky shots, this is a definite time and money waster. It was more annoying than anything, totally hard to get into; I couldn't even see what was going on half the time. Makes me wonder if they're trying to hide poor special effects? How hard is it to stay focused and on one scene while standing still?!?! And what's with the zooming in and out, focusing on nothing in particular. This guy is supposed to be a "semi-pro" cameraman for his company, right? Over the top acting, mixed with a somewhat poor script. The second half of the movie was easy...screaming and freaking out with the occasional attack and attempt to calm the crazy lady down. The 15 minutes spent in the opening scenes in the firehouse seemed to be more of a time filler than an introduction into anything. Why was the old woman the first to show signs of the infection? And not the little girl or her parents, to whom Max belonged? They could have opened with possibly showing the different people Max interacted with, them bringing him to the vet; or at the building where they film an interview with one of the tenants or door to door with some kind of "mission" when they hear the scream and are the ones to call maybe? at least there would be some action other than her flirting with the men. Originally I was thinking 1 star, but changed my mind when I thought about the potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Story, No Characters, No Scare (Very Slim Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Already in the Quarntine commercials, they've put the last 5 seconds of the ending and the most scariest part of the film, so I already knew this wasn't going to be good. And yes, I've already seen REC (The Spanish original) I watched Quarntine anyways, for I hope Americans can actually pull of a good remake one day, and nope, it hasn't been done with this film.There are 3 main disappointments in this film, excluding the fact that it was a poor remake.1. No story- what I hated most is that they completely took out the story on the whole situation. It is at the end when they are suppose to realize what was happening to them, but they just ignored it. Therefore, the movie ends without knowing what caused the infection and what was in the final room, especially for those who have not seen the original.2. No characters- One of the strongest factors of REC was their ability to let the viewers know each and every one of the people in the building. You knew their names, their family, their basic backgrounds and personality, and you knew the ones end up infected. In Quarntine, you wouldn't know who is who, who just fell down the stairs, and the only names I remember are the reporter, cameraman, and the little girl.3. No Scare- Throughout the whole movie, i did not once jump or get even the slightest scare. Mainly I know the story before I watched, but Quarntine changed it up quite a bit in scare tactics, but it still didn't work. They also decide to have it extra dark throughout the movie, yet in REC, the rooms were lite and the atmosphere was still scary.Even knowing the whole story, Quarntine left me confused in many parts; the camera was everywhere. I would of liked it if they included an Asian family as they did in REC; no idea why excluded this race. Since I've ranted about all its negative, the only thing i find positive in the film is the better make up artists than REC.I believe no one should pay to see this movie and watching the original (REC) is worth it. But if you're too stubborn to not watch a foreign film with subtitles, then by all means stick with this scare-less, story-less, and character-less movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed in this movie to say the least. Without giving too much of the story away for those who might actually want to see it (if you even want to say that there is a story), I would compare this movie to watching a cold pot of water boil away. It starts off slow, and once you see the first bubble, you pretty much have seen it all. Once you've seen Miss Espinoza, you've seen all the characters. Quarantines story line is about as repetitive and increasingly intense as the boiling of the water. Again, once you've seen the first bubble, you've seen them all, it just builds up speed until there's nothing left, literally. What happens to the previously mentioned Miss Espinoza happens to everyone. And the kicker is that they even mention this half way through the movie when the reporter mentions that no one will make it out of building alive. That's the first time I've ever actually seen a movie where they so blatantly gave away the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, am I the only person that hated this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was privileged to obtain a private screening of Quarantine 3 days before it came out and I didn't think that it was worth it. The first 20 minutes or so, you're wondering why they stretched this out so much. Jennifer Carpenter is a great actress, but in this movie, she blew it. By an hour into the movie, I wanted Jay Hernandez to take the ax to her head and just get her out the picture. She screams so much throughout the movie..you kind of want to say, "Shut up!" When I discovered that the disease is sorta-kinda like super rabies, I killed myself laughing. I'm sitting here just wondering what in the hell was going on in Hollywood while they made this movie. The shaky camera aspect didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I know a lot of people asked for refunds due to the fact because they didn't know. Kinda wondering how you didn't capture that in the previews.I think I'm the only person who notices that they focus on the cameraman's Aasics during the ENTIRE movie. I give the Aasics their own props, they're clean even after he steps on the rat and you're pretty sure that when he beats the 'zombie' to death that it fell near his shoe. Way to promote the Aasics Hollywood! Towards the end, when they switch to NightVision, you knew that she's gonna go. You're waiting and waiting..and waiting some more because at this point, you're wanting her to die. And this is where the worst part is..they put the damn ending in the previews. What were they thinking!? I was pretty upset at that. They couldn't let the damn cameraman live?? I mean, you know no one is getting out alive anyway, but you didn't expect them to kill the main two characters in the last 2 minutes of the movie.It's a hit or miss movie. You either like it or not and I'm not the type of person to tell you to not waste your money on it.I give it props because it's more comedic than scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seen any crappy movies lately? No? If you want to, Quarantine is the movie for you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this film, i had very low expectations, and i'm surprised to say that i set my expectations much too high. Quarantine is not the worst film that I have seen. Nor the worst horror film that I have seen. But it is awfully close.The film is shot entirely in first person form. Similar to the fantastic Blair Witch Project, and the less than average Cloverfield. But it is not done well, by the time the action begins, the film style is no longer believable or entertaining. It is nauseating. The reason that the Blair Witch Project's photography worked was, it felt like you could actually be watching something that really happened. In the case of Quarantine it just felt fake. Which also has to do with the laughably melodramatic acting and the lousy special effects. Not to mention the stereotypical incompetence of law enforcement characters, and your average horror movie arguments, ie. "...You Cant control me!" or "...Oh my god, we're all going to die!" and the one line heard in almost every zombie genre film "...she's been bitten, we have to kill her..." The most disappointing part of the entire film was that I already saw the ending. Thats right! And if you have seen the trailer you have too! The very last shot of the film is also the very last shot of the trailer! Are you serious? Really? But the awful acting aside and the crumby special effects as well, the film was a bad story, badly told. the film explains very little about why the events taking place are taking place and what caused them. I'll tell you what the zombies are affected with. You want to know? yeah? Rabies. No lie. F-wording, rabies. That is probably the most original thing about this movie. That the affected parties only needed to go to the vet for their semi-annual check up. Ugh. But No explanation why the rabies virus is the way it is.There are genre films that have made use of the zombie viruses' anonymity, and it worked. It did not work for me. Nor the people I shared my film going experience with. When the credits rolled and the lights went up, a simultaneous groan could be heard from every row in the theater.Another thing that bothered me about this film was the lack of gore and the over usage of little noises and quick camera pans that are used for shock value. None of which are shocking enough or will stand out as innovative, original or entertaining. A zombie film needs to have more blood and guts than crappy duologue. Although most of the time the two can go hand in hand. Although, there was 1 scene and 1 scene only that put some blood on the screen...when the character filming the whole thing kills a rabies affected zombie with the lens of his news camera. Thats right! A glass lens is now a more effective weapon than a machete! Do the filmmakers really expect anyone to buy that scene? Really? Doesn't the general public understand how hard you have to hit someone with your fist to crush their skull or even hemorrhage the brain? Harder than you could hit something with a camera lens without so much as a scratch. Which there were none. nor fractures cracks dings, nothing. i've scratched a lens with my fingernail before. this super lens broke teeth out of the zombies skull. Would the D.P. please e-mail me and tell me where I can Get one of these things?If you want this film to do anything for you besides waste 90 or so minutes of your time, it wont. I absolutely discourage anyone who is of age to see this rotten example of cinema. And can only wonder, when will someone step up and make a good horror film again. This is not one by any stretch of the imagination, and I want my 90 or so minutes back. With interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILER ALERT*** The story line was quite interesting and would make for a great horror tale. That being said. . .This is one of the worst films I've seen. The cinematography is some of the worst I've ever seen.It was as if the camera man went way, way, way out of his way to make as many wild, fast, and jerky camera moves as he could. I've seen clips on youtube made by kids that are not as jerky and wild moving as this film. (At least on youtube, the compression codec introduces motion blur and smooths out the wild pans, trucks, and tilts and at least makes it watchable.) This is just unbelievable. A major motion picture that has no director of photography. They just wildly move the camera around.A major motion picture that has no lighting crew. Most of the film is in darkness (and along with the wild camera moves, makes it almost impossible to see anything.) Be sure and take your motion sickness pills before watching.It's just unbelievable that a major motion picture would have no focus puller as many of the shots were out-of-focus.If this film were submitted as a project for film school, it would receive a failing grade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awful and boring!I could watch REC (The original movie) million times. Even I know what happens in the movie, it doesn't lose a suspense. But the remake "Quarantine" is horrible. There is no suspense at all. AWFUL. The things I didn't like in this movie: (May contain spoiler) 1. The acting is awful, exaggerated. The whole acting is like a movie and not documentary. "Quarantine" can't give you a feeling of "reality" like REC gives you. 2. The camera is way too shaky. And almost all the time blurred. 3. The story is awful to compare to the original movie REC. In the original you can see at least what caused this accident in this building. By the way the building in REC is way scarier then in the "Quarantine".So don't waste your money for "Quarantine" and watch the original movie REC.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is based off the 2007 Spanish movie named "Rec". Quaratine is definitely a Hollywoodfied if you will version of the original. In "Rec" the camera work was not near as bad as Quaratine and the passion of the acting was MUCH better. Even with Jennifer Carpenter as the lead actress whom I believe is a great talent, especially for the horror/suspense genre, it is my opinion that this movie just wasn't written sufficiently to show her talent here. The end of the movie is where one can see the largest difference within the movie as well... overall Quaratine with its highly nauseating camera work and mediocre acting was a great disappointment. If the plot of this movie intrigues you I say stick with the original "Rec" as you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

But the tension started building up the moment the police with the reporters and firemen opened that door with the old lady. The characters played their roles well. It was expected that the characters would end up dying as the film progresses, but I did not expect the terrifying near-end and ending, which overshadows the horror of even the Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity.

		<fullReview>Good movie. I don't think character development is necessary for all films, just as long as I find something likable about the characters, and the lead actress was playful and 'professional' - for a reporter - which immediately gave her due credit, IMO.I don't mind hand-held camera movies (Blair Witch, Cloverfied, Chronicle) however I found this one extremely distracting and obfuscate, though realistic if we venture that direction. The acting was good. I liked the famous faces, Denis O'Hare and Greg Germann (from Ally McBeal).Jennifer Carpenter's performance was above average although her hysterical screaming and hyperventilating became annoying, though in a situation such as this I'd probably behave the same way.A bit dark. The camera man's light was insufficient to clarify specific details but then again, it's a movie and stayed true to the realistic nature - if you call a rabies rage outbreak realistic ha ha Watch it if you don't get sea sick. It's entertaining. I gave it a 6 to be nice, it's probably a 5, but whatever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In terms of plot Quarantine is like most recent horror movies - very simple and not all that imaginative. However for a movie like Quarantine the plot does not need to be very complicated nor does it need saw-like plot twists. Instead the simple plot leaves the viewer thinking more about what horror could be on the other side of the door, rather than focusing on minor plot-holes.Quarantine truly shines in its claustrophobic atmosphere, and watching the movie you will feel completely helpless. Small building, no help coming, lots of zombies. That is pretty much what the movie is made of.The story of the movie progresses as the characters are forced into new and darker rooms of the building, trying to outrun the zombies. In this particular movie, the infection outbreak is not very well explained, but it does not need to be, for the viewer to know what is at stake.If you are in doubt whether you should watch Quarantine or the Spanish original Rec, I would recommend Quarantine unless you are from Spain. I recommend Quarantine over Rec as a non-Spanish viewer, mostly because constantly reading the subtitles can easily mean you will miss some important details. Also i preferred the acting in Quarantine. I did however enjoy the more mutated zombies in Rec as they quite frankly just looked more out-of-the-ordinary than the ones in Quarantine. Quarantine also bring a couple of funny moments on the scene here and there. Luckily it is done in a very subtle way, and does not break the tension that this movie so horrifyingly provides through great acting, very convincing zombies and the fear of the unknown.I also wanted to mention that the main characters are very likable and not the stereotypical "brain of a bird" horror characters who goes alone into a sure death. However several of the secondary characters do occur as a bit annoying as some of them completely lack a sense of logic.Why should you watch this movie?You should definitely watch Quarantine if you are into Zombie flicks. Quarantine is somewhat different than the usual "Of The Dead" movies provided by George A. Romero, but it does not go to any far extends to alternate itself from the common zombie flick. If you are looking for a bloody and gory "torture porn" style of horror film, this is not it. This movie does not use jump-scares to frighten its audience either, so if you want a Paranormal Activity style of movie, you should rather be looking into something like Sinister or Grave Encounters.Helix horrible reviews</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the 2nd horror film I've ever seen from the year 2008 which has not sucked. This along with "Dance with the Dead" are the only good horror films so far that have been excellent from the year 2008. And I really loved this one, surprisingly been a bloody REMAKE! This is a remake of the 2007 Spanish horror film "REC" which I haven't seen yet, but I will.I won't go into the story because I'm sure since it's become a part-time modern classic, everyone should have seen it.The atmosphere of this film though is intense, creepy, scary and it will make you jump with fright! I think the actors did an excellent job at their roles, making their characters truly believable, and the locking up of an apartment where there is no escape is truly terrifying and hard to watch.Two other aspects which made the film strong was the shaky camera movement, and the dark-lit night vision. Camera movement made this film more intense while as the night vision gave off the finishing level of fear. Making the night vision parts conclude the film was a great way to finish, but damn I wanted the new reporter to survive! That's the one thing about the film that was sad, the fact that everyone dies!!!! Anyways, if you have seen other remakes/horror films similar to this like: Hills have Eyes, The Crazies, 28 Days and Weeks Later, you are bound to love this a lot.A truly gripping film which is surprising because the year 2008 released tones of crappy, high tech shitty horror remakes and films and for a remake of a Spanish film, I was definitely amazed.8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the original titled "REC". It is superior in every way!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't waste your time with this movie. You'd be better off watching the original which this one is a remake of, titled "REC". First, I'd like to say that I enjoy watching the originals then the remakes so I can compare the two. Often, the remakes are totally different and can range from not that bad to totally great. A good example is "The Departed"(excellent) which is a remake of "Infernal Affairs"(also excellent). So again, I made it a point to watch "REC" before "Quarantine". Well, let me tell you that there is no comparison. Where "REC" was full of suspense with superb acting, "Quarantine" is a total mess. The lighting is awful, the acting is average... at best. But the writing is what really got to me. Why would they change anything from the original, ESPECIALLY THE ENDING? "REC" explanation was totally unexpected (you REALLY don't see it coming) and the ending makes you ask for more (I guess the writers/director heard the fans because REC 2 came out. Can't wait to see it). Who ever wrote "Quarantine" just dumb the plot down. They thought that adding gore and having people scream none stop is somehow "suspense". "REC" is superior in the sense that, yes there is some blood (not gore), but the writers/director clearly went for building an atmosphere that goes from light and breezy to total chaos. Everything moves along at a very quick pace. After just 15 minutes, the action begins. With "Quarantine", it takes at least 35 minutes of nonsense (which felt like 2 hours, that's how bored I was) before the firefighters are finally dispatched to the building, followed by the reporter and her cameraman. Also in "REC", they manage to have character development which really impressed me. In "Quarantaine", everyone is pretty much interchangeable. And finally, you know when sometimes you watch a movie and you start talking to the screen and say things like "why don't they do this?". Well with "REC", I found myself doing that and seconds later, one of the characters says what I just said or does what I said they should do. I tell you, run and watch "REC", you will not regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quick-Fire Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood is on something of a loser with these quick-fire remakes of continental hits. If the filmmakers remain faithful to the original they are accused of simply recycling while losing the flavour/atmosphere/intensity, etc of the foreign film; if they try to stamp their own personality on the material they're accused of messing around with a perfectly good formula for the sake of it. Personally, I blame the audience: if you can't be bothered to watch a film because it has a couple of lines of dialogue at the bottom of the screen you're either going to miss out on most of the world's greatest films, or you're going to end up watching the US version, which, more often that not, has been made for totally different reasons to those that gave life to the original.I watched REC, the Spanish horror movie of which this is a remake, a couple of weeks ago, so it was still fairly fresh in my mind ? not least because it was a bloody good horror flick. Quarantine stays faithful to the original while adding a couple of scenes ? presumably to pad it out to a more respectable running time. The new scenes don't add much, but they don't really detract from the story either. The film ? like REC ? is slow to begin with, but slowly gathers a pace that grows increasingly relentless so that, by this film's climax I was as gripped by the plight of the handful of remaining survivors as I had been while watching the original.Some of the shots are practically identical to the original, but this film's biggest departure is in the way it dispenses with the explanation for the rampaging zombies provided by the Spanish film, substituting instead a mutant-rabies strand that, to be honest, is probably more believable than the idea the Spanish came up with. Strangely, the American's kept the 'virus' press clippings and tape recorder parts in the final scenes without using them to explain why the ghoulish freak was living in the cellar.If you don't want to read subtitles then watch this instead of the original ? it's almost as good but ? guess what ? it's not as original! The female reporter here is way more annoying than her Spanish counterpart (and not half as cute), and falls too quickly into the helpless female role, but other than that there's not a great deal to separate them?</fullReview>

If you ever want to write again, and yes I believe this goes for movies as well, you need to abide by this one basic rule!This movie was alright for what it was (horror/thriller). It even made me jump a couple of times, and that doesn't happen a lot as I find most movies in this genre quite typical and boring. The camera work was really effective in adding to the suspense. The acting was pretty good. I was prepared to give this movie an 8, but when the lead character dies at the end... You're lucky to get the 4 I'm giving you!

		<fullReview>The only thing scary about Quarantine is how bad it was. the front cover of the movie tells you everything that you need to know. This is definitely a movie for those that dislike horror movies. There was no mystery, with every next move completely predictable. This is a horror for those that do not like to be scared. However, I applaud the use of first person camera shooting, it was creative as applied to the situation. Personally I believe that this is a case of poor directing. I simply was not scared. That is all I ask from this movie. Is that too much to ask? The attempt to blame the outbreak on rabies, was quite limp. I felt like the story was a mishmash of events strung together on a rather weak plot. Definitely NOT a must-see. By the way, to the proponents of this movie, an example of a good horror movie would be "The Shining".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I don't know if Im the only one who can't stand having seen an entire movie through having seen the trailer before hand, but lately things have gotten to a whole new level. Now they are showing the final scene of a film in the trailer (they did it with the Grudge 2 as well), and on the movie's poster??? I went to go see this with out too much of a build-up, and got about 20 minutes into the film when I thought to myself, "man I hope that scene in the trailer where she gets dragged away isn't right at the end of the movie, cause that would be a huge cop-out'. Of course it was, and the whole movie predictably led up to it, knowing that no one was getting out alive and that she was going to be the final survivor.Aside from that massive marketing cop-out or 'cheating the audience out of an ending they haven't seen already on TV', the movie was alright. Nothing groundbreaking (Cloverfield was far superior in intensity and use of 1st person POV) or original. I thought it was very predictable, but had a few cool sequences, but all of them seemed to come right in the final act. The acting was decent, the FX were easily overlooked because of the lighting and camera trickery which is a great way to stretch a budget for a film like this. Id wait to rent it, it won't suffer on a smaller screen and might even benefit in its intensity minus a large audience. Im sure plenty of people will like the scares, but I found them few and far between. Haven't seen the original, but for it to warrant a remake, Im sure its superior, shot for shot, or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with a buddy and my dad last Sunday...none of us came out happy. I went in with low-to-mid expectations (mostly because I never go in to a movie with high expectations for obvious reasons). I watched the trailer, saw some early reviews (from both critics and regular movie-goers), and figured why not? It looks like it could be decent. Well I was dead wrong. First off, it reminded me of Cloverfield in several aspects; the camera work, the fast-pace, and the running time. To me Cloverfield was a fun and thrilling ride and was more enjoyable because the setting and scenes were constantly new because they had to run around the city and the camera work didn't bother me at all. This movie was different. It relied too much on gore and already used scare tactics (that didn't even work) and the whole movie (other than the dull first 15 minutes at the fire station) was centered in a small apartment complex. Also, the most annoying aspect of this entire film is the camera work. Cloverfield's camera work was fine because people were fleeing the city as a large creature attacked the city and the camera did eventually calm down so you could see what was happening. In Quarantine the camera never stops shaking and is overly exaggerated and is even worse than Cloverfield's. Even when all the people are in a room and the mood is calm the camera is constantly zooming in and out and shaking...and this guy is supposed to be an experienced cameraman. While the movie never really "scares" you it does provide some adrenaline-pumping scenes (but for only a couple of minutes). In my book that's not enough to fulfill a viewer with the angst of wanting to keep viewing. The running time may have been only 90 minutes but it sure felt like 2 hrs. Even in the intense scenes where residents are being attacked (at one point during the film a good several are attacked at once) you can't even comprehend what is going on because the camera is barely showing it along with the shakiness. So, you wait for everything to calm down so you can look around and see who is no longer with them but you still can't tell...and new characters keep coming in so it's pretty much a huge mess there. And that's another thing. Not once does The movie allow you to connect with any of the characters (like Cloverfield did) so that when they were "attacked" you never really felt any pity or sorrow for their losses. I'm not trying to come across weird heartless freak in that point, just pointing out that it affects the viewer more when they are able to "like" a certain character. It just didn't give the viewers that opportunity. Also, by the end you can't wait until the movie is finished...as it adds ***spoiler*** an unnecessarily long final cut where the main character is crawling "blindly" in the direction of the fallen camera (which seriously took anywhere form 3-4 minutes to only be dragged away, and her annoying and abnormal heavy breathing sounds that are constant the last few scenes. Even the points when the movie tries to explain why this is all happening (a cult has unleashed an "extreme" form of rabies that started out in a dog who lived with residents at the apartment; that is still hardly explained and confusing and hard to figure out) ***spoiler*** So, overall I didn't enjoy (even with the fact that I'm a huge horror fan) or understand what was going on...yes I asked those around me but they had no answer...the supposedly suspenseful and horrifying scenes didn't give you chills (not even my buddy who is one of the most timid people I know...and people in the audience were even sometimes laughing during these scenes..yes laughing because they were sometimes just so ridiculous (***spoilers for example: a little girl suddenly attacks her mom and while everyone runs away the camera follows her actions and movements but she just didn't look scary (more crazy than anything) it was just hard not to laugh..it was pretty much watching a little 5 year old girl high on drugs and the scene where a little rat starts to run at the cameraman and he flips out and stomps on it and exclaims "It was charging right at me Did you see that? It was trying to attack me"*spoilers***, and the acting, plot, and camera work were all about the same in the fact that they were all shaky, horrible, annoying, and confusing at times. I give this film a 2/ 10 just for the reason that I don't believe it should be a 1...even though my friend and dad tell me it should be a 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe it or not , it is my favorite horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much from this movie I thought this would be a normal horror movie but I was wrong cause this movie just freaked me out.Before watching it I didn't even know about the original (REC)and after watching it I also watched REC but honestly I liked Quarantine much.For me,this is the most scary,nail biter and terrifying movie that's why it is my favorite horror movie(believe it or not).This movie really gives you an intense and high tension and I was in very much high tension and also scared during the movie.There's one more reason of liking this movie is that my favorite actress (Jennifer Carpenter) in it in a leading role but honestly her performance is really great.Her screams were great this also helped to make movie more intense.I was never been scared like this but when I watched this movie,I did.My heart was pounding loudly at the climax.All the settings were great to make the atmosphere according to the movie.So all I can say is that it was a really scary and intense ride and it will scare the hell out of you just like I did so if you ever get a chance to see this one then DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stay away from this horrible movie (and actors)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains spoiler !!!First; The only good thing about this movie is the ending, when one of the infected drags Angela (Jennifer Carpenter) away and finally makes her shut up. If our TV wasn't new (and expensive) I would've thrown things at it. My wife wanted see another movie after watching 10 minutes complaining on the horrible actors and Jennifer Carpenter specifically, I agreed with her but told her it actually got 6/10 so it can't be that bad. This is the first movie I've seen with Jennifer Carpenter and definitely the last, I will stay way clear of her (after looking it up I've actually have seen her in "White chicks" -a forgettable performance). I didn't read the reviews before we watched it and thought 6/10 couldn't be that bad, boy was I wrong. You could probably enjoy this movie if you can accept people doing illogical things all the time (like trying to cuddle Briana while she's drooling white stuff, completely forgetting that everyone else of the other infected attacks and bite you when they do like that), the list of stupid things the characters does goes on and on. Coping with Angela's (Jennifer Carpenter) screaming and retarded noises the last half hour is the worst part though. Did anyone giving this movie anything more than three stars actually see it before they gave their vote ?I ended up shouting at the TV that the cameraman should hit her (Angela) with the camera to make her shut up. In the end she finally shuts up, that was worth something (one star). Please read the other negative reviews because I can't honestly believe that anyone giving this horrible movie more than three stars actually have seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of scary movies and when I saw the previews for Quarantine I was bummed because I wasn't able to see it at the time. Two weeks ago I rented it out of the library without realizing what a dumb movie it was. I saw that it was a zombie movie and I have always been interested in zombies movies. However, this was like a butchered mixture of Resident Evil and Cloverfield. The camera was so shaky that you couldn't tell who was getting their head bit off, as this happens pretty much throughout the movie. I think if I saw someone with discolored skin and blood and drool hanging from their mouth, I don't think I would try to sweet talk it. That's what a majority of the characters do in this film, "Come here, we can help you" the next thing you know they are chewing on your neck. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie, if you want to watch a zombie flick, your better of watching Resident Evil or 28 Days/Weeks Later than wasting your time with a movie that tries so hard to scare you yet does not accomplish anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although there were some memorable moments, ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this.Carpenter's over-the-top hysteria throughout just about drove me crazy. Everyone else managed to maintain a degree of sanity, but this woman just snapped, and it was irritating when it kept up through the whole thing.I was also disappointed by the ending. I had no expectation of a concrete ending, or explanation of what happened, but what we DID get was unsatisfying. I felt a little cheated - I sat through many minutes of Carpenter's screaming for... what?I suppose this would make an OK rental (which is how we saw it) but it left us feeling vaguely annoyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a firm believer that in a movie where there is an ongoing threat that those being hunted have to at least have some chance of surviving. In this film they don't. Whatever those forces are out there, they don't understand them and they don't know what to do. The authorities know what is going on. Couldn't they have helped out. Maybe fry a few of these things or something. They seem to be a bit vulnerable. This is one of those films I thought would never end and when it did, I just thought, "So what!" Everyone acts in such a ridiculous manner. When people begin foaming at the mouth, perhaps that would be an indication to stay away from them. They don't and I don't care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it didn't have to be this bad - (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do we want out of horror movies? I don't know, but I want something a little more than this.The set-up for this film is pretty cool. A news crew traveling with a fire engine squad arrives at a building to investigate the piercing scream of an elderly woman. And then the woman appears to have some kind of sickness - she attacks a firefighter while foaming at the mouth.The nice twist is that everybody in the film is quarantined - sealed in the building. We spend the middle third of the movie getting to know all the neighbors. One of them is a vet, who explains that the symptoms look suspiciously like rabies.But the last third of the film is hampered seriously by just how abjectly stupid everybody acts. Even after we learn that some kind of virus has led to an infection that leads to maniacal aggression by those affected, the medical crews are remarkably casual when dealing with the infected. And even after this point of the film, when a little girl starts foaming at the mouth, a policeman unbelievably tries to comfort her and tell her she'll be all right - in spite of having seen four or five similarly infected people launch attacks.At this point, the viewer just stops caring. The shaky cam, first-person approach doesn't help any.Horror directors should learn that what makes a film scary is not the number of characters killed off, but how they are done in. Quarantine does so in a shaky-cam, absurd manner that leaves the viewer more dizzy than scared.And the very worst thing about the film is that its final scene was revealed in the trailer.It didn't have to be done this way. It could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>? Please don't waste your time ? Blair Witch Project- shaky hand-held cinematography is the only thing that will thrill you because you're trying not to get dizzy and throw up and pay attention at the same time. ?&nbsp;Without that effect, it's a pretty lame movie, I wish I had my hour of life back as I tried to fast forward through to the action. ?&nbsp;No substance, a fifteen year old could do a better film and post it on youtube ?&nbsp;To continue too many things don't make sense so add to the unreal quality of the movie that distinguishes it from a possibility into a poorly rehashed nightmare that you will wake up from and forget. There was a good freakout part of the movie about 1 hour in, but by then you're looking at your watch or like me fastforwarding to the end. I wish to boycott bad movies, but I am lured in by the pitch. I'm going to read the reviews before I waste another hour of my life, thanks Quarantine. I gave it a 1 because it doesn't deserve the average 6 it has. If the ratings have any meaning I'd give it a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minus Carpenter, it could have been better..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has some of the right elements to be a good horror film, if not too many cliché ones as well. Unfortunately, the few thrills are outweighed by the glaring faults. Characters with mallets and hand guns are easily devoured as our protagonists waltz in circles joyfully trying to film everyones demise, their ability to evade quite an impressive feat considering the television camera that constantly accompanies them.Furthermore, Jennifer Carpenter as a reporter is a joke, which really derails the entire "reality" format of the script. What real reporter would expect to televise from inside a mens locker room, or ask a fire chief how he keeps his legs from burning when he slides down the fire pole in a skirt? You get the feeling shes more of a giggly adolescent working for a closed-circuit high school news program than a professional, creating many eye rolling moments. Fortunately she's shadowed by the world's most indestructible camera manned by the world's most dedicated camera man, who thanks to the films gimmicky format refuses to drop his camera even as the odds become overwhelmingly against them. I get it guys, keep filming when police officers and firemen are there to stick it to the man and get the shot, but when it gets to the point it's just you and your reporter buddy against a legion of quasi-zombies, I think its time to drop the cam.Ultimately what it comes down to is Jennifer Carpenter inability to portray her characters descent into hysterical madness. Rather, it's almost like a light switch, where one moment she is calm and ambitious to witness every bit of gore possible, the next she's screaming uncontrollably and shaking to the point you think the camera man will actually have to slap her to get her to focus.By the end of the film the absurdity level reaches a max, with the screeching fem lead practically begging to be slaughtered as the camera man KEEPS FILMING as they run for their lives from everyone else who is now infected. Oh well, I do suppose that if for some reason the police and fire men couldn't outlast the Mean Girl and her buddy with the 30 pound camera they probably wouldn't be so tough to brush past post-disembowelment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoiler Warning** Although I did not really expect much before watching this remake, I would have to give this movie a 4 out of 10 at the most. I truly believe that there is no such thing as a "perfect" movie folks, but Quarantine is far from perfect if there ever was such a movie. The sole purpose of the introduction of the movie was to add a realistic feel and to allow for the audience to sympathize with the characters later on. This fails however due to the horrible acting which plagues the movie until the end. From the very beginning it is impossible to believe even for a second that the reporter is in fact a real reporter, and this is also the case for the firefighters. As the movie progressed I found that each of the characters were making unbelievably stupid decisions and that instead of being horrified, I found myself suffering from uncontrollable laughter in many parts during the film. However there were some aspects of Quarantine which stood out in a positive light. The people who were infected with the super strain of the rabies virus looked great at times, although I never really figured out why their teeth were so sharp after they had lost all sanity. The camera angles were not bad throughout the movie and obviously the point of view feature was also used to add realism to the movie. I did not really like the ending because I found it difficult to believe that a super strain of rabies could be created within the confines of an apartment complex. Also I was confused on why the bioterrorist madman's apartment room was so much larger than everyone else's. In the end Quarantine was really nothing but a bad remake. Nothing special. -Waffles</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is not much to say about this film. The concept was decent, the cast was good but the directing and cinematography were horrible. i literally got sick watching this film and had to turn it off. The shaky hand held camera got old after the first 10 minutes. If you are going to watch this make sure you have some Dramamine handy.Simply put, the decent premise was completely mishandled all the while, trying to emulate Cloverfield's filming style. Are there any saving graces in this film? Jay Hernandez (Hostel) was likable as a character but that's about it.Not worth the rental fee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you have your choice, choose to see Rec instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I do not feel this was a horrible movie in itself. It retained a lot of the nerve wracking tensity that the original Rec did, and had it not been a remake of a better movie, it may have fared better in my mind. Being an American myself I don't believe I really had an understanding of what "Americanizing" a movie meant until I watched this. I saw Rec prior to viewing Quarantine, and I am glad I did. Anyone who has an issue with subtitles, let me say that they do not take anything away from Rec. Quarantine on the other hand, had moments that made me feel as if I was being spoon fed the story, rather than simply taking it all in on my own. And while I have no qualms with sexual content in media, I felt that the addition to the 'sexual tension' in the early scenes of the movie were very unnecessary, had the film lived up to Rec, it would have sustained its audience without the added raunchy comments and swinging fireman cods.There were a few scenes also added in, I assume to help 'clarify' such as the scene where the television worked for a few minutes, explaining the lies the public was being fed about the building's inhabitants. Yes we get it, you see this frequently in this sort of movie. It really didn't need to be spelled out for us. Sometimes the imagination is far more powerful than what we actually see before us. Let your mind paint a picture of what is happening outside the building-hence the open window scene where one resident was shot once again not necessary. Rec never actually showed the outside of the building, which added to the claustrophobia you felt as you followed the characters to their demise. Also you never saw anyone 'changing' or in the early stages of infection. Yet again, more spelling out that we didn't need. Please for the love of god let us use our imaginations once in a while!In the original, Vidal showed disdain for her job filming the firehouse overnight. In my mind this added additional 'realism', she felt more like you or me, maybe bored with her mundane job. In Quarantine, her character seemed to go overboard with being 'bubbly'.The ending, while the sequences were similar, I don't believe Quarantine managed to live up to the creepy feeling of seeing all the religious newspaper clippings and excerpts hanging from the penthouse apartment walls. Or the story they told. Something was lost in the translation to a purely 'mad scientist' solution to the question of 'how'. As I originally stated, this movie wasn't 'terrible' but seeing as it was the translation of an original idea that was 'watered' down for a different audience, that is why I am only giving it a 4. I say why ruin a good thing? It's good as it was, and a few artistic liberties are forgivable, but you start ripping out the depth of the movie, adding in blatant explanations of things that don't need to be explained and shoving in sex where ever you can manage will bring it down quite a few notches, at least for me. Perhaps the proper word here is 'cheapens'.I'm sorry to say this by far did not live up Rec standards. I hope that anyone who watches this one will also find a copy of Rec and watch it as well, to get a better view of what happened in that apartment complex and an appreciation for being allowed to 'connect the dots' themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now i know why this film went straight to video. This movie was based on another title which was made to look real as it was filmed. What i really hated about it was when the camera guy kept going out of focus. Which made it really hard to concentrate on the movie. At least cloverfield when i saw it was spontaneous in every way. This movie was expecting the public to expect the unexpected. This was a sad move, if this film was made like 28 days later or weeks later it could have been more interesting in why the quarantine was needed. I actually was disappointed in this film, it was not very original except for the virus or whatever caused a person to try and eat another. And using the look real concept was not what the public needed, they needed to see a more impactive motion to make it more scary. And with not using music made it more less plausible. Like i said cloverfield was much more cause and effect, very original, and downright scary at most points. This did not move me.</fullReview>

I won't even go into details, but the situations that were obviously meant to be scary were just absurd. The ONLY part of the movie that had me even close to the edge of my seat was the ending, but even that was predictable and certainly nothing new. The camera thing gets really annoying very quickly. It reminds me of the movie "Cloverfield" in that respect. I gather that this film was a remake and that most people consider the original to be better. I can easily believe that it would be. Bottom line, if you have 2 hours to kill, give it a watch. It's really not very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting movie, but Jennifer Carpenter's acting spoiled it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first to all the JC fans, sorry but her hysterical screaming became extremely annoying. . and so very frustrating that we actually wanted her to get killed off asap. On that note, if anyone of the unfortunate souls should have survived to the very end, it should have been the fireman and the cameraman last. On one of JC's screaming sessions, we were begging her cameraman to Please Slap Her out of it. That being the biggest downfall is my reason for scoring this movie so low, perhaps with better acting on Jennifer's part, it would have been a much better movie. As for the Penthouse apartment, it would have been more interesting if there was more information, or prelude to the tenant, etc. I would have liked to have heard more speculation/conspiracy dialogue. More verbal interaction could have created more tension, suspicion, tenants turning on each other, etc. Once the chaos began, and the panic ensued, the pace quickened so fast the movie just turned into a regular slasher style of movie. So very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While a somewhat good movie it has it's share of faults.First off the 1st person view of the whole movie through a shaky camera has already become overused. The Blair Witch, Cloverfield, and Quarantine's predecessor REC ? But as if that were not bad enough, towards the end when the camera, after being used as a weapon a few times, finally starts to have it's light flicker on and off and then to night vision left me with an absolutely frustrated feeling and a partial headache. A shaky camera with a flickering light??? No epileptics please!Now on to the acting, or I should say the dialogue. I, for one, hope with every fiber of my being that if put in a crisis people would not suddenly turn into blithering idiots as they do in this flic. If you can think of a wrong thing to do, they do it with gusto. There are guns lying about yet the male protagonist chooses to wield a sledgehammer and no one else even mentions a firearm let alone grabs one!?!? 'Scuse me but crazed, bloodthirsty killers + available guns = bullet to the head. If they wanted to be creative and go for an unusual weapon such as the sledgehammer then leave the guns out of the equation altogether as any normal person would indeed choose a boomstick over a hammer.If you can FF to the last 5 minutes you may find a shiver or two dribbling down your spine. The "eye candy" role in this movie is played by Dania Ramirez, who is a minor supporting actor.For once I would like to see a movie that actually had people do what would benefit their survival instead of trying to get them selves killed. Example - a group of people put in a dire situation who use everything they have at their disposal yet more importantly use their heads to prolong their existence against the terror that hunts them. OK, OK so there is one person who breaks down and fills the blathering, ranting, unclear thinking and panic stricken screamer. But the rest, well the rest ignore this fool and TRY to survive, now that would be a refreshing change of pace.It's my humble opinion that this movie needs to be watched alone and in the dark to be enjoyable... let your imagination fill in what the movie leaves out for a good scare.</fullReview>

There are some humorous parts - some of them MEANT to be funny, others just so outright funny because there is nothing else to laugh at, and the director/s have tried just a little too hard.I don't normally write reviews unless I really love/hate something.

		<fullReview>once in a while there is a great a horror movie that gets bought by bad American producers and is made into a remake by some director, REC was an instant classic for me when I saw it, but still when I went and saw quarantine I tried to give it a shot since i liked miss carpenter in her previous horror movie The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Unhopefully, as soon as I saw the film, my doubts thats it would be a crappy remake were proved right even before the story left the fire station, First of all, Rec owed it's success to it's technical efficiency, acting, realism, jumps and storytelling all of which are not as good in the remakethe camera in quarantine pushes to far is just not as good, with more changes of focus(when movie camera's alway,s use wide-angle shots anyway so there is less of that) the format just gets distracting. As for the lighting, in quarantine it,s welcome to a B series film, it looks like TV drama lighting and that is just so unrealistic to the fake documentary approach it claims to haveAll the actors in quarantine have already been in mainstream film or television,(for Christ sake, Colombus Short playing the policeman was in stomp the yard, this is just ridiculous how are you suppose to believe a hunky dancing pretty boy to be a policeman) but as for acting they just don,t have the same charm as the actors in rec who are just super realistic and look like real people in front of the camera not like actors. Realism was key in REC and as i said before, the actors don,t look real, THEY ARE ALL to PRETTY, I have been to Barcelona and the people in rec look like anybody walking down the street . Quarantine is filled with known faces who have their spot in a sears catalog. Who are you gonna be identifying with, normal looking people with their flaws of a bunch of hunks and pretty girls.The lighting is off, and the actors are to pretty, Other then that, miss carpenter is OK but not as well directed as Manuela Velasco in the original. even the gore effects are not as realistic and fluidly introduced.The horror effect and the jumps are there put diluted, in fact the film is just not as scary, the ending looks a lot less terrifying and it looks fake, only the blood is goodthe jumps to me where of course not as good but i can,t be totally objective since i knew when they would come, but still the audiences reaction around me had nothing in common. all those point at which quarantine lack REC quality make it SO inferior and just plain badto resume, please if you really want a scare and a good time, see rec, This is horror for grown-ups, quarantine is the 14 year old friendly version. It just lacks the movie's essence, it's realism, it's nature and it's soul, it's just an empty spooky film with good intentions but who just comes up short. it can be entertaining but it's just not an extraordinary and scary film like the original, see quarantine if you wanna show your preteen sister a scary flick and you're afraid she will make nightmares for ages after seeing recDowdles of all ages, man-up and show some creativity, and if Americans or my fellow Canadians are too stupid to read subtitles(which I doubt) well to bad for them, make a translation of the film or simply don't do anything instead of a bad remake in Englishthanks for reading, have a great time at the movies Godspeed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Quarantine was one of the few horror movies made in the past few years where the plot was good (not just lets see how many people we can kill in 2 hours) and still gave a scare, not just a few laughs. The plot for this movie was very entertaining and fun to watch the only problem was the acting and choice of actors. The main character was obnoxious. For the first half of the movie she acts like a drunk freshman in high school and shes supposed to be a professional news anchor. The actors just didn't seem to fit their roles and their acting just didn't seem natural to me. For example the firefighters were all professional models and all noticeably make-upped. How often do you see that in a fire station. The little girl looked like one of those girls who are in child pageants which kinda bothered me. The movie was just made with too much Hollywood in it and by that i mean this was supposed to be just average everyday people and the actors just couldn't act like everyday people. I won't say completely avoid the movie. Its a great Halloween time scare but i would definitely recommend the original movie, Rec, over this one any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably worst horror of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A poorly written, poorly directed nonsense. The movie tries to achieve horror and realism at the same time. It cannot be done. A bunch of frustrated people yelling at each other. Thats real but ain't scary. The camera shakes all the time, that is real.A kid who was fine the entire movie then just turns into a "zombie" at the perfect moment and bites her mom's neck. Thats horror, not real. Both brain dead guys who were unconscious most of the movie, gets up and bites everybody around them just when nobody is looking, thats horror. This embarrassment of a movie goes back and forth like this throughout the film, pursuing realism at one point then horror immediately after.In the end, the realism annoys you, and the horror is illogical to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alone in the dark. Viewer included.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A news crew consisting of sexy anchor Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) and cameraman Scott Percival (Steve Harris) are on a routine report about the boys in yellow - the firemen. On site they hook up with a pair of muscle flexing machos, which includes Jake, a true American hero (Jake Hernandez).A routine call-in to an apartment house suddenly goes awry, when the inhabitants start attacking people at random and the whole building is blocked off by police and special forces. The film crew were just unlucky enough to be on the wrong side of the quarantine.The movie plays out like an almost zombie movie, with people being infected step by step. The virus that makes people bloodthirsty quickly decimates the tenors and the body count grows exponentially. That's apparently what's happening, but don't take my word for it, because I could hardly see a thing throughout the whole god damn movie. I think I did see some people get bitten, but it could be me self-projecting images based on what I was expecting to see.I wasn't really impressed with the hand-held gimmick, which gets old and what's worse tiresome very quickly. Shaky cam plus lack of lights throughout 80% of the movie means imagination is key to actually seeing anything.The only scene which really packed a wallop (and quite an intense one) is the final scene, where the camera goes into night-vision mode and you can actually feel something lurking just outside of the camera's view.No real character building, but that didn't really matter, as the pretence behind the horror really doesn't allow for anything like that. Plotwise not much to add to what was written above, but I must ask what the point was of cutting of electricity to a quarantined building? I can understand blocking off mobile signals or walkie talkies, but in what way was turning the lights off in the building helpful to anyone, except to maybe the director...I have yet to see Rec, but will soon catch up on the movie to compare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Film, Although Not as Great as REC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 2007 Spanish film REC, QUARANTINE chronicles the outbreak of a rabies-like disease in a Los Angeles apartment building and the struggle of the unaffected residents to stay alive after the authorities trap them inside in an effort to contain it...all through the lens of a news camera.I am quite a fan of REC. That film was one of the scariest films I've seen in a LONG TIME and I do really mean that. I don't usually say that phrase a lot. Of course, Hollywood bought the rights and decided to remake the film. Remakes, in general, don't bother me. I tend to score most remakes around a 5 because I think they were decent and nowhere near as bad as fans of the originals make it out to be.Anyway, getting right to the point, I think QUARANTINE serves the original film well, comparing to other remakes. There's no doubt that those who haven't seen the original will get more of a kick of it than when I saw the film because I knew what was going to happen. Saying that, this film does manage to bring some shocks and scares because of the change in situations. I was surprised when people say that this film is a shot for shot remake because it really wasn't.QUARANTINE is like REC, yes, recopying the essential scenes from the original, like the ending. HOWEVER, QUARANTINE is REC with different situations. Other than the basic plot outline, QUARANTINE presents different situations than the ones in REC. For example, there are now cellphones, an elevator, and even a substantially bigger cast! And I like that. There were some additions that I thought were better than the original film. One thing I complained about in the original was the explanation of the disease. In this one, it's much more realistic.There are also some suspenseful scenes as well, not surprisingly, including the last ten minutes of the film. Now that was scary. Even though it was an outright copy from the original, the last few minutes are very unnerving. As for the performances, Jennifer Carpenter did a fantastic job playing the character who mentally breaks down really well. Other than that, most of the cast members were actually pretty bad in this. Some exceptions include an opera teacher and his prodigal student, new characters that were not in the original film.In terms of story, I prefer QUARANTINE because I liked the situations, which I can relate more to than the ones presented in REC. I also loved the Gothic-style production design, another thing I found to be superior in this film. However, in terms of suspense and scariness, that would go to REC. REC builds the tension so well, unlike this film, where the scares are sporadic. I don't know what to say to the fans of the original. Sure, the remake was unnecessary but I thought the film was good. As for those who haven't seen the original, watch the original first and then see the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Piece of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it came to the rating of this film, I gave it a 1. I'm usually very lenient when it comes to rating films, but this I had to give a one. Mostly because the lead roles were poor in choice and the decision of making the film entirely documentary like. Not only was the shaking very annoying, but when films are shot in this perspective, the audience cannot get a full grasp of the events taking place. Honestly, I KNOW for a fact I can do a better job of directing a horror film than the director of this one. And all the actors, especially Jennifer Carpenter did the worst job of acting their roles. They made poor attempts on making the events seem real; their acting looked and felt like horrible acting, and not as if they were actually documenting true events. Screaming and crying are real things in scary situations, but this was just ridiculous, they took it to a level that was unrealistic and at the same time very very annoying, where you'd want to skip ahead to get on with the story. ALl in all, worst than the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so glad I watched the original (REC) first. Had I seen this version first I would have dismissed the whole idea and may not have watched REC. REC was a superb movie with a great storyline, brilliant acting, production, and cinemagraphy. Quarantine, on the other hand, was a cheap remake that failed to impress. I was looking forward to watching a good scary movie over the long weekend but this movie did nothing for me. I think the worst part of this movie was the acting and a few parts of the storyline. Don't waste time/money on this movie. If you want to treat yourself then watch REC and enjoy perhaps one of the scariest movies you'll ever see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indefensibly bad photography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so badly photographed my wife and I could not sit through the first half hour. The bad photography was not an accident. The story is (as the blurb on the box says) taken from a video tape made by a TV news photographer on the scene of the events in the movie. Accordingly it is seen through the lens of a hand held portable camera. But the shaking and jerking is so ludicrously overdone as to make watching the movie an exercise in being irritated. A real world TV photographer who couldn't shoot steadier pictures than those in this movie would have to find another job. The jumping and jerking around of the screen image is apparently intended to build tension as you try to perceive what's going on. But it's extremely and obnoxiously overdone. This is a cheap way to shoot a movie while passing off the low photographic quality as part of the story. In real movies steady and smooth photography is a ground rule requirement.I don't know how it comes out; we couldn't stand to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>20 minutes of "character development" that was pointless. It was like they had a good idea, but not enough to make a movie so they just grabbed a stopwatch and said, "ad-lib for 6:30". To prove the point, on the ride from the fire station to the building, we were forced to watch them drive to the scene for over 2 minutes. Wow. I cannot say enough bad things about this "movie". I have never seen Rec* which most people regard in much higher esteem than this trash, and I don't think I can bring myself to watch it after this. This one might actually be worse than Cloverfield.I can count on one hand the number of decent horror flicks since the 80's. Everything about this movie is beyond ridiculous.

		<fullReview>Just another horror movie with stupid writing. All the ridiculous things, all they had to do was break the glass front door. The story line alone provides the solution; the firemen plainly stated as they entered the building that they were bringing the tools necessary to break into the apartments if necessary. Then all of a sudden when the front door is 'locked', no one seems to know how to get out. What a crock. You know, it would have been easy enough to write the story so the apartment had steel doors or something. But nooooooo, they have to leave plot holes open so wide that the whole planet could fall through. It was difficult to watch the rest of the film after that ridiculous beginning. Probably a wonderful scary movie for 6 year olds who don't know how to use reasoning to figure out problems.</fullReview>

Although thats more of a personal distaste. But i really did find the movie to drag on. I was bored within the first 20 minutes spent at the fire department. I didn't even like the characters!So instead i walked to the nearest fast food place and ate a burger.

		<shortDescription>Nothing New and Not A Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most everything beyond this first paragraph will contain straight-up spoilers! Why write spoilers? Because I don't feel this film is good enough to keep any "surprises" secret...***SPOILERS AHEAD!!!***I walked out of the theater thinking, "This was a zombie movie combined with The Blair Witch concept...lame." It's essentially a reporter and her cameraman, trapped in a classic zombie situation and feeling compelled to maintain filming because "people have to see what's going on in here!" The film moves along with the suspenseful build up, your typical "This is what I think is going on here..." scene, unfulfilling climax and lame ending. The film ends abruptly for the type of ending that's supposed to be realistic and leave the viewer hanging (oh, I was hanging alright...hanging on to the last shred of dignity I had left after paying to see this).Jennifer Carpenter, the actress who plays the reporter, is not a bad actress. I first saw her in The Exorcism of Emily Rose and despite not liking that film either, gave her props for fully immersing herself in the role. I noticed her again as Deb in Dexter, the Showtime original series (excellent). She does a good job in Dexter after I was able to stop visualizing her writhing, contorting and screaming. And now she's back in the horror genre in Quarantine and she's whipped out that same formula of screaming/panting/ohmygodohmygod/scream again acting that she was so good at in Emily Rose. I'd really love to see her do something more worthwhile. She is nothing but irritating in this role.This film also employs the shaky hand-held camera work concept, but uses it liberally. The camera work was much worse in this film than say, Cloverfield. At least with Cloverfield, there were sporadic still moments throughout the film. Quarantine was just a jumbled, nauseating mess. I just know there had to be points where they edited out parts of the chase scenes, in the midst of all that shaking to keep the audience from noticing. I found myself wondering a few times, "How did they get there so fast??" There were also obvious parts where they sped up the film to make the actors look like they were hauling butt and maintain the fast pace. Of coarse, it's also worth noting a point someone made in a message board thread: why is the camera work so shaky when the guy filming is supposed to be a professional cameraman?? The storyline isn't any better. The first 30 min. is actually rather boring and establishes no connection for the viewer with the characters, the token "explanation" scene of mutated rabies is ridiculous and formulaic and the ending is a horror movie cliché. I was half expecting a Vincent Price-esquire "Mwahahahahaha!" to burst forth after the final scene went dark.My advice would be to wait for the rental. It's sometimes almost impossible to tell what's going on in parts because of the camera work and would probably be better viewed on a TV. It definitely wasn't worth the money I spent on gas and tickets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Quarantine late at night the other day, and found it to be intense, but there were just too many things wrong with it to give it anything better than a five. I'll give you four reasons why this is not a good movie.First, the characters lacked common sense. WHen you watch some person foaming from the mouth suddenly and violently attack someone, you don't approach another who has the same symptoms. THis happened a couple times and became laughable.Second, you see that these infected people can be killed just like a normal human being, but you instead run from them when you have weapons at your disposal. SInce the building was quarantined, and you weren't going to get out without being shot anyway, why not fight back and kill as many as you can, so that they couldn't attack you. After all, you were trapped in there with them, and unable to escape anyway. Killing them was the best way to save yourself. THere was one fire-fighter that actually did fight back, and killed several by himself while the other numb skulls just stood around. If they had worked together, they might've all survived.THird, the reason for the contagion was never fully explained. THis would've worked fine if they had not tried explaining what was happening in the first place, but they did, only to leave us with partial answers anyway. If you're going to give a reason, you need to be more clear about it. No playing games. THis isn't a television series.And finally, the plot was too predictable. It was Blair Witch meets 28 Days later. THere were no twists and nothing new was brought to the table. It was just more of the same. Cloverfield at least had a giant monster plot, and Blair Witch, well that movie created the unique idea in the first place. Other movies that follow the same plot-line need to add something to the mix so it doesn't become stale. Quarantine was stale.Overall this was not a horrible movie. THe acting was a little over the top, but not bad. THere were many intense scenes, especially the conclusion, but none of this is enough to make the movie any better than a C.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood cash in lacks bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under its well worn zombie attire, Quarantine poses one core question which is fundamental to our collective survival when the un-dead apocalypse finally arrives; namely, what do you do when you're faced with a crazed child who is baying for your blood? According to this new take on the zombie genre you casually saunter over and offer her a helping (re helping of) your hand to calm her down. I'm not entirely convinced. And unfortunately that sums up the fundamental problem with this movie. Relying on its sense of claustrophobia to create its tension and scares ? something the choice of filming via reality-cam is no doubt meant to enhance ? you'll wish you could suspend your disbelief long enough to be willingly whisked away on Dowdle's zombie roller-coaster. But if it's not the ridiculous lemming-like tendencies of the characters, it's the Hollywood cast, and no doubt thoughts of what their next projects might be, constantly pushing you out of a fairly enjoyable but ultimately forgettable experience.A tinsel-town remake of the 2007 Spanish film Rec, Quarantine takes you into a downtown Los Angeles apartment building on a seemingly routine call with the local fire-fighters. Seen through the lens of the late-night TV cameraman with the focus on our not unpleasant looking hostess (Sylvia Vidal, Dexter), we're quickly in the realms of panic and fear of having a limb chewed off and discarded like the remains of last night's KFC bargain bucket. Much of the dread is no doubt meant to be generated by her reaction to the unfolding events which she achieves not wholly unsuccessfully. However, when actors start popping up right and left that you recognise from your favourite TV shows (Dania Ramirez, Heroes) and less favourite movies (Jay Hernandez, Hostel), the illusion starts to fall apart. Casting well-knowns in most Hollywood movies is expected, but given that Quarantine comes crawling from underneath the Blair Witch/Cloverfield stable of frights, we're expecting a level of reality here that familiar faces - unless their performances are truly stellar - cannot deliver.Ultimately only the last act can provide any real scare value as you start to forget about the chosen cast (or they're now off camera being eaten/eating someone!) and we're thrust head first into darkness with a palpable sense of doom and the feeling that there is something more disturbing and nefarious at work than we've been led to believe. However, this late peak can't save the film and even with lesser-knowns it's hard to believe that there'd be that much more engagement to be had with the characters on offer here. The protagonists are fairly intent on bringing about their own wretched demise which we're forced to endure as we cringe at their stupidity. They're remarkably slow at coming to terms with their predicament and the need to protect themselves with anything other than tail-chasing. After all, these are no shambling Romero zombies they're up against. These guys have been to the Zack Snyder school for the exceptionally athletic un-dead and they're in desperate need of a human shaped protein boost.To summarise, taking its cues from every zombie and reality-cam flick over the last few years, Quarantine tries to inject something new into its chosen sub-genre but falls flat. It's a movie stuck between two stools ? the Hollywood money making machine and its blood thirsty indie roots. That's not to say it's not partially fun, it's just that if you want to watch a decent modern zombie flick, you're best off sticking with Shaun of the Dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been MUCH Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in with high hopes for this one, since I was such a big fan of Cloverfield. Unfortunately, this movie didn't live up to the hype.The camera angles have been complained about, but there seems to be a general consensus: though the first person POV is the same one used in Cloverfield, this movie actually utilizes it in a way that WILL often cause motion-sickness. Any time anything at all happened, from a character talking or a noise heard in a room upstairs, the cameraman would flip out and try to film everything he possibly could in all directions. The intense scenes...well, I could understand if the graphics sucked, and they couldn't justify showing some things so they resorted to camera movements, but from the few frames the audience is shown, the graphics look pretty awesome, so the fact that so little is shown almost seems to be a waste of budget. Unfortunately, because of the crazy camera movement, the entire movie seem panicked- which wasn't necessary, considering the plot.But, I overlooked that, because I was especially hooked on the fact that the government sealed all the doors and locked them inside. Any conspiracy theory and I'm instantly focused. However, this movie sucked at implementing the idea. Within 2 minutes of a random rescue crew going into a building, they find out that all of the doors are locked, the FBI and SWAT teams and government officials and disease control are outside, and that's pretty much it.The execution of the plot was abysmal. Okay, the first diseased monster attacks. No real result. Someone gets infected. That diseased monster attacks a few minutes later. No real result. By about halfway through, most people are killed because they just can't figure out that when a person gets bitten, they'll pretty much try to kill you as the next step. Disease control comes in, presumably forgetting why they sealed the building off in the first place, and are attacked when testing an infected person. Surprise! When people finally figure out that a bite results in a new zombie, they still don't kill anyone who gets bitten, and instead stand around looking concerned until they get attacked by another zombie who jumps out of nowhere. Then, a few minutes later, they run into the person who pretty much told them, "I was bitten and will kill you in a few minutes." The beginning is fun because the lead character is hot. The middle is a bit interesting because everyone is so stupid, though it is predictable. By the end, however, there's really no way for it to turn out other than inevitably, so the last half hour is just sort of a closing up of the movie. The last ten minutes brings tons of questions that you don't really want to be answered because it means the movie would have to be longer, and by the end, most people in my theater were sort of just like, "Ugh, finally."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I went to this movie on a date with my boyfriend the second day it came out. I had been waiting to see a good infected/zombie movie since I watched some a few weeks earlier. Yet, this movie made me sick. Literally. As for it being so great as everyone said, it was all because of the hype and that was all. It sucked.This movie is disappointing. For the first hour and ten minutes of the movie there was nothing but running back and forth from the third floor and down back to the lobby to find keys, weapons, and gather people in the lobby. As for the infected,they are pretty much out of it in another room as a cop is freaking out about being stuck in the building. Along with the boring antics of doing nothing for most of the movie, their is also in question the constant, cliché screaming of "OH MY GOD! WE'RE GOING TO DIE!!" Seriously. Talk about overused in movies much? Were the directors that lame and clichéd they had to overuse lines? I seriously went home complaining of feeling horrible. My head was killing me and I was massively dizzy. I mean Cloverfield didn't even do that to me! and my boyfriend complained of a stomach ache and headache. That must mean their lack of camera skills really did suck. I mean as for Jennifer Carpenter, her acting was rather well done for in the case of infected people. However, I will give some...SOME props. For one, the infected idea. I mean rabies? I liked that idea. For two, was the gore. Well done with the cuts and attacks and the popping out of the bone? Gross but, well done! And three? Well...okay no more than two.As for my overall review, I say please PLEASE do not even bother wasting your money on this movie. If you really want to see this movie, just wait till it comes out and watch it on pay-per-view. That is if you want an hour and a half of you life drained from you that could be used to do better things. Seriously. Do not even bother. If you want a good infected/zombie movie, watch Resident Evil or Dawn of the Dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the get-go you gotta wonder the following words: "what is the point????" I mean it. What is the point of this damn movie?! The end of the movie is spoiled by not just the trailer, but the official movie poster too!!! Secondly, if all these people are trapped in the building cordoned off by the CDC and they will be shot and killed for so much as looking out the window, what is the point of the rest of the movie?! They can't get out, they're not going to find a cure, so the conclusion is about the most obvious thing in the world. What is the point of this movie except to be another sloppy POV horror flick? It wasn't even as good as Cloverfield(Which by the way I did not like at all), and it was silly when the cameraman uses the lens(Yes, the lens!) of his camera to beat the living hell out of a rage Zombie coming at him. The lens and the camera however are perfectly intact. So much for the realism huh? Anyways everyone in the movie is also a complete damn moron because they all make really stupid, really dumb decisions atypical of anyone who is in a horror movie. They handcuff a zombie to the stairway, they are completely clueless when they see a human that should be dead walking around going "BRAINSS!!! BRAINNNNSSS!!!". This movie is just stupid, silly, weak, and I hope to God that this is the end of the retarded POV genre that began with the Blair Witch project... or was it the Bare wench project?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seriously don't understand why so many people are saying how good this movie is. The only positive thing I can say about this, is that it did have some thrills here and there and the acting wasn't that bad, but a few thrills simply isn't enough to save this film from it's terrible flaws and annoying characters. The camera work was simply horrible. Half of the time I couldn't see what was going on because it was so shaky. The characters were very annoying and they weren't very smart either. Ordinarily you would care enough for them that you would want the characters to and make it out alive. However, that's not the case here. Almost every character set themselves up to be killed/infected. Instead of using the cops gun, they'd use things such as, a sledgehammer, the camera, etc. Another thing that just didn't make sense was that instead of just killing the zombies on sight they would take their chances trying to help them and risk getting bitten, very ridiculous. This movie is a complete waste and offers little to no entertainment value whatsoever and fails miserably at everything it tries to achieve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***CONTAINS SPOILERS*** Let me start of by saying that I'm not bashing this film because I've seen the original. No. Even if I hadn't seen the original, I'd still have a lot of problems with this film. First off, a lot of the characters simply disappeared and reappeared infected. You had no knowledge of how they were infected. The writers of this script did not give us enough background information on the infection. When Angela and Scott enter the empty apartment on the top floor, you see for a few seconds a bunch of articles. But they didn't show enough for the audience to get any solid info. The tenants of the building didn't have much character development. The entire film focused on Angela, Scott, and the fireman. The tenants were simply background people. The last person we see in the empty apartment was not as scary as I'd have liked her to be. I found the plot kind of choppy as well. The movie seemed really rushed and there were scenes that could've been made longer and better, rather than short and sloppy. On the more positive side however, this film did have some good makeup effects and the camera wasn't extremely shaky so it was easy to watch. In conclusion, if you're looking to watch a good, scary zombie flick, I recommend the original.</fullReview>

Overall, the director's take made the movie not possible to grab the audience attention through half of its running time.

		<fullReview>Yes folks, mainstream American cinema can't stand the fact that a non-American country has made an absolutely genius horror film that happened to be scariest film that many people, myself included, has seen, I'm of course talking about the excellent Spanish horror film REC and i can applaud that film till the cows come home but let me now vent my frustration with something like Quarantine. Released in 2008, barely a year after REC, Quarantine sought to bring true fear back to mainstream horror by not doing anything original of course but by making a carbon copy of a really, really good film. The results here are disastrous, in true American style everything had to be "bigger! Better!". 'It's shot hand held huh? WELL LETS MAKE IT SHAKY AS HELL! Whoa it's gonna freak the audiences out! It's gonna reflect America's current social climate and all the fears we live every day because we're a repressed country!' Well i could rant on and on and go off topic but this is THE worst horror remake i have EVER seen followed closely by The Shining(nice one Stephen), The Fog, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and of course Psycho. Please, please, please i implore you, DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, WATCH REC! RANT!!!!! Thankyou!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A news crew spending a night at a firehouse goes out on rescue call on one of the trucks. Once at the scenes the victim they are suppose to be helping goes nuts and attacks one of rescuers.

Yet another dip in the well of another countries horror out put, I suppose we should be happy it isn't a remake of a Japanese film. The film is more often then not an almost exact copy of the earlier film (many sets are almost identical) that one wonders why the original wasn't given a proper US release instead of being remade. The films short comings are numerous with the pace of things being slowed down, you can actually see things you couldn't in the earlier film, the motion of the camera doesn't feel real (there are also too many cuts, much of the earlier film happens in long takes that don't look good, here everything looks composed) and worst of all the film is full of actors who are recognizable from somewhere. The conceit of the film is that this is a found tape, why would you hire people who have faces you know? The whole affair feels bloated with more of everything. Had I not watched the original film earlier in the day I know I would have liked it more, though I still wouldn't have loved it.If you've seen the earlier film 4.5 out of ten, if not 6ish out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my rating based on my comparison to the original film REC.Spoilers...The film had all of the intensity to keep you on the edge of your seat...but the ending was ruined. NO, not because it was in the trailers or the posters. The ending was ruined because it left out what that creature was in the penthouse. The man that rented the penthouse was doing experiments on a girl who had some strange disease. A bug bit her up there and traveled downstairs and bit the family dog that had to go to the vet. (in QUARANTINE they probably used a rat instead of a bug due to there being rats up there). In Quarantine, the newspaper clippings mentioned an "armaggedon" which still didn't explain anything, and there were no words on the recording they played. In REC, the newspaper clips were about the girl and the recording actually had words on it. I would have been absolutely okay with Quarantine if they didn't mess up the ending.And a side note....Jennifer Carpenter is a horrible actress :-P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an almost scene for scene copy of the much better REC, a Spanish film taking place in Barcelona. To make it fair, I watched both day after day, and went into both with an open mind.Simply put, I have no idea how Hollywood managed to think that a remake was necessary? They could have just dubbed the original, put it out in the US theaters, saved on production costs and made more cash for everyone.Long story short is watch the original, don't bother with the remake, character development is much better, Angela Vidal is better is Spanish and more human than Carpenter, and notwithstanding overall character development is better in the original.From what I've heard it's even wore is that the director doesn't even mention during the commentary that the film is based on REC, doesn't mention i.e. "that this same scene was in the original and we though it was great so we used it ourselves." Total ripoff, total rubbish, total Hollywood crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Los Angeles, the reporter Ángela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) and the cameraman Scott are covering the night-shift of local fire station. When the firemen receive a distress call from a lady in a building, Ángela and Scott go in the firefighter truck with the firemen Jake (Jay Hernandez) and Bernard (Bernard White) with Scott recording each step. When they arrive in the building under siege of the police, they find the hysterical dwellers gathered in the lobby in the entrance and they hear screams upstairs. Jake and Bernard go upstairs with two policemen and followed by Ángela and Scott, and they find an aggressive old lady that attacks one policeman with several bites. When they return to the lobby, they find that they are sealed in the building and trapped with the residents claiming for an explanation and dreadful screams upstairs in the beginning of a chaotic and nightmarish night.The claustrophobic and scary "Rec" is certainly one of the best zombie movies I have ever seen, with the story disclosed through the lens of a camcorder. The screenplay gives an incredible realism and atmosphere to the plot and discomfort to the viewers. The charming Manuela Velasco is stunning and the acting is top-notch with an amazing cast and the pace is perfect. "Quarentine" is an unnecessary remake frame by frame without any originality, recalling those cheap and useless reproductions of famous paintings, i.e., without any merit or value. My advice: read the subtitles and see "Rec" instead. My vote is one.Title (Brazil): "Quarentena" ("Quarantine")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>REC vs. Quarantine - My take on the matter:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's my one word review: DisappointedThe remake was better and I'll tell you why. For one, the Spanish version had little or no character development. I didn't feel for the Spanish cast. In fact, I generally disliked the Spanish female reporter. She came across as a b*tch with all of her "cut filming if the interviewee sucks" attitude towards journalism. She said it several times. Other than that she was obviously completely terrified that is about the extent of development of her character. In the English version her character was 100 times more interesting. She was excited about the job. She was funny. Was living her dream of being a fire fighter by documenting the job. There was sexual tension between her and the fire fighters. She was a fun interviewer. If I had to choose between an English or Spanish version of "While you're Asleep", there wouldn't even be a decision to make. The Spanish chick was boring and the show wouldn't have made it through half a season.The fire fighters in the Spanish version also did not have any character. They didn't even have a heroic presence like the men in the remake. They had no sense of humor. Gods, I don't know how to even put this other than: They had no character and I felt nothing for them. Their deaths were as meaningless as the deaths of all the other players who only had a few seconds of screen time.That's probably enough about the character... or lack thereof.Now, about the horror.The English version was many times more brutal. The action was more intense. The special effects were more impressive. Take for example the camera man beating the woman to death with his camera and we get to see the whole thing through the camera's eye. Or of the rabid woman who gets tossed over the balcony and falls three floors twisting and spinning till she splats on the linoleum. There wasn't a single moment of horror in the Spanish film that impressed me. There was nothing that I hadn't seen before 100 times in any other cheesy flesh-eating-zombie-flick.In the remake, the sickness seemed more realistic, and gradual, with the foaming mouths and that general "on the brink of death look". The sick little girl, in the Spanish film, almost vampire-like, transformed instantly and bit her mother. Supposedly "dead" people became alive again, giving the Spanish film more of a zombie horror feel instead of a movie about a biological hazard. What's up with that?At any rate... by my standards, Quarantine was far better a film than REC. I'm glad they decided to do a remake for the English crowd. I would have watched the Spanish version and passed it off as nothing special, just like 99% of all the other sh*tty horror out there. Quarantine, however beat the odds and made it to that coveted 1% that I hold so dear in my heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one of those "so bad it's good" films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, originality is really hard to come by nowadays, especially in a world of sequels, and in this case, remakes. What we've got here is a horror remake that delivers the scares, but unfortunately also delivers a lot of laughs and nothing new in the originality department, rather borrowing from other horror and thriller films, particularly 28 Days Later, Cloverfield, and Saw III.Let's start with the obvious Cloverfield comparisons, foremost of which is the shaking camera. I felt that the use of a hand-held camera worked for Cloverfield worked very well, but here it wasn't used at its full potential. They could have amped up the scare factor even more by using the camera to their advantage. Only a few times did the use of the camera become a bright spot of the film (and boy, those were great, especially one of the most hilarious and awesome scenes in any horror movie).I really found the 'acting' in this film to be laughable, outside of Nicholas Gonzalez and Jennifer Carpenter. Columbus Short breaks his string of good performances with his spot-off portrayal of a young and confused police officer. There could have been a lot more development as well. Carpenter's performance in the lead role is what I would call the "least laughable". Though she does the 'scared' stuff really well, she excessively repeated a lot of lines that really got on my nerves. I can't tell whether I blame her or the director for this.Quarantine can fortunately fall into the "so bad it's good" category, as there are a few scenes that are unintentionally hilarious, particularly some of the more "emotional" scenes, and pretty much every scene involving the old woman and the little girl. When are writers going to learn? In your run of the mill horror movie, old people and five year old girls are not scary! They're hilarious! The film boasts one of the most laughably bad scripts, one that even contains the line, "I'll be forced to force you out", as if the repetitive obvious crap of "why is this happening to me" wasn't bad enough.I also have major problems with the plot of the movie as well. The unseen police and CDC officers do not act as they should, and the plot is just absolutely ridiculous. To me, if you're going to have even a slightly absurd plot, you need to take it all the way out there, much like Cloverfield did by turning it into a monster movie. A good ol' fashioned rabies movie is great, but when you go out of your way to tell the viewer that the "villain" is NOT regular rabies, you get more questions, and Quarantine lacked answers for it.Basically, what you've got here is a cheap and horribly scripted remake with occasional scares and non stop laughs. It seems as if it's the American prequel to 28 Days Later (had this been set in the UK, they might as well have called it that), mixed with a bit of Cloverfield, and it lacks the effectiveness of either of those landmark horror/thriller films. Quarantine is, at best, something for you and your friends to watch at a party to laugh at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love that blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young TV reporter and her cameraman accompany firefighters to an apartment building where a reclusive tenant, an old woman, is apparently in severe distress. The cops are already there, and they all enter her apartment. She is naked and disoriented, and quickly puts the bite on one of her would-be rescuers. When the group tries to exit the building with the stricken man, they find they are locked in. A deadly virus apparently is loose in the building, and the government (which may have developed the virus in the first place) isn't letting anyone out. Hence, the movie's title. One by one, other people in the building become infected and all hell breaks loose. Eventually, everything leads to an attic apartment where -- well, see the movie to find out the answer to the whole thing. The movie also comes to a dilly of a climax. The amount of blood spilled in this remake of a popular Spanish film is awesome. A grue lover's delight, and very claustrophobic in its feel. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many old sayings can be said in a new way and still sound great. So in this line of thoughts I'm not against making remakes. There are many examples for great movies with excellent remakes - Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Thing, The Italian Job, King Kong and probably others that I can't remember right now. All these movies however are relatively old and need an update to be liked and understood by today's audience.In this case however ... the original "Rec" was released just a year ago. It has fresh ideas, it's well made and well played. It doesn't need a remake! I can't imagine what idiots met somewhere in Hollywood and decided that a trash remake will sell better than the original on the local market. If they are right - I can't imagine how chauvinistic and narrow-minded you guys are.If you want to watch a good movie - find a way to watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, give Jennifer Carpenter an Oscar or something, because her performance in this film, especially the last 30 minutes of it, completely blew me away. The movie itself, was very good, extremely scary, and done very well for what it is. I have not yet watched Rec, yet, so my opinion here is based solely on how I felt about this film alone, without comparing it to the original. I was glued to my seat, and honestly had to plug my ears and half hide my eyes at a couple parts because the tension was so high and I just knew there was something horrific about to happen; the fear and terror portrayed by Carpenter on screen was palpable. I don't think I've ever seen an actress go as far in a horror film as Carpenter does here. She completely gives it her all, and at some points I wondered if she didn't just collapse or totally pass out after shooting some scenes,. She works herself up into tho most believable frenzy of fear, terror and panic that I have ever witnessed in a horror film before. She carried the movie for me. This movie is definitely worth a watch, if for nothing else than to see her performance. But on it's own and as a whole it really is a very entertaining, creepy movie.</fullReview>

In the isolated sandbox the infected ravage each other and take out and/or infect any other survivors along the way. However, sometimes a movie comes along that breaks the trend; this is one such movie. The movie starts out as a reporter doing a journalist report surrounding the action at the fire department. The beginning is so misleading ? it had me forgetting that this was a horror movie; it isn't until they are in an apartment and odd things start to happen between the residents that the movie reveals itself. The local government of the outside world isolates the building and misleads everyone into thinking all survivors have been evacuated. The movie has high tension as each character is picked off one by one; however, the characters are able bodied and are not afraid to attack the infected if they get too close. The movie also has a few shocking surprises that are completely unexpected. This movie is a recovered footage film in disguise; but it won't reveal this facet until much later. I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinematic Turd In Comparison To The Vastly Superior REC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being an almost scene-to-scene rehash of the Spanish horror masterpiece, REC, Quarantine is one of the worst remakes in existence. Made specifically for the viewers who can't read but are too smug to admit it and use the stupid excuse of distraction caused by subtitles as their defence, Quarantine is one of those crappy films you deserve to watch if you can't be bothered to read a few subtitles.Set in Los Angeles, the story of Quarantine follows a television reporter &amp; her cameraman as they are assigned to follow a firefighting crew on their night shift duty. Things are set in motion when they respond to a call coming from a small apartment building but soon find themselves locked inside it along with its residents when the place is quarantined by CDC without an explanation and end up filming much more than they bargained for.Written &amp; directed by John Erick Dowdle (known for The Poughkeepsie Tapes), Quarantine fails at everything that the original managed to get right with immaculate precision for this film has no understanding whatsoever of what actually made REC work so well in the first place. The direction is terrible as Dowdle is unable to recreate the bone-chilling atmosphere and the screenplay is poorly written as well for the dialogues end up feeling quite forced.Another problem with Quarantine is its unconvincing cast. They all seem so well rehearsed with their lines and equally aware of the camera hovering over them that they end up trying a little too hard, because of which the whole realistic approach this film was aiming for falls apart. Carpenter's performance is better than the rest but still not good enough to keep the film together. Camera-work fails to recreate the frenzy, chaotic style of the original, Editing is a mixed bag for the pacing is fine but its runtime is unnecessarily extended.On an overall scale, Quarantine is a half-assed attempt to remake one of the scariest films of all time and despite being filmed with six times the budget fails to improve upon or even match any of the aspects of the original. If Americanising a film usually means lowering the IQ of the original characters and allowing them to act stupidly, as evident in so many other examples, then world cinema would definitely be a much better place if no foreign language is ever allowed a Hollywood adaptation. All in all, Quarantine is a cinematic turd that itself should be quarantined from the filmgoing audience. Skip it &amp; savour the vastly superior REC instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does very well at scaring people, and if you're after a 1st person zombie-apocalypse thriller, this has it all. The acting is convincing and the effects and immersion are very compelling.On the whole however. I found the characters to be somewhat dim-witted, slow, stupid, and emotionally compromised. Of course, some early mistakes were forgivable. But the clues were more than obvious. The main characters showed no capacity to anticipate the situation. Even after multiple fatal attacks, those with weapons didn't use them when any rational person might. They made no attempts as self-isolation, and actually tried to breach external containment (when they knew full well that they'd be risking the entire population of the city).The biggest criticism I'd have to save for the main character. Who ends up just being a hyper-ventilating, and quivering emotional wreck. The performances were so overly dramatized, and irritating to watch. The whole idea that such a group of dysfunctional people could survive for so long makes this whole film unrealistic. Most people who live through survival situations don't act this way. Panic very quickly gives way to a fight or flight response. Those that opt for panic are usually the first ones to die, and those that opt to fight are usually second.There are no really strong characters to rally behind, or admire. Except perhaps for the fireman, or the man behind the camera, who we don't really get to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quite possibly the most unnecessary remake of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine is a remake of the Spanish found-footage horror film, REC.REC was a fantastic horror film, and Quarantine is nothing more than an almost identical copy of it. It is apparent that the filmmakers had no artistic or creative agenda, and their sole intention was to make money. I find it baffling that this film was even made without loads of copyright issues. The film, in and of itself, is not awful, the camera-work and cinematography was very good, and the lack of music and long camera takes made for a very raw and realistic feel. However, neither of those things impressed me since they are merely a mimic of the original film. The performances and dialogue felt much more scripted and cliché, the blood/gore effects were bad, and possibly worst of all, the ending/climax of the movie was completely changed and made stupid and awful. The one thing that the Quarantine has to stand apart from it's source material is the ending, but the change was entirely for the worse. Overall, for someone who has never seen REC, Quarantine may seem okay, but for someone who has, it was maddeningly terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Face-off (adaptation edition): Quarantine v The Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reality camera-crew accompanies firemen on a routine call-out, to find themselves trapped in a quarantined apartment block full of infectious zombie thingies.Step-by-step remake of the original from Spain, which is famous for its final sequence.I think the direction, acting and editing is mostly superior. The original had way too much shouting, and the lead actress became irritating far too early. This actress does go irritatingly hysterical - pull yourself together, woman! - but at a relatively late stage. And the plot is tightly bound with properly placed pointers so you don't lose track in the chaos.But what about the ending? Everybody knows the creepiest thing ever committed to film is the end sequence in Ringu, which got the American treatment in The Ring, a film that improved hugely on the pace and drama of the original but simply couldn't match that sequence.In this case it seems the film makers thought they had to vary things through camera technique - so the last 20 mins has deeply annoying black screen intervals added to shaky-cam, and the tense last minutes are directed very badly with far too much movement and noise. Grrr.Overall an effective chiller, but if you know the original it's kinda pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining And Jumpy But Purely Average!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I myself am a huge fan of zombies and other similar creations in movies, therefore it only seemed logical that my first review was based on a movie which should have had everything I needed! The scares, the thrill, the storyline etc? and in some cases "Quarantine" did not disappoint, however in other areas it was not up to the standard that I was hoping. The acting of a movie is one of the most important components of a movie because if either of these areas fail then the movie is likely as not going to be disastrous. In the case of Quarantine I say the acting was fairly average, not because there were some bad actors/actresses and some good ones but rather that the majority of the characters were not that difficult to portray. For instance, one of the main characters was Angela Vidal a local news reporter (played by Jennifer Carpenter) who throughout the whole movie only really portrayed two or three emotions, in this case she was either the determined news reporter or petrified young woman. As said earlier I am not saying that Jennifer Carpenter or any other member of the cast performed their roles badly and in the case of Jennifer I in fact she played her character in a very believable manner. My main issue with the acting as said before is that there was a lack of variety in characters. However I would like to highlight one character/actor who I thought was great throughout, the character Columbus Short (played by Danny Wilensky) displayed an inner struggle between a cop doing his job and someone who was obviously scared out of their minds. Out of all the cast I thought Danny Wilensky deserved a mention. Although the limit of the characters can be partly blamed on the writing it could also be partly the blame of the director who is supposed to drive the movie. Despite this I think that John Erick Dowdle was a fairly decent director who was able to put his own spin on a movie which was by its definition a remake of the movie "Rec". In particular I liked how the camera man was fairly quiet throughout the movie. As the movie uses the technique of POV (Point Of View) filming it is very easy for the camera man to take some of the attention away from other aspects of a movie. In the case of "Quarantine" this could have meant that certain "jumpy points" would have been less scary because the camera man's intrusion could have spoilt the moments leading up to it. However I do have to say that I found the lack of ingenuity in all aspects of the movie to be quiet disappointing, I cannot think of one point in the movie where I saw an original idea. As stated earlier I am aware that this is a remake so I am not comparing this to "Rec" instead I found myself thinking of the movie "Cloverfield". As Cloverfield was released much earlier in 2008 (it was released in January/February while "Quarantine" was released in October/November).The structure of "Quarantine" is fairly standard for a horror movie, the first half is used to set the scene and to slowly introduce the viewer to the story while the second half is where the viewer gets the thrill of being scared. This again highlights how "Quarantine" is not a very unique movie as it follows the standard horror movie structure. Again this is seen with the plot with the majority of characters being killed off/infected within the last 20/30 minutes of the movie. However despite its lack of ingenuity "Quarantine" does have its positives when it comes to the plot! For instance the movie itself is a fairly realistic representation of what would happen if there was a very infectious disease within a given location. Also the virus itself (rabies or similar) is more realistic than other zombie-like diseases seen in movies. This helped me to relate to the story and the characters which in turn immersed me in the story which meant I jumped more often than if I did not believe in the story.I thought the lack of music was in fact a very good technique used by the Director (John Erick Dowdle) mainly because it made me believe that I was watching something that can actually happen in real life. This is a key aspect for any horror movie as a lack of belief (at least in my case) makes me much less scared of the movie as a whole. However it should be stated that "Quarantine" may have benefited from the tension which music sometimes creates. This is because I found that "Quarantine" was jumpy rather than scary. By this I mean that there were plenty of points in the movie where I jumped however I was never really on the edge of my seat as a result of me being scared witless. In the case of the realism the special effects overall I have to stay that it was decent, the most used special effect was blood and other such injuries. Generally the blood was realistic and the injuries weren't too over the top (e.g. the wounds weren't overly gory etc?).Overall my main impression of "Quarantine" is that it is purely average, it's not original and although it is an entertaining and jumpy movie it is not scary which is what you want a horror movie to be!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent (but unnecessary) remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two ways of looking at 'Quarantine.' The first is that it's actually the (Hollywood) remake of Spanish classic horror film 'REC.' If you've already seen REC then you probably don't need to see the remake. It doesn't bring anything new to the story and is ? almost ? a shot for shot remake, albeit in English without the subtitles.However, if you can't be bothered watching the Spanish film with English subtitles (and you're also a bit of a horror/zombie fan) then you may appreciate Quarantine. It's one of those 'found footage' films. This basically means that it's shot from point-of-view at all times, as we follow a reporter (Dexter's Jennifer Carpenter) as she reports on a fire crew who have been called in to investigate a building late at night. Of course things go horribly wrong when the Government seal off the building, trapping those left inside with a horde of ravenous zombies.The zombies are the 'modern' type ? no George Romero 'shufflers' here. Instead, we have the type who run at you while screaming into the camera and doing their best to bite your head off.It's worth making mention of the film's set. It was a purpose-built apartment complex, made specially for the film. Therefore the cast can run pretty much where they like and you get a good sense of their claustrophobic environment. Plus, having a decent leading actress helps elevate Quarantine over the dozens of run-of-the-mill zombie/B-movies out there.With so many undead movies out there, it's difficult to get that excited over Quarantine. However, if you're not (also) totally sick of 'found footage' movies, haven't seen REC and feel like sitting through quite an intense little offering, then you might like to give this one a go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really get the negativity about this film. It's probably due to the fact it's a remake of a foreign horror which to some appears to be a complete no no. I have seen REC and for me they are pretty much the same however I enjoyed this film more. For anyone who hasn't seen the original and who likes horror then this should hit the mark.There are a few negatives, the start is pretty slow and the acting isn't brilliant. However once the action starts (pretty early on) it's pretty relentless and never less than totally entertaining. It has all the elements of a good horror, gore, tension and a feeling of dread topped off by a good ending. For me this is one of the better straightforward modern horrors. If you can forgive the fact it's a Hollywood remake then you should enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Masterpiece, but a good scare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine isn't one of those shows you say was brilliant or extremely well done. It is, however, the perfect movie if you're looking for a quick scare in the dark. It has good jumpy parts in it and the perspective using the camera was perfect to convey a feeling that you were actually there. Quarantine keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole film, and I will admit I screamed out loud at a few parts. I feel what really got me was the use of the camera making you feel like you were there. Jennifer Carpenter's(Angela) acting was great and made you feel like she was really there and scared and helped to add to the realistic feelings. As great as the scare factor was, it was an okay movie at best. It was nothing you would go and say later that it left you thinking. Quarantine was more of a quick, jumpy scare movie that you don't watch twice for fun. There's no reason to go that far into critiquing this movie very closely, there isn't much to say about it's quality. If you're looking for a real zombie/plague movie, this isn't one of them. This is just another scary, jumpy movie that you can rent and then return.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I owe an apology to Chernobyl Diaries...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie and I'm completely shocked. Well, not because it was so good. OMG, this movie is beyond simple bad. There are good horrors, there are not-so-good horrors with a few or many stupid characters or story or both and there is Quarantine. I've never seen a movie so annoying. What you need for being able to watching this film till the end? Serious self-control and enormous will-power. Why do I think that? 1. The whole story is an unreal, illogical something with random scenes put together. I guess it was meant to be scary, but it was painfully, frustratingly irritating. 2. Characters: over-hysterical, unreal, annoying. Main character Angela could easily be a nominee for "The most annoying horror heroine ever" award. After the first hour I wanted to slap her so bad to make her stop screaming just for being able to tell her this: Sweetie, do me a favor and die already, this way not only your suffering will come to an end but mine too. 3. This film is also classified as SF. How come? Just using the word "virus" and showing a lame lab for a few minutes with Gollum's brother will not make anything SF. This is the first time I'm questioning IMDb policy of not having 0 as an option for voting. As this was the first time that a movie made me downright angry due to lacking even a single enjoyable moment, I think this is a historical day to me: I've just seen the worst movie of my life. Not simply the worst horror, but worst in an all-genre, all-time list. I hope Chernobyl Diaries will forgive me for declaring it one of the worst horrors ever made. Everything is relative. So true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously this film came out a while ago but if you haven't watched it like I hadn't I would find something else. Also I haven't watched the REC Spanish original so am not biased to this remake in anyway.Quarantine can kill an hour of your time (just about) but apart from that it's just plain stupid. The characters instead of wanting to be survivors seem intent on joining the rabid zombie types by committing a range of basic survival mistakes. Like getting way too close to diseased people that have just eaten someones face off and failing to pick up and use suitable weapons against the infected.Never seen a bunch of more trusting characters in a horror film ever.No new ways to scare the viewer and Carpenter's character screams a lot, to the point I wanted to see her dead way before the end of the film.I will watch the Spanish original and may well come back to edit this review down to 1 star instead of 2 if it really is much better than this dross.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's quite annoying when a little foreign horror masterpiece arrives and is a success and then the Americans snap it up literally five minutes later and plan a shot for shot remake for those who can't read. I'm not going to slag off people who can't be bothered to read subtitles because I used to be one of those people. I thought, 'how the hell can anyone watch a film with subtitles? How would you suppose to follow what's happening on screen with words?' It wasn't until I was forced to watch an absolutely incredible French horror film called "Martyrs" with subtitles that I realised they really were not a bother in the slightest. Once you start watching it you no longer realise they're there (especially with a film like "Martyrs" which is so absorbing anyway). So I urge anyone who hasn't seen "REC" or "Quarentine" to go and watch "REC" FIRST! Because it really is much, much better.When Americans remake a foreign film they usually feel that they can do a straight copy without trying to improve upon the original. REC is a hard film to improve upon and I gave it the full 10/10 for being one of the scariest and pulse-pounding films I've ever seen. But "Quarantine" could've at least attempted to add to REC's scares by putting in more zombie action, or creating deeper characterisation and with "Quarantine" being about 10 minutes extra than REC you'd expect to see that. Instead they decide to fill up REC's short running time with more pointless footage at the firefighter HQ. I don't care about a Victorian fireman's hook or about the Dalmatian that can stop, drop and roll (although that was cute) I want to see a thrilling horror film! REC is only 1hr 15minutes long and it's that long because it gets straight to the point and doesn't doss about, which makes it feel about 15 minutes longer because of the excitement. "Quarentine" feels longer because of the extra boredom.However, after the second death "Quarantine" does attempt to be a little different and it does a good job in being tense and thrilling, and I'm sure that if I hadn't seen or known about REC then I'd be sitting here giving it a 7 or 8 out of 10. But I've seen REC and I know that it is so much more tense and scary. One of "Quarantine's" problems is that it looks like a film and lacks the authenticity that REC possessed. It's much less convincing and scenes look too set-up or clumsy, whereas REC looked natural and was also fantastically shot."Quarantine" is also less effective. I squirm all the way through the last part of REC and it is easily the scariest part of the whole film. No film makes me feel the way REC does and I'm quite easy to spook! But the ending in "Quarantine" is tense but not as memorable. It copies the ending of REC in a much less terrifying way, although the attic scene did still give me a big jolt! In the end REC is better. The acting is more convincing, as is the whole film. It also has a much less hysterical woman presenting (the woman in "Quarantine" does begin to get a bit annoying). But it's still a fun film and one of the better remakes. However, it is pointless and has prevented more people from seeing REC. So GO AND SEE REC! I don't think I've said REC enough times. REC!</fullReview>

The plot is about a group of residents, police an a small news team trapped in an apartment block, with a virus that turns people into, basically, fast dangerous zombies. I'm a fan of zombie films, so I enjoyed this. It is actually quite clever and more than just a zombie flick. It shows the true reaction of the government is this happened and the brutal decisions people must make if this happened. I thought the zombies in this film were excellent and scared you. I thought that the acting was alright and the cast where quite unknown (except for Greg Germann). I thought this was good because it makes the whole film more believable and thrilling. The ending was good and made you jump, it was also a bit frustrating as well. I would only recommend this film to people who like zombie films and people who enjoy horrors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very poor, shot-for-shot remake of the superlative Spanish horror flick REC. Despite my fondness for the 'found footage' sub-genre, QUARANTINE is every bit the patience-tester and although it features exactly the same story and action of the Spanish original, it fails in every respect. For one, it's too dark and the camera work is too shaky, meaning that much of the zombie action is impossible to make out. REC was just as dark and also shot on hand-held cameras, yet you could make out every single shot thanks to the time and effort having gone into its undertaking.The cast is also very poor with the actors lacking the naturalism of their Spanish counterparts. I recognised Jay Hernandez from HOSTEL, but he seems uncomfortable with the format and unsure of himself ? and it's not just his character, either. The lead, Jennifer Carpenter (THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE) is horrible and encouraged to screech, scream, shout and hyperventilate for almost all of the latter half of the movie, making her one of the most infuriating leads in a horror film ever. Inevitably, the gore and disgust factor is unnecessarily upped ? these zombies are more gooey and have legs that break off ? yet the genuine power of the original is nowhere to be found.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quarantine starts as a reporter named Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) for the television show 'Night Shift' is assigned to spend a night with the Los Angeles fire department as part of a story, along with her cameraman Scott Percival (Steve Harris) they are paired up with firefighters Jake (Jay Hernandez) &amp; George (Johnathon Schaech) who are called out to an emergency. Angela &amp; Scott shadow them to a four storey apartment block where strange noises have been heard in one of the apartments belonging to an elderly woman named Espinoza, breaking the door down the fire &amp; police crews discover her standing there, blood stained &amp; frothing at the mouth. Espinoza attacks one of the cops &amp; bites his neck, in a panic the other's try to leave the building for proper help but find that the authorities outside have seal all exits &amp; declared the apartment block a quarantine zone. Those still trapped inside soon find out that a mutant strain of rabies is turning people in flesh-eating zombies...Written &amp; directed by brother's John Erick Dowdle &amp; Drew Dowdle this is the US remake of a Spanish film called Rec (2007) which seems to have a lot of fans whom seem to dislike this remake, judging by a lot of the negative comments &amp; reviews this dislike seems to stem almost entirely from the fact that Quarantine is a remake without acknowledging anything else. I will admit straight away that I have never seen Rec so cannot compare the two, maybe because I haven't seen it means I have no expectation whatsoever &amp; therefore ended up enjoying Quarantine substantially more than I expected to. I think the script is pretty good, there's a little bit of humour &amp; character development at the start before the main story kicks in but once it does kick in the script is fairly blunt with people forgetting things like manners or reciting some lengthy back-story which is actually pretty believable in the situation. I mean if you found yourself trapped inside an infected building would you waste time telling some distant insignificant story from your past? Would you really care if no-one else there liked you? The script gives us just about enough information to care when all hell starts to break loose, people start arguing &amp; the relationship's start to fall apart. There's clichéd romance, no happy ending for anyone &amp; just about enough ambiguity to keep things mysterious with just enough pieces of the puzzle revealed for the audience to fit together &amp; make sense of what's going on. At just under 90 minutes in length the found footage nature of the narrative is nicely done &amp; it moves along at a good pace with the film becoming more frantic &amp; darker as it progresses, Quarantine is a sort of mix of The Blair Witch Project (1999) &amp; 28 Days Later... (2002) in both story &amp; style.Despite not usually liking the shaky hand-held camcorder way of shooting a film I thought it worked well in Quarantine, even though it can get a bit shaky &amp; blurred at times I always knew what was going on unlike a lot of films which mix shaky camera footage &amp; fast editing which is a real no no in my book as it just ends up annoying. The attack scenes are quick &amp; effective, there's some decent gore here with a splattered Rat, various bites &amp; gushing blood, a drill in someone's head &amp; a guy trying to walk on a broken leg with his bones sticking out of the flesh in what must have been very painful. I felt the director did a great job in building up the tension &amp; suspense here, the shaky camera-work also gets across the sort of panic, confusion &amp; fear that would have been present.With a supposed budget of about $12,000,000 this looks fine with good production values &amp; effects, unusually there is no musical score at all. Largely filmed in Los Angeles in California. Production company Verrtigo Films seem to specialise in US remakes of foreign horror with films like The Grudge (2004), Dark Water (2005), The Departed (2006), The Eye (2008), Shutter (2008), The Echo (2008) &amp; The Uninvited (2009). The acting is pretty strong here, Jennifer Carpenter is not only nice to look at but she is quite good as she slowly loses it &amp; by the end becomes a complete wreck.Quarantine turned out a whole lot better than I had expected, it's a pretty effective little scare film that I thought delivered the goods. Not a masterpiece but a good solid horror film anyway, followed by Quarantine 2: Terminal (2011).</fullReview>

I just happened to watch the unofficial sequel, 'Terminal' first. At the very least we had one character survive, and we got to see the final ending of the movie, and were left with no loose ends. Everything was told in black and white, short and sweet. Perfect.Maybe I'm still to novice for horror films, but I always thought it was more proper to have a formal ending. Some kind of resolution, no matter what the odds. That's what I, and another portion of the audience want to see. To me, surviving against the odds is much more intriguing than dying.

They start at the station until the fire alarm goes off and takes them to an apartment building. While there they soon discover why they were called there. An infection has spread through the building infecting many of the residents. They try to leave but the CDC seals off and quarantines the building.This movie was OK it just was not as good as REC. Its funny the difference between American horror movies and Spanish ones. You can really tell the difference in the cultures. Although this movie is pretty much the same it does not have as many scary moments and not as good of acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SOMEWHAT (barely) SPOILSH! Quarantine is quite a mediocre film. Any story with a depth that could have been presented was only hinted at,for which is the reason I give this movie a 4 rather then a 3. It follows in the footprints of modern films (especially modern horror films)and does not offer anything new or original,but it does attempt to keep the story as realistic as possible. The virus is in fact a from of evolved rabies which the movie presents like the viewer couldn't have figured it out from the first "scary" scene. It is barely scary until the last 15-20 minutes. You will most likely try your best to keep awake until then. As I said,this evolved virus reminds the viewer of the (however unlikely) possibility of such a situation... the problem with THIS is that whoever wrote it was unsure if it would be better to make it paranormal or just a plain virus... like every infected was aware that there was a movie being shot and they had to be as scary as possible. Perhaps that is just why I dislike it... the movie tries so hard that you just end up not buying it. If you like the Blair witch-filming-style combined with a witless plot about witless infected screaming unnaturally at every corner that the main characters turn, you will probably like the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was OK at first. Yes, there's flaws. And yes, there's some points which are not "realistic" (for this kind of movie it's a must...). Actually it's quite entertaining. Except two things. If a woman is hysterical and a man is not, then it's the man's duty to slap that woman to face to stop that hysterically screaming. It REALLY spoils the feeling for the end part of the film. The second thing is, that at the attic, in the dark, if you have a camera with night vision, and you're not keeping your eye on the ocular, you should be able to see that faint lightglow from the camera (the creature should see it). And besides, is there any camera without ANY function lights? Besides these two flaws, it was quite nice film - not a horror movie, but a thriller (and a comedy) and I really didn't feel wasting my time by watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Horror Never Fails To Disappoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See the thing that always amazed me about the Evil Dead series was how different it was from the rest, which is why it has left such a mark on the horror genre with each film. This movie was packed with so many clichés I was literally waiting for Bruce Campbell to jump out any minute with his boomstick and show them all how it's done. Alas, he never came. When it comes to horror I generally look for one of two things: For the movie to be enjoyably fun, or actually scary and coherent. That of course, and other specific qualities along with them. To elaborate, I'll simply walk through what this movie lacked.Memorable characters for one; I left the movie not remembering a single one. The attempt was to create a sense of realism, and yet it's so full of clichés it doesn't matter just how much the camera shakes. It's fairly obvious who's going to die and when, not to mention how, so it starts off sort of funny to scoff at but quickly grows boring. I cringed here or there, but terror was not the feeling I got as I watched this. None of the characters, despite being well acted for the most part, act logically at all despite the attempt and sheer focus on making it realistic. Oh yeah, and as a shock ending Smeagol is hiding in the attic laboratory., whoop tee doo. The odd thing, as with all foreign horror film re-makes, people claim the original is better. But see the thing is that if these re-makes are literally made shot for shot, line for line, then I don't think I would've been all too impressed either way. The same goes for crap like "The Uninvited", and vice versa for incredibly good horror films like "Funny Games". "Quarantine" just doesn't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie thinking it would be decent at the very least, at first I hesitated (with all these Horror movie wannabes who wouldn't ). I must say, the only movie in the 21st century that I found worthy to be called a horror movie, "The Wolfman" from 2010.Now, Quarantine has so many inconsistencies, it will make you say things like; "Why did that guy just walk right up to that infected girl?" or just say "What the hell is going on!"Seriously, the plot makes no mention of the virus or how it came to the city or why it was created or how it was created.And speaking of the first half, why send a bunch of Fire-Fighters to a building where they would be slaughtered, there is NO FIRE THERE!And the virus itself just sucks and the explanation was awful. Its like the movie wanted to be a zombie movie, well its not, its a wannabe zombie movie.And the characters are idiots, there is a grandma with weird teeth and blood dripping off them, and what does a character do? Walks right up to her! Then they finally come to their senses and just shoot her, after she attacked a guy like two times.Oh look! There is a girl with pale skin and blood dripping from her mouth, lets just walk right up to her and try to take her to the "nursery"! IDIOTS!And that happens after they encounter like five infected people. WALKING UP TO A DANGEROUS THING THAT WILL EITHER KILL YOU OR INFECT YOU IS NOT A GOOD IDEA! And yet it happens like four times!And the only mention of the wannabe virus's origin is a very brief one at the end. When they are in the basement, they see papers saying stuff like "Doom virus" and stuff, and thats it. Yes, that is it.And the quality of it, don't get me started, these movies with one camera and shaky filming are too repetitive and are awful if they are not well done."Best horror movie this year", I think not. How can you say that to a movie that is not even a horror movie, or not even worthy to be called a movie at all.I give it a 1/10, because that is the lowest score I can give If I could give a 0, I would</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nice remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmmmmmmm, it's hard to review this US remake of REC. Why you ask, well, if you have watched REC (the original Spanish flick) then you know what you will get. Still, the original is better, more scary but don't think that this doesn't work, it's also scary but it takes a bit longer before things really starts. Jennifer carpenter of Dexter fame gives a good performance and is believable. The funny thing is that sometimes you know what you will get due the reason that they just took the scary parts out of the original and remade it in theirs. It is also a bit on the gory side and not for the squeamish. I haven't seen any film from director John Erick Dowdle made earlier than Quarantine but I have seen his follow up "Devil", and it is surely a director to watch out for in the horror genre. I surely recommend this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quarantine...somewhat entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine, the remake of Rec: Before you go and see this movie I must ask the question first. Do you know that this is a remake of a very scarier and superior film Rec? If not, think about checking that one out first before seeing this. Yeah if you don't speak Spanish you'll have to read the subtitles but I assure you, you'll be thankful to see that one before seeing this.My Review: With that said, here is my review on Quarantine. I'm a big zombie/infection fan, and this set up of a virus in a sealed off building seen through first person and presented as reality seems like one hell of a good idea. Sadly, the film just kind of gets dull for me. My biggest problem is the acting. It feels like actors pretending to act like it's real. From little things like the camera man stepping into the frame to fix the documentary type host's hair to the delivery of lines that try to hard to sound improvised, the movie seems to try TOO hard to be real. Some of the edits in the film, which I found out from the commentary, are pretty amazing because what seems like one shot may in fact be three of four spliced together. But some of these splices just remind me that this is a movie, and it takes away from enjoying the film. An example of this would be the camera moving around all crazy, then suddenly coming into a close up of someone getting eaten oh so perfectly, then moving away to becoming all shaky again. Everyone just seemed to be trying too hard to be like, "This is so real". The infected themselves look kind of scary, and people's reaction to the build up of deaths in the building in no way seem real?.again I go back to the realism, lol?but it's not just that. The movie almost seemed like they were trying to out do the movie they were based on, and just because you have an American cast with Hollywood backing you up, doesn't mean you're going to come out with a better product. It's hard not to compare the two films, but where Quarantine failed, Rec succeeds. I never care about the characters in Quarantine, the story seems to sort of go nowhere, and the scares aren't so scare nor is the infected whereas in Rec, the characters are instantly care for because of the realism behind them, the story moves at a good pace, and there are scares thrills and the infected are scary as hell. Quarantine is an okay movie but I highly recommend you see Rec first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment....even for a zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of terrible zombie films in my time, but this one was by far the worst. I will acknowledge the fact that being quarantined in an apartment building does not leave a lot of room for exploration but a lot more could have been done than actually was. The only bit that really made me jump came about 5 minutes before the end, but aside from that, the acting was weak, especially the lead's performance and the setting was too dark for my tastes. The only good thing I can really say about this film is I enjoyed the way people were zombified, but if you like a zombie film that's gory, suspenseful or makes you jump, then this isn't the one I would recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow poor Jennifer Carpenter, once again she's fighting for her life and end up hitting the floor. Well, "Quarantine" is another documentary-movie which leads us to believe it really happened. It almost did its job, but this technique has been used in lots of movies since "Blair Witch Project", so it's no longer an innovation. Despite that, I thought this was entertaining, the cast was very professional and did all they could to make it all look real. Also, the movie showed a society that didn't care for human rights or for people who weren't infected, it seemed they just cared for they own health and no importance for the human rights (and for them humans locked up there). A must see for those who aren't whacked of this kind of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original Rec: which I thought was only OK anyway...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this brief, this was the inevitable US made remake of a vaguely successful horror movie. In this case the horror movie was the Spanish film Rec that came out a few years ago and achieved some notoriety for being (supposedly) original and ferociously scary. After watching it I chose to disagree, I found it only OK and nothing special. Quarantine turns out to be pretty much a lazy carbon copy, only in a more acceptable language, cos I guess all that readin' in a film can get tedious hey Uncle Sam?So rather than go into the plot, which you can see above, I'll try to point out some of the reasons this is worse. Let's see, it is more obvious, there is some cheesy flirting and a crappy supposed joke with off-mike bravado being picked up, they tried to make the reason for the virus more apparent so they come up with a crappy cause, (which doesn't for a second explain the finale by the way and falls apart under scrutiny), and lastly there is more gore throughout with less time for scares, so the events are less impactful. Got it? So now don't need to watch it. Final Rating ? 5 / 10. If you must see one and can't choose, see Rec: If you don't like readin' watch Quarantine. If you like good movies, especially horror movies, watch neither.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining as a standalone film but pale comparison to Rec</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A television reporter and her cameraman are on call with a group of fireman. When they are called to an apartment building their night takes a turn for the worse? The building becomes quarantined confining them with the inhabitants who are infected by a virus that turns them into bloodthirsty killers.If you've seen Rec (2007) this version adds nothing new. Director John Erick Dowdle and writer Drew Dowdle can't fail as it's almost a paint by number remake, only with English dialogue instead of the dubbed or subtitles of the original.While Hostel's Jay Hernandez give a great performance, the majority of the rest of the cast are less convincing. Quarantine it's a lot sleeker in it's execution and looks really good. That said, the griminess of REC has been lost and this version sadly loses the raw innate fear factor.As a standalone point of view shot film it's entertaining enough. Blood, gore, tension and claustrophobia but if you've seen the original it's an unnecessary remake and cash-in on Rec (2007) made less than a year earlier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies Not So Slow in Quarantine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(originally appeared in Free Times, Columbia's entertainment guide)Even though I'm fascinated by the "living dead" genre as a metaphor for the end of civilization -- which, judging by the financial crisis, is next week -- there's too many of the things. What can they say that we haven't already heard? Quarantine takes an idea that's been beat to undeath and does a damn scary job of it, emulating the documentary "you are there" feel of Cloverfield, the same approach as last year's Diary of the Dead, by zombie inventor George Romero. Sorry, George, but Quarantine is the better cinematic treatment, in that it's less self-conscious. George's characters, film students, wax poetic about the relationship between violence and film, whereas director John Erick Dowdle's characters are too busy running from zombies to intellectualize. Or are they? Zombies, I mean.Technically, the creatures in Quarantine aren't actually dead, but if it has a glassy stare like a zombie, moans like a zombie, eats the flesh of the living like a zombie, in my book, it's a zombie. Dowdle's in the same denial about his film being a living dead movie as Danny Boyle when he made 28 Days Later.But Dowdle hooked me with a brilliant set-up: A newslady played by Jennifer Carpenter (The Exorcism of Emily Rose), shooting a feature story about the fire department, playfully flirts with the firefighters as she tours their station. I've shot half a dozen TV stories just like it, and everything rings so authentic about an unrehearsed location shoot that it's a perfect lead-in to the terrifying events that follow, as she accompanies them on what they believe to be a routine medical call. When they get to a downtown apartment building, Dowdle stages an elaborate introductory sequence, which appears to be a single take, that rapidly demonstrates that the call is anything but routine. The chilling unpredictability coupled with the nauseating "bounce" of the hand-held camera renders Quarantine mighty scary.There's only one thing I don't like, and READ NO FURTHER if you don't want to know. It has nothing to do with the film; it's the trailer, which contains a shot that I thought when I saw it, "That couldn't be the last shot in the movie...could it?" Unbelievably, it could. Dowdle ought to be livid at the marketing flaks who thought it was a brilliant idea to telegraph the ending of a suspense thriller.If you can ignore that, which is an awfully tall order, Quarantine is a supremely creepy Halloween entry that examines, in microcosm, how Americans react in a disaster. It's not encouraging, but it's a well-directed film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's nothing too original but it's still a lot of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the "Blair Witch Project" first came out, the use of a first person perspective has become wildly popular in horror movies over the years. "Quarantine" is no different. A remake of the Spanish film, "Rec", the movie follows a group of people trapped inside an L.A. apartment building trying to survive a very contagious, mutated form of rabies that starts to infect people one by one. The film does have a lot going for it. The actors, especially Jennifer Carpenter, are all very good and keep the viewer entertained, even though most of what they do is running and screaming. The infected (basically fast zombies) are also quite frightening and believable as rabies and it's symptoms are very real. There's also enough action and blood to satisfy any horror fan. Some of the death scenes in particular are really cool (my personal favorite involves using the camera itself to kill a zombie). My only real beef with this film is it's first ten minutes of buildup. It's very boring and could've definitely been shortened. Overall, while it may be seen as kind of lazy to remake a movie that came out in 2007, there's enough original twists and perks in it to have it stand out. This is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie back in 2008, but when I found out it was a remake I had to see which one was better. The original "REC" was amazing, there was nothing wrong with it in my opinion. After watching REC, I got a chance to watch Quarantine and let me say it wasn't bad at all. The only flaw about Quarantine was that it was a copy cat, not a remake but a copy cat. Usually remakes have some parts that weren't in the original. The only part that was added in Quarantine from REC was that there were elevators in the apartment. Another thing that I didn't like about Quarantine was that Jennifer Carpenter is a little bit annoying. Her acting reminded me of The Exorcist of Emily Rose. Quarantine wasn't bad at all, it wasn't awful, but it wasn't the best movie ever and I am really looking forward for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern must-see for horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of a Spanish horror film, Quarantine is gripping, claustrophobic and scary as all get out. It's also one of the few movies of its kind that won't make you vomit?but I'll get to that later.Angela Videll (Jennifer Carpenter) is a pretty young reporter who works for a Los Angeles-based infotainment show called "The Night Shift". While doing a story about a life at a fire house one night, Angela and her cameraman Scott Percival get to go along on an emergency call. Trailing after two firefighters named Jake and Fletcher (Jay Hernandez and Johnathon Schaech), they arrive at an old, four-story apartment building to check on reports of a screaming old woman. Joined by a pair of cops, Angela, Scott, Jake and Fletcher head up to the old woman's apartment. They find the old woman foaming at the mouth and with blood on her nightgown that doesn't appear to be hers. They try to help here, but then the old woman attacks one of the cops and bites off a hunk of flesh from his neck. There's something in the building that's changing people into animalistic monsters. But when Angela and company try to flee, they discover something even more terrifying. The building has been surrounded by soldiers and they won't let anyone get out.This is one of the better horror movies that I've seen, largely because it manages to be frightening and shocking on more than one level. There's the thrilling fear of having to dodge crazed cannibals mixed with the anxiety of the unknown, the dread of impending doom and the panic of helplessness. In some ways, when these characters realize they're being abandoned to their fate by their own government, that's even worse than what's trying to eat them alive.Now, Quarantine may have a great concept and be very well-executed, but it's still a fairly straight forward horror flick. So, there's not exactly a lot of brilliant dialog or characterization on display here. The stuff with Angela and the firefighters before they get the emergency call, however, is better than the usual set up these kind of films have. Like most really good horror movies, it doesn't act like a horror movie until people start getting chomped on. It also explains what's happening to the audience with a minimum of clunky exposition and does a great job of slowly and believably ratcheting up the fear and danger until it reaches near-hysteria at the story's climax.And about that non-vomiting business? Quarantine is shot real-video style like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield. Everything we see is through the lens of Scott, Angela's cameraman. Unlike most real-video movies, I was able to get through this one without feeling a hint of motion sickness. Because the conceit of the movie is that it's being shot by a professional cameraman, there's a lot less of that shaky, jerky camera movement that makes some folks want to hurl. It still looks like real-video footage, but not like it was filmed by a drunk guy at a wedding in Afghanistan. So, if you want to experience real-video storytelling without having to worry about the old Technicolor yawn, Quarantine is the movie you've been waiting for. Director John Erick Dowdle also manages to do some things with this style of filmmaking that you probably haven't seen before, using the camera's point of view to maximize the shock and horror before your eyes.Quarantine is a compelling story told very well. It's one of the few modern horror films that all fans of the genre ought to see. And even if you're not necessarily a big horror fan, this movie is just plain good enough to entertain anybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been wanting to check this one out for quite some time and I finally got the time to sit down and watch it. I wasn't expecting greatness, but I got a lot more out of it than what I was expecting. This movie actually made me SCARED. I haven't had a horror movie do that to me in quite some time. It was very suspenseful, and I constantly had butterflies or whatever you will call them, in my stomach. The gore was satisfying and not over the top; it made it feel realistic. The acting was pretty superb for a horror movie, usually they scream once and then just stay nervous but here they were having breakdowns and it was great. The only problems with the movie were the annoying camera angles (sometimes it was zoomed in at awkward places and it got blurry often) and the lazy and sloppy ending. It felt just thrown together at the last minute. It didn't make much sense and it was dissatisfying to me. If you're in the mood to actually be scared again, then this movie is for you.

So I rented it to compare the two. As lots have said, its almost identical, bar the language of course...But for me the original had way more going for it. On the surface, you can't tell them apart, but the hidden tension and more genuine fear of the characters in rec makes for a more unnerving and ultimately enjoyable experience. Perhaps its because I knew what was coming, I just didn't feel it as much with Quarantine. It's definitely a decent film worth watching, with plenty of jumps and hair raising moments, but if you haven't already, watch rec instead, it's better...</fullReview>

In the dark with just the camera light things either went by too fast or there was ever more shots into darkness.....That's the bad aspect of the film.The good aspect of the film was that the last 45 minutes or so really did get intense and kept me chewing the hell out of a couple tooth picks.

		<fullReview>For its genre, zombie horror I guess, what there was of it was quite well done. And Dexter's sister was great. But "everyone dies, apparently," is not a satisfactory conclusion, for me. And it is more than a little odd that the final shot of the film is given away in the teasers, trailers and poster. I expected that shot to be somewhere early in the second act, as in, 'holy crap, this is getting serious.' But no, that's the final shot. Everyone else has already been killed or bitten, except for her, and she gets dragged out by the uberzombie in the attic - cut to black, roll credits. Weak.I never saw the original, but since this was apparently a shot for shot re-make, I'd have the same problem with that. Perhaps there will be a sequel and we'll more story there, but I don't quite see it. What I believe is that the writers had an relatively original idea as to how some zombies might originate, but did not have the brainpower either to truly work out the details, and so left them muddy, or to imagine a third act, and so ended it at two. For that matter, I'm not sure that it wasn't all just one long first act, with an inciting incident 30 minutes in.</fullReview>

It stands out also for being one of the rare times when a remake is a lot of improvement over the original movie. Don't get me wrong, the original is not a bad small movie, but it just isn't crafted that great. This is one is.

		<shortDescription>Not believable at all....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically it represents 89 mins. of my life that I'm not getting back and were regretfully wasted.Almost all the characters make illogical and idiotic decisions while acting completely irrational given any of the different situations they encounter. Once again it is very hard to accept, or rationalize, anything these people and or professionals are doing.It is also absurd to persuade the viewer into believing that the CDC or any other related agency could utterly block all cellular reception down to a single specific location. What?...seriously? OK perhaps by disabling the necessary satellite(s) themselves, but that would also disable their very own communications since they are at the targeted location.The other major problem is just how quickly this quarantine takes place. The key emergency teams ie: Police, Firefighters? etc. were only in the building for a matter of minutes, and had not even reported to any other authority as to just what the situation was, before the ridiculously impetuous and unrealistic quarantine was put into effect.I could go on and on, but what's the point?Do yourself a favor and heed my warning, this movie is sooo bad that it will actually begin to irritate you, in an unbearable and maddening sense, all within less than 30 mins. which makes it very hard to even finish the film in my opinion.So if you dare watch the first 30 mins. only to feel the same as I do, then save yourself the other 59 mins. and do something sensible with your time...perhaps watch a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In contrast to recent Times Square Car Bomb plot (May 2010) - this movie is paltry faked fright scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Movie QUARANTINE has a gimmick -- that of a local news team going on a kind of "embed" (fully approved following around and miking the firemen/EMTs) for a rescue intervention to a multi-floor apartment that has a cross-section of the sick and dying and infected. Once the people who have been given a case of the "rage" (see the much better 28_DAYS_LATER) emerge from the shadows and begin to attack/bite and kill the hapless victims in their paths, the film is on its quite predictable if horrifying path of gross-out effects that are not at all given any kind of framework for viewers to see and to care even a little bit. In this first week of May 2010, there was a much more gripping actual event that could have been an urban event of gigantic mayhem and destruction/killing. That car bomb that was luckily spotted and kept harmless however was still a chilling example of the kind of real-world scenario that makes us all glad of the first responders and the law enforcement who do have people's lives, liberties, and pursuit of happiness in mind.Do not - repeat Don't - borrow this film nor buy it; spend your time with learning about Field Emergency First Aid and keeping one's neighbor safe from infection and the spread of real-world plagues like MRSA and other non-antibiotic-responding infections. It will be a greater use that may help/educate you with aiding your fellow human beings -- unlike this Zombie-exploitation "B" movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even like horror movies. Scratch that. I actually would watch more horror movies save for the fact that the majority of them are borderline atrocious. I'm pretty sure the last one I enjoyed was the original Saw. Before that it might have been the Scream series, I'm that disinterested in this genre.Quarantine wasn't as good as the movies I mentioned above, and it's not very close either. At the same time I went into it with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised it was actually worth seeing once. The story is typical (spin the zombie formula a little bit so it appears to be original when in fact it's just an excuse to have people act like zombies) but the movie moves swiftly at only 89 minutes. The scares are surprising enough to keep you on your toes but nothing that overly sensitive people would find jarring. The only thing that bugged me was the over the top use of the shaky cam, which I thought would be extinct by now. I guess I didn't mind seeing it because it didn't try to be something it wasn't. There wasn't an obligatory length of 2 hours, the scares weren't off the charts but sufficient, and the actors aren't going to win any awards any time soon but they were pretty convincing overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another remake, not original, but worth a look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As mentioned in other reviews this is a close remake of the Spanish Rec almost scene for scene. Overall the cast performance was strong, although don't expect to get to know much about any of the characters. The movie shot well, primarily in semi-darkness with the fixed light of the documentary style camera in the storyline illuminating most of the scenes. Jennifer Carpenter was convincing although her constant shrill screaming toward the end got distracting from what was going on and was in contrast to the surprisingly calm and collected attitude of her accompanying cameraman. The final scenes were very reminiscent of the way the blair witch project movie was shot All in all a good view with good jump in the seat moments, don't expect anything different from the general modern mass zombie/mystery viral cannibalism genre thats going around these days. 7.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright...But I've Seen It Before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you didn't know, Quarantine, starring Jennifer Carpenter from "Dexter," is based off the Spanish horror film REC. The great thing about REC was that it felt real, even though it was a "zombie" flick, just because it was shot like Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, both great films. It was true horror and not that nonsense we see in a lot of the horror films that come out nowadays that show how much of a stupid society we are becoming as Americans.I was not looking forward to Quarantine because of a fear of mine: This is a remake, and it looks like REC, but in English. Unfortunately that came true.This is not even a bad movie. Not at all. It still scares you, even with the same scares, and it doesn't do anything wrong except....it's the same thing. I was watching REC while watching Quarantine and vice versa. It was the same thing and yet it never added up to the level of greatness that REC had.And sometimes when they did make changes it didn't work. For example, the cameraman in REC never shows his face, and that adds to the illusion of the character. But in Quarantine, first shot of the freaking movie, he walks out from behind the camera to fix the girl's hair. For one thing, it ruins your imagination, and two, it just feels like the director's had to make an excuse to get the guy on screen.There are some things that I did like about this film though. In the original REC, while the police were there you never saw what would happen if someone tried to escape. In Quarantine, things that weren't shown in REC are placed in Quarantine and that makes the film in some ways scarier. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's a better movie.My overall verdict, go watch the original version. But if you are like a lot of people out there who refuse to watch subtitled films, check this one out instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Jennifer Carpenter playing the lead lady had to give one of the worst acting performances I have ever seen. This movie had nothing going for it. It robbed from 'The Blair Witch Project' and resulted in this dung. Basically , this is a film about a very amateurish journalist couple , most likely college project, doing a documentary of the firefighter craft in L.A. The carefree, smart alecky , journalist goes from annoying to even more annoying in about 3 seconds flat, with the call to a building invaded by biologically altered humans, translation another zombielike flick. Being quarantined , inside this apartment building, basically the film consists of trying to find ways out before falling victim to these mutants and risk becoming one. The film had horrible acting, as stated with screams that could not have been rehearsed. At least thats how it seemed. Movie was basically dark and it was hard to see what was going on. Nothing original, nothing earth shattering and just no one to truly root for. This was pure trash and I think I should sue to get paid minimum wage for sitting thru this flick. A very vague , uninteresting finale, put a bow on this movie as possibly being one of the worst horror films of all time. Not much in the way of graphics. Just blasé with the biggest shock being how awful this film was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of people are trapped in a building as a deadly virus spreads among them. That's all I have to say about that.I watched the original Spanish version of this story, titled REC without knowing a single thing about it. It was one of the most satisfying movie experiences I've ever had. Unfortunately, you can't relive something like that.Quarantine is extremely faithful to REC--so much so that there really weren't any surprises for those who saw the original. In some ways, I appreciated the faithfulness--it looked like they could have been in the EXACT same apartment building as the Spanish-set story. On the other hand, watching this was pretty much just like re-watching REC with different actors. I prefer the girl in REC. Much cuter.If you go in fresh, I imagine this movie could be just as exhilarating as my first experience with REC--it builds the same way, has pretty much all the same surprises. It really is an unusual occurrence that a Hollywood remake doesn't suck the greatness out of well-done original. At the same time, Quarantine doesn't really add anything new. It's pretty much just the same. And why would you need two of the same?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninteresting horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm afraid I haven't seen Rec as the above reviewer so I have to judge this movie as a stand alone.This horror movie is the archetype of what's wrong with the horror genre nowadays. I'll list some of the problems with this movie.1. Idiot characters: If someone with bloodshot eyes, incomprehensible speech and blood soaked clothes gnarls at me, I would either put IT down or run away. Here in this movie the characters stay shouting "Stop and freeze" and then get bitten.2. No Suspense: I don't call appearing "zombies" out of nowhere or illogical places scary, they are just gratuitous scares that the movie maker uses.3. No story whatsoever: Okay, now this is a tricky one. Of course one could say, why do you need a story in a horror movie, it's all about the scares and suspense. That would be true if the latter were in the movie. This however, as stated above, is not the case so then I want some story to at least keep me going. Again the movie fails to deliver.4. Ending. This must be the dumbest ending I have ever seen. This is the reverse of a deus ex machina, and I would like to call it diabolus ex machina if you can forgive me the bad analogy.So to end I'd like to state that this horror movie is up to par with Uwe Boll's crap, Amusement, and I'm sure you can add countless more to this list. Apparently I've blocked out older experiences of bad movies.Stay away from this, or lose precious hours of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A severely clichéd, yet guilty pleasure of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well think of a less shaky cam Cloverfield with a 28 days later kind of infection with a Blair Witch conclusion. Yes, Quarantine is utterly unoriginal however does provide some cheap entertainment to fans of the horror genre. So the basic synopsis is this, a reporter and her cameraman pay a visit to the Los Angeles fire department to do a news story. This first quarter of the film is similar in form to Cloverfield and Blair Witch as it is more upbeat and provides menial conversations and dialogue that has nothing to do with what's to come. Suddenly a call comes in for medical attention at an apartment complex in the area. As soon as the Firefighters and News pair arrive we see the distressed residents of the complex complaining about a loud scream heard from an older, reclusive woman's room. The two police officers, firefighters and news team investigate to see the woman growling and drooling with blood on her dress (think of one of the infected from 28 days later). She attacks one of the police officers and soon another firefighter. After that the people soon realize that they have been quarantined in the complex and little by little are attacked and infected. I won't spoil any more but the last 30 minutes are easily the movies best because the tension is kept up throughout and Jennifer Carpenter (the lead actress) has a believable tensity to her. Finally despite it's number of clichés, almost shamelessly so in its ending. It is literally almost the same thing as Blair Witch. The film is still entertaining if you can at least partially ignore the similarities between the mentioned films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following a group of firefighters &amp; police into an apartment complex after receiving a call that an elderly woman was heard screaming in her home &amp; may have plummeted to her death, a wannabe female reporter &amp; her camera man discover a deadly virus has changed the old lady into a flesh craving fiend who quickly spreads her creepy cooties to other tenants who soon turn into mindless animalistic killers themselves. With the building sealed off &amp; no one allowed to get out unless they get blown away by the army &amp; health units. The people trapped inside are forced to fight for their lives &amp; find a way to escape their horrible fate. American remake of the truly awesome REC, pulls a PSYCHO 98' &amp; instead of doing anything new with the project, remakes the entire film shot for shot with the odd thing changed here &amp; there &amp; while I love QUARANTINE just as much as REC, I didn't have the same amount of fun &amp; the chills &amp; suspense just wasn't there due to the fact that it was a shot for shot remake, I knew who was going to get it &amp; how, nonetheless unlike most American remakes of really good scary foreign horror films, QUARANTINE manages to boast good acting &amp; directing &amp; should provide a chill or two for those who have no seen REC. Highly recommended, but the direct to DVD sequel (which is not a remake of REC 2) is better, called naturally, QUARINTINE 2**** stars</fullReview>

But even though she was a great actor, the movie itself was just okay.I have never seen "REC" so I cannot compare it to the original.I am not a huge fan of the camera technique. It doesn't make me sick or anything, it can just be hard to watch sometimes. What I didn't like was the fact that it was SO dark. You couldn't see what was going on. I know they mean that to be suspenseful but it just became really hard to watch.

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. I am a huge fan of zombie films and am willing to accept most interpretations of zombies and how an epidemic of the undead starts and spreads.The story is a good one and the single camera style could have worked but it didn't. The lighting and the camera angles were just bad decisions on the director's part and the camera it's self just didn't seemed to have a good picture. What was with the focusing in and out? I could not tell what was going on most of the time and at points I had to look away from the screen because my inner ear started telling my brain that I was on the Gravitron at the state fair. Late in the movie they decided that it would be a good idea if the camera light would start going out at random times and that was way over the top. When you are making a movie in this style, (shot from one cameras view) you must strike a balance between ease of view and having a realistic feel. This movie failed to do that. I appreciate the realism they tried to put in to this film but it would have done a lot better with out the focus and lighting issues.Full disclosure; I have seen REC and loved it. I watched REC with no subtitles and had no idea what anyone was saying and it is still better than Quarantine. I am from the US and I was pulling for Quarantine to be at least as good as REC but it fell far short. If you have seen one there is no point in seeing the other because the story is pretty much the same but if you haven't seen either and you have a choice see REC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Quarantine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call it a case of deliberately engineered deja-vu, that I consciously decided to sit through this American remake of the recently screened Spanish horror film REC. Well of course the purpose is to discover if what's essentially the same story and technique employed, could get screwed up in a remake, given that Hollywood more often than not, lets down the original brilliance which they think they can replicate easily to translate to box office dollars.So what's the verdict? If you've already watched REC, then this one just simply pales in comparison, because of the need to be verbatim, and somehow the filmmakers here found it necessary to tell you every now and then, that there's actually someone behind the camera. Scott the cameraman (Steve Harris) appears quite often in front of the camera, well, and actually does so from the onset. Also, to up the body count quotient, new characters were included (although supporting ones), and unlike the original which had an opening scene dedicated to the fire station filled with more meat, here it drones on and on at how the assigned firemen are getting the hots for reporter Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter).The storyline's almost the same, save for a few more extra scenes included to jazz up the gore department, and to incorporate some additional action elements. Otherwise, there's plenty of overacting here by everyone, so much so that instead of rooting for the characters to get out of their predicament, you're more likely to find yourself wishing that they meet their demise soon enough. Such is the original essence lost, and with that, what primarily works in REC.Between the two Angela Vidals, I'd confess that Jennifer Carpenter can't hold a candle to Manuela Velasco. The latter's the sweet damsel you'll risk life and limb to save, whereas the former, well, you'd just wish that she shuts the hell up and stop barking orders. I guess the direction of John Erick Dowdle will have take responsibility for that not-too-subtle difference between the Vidals. And through this film I'd learnt to appreciate how the shaky-cam was used to great effect in REC, and how easy it is to lapse into pitfalls as in Quarantine. Same storyline and plot development, same technique, relatively the same type of characters, but totally different outcomes in terms of how it engages the audience, because there were crucial moments where it failed to understand the need for restraint.Sure you can't expect rocket science to be coming out of this film, but unfortunately it joins the pile of "remakes that don't make it". Word is REC2 is currently in production, so I'll be looking forward to that, and hoping that there won't be a Quarantine 2 to embarrass itself.</fullReview>

The acting was alright, although the reporter gets a little annoying at the end with her screaming and heavy breathing.

		<fullReview>I had no interest in this movie (I am not a horror movie fan) until a few women, who do not know each other, described Carpenter's performance almost with identical praise. They were floored by the fact that they themselves could almost feel the horror that the character was going through. Carpenter, with her unique beauty, starts off the role with the same goofy, tomboyish awkwardness that she pulls off so well in Dexter. It isn't until the intensity level increases that her character devolves into a trembling, gasping, heart pounding strait-jacket candidate. I loved it. Now if you think this is high praise for over-acting then I'll assume one of the following: 1)You Are Lara Logan B)You Know Lara Logan III)You Are Lara Logan's husband.I, on the other hand, am married to the Carpenter's "Angela" type of character and unless you know a women who could become absolutely unhinged with fear than I don't think you can fully appreciate this performance.As I stated earlier, I am no horror fan. Although I'm not the kind of guy who counts how many bullets were fired and how many should be left I will mutter "gimme a break" under my breath every so often. However, this movie requires no greater stretch of the imagination than other movies of it's kind and is well worth the watch for Carpenter's performance alone.</fullReview>

If she have seen "REC", she is acting really bad trying to copy Manuela Velasco (The leading actress of "REC"). If she never watch "REC", she's just a really bad actress.

I watched sequences of this movie and I am outraged by the imbecility of American directors. This movie is a copycat of REC, a Spanish production from 2007 that had loads of nominations and wins, it is exactly the same movie but happening in LA, how great is that, the thing about the original movie REC, is that the whole cast was unknown and they did a splendid job, the most known character there was a soap opera queen in Spain. I'd recommend to watch that movie instead of this one, it is the same thing, only much hard work put into it, and it shows.I gave it this rating so that people can see this post, although I don't agree to a 6, maybe a two, no matter how great the movie is, it's just a copycat.Bye, Arthur.</fullReview>

While we know the basic cause of the quarantine, it was unclear how it all started. All of the shots at the firehouse seemed like fluff to add more to the movie.

So last week we went out looking for a movie to watch and we remembered the trailer for quarantine so we decided to go see it.Right from the get go it was kinda hokey. The shaky cam thing just took it over the top. The whole movie was all screaming and spazzing out on the camera. I think when we saw the blair witch project we had enough of the shaky cam garbage. I just want to watch a good old movie rather then them trying to make it look real.. I mean I already know its a movie thats why I went to see it.So other then the shaky cam thing the only reason I rated it higher then a 1 was because of the end scene where the girl gets it. I thought that monster was pretty knarly looking.If they made this movie like a normal one then I think it would have been alright. Because over all there were some great actors, and the story line was pretty good.well thats my thoughts and I hope I don't offend anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quarantine is Hollywood's latest offering of the 'found film' format of horror/suspense, introduced to American audiences by The Blair Witch Project in 1999 and updated with this year's moderately successful Cloverfield, wherein the audience sees only what the character sees through the lens of his own hand-held camera. Based on the highly regarded Spanish film REC of last year, Quarantine is the story of a TV news reporter who finds herself covering a story a lot more horrifying than she anticipated.The film gets off to a slow start, taking its time to introduce the female protagonist, played by Jennifer Carpenter (TV's Dexter), as well as the firefighters she's supposed to be shadowing, including the likable Jay Hernandez (Hostel). While not doing much to endear the viewer to the characters, the opening scenes at least put the audience at ease before plunging everyone headfirst into non-stop zombie mayhem. And not George Romero's shambling undead, either; this film features dozens of sprinting, bloodthirsty, virus-infected creatures popularized by the Dawn of the Dead remake and 28 Days Later.Some of the scares are a little predictable, and the camera-work is needlessly shaky--much like Cloverfield--especially for a supposedly professional camera operator. However, the last half of the movie features pacing that keeps you on the edge of your seat even when the characters find a brief respite from the bloody carnage, and the story provides adequate explanation as to why our heroine runs upstairs instead of out of the zombie-infested apartment building.The acting is decent, and the visual and sound effects are brutal and believable. If you're the kind of person who takes pleasure in watching through the lens of a camera as it is used to beat a zombified woman to death, then this film is a must-see. That said, if you're one of the folks who got motion sickness from watching Cloverfield or the Bourne sequels, you might want to give this one a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hair-Raising Hokum That Hath Little Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine "Cloverfield" taking place in a creepy apartment complex with residents trying to elude zombies rather than in New York City as a "Godzilla" monster tries to stomp them, and you'll have the gist of "Full Moon Rising" director John Erick Dowdle's "Quarantine." Like "Cloverfield," "Quarantine" tells its story from the perspective of a television news videographer. The entire movie is literally seen through the camera viewfinder. This tense, eerie, sometimes exciting epic will only frighten those who have never seen a good zombie movie. What could have been a surefire horror classic is marred by a hammy lead actress and the marginal originality of writer &amp; director John Erick Dowdle and co-scenarist Drew Dowdle's screenplay. The Brothers Dowdle have remade the formulaic Spanish horror thriller "REC" (2007) that co-directors Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza wrote with Luis A. Berdejo. In "REC," a reality TV crew shadows fire department personnel as they fight to free a woman holed up in her apartment. The Dowdle Brothers have taken this bare-bones Spanish supernatural saga and added more zest to their flesh-eating disease chiller, but their low-budget and lack of imagination undermine them in the long run.The Dowdles do a solid job of setting up the premise. Budding TV journalist Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose") and her cameraman Scott (Steve Harris of "Diary of a Mad Black Woman) cover the night shift at a Los Angeles Fire Department station. While they await an inevitable 911 call, fellow firefighters Jake (Jay Hernandez of "Hostel") and George (Johnathon Schaech of "The Doom Generation") bond with the heroine and show her the ropes in what amounts to a variation on the John Travolta movie "Ladder 49." Giddy Angela gets to slide down the fire pole while her poor cameraman records her escapades. These two carefree firefighters compete each other to see who can get Angela in the sack first. Alas, they have forgotten that they are still wearing their microphones from an earlier interview and she can hear them. About a half-an-hour into the action, our heroes get more than they could have imagined in their worst nightmare when they respond to an alarm at an ordinary downtown apartment house. Arriving at the scene, the LAPD accompany our firefighters into the apartment complex and discover an older woman bathed in blood that doesn't look too congenial at first sight. Before our heroes know it, she takes a bite out of them.Later, we learn that one of the residents had taken his infected dog to a veterinarian and the doctor diagnosed a mysterious virus in the canine's system. The LAPD and a crew from the Center for Disease Control surround and seal off the apartment complex. A heavily armed S.W.A.T. team brandishes their assault rifles and threatens to shoot anybody that sets foot outside until their own haz-mat personnel can get inside to examine the bodies. Meanwhile, the firefighters and our heroine struggle to find a way out. Before long they learn from a television broadcast that they don't stand a chance in Hades of getting out alive. Initially, residents who appeared mildly sick begin to mutate into zombies, and our heroine and her cameraman record everything as evidence.Sadly, "Quarantine" suffers from several problems. First, the flighty TV journalist displays an obnoxious penchant for screaming at the least provocation. Furthermore, none of the characters emerge as remotely sympathetic. They are just victims. Second, the Dowdles rely on the first-person point of view of the cameraman to generate thrills and chills. At one point, Scott uses his camera to bludgeon a zombie. Even the other dogs in the building turn into flesh-eaters. However, the filmmakers do nothing with these mutant zombies that horror movie fanatics haven't seen in other films. Third, the authorities don't know how to kill zombies. Fourth, since the zombies never die, they multiply rapidly and munch on the residents as if they were Lays potato chips. For example, a uniformed LAPD officer pours a hail of bullets into the old Hispanic woman and the impact knocks her down. Nevertheless, he doesn't blow her head off, so she gets back up later and keeps on gnawing. Every zombie movie fanatic knows that the only way to kill a zombie is to shoot the sucker in the head. Mind you, the panicky camera work and the claustrophobic apartment complex with its shadowy premises will keep some people poised on the edge of their seats. "Quarantine" knows how to set-up a scary scene, but the pay-off is too predictable to make any of this exercise in helter-skelter chaos seem chilling. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best part of this nail-biter with an ending lifted from "Silence of the Lambs.""Quarantine," if it is any consolation, is a hundred times better than "The Zombie Diaries."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much the same as R.E.C</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw REC a couple of months back and I was impressed. It was the first movie that scared the crap out of me. Something made the movie feel realistic and there was scenes including a lot of panic. I started to recommend this movie to my friends we all agreed on that it was at least the most scary movie we had ever seen. The actors was not performing very well, the character was sometimes unbelievable stupid. But isn't that typical for a horror movie? Anyway, to the main subject, Quarantine. The Hollywood remake of this film. At first when i heard of the movie i thought ''Oh crap, now they are going to ruin this movie'' as they did with ''Shutter'' for example. But it was not as bad as I had expected. It is pretty much the same thing, the characters are looking different, the have moved from Barcelona to Los Angeles and the have added some scenes and removed some. The ending is actually the only thing that makes REC more worth watching than this. They have removed a quite important scene which to me is really strange. I don't want to walk in closer on the subject since I am afraid I'll spoil to much.So, If you have seen REC you will find your self looking at the same movie with different actors and a few new not so important scenes and I would say it is a waste of time. If you have not seen REC i believe you will enjoy either one of the movies..:Thunen:.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My two cents.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how to feel about this movie. I really liked the source material REC. And a big motivation for me seeing this was Jennifer Carpenter, who I really like on Dexter. That's pretty much where the positive ends for me, though.I understood going into this that it was a remake. I'm not necessarily opposed to remakes so long as the new director puts their own mark on the film, even if it's a small one. That's where Quarantine REALLY fails. I'd have to go back and re-watch REC, but I could swear it's a shot-for-shot remake. I'm pretty sure even the building used for the set is the same building. The director took no steps to add anything new or even remotely different, and that really is a shame. The technical aspects of the movie are all fine. The actors did a good job and, if you were aware beforehand that they'd be using that first-person camera work you probably weren't disappointed there either (though it gets a bit tedious and annoying after awhile).Though my view of this movie is pretty negative, it's hard to say how I'd feel if I'd never seen the Spanish language original. But, as it stands, I did see that one first and this just felt like a complete English language rip off. I'll give it 4/10 simply because it's really solely the director's fault for not being brave enough to step up and leave their mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as good as 'Rec', if not better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly never imagined that I was going to want to defend this movie. After watching both Rec and Rec 2 yesterday and loving them, I had to see how badly the US had ruined yet another good original with "Quarantine". I myself hate the thought of remaking already excellent movies. But it's completely forgivable if you do it right. And Quarantine does it justice.I think the real story behind negative reviews for this movie is the simple nature of it being a remake. No one was trying to take anything from the Spanish people with this remake. They gave credit, and credit was certainly due. All this movie does is take the story to the next level. Just a Spanish audience isn't fair to such a powerful horror movie. And we all know that no one wants to sit and try to read subtitles while we're trying to enjoy a movie, and English dubs just don't cut it.Quarantine takes Rec and gives it an even greater feel, in my opinion. Everyone in the film's acting was much up to par with a great cast. Effects are of course far greater, which some think takes away from the realism. For me it didn't at all. The infected people were a lot more believable. When I'm watching a "movie" I don't think I'm watching footage of actual events just because the quality sucks. The camera and the way it's used is easily comparable to the attributes a TV camera of this day and age. With Rec, if I wasn't trying to enjoy a movie(as I should), I can easily feel as if I'm watching a play.As far as script and plot, of course it was the same for the most part, but this was in no way a shot-for-shot remake as some claim. They changed many scenes and made them a lot more believable. The camera man, for one, gets off his lazy butt a lot more instead of just watching people get mangled. And there are a lot more things, some even very subtle, that feel a lot more logical than in the original. The movie as a whole makes a lot of since, which a lot of horror tends to loose grip of. These were believably scared people doing things that scared people do with no over the top 'trip and fall' routines.The bottom line is I can't deny that Quarantine was scary even after just watching its inspiration and the sequel to that (I don't usually get scared). People need to just stop crying about how they don't want originals to be touched and look at the bright side; They didn't mess it up. If the makers of the original didn't want them to make this movie, they wouldn't have let them.If Quarantine was made first, this argument would switch right around; and Rec would look like a silly imitation. Both Rec and Quarantine are undoubtedly two of the best horror films I have ever seen; and I don't like many. Which was better? If it came down to it, I'd say 'Rec' only because I'm always on the original's side. And also, I like the Spanish lead in Rec more; she's really hot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply the most frustrating film I have had the displeasure of viewing in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is frustrating, probably one of the most frustrating movies I have ever had the will to watch. Despite the usual flaws horror movies seem to have an innate attraction to, this movie takes the cake. Perhaps I am just too high on my own species and I would like to think that given a situation such as the one in Quarantine, common sense would kick in to provide a helping hand. However, when you make characters as boring, mundane, and completely inept of any intelligent decision making or problem solving, I begin to lose interest as my frustration level rises. Between the over obvious situations of danger that even a young child could pick out, the ear wrenching whining of the main character Angela Vidal, and the seemingly incompetent government agencies, it takes all enjoyment and any possibility of me getting lost in the story line away and throws it under a moving truck. One of the biggest down falls of this movie is the lack of realism. Most people, if they saw a zombie and were armed they would kill it, but not in this movie. This movie had the potential to be something unique and interesting but fell short. For this I give it a 3, how this movie ever got any ratings higher is beyond me Aside from all of the above, the movie has some qualities which I can say are good, but not enough to redeem the movie as a whole. The infected were very well done, probably the only reason I kept watching this film. The make up, the acting, and their mannerisms were all executed and delivered in a nice little package. The creepiest zombie being the one at the end. It actually has a great resemblance to the witches in Valves video game creation "Left 4 Dead" and "Left 4 Dead 2".I am not going to get into specifics with this movie as it will just be a waste of time, but I will tell you this, if you are looking for a well done zombie flick with a good story line and interesting characters then don't bother, if you want to see some gnarly zombies then it's worth a quick view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think 28 Days Later but in one single apartment building and you've got Quarantine. Its hard to believe how quick filming a movie from a first person view can get played out. Maybe it came to soon after Cloverfield, which was much a better done first person view film in my opinion. The movie begins just like any other horror movie and plays out as if you had written the script yourself. Like most hack job horror movies the main characters are unbelievably slow in figuring out their situation and by the time they do it's already to late. All in all the entire movie is extremely predictable and the reason for the quarantine has been done far to many times before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enough w/the SHAKY CAM.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this &amp; thought the premise &amp; other parts of the story were interesting. However this film is really mediocre in all respects. I would love for filmmakers to realize that "Shaky Cam" all the time doesn't work, in fact it ruins what could make a decent film. Maybe once in while would be fine, but not throughout your entire film, it looks cheap &amp; makes everyone think you are just trying to hide things such as a lack of a budget. Some of the best films have dinky budgets &amp; they don't have to fall back on "Shaky Cam." Another thing that drove me crazy was that they pretty much wasted Jennifer Carpenter who has shown her range on the excellent Showtime series "Dexter." She seems to be the main character but she doesn't really do anything but run around like an idiot. For the last 15 minutes of the film she is hyperventilating so loudly it's not only distracting, it actually starts to be laughably bad. A little fine, but that much is sad. As far as good points are concerned the film had some good atmospheric elements &amp; when the actors weren't spitting out stupid lines they were all actually pretty good. Unless you are a follower &amp; think "Blair Witch Project" &amp; it's "Shaky Cam" is classic material (which it isn't) don't bother with this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so-so movie, unpleasant to view since over done "handheld" effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are not cinema experts, but we do see a LOT of movies with a happy-go-luck attitude.We can deal with bad plots, bad acting, low budgets, etc. But when these are combined with intentional efforts to make the movie less viewable... it just PO's us and thus I am adding my 2 cents to this blog.I understand the theme of the movie was to view the events through the rolling camera, but they over did it --to the point that you get a headache from the beginning. I've cut home videos with that were a lot more stable. In the movies case, this was supposed to be a professional camera man, yet he still most of the time, zooms in for closeups even though he holds the camera as steady as a novice. I can't believe the editor didn't insist on smoothing it out --just slightly (enough to be enjoyable to viewers, yet still maintaining the hand held fear concept --not to mention the mike often hanging down into the picture!)Bad movie with bad ending, yeah, but the intentional over-done shoddy camera work pushes the flick to the very rare "not worth seeing" level in my books.</fullReview>

My husband and I both felt extremely sick by the time the movie was over...and that was with both of us looking away and covering our eyes most of the time. The movie should have had some sort of warning that it was was filmed using a hand held camera affect. I wasted $19.00 on tickets and $7.50 on candy, which I couldn't eat because I was sick. Perhaps a warning or notice about this camera technique...before people spend over $26.00...would have been helpful, sort of the same way people are warned if shows, or events are going to contain strobe lighting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Possible Spoilers** OK, the bottom line with Quarantine is that it is ultimately entertaining. It is somewhat suspenseful, but I think the over usage of typical horror movie conventions makes the movie more comical than scary. I was pleased to note that when the movie ended, I wasn't the only person in the theater laughing out loud.Look, I love doomsday movies. I love zombie movies and horror movies in general. I loved Cloverfield and The Blair Witch Project. This movie follows in those, uhh, proud traditions but is filled with a ton of camp that I personally do not feel was intentional. The way the mysteries unfold is intriguing and somewhat seat gripping, but every time the scare was delivered, honestly, I burst out laughing.I also had a problem with the fact that the very last scene in the film was shown in the trailer. I had picked this out early in the movie, and it sort of ruined the surprise. Although I was amused by the last sequences and the similarities of the last creature to Gollum from Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. It just cranked up the camp value to 11.The movie is good for cheap entertainment, but keep your expectations low.</fullReview>

No originality, from the half-hearted "make you jump" scenes to the Blair-witch rip off camera style.

		<fullReview>It must be hard times for purveyors of horror films. After all, given the uncertainty surrounding the economy right now, it would seem that real life is more frightening than anything in a horror movie.However perhaps there is redemption if the movie maker if capable of pioneering a new vision in horror. On that note, I must say that "Quarantine" isn't the new vision of horror, but rather a familiar medium that has made many, many recent appearances in the annals (and I use that term literally) of movie making! For those not up to deciphering the exact plot, just look up the definition of the title of the movie, and you'll have a real good idea. A journalist who is shadowing a pair of firemen accompanies them on a call to a building where the residents have heard strange noises coming from the apartment of an elderly resident.Within moments of their arrival, a police man on scene has his throat bitten, a fireman is bitten and falls off the stairway, and all hell breaks loose when they can't evacuate the victims of this elderly maniac because the CDC and the national guard have arrived on the scene to quarantine the building. On a side note, isn't it a tad ironic that at a time when the American nightmare is losing your home, people are being forced to remain inside? Elements of claustrophobia are explored, along with sexism early on in the film, but ultimately what the film is about is an apparent strain of rabies with an onset so rapid that the infected are like zombies who are on the prowl to kill the uninfected.Somehow, even though they are not residents of the building and are thus new to the environment, the two survivors at the end are the journalist and the camera man. Among the peculiar discoveries they make is an apartment that has been converted into a make shift lab, complete with animal testing, beakers and flasks of peculiar chemicals, and newspaper clippings about doomsday cults Yeah, way to throw in some curve ball there guys! On a You Tube review, another viewer suggested that its never a good sign for a movie to show the concluding scene in the commercials advertising it, and you know, he's right. In fact, although Jennifer Carpenter is more than serviceable as a modern day scream queen, this generation of horror film maker seems to have been raised on the slasher and zombie horror of the 80's. The only problem is, it isn't the 80's. Its not even the 90's! If you go to see this film, what you can expect is LOTS of shaky camera shots that do not really allow you to focus on any one thing, a lot of running, a lot of screaming, and a fair bit of gore. Again though, for you gore fiends, the shaky camera does limit your ability to fully appreciate just how gory it would appear that some of the scenes are! In short, this film has been made to capitalize on the success of films like "The Blair Witch Project" and "Cloverfield," however its neither as witty or as campy as those films are, and the storyline wears very, very thin very fast.</fullReview>

Through out the film and despite all that is happening around them, neither has the sense God gave a horse to stop what they are doing and concentrate on the mounting problems they are systematically forced into. Their story begins as a routine visit to a fire station to film a 'normal' day at the fire house. Yet once they are in, they fall prey to an on-going CDC situation where a virus of some sort has been released inside an apartment complex. It seem some animals have contracted a bug which spreads from victim to victim incredibly fast. So much so that the outside world wants to seal them inside their enclosure permanently. Although the film warrants attention, it's nevertheless a visual disappointment and it's consignment should be relegated to the back row of obscurity. *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So far this years best horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine starring Jennifer Carpenter is easily this years best horror movie. Based on the very successful Spanish horror (Rec) which was released only a year ago Quarantine has been loyal to the original but also adding some own twists to spice things up. The story is very simple and straight to the point. Angela Vidal (Carpenter) is shooting a reality show about firefighters and follows two guys when they get a call about a woman acting strange in a remote building. Once Angela and her cameraman (played by a convincing Steve Harris) things start to get bloody. As the outside world finds out that the people inside the building have developed rabies, the authorities shut the building down and anyone trying to get out will be executed. Because this movie is shoot through the eyes of the cameraman it sometimes gets annoying and a bit hard to see what is actually going on. However that doesn't stop the action and horror to be top notch. One really good thing about this movie is that the supporting cast is mainly played by people from different TV shows and there is no real star in the movie which is really good because you don't no who is going to die next. There are easily 4,5 scenes that will make you jump out of your seat and the last 5 minutes are absolutely frightening. The isolation Angela feels is really horrible and Jennifer Carpenter does an amazing and moving performance.This year has been a really bad year for horrors but with Quarantine 2008 has finally had a successful and really scary movie and hopefully 2009 will provide more movies like this.The movie is well worth the 10 euro I paid. Highly recommended!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the first "first person" shot film that is shot believably! I saw Quarantine this afternoon and thought is was simply... awesome! See it on the big screen. It's worth the $$$ for the fun.Angela (Jennifer Carpenter) and Scott (Steve Harris) are a second string news crew assigned to cover a "typical" night shift of their local fire department. The excitement of a late night call to assist two police officers with a disturbance in an old apartment building turns ugly when an old woman tenant takes a hefty bite out of an officer's neck. What begins as an uneventful evening slowly erupts into an explosive fearfest that kicks away all the stops as it pushes relentlessly towards an undeniably foreseen but still-claustrophobic-and-freaky conclusion.Carpenter's portrayal of the amateurish-but-ambitious-journalist turned scared-out-of-her-skull caged victim is nothing short of spectacular. In the end, it is her performance that stays with you even after the credits begin to roll.Typically, I grow pretty tired of the "first person" shot films, but in Quarantine, Harris' Scott utilizes his news camera believably, not only as that of a news cameraman but also as the tool to escape. At no time did I find myself saying out loud "Yeah, right! Like he is going to still be filming..." There is enough unseen footage and plot questions left at the end to cash in on some serious DVD extras which this film will no doubt contain when it is released on disk.If you have seen the Spanish "REC" as I have and think that Quarantine will be just another American remake like so many of the J-Horror flicks like I did, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how many times you'll jump and fidget watching Quarantine nonetheless. I know I was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enhanced Version of the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angela Vidal" (Jennifer Carpenter) is a young television reporter who is collecting material for a night-time show in Los Angeles. In this particular episode she and her cameraman, "Scott Percival" (Steve Harris) are sent to a fire station to film an ordinary night with the fire department. When a call is received they decide to follow two firemen who are assigned to the case. Upon arriving at an apartment complex they notice that two policemen have also just made it to the scene and so they follow them inside. Once inside they all go upstairs to find an old woman covered in blood and screaming. She then bites one of the policemen in the throat and after pulling her off they evacuate downstairs taking the injured policeman with them. Not long afterward one of the firemen is also attacked and thrown down the staircase suffering serious injuries as well. At this point the decision is made to evacuate the apartment complex but they find that they have been locked inside and are trapped with the residents. Now, while it is tempting to say that this film is a "carbon copy" of the movie "Rec", the fact is it would be more appropriate to call this movie an "enhanced version" of the original. Also, while I personally didn't see a need for a remake, this particular picture has certain attributes that are worth mentioning. First, "Quarantine" is a more polished version than "Rec". The film is of a higher quality and the camera work is less shaky. And while "Rec" had a more realistic feeling, the attention to detail in "Quarantine" made it more viewable in my opinion. Additionally, "Rec" was filmed in Spanish and dubbed in English which is, in all honesty, never quite as good as having everything in a language a person understands. So, on those scores I suppose "Quarantine" rates slightly higher. On the other hand, those viewers who have already seen "Rec" probably won't get the same thrill out of "Quarantine" because they already know what transpires before it even happens. Be that as it may, both films are quite good and I believe that most zombie enthusiasts will probably enjoy either one. I know I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie! I have watched this at least 10 times since it came out at the theaters over four years ago. It is a gripping the edge of your seat, cover your eyes movie. One of the original outbreaks in filming from a first person point of view, this fantastic movie was done in every right way possible. The whole time will have you thinking "what would I do? how would I get out? I'm so glad that's not me!". It starts off with a reporter interviewing a local fire department. After following them to a apartment building after receiving a 9-1-1 call, they get locked inside with a deadly virus, trying to survive at all costs. It's incredible how such a simple plot that doesn't extend beyond this, can captivate you and have you holding your breath the entire time. This is definitely a MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm just really into zombie flicks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some will disagree about this being a zombie flick, but the people who are bitten get sick and can only be killed by severing the spine. I guess the only reason I couldn't rate higher is because of the leading lady's stupidity and constant screaming. She would not have made it 10 minutes in most zombie flicks, someone should have killed her off early as her screaming only draws attention. Her high pitched shrieking really turned me off, I had to turn the volume down as to not wake my family but then couldn't hear the conversations. On a good note, I did jump a few times and the plot was great (although I cannot really attribute this to this particular movie, as it is a remake of Rec). The best part was the very end, I really appreciated it! 7/10 because zombie films rock and found-footage rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated American remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this movie is rated poorly by people who are biased in believing that any movie remade into an American adaptation is just terrible. Sometimes that may be true, but you can't just disregard it completely and jump to conclusions. I own both Quarantine and Rec, and Quarantine slightly edges rec. better character development for starters. The firemen in this one are so much more likable and you almost genuinely don't want to see them die. The firemen in Rec are boring and you just don't have the slightest clue who they are. Rec has its extreme moments, but OVERALL this remake is more suspenseful. The scene that comes right after the power goes out is extremely frightening and well done. I don't know, bad reviews rubbed me the wrong way. There are a lot of things I love about this AND Rec, both movies are very respectable and entertaining. Don't go watching this one thinking "oh jeeze, an American remake, this will surely be terrible." It's a very solid movie.</fullReview>

Camera work from behind the lens thru the entire movie very irritating and stupid. (borderline headache for people prone to motion sickness) Hysterical screaming thru the last third of the movie hard on the ears, and just wants to make you slap the stupid woman unconscious. No ending at all to resolve the movie, or give you any clue on how the problem really started. A total waste of time!!! Too bad ratings can't have negative numbers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaky-cam thriller worth seeing, even if it's not the most original premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a somewhat bored viewer of zombie movies, I have to say, this was entertaining. It took a Blair Witch Project/Cloverfield approach to unknowingly covering a story of an infestation in an L.A.-area apartment complex. The main actress, Jennifer Carpernter, is actually quite good, showing a more playful, regular mood in the beginning, and she is in downright hysterics by the end. There was no music (since this is just a filmed account of what happened, like a news broadcast would be), but the sound quality was very good for all the creaking and breaking going on. The premise has been done before, and the replay value of the movie is so-so, in my opinion. (I mean, once you know what happens, you don't really go watch these kind of movies over and over again.) The ending was out of House of 1,000 Corpses, in my opinion, but without the gang of misfits and everything. Let's just say someone doesn't like L.A. very much. Overall, though, I gave it a 6-star rating because I thought it was very well made, and I think the audience will watch it through to the end even though there are other movies very close to it regarding the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent horror film, better than the original "Rec"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a remake of the movie "Rec", which I have seen and thought was a mediocre movie.This is a fairly good horror movie, with infected rabid humans standing in for crazed zombies. It has a nice dark and creepy atmosphere and some good scares in it. The last scene on the top level of the apartment building is the best part and the most intense, where the last two survivors play hide and seek in pitch blackness from a monstrous being. I have to admit I jumped and found this scene scary. The rest of the movie leading up to this is the standard fare of people running away and barricading themselves in rooms from zombies, nothing that original or compelling, but on the whole with good production values, decent acting, and above average camera work.One thing I found annoying was the lead actress kind of overplayed the hysteria angle, and it got tedious listening to her constant moans and sobbing at the end of the film. We get it, she was hysterical with fear, enough already.I was thankful they disdained the played out fad of shaky camera syndrome and jump cuts that are so popular these days. This remake was much better than the original movie "Rec".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best executed first person shooter I have seen yet--but I haven't seen the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to hold off watching this until I saw the original Spanish version, REC, but it was on television the other day and for lack of reading material and an Internet connection I decided to sit it out. It's really a shame that I saw it on television, too, because the commercial breaks really cut into the fantastic execution of a slowly building horror movie. This movie deserves some kudos for being able to consistently build rising tension from the carefree and playful beginning to the tiny tension-filled space of its conclusion. It may not be the most original story, but it is thus far the best executed first person shooter currently out there.I like the first person shooter horror genre. Ever since Blair Witch Project came out, I've been game, even though it is very much so a genre with massive hits and massive misses. For what it's worth so far, Diary of the Dead gets my vote for most meaningful and intelligent, but it really falls apart in execution, best shown by the introductory, "I have decided to put music over it to make it more engaging." Uh, what? Quarantine avoids music entirely (awesome) and, best of all, is essentially 28 Days Later in a very confined space.A VERY confined space.This, to me, equates quality survival horror. Not only are the characters trying to escape rabid reanimated corpses, but they are also stuck with each other, forcing the human element out as panic takes over and characters get into fist-fights over simple arguments. The heart is aflutter with glee just thinking about it. Here, it's even more fun because while you want the characters to survive, you also have the outsider perspective of the quarantine itself, meaning you also want the characters to be contained. Outbreak, claustrophobia, mob rule, the state of emergency, and fast zombies all in what looks and feels like less than a thousand foot square space, accelerated at a brilliantly constant pace.Which means I am even more incentives to see the Spanish original, though with understanding that there's going to be some differences in approach, and thus realizing that this might, just might, be a case where the remake ousts the original. I say this because one of the absolute best parts of Quarantine is the cameraman as character who at one point even uses the camera as a weapon to smash a zombie head to pulp. Think the hilariousness and pure visceral pleasure of the Yellow Man's untimely end in Sin City from the perspective of Bruce Willis' fist. YES. It is that awesome. If the original doesn't have that, then better or worse Quarantine still gets my vote for the "Why hadn't anybody thought of that yet?" moment right there. According to my compatriot hanging out nearby, he hadn't heard me laugh so gleefully since Brad Pitt got it to the face in Burn after Reading.This movie deserves a little more appreciation than just that, however. I have already mentioned the tension building but I have neglected to mention the shot composition. One of the main reasons why I find Diary of the Dead to be a success over the likes of Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield is that George Romero is smart enough to let the so-called student filmmakers actually know how to hold the camera steady long enough to actually show something. In Quarantine, the cameraman character is a professional and for the majority of the movie keeps things pretty composed, even if it's unrealistic to imagine he'd be capable of doing it while running away in a panic from vicious violent monsters. Take it from a professional video technician himself, it's really hard to run along and remember to zoom in and out while you're doing it, much less the snapping zooms featured here (you can, even accidentally, use the servo zoom for most prosumer cameras, but to get snap zooms like the one's featured here usually requires constant operation of the manual zoom with a second hand). However, at least throughout most of the movie you can actually see what's going on, and the frames get more broken and jittery in perfect correlation to the tension. By the end, the light on the end of the camera is flickering on and off, the cameraman is shaking, the zoom is wild, and the effect is like what annoys most people about this genre, watching a strobe-light instead of a film, but again I do not believe this movie overuses it in hiding other elements of the movie like production design and, best of all, the mad scientist reveal at the end.Anyway, I'm pleasantly surprised how enjoyable this movie was and now I'm quite anxious to see the original. It is a shame that this movie contains the stigma of a remake but if the original is going to wow me, it will probably be because the thin plot of the remake has a stronger development or drive in the original to achieve the same ends. I suppose I will see, in the meantime, I can't help but recommend this one as a success taken on its own.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

This is, for all intents and purposes, "The Blair Witch Project" and "Cloverfield" meets "Rabid", "Night of the Living Dead", "They Came From Within", "Nightmare At Noon", "Cabin Fever", "28 Days","The Crazies", and all the Dead remakes and sequels that feature a zombie like disease or plague that causes near instant contagion. This one did have a few good scenes, but after so many similar movies, I found myself bored despite all the frenetic action and camera movement. (Thankfully I never seem to get motion sickness from traveling or movies). If you are one who does, STAY AWAY from this one for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Quarantine" is a horror film that follows the concept of one single camera capturing the details of a strange and frightening happening. These reminds me of "Cloverfield" that leads back to "The Blair Witch" first film and that grabbed the idea from the shocking "Cannibal Holocaust". "Quarantine" is the remake of the French film named "Rec." (which unfortunately I haven't seen it) and that leads to many comparison among viewers. I'll won't do this here because of that but I will compare it with some of the other movies I mentioned and it's place in horror films, what it represents. One reporter (Jennifer Carpenter) and her cameraman (Steve Harris) are making a special report with some L.A. firefighters when suddenly they're called for an emergency call. When they get to the place of the emergency (a building) they realize that something strange is happening after a old lady attacks a cop by biting him and after that zombie creatures appears sucking blood from the residents of the building. At last they're quarantined without knowing exactly what's going on. From beginning until end the movie is showed by the point of view of the cameraman. So be prepared for a hand held and shaky (and not annoying at all) camera trembling, filming with almost no kind of illumination (specially in the last minutes). And with that an interesting mystery about what happens to the people on the building, the quarantine scheme and the aftermath with the creatures running around and killing everyone. For me everything was impressive in terms of horror, tension and mystery. In terms of bothering the viewer writers selected an annoying reporter who keeps screaming, crying, and hyperventilating all the time. In some moments I wanted to jump on the scream and slap her on the face. She's THAT annoying. I know that it was a tense situations and most of the characters are angry, not calm and all but she over reacts in some moments. That might disturb some viewers and not in a good way.But there's some flaws and incoherences in it too. I mean the whole quarantine thing seemed out of place here. First there's a call, firefighters go see what it is, police already was there, the old lady attacks and all of sudden...quarantine! In the middle of this situation (when some CDC guys enter in the building) it is said that the people from CDC (Center for Disease Control) knew something was happening in the building after tracking a sick dog who lived in there with a family. So how could they possibly know that the disease already had spread? They simply just put the building in quarantine and allowed one of their representantives to go in there. That guy never returned. They send more? No. Why? Who knows? But they ordered the Army to shoot people who were trying to get out of the building. Other thing that really bothered me was the disabled old man mentioned in one conversation but he never appeared in the film (a plot hole). When everything started and the police started to count the people in the building someone says that the African couple has a old man in their apartment, a paralytic man and the policeman wants him to be brought where everybody is. But people keep saying no, he might have spread the disease. Just because is he on a wheelchair. What is it? Are we in 1919 when just saying poliomyelitis was scary enough to people stay away? That was totally pointless and prejudiced.Despite these minor flaws I thought it was a great film, very well made and very entertaining. The cast worked good (specially Jay Hernandez as one of the firefighters) but for some audiences it might be a distractive thing because of some known names (but I'm not counting Johnathon Schaech because he's unrecognizable here). And that was the "Cloverfield" vantage. Why's that? It makes more scarier (remember the realistic effect that "Cannibal Holocaust" caused in the 1980's when people thought the actors were really killed?).I'm really looking forward to watch "Rec." and see if people are right quoting that "Quarantine" was weaker than the French film. Until there I'm still gonna think this movie deserves a view, it's quite good. Nothing similar as the other movies I mentioned though. Hollywood here's my message: That's the way you MUST use the shaky camera without bother the viewer! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>now i would originally give this movie a 10 out of 10 but since i never seen the original and this is a remake i wont make any comparison and most people are saying the original is better so ill have to watch it first. even so this movie was incredibly made, the acting was very well, it captures how real citizens would act i mean if something random like this happened there would be mass hysteria and nobody would listen like this movie shows. Everyone is believable in this movie and Hilary Swank probably is the best person when acting as someone scared or paranoid, by the end of the movie she cant even take a step without freaking out. now the camera in this movie dose move a lot, but its done great unlike the Blair witch project and it shown killing with a camera in a way no other movie has before. if you really think about it and rabies effected every human like this and the building were to be quarantined this is extremely creepy. just watch the movie and pay no attention to the haters who say we are idiots for giving this movie a high rating or those who give it a low, its very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality Horror done Right..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me just tell you that I am NOT a fan of reality horror. I thought Blair Witch sucked and was the least bit frightening. Cloverfield bored me to no end and Paranormal Activity was slow but my favorite of the genre. It took me a long time to actually see Quarantine because I really had No desire to do so. I had read some reviews and watched the trailers and thought: "Oh great.. Another try at scaring the reality TV kids.." Well, I was wrong. Quarantine started off quite slow and I was certain that it would become the bore-fest that I expected, again, I was wrong.. Director John Dowdle had done his homework, and most likely realized why the foe-mentioned reality horror films didn't quite work on a massive level, and corrected the problems. Quarantine has some down right creepy moments, and keeps the viewer on edge through out most of the film. You can certainly feel the dread of the characters and place yourself into the situation, which is why it worked for me. Once the horror starts, it seldom lets up, and that is what makes Quarantine a much better film then it's predecessors. Highly dramatic segments that make you feel like your in a spook-house, just waiting for something to jump out at you...and they do! Solid performances and writing, my only gripe would have to be with the constant shaky-cam which always pisses me off, but I can at least understand why it's there, because the characters are running for their lives through out 90% of the film.. Well done and certainly worth a gander by any true horror fan.</fullReview>

It gets you so close to the people and it makes you feel like you are trapped inside the building with all the characters. I so felt that I wanted to go out of that building when they shut the doors and quarantined the whole area. The movie had a very clever atmosphere that the darkness made you feel as if you are the camera man and it really sensed like you are inside with everybody else.I think that the movie was a horror of the finest kind and I don't mind the remakes of foreign movies because I wouldn't enjoy horror in languages other than English. I understand French and didn't enjoy French horrors and didn't as well with originals of Asian movies.

		<fullReview>Quarantine definitely isn't a great film. I saw it a while ago and let me just say... you may need some hearing aids after you see it. It's loud, and, actually dizzy. Quarantine could be a lot worse, but it's not actually good. I tried to fall asleep during this movie, but how the hell could I? The film is incredibly loud and hard to pay attention to. Let me just say, the film gave me a headache.Jennifer Carpenter from Emily Rose stars as a reporter who is giving an interview with firefighters. She decides to tag along with them when they hear about something going on in an apartment complex. Clearly, the bitch made a mistake. Because she soon becomes trapped in the building, and something weird is going on. There are a ton of disturbing moments during Quarantine. It will scare people. But I am not recommending it.I think that the film is probably too much for people. I sort of lost interest after a while because the film just kept going on and on and on. I knew what was going to happen in the end thanks to the trailer. I'll admit that the end will freak you out, but I don't think that you should see it. It's at least worth a rental. It's not a movie that I cared for, but maybe somebody else will find it amusing.Quarantine:**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>same idea as Cloverfied except better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea for this movie has been done before, and it's filmed in a style that I like. One of the characters, Scott, follows everyone around with a camera and light, and we see what happens through that camera. So you get realistic unsteady shots of people running and you can't see much in a dark room. It makes the whole film more creepy.Angela is a reporter that is going to follow a couple of firefighters around all night with her camera man, Scott. They get a call to an apartment building. The cops are already there and they go up to a room with a crazy old lady. Before they know it, the lady bites one of the cops. Then full panic mode erupts. Before anyone can get out, the CDC barricades them inside. A resident, whom is a vet, suspects rabies from the symptoms that are present from the bitten people. Soon the bitten are attacking the living and it's everyone for themselves.The last part when Angela, Scott, and Jake are trying to get the keys and escape was creepy. And at the end when Angela and Scott are in that room with that creature, that was scary.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was a pretty good horror movie. It's styled like the ultra hyped Cloverfield, except I thought this was much more tense and creepy. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the Amercian remake of the Spanish film Wreck, which was in turn based on the Australian Film 7 Wives for 7 Sons. It tells the story of a journalist and cameraman who decide to to a story on Firemen working late shifts. They visit Bluewatch and speak to various firemen and firewomenmen such as Sicknote, Pittbull, Georgiadis, Poison Pearce, Recall, and Bayleaf. In the middle of supper the fire bell goes off and they all rush into their Fire Engines. The Journalist (Sue) and the cameraman (Emilio) follow. In the truck they ask what is happening and the firemen say it's probably just a routine check or false alarm, but sounds like someone has locked themselves into a room in a hotel. An emergency clearly, but hardly exciting. They reach the hotel, enter, and the horror begins.This is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. I know people think it is a horror, but I didn't find it scary et al. I like my horrors to have monsters and ghosts and vampires and men with balaclavas, but this just had a pile of crazy people running about going 'oggily boogily' at each other. I particularly enjoyed the moment when one crazy person is sliding down the banister but slips and falls 13 storeys to the floor, and lands on his nose. Everyone screamed in the cinema but I made a front error in my pants due to laughtering. Another person handcuffed herself to a railing and then complained when the crazies were going to eat her face. I laughed at her screams and the way the daughter kept shouting 'Why are they eating my mummy?' I laughed even more when I realised that didn't actually happen. I liked the way the people were 'trapped' in the building by unseen government forces outside. 'Let us out!' they screamed. 'We can't' came the reply. 'Why not!?' they asked. 'Because'. This was an interesting satire on how faceless politicians control our every move, they can watch us and tell us what to do- we vote them into power but when we are getting our legs eaten they just laugh. I laughed too.I wasn't sure what to make of the hand-held camera. I kept expecting Beadle to appear from the oven dressed as a policeman and reveal that it was all an elaborate stunt, but this never transpired. Indeed the situation gets worse as more people are eaten until only a handful (sorry for the pun! : ) xoxo LOL!) of inmates remain. The place is overrun with crazy types, running about in cardigans and saying that they listen to REM. In such a dire situation I would have strapped on my AK and unleashed a holy rain of thunder on them. None of them have any weapons except a fire axe and a fire frying pan, but these prove useless; much like the time I tried to kill a spider with a a broken elastic band. Soon they are chased to the top floor of the building where the final horror is released. I won't spoil it for you, but it turns out to be some spindly freak who has been experimented on and caused an outbreak of skeebies. The final shot is quiet funny as all the lights switch off, Sue slips on the slippery floor, and slides out of the camera's view down the stairs going 'weeee!' Best Scene: When the guy who looks like Vincent Price hides in his room and doesn't let anyone else in as the crazies are chasing them. That's exactly what I would have done. In these situations it's every camp man for himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not the worst movie ever, but not so good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seems to be getting a bad rep on IMDb, but honestly, I wasn't very into the movie the first time I saw it. The beginning was slow and extremely boring, however once it started going, I couldn't get enough! The characters are believable, and even though I can't stand Jennifer Carpenter, I actually liked seeing her have the worst night of her life. The camera work, although hand-held was very claustrophobic (in a good, scary way) and the dialog was well written. Overall, I rate this film 7/10 because like I said, it wasn't a great movie, but it was defiantly not the worst film ever. I would recommend renting it or just watching it on the movie channels, because it is defiantly a ride not to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gimmicky but effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ditzy female TV reporter in Los Angeles and her cameraman pay a visit to a firehouse and end up on a call to an apartment building where a that very quickly turns her into a ravenous, screaming, flesh-eating zombie, one right out of a Dario Argento or George Romero movie. The city and CDC seal the building, as more and more of the building's inhabitants rapidly transform into zombies. It then becomes a chaotic search among the few survivors to find a way out of the building. Unfortunately, there is a gimmick, which only works part of the time: the entire movie is seen through the TV cameraman's lens. No musical soundtrack, which ads to the documentary feel. Decent gore, although this is not a true greyhound movie as the gore is done in relatively quick cuts. Good zombie makeup. The ultimate answer to the mutated rabies virus that has doomed the building lies in an attic apartment, and it makes for a pretty bad discovery. Be forewarned: This is not a movie for anyone expecting a happy ending or a single moment of relief. It's intense and extremely clever in its presentation, but very depressing. And at times, it an be downright harrowing. Keep the little ones out of the room while watching this. It probably should have gone out unrated, as it transcends an "R" rating..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked The Blair Witch Project, and 28 Days Later.. then most likely you'll like this movie. It has the shaky, home made movie, camera moves of the Blair Witch, along with the boring plot ( minus the snotty nose and weird ending), and the people trapped in one building with zombies of most typical Zombie movies. The first 20 minuets of the film aren't bad.. the whole documentary of the fire station gets old, but when they first respond to the apartment and things get going.. it's like "Finally!" However.. it doesn't last long.. pretty soon you know exactly where it's going and the rest of the time you are watching it just so you got your money's worth. I found that the only tension in this movie was because you knew the zombie people were going to jump out and attack, you just didn't know when and you wanted them to just do it already! I caught myself not even focusing on the movie anymore, but rather thinking that it was like going to a haunted house- you expect there to be people jumping out and trying to get at you, but yet you know they can't do anything. I found myself wondering what it was like on the set with these women screaming and people crawling around on the floor... it was a total waste of my money... maybe I should have rented Prom Night instead!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun for the first half, torture for the second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a big disappointment to me. I mean, I usually have the habit of going into any movie with low expectations, but Quarantine at least looked like my type of thing, and I found myself enjoying it a fair bit after things got going. But then, midway through, it just got extremely irritating. It was like every single person was determined to make a totally obvious and fatal mistake at some point in the movie. Some of them made smart moves or fought back well the first attack or two, but then it only made me groan at their stupidity all the more when they failed the next time. Characters would continue to get way too close or turn their backs to the infected, even after they'd seen an infected person kill several people. But the thing that completely killed it for me was the female lead, the reporter. You could tell from the beginning that she was "excitable", shrieking and jumping around over winning a bet or a game. And when people started dying, she flipped. She became like a child, needing to be comforted every five minutes so that she'd keep moving, screaming about being left in the dark, and flailing at her fellow survivors for no good reason. When she wasn't wailing like a banshee, she was loudly hyperventilating and sobbing. My dearest wish throughout the last part of the movie was that the cameraman would stop coddling her and instead deck her so she'd shut up. So, basically, it was a maddening experience and a great disappointment. And to top it off (spoiler about the end ahead, though it'll probably be obvious to most anyway), the very end of the movie was what was shown in advertisements. You didn't even get to have that last little part; you could tell what was going to happen when the night vision came on, and you were just waiting for it to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was going to see this movie few weeks ago but thanks to IMDb I check here first and learned that it's a remake and I have to watch the original first! So that's what I did and saw (Rec) first and tonight watched this remake. I think the original works way better. It's kind of fascinating to find out why. It's basically the same script and both use hand held camera. So you might ask why on earth this remake doesn't work as well! It's all about the little things and how and when to show the events. This is a perfect example of how a talented filmmaker can affect a movie. I find the original creepier. Just compare the endings. Isn't it creepier in the original? And it's just all about the camera work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First person zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a better movie than most, but not by much. I am curious about the Spanish REC movie from 2007 that this one was a remake of. The beginning was great, showing the characters and making the audience "feel" them. It could have played some major emotional chords from there. Unfortunately, it all turned into the Blair Zombie Cloverfield project really soon. I especially disliked that the characters did not seem to have seen any zombie movie and were unable to recognize them when they saw them.I don't know how this film could have had such a cast, though. Forget lovely Jennifer Carpenter (the lead, Dexter's sister), but also Johnathon Schaech (which I couldn't even recognize with the giant mustache), Rade Serbedzija, Greg Germann and Dania Ramirez played in it.So, bottom line: modern zombies (scientifically explained, fast and ravenous) in a building that is quarantined by the CDC from the outside. Trapped camera crew documents everything until the very end. I am gonna watch REC just to see what they missed in this one :D</fullReview>

A news reporter and her camera man are shooting a story about a firefighting crew. One night the crew receives an emergency call to a apartment complex. What they inside will lead to a night of horror as they find out that the building has been pit under a mandatory quarantine, leaving the people inside to deal with whatever the government authorities do not want to leave the building. Inside the news reporter, her cameraman , the firefighters and the residents have to wait until the quarantine is lifted. Can they survive the horror that awaits them? Will they be able to document the events inside? Who will be left to tell the tale? Find out when you watch Quarantine!This movie is really good. I was surprised because I usually don't enjoy remakes, especially ones that come out on DVD before the original. But I this one is recommended for those people who enjoy survival horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of this you've seen before. A reporter with a camera man filming an event as it happens in our society. You've seen it in Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project and Diary of the Dead. In this case a strain of rabies has infected people in an apartment building while a film crew tags along with the fire department on the first call for help.The film is too long. If they had shortened some of it I would have enjoyed it much better. Some of the scenes are anxiety provoking and very well done but a lot of it is tired and we've seen it all before.I do like the ending and think it was probably the best part of the film. We never see too much or get a clear explanation which keeps it mysterious and interesting. In fact, the last 20 minutes are the best part of the picture.Not bad at all but too long and really not much new here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hollow horror victory, but a victory nonetheless. I guess?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who moan about the 'current' Hollywood thirst for remakes tend to forget that there's nothing 'current' about it: Hollywood's been remaking movies for decades. Especially horrors. Be that as it may, the enormity of this age-old vogue is well on the brink of futility. I mean, do films like Halloween, The Omen, Amityville, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Psycho and Friday the 13th really need to be remade? Course not. Do "foreign" films like The Grudge, The Eye, The Ring, Pulse, Premonition, Dark Water and One Missed Call? Course not. Yet it comes as no surprise that the scariest ever by product of Spanish cinema,(rec), was seized and canned by Hollywood before it even hit the screens back last April.With the exception of a new title, cast, language and location, not much else has changed. Instead of Madrid, 2008, it's Los Angeles, 2008, and a small team of TV reporters are following a squad of firemen on a routine night shift. The footage is completely live and the first job of the night is to rescue a helpless old lady who is trapped inside her apartment: a standard call, a simple call. Or is it? This, after all, is a brutal concoction of terror and realism- a horror film. Hence, it all goes Pete Tong: the old dear loses the plot and a zombie virus takes over the building.Now, the only thing that matters is getting the hell out of this high-rise hell house but wait, it's been cordoned off by the LAPD: quarantined. What are the odds!? The only thing left for the uninfected to do is scrounge the place for an exit; to run, hide and try to survive. To make a break for the roof, to kill as many zombies as they can and keep that camera rolling.Quarantine, then, is a near replica of Jaume Balanguero and Paco Plaza's much better hand-held opus (rec). A film so simple yet shrewd, so edgy and erratic that the viewer is never unaware of the inevitable sledgehammer blows that shake and shock throughout the fleeting yet ruthless plot. Here, director John Erick Dowdle has done an OK job. His Quarantine echoes all but everything that made (rec) tick including its unforgettable last act (a horrific stairway chase followed by a near unwatchable, night vision take of a deserted penthouse containing nothing but the answers behind the film's mystery and a gangly, malnourished zombie who comes out of the dark and scares you silly. Films like The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, (rec) and, now, Quarantine are what I liked to call 'cinematic marmite'- they evoke extreme reactions. Some love, some hate. The reasons to love are reasons to hate- raw, course and tangible film-making that blends truth with trickery, encouraging the viewer to empathise and participate whether they want to or not. Yes, the shaky 'discovered footage' gambit has become a bit of a gimmick but when it works- it works. Quarantine will enthral just as many as it'll appal.Final Verdict: Given the fact that (rec) relied little on the conviction and frequency of on screen dialogue, a virtual frame-for-frame, act-for-act remake was unnecessary in cinematic terms and nothing a little dubbing (or jazzy Slumdog styled subtitles) couldn't have handled. Like (rec) and Cloverfield, Quarantine shuns the Blair Witch's slow boiling paranoia approach and goes straight for the jugular. The outcome is quite horrific yet a clear photocopy but it's done so with such clout and pace, you won't care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't bother with this one. The idea is old, several scenes rely on people's stupidity to work, and you don't care about any of the characters. This is another film shot in the style of Cloverfield/Blair Witch where the camera is controlled by one of the characters. They actually did a decent job of that. But the cameraman seems to feel it is more important to get a good shot of someone being horrifically killed rather than put the camera down and lend the victim a hand. Jennifer Carpenter ("Dexter") does a respectable job and it was nice to see Greg Germann ("Ally McBeal") again. But really the only reason I can see that this movie was redone (the original was titled REC, see http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1038988/) was so that someone else could cash in on the idea, which isn't even original. The idea is "28 Days Later", the camera work is "Blair Witch" and they even throw in a bit of night vision camera work a la "Silence of the Lambs". I kind of feel like my intelligence has been insulted.</fullReview>

The hand-held news camera type presentation was rather too good at getting the best shots, almost like it was being directed, and even so it was still annoying.The question that zombie movies raise is, how can people in the modern world spend so long not recognizing a mad zombie when they see one. The viewer has to really believe that so many supposedly intelligent educated people can be so stupid and slow on the uptake. It's like they forgot that the only good zombie is a beheaded one.On the other hand, I may be over-analyzing all this just a tad.Not really scary but a good ending redeemed it somewhat - it was just what I hoped would happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>REC was an insane movie, a nonstop, free roaming white knuckle thrill ride that doesn't let up for its entire running time. Quarantine, while not in the same league, manages to retain that feel and that pacing that worked so well in the original. For anybody that doesn't know REC was a small independent Spanish film that opened in very few cinemas here in the UK. For those that did get a chance to see it in the cinema it was a swift, terrifying roller-coaster with one of the stomach curling, horrifying ending of all time. I couldn't give the movie enough praise, it managed to take an old formula and reinvent itself.Quarantine is the American remake, shot for shot and unchanged in so many ways it's nearly identical to its Spanish originator. What allowed me to like this movie so much more than I wanted to, was because while most American remakes cannot do justice to their sources. Quarantine caters for that audience that missed out on it first time round.It's because this movie is shot for shot that fans of the original will not be offended with what this movie does but it also makes it obvious that this is not a movie catered for that audience.Hopefully this will have the effect where those that enjoy what this movie brings to the table and walks out of the cinema having not seen REC shaken and stirred. Hopefully they will be enticed to seek RECout on DVD. Quarantine as a movie, isn't perfect. One of the reasons the Spanish is a better film is that this film, it feels put on. It feels as if these actors are merely going through the motions whilst with the original you were more engrossed. It really allowed you to feel for these characters and it was upsetting when their time came.Also this version of the film it undoubtedly less authentic, unlike REC which when to the extremes of casting a real TV Presented to play set role, here everything is set up and while it manages to retain its frights to a outstanding degree it never surpasses the realism the first one conveyed. To the films advantage, it's a bloodthirsty movie, blood and guts seep from every crevice the environments are claustrophobic and so very dank, despite all of the flaws Quarantine was destined to face upon release. It's certainly not a bad film. It retains its dark, creepy atmosphere and while not to the same effect as REC it manages to scare even those who have already seen the original. Jenifer Carpenter does a admirable job a bringing out the raw humanity of her character but once again not to the same effect Manuela Velasco did this time last year.Verdict: It's an admirable effect, a one that will ultimately go unrecognized. If you've already seen REC you don't need to see this movie. If you haven't it should go to the top of your list of movies to see in the cinema because that is the best place to watch it. A frenzied full blooded adrenalin ride pumped with steroids, far from perfect, but terrifying none the less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quaratine all remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine is a remake of a 2007 Spanish film called REC.Usual story of humans zombies infecting one another with the "disease" and standard chaos ensues. The only difference here is that instead of a world wide pandemic the action takes place inside a small block of apartments.This is handy as it builds up the claustrophobic tension.PLOT: TV crew follow a group of firemen for the night filming their activities and it all goes swimmingly until they are called to a disturbance in the most run down block of apartments in history which are inhabited by the usual horror movie character clichés Once all the clichés are rounded up in the main entrance we learn that there is a nuclear threat from some guys in space suits and they all need to give a blood sample (WTF nuclear blood!!) to prove that they are clean.A group of arrogant Americans are unable to stand still for long enough to allow this simple procedure to take place and amongst the chaos that they mostly created for themselves the one infected old woman manages to start the contagious "pass the infection on" game.The Spanish version managed to do this with a smaller cast, noticeably smaller budget, little blood splattering violence that American Horror films have come to know and over use and with this they created a film that was scary as hell, with a real sense of panic amongst the entire cast.The American version screwed up the two most successful scares in the Spanish version in an almost scene for scene remake.The Americans had a larger cast but only to serve the purpose of killing them off in the most violent ways possible. The key fact that the American version missed out on is violence does not make for a scary film. It is the build-up of tension and suspense which make the scares more enhanced when they do come :O Overall I would give: REC 9/10 as it is one hell of a film Quarantine 6/10 as it was a pointless remake of a Spanish film for the sole reason that it would make more money if it were in English to an English Speaking audience. The fact that the last scene of Quarantine ended with a bra and cleavage shot shows that Americas do not actually have a clue when it comes to making good horror movies any longer which is a shame</fullReview>

The trailers and commercials made the movie seem really great, but when I saw it, it was nothing like those. Also, there is no suspenseful music in the background of any scenes. It was all talking, and at times it got boring. Another thing is that in the beginning of the movie I was not able to understand what was actually going on because the movie was going too fast, but it got easier to understand.</fullReview>

The first part of the movie is slow with sloppy acting then boom we got a scary fast pace horror movie. With the running around and confusion going on the script become believable. I found the first half of the movie is a 3 out of 10. The movie's second half is a 9 on the scare meter. In total I give the movie a 6 out of 10. A good movie rental or pay per view.

		<fullReview>This review will probably be split up into two parts, one will be comparing it to REC, and the other will be looking at the film on it's own. Because Quarantine could be one of the most underrated horror films of the last decade. Hated for one reason and one reason only, it's a remake.Now to be fair, when I say remake, I mean shot for shot remake. There are a few differences, but for the most part this movie is movie is very similar to REC. Now this didn't bother me because I saw Quarantine first, and when I did see REC, having seen Quarantine first didn't hurt my enjoyment of that movie. Both films do things that are better than the others. REC was a little more realistic, Quarantine gave us more time to get to know the characters in the beginning, REC had a less annoying main character, but Quarantine had a better Cameraman (seriously the cameraman in REC didn't do anything). Both have good acting, a creepy atmosphere, and some pretty scary moments. I know a lot of people hate Quarantine because it's an American remake. But that's how I found out about REC in the first place.As a movie on itself, Quarantine does have a few problems. It is a little slow in the beginning, the main character was a bit annoying at times, and I think Korey of Spill.com said it best, "What kind of apartment complex is this f**king creepy, doesn't anybody have lights." Yeah, that was one aspect of REC that was better. And of course they gave away the ending on the poster, trailer, and DVD cover. It's a cool shot but why. But overall I really liked Quarantine, it's got a great atmosphere, I care about the characters, the make up effects are fantastic, it has some pretty scary moments, and while the ending was ruined, I did still find it pretty creepy.Is REC technically better, yeah, but I prefer Quarantine. Now listen, I don't have a problem with subtitles, they are fine, but just because something is remade in English doesn't mean American's are stupid. Quarantine does do a few things better than it's Spanish counterpart, and doesn't deserve the hate it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Quarantine pushes the senses... making Blairwitch look like Gilligan's Island..." - Tom Millan "Kindred Gem Films 1998"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great acting in this psychological and literal "horror fest". Jennifer Carpenter's performance was riveting with a final score of excellent... All of the other actors, no exceptions, were well versed and played their roles with the utmost sincerity and intrigue- they were more than believable. Great directing as well in this feature as they paid extreme attention to detail, leaving no stone unturned when it came to all of the technical audio and visual aspects of this film.. Jennifer Carpenter, infamously known as Deborah Morgan on "Dexter", does a 180 degree turn in this film to play an innocent and excited TV reporter caught in a horrific situation. Her and her camera man tag along with firefighters who end up at an apartment which soon ends up becoming infested with a rash of rabies driven psychos. The film is extremely visceral and dark. As well done as this movie was I thought some of the madness and dark elements of the film went over the top. It was overdone. What is horrific of the film is not only the literal elements, but the psychological features it provides. The viewer is powerless to stop the mayhem that unravels around the characters and may even desire, more than once, to jump into the screen to rescue the characters- bringing them back into the safe haven of the living room. But that doesn't happen. With the extreme anger and rage between people, plus confusion, fear and panic- the viewer is helpless as bodies begin to drop by viral infected savages. These are some of the elements that can cause visceral stress to some viewers and should seriously not be viewed by the faint hearted. Some viewers may even get sick.Another psychological element of the film which can be stressing and perhaps troublesome to some is the threat of a real outbreak of biological terror by some strange religious cult. This is quite prevalent with examples of David Koresh and the Branch Davidians, or the Manson Family of the 1960's, or the religious cult in Japan who tried to release a doomsday virus in the subway system some years back. The makeup and stunts are extremely believable and the extreme violence and emotion is not to be underestimated in this film. This film does not mess around. The beginning is slow paced, giving the viewer the chance to know all of the characters and grow somewhat attached to some, depending on the viewer. Make no mistake: once the film picks up speed be prepared to go on a visceral, gory, disturbing and extremely violent roller coaster ride- which won't stop until the very end.. The viewer becomes helpless to stop the onslaught of increasing tension, hostility and violence which, to some viewers, may only increase their depression levels. The viewer is powerless to stop it.This is why the film is so well done. It is not for everyone. "Quarantine" tests the senses and pushes the viewers emotions over the edge. That's raw and real the acting and directing is. I docked a point because as I said before some of the elements are overdone. This is the third film I have seen which uses the "Blairwitch" style of film making which entails a "one eye" view from the camera. "Cloverfield" was another film which used this style- another film which was well executed in my opinion. Giving the movie a bad rating because it freaked you out is not a proper rating. Rate the film on it's artistic merits. Rate the film when it comes to the writing, directing, acting and technical avenues such as sound, lighting, blocking etc.I was impressed with this film.

		<fullReview>i've been wanting to see this for a few months now... and i was not disappointed at all,, this one was worth the wait, this movie i believe was done in the style of Blair Witch Project. i loved that steady hand cam very nice touch, what i guess i liked so much was the not knowing what was wrong with the people,, i mean you see a rat,, then they say maybe infected dog,, the building get's shutdown tight,, police , fire, then comes theCDC. they quarantine the entire building, nobody in or out,, the government is interested in saving the survivors,, they are waiting for , them to die, the whole apartment building is infected. what i also liked abuot this film is that is fresh faces,, all relatively unknown actors and actresses,, with stars you tend to get way over the top over-dramatic performances. this is a nice neat little perfect film that is one heck of a ride, and that i would recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Maybe a spoiler*** This movie started very slow. My husband kept asking me if I put the wrong DVD in! Yawn... Then it got a wee bit better. We kept our fingers crossed hoping for a payoff! Then it completely fell apart and was so, so annoying. The ending with the cult and the cult apartment was extra annoying! Just shove some sort of weird idea in the plot hole to fill it up... What a waste of time. I don't expect much out of "Horror movies". I was way happier with the likes of Cloverfield, Bubba Ho Tep, that movie about chicks in a cave etc... I can suspend reality with the best of them. But this movie did not make the grade. I gave it a four out of ten and was very happy I checked it out from our library and didn't pay any money at the box office or rental store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rip-off of "Rec"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a rip-off of the Spanish film "Rec" where a reporter &amp; a camera-man shadowing a couple of firefighters on a call to an apt. building find themselves quarantined as the residents are infected with a strange disease. Unlike in "Rec" the camera work is terrible. It really gives you a headache watching it. Even in the parts where there is no fast action, the quick in &amp; out zooms &amp; the poor framing is unbelievably bad. I mean the character is supposed to be a professional cameraman, not some kid with a camcorder. It's kind of like "The Blair Witch Project" meets "Resident Evil".For some reason, Hollywoood thinks Americans either can't or won't read subtitles, but trust me, "Rec" is 100 times better &amp; there is so much action &amp; twists that you won't even have to look at the subtitles (or you could just watch it dubbed in English). The concept of the film, being trapped in your own home, stalked by a rampaging disease is interesting. However, I suggest you stick to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slow to get going, but when it gets down to business QUARANTINE from Drew and John E. Dowdle, you find yourself flinching and sinking down in your seat. Sometimes its what you don't see, but expect to see that scares you. Television reporter Angela Vidal(Jennifer Carpenter)and her cameraman Scott(Steve Harris)decides to ride-along and get some behind the scenes footage of a Los Angeles fire station crew. They answer what appears to be a routine 911 call responding to screams from an old apartment building. They find themselves surrounded by residents of the complex infected with a deadly mutant virus. The CDC has quarantined the building as the rescue crew with no access to info from the outside are repeatedly attacked. After the quarantine is lifted, the only evidence of what went on inside is provided by the TV crew's chilling footage.Some pretty disturbing and graphic images. Of course, who doesn't get a little jumpy in total darkness? Also in the cast: Columbus Short, Greg Germann, Johnathon Schaech and Rade Serbedzja.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a thrill ride! I thought this was a terrifying movie. To me, it was a hybrid of the old David Cronenburg's "Rabid"s which I thought was more a vehicle to sell Maryiln Chamber's sexuality but nevertheless was pretty horrific and the new modern day "Right at your Front Door" movie that was stimulating but not all that horrific but the concept was certainly borrowed in this movie. All in all, the sum of both parts exceeded the sum and turned to be much better than either one.At any rate, I was scared and being 59 yrs old having grown up with Halloween and Friday the 13th, this movie was not juvenile nor irrelevant.For a horror movie only, I would give it a solid 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director: John Erick DowdleStars: Jennifer Carpenter, Steve Harris, Jay Hernandez, Johnathon Schaech, Columbus ShortSynopsis: A TV reporter and her cameraman are assigned to shadow a firehouse to do a piece on life as a fireman. They accompany the team on a call that takes them to a ramshackle apartment building where a woman's agonizing screams are heard. When the situation turns dire and they (and the occupants of the building) are quarantined they must get to the bottom of what's going on and survive the strange things happening around them.Thoughts: A remake of the Spanish film "Rec" (2007), "Quarantine" can be best described as "Cloverfield" meets "28 Days Later". Told from the perspective of the cameraman you get all the usually bounce and jerkiness associated with films like "The Blair Witch Project". It's a simple set-up: a small group must survive the nasty goings-on of a cramped and nasty location. It's done to moderate success as there are plenty of jump scares and situational suspense. It even manages to muster up a bit of an atmosphere but like most of the features filmed in this style you sometimes need to struggle to se what's going on and that sometimes it'll leave you frustrated while seeing the "goods". "Quarantine" is a solid but unexceptional remake that delivers the goods with limited effect. 3.5 / 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That was a fun ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Small spoilers, but nothing the title itself doesn't imply.) I often find myself reviewing the reviewers for films like this. Who in their right mind rates a film like this a 10 (up with "Citizen Kane" or "The Godfather")? Or similarly, a 1 (down with "Manos, the Hands of Fate").This was a watchable movie. Not my favorite, but not a waste of the watching time. I have to admit, there's the typical stupid actions on the part of the victims in movies like this. Like the cliché behaviour in slasher films where head to their doom saying "eek! a man with a chainsaw! Let me hide behind a wooden door in the basement!" There's a little of that in "Quarantine," but I think some of the complaints were un-warranted.One reviewer complained that no vet office would have animals in contact with others. That's not true of the typical small veterinary clinic. One of my best friends is a vet, and on any typical visit to his office there are minimum 2-3 pettable animals within reach. An animal just brought to the office might have the chance to attack one or two animals. And it happens fast. My dog got ripped half-way open when he walked near a tethered part-wolf dog, and the attack was unexpected and over in seconds.Disease incubation complaints were made against the film. Guess what? Real diseases are the same way. The infamous flu epidemic during WWI normally killed people after a few days. However, from exposure to death, for some people was a matter of hours.Summary: it isn't a 1, and isn't 10, but it's a good creepy ride. Rent it. Don't take it too seriously do the horror film thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary As Hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Quarantine back in October and it literally made me jump out of my seat. The beginning of the movie was scary, but the last half hour of this flick, holy hell!! Congrats to all the cast members, including Jennifer Carpenter(Exorcism of Emily Rose), Steve Harris, Columbus Short(Stomp the Yard), Johnathon Schaech(Prom Night), Dania Ramirez(Heroes) and Jay Hernandez(Lakeview Terrace and Hostel 1&amp;2) and the crew, who worked on this smash hit, i enjoyed every bit of it. It has a dark environment to it, because most of the movie is shot in the dark and there were murderous people jumping out at every turn, it just scared the hell out of me. Screen Gems released this, who also released Prom Night, The Covenant and When A Stranger Calls. This film is scary as hell, it definitely was a plus to see it on the big screen and I recommend this movie to everyone!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine is based on a simple concept - a TV crew (comprising perky girl frontman and cameraman) shadowing a firecrew for a fly-on-the wall TV show follow them to a building where screams have been heard. No sooner do they enter the building than the authorities arrive and prevent anyone leaving. It turns out that there is an extremely virulent rabies variant in the building which turns people into savage mindless flesh-ripping monsters pretty quickly after they've been bitten themselves. So the question is which order will the people locked in go down in, and will our pretty girl reporter survive? This film's main strength - the simplicity and power of the basic concept - also leads into its main weakness. Some care is taken at the start to present the main characters to us at the fire station - we meet them, get to know a little about them, and like them - but then, once the mayhem starts, we have what one might call the Cloverfield problem: hand-held camera and low light mean that it is difficult to follow what is happening, and to who. This undoubtedly adds to the cine-verite feel of the film but there are times when it becomes frustrating.The largely unknown cast does well (the only one I recognised was Greg Germann, Richard Fish from Allie McBeal), although Jennifer Carpenter becomes a little wearing in the closing ten minutes or so - not her fault, and very well performed, but I'd had enough by the end.Talking of the last ten or fifteen minutes, I thought this was the weakest section. There is some business with a reel to reel tape recording which gave the impression that some explanation would be forthcoming, but nothing was needed, so why even go there? And how come the machine worked when the power was off? And why didn't the camera operator recognise that the sound might mean that the tape recorder should be switched to a faster speed? I was also a little bemused by the fact that the quasi-rabies virus appeared to cause the victims to sprout zombie teeth (insofar as you were ever able to get a clear look at them). And there was a shot in the trailer which should NOT have been there as it caused a major spoiler for the ending.I must also say that there was some laughing in the cinema at some of the more violent, brutal parts, although this might be a comment on the audience rather than the movie itself, which managed to be atmospheric, tense, and realistic from the moment the incidents in the apartment building started.This was a decent horror - it delivered on its promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the original movie (REC), so I can not make comparisons to that film, but I have several observations to make about this one. As a synopsis: This film is a combination of 28 Days Later and Right At Your Door with just a sprinkling of Cloverfield for ambiance. I am not criticizing John Erick Dowdle for lifting these story lines/elements because the end result is a very entertaining and disturbing movie. It was released before Halloween and was, I believe, the perfect movie to compliment the celebration. The Director maintains and builds suspense from the beginning to the end and although none of the story elements are exactly unique they are presented with excellent craft. The one criticism I do have is Jennifer Carpenter, who becomes progressively hysterical and irritating. Well before the finish I was silently asking for her to become a victim, either by the enemy or her fellow captives. Alas, this did not happen. I loved her in Dexter, so I am not necessarily saying her acting was at fault. The rest of the cast does a more than passable job of acting the rat in a cage. I definitely recommend this movie especially around Halloween or as a midnight movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but rarely chilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Quarantine" is a remake of the Spanish film "Rec", which has gained a large cult following and even plenty of critical appreciation. I unfortunately was busy during "Rec"'s only screening in my city so I went into "Quarantine" without being able to compare it to the original film. I imagine the original film is fairly similar, given that the film is shot from the perspective of a news crew, but the acting and writing may very well be quite different, and perhaps better.I suppose it would be incorrect to call "Quarantine" a zombie movie, as the 'zombies' are still technically alive, but considering what the 'zombies' do in the movie they are still basically zombies. They bite, they groan, and do other zombie-like things. The movie opens with a news crew shooting a special on the local fire department. Late that night the department gets a call, they respond, the news crew and the firemen enter the building where there is some rabies-like disease spreading and end up trapped in there, 'quarantined' if you will. The first few scenes at the fire department have already been compared to the similarly uneventful opening scenes in "Cloverfield", but Drew Goddard's script for that film was far, far superior to this one, which is packed with stilted, unrealistic dialogue. Of course, people complained about the characters in "Cloverfield" being annoying, because they could have been real people, they talked like real people, and were annoying like most real people are, so I imagine those people will be pleased that we get CHARACTERS here. Yep, CHARACTERS defined by the character outlines. Simply not very good writing.All that said, the first stages of the film are actually quite engaging and suspenseful, and the development of the events at the quarantined building is very intriguing, and the first few kills are pretty surprising and fun. Of course, the camera does shake quite often in "Quarantine", but other than the last half hour which sees the movie degenerate from suspenseful horror thriller to what a faithful "House of the Dead" movie might have looked like (it literally largely consists of zombies randomly appearing in front of the camera, and at one point I instinctively pressed on my coke bottle; I must have been subconsciously reminded of the experience of playing that game at arcades), with all the motion you can expect from that sort of perspective, the camera is relatively un-shaky compared to "Blair Witch" or "Cloverfield". The most relevant comparison is to "Diary of the Dead" (both zombie movies shot this way), and there's really no question that "Quarantine" is superior in almost every way imaginable to Romero's latest (disappointing) effort."Quarantine" gets off to a reasonable start, picks up some real momentum, then turns into a live action video game, and as everyone knows it's no fun watching others playing a video game, and the lead actress' histrionics get quite aggravating. The movie on the whole is short enough to be harmless and entertaining, but given the quality of the concept and the middle section of the film, I'm disappointed that the director and writers missed the chance to make this a genuinely chilling and claustrophobic film, and it really ends up being more an action film than a horror film.Oh, and there's an absolutely shameful ripoff of the greatest 'jump' moment of all time from Robert Wise's 1963 film "The Haunting".6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>actually, I thought it was great. That's mostly because the virus in the movie was realistic because it resembled rabies so much. I was pretty shook up and that's saying a lot because I hate horror movies made nowadays because they are all extremely lame and cheesy. A movie like this really makes you think of all the possibilities of a virus spreading or an outbreak of rabies. Also, it makes you wonder if the government would really lock you up and ignore what happened, LIE about what happened.It's a remake, yes (maybe not even as good as the original), but the last one wasn't in English so this was a good chance for people who don;t like subtitled films to watch such a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is with all the hate for this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guys, just because it's an American remake doesn't automatically mean it will be crap.It's NOT a shot for shot remake, either. The tweaks, little changes, added scares, and altered reason for why it's happening in the first place addressed the original's weak spots and fixed them to great effect. The elevator sequence in particular was a fantastic addition. Once the horror starts, it just doesn't let go. Before you get a real chance to breathe, the next shock/disturbing image slaps you in the face in a truly frightening way. I also preferred Jennifer Carpenter's performance as Angela to the original Spanish actress. The Spanish actress was good, don't get me wrong, but the progression from a like-able girl with a bit of fire and wit to her to a bundle of pure terror was better communicated by Carpenter. There were also a couple of small but very important additions that gave us a better sense of her descent into hysteria than in the original.A couple of guys took a great horror film and made it better, so what the hell is everyone's problem? Obviously if you don't like the shaky-cam style then this movie isn't for you, which is your issue, not the movie's. There IS a story, you just have to PAY ATTENTION to catch it, because this movie gets very frantic for very justifiable reasons. Everyone just needs to calm down and stop looking for ridiculous reasons to hate a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Edge Of Your Seat Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time this movie is finished you're almost exhausted! This is truly a movie that, aside from the first few scenes, really does keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next bit of horror to envelop both the characters and you, the viewer. Those opening first few scenes are really quite effective in and of themselves as well. They establish the basic structure of the movie. Angela (wonderfully played by Jennifer Carpenter) is a TV reporter who's doing a ride-along with a couple of LA fire fighters one night. Those opening first scenes are shot in the firehouse, and consist mostly of light banter between the crew and the firemen, and actually some interesting footage of an LA fire station, while Angela hopes for a call that will give some good footage for her station. When the call comes, she (and the fire fighters) are totally unprepared for it.The call is to an old building, where an elderly woman is locked in her apartment and won't come out. When the police and firemen finally break down the door they discover the woman clearly sick and out of her mind with what is obviously a rabies-type virus that causes victims to become extremely violent. She ends up having to be shot, and then everyone discovers that the building has been sealed off by the authorities. No one's being allowed out and the virus is starting to spread very quickly - the movie establishing that symptoms start to show up within an hour of exposure. Is there any hope that anyone could survive this?Essentially, this is filmed in the style of "The Blair Witch Project." Angela's cameraman carries his camera everywhere through the mounting terror and eventually gets a video record of it that presumably is going to be found at some point once the authorities get into the building. The movie itself is far more exciting than "The Blair Witch Project" was. I spent significant time on the edge of my seat, because you truly have no idea what's coming next. Under the circumstances, the cameraman is perhaps a bit too conscientious. I don't know that I would have had the self-control to keep filming everything that was happening around me. That might have been a bit of a credibility problem here. The last few scenes are very effective. They offer a hint of an explanation as to what the virus might be (or at least where it might have come from) and the very last scene of the movie reminded me a little bit of the last scene of the movie "Descent" for anyone who's seen that film. It was a different type of scene (the last scene of "Descent" was very gentle and calm, while the last scene here is anything but) but both movies end very powerfully on notes of sheer hopelessness that really do leave you a bit drained. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror movies have two main goals. The first is make sleep with lights on in fear that whatever was in the film you just ACTUALLY happening to you (See: The Exorcist). The second goal is make you jump out of your seat. Quarantine excels at this. This unique horror film maximizes its setting, premise, and queasy-cam style to give its audience a hair-raising ride.The premise may seem like a simple zombie film, but in all honesty it isn't. Not only do the "zombies" NEVER actually die its unclear until the film's end just what caused the incident. When we do find out just what (or who??) probably was responsible it leads to by far the film's most chilling moment. The feeling of paranoia and claustrophobia is thrilling when you consider that the entire film takes place inside a apartment complex. The film has no standout performances but it is well-acted considering it sort of a difficult acting element with the camera.There is way to much down time in the first half of the film . There are one to many moments were we wait for the scare but never get it. It sorta feels like a waste of time. In all honesty it isn't that big of a deficit. The violence and gore in the film is frequent but not necessarily inventive. The films best moment of violence actually isn't seen, involves a dog, sprinting into an elevator. You'll have to watch. Id rather no ruin it.All in all Quarantine is a very good film that's pretty fun and quite scary. It certainly has its' unique aspects, and it stands alone as different, unflinching horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good one this movie, which had me entertained more or less throughout."A television reporter and her cameraman are trapped inside a building quarantined by the CDC after the outbreak of a mysterious virus which turns humans into bloodthirsty killers."And what makes this movie even more compelling is the whole story is filmed through the lens of the cameraman doing a documentary type report, which adds significant realism to the film.The picture is often genuinely scary and horrific, there are no unnecessary sub-plots, and all the actors are convincing and enthusiastic in their roles including the lead female despite her increasing hysteria as the film reaches its climax. The story itself is not so far fetched either and is both reasoned and contains a ring of truth as to what could happen.It is the type of film that might have a cult following in more ways than one,and in my opinion deserves high marks:8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously, this is not Cloverfield. Its form is not as smooth and thought-through, the dialog isn't as memorable, and information isn't revealed in the same manner... in short, the J.J.(well, when the man is at his best, anyway) that was evident in aforementioned, is not here. That's fine, not everything has to be done by him(there certainly are people who'd petition against that). Also, they realize this, and do the smart thing: They don't try to copy him, but rather go in a different direction, albeit using the same basic tool. The POV-film is incredible, specifically for horror, if done right. And they sure knew what they were doing, here. How to use the camera, and they particularly worked on the sound, too, which comes off completely natural. The execution was quite good. This doesn't take off immediately, however, once it does, it does not let up. The pacing is fitting. The tone is spot-on and consistent, more or less throughout. The characters are credible and well-written, and their on-screen development does not come off as forced. This can be very effective, the most well-done of the shocks ought to have you jumping in your seat. The least of them tend to not be too bad. This is genuinely suspenseful, instead of just bombarding the audience with gore. The realism is high in this. It has irony, bordering on satire, as well, mainly of the genre and its many clichés. The cinematography and planning are almost invariably great, with a couple of downright golden moments. There is harsh language in all of this, as well as some strong violence(including a few gruesome bits) and/or disturbing content. It was refreshing to see so little(next to no) nudity, much less sexuality, in a new release of this kind. I recommend this to fans of this type of movie, and I'd say that if you go in for an atmospheric, scary flick, and don't expect this to redefine your view of the world, you're likely to largely enjoy the heck out of those 90 minutes(I would advise only watching trailers and, to a lesser extent, looking at the cover if you can forget or at least not think about one particular popularly used image, lest it spoil a surprise). 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too intelligent a story but scary anyway. I was entertained.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a first rate fright-fest. It started out as kind of silly and goofy when the Jennifer Carpenter and the cameraman enter the Fire Department. Due to the commercial making a dead giveaway and the no "evidence" written on the movie poster, here I am thinking, that this fine young woman is going to die. I really wish she didn't just because she was too attractive. The biggest flaw of this film was the trailers. It was a Cloverfield type of movie, but at least Cloverfield left me guessing on what happened. I knew in the beginning that there was no hope. This movie became progressively scarier up until the very end. Direction was good at keeping in the intensity. The rabid vampire-zombie creatures were kind of repetitive as seen in I Am Legend, 28 Days Later, and Dawn Of The Dead. Another thing was that this is a remake of a Spanish title from last year. The actors didn't apply much common sense in their roles and they make a lot of stupid horror movie mistakes. Like victims going up the stairs to check on their dog. Victims just hanging around the infected monsters without giving a thought that the monsters could kill them. One scene where a cop is trying to inject a sedative in a little girl who already mutated, even though she already bit and infected her mother. The cop then lets his guard down, like any bad cop would do, and she comes running in to bite his neck. Also like when the last remaining were in too much of a hurry to run out into the dangerous hallways. Even though they were safe in the room they were in. In reality, that cameraman should have put his darn camera down even though it wouldn't have been much of a movie without it. Overall, this was a still quality film, and it makes me want to see the Spanish version in which I hear is a little bit better. Jennifer Carpenter gave her emotions for us to feed off of, her fear and her almost obnoxious hysteria in the movie made this movie scary. I enjoyed it overall. I think a 7 is a modest score for this film. It is one of the frightening I've seen this year. The fighting back was kind of cool. That dog was kind of scary with that wicked drool. Nice little quick thrill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Film of 2008!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off for being a remake this film really lives up to the original, but lacks a bit of explanations on how it all started but that didn't stop me from enjoying this film one bit. The film opens on Angela Vidal played by Jennifer Carpenter whom you may remember from The Excerisam of Emily rose and White chicks. Her camera man Scott played by Steve Harris. They are a news crew doing a report on the L.A fire department. They meet a few Firemen named Jake played by Jay Hernandez and Fireman fletcher played by Johnathon schaech. After a while all seems normal and then they get a call....Once on the scene they discover some Terrified residents and some police men, Columbus short, Greg Germann, Dania Ramirez, Rade Sherbedgia and a few others. They say an old woman was heard screaming. She begins infecting others and that is were the Quarantine begins. With no explanation on why the terrified people soon dicover there is mutch more going around then just infection. With non stop action and enough thrills for two movies this film is a must see!

		<shortDescription>DARE you see Quarantine!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the most frightening film I have watched in years. Taps into the primal fear of Darkness and Claustrophobia, and is mainly down to the brilliant acting of Jennifer Carpenter who portrays her character so believable, that you actually think you would react in the most terrifying moments that she encounters. Although films like this have already been done before, (e.g. Cloverfield, 28 Days Later, The Blair Witch Project) but the camera work and execution throughout the film is excellent, and I was on the edge of my seat throughout, and scared to death of where the camera will turn to next. The running time is only an hour and a half, so it flies by, and BOY you want it to fly by because this is a very unpleasant film in places (watch out for the body that drops out of no-where).The screaming towards the end of the film does get slightly out of hand, but you just have to sympathise with the characters in the film, that you wouldn't have to care. And the last ten minutes of the film is relentless, with the final sequence destined to be in your head for weeks!I would strongly recommend you to go and see this film, once it has been released in the U.K. (14th November), but as long as you have a strong stomach, not suffering from any slight of epilepsy (due to the shaky camera work).But I enjoyed it and was scared to death. A brilliant remake of last years Spanish horror film 'Rec'.DARE you see Quarantine!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start out with my biggest complaint first. Camera shake. I have taken my cheap 400$ cam on rollercoasters "no joke" and they look smoother than this. Not only has this tactic been used many times, in Qaurintine the camera is a shoulder held HD with Super steady shot and a supposed pro TV cameraman. The shake is so intense that you can't see a damn thing and you will get sick. My girl had to leave for 10 min because she got a headache. Enuff with the so called "realistic shooting". It is totally overdone and ruins the ENTIRE film. I think i may have seen some awesome make up fx in there but i'm not sure. How am i to get scared when i can't see what the F is going on. Zoom in zoom out, zoom in zoom out..... what Pro TV Cameraman does that? Complain #2. If caveman made fire...can't we now? Duh. Complaint #3. When in the various rooms, why not look for a weapon? Anything. Pick up a telephone and hit one over the head. Give me a stapler. I'll staple their eyes and mouth shut if i have to. Complaint #4. When using the night shot at the end, why keep the camera on Jenny Carpenter and not the amazingly creepy old rabid freak? Ummmmmm i'd want to know where that dude is every second. I guess not being a layman makes it just too hard for me to watch new horror films. Sorry folks i could not enjoy the film because i was way too angry. Maybe if the writers and Director spent more time on what humans would actually do in a situation like this and less effort on how to make the camera shake as much as possible they would have had a really cool film. Things i did like- the casting and idea. I also like that there is no stupid rock music to help "pump it up". With a re-edit, i'd love this film. Maybe an un-cut DVD with a sharp picture will make me happy:]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who shows the ending in the movie trailer?!?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was well done. It had me hold on to my boyfriend's hand a lot and plug my ears. It's definitely a worthwhile experience for horror fans to see it in theaters. There was enough blood and gore, thrills and chills, and surprising moments to keep you in your seat with your eyes glued to the screen. There was only one problem with it which is the reason I only gave it 9/10 stars: the ending. I know that not every movie can have a happy fairytale ending, but everyone dying/turning into mindless killing machines was not a crowd-pleasing way to end the movie.Like many movies before this one, there are added scenes that are included in movie trailers and commercials to make a movie more interesting. When I saw the lead actress get pulled away in night vision mode by the infected people, I figured that this was an added scene to make the movie look scarier than it is. However, in reality, this is the ending of the movie which was the one bad thing about Quarantine. The movie abruptly ends without rhyme or reason leaving many loose strings such as what eventually happened to the building, did the virus become a worldwide epidemic, was a cure eventually found to cure the virus, etc. I know that movies to some extent need to have unanswered questions with answers that are in the imaginary minds of the viewers. However, this movie ended too quickly leaving too many unanswered questions that make it difficult to make an ending out of imagination.Nevertheless, it was for the most part an entertaining horror flick that makes me want to see the original one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im a big horror fan but the last time a movie actually scared or disturbed me was The Strangers. Since then times have changed and instead of a compelling story and suspense, we're given bucket loads of gore and told that that is what makes a good horror.Like The Strangers, Quarantine is full of suspense with a fantastic score and very little gore. A young reporter is shadowing the fire department when their first call takes them to an apartment building where there have been reports of one the residents screaming. On arrival to the building this resident attacks one of the policeman, taking a bite out of him. Suddenly the CDC secure the building with no explanation as to why and so the mayhem begins.Im not a Zombie fan which is why i think i enjoyed this movie as much as i did because it's nothing like the usual Zombie stories with brain-dead people running around trying to eat people's brains. Instead Quarantine presents us with a very scary movie about disease and how this disease effects people.I saw this on DVD in the middle of the day and found it quite scary. I wish though that i had gone to the cinema to see it when it was showing because if i had, i can without any shadow of doubt say that i would have been terrified! If you plan on seeing this movie then start it as i did, without any preconception or expectations. Turn out all the lights, turn up the volume and if you do then i promise you that you will be in for one of the scariest movie experiences you've had in a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert.OK I've not seen REC the movie which this is a remake of so I went into Quarantined knowing nothing other than it was a horror movie.I was not disappointed unlike many. The movie was a pleasant surprise for the horror genre which all to often falls back on lots of gore, and stuff popping onto the screen to try to startle you.This horror movie does it right from the beginning. You actually get to know, and even like the main character a little bit before the "zombie" action starts.I think the idea behind this movie could be summed up as an attempt to make a "realistic" zombie horror movie. Your brain isn't constantly trying to resist ridiculous sci-fi excuses for zombies, nor are you asked just to accept infectious mindless killers as a plot element and move on.This is a more slow burning approach with a plausible explanation woven in that isn't a 30 second part of a 1.5 hr movie. Even to the end I came out feeling, "Yes this could happen in today's world, there are no sharp edges jutting out of the plot which couldn't happen." On the technical side, the use of lighting was very good and the rising feel of panic as light becomes ever more scarce is a clever tactic used by the director. The other tactic which I liked was that you got to see the human side of a number of the zombies before they turned.The movie itself may not be a blockbuster but I think it is something that the genre should aspire to be as good as on the plot and technical side.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original, REC, a couple of months ago. It's a very good movie, keeps you on your toes the whole movie. I just got so disappointed when I heard about this remake. Can't Americans learn to appreciate foreign films? Is it really that hard to read subtitles? This is just a stupid remake with nothing to hold up against the original... I rate "REC" at 8 and this at 4, it's only half as good. Just embarrassing that they made this movie! In this version the characters are just vague copies of the original with none of the depth of the Spanish counterparts. When I think back on the original and compare, I want to lower the grade to a 3 instead...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quarentine is a fantastic thrill ride that builds gradually and then doesn't let up. The point of view camera added a cinema verte feel to the whole piece that throws the viewer into the action. Unlike a lot of horror films Quarentine doesn't rely on comic relief because it is assumed that this is all really happening. Another reason this is great film is that it is scary as hell. Even a half an hour after the movie was over my body was shaking. The hysterical nature of the film causes the viewer to be stressed out and in my opinion the best horror films are the ones that cause anxiety and panic. If this movie doesn't make you grab your heart a few times, you don't have one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, and Diary of the Dead. and I'm sure anyone who has watched those movies will almost immediately compare Quarantine to them, like I do.Make no mistake that Quarantine is mostly just a chop-up of other famous horror/suspense titles that are pasted together. The feel of the movie is similar to Blair Witch, the look is similar to Cloverfield, the "zombies" are very similar to what we see in 28 Days Later/28 Weeks later. Although this movie seem to copy/paste a lot, it does it rather well and manages to make a fairly original feel, but just barely.However there is a element to the film that makes it rather original from the other films of similar ilk. Unlike the three aforementioned titles this film is not a long event that takes place over several cuts of the camera. Instead, Quarantine has almost no break in the action (there are breaks were the camera is turned off but these breaks are very brief) This basically means that you are always on the edge of your seat. Always. There's no long dramatic narrations and dialogs either, everything is fast-paced but not too fast that you, the viewer don't pick up on vital information. From start to finish it's a non-stop 100 minute ride. That, by far, is what I think to be the movies biggest merit, mainly because it greatly heightens realism.One other thing I feel I should mention is that the acting in this movie is brilliant. No really, I think it is. I know that horror movies are often panned for lousy acting (which more often that not is justified) but this movie's cast is really good and you'll almost forget that this is a movie.All in all. A fantastic movie if your looking for a good scare. There will be plenty of opportunity for you to be jumping off your seat and screaming in shock.</fullReview>

How many movies did they borrow from to piece that together: Countless zombie flicks, The Descent, The Grudge, Cloverfield, The Blair Witch. There were plot holes big enough to drive a train through. I can see why they didn't screen this movie for critics. Thank heavens it was less than 90 minutes, because it still felt like 3 hours.Well let's see, this has to be 10 lines.

The camera work was the most intriguing part of the movie because it made you feel a part of the movie seeing it from one of the characters point of view (which was the cameraman) Honestly i feel though this movie is only enjoyable if you watch it in the big screens or if you have a big screen TV at home because the thrill factor is less the smaller the screen is.

		<fullReview>Regardless of its derivative status (it's an American remake of a well-praised Spanish film that has yet to find Stateside distribution), its indulgence of the Found Footage subgenre (recently seen in action in "Cloverfield" and "Diary of the Dead"), and its countless steals from several generations of horror film ("The Silence of the Lambs," "28 Days/Weeks Later," "The Descent," and "The Crazies" are just a few obvious points of reference), nothing can change the fact that "Quarantine" is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen. This is not something I say lightly?as a lifelong fan of the genre, I have sought out the rare, the obscure, and the downright stupid to satiate my inner horror geek?yet few films have sent icily chilled shocks down my spine with such terrifying efficiency. Melding the "you-are-there" POV of hand-held camera, and our post-9/11 fears of biological warfare hitting home, with the current trend of "fast zombie" films, "Quarantine"'s method is the key to its madness (and its impossible-to-suppress effect), and a mere synopsis does the film a great injustice?like other films that push their extremes to surprising levels, this is something to be seen and experienced. And while arbiters of criticism who insist that a motion picture contain some virtue and redemption will condemn "Quarantine" based solely on its nihilism and outcome (the title alone pretty much rules out a Happy Ending), the inevitable unravels with skilled craftsmanship (indeed, it takes a skilled craftsman to make scripted shocks seem off-the-cuff) in a jigsaw-puzzle assembly of "clues" that flash in the background, documents briefly glimpsed on tables, and anachronistic attic rooms that mirror the mad-scientist setups of the Atomic Age without a lick of postmodern irony. The characterizations are cursory, and sensibly so?extensive development would seriously retract the film's primary intention of unsettling the audience with a string of self-contained events that build to a horrifying crescendo (that being said, the non-marquee cast is a game bunch, and lends a refreshingly unglamourous realism that gels well with the proceedings)?throughout "Quarantine," we get the feeling that the events are happening to US as much as the fictional characters on-screen. And unlike other FF shockers like "Cannibal Holocaust," "The Blair Witch Project," and "Diary of the Dead," Dowdle's film (remake or not) succeeds so brilliantly because of its disinterest in the conventions of cinema?with no intention of making the film narratively or aesthetically palatable, "Quarantine" jumps headlong into a visceral abyss that, for 89 unrelenting minutes, shows the viewer no mercy. I'll admit that the final result left me with the beginnings of a motion-sick headache, but I'll be damned if it also didn't leave me more scared and unsettled than I'd ever been in a dark theater.</fullReview>

Quarantine did have it's moments, it did get my heart beating pretty fast in certain parts but overall it just wasn't that good a thrill. The acting and effects were well done, the hand-held camera work was a little irritating and made some of the parts hard to actually concentrate on just like Cloverfield, but overall not too bad. The movie just seemed to drag too long when there was no action and then the movie just seemed to end once the action finally took place.

		<fullReview>But I loved this one. I was watching it on my computer and I kept IMing a friend, telling him to hold me. Normally, I don't scare very easily. There are a few "boo" effects (where something pops up/jumps out suddenly), but they weren't the only things that made this scary.The suspense was amazing - so amazing, at times, I couldn't take it. Near the end of the movie (about fifteen minutes to the end), I had to actually pause it and turn the lights on. The rest of the time, I had my face inches from the screen, mouth agape.I would recommend watching this if you really want something that'll scare you - or at least entertain you for an hour and a half. Don't pay any attention to the people who give bad reviews of this - they either hate it because it's a remake or scream "unoriginal!!!" because it's z zombie movie where people are trapped in a building.I only have two real cons on the movie, neither of which should turn you away from it. First off, a lot of the movie was in the dark, making it hard to see at times. When done currently, it adds suspense. When done poorly, it just makes viewers have a hard time seeing what's going on. Secondly, Angela, the main character, got really annoying as the movie wore on. She "lost her marbles," whimpering and shaking and crying. Constantly. The acting was believable, but it was seriously overplayed. It sometimes sounded like she was having sex from the way she was going "Oh, ah. Oh, oh, oh God." All in all, it was a good movie. Something I'd watch again? Maybe in a few months. Not anytime soon, though. For now, I'm going to sleep with the lights on. All of them. Including my flashlights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, basic logic is unusually destructive here, even for a horror movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine starts off reasonably well, if not at all originally. A small film crew is doing a ride- along with the fire department to get a first hand look at what their daily professional lives are really like. The film is presented the film crew's unedited stock footage, so we get lots of video of the firemen acting not at all like firemen but instead like young men who are living in close quarters for long periods of time. Finally an interesting call comes in and the crew are called out to a building in town. Up to this point, the movie is presented in a style even more realistic than a documentary, because the footage that we see is not even edited. Once they arrive at the building, of course, weird things start happening.You know the premise, the movie is essentially a zombie movie, but a lot of the suspense and tension is predicated on the fact that this group of innocent people have been for some reason barricaded inside a building by the police, government, military, whatever. Soon we find out that it's the Center For Disease Control doing the quarantining, but the point is, the people that are meant to protect us are locking these innocent people inside a building and leaving them for dead and the people inside have no idea why.But here's my first question, how do you lock an entire modern fire crew inside an old, dilapidated building presumably made primarily of plaster and wood? Later they discover that approaching windows is enough to get yourself shot, but after what happened soon after they arrived at the building, I am willing to bet that none of those guys would have been willing to spend more than two or three minutes locked unwillingly inside the building.Next, it seems that breaking through plaster walls is not the only bit of standard fireman training that these guys are lacking. When people start getting hurt, at one point one of the firemen calls out, "Is there a doctor in the house?" I had been under the impression that in order to be a fireman you have to have some emergency medical treatment training, but I could be wrong. I had to do the training in order to be a summer camp counselor a couple years ago, but maybe sleep-away camps are just stricter than your typical major city fire department.Jennifer Carpenter is the lead character, the host of the documentary that the film crew was making. You may remember her from The Exorcism of Emily Rose, the astonishingly scary horror film that she starred in back in 2004. Sadly, Quarantine just doesn't have the story or the content to give her much to do except run around looking scared. Her performance as Emily Rose was one of the best horror performances I've ever seen, but Quarantine just gives the feeling that she's waiting for an opportunity or a good reason to do some real horror acting.Overall the movie is not bad, but it is overwhelmingly casual in its presentation of a typical horror movie, this time with the slight variation that all of the victims are trapped in close quarters with the zombies. They have zombies trying to get them inside the building, and humans on the outside pointing guns at the building to prevent any escape and outbreak of the virus causing the zombiness.There is an interesting scene where the cameraguy actually uses the camera to bludgeon one of the zombies to death, which provides a unique point of view. I had never seen a zombie killed in a movie like that before, but other than that there is just not much special about the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much shaky cam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually kind of liked this movie, even if it was tired retread stuff, it did make me jump. Unfortunately the shaky cam was so distracting that about halfway through I had serious motion sickness and that made it hard to focus. I would look away from the screen if it got too shaky, so I am sure I missed some stuff.Also, there were some parts, especially at the end, that it would have been nice if they'd fleshed it out a bit more. It was like, "Oh here's the likely explanation". Movie over.Maybe on a small screen it would be less nauseating. But I doubt I'll give it another go on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie! You will be scared!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie and it didn't exactly meet my expectations but I was expecting too much from it. Overall a very good movie and at least to me, it seemed possible that something like this could happen as you will see in the movie. A lot of people were saying that the camera work made them throw up or get headaches but I could see things clearly and I really felt like I was in there with them which added to all the suspense and horror. I jumped in my seat and banged my elbows on the armrest a few times throughout the movie and I can openly admit that I was really scared. Just make sure when you watch this movie, you have a good seat in the theater meaning fairly close to the screen and around the middle area because the right seat matters in this kind of movie and if someone talks to you, tell them to shut it or else you won't get into this movie. Go watch this movie, you will jump in your seat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but not great Remake of REC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got to see the American remake of REC which is QUARENTINE in a special screening here in Manhattan, NYC. I really expected worse, since I have already seen the great original version, REC on which this remake is based on. But I was pleaseantly surprised that this film didn't suck and was for the most part, almost as good as the original. The remake is an almost exact scene by scene copy of the original, but based in Los Angeles than in Barcelona, Spain where the events of the original REC happened. The only major differences in the remake are that there are more tenants than in the original, the cause of the virus is not supernaturally based as in REC, but a mutant strain of rabies; there is no Medieros girl in the climax in the attic but a very skinny and scary man in the attic played by Doug Jones(Hellboy) and the ethnic composition of the tenants in QUARENTINE is different than the one in REC and there are also about three new scary scenes in the remake that are not in REC such as the"elevator" scene. John Erick Dowdle and his brother,did a very good job adapting the original REC's story into the remake and there are some effectively directed scares in the film. My opinion about this fiim is that QUARENTINE is a good remake but not superior to REC, just like THE RING is a good remake of the original Japanese RINGU but not superior to it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let the beginning of the movie stop you from watching the whole thing. Granted the lead actress is obnoxious (but I knew this coming into the movie because I love Dexter, but hate that girl in it) When the movie started I was worried it was going to be cheesy throughout its entirety, about 20 min. into the movie I found out I was wrong. The whole concept of the movie was what kept me so interested. I wanted to find out why everything was happening and I loved the fact that you actually do get all your questions answered by the end of this movie. (unlike the strangers) Trust me, sometimes I like when movies force you to stay up all night replaying the scenes in your head trying to figure out "why?". But with Quarantine, you still think about the movie after it ends, just in a different way. I love scary movies and jump at every chance to see a possible real horror flick. I'd have to say that Quarantine was one of those good horror flicks. Just don't only listen to the people who are saying Quarantine isn't as good as its' original, because it doesn't have to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A competent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>REC is the best horror movie I have seen in 2008 (although its release date in Spain was in 2007).Many movies have used the trick of using an improvised and very realistic cinematography (like Diary of the Dead,directed by George A. Romero),but very few movies have used that trick on an intense and credible way.And,besides of that,REC had had natural performances and creepy situations.The final result was an excellent horror film with a lot of suspense,blood and tension.That great achievement was noticed by Hollywood and following their tradition,they decided to remake REC.I had very little expectations for this movie but it was much better than I expected and it is clearly beyond the average of Hollywood remakes.In other words : Quarantine is obviously very far away from the original film but,on its own merit,it is a competent movie.First,I'll mention the negative elements from this movie.There are various forced things on the screenplay and some scenes do not result as tense as they should be.Another disadvantage are the performances.I usually like the work of Jennifer Carpenter very much (specially,on the brilliant TV series Dexter) but she is too over the top on this movie and she was not natural at all.She felt like an actress trying to seem scared.Manuela Velasco,in the original film,had been completely natural and credible.The same that happens with Carpenter happens with the rest of the cast.And,although I liked this movie,it feels unnecessary...why fixing something which is not broken?.But this movie has many positive elements.As I said,Quarantine is a good movie on its own merit.Plus,very few people saw REC,so,for them,it will be an original experience.The story from this movie is well written (with the exception of some forced things) and the frenetic tone makes of it an entertaining movie.And the last take,although it was better done on the original film,results very tense and truly creepy.Quarantine is one of the best remakes from Hollywood of horror films,but that is not saying too much,because these remakes are usually crappy.REC is a much better film than Quarantine but I still can recommend it because,on its own merit,it kept me entertained and tense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quarantine part 1:Quarantine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With having watched the first two (and the shockingly bad third) tremendous films in the Rec series last October,I was pleased to recently find the US remake of the first Rec being sold in Poundland for a while pound!,which led to me getting ready to witness a new "Rec"ording in the series.The plot:For the latest episode of their TV series,news report Angela Vidal and cameraman Scott Percival visit a L.A. based fire station,where they plan to record an episode about the entire night that the firemen experience.Welcomed with open arms by the firemen,Angela and Scott are given a guided,detailed tour of the station,as the hours go past,and their appears to be little chance of an emergency call coming though in the night.Nearing the end of the night,the firemen suddenly get an emergency call about a woman who is making a number of weird news in her apartment block room.Feeling thrilled that they now have the opportunity to see the group in action,Angela and Scott closely keep up with all of the firemen.Entering the block with the assumption that the old woman just needs help in getting her nerves to calm down,the firemen,Scott and Angela soon discover that this recording/emergency call will be far deadlier then anything they ever expected.View on the film:Despite production designer Jon Gary Steele building an impressively complex set for the apartment block where 80% of the movie takes place in,co-writer/(along with his brother,Drew) director John Erick Dowdle and cinematography Ken Seng fail to create a claustrophobic atmosphere or any sense of gradually unravelling terror,due to making the apartment block overly lit,and using wide shots,which whilst allowing Steele's set to be fully shown,also stops anything appearing from a hidden corner of the building.Whilst keeping close to the original Rec (which neither of them mentions on the DVD commentary) for 80% of the movie,the screenplay by the Dowdle's takes a number of detours which help to give the movie a bit of a distinctive edge,thanks to the Dowdle's making the sharp resolution one that is based in reality and not in the Supernatural Horror world,and also doing very well at showing the real bond that each of the firemen (and Angela and Scott) have for each other,before the "Rec"ording really begins?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unwatchable "wooblycam" mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently this movie is a US remake of a 2007 Spanish horror movie called Rec. Consensus seems to be that the original was substantially better. Unfortunately US remakes of "foreign" movies tends to be made by producers that wants to make some quick cash and are not competent enough to come up with ideas of their own and as a result they are often dumber, sillier and generally not as good as the originals. Now I have not seen the original in this case but it couldn't really be much worse as far as I am concerned.This is another one of those movies that I had no idea what it was before I started to watch it. Sometimes you are pleasantly surprised when just jumping onto a movie like that but not this time. I do not like those wobbly handycam style movies where the picture jumps around all the time and this one is exactly one of those movies. It was incredibly tiresome to watch this mess.Now, if the movie had been really good otherwise the "wobblycam" might have been (almost) acceptable but it really was not. The script was just an illogical mess where people spent most of the time running around screaming while the guy with the "wobblycam" did his best to ? wobble around. People were acting totally illogical, especially the "professionals". A police officer and some firemen encounters a strangely behaving woman with foam around her mouth and extreme sensitivity to light and they just walk up to her and tries to talk soothingly? What kind of nonsense is that? No professionals in their right mind would do anything like that.After that really poor start the film just went downhill into a nonsensical mess with sporadic outbursts of gore and finally ended in an utterly unsatisfactory and ridiculous ending. It is not often I feel that way after having watched a movie but this time I felt it was a totally wasted evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film describes Quarantine perfectly showing true description of symptoms.The cast are amazing, Jennifer Carpenter does an amazing job portraying her role almost life like. Although in my opinion some of the cast were disappointing bringing the film down to a 9.I am sure if you liked 28 days later and the exorcism of Emily Rose this is a film for you. The film itself is full of jumpy moments, but the film brings great tension. The effects bring the whole film together - with so many things happening at once. This is a good remake of the Japanese and Spanish film.The film Quarantine 2 about an airport is related to this film it explains all the questions that had not been answered in the first movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RECognise this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot in the 'found footage' style made popular by The Blair Witch Project, everything that happens in Quarantine is seen through the lens of the video camera operated by Scott Percival (Steve Harris), cameraman for television reporter Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter).When an emergency call comes in while they are filming at a local fire-station, the intrepid pair tag along for the ride, unaware that the apartment building that they are about to enter is the breeding ground for a virulent disease, and that the authorities are about to seal the place up to prevent the infection spreading.Quarantine is a well crafted chiller that makes pretty good use of the hand-held shaky cam style, but being a virtual scene-for-scene-remake of Spanish horror hit REC, it also has to be one of the most redundant films that I have ever seen. Apart from one or two better effects?the benefit of a bigger budget?there is nothing about this film that validates its existence alongside the original (a film that I didn't rate all that highly in the first place).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>QUARANTINE (John Erick Dowdle, 2008) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I had not intended doing so, I ended up watching this right after the cult Spanish horror {.REC} (2007), of which this is a Hollywood remake. While I read comments that it was almost as good as the original, I immediately lost heart, firstly because of a distinctly overbearing, almost immature, protagonist (much more so, in fact, than {.REC}'s Manuela Velasco) played by Jennifer Carpenter (from THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE [2005], though not so that you would notice!).However, there was also the sheer obviousness of the re-imagining - such as making two of its key characters blacks (presumably so as not to elicit race-related criticisms from potential audiences where, in the Spanish film, a narcissistic old man was shamelessly shown passing disparaging remarks about Orientals!). While the film follows the original pretty faithfully, it inserts numerous embellishments which more often than not do not work, thus serve merely to stretch the running-time unnecessarily.Again, some of these are patent Hollywood trademarks: for instance, before the situation goes off the rails, the firemen make bets about whether they can bed Carpenter; the rabid dog only mentioned in {REC.} is still lurking in the condominium; one of the residents refuses to obey orders and suffers the consequences for his actions; perhaps borne out by the bigger budget afforded here, the number of people, amount of nationalities and infected victims concerned is larger (though, like I said, this adds very little of substance).Most importantly, then, the final revelation is not only drastically altered (making it an alien rather than diabolic takeover, involving as it does the so-called "Doomsday Cult"!) but so sketchily presented in this case as to go over the head of most viewers!! In the end, even if the violence is more pronounced in the remake, it is safe to assume that there will be no QUARANTINE 2...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spanish horror film REC far exceeds Quarentine in every way. Another case of an inferior Hollywood remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I might have liked Quarantine a little more if not for the fact that I kept telling myself, "REC did this so much better" while I was watching it. Basically, this is another case where Hollywood, void of original ideas, goes ahead and remakes the vastly superior original. REC is more frightening, more convincing, and overall a far better film. As a horror film I didn't think Quarantine was all that bad. However, it was mediocre compared to REC. When I first watched the Spanish horror film, REC it came across as a fresh and unique approach to horror. Quarantine mimics REC in a shot-for-shot manner. There's not much of a reason to choose Quarantine over REC if someone is interested in seeing the former except if they're lazy and don't want to read Spanish subtitles. REC really is the superior movie in every way imaginable. In my mind there's no doubt about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie, but a Stupid Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had really no intention of watching Quarantine, until my friend told me about, so I decided to give it a shot.A reporter, camera man, two fire men, and the residents of the apartment infected with rabies. As more and more people are reflected with rabies, they start to kill the people around them, until they, themselves, are killed. It was interesting how the movie had only one camera, which was the camera of the camera man. Having this, everything was shown more at the point of view of the people trapped in the apartment. However, this did get quite annoying. I would've liked to see the infected people at various different angles, and what was happening behind the camera man. Then also, there was a plot whole, that I couldn't quite make sense of.Analyzing the title, you can tell that I hate the ending. Sure, it was realistic, but it made me upset, and made the movie for me pointless. It didn't tie things up, and is the kind of ending the school teachers absolutely hate!Overall, I thought it was impressive, for a movie I'd never heard of, but it could have been a lot better, in many ways.</fullReview>

Some majorly bad acting by a couple of no names makes some parts just lame... but the leading lady, Jen Carpenter put on an incredible and intense performance as usual; truly masterful scream queen, in fact possibly the best screamer I've ever seen. Any way, you should check out this film, while it is predictable and less realistic than the writers would have liked, still worth the watch and you'll get a couple of chills and scares even when you know whats coming.

		<fullReview>This movie focuses on a television reporter (Carpenter) and her cameraman (Harris) as they shoot a normal day in the life of a fireman, which leads them to an apartment complex where they are locked inside with what appear to be zombie like creatures. The movie is shot from the view point of the cameraman (similar to the Blair Witch Project) which can often leave the viewer a little dizzy. This movie started off slow, however once the zombie like creatures started to show, the movie became a lot more entertaining. I have seen some really good zombie films, and a lot of terrible ones, I would say this one was one of the better ones. We watched this at 12 at night with all the lights off and it made the film a lot more enjoyable. If you are going to watch this I recommend you do the same to get the most out of it!

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was intrigued. I should first of all say that I was never a horror film fan before I came to University. Since University I have watched a number of them! None of them, as of yet, have really convinced me.I should also warn you all that I have just watched the film, and have drunk quite a lot of beer during the duration of it...any sentences that don't make sense and spelling/grammar errors are due to the beer! I actually quite enjoyed the film, rather, I enjoyed the concept of it. I wrote a similar review for the film "Catacoombs". My problem was that is it really original? A disease which spreads rapidly causing destruction and unrest, Stephen King's novel "The Stand" springs to mind first, and I'm sure with a bit of thought I could think of more.The film didn't move that fast to start with, at first I thought my friends had rented the wrong film, a documentary about firemen, I was up for a horror! They set the scene quickly but failed to get the film moving, I got the idea, I liked the idea, but irritatingly they kept filming the fire station! Anyway, they moved on. From then I thought there was a slight aspect of an "idiots plot", whereby the characters in the film are all idiots, I mean, really, after you had established the virus did bad things to people what would you actually do? I understand the reporter wants to further her career by filming the events, but in all honesty, in that situation I'd get myself behind a couple of the firemen with axes (which they don't really use much!) and the policemen with guns (likewise). The whole reason the virus spread was due, more or less, to stupidity, it could have been prevented, ultimately, by sticking together as a group.However, I thought the acting was good from most of the cast, the reporter especially did a good job, the firemen too. I also really liked the idea of the cameraman filming the entire film, that worked really well. There were a few continuity errors (such as the cameraman teleporting in front of the reporter when he was originally behind her), but they exist everywhere in any film.It was entertaining, probably more due to the fact that each of us was cracking jokes at every given opportunity, I wasn't remotely scared, maybe jumped once or twice but it lacked suspense.Overall, enjoyable, but really not convincing as a plot as it was devoid of logic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite an interesting premise, is only middle of the road.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since seeing "An American Werewolf in London", at the age of five, I have been an aficionado of horror films. For years, the genre constantly delivered the cinematic thrills I instantly became addicted to. But the genre has since fallen on hard times, and things have yet to get better. Put simply, there are simply too many J-Horror film remakes, PG-13 fright flicks, torture porn films, and romanticized vampires for the field to be taken seriously anymore. Sadly, despite having promise, "Quarantine" falls into yet another detrimental category?the gimmick.However, I first want to state that this movie isn't all that bad. The acting, all the way from Jennifer Carpenter to Columbus Short, was pretty good. There was no problem on my part in believing their characters were truly on edge and in dire straits. The set design was also tight. If I lived in California and that building actually existed, I wouldn't mind living there?after it was cleaned up. Also, I have to give props for the lighting and sound. What I could see looked damned good and what I could hear sounded even better. But, and I hate to say it, this film is still mediocre.I felt that the pacing was a bit too uneven. "Quarantine" is approximately ninety minutes long. Normally, this running time would be more than long enough to present a full and satisfying tale. But, seeing as how it spends the first fifteen minutes in a fire station, the pacing is far from smooth. Instead of the situation steadily progressing, it rushes to the worse case scenario in too little time to let things develop. One second the story has two or three infected. Then, in a matter of seconds and off camera, the number of infected persons spirals out of control. Before I had time to adjust to the change in status quo, everyone was running for their lives, and I was left feeling out of the loop. A more gradual shift would've been easier to follow.Also, at several points during "Quarantine", logic just seemed to jump out the window. For one, where were the guns? There were two police officers with sidearms. Later there were two CDC agents with rifles. This counts for four firearms. Yet, only one of the infected was shot. Too me, that made no sense. In one scene, there is an infected person on the other side of a glass door. One character states that the door won't hold. The same character then proceeds to stand right in front of the glass so the infected can reach through and kill him. It was established that this carnage was all due to a contagious pathogen. Then Carpenter's character insists on taking off her jacket and running around in a wife beater? Lastly, a woman is carrying around her sick daughter for what seems like forever. Then, without any warning or change in her condition, the tyke goes evil, attacks her mom, and runs off? But, for me, what really hampers "Quarantine" is it's standing as a gimmick film. From beginning to end, everything is seen from the POV of a hand-held camera. Whatever the camera doesn't see or hear, doesn't really exist?problem. Imagine if "Jaws" had been seen entirely from Chief Brody's POV. We wouldn't have witnessed the opening scene which made the film. We'd never have seen poor Alex Kittner get dragged under the waves in horrific fashion. In "Quarantine", however, this singular focus resulted in me not being able to better understand what the hell was going on. It would've been nice to see more background on this Doomsday Cult. Who were they? Based off the sounds on that tape recorder, what were they? On the flip side, I also never really got to feel anything for the residents of this doomed building, because I wasn't allowed to know who they were or where they were coming from.Dania Ramirez's character gets infected?BFD. A lawyer gets shredded by an infected dog?so what. The lady with the infected daughter is left handcuffed to a staircase where she is attacked?whoop de friggin' do. With them being little more than luggage for the narrative to carry, why should I care about any of them? Normally, in a less claustrophobic movie, this wouldn't matter (case in point "AVP 2"). But, when the environment is so heavily confined and the cast rather small, it sticks out. In other words, it's one thing if I don't care about the majority of a cast. But if I'm not given enough info to care about one character from a cast of twelve, that's something else altogether. And repeated viewings, once the one-time thrill of the gimmick had run its course, didn't answer my questions. If anything, watching this twice only made it more obvious how thin this movie was.Still, "Quarantine" is worth a rental for being a hard R horror flick, with decent production values. I was going to give this a seven for being fun, but having some nagging issues. Sadly, seeing as how it's a remake of a recent foreign film, I have to lower it a point. Hopefully, if they do another horror film, the Dowdle Bros. will abandon the gimmicks of this and the "Poughkeepise Tapes" to focus on crafting an original and more satisfying story. With any luck, maybe it will be the next great sea monster or werewolf flick?because God knows they don't make those anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh no - it's one of them shaky-cam films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like Cloverfield, Diary of the dead, Blair Witch, Cannibal Holocaust and The Planet's Funniest Animals, this is one of those films consisting entirely of footage shot by one of the characters. Thankfully, this one isn't so headache-inducing, in a visual sense at least, although I did find myself grinding my teeth at all the screaming towards the end.What you've got here is a bunch of people sealed in a building where a virus is spreading amongst the tenants. In addition to this you have a couple of policemen, firemen, and an annoyingly insincere reporter with her trusty cameraman by her side. Unable to escape, the cameraman documents the various panic attacks and screaming fits the characters have.It sounds like I'm bashing the film, but I'm not. Despite the 'shakey-cam' angle, and the usual 'characters all screaming at each other' stuff we usually get, Quarantine manages to fit in rather a lot of tense sequences as the tenants try and survive against the odds. About halfway through the film things pick up and the films shifts into high gear right until the end.Perhaps not an incredibly deep or resonant horror film, but you could do a lot worse.Similar title: Mulberry Street - worth tracking down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much better spin on the hand held "all real" Horror Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see Quarantine from the moment I saw the trailers. I mean I watch almost anything but I love horror and I love films that focus the tension on isolation and Quarantine definitely does that. The story is not really character driven but rather driven by the story and the mystery of what is happening. The decision to film it using the hand held camera technique that other films have used actually worked really well for the film. Previously Cloverfield used this method to decent success and classic Horror like the original Blair Witch film really honed the technique. The key is that it has to really feed the atmosphere and actually make sense to the story and Quarantine has all of that going for it. Unlike Cloverfield the camera is kept relatively steady and clear so it isn't disorientating. Apparently I feel pretty strongly about Asian/European horror films being made into English...but in a positive way. I love The Ring and it's sequel, and The Grudge was solid. Quarantine is part zombie flick, part horror blood bath, part isolated thriller but anyone who likes any of these genre's can't possibly be disappointed with this.Jennifer Carpenter takes the roll of scream queen and does a great job. Sometimes it feels like perhaps she might be over acting but she pulls of terror really disturbingly well. She's a decently strong character and because of the nature of the monster doesn't really get to fight back but she is still a terrific lead character. Steve Harris is her camera man who obviously doesn't get a lot of time in front of the camera that he is in charge of...if any time...but he still plays a decent role with his voice and action and him and Carpenter have decent chemistry which is pretty impressive given they don't show any actual screen time together. The rest of the cast is great, I certainly don't mean to take anything away from anyone but they are all victims plain and straight forward so they get less than five minutes to establish decent characters only to be picked off in horrible ways. There is still some strong actors in these small roles including Jay Hernandez, Johnathon Schaech and Rade Serbedzija (terrific character actor.) No one really stands out unfortunately because this is all about the story.Relative newcomer John Erick Dowdle co-wrote and directed the film. He certainly has a decent eye for horror or thriller and knows how to really get the spirit of the film in motion. The gore is awesome and actually gives you some extremely disturbing images that aren't run of the mill for the horror genre. Considering Quarantine had a very low budget I think they did a truly terrific job at really making it watchable with edge of your seat thrills and a really great story. They could serialize it and might considering the reasonable success of the film but I don't think it would be a good idea as much as I love sequels. One thing is for sure I definitely am looking forward to seeing the Spanish original film .REC Certainly worth checking out!! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the scariest movie I've seen in a long time! It's the first movie I've been compelled to comment on (I created my IMDb profile to comment on THIS movie). I just watched it on DVD at home, I drenched myself with lukewarm coffee, my heart rate is still up, and I'm looking at my dog sideways.I was planning to veg out with a typical B horror flick, and I was pleasantly surprised that it was immediately entertaining and well written. The movie starts with a reporter and her cameraman shadowing a crew of firemen, and the beginning scene is witty and fun ... until, of course, the call to action.The premise of a mutated rabies virus IS more believable than dead-reanimated zombies, but there are inevitable (even glaring) gaps in the logic. Suspend the disbelief, ignore the gaps, and enjoy the scare ... pause the video before taking a drink or else use a sippy-cup!This film is absolutely terrifying! I really want to see REC because one of the main criticisms of this movie is that it's an inferior remake of REC.</fullReview>

Now that's out of the way lets get on with the film review. Back in the 90's I was a big fan of the Blair Witch, then recently I became a fan of Cloverfield but as of two nights ago I'm now a huge, huge fan of Quarantine, this movie along with the special effects, editing and outright brilliant setting is absolutely amazing, if you love horror films then go and watch this movie because I'm giving it a ten out ten for making me jump a great number of over fifteen plus times out of my seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair Remake but Stick with the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine (2008) ** (out of 4) I'm one who thinks remakes aren't always a bad thing but ever so often you get one that's scene for scene, which is pretty much what this thing here turned out to be. This is a remake of the Spanish film REC from one year earlier and that's certainly the film people should check out. As in the original, a female reporter (Jennifer Carpenter) and her cameraman are hanging out and shooting a documentary with a fire crew when they are called to an apartment. What appears to be your average call turns into a nightmare as everyone gets locked inside as some virus is causing the residents to turn into creatures. This film actually has a lot in common with the remakes of PSYCHO and THE OMEN and that's the rare case where the new version does very little to change anything from the first film. This American remake features the exact same set up, the exact build up and the exact same ending and you really have to ask yourself what the point was. There's a key element to what's going on that's left out here but that doesn't hurt or help the film any more. This thing comes off as a major disappointment considering how great the original film was but it's unfair to judge the two together so I'll just focus on this film. This time out I had a major problem getting involved in the film because not once did I feel any part of the action. Not once did I feel I was trapped inside this apartment complex and this is a major problem. Another problem is that there wasn't an ounce of suspense but this here could be due to me watching this less than 24-hours after viewing the original film. This is a remake where it seems like the filmmakers studied the original for hours and then tried to copy what they watched but in the end the movie feels watered down, weak and just all around tame. There's not a single second in this movie that can compare to the original so I don't see the point of this film. Is it a bad movie? No, it's decent in its own right but there's just not a point to it. I think they could have mixed things up a lot better but in the end it just comes off as rather lazy and uninspired.</fullReview>

It's "lazy film making" and does huge injustice to everyone involved in the film. All it says is that the director lacks the technical skills to frame a picture or is too cheap and lazy to hire a real cinematographer. Not only that but a real news cameraman can hold a camera steady ... the artificial shakiness is stupid and provokes vomiting.Aside from that it is a fun B-movie, if you can take the queasiness brought on by the dumb camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie 10 minutes before, and I have to say, I expected much more... After a first 30 minutes, I was in temptation to leave from cinema. But after that, it becomes a little bit interesting.As we all know, it is about disease, theme that is used in so much movies, but I give it a try because it is, as I like to call it, a "first person movie." One camera and action. Nevertheless, I can say anything bad about acting, it is decent. There where some few shines from Jenniefer Carpenter telling us that might be something out of her in future. But comparing it to Manuela Velasco (from original), she can't do a thing.This is the first time that I heard for John E. Dowdle. I give him the thumbs up because he tried to make some first person horror/mystery film, but in a bad way. I don't have to say that he tried to do the remake of Spanish REC, and failed. When will the people learn not to do remakes? Only 2 from 10 remakes are worth watching, and 1-2 fantastic.In the end, all I can say is that I maybe expected to much. Sure, you can't expect something brilliant out of movie, but comparing it to original, it sucks... a lot.. If you did not watch REC, give it 2 stars up. If you did, then you know why this review is written like this...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"28 Days Later" meets "The Blair Witch Project" meets "Cloverfield",... with so-so results.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>QUARANTINE, the remake of Spanish film REC, is one of the latest entries in the horror genre. The plot is quite simple: what begins as a night of footage gathering for a young reporter and her cameraman, going along for the ride with some firemen to a reported emergency at an L.A. apartment building, quickly turns into a hair-raising nightmare. This, because something VERY wrong has happened inside...I cannot say anymore without going into spoiler-hood; however, be warned. This is basically a rehash of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, 28 DAYS LATER and CLOVERFIELD; and the results, while nothing groundbreaking, aren't that bad either -if you can tolerate the extremely shaky hand-held camera without going sick-. The performances are, at the most, serviceable, with Jennifer Carpenter and Jay Hernandez (as a doomed fireman) standing out. Steve Harris is the cameraman, but we mostly hear him rather than seeing him, since he is filming -there are only a couple of really quick shots of him throughout the movie-.I haven't seen the original Spanish film from which they made the remake to establish parameters, but I can say this version delivers the goods satisfactorily; and particularly, the last 10 minutes of the film will have you literally at the edge of your seat.Give yourself a chance and watch it, if you tolerate a good little horror flick with some shaky shots. You might like it; I know I did -somehow-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 21st-century generation of horror where kids today are used to the likes of "Saw" and "Hostel," it seems nice to finally see a film like "Quarantine," a horror movie that for the most part eschews mindless blood and gore and instead focuses on scaring the living daylights out of you. (I am, however, guilty of having a weakness for the "Saw" films, and I do intend on seeing "Saw V" next week.) In today's times, that's a rare feat, and "Quarantine" succeeds despite a few missteps along the way. And for this upcoming Halloween season, I felt I needed a good scare, and, boy, I got it.I've never seen the original Spanish film "Rec" from which "Quarantine" is based, but I can say that the filmmakers - chiefly director John Erick Dowdle and his brother/co-screenwriter Drew - have crafted a creepy and effectively terrifying horror/thriller that is able to remind genre fans that Hollywood still has a little bit of what it takes to genuinely frighten us.Like its Spanish source material "Rec" and using the reality-style documentary techniques of "The Blair Witch Project" (1999) and "Cloverfield" (2008) that have become so popular lately, "Quarantine" follows Los Angeles news reporter Angela Vidal (a surprising Jennifer Carpenter) and her cameraman Scott (Steve Harris) as they shadow a fire engine truck on its nightly rounds across the city. Things are pretty slow and uninteresting, but we get to know Angela and Scott and their primary subjects, firemen Jake (Jay Hernandez) and Fletcher (Johnathan Schaech).While on their nightly rounds, Jake's fire truck receives the first call to respond to an incident involving an old woman locked in her apartment in a downtown apartment complex. The police are also on the scene to aid the firemen and get to the bottom of what's going on. Many of the residents are huddled into the building's main lobby. On the third floor, they locate the apartment in question, and its sole inhabitant, and they break down the door, not knowing that doing so would be like unlocking a Pandora's Box of unrelenting terror. What's even more alarming is, why has the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) showed up to seal off the building, and why are the police and military threatening to kill anyone who attempts to escape? So Angela, Scott, Jake, and the residents of the building have to try to survive the night in an inescapable building with an unspeakable terror...This is a pretty effective horror/thriller we have here. I'm not lying. "Quarantine" is the first horror film since "The Descent" (2005) - one of the very best horror/thrillers of the new millennium so far, and one of my personal favorite horror films of all time - to truly frighten me in ways I didn't think were any longer possible. But "Quarantine" is by no means perfect. There are a number of times when characters have opportunities to try to survive longer, but ignore them, and I found myself saying in my mind, "You better take a better look around!" or something along those lines. And then of course, as with all reality-style documentary films of late, problems can be found with the first-person camera-work. For those of you who suffer from motion sickness (I don't), the frantic and disorientating camera-work can be a bit of a distraction and kill the mood and your overall enjoyment of the picture.However, there are many other pluses. First is Jennifer Carpenter. It's amazing the transformation she goes through, from first being a clear-headed and bright newswoman to a scream-queen who eventually succumbs to the unrelenting terror of the situation. It's a performance I found to be truly skillful, especially in the later scenes, even though I do question her judgment in some of the later horror sequences. But what I did like is the fact that even when she's screaming her head off, she remains a three-dimensional character, and that's an aspect of her performance that I found to be truly admirable, especially for this sort of movie. (Is she the future of Hollywood/"B"-movie scream-queens?) The biggest surprise, though, has to go to the direction of John Erick Dowdle. Despite any grievances, he is able to structure "Quarantine" with a mounting sense of fear and dread from the get-go, and skillfully maintains it throughout the entire picture. It's these same unbearable levels of fear and dread - and later, pure pitch-black darkness (in one particularly frightening sequence that reminded me of a similar scene from "Aliens") - that keep you on the edge on your seat, and knowing that nobody is going to make it out of this movie alive. And it is for this reason that I gave "Quarantine" the rating that I gave it.That, my friends, is what horror is - sometimes - really about.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting premise turns into run-of-the-mill horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The set-up is interesting. A news crew follows the night-shift of a fire department. They get a call to an apartment complex &amp; things go bad pretty quickly. The horror that ensues is much less interesting.There are a few good spook moments. However, most of the attempted "scares" just aren't that scary. It may be that I've seen many horror movies &amp; I'm just not scared easily, but many movies have done the scares better than this one. Also, the use of a hand-held camera has been done before with better effect (i.e. Cloverfield). There were a few of those moments where you go, "Duh, why would they do that?", which just take away from the terror &amp; make you laugh instead. The reveal of what has caused this disaster is not very original or shocking. You know the fate of all the characters as soon as they are "quarantined" in the building.The acting is adequate, as they portray a sense of dread &amp; panic pretty well, especially the lead actress in the later parts of the film. There were a surprising number of recognizable actors for what seems like a pretty low-budget film. But they can't carry this movie beyond average horror.You could simplify Quarantine down to the trapped, dark, claustrophobic feeling of The Descent with the flesh-hunting, infection-spreading zombies of 28 Days Later, but not nearly as good as either movie.</fullReview>

Of course after sitting through it I realized that the reality of this movie is so real it can scare anybody if caught in the same situation. During the whole time I was getting more and more scared because it seemed so real. I didn't expect it to end the way it did.Without giving anything away I think their's a lot of unanswered questions which could call for a sequel. It's hard to say if there will be one or not.If you want to see a great horror movie for Halloween i think Quarantine is your best bet other than Saw 5.</fullReview>

Jennifer Carpenter is excellent...actually a nice breath of fresh air throughout the movie. The other actors are all average. Other reviewers complained about the shaky camera but it really is not as bad as others make it out to be. You always know what is going on, and while the cause of what is happening is never said out right you get a good enough sense of what happened. So I would say that this is a good movie to go see if you like horror /suspense, or if you just want to see a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Happy Halloween folks.</fullReview>

Quarantine is absolutely brilliant, scary entertainment. I found the acting was very good with convincing behaviour and dialogue. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie once the action kicked off. Very tense and actually quite exhausting to watch. There are some real goose-bump inducing scenes and I really can't see how any horror fan would think otherwise.The last time I felt this impressed by a horror movie was when I watched the remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' in the cinema almost empty of people.If you haven't seen it and are wondering what to do about that then please, disregard the pointless 'worst movie ever' reviews and WATCH THIS FANTASTIC HORROR MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, it's cheap to just copy a movie shot-by-shot.But hey, how many American movies/TV shows/songs/*insert random cultural item here* got ripped off in other countries. I mean, seriously, "Rec" itself was just Blair Witch meets Dawn of the Dead. So all the fancy pantsy art-house film lovers who think Hollywood kills culture and cite "Rec" - of all things - are probably just misinformed.It might be a matter of personal taste (and isn't art always), but I thought the acting in "Quarantine" was way better than in "Rec". Especially Jennifer Carpenter. I have rarely seen somebody freak out that credibly. On the downside, half of the cast is of minor TV fame, which made me go "Hey, isn't that the guy/gal from ..." all the time.The special effects were also done a bit more professional and I thought the directing was a bit more subtle. Some genre-typical scenes that put me off in "Rec" were more subdued or slightly altered here.To sum it up: 8/10.PS: Thank you Hollywood! I live in Germany and our Movies suck. If it weren't for you ... well, I'd probably have hobbies and appreciate nature more. Still, thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling insignificance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the sake of avoiding repeating myself I'm simply going to discuss the changes and new elements of Quarantine that differ from those of the original. Seeing as the movie is essentially a direct copy of REC I advise -if you want a review of the basic structure and form of the film- that you read my original article.Anyone who has seen Gus Van Sant's now infamous remake of classic movie Psycho should be able to grasp the basic premise of this review. Quarantine, which is essentially a carbon copy remake of this year's suspense laden REC, just about pulls out most of the tricks that the filmmakers of the original did half a year ago, but at the expense of any compelling degree of originality. Of course, to anyone who hasn't seen Hitchcock's Psycho, Van Sant's would be a nice treat; that is, essentially, the aim of what those remaking movies try to do. While covering an already established feature shot by shot for the sake of bringing it to a modern audience doesn't necessarily make for a negative experience, it certainly makes for a less interesting and significant one than seeing it the first time round. This is where the job of reviewing such movies becomes perplexing; Quarantine in most regards is every bit as strong as the source material that it bases itself upon, but the changes that are made only detract further, and when used with scenes that are lifted directly from something I seen only six months ago, the result is naturally unsatisfying.Following the same basic premise as its source, Quarantine tells the story of an amateur news reporter and her camera man as they are locked inside a building where people are going crazy and eating other residents. The story is for the most part identical, save for a few minor details and shift in focus. Of course this is a good thing; REC had an interesting and intriguing premise that always kept the viewer guessing whilst on the edge of their seat. Quarantine is more or less the same. The biggest and most notable exception to this however lies in the pacing of John Erick Dowdle's version, which, at an excessive twenty minutes longer than REC, moves at a much slower rate. One of the original movie's biggest flaws was that while it was only seventy minutes long, there wasn't enough plotting to sustain interest all the way through; particularly in the middle act. Adding twenty minutes onto this version only makes matters worse; the experience is less frantic as a result and as such neglects much of the film's later construction of past paced momentum to that of middling tedium.Characterisation is also notably out of focus; the basic exposition material of the first act remains the same and characters are still given brief snapshots of profiling here and there, but the focus and pacing on these elements is lacking. Of course the original feature didn't have many character moments either, but they were enough to deliver the movie's main selling point of pure horror; Quarantine is less concerned with atmosphere and more about things jumping out into the camera. There are some nice results of this shift which helps make the movie feel distant from its brother, but more often than not, this change in dynamic only hurts the tense atmosphere that made for a terrifying experience six months back. The performances are much more consistent and work every bit as well ?if not better- than those found in the original with Jennifer Carpenter filling in her screaming damsel character with the required conviction to carry the movie forwards.So how can I recommend a copy of another movie when I could simply advise you to watch the first version, which although only marginally superior, nevertheless gets the job done with more ferocity and imagination? The answer is that I cannot, no matter how good Quarantine is. Instead, unless you take allergic reactions to subtitles, I can only recommend that you save your money for a DVD version of REC instead; the differences are subtle but for all intents and purposes make the remake disposable in comparison. If however you have already seen the original then there is absolutely no reason for you to catch this. A carbon copy with only minute changes, Quarintine is a fine example of horror and does its job amply in comparison with its source material, but refusing to do much outside of changing the performers and their language, the movie boils down to one of compelling insignificance.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Realistic and decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually really enjoyed this film, because of the way it was filmed, like a home video, it gave a sense of realism, also the fact that it was done this way sort of involved us more and we got a sense of the panic that the characters were going through, and also how the camera being there affected the characters within the film. And I thought it was quite good how the different characters reacted differently to different things and changed as they became threatened, and it was believable that people would react that way, which just made the whole film good.I haven't seen (REC) so I can't say weather or not this was a good remake or not, but I do know that is was a good film that had very good acting in it and also I thought that the ending was very realistic, and also the way the incident was portrayed on the media (within the film).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK not only was this a bad movie with crappy shaky film quality that made me sick to my stomach but everyone in it was a moron. Every character in the movie handled the situations in the worst possible way to the point of irritating me and my two buddies enough to make us yell at the screen. Every person was yelling at each other and fighting like idiots and always leaving their backs exposed to dark wide open hallways. When there are rabid people who are clearly infectious, you keep your eyes and ears open you don't leave yourself completely exposed. The female main character went from cute and funny to an intolerable nuisance who screamed when she should have been running and cried when she should have been fighting for her life. This was an absolutely garbage movie, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>high octane movie with little description of why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're into high action zombie movies, this one is for you. As a fan of horror movies, I usually laugh at the stupidity of many of the characters. This movie, however, was the first in a long time to actually scare me.One aspect that was most interesting about the movie was its first person point of view. It can be shaky at times, but offers a more personal fear factor. Each character has their own personality, and each becomes effected in a big way by the mysterious sickness. The characters are all left with little to no idea about what reasons could possibly bekeeping them inside, another aspect that heightens the insecurity of a viewer. Overall, this movie was an hour and a half of non-stop action and zombie insanity. It invokes fear, sadness, discomfort, and mounds of confusion. "Quarantine" will leave you on the edge of your seats for the entire hour and a half and will make sure you check your back as well as every corner for zombies on your travels back to the hypothetical comfort of your own home</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i just came from watching this movie, as the original, REC is as yet unavailable. it kicks butt!!! good pacing, once the movie was over, i couldn't help but wonder if some of them could've been let out if only those yahoos inside would've just kept calm and stayed still. You wonder if it was just a situation that got outta control. Everything seemed okay, that is until people started separating into their own rooms to barricade themselves from the infection. Basically, a vet in the building is a member of a doomsday cult, and is developing a supervirus--rabies on steroids. A little girl's dog gets infected, and her daddy takes it to an animal hospital. the dog kills every animal around, and it's all traced back to the complex. by then, humans have been infected, possibly by coming in contact with the little girl. I don't need to tell u what happens next, but it has some of the most craziest stuff I have ever seen!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never seen the original, which is a good thing, so now my preview CANNOT be biased, nor can i base my review based on the old one.But i thought this movie was AWESOME...it starts out being VERY funny and realistic....etc.Then it picks up alittle bit....then it slows down....and keeps following those lines.Eventually it hits full throttle and gets Insane/Freaky.This movie really freaked me out, the way the zombies/infected looked! By far THE SCARIEST i want to say! It was just SO REAL!Like you see typical zombies, and they just have a predictable way about them after seeing so many zombie movies.But the zombies in this movie are just Foaming and drooling all over themselves and are in a complete Trance until someone touches them or gets near them.If you imagine a zombie plague ACTUALLY happening...THIS would be the closest possibility to the real thing!!!The acting was EXCELLENT.....usually with these types of movies, i see some good believable acting, then it gets Super Fake all of a sudden...and so forth. But this movie, it was just SOLID documentary style. This kind of acting and camera work TOTALLY DESTROYED diary of the dead and Blair Witch and anything in that category. It was just completely believable.A lot of people mention the camera and darkness...... Personally i thought the camera was fairly steady until near the 3rd quarter of the movie when things got nuts.But you HAVE to expect this kind of camera work, since its CLEARLY a documentary/news type film!!!! (thats like going to a football game and complaining that people are drunk, loud and obnoxious!)Again, I've seen a lot of first person documentary style movies, and this one WAS NOT super shaky or anywhere near unbearable! The camera Doesn't have super jerky movements like blair witch and cloverfield. Its actually done PERFECT in this movie, gotta give them credit.The ONLY thing I didn't like about this movie was the ending! The ending was Definitely freaky and scary as hell.....but i just wanted to pick up my computer and throw it across the room after how the movie just ends so abruptly and unexpected. I like unexpected things and endings...but the movie seemed so solid and smooth for a 1st person zombie thriller, then it just BAM ends....but not as stupid as Cloverfield ends.Other than that, the movie was VERY realistic, and FREAKY and CREEPY...and suddenly an Adrenaline Rush!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK I have to say that this movie is really horrible. First of all, the cameraman in this movie is horrible at his job. He can't even focus on the situation as a professional.. and why is he always zoomed in so close? His lack of camera operating skills drove me sick and it made the movie UNBEARABLE. He is by far a professional.. Second of all, I can't stand the high level of stupidity in this movie. If you see a little girl rip a chunk of meat off her mother's face, why would you even go close to her saying that you would help her? Not only that, HOLD HER!?!? Did the characters NOT learn from what happened with the old lady that bit the first cop and blood was gushing out of his neck? I'm sorry that's just really stupid.. You see the very same symptoms of the victims, why can't they put two and two together!?!? Obviously these people don't watch enough television. They are very similar to ZOMBIES. You see a guy split open his shin from a terrible high fall get up from his cot and walking on his own with no problem, isn't that a bit creepy??? But instead they just grabbed him and put him back on the cot.. wow... If I see that, I wouldn't even go near him... and I would grab any weapon I can find. These people trapped in the building didn't even grab anything. They just run around like they got their heads cut off and scream and act like fools/idiots. Another thing. I really am VERY tired of seeing zombie movies where cops or whoever have guns shoot the body instead of the head... SHOOT THE HEAD!!!!!!!! Especially cops with experience with guns! That just kills me! The female news lady (main character) annoys me.. All she does is cry, whine, act like a moron, and freak out. Her personality irritates me! She acts like a ditz as well.. If you see someone kill a zombie in an apartment, why would you just STAND THERE AND STAY THERE!?!? Her crying and screaming is the most unbearable part of the movie. I'm sorry but this movie was a waste of money and time! Don't bother seeing it. Wait for it on DVD for rental. Don't even bother buying the movie. Cloverfield is the best movie yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quarantine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, now I'm glad I did wait to watch this movie after REC. I was startled, to tell you the truth, how practically identical they were. A few minor changes(such as the root cause for the outbreak, the use of the camera to bludgeon the face of a zombie in, a dog attacking a drunk lawyer in an elevator), but such potent scenes as the infected rabid child tearing into her mother and a cop's throat, the fireman thrown from the third floor landing with a loud thud to the floor below, the sudden escalation of infected humans moving quickly up stairs after prey, the infected dog a major carrier of the rabies-like disease(..as told to us by a veterinarian in the building), the trouble reporter Jennifer Carpenter and her cameraman Steve Harris have with cop Columbus Short and others trying to keep them from shooting what is transpiring, the tempers flaring, accusations pointed towards certain parties out of angst, anxieties and exhaustion causing bouts of bickering(..including the drawing of a gun among other actions spurned out of fear and anger), horrified reactions at how the government, military, and police have isolated them(..cutting off all methods of communication, turning off the power and cable to the apartment building, a marksman shooting a tenant attempting to flee the building, the bitten mother handcuffed to the stairwell(..soon a ghoul herself, reaching out for our heroes as they attempt to walk past her) and the finale once the cameraman's light has been destroyed with him having to switch to night vision(..having to guide a helpless Carpenter around while a ghoul searches for them with a hammer). Like in the original, Carpenter is following a group of firemen as they enter an apartment, not knowing she may never get out alive. Like in the original, Carpenter and Harris shoot as much footage as they can, even when told not to. Bottom line is that "Quarantine", if it were an original horror film, would probably be a celebrated achievement..but, it is based almost entirely on a Spanish horror modern classic, and that effects it's standing with many fans, including me. Jay Hernandez(Hostel)is the heroic firefighter who attempts to help Short restore, and keep, order and calm, unable to do so when all hell breaks loose, and the zombie outbreak spreads like a wild fire that can not be contained. Johnathon Schaech(Prom Night; The Forsaken)is the unfortunate firefighter thrown several stories, his body broken, as he was bitten by the infected woman they received the call about. A word of warning, if you thought the camera-work in "The Blair Witch Project" was nausea-inducing, just sit through "Quarantine". Not without it's frightening and intense moments, but the final shot of the movie was positively ruined by those marketing advertisers who rob the viewer of punch it would've packed. That wallop it could've had really infuriates me because I was waiting for it, not shocked by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling, scary, and gruesome... no matter what language it's in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've stumbled across a lot of backlash against this film, and most of it is centered around the notion that Quarantine is a "rip-off" of a Spanish film called REC. One IMDb user admitted that they only watched part of Quarantine, but they still branded it with a one-star rating, citing the idea I've just stated as sufficient proof that this film is somehow worthless.So, is Quarantine a rip-off of REC? I can't tell you that, because I haven't seen REC. What I can tell you is that it is now common practice for American studios to purchase the rights to foreign films and make English language versions of them for Western audiences. Surely, even the most casual film-goer should be well aware of this, and horror fans in particular should be intimately familiar with the trend if they've seen any genre offerings made in the last decade. The Ring: remake. The Grudge: remake. Cloverfield: remake. And so on and so on.Arguing that Quarantine shouldn't have been made, because all someone has to do to see it is watch REC and spend the entire film reading subtitles, is ignoring the fact that American mass audiences don't enjoy trying to read and watch a movie at the same time. We could spend all day debating what this says about American film-goers, especially considering that our home-grown films are routinely subtitled and enjoyed by audiences around the world. I'm not particularly interested in what this indicates about our culture; I'm just here to write about a killer horror flick. The fact that most Americans will not see a film with subtitles is unavoidable, and it's the reason films like REC get remade, and it's also the reason why most of the people reading this have never heard of any of the films nominated for the "Best Foreign Language Film" Oscar each year.Personally, I'm glad that when watching Quarantine, I was able to focus on the terrifying images in the camera frame, instead of hurriedly trying to keep up with often-tiny text on the bottom of the screen to figure out what our heroine is screaming as she frantically scrambles up the stairs with a rampaging infected creature in tow. The POV format used here is the perfect presentation to allow us to be completely ensconced in the horror, and continuously having to shift our focus to read dialogue would disrupt that immersion, and ultimately dilute the experience this film provides. If that opinion makes me ignorant, I'm willing to accept that. But my perceived ignorance doesn't strip away the powerful gut-punch Quarantine delivers for most of its 85 minutes.The scenario here is realistic and horrifying, and the fact that a Spanish film-maker already told this story doesn't change the fact that I jumped several times during Quarantine and found myself engrossed in the the film the entire way. This is a truly scary and intense ride, and dismissing it because it previously existed in another incarnation is akin to chastising a stage production of Faust because the dialogue is translated into English. Hell, the Bible wasn't originally written in English, but I don't hear too many Christians espousing the idea that the original text was better and the modern translations used today are "rip-offs". (No, I'm not honestly comparing this film to the Bible... I'd much rather watch Quarantine than read the Bible any day). Even if American film-makers decided to take a brilliant film like Audition and recreate it for Western audiences, I wouldn't view that as blasphemy. I would just be excited that people who would otherwise never see Audition would have the opportunity to have such a twisted and original movie experience. Remakes of this ilk aren't "rip-offs", they're actually an acknowledgment that a concept is so strong that a savvy film-maker wanted that concept to be available to as large an audience as possible.It's best you don't know everything that takes place within the doomed apartment building that houses the titular Quarantine, so I won't spoil the goodness for you. But I can tell you that this film delivers many quality scares, and there is also an abundance of deliciously gruesome bits to satisfy those who enjoy the wetter side of things. Additionally, those who find themselves queasy during POV horror presentations should find the standard film-stock and often-stable camera work here a lot more palatable than the grainy, constantly-moving approach used by many of the offerings in this sub-genre.I don't know if REC is a better movie than this, but since Quarantine is such a treat, I intend to see it and find out. Ultimately, stripped of any comparisons or dismissals, this is very simply an awesome horror film. That's more than good enough for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the best horror films I've seen in a long long time! It is a very cool movie that will hook you,after a bit of a slow start,and will keep you hooked all the way to the very end.A film crew in Los Angeles spends the night in a firehouse to do a story on the firemen who work there.The first several minutes of the film are spent showing the crew setting up shots and all that and I began to think this film was gonna be a clunker.Then all of a sudden the fire station gets a call to go to an apartment building where an old lady is reported to be sick in her apartment.When they arrive and get into her they find she is sick but it's a sickness that they've not seen before she is acting weird and covered in blood.Not long after tons of police and other agents arrive at the apartment building and start sealing it off trapping all the tenants and the firemen and the film crew inside.One by one the people inside the building acquire some sort of illness that turns them into crazy wild killers who attack anything in sight.Soon the electricity and all forms of communication is cut off from the building and the rest of the film is lit with the light from the camera as the survivors race around in the building to try and stay one step ahead of the attacking crazies.While the gore isn't what this film is really about, what gore is here is very well done.Some very cool stunts are also done.This is a taut very cool film.And the last few minutes shot with night vision in the attic of the building is as creepy as anything I've seen in a horror film!That 'thing' puttering around in the attic scared this veteran horror film watcher pretty damn good!And I love it when that happens! This film is worth seeing for the last 15 minutes alone.This one is good enough to buy and watch again.And the DVD extras were also interesting.It's a film like this that makes all those trips to the rental store completely worth it even if you strike out 99% of the time because this film is that 1% that will make you want to go rent again next weekend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I decided to see this remake of "REC" because we'd seen the trailer and it looked pretty damn scary. It was a strange sensation watching this at the theater. All sorts of horrifying and - I suppose --scary insanity ensuing on the screen, as people are locked into a dark apartment building and are overrun by rabies-infected residents who bite and spread the infection. I kept thinking to myself "I guess this WOULD be very good and quite scary, had I not seen this same type of thing a zillion times before...!!". So, it was just okay. I think if I hadn't seen so many hand-held camcorder horror films already, if I hadn't seen rabies-infected maniacs movies, if I hadn't seen any of the George Romero flicks or perhaps 28 DAYS and WEEKS LATER, or the 2004 DAWN OF THE DEAD.... then I would have been impressed. This is a horror film I could see a fresh 16-year-old being really shocked by. But for this old timer, it was just another day at the movies. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a remake based on the Spanish movie, REC. I have seen both of them. Quarantine is quite alike the original and I was bored watching the remake. The director used the "shaking the camera" and it annoyed me sometimes when I was watching it. I don't even know why the trailers bothered to show the ending. I am afraid that this is not original and it will not work unlike Cloverfield. Cloverfield has a more intense storyline. But to be fair, I will not compare this with Cloverfield.The story: It is almost the same as REC so I don't know why people even bother to watch the remake. Those who don't like subtitles or those who want to see the movie with different actors and actresses. The story is dead simple. It is about a team of people surviving in a quarantined area. The acting is pretty realistic. There are also annoying characters as usual. I watch it to compare with the original which people will do. I can't say which is better. The original or the remake. They almost got the storyline and have great plus annoying acting. But I would recommend the original if you like original movies.Overall: It is not bad, there are intense scenes. But if you have watched the original, you may feel that this is predictable and therefore find this boring. If you are a great fan of remakes, you might want to check this out.</fullReview>

Then problems happen when the fire department is sent to a 911 call at a apartment building. They soon become trapped in the building when the building becomes quarantined. I found the movie to be good. But I will say the movie is in no way scary. IF you are not a fan of movies like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield then this is not the movie for you. The movie is not a zombie movie. The people are infected with some kind of virus. Some of the cast in the movie include Jennifer Carpenter, Jay Hernandez, Columbus Short, Rade Serbedzija, and Greg Germann.</fullReview>

The cast were good, especially the leading lady. There are a few extra scenes in this film which were not in the original (REC) and they added to the plot/horror of the movie.I gave this a 6 because although it is a good movie, it is by no means a classic. The camera work ruined it a bit for me too.I would recommend waiting for the DVD release before watching as it's not one that i would want to watch on the big screen.On a side note, people who say that America spoil original movies need to watch this and see that they don't. I believe this to be better than REC but i'm sure you will make your own minds up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into this movie knowing it was an American remake of a Spanish film called "REC." I walked out of the movie stunned and thinking, "Whoa." "Quarantine" is an unsettling film that is filled with what I call "that must suck" situations. For example, there is a scene in the film where a group of four people encounter an infected dog by an elevator. The elevator doors open and a drunk man staggers out, only to find that the dog is coming after him. The man rushes back into the elevator, trying desperately to close the doors before it's too late. Unfortunately for him, it was too late and the dog wound up in the sealed elevator with the man. Before the doors close, however, you can clearly see the canine tearing away at the man's face. You can also hear the sounds of crunching. Now, about the violent content. The movie is not rated R for gore, because it doesn't really need to be. It would only take about a couple more bloody deaths to earn a gore-warning in the rating. Without trying to give too much away, the usual stuff is in the movie. Infected maniacs biting at people's necks while the soon-to-be-infected scream bloody-murder. The editors did a good job adding in gruesome sound effects to go along with the gruesome scenes. However, some of the scary scenes in this film, too me, didn't quite make me jump. There was just something about the scenes that seemed like they were supposed to be scary, but not really. However, as the movie goes on, it gets more scary, gruesome, and suspenseful. The infected people have the characteristics of zombies, but they didn't come back from the dead. One of the victims trapped inside the apartment complex, a veterinarian, said that the infected people showed the same symptoms a rabid person would. However, this infection is kind of like a super-rabies. (Meaning it doesn't take long for the infection to spread.) Also, to go along with rabies, the infected have a knack for viciously killing/infecting others. These are the type that move quick, (run) like the ones in "28 Days Later." Their unearthly shrieks will send shivers down your spine. (Parents-I wouldn't recommend allowing your young children to see this movie. The result may be them crying at the utter fright that's packed into this movie.) The tone of the movie is dark. People quarantined in an apartment complex with God-knows-what scurrying around and gruesomely killing them. The cause for this unknown "outbreak" is even darker.The super of the apartment (before he gets his face ripped to shreds) said that there was a man from Boston renting the penthouse at the top of the apartment which he hadn't seen for months. When the last two survivors make their way up there looking for a way out, they encounter caged infected rats and newspaper clippings on the wall. All of the clippings said something about doomsday and doomsday cults. Also about an "Armaggedon Virus." The camera man finds a tape recorder and plays the tape in it. All you can hear sounds something like satanic chants. (Like those hidden messages when you play a record back words.) So, as the viewer, I believe that you're supposed to assume that the man from Boston was creating a doomsday virus to honor his cult.Oh, and for the record, this movie is like an exact remake of the Spanish film. (Meaning it's a scene-by-scene remake.) If you've seen "REC," in a way you've also scene "Quarantine."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sometimes-Effective Halloween Season Scare Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Quarantine" was a good Halloween-season scare flick. I thought it owed a lot to "Night of the Living Dead" and was very much in keeping with the spate of plague flicks of the past few years, too. I didn't see anything particularly original about it, but it had enough effective moments to keep me interested. The twitchy camera work annoyed me a bit and I sometimes felt like it was being used to cover weak visuals, but I have no way of knowing that; it's just a hunch. There were also a few points in the film at which I thought the characters were acting in ways that real people wouldn't act in a crisis, particularly when the tenants were ordered to stay in close quarters even after the cop and firefighters figured out that they were dealing with a communicable disease. That was such a glaring plot device that it took a little something away from the movie for me.It was an OK flick; nothing special, but better than half of what gets released in the horror genre these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, we have seen it many times, 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil, I am Legend, and Quarantine is no exception!! All about rage people infecting others but we all love them. If Hollywood is exploring this familiar topic over and over again, it means that these movies are well liked because we go to see them.Quarantine is a movie with good acting, scary scenes and a moderate decent plot. The fact that the movie was filmed documentary style makes up for the lack of a better explained plot, or to say it in other words, the documentary style presented in the film justifies the uncertainness of some of the key elements of the plot such as how did the virus originate? who created it? who were the creatures living in the attic? making it more intriguing and creating a greater suspense. Also, remember that not seeing completely who is attacking, or seeing them only partially, on bits in a movie is a great technique to scare people, it really works.I guess some people go to see "pop corn" movies (meaning movies that the sole purpose is to entertain) with a highly intellectual and analytical mind. This wont work with Quarantine. But if you go to watch Quarantine to have a good time, to experience some wonderful scary moments and to experience great horrific gore you will be very happy with this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary remake of Spanish horror hit "Rec".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angela joins firemen Jake and other fire-fighting heroes on a disturbance call to an old apartment building.Tenants were spooked due to an old lady's scream.Upon further investigation the old lady tenant viciously attacks on the of the police officers already on the scene and when the people try to leave the building it appears they've been locked in.Blocked from escape with other infected people around a vet who lives in the building is able to figure out that the disease that's been plaguing the tenants is a new,advanced form of rabies that manifests in humans in minutes and is totally incurable.First of all I loved "Rec"-it was eerie and has some realistic scenes of terror and paranoia."Quarantine" is almost a carbon copy of Spanish horror hit with only a few new things added.That's why it didn't kept me on the edge of my seat.Because I have seen the original I could almost predict everything.Jennifer Carpenter is also more hysterical than Manuela Velasco and the building from "Quarantine" is nowhere near as creepy as that from "Rec".Still if I haven't seen the original before I'd give this film much more positive review.6 out of 10 and that's being kind.</fullReview>

Shades of Romero and Cronenberg underscore the tension of a band of strangers facing an unsuspecting horror still elicits enough bump-in-the-dark moments of sheer unease thanks largely to the meat and potatoes screenplay by John Erick Dowdle (who also directed) and brother Drew (adapting Spanish film "REC") and a "BLAIR WITCH" visceral momentum keeps things at an adrenaline quickening tempo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into Quarantine I didn't know what to expect. I'd read the forums here on IMDb and how everyone thought this was going to be a ripoff of Rec. To get it out there now, I have not seen Rec. And yet I enjoyed this movie quite a lot.The characters generally did what most people would do ( I especially liked the part where the cameraman bashed the woman to death with his camera). The acting was great, especially by the lead character (Jennifer Carpenter). And although there were a lot of questions that were not answered I believe that is how these types of movies are supposed to be. Where would the fun be if all the questions were answered? There were a few thing that bugged me however. Such as where did the CDC soldiers weapons disappear to? They both walked into the building clearly holding assault rifles and yet they didn't use them.All in all Quarantine is a solid movie worth the watch. 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall the film did something a horror movie hasn't done in a long time, it scared the crap out of me. The film's strongest points are that it has very gruesome death sequences and give a feel of terror. For the sake of a good ending though, the deaths seemed to get staler and staler... At one point in the movie, about half the cast dies within 5 minutes of a single scene, topped with some of the characters seemingly vanishing. It was also hard to keep up with who was who at times, at the end of the movie, the "badass" or "hero" gets randomly killed as a zombie just leaps at him and chews his throat out, then the camera man was either beaten or stabbed to death by the Gandhi zombie(the zombie looked like Gandhi.) Then of course the last survivor being the obnoxious news lady, gets pulled into the darkness by an unknown entity. The back story was also very bleak and left you guessing at the end as to what was really going on. But it all falls with a stereotypical plot line, that the government is conspiring with some super biological weapon or they discover some rare strain of a disease(in this case rabies, Kujo much?) The camera angles were also very similar to Cloverfield, in that the entire movie is told from a camera that has seemingly and endless life and is hard to keep on what is going on visually. It was probably done for realism, but still... It's a movie. To top it off, I stayed for the ending credits and almost as if to humor the audience is discloses the film as fictional. (i would certainly hope it was fictional...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Film Of 2008!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your looking for some huge scares, nerve-crackling &amp; non-stop suspense, then Quarantine is the right film for you. For people who haven't seen it and worried about motion sickness, then don't worry this film is not so shaky at all!! So far this year, there haven't been so many scary movies despite good horror films like (The Strangers) but Quarantine just comes out on top. Jennifer Carpenter (White Chicks, Dexter &amp; The Exorcism Of Emily Rose) gives a decent enough performance in this extremely tense &amp; scary movie. Jay Hernandez, Columbus Short and Steve Harris did good, too. Quarantine has just have about everything:some humor, a enough jump-out-of-your-seat scares, suspense, zombies,action and good performances. Quarantine is a perfect scary ovie to start the Fall of 2008 and probably takes the best horror movie of 2008 award.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quarantine review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine is an American remake of the movie Rec, a Spanish horror film released in November 2007. My initial thoughts of the movie were that it was going to be another atrocious Hollywood remake of a foreign film, such as The Ring and The Grudge. Granted, some people did enjoy the cheap scares and thrills that these remakes provided, but the overall reception of these movies within my group of peers was rather poor. This is where Quarantine differs.Quarantine is a film in first person perspective that follows a female newscaster and her cameraman on an assignment to show viewers a typical day in the L.A. Fire Department. The film starts of by setting a very calm atmosphere as the bubbly newscaster explores the firehouse and interviews firefighters. Eventually, the fire alarm sounds and she joins the firemen as they respond to a medical call within an apartment in downtown Los Angeles. The mood suddenly begins to grow more tense as we see that the call was about a person who has some sort of disease and is experiencing symptoms similar to that of rabies--the inability to swallow, partial paralysis, confusion and extreme aggression. Eventually the whole building is sealed off by the government to contain what ever disease is within. More and more people become infected and we watch as the characters of the movie fight to survive and escape the "Quarantined" building.The camera was controlled much better in this movie than it was in another first-person perspective movie that came out recently, Cloverfield. The camera work wasn't nearly as shaky as it was in Cloverfield, and people generally had a feel for what was going on at all times. The lighting was also an excellent aspect of the movie, as it seemed to parallel with the hopes of the quarantined victims.Like Cloverfield, many people are going to dislike the open ending and unanswered questions of the film. Fortunately, its much easier to piece together the origin of the virus and events preceding the movie. The movie also brings morality into question--was the government right in Quarantining the building and trapping the healthy with the infected? Is it okay to kill someone who is infected before the disease takes grasp and they lose all control, and is it okay to kill someone who has already been lost to the disease (despite their age or relation)? Another concept that I enjoyed about the movie was the makeshift weapons that were used. Unlike in many zombie-type horror movies where the main character or a supporting character has a gun with a seemingly endless supply of ammunition, the characters in this movie had to use whatever they could to fight off the infected victims.Overall, I felt the movie set a great, tense atmosphere full of scares and screams. I would highly recommend it, especially over most of the modern horror garbage that comes out (such as the latter Saw movies). If you don't mind open-ended movies or movies that take place from the first-person perspective, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Nosy News Reporters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Quarantine" is a film that, in the style of "The Blair Witch Project" (handy-cam filmed from characters' point of view), follows a news reporter named Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter, of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose") who is doing a story on the job of firemen for her local news station with her cameraman, Scott, filming footage and staying the night at the fire house. Finally, a call comes in, and the group goes to an old apartment building in downtown Los Angeles, where a call came from about an elderly woman who seemed to be in trouble. Angela, Scott, and the group of the firemen get to the building, and are attacked by the old woman, who seems extremely sickly and violently aggressive. Next thing they know, the apartment complex is locked down and sealed up by the CDC, all communication blocked and everyone inside trapped with no explanation, as a bizarre infection spreads between the people. The violent and horrific events that ensue are all caught on film as the night goes on.In the past few years, these first-person handy-cam style horror movies have had their fair exercise ("The Blair Witch Project", "Cloverfield"), and "Quarantine", a remake of a Spanish film called "Rec" is the same sort of deal. The benefit to this style of film-making is that it gives it a more realistic, personal view of things, rather than a conventional form of storytelling. The beginning of the movie starts off leisurely, giving a guide through the life of a fireman by the likable Angela Vidal character, who leads us through most of the film. Then when the call comes in, things set into motion, and the real horror kicks in from there. The set-up of the entire story is interesting enough and different from the usual, which is a definite plus here. The pacing is even and not too rapid, but I will say the final thirty minutes of the movie are absolutely hysteria-ridden, and I mean that in a good way.Suspense is sustained well, and the thrills and scare scenes are really well executed, there were a couple jolts that I didn't see coming at all ("It's only bronchitis!"), and this is coming from someone who watches horror movies all the time. I also liked the fact that, naturally, it had the audience questioning the motives of the CDC and law enforcement's reasoning for quarantining the building, which become fairly clear toward the end of the movie. But the first-person experience of it made you feel like you were sort of "there" to witness all the madness and the bloodshed (the gore is also notable here, it's not too over-the-top, but the special effects were done well). The shaky camera-work adds the raw and gritty feel to it all, but is still enough for the viewers to see what is happening - they got the balance between realism and visibility right down to the wire when it came to the steady-cam. Then again, there is always the "why don't they shut the camera off?" sort of question, which is unavoidable in a first-person kind of movie like this, so it has to be forgiven if one wants to enjoy it.The acting was surprisingly superb. Jennifer Carpenter carries the movie as her character (the sweet reporter who is dying to get a good story) is emotionally and physically exhausted, by the end of the movie she is an absolute mess and she plays it extremely well. Other notable faces are Jonathan Schaech and Jay Hernandez, who both play our 'heroic' firemen. All in the all the performances from everyone were realistic and the characters felt very real. As far as the ending goes, it leaves you hanging in a way, giving little in the way of explanation of the events, but rather hinting at things for you to make up your own answers in your head. That last night vision shot of Carpenter helplessly crawling toward the camera is haunting, and that final jolt (done to death in the film's advertising) will stick with you after you've left the theater.Overall, "Quarantine" is a nice change from the norm in the horror genre. It uses an unconventional form of camera-work and storytelling, but the entire set-up is well executed and it has its fair share of scary moments. I had a lot of fun watching it, and everyone in the theater seemed to enjoy it quite a bit as well. It's an entertaining flick that provides some good thrills, although it will probably be more enjoyable if taken with less seriousness. Fun, often gruesome movie, recommended for fans of the genre. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually improves upon the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2007 the Spanish movie REC generated an impressive buzz on the festival circuit as horror genre fan-boys, myself included, praised it as being one of the scariest movies ever made. Strong accolades, to be sure, but it was a film that pulled together elements from The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, 28 Days Later and the entire cinematic zombie cannon and blended them all together in a claustrophobic white-knuckler as terrifying as it was engrossing.It didn't take long before Hollywood took notice of REC's buzz, as Screen Gems scrambled to green-light an English-language remake, causing fans of the original to both bemoan Hollywood's lack of originality and predict that they would only botch the result. Which is why I'm surprised to write that not only is Quarantine every bit as good as the original, in some respects it actually surpasses it.In fact, the only area in which Quarantine failed to improve was in terms of the camera work. While both are built around the reality TV hand-held camera viewpoint, REC's cinematography was much more stable, whereas Quarantine's is so erratic as to be almost nausea inducing.Roughly 90% of this movie is a shot-for-shot remake of its predecessor, however the few deviations are key improvements over the original story, which, for the uninitiated, unfolds in a decrepit apartment building as fire department first responders, with a reality TV crew in tow, find themselves embroiled in escalating madness as a mysterious contagion begins transforming the occupants into homicidal ghouls.Writers Drew and John Erick Dowdle improve upon the original by providing the viewer with a more plausible and nuanced explanation of the disease and its inception, moving away from the macabre elements of REC in favor of a scientific basis - all of which makes Quarantine a bona-fide skin crawler, and just in time for Halloween.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quarantine was not that bad. It is a wild an intense movie. Many of the effects and method of filming we have seen before, yet I was intrigued by the story (although somewhat shallow). Acting was good. Sometimes the video would get a little irritating coming in and out of focus, which was there goal, but was annoying at times. As far as a standard horror, edge of your seat thriller I would say yes, see it. I am a huge fan of horror,and overly critical but this movie did have a little something different to offer. The story line is unique and original, but could have been improved. It does capture you, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Sure there is parts that might be considered somewhat predictable, but they are handled in their own unique matter. Overall, I would recommend this film to any fan of horror, you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quarantine, a horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went out to see quarantine today with a couple of friends. Now this isn't my opinion alone when i saw this. Starts out with the news team at a fire station where you meet a few of the main characters. Boring stuff some humor and then they get called to the apartment. The only good part of the film was the beginning. When you get into the movie like 20 minutes. It really starts to suck. I'm taking to filming classes and know some of the basics and what to spot. But any person can spot how the camera man, regardless first person this movie was meant to be shot in. Cant hold a camera still, it was horrible when the camera moved like it was a 9.0 earthquake. There were times he stayed still and it shook. It was like "Look a door!" and the camera shakes like the guy has Parkinson's. My two friends started getting motion sickness, and one of them almost puked from it (we were sitting up front) The story of the movie also is horribly stupid.***Spoiler*** Its some stuff about a mutant form of rabies. Jesus Christ, is that the best they could think of. Rabies that affects humans or some thing. And you get like 30 seconds of newspapers of some cult which could've added to the story but it didn't.***Spoiler***Also the last 10 minutes of the movie were completely worthless. And they ended it horribly to top it off.My advice if you wanna see it. Take motion sickness pills before the movie, its like getting sea sick. Hope you don't mind a stupid story line, and really bad crucial plot points.On the + side. It was brilliant acting by the main character Angela Vidal. She did a wonderful job acting in it, and was able to show excellent fear. She shook during a lot of parts and almost convinced me she was going into shock. So that was perhaps the only up side to the movie.End note: Don't see it, stupid movie. You'll hate yourself for seeing it. I feel bad for dragging my friends along after asking them for a week to see it. Its another well advertised film, which turns out to be horrible. I honestly wonder if the director ever saw this movie. If he had he would've slapped himself and recalled it. It makes me realize why you don't film 1st person. Does the director think himself witty for doing that. Because it was a dumb idea that should never be adopted to anymore films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor spoilers throughout, but nothing you couldn't have guessed from the first trailer: First, I just want to say that I am a huge fan of survival horror?which this is?and I'm a fan of hand-held camera movies. With that said, this has to be the worst I've seen of the genre.I've never seen REC, the movie this was based on, and now I'm positive I don't want to. This is nothing but yet ANOTHER virus-that-turns-people-into-zombies movie. I did not know that was the plot when I went in, and now I feel very cheated. I was expecting to see something along the lines of The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, which this is not. This is essentially just yet another 28 Weeks Later, Night of the Living Dead, Doomsday, etc., etc. that has zero originality and follows every cliché known to horror. Before you tell me, "Look, dude, I can care less about originality, as long as it's good." I have to say this: because this movie lacks originality, there is no intensity. You know what is going to happen from beginning to end. You know when something is going to jump at the screen. You've seen every single scene in this movie time and time again. I felt so bored because everything was spoon-fed to you. There was no mystery, nothing immersive. Just another lame virus-turns-people-to-zombies movie. Don't be deceived into thinking this actually has a plot line, like I was. There is nothing scary here. There is nothing intense. It's all so generic, I really wish I hadn't used my money on it because I've seen it so many times before. It almost reminds me of Ted Dekker's book "House", but nowhere near as intense or creative.The hand-held camera is almost a gimmick. Unlike Cloverfeild, where the camera-work was 100% noticeable at all times, Quarantine just felt like every other movie until the last twenty minutes. The camera stays relatively still throughout, like normal camera-work, and even uses cheap cuts like a standard film. I personally love the hand-held style, but this seemed to just use it as a gimmick.The reason Cloverfeild and The Blair Witch Project both worked was because they didn't tell you anything that the characters didn't know. The characters were just normal people, but in Quarantine there is no mystery. You're told in the first 40 minutes exactly what is going on and what is going to happen.Overall, this is just a boring dud. I'm sure there are some kids out there who will find it entertaining, but, seriously, it's just like everything else you've already seen. Don't be fooled.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reporter Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) and cameraman Steve Harris (Scott Percival) follow a firehouse crew on an emergency call to a creepy apartment building. A woman was screaming nonstop--and is now silent. They break into her apartment--and find her suffering from something and attacking and biting people. Soon two people are critically injured and need medical help...but the FBI blocks off all entrances and exits from the building and cuts off the electricity but why? Soon all the residents are fighting for their lives.God I HATE movies which are shown by the view of a camera! "The Blair Witch Project" started this and has a lot to answer for. That instantly lost me some points with this. THREE times during the movie I had to close my eyes because of motion sickness! That aside this does work. The setting is creepy and the acting is good all around although Carpenter overdoes it at times. Jay Hernandez gives the best performance. It moves quickly and keeps you off guard--I jumped more than once during this. For gorehounds this movie will work--the gore is STRONG! My only complaint is the explanation of what's going on is kind of rushed (I'm still not sure I understand it) and the constantly wavering camera. All that aside this is a good strong horror film. For strong stomaches only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave a perfect 10 for the movie because it entertained me from the beginning to the end and that is what I expect from a movie.I have to admit, the movie has it's logical flaws, I hope CDC does not handle emergencies as badly as in this movie but again, if everything goes smoothly there is no reason to make a movie, something must go wrong. Which brings me to my point: this is not a documentary movie. You don't see comments complaining about Battlestar Galactica that "it hasn't been proved that FTL jumps are possible" or "you can't cure radiation poisoning". This movie is a horror movie, it is supposed to scare you not to lecture you how to handle crisis situations. And if it did not scare you, maybe you watched too many horror movies and you are immune to them, next time try watching one alone after midnight when you are a little tired.I didn't see "Rec", so I cannot compare the movies but I think this one definitely worths a look. And if you did enjoy it I recommend you the movie called "28 weeks later".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quarantine is a movie that tries to push an old genre into a new direction at least for the standard American movie. While Cloverfield and the Blair Witch Project all tried to use the first person camera view for otherwise suspenseful plots, Quarantine is perhaps the best film so far to achieve something of a personal experience during a horror movie. The camera shots feel authentic and so director John Erick Dowdle should be noted for doing a good job.However, that doesn't mean there aren't problems. Quarantine is a movie that promises much and while it delivers for the first half the latter has much to be desired.Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) is a reporter covering the late shift of Los Angeles Fire Department station. With cameraman Scott Percival (Steve Harris), Angela is soon teamed with firefighters Jake (Jay Hernandez) and George Fletcher (Johnathon Schaech) who quickly show her how macho their job is. In between shots them showing off gear, the shower room, and them washing a fire truck, and the occasional bet on who can get into her Angela's pants first, Jake and Fletcher are two average firefighters who enjoy their job. Good shots but not quite the action that Angela is hoping for.Then the call comes. Angela and Scott soon jump on board Jake's and Fletcher's truck and ride off to what seems to be an average medical emergency at an apartment. An old woman, they are told, has apparently fallen and hurt herself. While not too exciting its enough for Angela to show off that something did happen.The reality of what they have walked into soon becomes apparent. The woman who they have responded for suddenly attacks a LAPD officer before being subdued. While Angela and Scott record everything with horror, Fletcher's falling body landing on the first floor lobby of the building only adds to the confusion and fear. Then, the military and the CDC show up along with a plastic covering that seals them inside with no hope of escape.Quarantine during this time introduces half dozen characters who we aren't really introduced to or even know by name. While this to be expected since Quarantine rests more on the camera's view to tell the story more than the characters, it can be frustrating in that we never really know who it is who is dying and why we should care. This becomes even more of a problem towards the end when everyone except Angela, Jake, and Scott are infected. And, what was once a clever way to introduce a story soon becomes shaking camera shots of Scott running while the three are chased by everyone up a flight of stairs until they are picked off one by one.The thrills in Quarantine are good as we try to understand what Angela, Scott, Jake, and Fletcher have walked into. The problem with Quarantine is that given the plot, and the way it is filmed, there is no real good way to end it. The deaths of everyone is expected which replaces the thrills with more horror and blood which while good is nothing special. The rumors of some kind of cult towards the end aren't really explained so we are left wondering if this was the work of one madman or some greater plan to destroy humanity. There are no real answers given which either gives more to the story or takes away depending on your point of view. The camera view can only do so much and it is unfortunate that we only have that to go on.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely one of THE BEST zombie movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am quite the connoisseur of zombie movies and all I got to say is *slow clap* brah-freaking- vo. I'm APPALLED that it scored so low on IMDb. This film has one of the best medical explanations for zombies and is a very well put together film. There are lots of ticking time bomb scenes where you know someone who's been infected is about to turn...it progressively gets faster and faster and with more hype. Smart plot and seems "plausible" for a zombie genre film, which makes it creepier. It's not off the wall zombie hordes everywhere, it's a more isolated or "quarantined," environment that has several jumpy scenes. Great acting, maybe except for the main actor, she can sometimes get annoying. Other than that, I'd say if you like/love zombie movies, or even just horror films, this is an absolute must see!</fullReview>

It is thousand times better then Cloverfield, this concept of hand camera really worked like a magic in this movie. I know this is the Remake of Spanish movie REC but honestly American version is far superior. Who wants to see this as a Spanish thriller anyway when clearly this genre belongs to the British and American. Jennifer Carpenter Gave an Oscar performance in this movie, every second with her felt as it was 100% realistic. And as far as the concept goes, it is fantastic. It's hard to understand how can zombies come alive but this movie does not have dead people walking, it's similar to 28 weeks later but on the base of reality. Kudos to the director and Kudos to Jennifer Carpenter! This one earns 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very creepy, very effective. One of the great horror films of 08</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine is an American remake of the movie Rec, a Spanish horror film released in November 2007. Remakes of foreign horror films are all the rage now in Hollywood. I think American writers, with the exception of Ehren Krueger and Richard Hatem (who I wish would write more) have run out of ideas so they have just left it up to foreign horror films to borrow their ideas from. You don't get a film as effectively creepy as the Ring and Blair Witch Project too often, but when you do, it should be embraced. This is one of those films. Quarantine is flat out scary.Quarantine is a film in first person perspective that follows a female newscaster and her cameraman on an assignment to show viewers a typical day in the L.A. Fire Department. The film begins rather mundanely as Angela, our intrepid reporter starts off by hanging out at the firehouse with some of the typical firefighters. One of them is Jay Hernandez, of Hostel fame. He is the "good" and "friendly" firefighter. He allows her to tag along, go places, and then when the alarm sounds, he encourages her to film everything, but stay out of the way.The mood changes abruptly once they are inside the building. What started out as a typical and ordinary call, has now turned dire as the building is sealed off, and they realize that some of the tenants of the building are experiencing what looks to be rabies type behavior--the inability to swallow, partial paralysis, extreme aggression, increased strength and mass confusion. And then the CDC shows up and begins to seal off the building. All the while, you hear sirens, helicopters and a throng of people outside the building. They will not let anyone out, including the firemen, the policemen or the camera crew. More and more people get bit and become infected with this mystery disease, and now they must fight for survival, from each other, from the military and from whatever disease has run amok in the building.The camera control in this movie was perfect. Never once did you ask yourself why they continued filming when their lives were in danger. They make a point of telling us several times that they need to film this to let the world know what is happening to them. The camera is also used as a weapon and as light in several parts of the film, all done very effectively.While the film itself, in it's entirety is very well done, the last 20 minutes is downright disturbing and incredibly scary. Without giving too much away, when the last survivors think they have found a way out, they discover a room as to where the virus might have started. And in it is what can only be described as another zombie type entity. Here they must fend for themselves and try to find their way out. You only have the light from the camera and some night vision, and it is here that Jennifer Carpenter is simply brilliant. She conveys her emotions and her fear brilliantly as she knows she is alone and to top it off, can't really see what is happening.The film raises all kinds of morality questions also. Was the government right doing what they did? Is it okay to kill someone when they haven't quite turned yet? Darwinism and questions pertaining to Darwinism are asked throughout.This is one of the most effective horror films to come out in quite sometime. This is what The Strangers could of been. This is also what many horror films aspire to be but ultimately fall short. There can be screenplay issues, an incompetent director or a combination of every deficiency possible, but refreshingly, Quarantine is not one of those films.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When television reporter Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) and her cameraman (Steve Harris) are assigned to spend the night shift with a Los Angeles Fire Station crew ( Jay Hernandez, Jonathan Schaech), a routine 911 call takes them to a small apartment building, where police ( Columbus Short) are responding to blood-curdling screams coming from one of the apartment units. When it's discovered that an older woman living in the building has been infected by something unknown, the CDC quarantines the building, with Angela, her cameraman, the fire fighters and police on the scene, and remaining residents(inlcuding Rade Serbedzija, and Greg Germann) locked inside. What happens next is a harrowing account of what occurs inside the closed off building via the footage taken by the TV Camerman. This is an American remake of the Spanish film "Rec" and basically follows the same storyline with a few changes including the reason behind the crazed residents. The fright -o-meter is on high and what develops is in esssence a visit to a haunted house full of creepy noises, dark hallways, and a bunch of "what is up ahead in the dark" occurrences and a whole lot of crazed rabid people leaping at you. Its done with expert direction and the actors are all good especially Jennifer Carpenter who does a bang up job of being scared out of her skin throughout. She's very believable in her performance and I am now an instant fan of hers! The last half of the film had me on the edge of my seat. I recommend seeing it. Accept it for what it is and enjoy the frantic crazy and at times humorous ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a lover of the horror genre especially zombie flicks, it was only a given that I would go out and watch this movie but knowing that Hollywood has been producing so many disappointing movies one after another I was pretty skeptical.I later found out that this movie was actually a remake of another movie called "REC". So I consider it fortunate that I watched the whole film having no knowledge what-so-ever to compare it to as well as not seeing the trailers(cause they always show the best parts anyways) I was curious what the film makers were going to do this time to separate it from all the other zombie flicks and I will admit that I wasn't to surprise to see that it became another "first person perspective" of watching the movie since pretty much this technique is starting to become a trend in the movie industry.The bad part was some of the logic that went into the building like why was everyone's apartment so dark? I know it was a very old building but I don't think that all the tenants want their apartments to be so gloomy. Could they not afford some better brighter lambs? They seem to be people who could afford it but I will let that go because it was obviously needed to help build the suspense for the story.Also did anyone notice that when they were trying to escape the military soldiers just popped out of nowhere to seal that particular area at that very moment. I would have thought if the virus was that serious they would have sealed off the whole building completely in just a few minutes.Third was the camera man, I find it amazing that anyone could possibly still be carrying a camera on top of their shoulders throughout that whole ordeal in a situation where people are chasing you and are trying to eat you alive while being confine in small tight areas.The really ugly part was towards the end where the news caster lady completely broke down into an over dramatic frenzy. I could not help but to laugh during those parts though I understood why the actress decided to portray that characteristic.Conceptually the idea of the story wasn't to bad since it all happens inside an apartment building which I thought was interesting to add confinement and claustrophobia to help create more tension in the scenes. I think it worked pretty well. I really liked the action scenes allot but i truly do not think it would have worked without the "first person perspective" though at times it did get a little nauseating. Over all its worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good Low Budget Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I went to see this today, since there was nothing else out that looked good. We are both serious horror fans, and I have to admit that we were both highly skeptical due to the stupid trailer we'd seen and had extremely low expectations. However, we were both pleasantly surprised--this is solid and highly entertaining little film. There were enough jumpy moments to keep my wife happy, and a hint of conspiracy to appease me, and though the premise is familiar, the story is packaged in a way that makes it feel fresh, exciting, and fun. There's some solid gore, a mostly plausible storyline (considering the premise), and kudos go to the sound crew who did a wonderful job with compelling thumps and splats--of which there are a great many! It's certainly not a perfect film: the shaky cam get a little too shaky, and the main character has incurable screaming-girl-syndrome, which becomes very irritating by the end. Aside from its flaws, for a low budget horror film, this was a wonderful surprise and I would recommend it to fans of the genre. Nothing new or groundbreaking here, but it's still a lot of fun.Note: I have not seen the original REC, so this review does not take into account any issues of its status as a remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as horror movies go, I have to place this one pretty high on the list. I do love a good horror movie, but most horror movies today aren't very good. There are so many more elements that play into making a scary movie than blood, guts, and a little profanity in order to make it a good one. This one has suspense up the wazoo, blood, guts, and a candor that is rarely seen in the horror genre these days. This movie looked exhausting to make. I think a few of these actors, particularly Jennifer Carpenter, got a loooong nights' sleep after wrapping the film. I got exhausted just watching them freak out. If you're looking for something that will make you cringe, jump, and possibly squeal, look no further. This one has just a little something for everyone. This is a good horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great horror movie with many jumps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine was a very suspenseful horror movie. It keeps getting creepier and creepier as the movie goes along. IN maybe one or two scenes I had my hands covering part of my eyes. I don't really jump in horror movies a lot but this movie made me jump a whole lot. This had to be the quickest and scariest horror movie I have seen yet this year. I did like how they made the movie though. It was all shot by one camera man the whole movie. It made the movie more realistic and scarier. The acting was little bit sluggish in some scenes. Jay Hernandez did a good job but the lead actress Jennifer Carpenter didn't do a great job but not horrible. I think that the ending is not what people are going to want. The movie was very intense the whole time. It didn't really have any slow moments once the action started. If you liker movies with the shaky camera then go see this movie. If you don't like the shaky cameras then go see this any way because it isn't that bad at all. The camera stayed pretty steady for the most part. Overall this was a very great fun horror movie that will make you scream and jump a whole lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's a Sharp, Powerful Horror Movie Like Quarantine Doing in the Present American Market?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quarantine is a beacon of hope for the slasher industry. Though it may be a diamond in the ruff, it is also pure cinema. Every nuance of the film's torturous mood descending and exposition is shown through the hand-held first-person camera, but the mise-en-scene it creates is so terrifying and chaotic that we are hardly conscious of the purposefully self- conscious narrative device. The gimmick works with such pared down bare-bones impact that we are completely emotionally absorbed, and we just run with it. The reason for this impact is because it is so completely and straightforwardly subjective that all of the action is seen with the utmost possible realism, as if someone were actually there and that we may find that we've been watching not only something that one character happened to have the curious fortune to record but something that has been lost for a long time, or that may never be found. The recent Cloverfield and The Blair Witch Project have been quite penetrating in their use of cinema verite, and many have and will probably overlook this one as a cash-in on the relative audience, but it not only surpasses the tension of either of those great films but makes one very anxious to seek out its Spanish source version, Rec.The authentic visual creepiness of this both fear-externalizing and immediate mass- extermination survival-of-the-fittest fright plot is given a chilling accent by the hyper- paranoid depiction, with its post-9/11 domestic terror skulking around every assumptive corner. In spite of the impressionistic black keys, the film is unrelentingly intractible: It only wants to scare you, and it does. Without fall back on computer-generated monsters or paranormal twists or divulgences, it uses stubborn reality and escapeless claustrophobia to find new ways of being scary. Primal, often frantic, and relentless in rhythm, Quarantine is a bare-bones bloody thrill ride that should fulfill fans looking to cultivate their theatrical horror palette.Even those who passionately hate most remakes, like me for example, will have to concede that director John Erick Dowdle's jittery English-language Xerox is unabashedly frightening. If a remake must be made in place of original thoughts and ideas (I'm talking to you, Michael Bay, you cheap bastard), one could do far worse. Quarantine is the real deal, an animal, stubborn sight of primal fear and desperation rendered uninhibited. Jennifer Carpenter is realistic as the news reporter who becomes locked away in her own story, and leads an uncompromisingly realistic cast, all of whom bring an embodiment of an ultimate nightmare to this unexpected treasure in the hands of the clear technical knack of the Dowdle brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget, but still kind of creepy ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first few minutes, you can sort of tell that is not a high budget movie, but they still managed make a better movie than most of junk horror movies that get made.My verdict: Overall it was worth seeing. If you don't mind the moving documentary "live-camera" style (like in The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield), then I'd say that first 3/4 of the movie is an 8/10 and the last 1/4 is a 6/10.One thing that the filmmakers did well was to create good atmospherics. There are some well-executed surprises that will get a lot of people a little jump in their seats. After the movie, I even felt some of the ambiance while driving out of an empty parking structure at night. The story is setup as follows: A TV crew is doing a kind of "day in the life of a firefighter" report. They follow the fire team to an apartment complex where an old woman is reportedly screaming. While investigating the situation, the old building that they entered is suddenly sealed off without any reason. The camera crew captures the horrific events that begin to happen inside.Another thing that Quarantine has in its favor is a strong acting job by Jennifer Carpenter. While it's a little overdone (and likely annoying to some) towards the end, I blame that on the script. The first half of the movie demonstrates that she is interesting to watch and is immersed in her character.While I didn't quite like the ending of the movie, the ambiance (as mentioned above) did succeed in creeping me out for a good while. It even overcame my initial dislike of what seemed to be a low-budget movie. All in all, this is a worthwhile movie to see if you want to get a few good scares at the theater. For horror fans, this is a "must see" for 2008.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Taking A Look!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I certainly was looking forward to seeing this movie and fortunately it didn't disappoint especially having used several unknown or small time actors!! Quarantine reminded me (story wise and cinematically of) George Romero's "Diary of the Dead". Cinematically it had a documentary look to it which I feel many more movies in the nearby future will end up striving for; such movies as Cloverfield, Diary of the Dead and now Quarantine have. Quarantine starts up a bit slow (due to the story and character development) but then the action starts to roll in almost non-stop. The story line was pretty good as was it's special affects and it had several unexpected elements/moments to make some viewers jump from their seats or squirm in them. Jay Hernandez's character (Jake the Firefighter) put in some real work throughout the movie and really made the movie for me while at the same time I was extremely disappointed in Jennifer Carpenter's character (Angela Vidal the Reporter) lack of strength and growth. (Possible Spoiler): When the crap hits the fan and anything that can go wrong does go wrong; her character (mentally and spiritually) collapses and never regains her composure (unlike a Jamie Lee Curtis from Halloween). Having said that though as I said earlier the movie is certainly worth being seen. Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the moment I saw the trailer for Quarantine, I knew I had to see this movie, I just love a good scare, especially around Halloween time. Well, I watched the first show this morning of Quarantine, I have to say, this a fun horror flick, but you know what? It's a little disappointing, it reminded me a little bit of The Blair Witch Project, the whole movie is alright, then the ending is getting so great, but then it goes to credits, you get all hyped up and can't breathe, then credits. Now it's much better than Blair Witch, but a step below Cloverfield, I did like the feel of the film, very much like a documentary and it did keep me interested. But it did get predictable; I have to say though that I felt like I was almost forced not to like this film with all the trash talk simply because it's a remake. Basically this film didn't stand a chance with most viewers, so as usual, I will give you the most honest comment I can write.Angela Vidal is a reporter who is doing a special on night shift jobs, the firemen, things seem pretty boring and that she won't get much of a story. But then the alarm rings, her and several firemen go down to a building where there are reports of a old woman screaming and is causing violence. The firemen, police, and Angela with her camera man go in to see what seems like a harmless but shook up woman, but as they turn the light on, we see her eyes are black and there is blood all over her dress and she attacks! Slowly all the residents and workers are attacked as the building has been quarantined and no one is going to be let out... alive.Now, Quarantine is worth the theater experience, don't get me wrong, I did enjoy a lot of the movie. I just felt like I have seen this before so the story could have been a little more scary, but it is intense and freaky. You'll get your scares, especially the end, I kind of wish now that they did most of the film in night vision because it made it feel more intense and real, not to mention it was just almost too scary to watch. I would recommend it for a couple good scares, seeing a scary movie in the theater is much more than seeing it at home, you get a more scared feeling in a place that's unfamiliar, so that's why I say go for the theater experience. This film was decent, it's just a little disappointing that the most intense and scary scene was the ending one, but oh, well, that's show business.6/10</fullReview>

Even the gory scenes were sometimes so dark and the camera was shaking so much, that it was hard to see who was doing what to whom. I found myself having to lean forward and squint and tilt my head and asking my friend what happened. The only reason my friend and I stayed in the theater was in hopes that the ending would reveal more, but it was disappointing in this regard. This movie was not worth the matinée price.</fullReview>

My theater was packed, and everyone was screaming, particularly in the last 1/2 hour! This movie is full-on horror with some really good acting, and the actors effectively portrayed these people who are fearing for their lives. This is definitely the best horror movie of the year so far, purely because of its creepy camera technique and the ability to scare the hell out of you!

		<fullReview>Just when you think you've become jaded to horror films and seen it all before, you get a little gem like this one. You think the plot's going to turn out to be "Oh, God, not another Blair Witch ripoff"', but this movie is more than that, effective in its portrayal of people trapped in a building with the government on the outside ready to kill them, and their fellows ready to kill them on the inside. The movie starts (as they often do) with a bunch of establishing shots of the TV hostess and the firemen doing firehouse stuff. It all seems harmless enough, until they actually get to what seems like a routine call, and all hell breaks loose. What makes this scary is that this is all kind of plausible. Some idiotic breeding a new kind of super rabies, lets it loose in the building and slowly, the residents succumb to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all of you out there that think this movie is bad, or disappointing, or are offended that it was based on another movie: YOU ARE IDIOTS! This is not an opinion, it is a fact. Please jump off a cliff, and spare the rest of us from your useless selves. This is a great movie. It's 28 Days Later meets Blair Witch Project, and it draws you in like a black hole, calm and sunny at the outer edge, becoming faster and darker as you are sucked into the depths of mayhem. It follows a perfect parabolic path into chaos. Highly recommended for anyone that is looking for a straight-up scare-fest. Like "The Ring" it is SUPERIOR to the original movie it was based upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just lost 1 hour and 29 minutes of my life watching this movie. I wish I could get that back but it is now lost forever. I would not recommend Quarantine to anyone. Not even to my enemies ! Save your money and spare that hour and 29 minutes of your lives by watching anything else. Five minutes into the movie I could tell it was going to be a bad one, and it got worst the more I watched. Should have walked out right then but going against my better judgment I stayed... now regretting that terribly. I have watched my share of horror and suspense flicks. My girlfriend was with me as we painfully watched this flick thinking that at some point it was going to get better but it did not. Credit should be given to the previews as it did attracted our attention. But that was it. People that are praising this movie should seek professional help regarding their judgment skills...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run! Its an awful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, I was excited at the idea that another good zombie movie might have come out. I was skeptical at first because the trailers made it obvious that everyone dies and I felt that an ending already ruined made this movie not worth seeing. However, I saw it anyway. Big mistake.First off, this movie in in first person. Didn't realize that before seeing it. Very like Cloverfield in that regard, however, the video work in this movie combined with the lighting actually made me sick. I threw up 2-3 times during the movie and had a terrible headache. Never had this happen before when watching a movie, and Cloverfield didn't affect me this way, but I was suffering from the camera work.Secondly, the movie makes no sense, there are so many things left out story wise that it seems like a bad B movie. It really is. I found myself criticizing it throughout the movie like you expect someone to do to the 13th part of a terrible sci-fi series. Things in the movie don't add up.Thirdly, the acting. It is all pretty bad. The range of emotions from people being put into this predicament is quite large. From irrational screaming to people being nearly totally content with the fact that they are going to die. People that turn to zombies have range of actions, some are beast like, others seem very much like people...that want to eat you. But even the normal situation acting is bad. But maybe that is the point. Maybe this was supposed to be a bad movie.Overall, the story was bad, the acting was bad, and the camera work was bad. The ending leaves you without any closure and explains nothing. Just ends abruptly. Character behavior constantly changes and the characters seem to constantly change. This is a bad movie. Outside the theater I went to, someone had just gotten hit by a car. I could only guess that they had just seen this movie and had suddenly developed a death wish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should be quarantined from the general populace. It's not worth wasting your time going to see. The "first person" camera work is intentionally shoddy in an in-your-face kind of way, which cheapens the effect. No professional camera man would go out of focus that many times.Another problem with the movie is that it is only 90 minutes in length, and I walked out exactly at the 30 minute mark. The movie was pure boredom and full of predictable dialogue the entire time. I was afraid the scary parts would be the same (this is the only fear I felt the entire time) so I walked out.Sure, maybe I missed the good parts, but I paid for 90 minutes of quality, not 60 minutes. It wasn't worth my money, and probably isn't worth yours either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I'd like to say I wasn't expecting much from this movie i was interested with the first person camera work. Since I haven't seen much of anything like this since Blair. ( However BWP will forever remain the best first person horror movie of all time.) I love how the begging of Quarantine threw me off with its relaxed friendly characters, Then it quickly became an edge of your seat horror ride, You never feel safe! I have never been happier walking out of a theater. Quarantine is beyond any movie you will see this Halloween season.....You will be holding your breath at times, remember to breath! Don't miss out on a truly unique look at fear itself. I do not recommend this movie to anyone under 17 its rated R for a reason people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rental.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I am a big fan of the Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield. Thinking that I would get something in between with Quarantine, I was wrong. The movie is shot from one pov camera. While at times bwp and cf camera-work was dark, lowlit, and shaky to bring realism to its documentary feel, Q just feels like a generic rip off. I can handle low lights and shaky camera work, but at least give the viewers a chance for suspense to be created.The story lacks suspense and scares. The story is bland and unrealistic. The acting while Jay Hernandez and Jennifer Carpenter are usually respectable, really fall flat. This movie will have you laughing much like an Evil Dead movie without the intended humor. The characters aren't very likable and you find youself rooting for their demise. The end, even the big payoff lacks and it is never explained why.It really is a been there done that film which has no real surprises and borderline poor acting, with major plot holes. You will be checking your watch waiting to get out of the theater. Please put it on your netflix cue but don't spend money on this.</fullReview>
