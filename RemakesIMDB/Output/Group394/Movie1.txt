		<shortDescription>98% of me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I was watching my VHS copy of Dark Victory this afternoon, there was a quote from Bette Davis that her role of Judith Traherne was her most personal and that it was 98% of me.It certainly is one of her most moving performances on celluloid. The movie is her show as so many of her Warner Brothers films were becoming at this point in her career. The rest of the cast almost stands back in awe of her.We would call Judith Traherne a trust fund baby these days. Poppa made a fortune and drank himself to death, Mom is over in Europe as an expatriate. And she's got a big house on Long Island where she raises steeple chasers and gives a lot of parties. But she's not an airhead. Bette Davis never was in any of her films. She's been having headaches and now blurred vision has been thrown in as a complication. When she crashes one of her horses into a side rail we the audience know right away that there are some serious health issues.Dr. George Brent is called in on the case, he's a brain specialist. He operates and it's a success, but only in terms of relieving the symptoms. She's got a death sentence hanging over her.The rest of the film is how she deals with it. Only an actress of incredible skill could have brought off the many mood changes that Judith Traherne has. If it wasn't for the fact that 1939 was the Gone With the Wind year, Davis might have gotten a third Oscar. She was nominated and lost to Vivien Leigh.Humphrey Bogart was in this as her stable groom with an Irish accent that he was clearly uncomfortable with. My guess was that the brogue was there to emphasize the class distinction between Davis and Bogart. I'm not sure it was all that necessary for him, but at least it wasn't as laughable as the Mexican accent in Virginia City.Geraldine Fitzgerald and Ronald Reagan are on hand as her two close friends. I understand that in the novel this is based on, Reagan's character is gay. This was the days of the Code, so gay was out. Probably in the long run helped Reagan's later career, given his politics playing a gay character wouldn't have gotten him entrée into his crowd. Still both he and Fitzgerald do very well as a couple of her friends who have a lot more character than most of them.George Brent was Davis's perennial leading man. She was involved with him romantically at some point during her Warner Brothers period, I'm not sure if it was during the making of Dark Victory. He was a competent player who Davis could be sure would never upstage her.I did however hear a clip from a radio performance of Dark Victory and George Brent's part was played by Spencer Tracy. Though Brent played in fact in the underplaying style that Tracy was known for, I'm sure if Tracy had ever done the film he'd have brought touches to the character that Brent could never have done. What a classic that would have been.Dark Victory is a moving story that never descends into soap opera. This is Bette Davis at her finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Death Creates a Passion for Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judith Traherne, under other circumstances, could be that unsympathetic rich bitch that parties hard, hasn't a care in the world, and is a victim of her own whims much like today's Paris Hilton. Of course, had this film been done today with the character molded after the blond twit, we would have not just hoped she met her maker but maybe spawned a hideous creature from inside that tumor growing inside her head and gone to Hell in a hand-basket. Instead, Judith is not without her good points -- she's flighty and impulsive but not a mean person. She has it all... until she begins to get those pesky fainting spells and persistent headaches.An actress who was at the top of her game at the time of the release of this movie, Bette Davis displays a marvelous gamut of emotions which layer her facial features and body language. This of course is crucial to understanding her character's psyche and if at times it seems a little overacted it's only because of the style of the times. Otherwise, her Judith rises above the male actors around her and comes to accept her destiny with beautiful dignity. Geraldine Fitzgerald, playing her friend and secretary Ann, is equally understated but moving as the one who stays by Judith's side. Both women reflect an interesting sisterhood about them; the transference of strength from one to the other is deeply affecting and one of quiet tears. Bette's final death scene is one of transcendent luminosity.Nominated for three Oscars including Best Picture, Actress and Music Score, DARK VICTORY found itself pinned under the massive competition that came out in 1939 and received not one, but stands today as one of Davis' quintessential pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judith is a wealthy Long Island society girl given to a dizzy lifestyle? Self-assured of her affluence and her faculty over men, she is unprepared for tragedy, which strikes in the form of a brain tumor? The underlying bravery and courage with which she faces this physical suffering eventually demonstrates the woman of substance that she is?Among her friends is Ann King (Fitzgerald), her secretary, and handsome young Alex Hamm (Reagan), who directs her toward brain specialist Dr. Frederick Steele (Brent). The doctor diagnoses her illness as one which will end her life within a year? Judith falls in love with him and accepts his proposal of marriage? When she discovers that her tumor is calamitous, she rejects the doctor's proposal considering it an act with compassion? Davis provides scene after scene with the special magic only she was able of bringing vividly? Swept into the current of events was Bogart playing an Irish horse trainer, who fails in an attempt to make love to her, yet encourages her to enjoy her time with her true love, George Brent? The film was remade in 1963 as "Stolen Hours" with Susan Hayward, and as a 1976 TV movie under its original title with Elizabeth Montgomery?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still gets me after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was probably 12 years old when I first saw this film on TV. It was shown in two parts and I didn't get to see the second part, so my mother had to tell me what happened. Forty years later, I still cry every time I see "Dark Victory." It remains one of my favorite films for sheer use of Kleenex and my favorite Bette Davis movie, "All About Eve" being right up there with it. I even saw it on the big screen in a revival house when I was in college. Yes, some of the dialogue sounds corny now, like the good doctor saying, "Women never meant anything to me before". But the interesting thing is, when I did see it with an audience, though they laughed as some inappropriate spots, by the end you could hear the sobs on the next block.There have been comments that Humphrey Bogart seems miscast in a somewhat minor role. I frankly thought he was just fine. He certainly was short enough to be a jockey and he pulled off the brogue. I'm sure it's confusing for some to see him in such a small role in 1939 when only a few years later, he was a total superstar. But he was under contract to Warners and kicked around for years before "High Sierra" and "Casablanca". He obviously wasn't working when "Dark Victory" was cast, so why let him sit around taking a salary and do nothing?And of course we have Ronald Reagan as a playboy. I actually find him delightful in this film. It called for charm and he had it.In today's fast-paced world, there's nothing stronger than a message about time and our use of it. "Oh, give me time for tenderness...just give me time." Like Bette's character, I want to hear that song again too, in many more viewings of "Dark Victory."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate tear-jerker!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only is this sublime classic the greatest tear-jerker of all time (well, let's call it a tie with "Lassie Come Home"), it also contains one of the greatest performances ever given by Bette Davis. In the hands of a lesser actress this movie could have been a soppy pot-boiler. In the hands of Ms Davis it is close to being a masterpiece. If most of the supporting players can't match her it's no wonder - Bette is truly inspired here! The normally fine Geraldine Fitzgerald seems rather self-conscious in a difficult role (and an early one for her), and George Brent can't handle the really emotional stuff. But Bogart is stunning in that sexually charged scene with Bette in the stables. Ronnie doesn't have much to do, but Virginia Brissac is memorable as Martha and Henry Travers terrific as the old doctor.Above all this is the excellent direction of Edmund Goulding, the fine cinematography of Ernest Haller and the great music of Max Steiner. Sure, dying in real life is never this beautiful, but don't we all wish we could go out with the style that Bette Davis does? Be warned: the last 15 minutes of this film are almost torturously moving - but then ALL of "Lassie Come Home" is. And don't we just love a good cry!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supreme tear-jerker is skillfully handled...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three central performances in DARK VICTORY that deserve praise for their sincerity and complete believability--BETTE DAVIS as the spoiled heiress, GEORGE BRENT as the doctor who falls in love with her and GERALDINE FITZGERALD as the conscience of the story, feeling pity and love for her dearest friend. Davis trounces around through the first half to show us what kind of energy and volatility is flaring beneath the surface--so full of life that when she realizes her illness bears the stamp of "prognosis negative", it's a shock to the audience as well as the actress. She's at her level best in all of the quieter moments--and never more impressive than in the final ten minutes of the film where her character must face the impending death with dignity and the knowledge that she has her husband's love and her best friend's devotion.The scene in the garden with Fitzgerald at her side is the most luminous in the entire film. It's worth waiting for just to watch two great actresses at work.Max Steiner's score is fitting at all times--even in the final moments when Bette goes up the stairs accompanied by his melancholy main theme. Edmund Goulding gets sensitive work from his entire cast--with the exception of Ronald Reagan who is given absolutely nothing in the way of character development except to look tipsy in every scene. To say that he is wasted is an understatement. So too is Henry Travers as the doctor who brought Davis into the world. Humphrey Bogart has been criticized for his Irish accent, but he's at least acceptable in a minor role as a horse trainer.But the three central performances are what hold the film together--and make what is essentially a sob story work so beautifully.Trivia: George Brent is very effective in the doctor role that was first offered to Basil Rathbone, but then withdrew after a very bad screen test in the part convinced the studio (and Rathbone) that he was all wrong for the role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bette's victory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark Victory" is a classic film of the 30s. In some movies, like this one, all the elements came together to create a satisfying entertainment that has delighted audiences since its release in 1939. Edmund Golding was instrumental in getting one of the best performances out of Bette Davis. The movie is helped by the fine score of Max Steiner.As Judith Treherne, Bette Davis shows us why she was a great actress. She does some of her best work in this picture. Her interpretation of the socialite is right on target. Ms. Davis goes from a happy go lucky rich girl into the woman who has to face an imminent death. This film is so enjoyable because of the nuances Ms. Davis brought to the role. Bette Davis' range was enormous.George Brent, as the medical specialist who tries to help Judith, and falls in love with her in the process, is also quite good as Dr. Steele. Geraldine Fitzgerald is wonderful as Ann, Judith's loyal friend. Humphrey Bogart appears briefly as the horse trainer. Henry Travers put in a small appearance as the doctor who brought Judith into the world, and sadly, is not able to help her much. Also in the cast, Ronald Reagan, who doesn't have much to do.This is the perfect film to watch the wonderful Bette Davis at her best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love or hate her, this film shows why Bette was a star...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By today's standards, "Dark Victory" might seem cliched. Of course, that could be because it was so greatly copied! Here is Bette Davis, a star in the fullness of her talent and ability. Bette simply shines; she owns this film from first frame to last. Ably supported by a wonderful cast (including a somewhat mis-matched Humphrey Bogart as an Irish-brogued horse trainer), it is still difficult to watch the film and not be constantly anticipating Bette's appearance in any scene she isn't in. The ending, even in those days, might have turned out either wimpy or waspish. In Bette's hands, it is neither. It works in a way that literally drains one of emotions. I might also add that, while revealing only a bare back, Bette shows more sensuality than a dozen of today's more "open" actresses.There is an old disparaging adage about "showing the full gamut from a to b," in this movie Bette not only shows A to Z, but some letters that haven't been invented yet.Despite my gushing over Ms. Davis, the film is solid in all departments. If you wish to experience when melodrama is great movie-making, see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Bette Davis movie, but I was surprised it had a credit error.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie three times (once in a theater) and it seems to get better with each viewing. There is no question that this is one of the best movies Bette Davis had made, with her skill evident in every scene she's in. With an able supporting cast, especially by Geraldine Fitzgerald and George Brent, and a fine Max Steiner score, movies do not get much better. I loved the scene where she orders "prognosis negative" in a restaurant just to let Brent and Fitzgerald know that she knows she's been lied to about her condition. It's just a wonderful movie.I was surprised that such a prestigious film would have a credit error. The end credits list Lottie Williams as playing Lucy, where in fact she plays Agatha. Lucy was played by Diane Bernard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film of which Davis is supposed to have said "There are some pictures that should nevah be remade!" - and time has proved that she was right. Despite two updates/remakes, one theatrical ("Stolen Hours" with Susan Hayward) and one for TV (as "Dark Victory" with Elizabeth Montgomery) it's this 1939 Warner Bros. film which is still best remembered today. The reason, of course, is Bette Davis. She often insisted that there wasn't one of her greatest roles she didn't have to fight to get, and Judith Traherne was one of those roles. She pestered Jack Warner to buy it for her, and when he responded "Who wants to see a picture about a dame who goes blind and dies?" Davis assured him that at least ten million women would - and she was right.And so we have a vibrant, touching performance that is among the most famous jewels in the crown of Bette Davis. "I'm young and strong and nothing can touch me!" she proclaims, and almost makes us believe it. We see her go through the denial/anger/bargaining/acceptance phases of her illness long before anyone named those stages. And when she looks George Brent in the eye and says "Poor fool - don't you know I'm in love with you?" we know from the way she says it that she's never said it before. Yes, it's quite possible that had GWTW not been released in the last weeks of December 1939, the question of who would be the first actress to win 3 Best Actress Oscars might well have been settled long before 1968.Yes - we have to suspend disbelief here - Bogart with an Irish brogue? Surely his name - O'Leary - should have been enough. And the scene near the end when Davis packs Brent's suitcase to send him off - how could he not notice her fumbling around the room? Ah well, "it's only a mooovie, Ingrid. . . ." as a famous director once said."Dark Victory" may not be great cinematic art, but it's a thoroughly professional effort and it's obvious that the people who made it cared about it. Movie fans have been caring about it for 66 years, and continue to do so: a newly-remastered DVD will be released in June.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Sentimental Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The twenty-three years old wealthy sportswoman Judith Traherne (Bette Davis) has painful headaches and double-vision, and the family doctor, Dr. Parsons (Henry Travers), convinces her to go with her best friend Ann King (Geraldine Fitzgerald) to a consultation with a famous specialist. After the physical examination, Dr. Frederick Steele (George Brent) finds that Judy has a lethal glioma brain tumor, and he immediately operates her to withdraw the tumor. However, the result of the biopic examination indicates that she has less than six months of life, but Dr. Steele and Ann hides the diagnose from Judy. Meanwhile, Judy and Dr. Steele fall in love for each other, and they decide to get married and move to Vermont. But Judy finds the correspondence from the laboratory and very depressed, she starts to drink and have a promiscuous life. Later, she realizes that she should spend the last moments of her life with her love."Dark Victory" is a wonderful sentimental movie with three nominations to the Oscar: Best Lead Actress (Beth Davies), Best Music Score (Max Steiner) and Best Picture (David Lewis). Although having an unpleasant theme, the message is beautiful and never corny. Bette Davis is amazing in the lead role, very well supported by Geraldine Fitzgerald and George Brent. Humphrey Bogart in beginning of career in the role of a horse whisperer, and the ham actor Ronald Reagan in the role of a playboy have a minor participation. Warner do Brasil only recently released this DVD in Brazil, in a Box with three other excellent movies of Bette Davies. Unfortunately, the Brazilian DVD has a great error in Chapter 18: the subtitles of the lyric of the song "Time for Tenderness" have the word "@ confirmar" (meaning "to confirm") on each line. I believe that who translated the song, wanted to confirm the translation, and sent the draft without deleting the markings to the DVD authoring. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Vitória Amarga" ("Bitter Victory")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great. It lets you see how the great actress "Bette Davis" can really act with this performance. At first she is strong and forthright (the way we all remember her) but, then when she faces death turns very compassionate for others. She doesn't dwell on anything she lives every moment as if it was her last. You will see Humphrey Bogart in a supporting role as a horse trainer. Bette plays a 23 yr. old whose father died and mother lives far away and is never around. She lives it up with huge parties and going everywhere. She doesn't worry about anything and let's things wait to happen in years ahead. That all changes with a blink when she enjoys everything and does things she was putting to the side like love. With all that she experiences things she wishes she only had done before. The bottom line - she falls in love and experiences the real meaning of happiness to simply enjoy life. You'll love her performance and the others in the cast too because they all have a place there not just there like in other films for no reason. "Dark Victory" makes all of us want to triumph over life and this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Davis' Definitive Vehicle Rests on Her Still Brilliant Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming in the middle of her tumultuous, 18-year reign as Queen of the Warner Bros. studio, this classic 1939 tearjerker proved to be the ideal vehicle for the mercurial talents of Bette Davis in her prime in a year marked by so many other memorable films. Adapted by longtime studio screenwriter Casey Robinson from a short-lived 1934 Broadway play, the story involves Judith Traherne, a frivolous, self-absorbed heiress, living hard in the fast lane at 23, who finds herself confronting her own mortality with the discovery of an inoperable brain tumor. Naturally, she denies anything is wrong with her at first but faces the reality of her condition by eventually rising to the occasion with courage and integrity. It has been the subject of many parodies and at least two remakes in the past seventy years, but the original still works best thanks to Davis' career-defining performance.Besides Davis and Max Steiner's equally emotional score, the movie itself has not aged as well due to the pedestrian work of director Edmund Goulding ("Grand Hotel") in guiding the venture and lackluster contributions from the supporting cast, one of whom is seriously miscast In hindsight. Judith's Long Island social world is full of hard-drinking party types like the perpetually drunk Alec who tries to woo her into marriage. He's not the only one as Irish stable hand Michael is equally smitten with Judith, but there's the social class distinction to consider. The novelty is that a young Ronald Reagan plays Alec and Humphrey Bogart, two years from his breakthrough in "The Maltese Falcon", plays Michael. Reagan does not make much of an impact, but Bogart is sorely miscast as Michael to the point of being distracting as Davis blows him off the screen, in particular, a late-night failed seduction scene when she dismissively half-asks him, "You're making love to me, aren't you?"However, it is Judith's steady best friend Ann and especially the stalwart brain-cell specialist Dr. Steele who help Judith in her true victory over the dark. Both Geraldine Fitzgerald and constant Davis co-star George Brent do solid work in the roles, but nothing nearly at Davis' caliber. Perhaps this was intentional, but it does make for an odd imbalance to the film. Regardless, the last twenty minutes pull at the requisite heartstrings as Judith faces her fate with a heavenly choir. It's a grand Davis sequence worthy of her legacy. The print in the 2005 DVD release is nicely restored. Film historian James Ursini and CNN film critic Paul Clinton provide a perceptive commentary track, and there is a short featurette that explains how the film's reputation has unfairly suffered over the years. See the film itself for the vibrancy and depth of Davis' performance which hasn't aged a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can just picture theater patrons leaving this movie during it's original release, not a dry eye in the house; an endearing testimony to the strength of Bette Davis' portrayal of the young snooty socialite turned human over the course of the story. As Miss Judith Traherne, Davis exhibits a wide range of emotion in her role, helping establish her reputation as one of film's finest actresses.Along the way, Davis is supported by an unusually strong contingent of Warner contract players, most notably George Brent as the doctor turned husband, Frederick Steele. Established in a highly successful surgical career, Steele is continuously frustrated in his attempt to semi-retire to a life of research at his Vermont farm. Miss Judith is just his latest diversion, one that his professional reputation and personal responsibility will not allow to go without helping. During his association with Judith, he manages to fall in love, while creating the same intense and wonderful feelings in her. Where his nobility fails is in his attempt to keep Judith's true condition secret from her, in collaboration with Judith's best friend, Miss Ann (Geraldine Fitzgerald). Fitzgerald's performance in it's own way is almost as touching as Davis' own, as the loyal friend and confidante who must watch her best friend slowly fade toward an unhappy ending.Ronald Reagan appears a number of times throughout the film as a member of Davis' social circle, and whether by design or not, he never appears sober. Henry Travers, the diligent wing earning angel from "It's a Wonderful Life" appears as Miss Judith's family physician in a subdued role. And to be completely honest, my original interest in this film was in completing my collection of Humphrey Bogart movies; here he has minimal screen time as a horse trainer with an eye for Miss Judith who realizes that his station would never allow for such a match up. It's interesting to see Bogey near the end of the film in the obligatory trench coat for which he's well known.The film's ending is powerful and given added poignancy as Miss Judith plants a flower bulb after sending her husband off to an important medical gathering. With Judith's vision dimming, Miss Ann cannot contain her tears and is sent off by Miss Judith as well to remember happier times. As Judith stumbles up the stairs to her bedroom, the maid symbolically draws the curtain against the sunlight, while Judith says a final prayer, and it's over. Commence tears.To date, my viewing of Bette Davis films have been limited to her collaborations with Humphrey Bogart, but that's a total of six films, more than any other pairing with my favorite actor. Edward G. Robinson appeared with Bogey in five films, and one of them, "Kid Galahad" also featured Bette Davis, once again in a role showing many facets of her ability. Intrigued as I am with her performance in "Dark Victory", I'll be looking forward to more of her films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performances In This Bittersweet Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark Victory" features a superb performance by Bette Davis, portraying Judy Traherne, a socialite struggling to come to terms with terminal brain cancer, a diagnosis that ironically brings her the greatest joy of her life, as she falls in love with and marries the doctor who diagnosed her, also superbly played by George Brent.There's nothing really to dislike in this movie. The basic point is simple to figure out: whatever darkness you may face, make the best of it and live life to the fullest, because even in darkness there may be victory. The supporting cast is tremendous, particularly Geraldine Fitzgerald as Ann King, Judy's friend and assistant who helps her through this bewildering time of conflicting emotions. The movie is not exactly filled with suspense and there's no dramatic death scene, but the emotion is raw all the way through, and the sympathy the viewer feels for this couple who are so much in love but have so little time to enjoy it is very real.This is very well done, and well worth a look see. I would rate it as a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Dramatic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely a tear-jerker involving a young socialite Judith Traherne, (Betty Davis) who is full of life and an only child who gets her own way all the time, but is well liked by everyone. Judith loves horses and enjoys riding them and performing with them in various horse shows. The trainer of these horses is Michael O'Leary, (Humphrey Bogart) who loves his work and likes Judith because of her love for animals. One day Judith is riding her horse and her vision becomes blurred and she sees double and falls off the horse. It seems Judy is having bad headaches but does not mention it to anyone and her own doctor refers her to a Dr. Frederick Steele, (George Brent) who is a brain surgeon. Ronald Reagan appears in this film as a playboy drunk who is always drinking. Great performance by all the actors, but bring the tissue box, you will need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Bette Davis gives a virtuoso performance here as Judith Traherne, a young, rich, headstrong woman who has a brain tumor. At first she denies her symptoms, the headaches, the blurred vision, the loss of sensitivity in her right arm, the fainting spells, but then she is taken to Dr. Frederick Steele (George Brent) who is about to quit his practice and devote himself to medical research. A wonderfully animated Bette Davis shows us how a young woman might react as she is won over by a man to whom she is becoming increasingly attracted. As he examines her she goes through the stages of reluctance, acquiescence, attraction, and then the headlong fall toward love.Dark Victory is famously known as a "three-hankies tear-jerker" and it is that for sure. If you can keep a dry eye through the last reel, you need to have your pulse taken. This is a tragedy with a silver lining, a human victory over the darkness to come. It is melodramatic with the focus on the utter capriciousness of the tumor that medical science cannot arrest, and on what it is like to go from happiness to despair, to the depths of depression, and then to acceptance and even a since of triumph. Davis takes us on this bumpy ride in a most convincing manner.Humphrey Bogart is the trainer of horses who loves Judith from afar. Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Judy's best friend Ann King. Ronald Reagan has a small part as Alec Hamm, a rich drunk. Edmund Goulding directed. He is the auteur of many fine movies from the studio days of Hollywood, most notably perhaps, The Razor's Edge (1946) and Of Human Bondage (1946). The movie was adapted from the stage play by George Emerson Bremer Jr. and Betram Bloch.(Beware of possible spoilers to come.) I would like to see the script of that play because I think there is something in this movie that was handled so delicately as to be unrealistic and even unnatural. Although Dr. Steele and Judith declare their undying love for one another, we do not see them in a scene involving physical passion. The reason for this may have been because Goulding didn't know what to do about sex and the consequences of sex in a married woman who has but a few months to live. The implication is that their marriage may not have been consummated in the usual sense.Also handled delicately--but very well, I think--is the relationship between Ann and Dr. Steele. At one point Judith has reason to believe that Ann and Dr. Steele have been intimate, but they have not, and she comes to realize that, although they have grown close because of their mutual love for Judith. Yet at the end Judy makes her friend swear that she will take care of Frederick after she is gone. We in the audience believe that she will and we also believe that that "care" is bound to blossom into something more.If you want to know how Bette Davis became a great star, this movie is a great place to begin. She considered this her favorite role of a lifetime and it is not hard to see why. The part allows for a wide range of emotion. Vivacious, energetic Judith is a sympathetic character, yet there are places in the story where Davis is able to be the hard, mean Bette Davis that we know from other movies, and other places where she is as light and frivolous as an airy teen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Davis drama from 1939</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a previous review of a Bette Davis film, I alluded to her amazing range; she can either play the bitch or she can play the martyr. In Dark Victory, she gets to do both. As Judith, she finds out that at the ripe age of 23 and at a very inconvenient time in her social calendar, that she has a fatal brain tumor. George Brent plays the doctor who diagnoses her, and of course, her love interest. Members of a fine supporting cast include a very young Humphrey Bogart, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Ronald Reagan. (Who hilariously plays a social playboy/boozehound.)This film is definitely a classic, and is a fun one to watch ? it's worth it just to watch the scene in the restaurant when Bette orders a `Prognosis Negative' after she finds out that she is dying. Dark Victory is yet another piece of evidence that 1939 was the golden year of cinema. --Shel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good sentimental melodrama from that great year of 1939...Davis and Fitzgerald are wonderful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the films she made, Bette Davis thought this her finest role and greatest performance. That's a pretty big statement from a woman considered to be perhaps the finest screen actress of all time, and one who turned in countless excellent performances. Yet Davis is truly fantastic here, as is Irish actress Geraldine Fitzgerald in a supporting role. It's a pity that other elements of the film don't hold up as well today (or even back then) as the acting of Davis and Fitzgerald.At it's most basic, DARK VICTORY is pure melodrama. Society girl Judith Trahene, who spends most of her time riding horses and throwing wild parties, is shocked into discovering the true meaning of life when she finds out that she has an incurable brain tumour. At first, her doctor (George Brent, who falls in love with Davis) decides not to tell Davis the true extent of her illness after surgery (medical ethics are questionable here, yet it's a plot device). However, Bette finds out and, even though she does succumb, she dies gracefully, having some sort of "victory" over the dark.As I said earlier, Davis and Fitzgerald are magnificent. Fitzgerald gave two great supporting performances in 1939 (the other came in WUTHERING HEIGHTS) and I believe this lovely Irish lady would have walked away with Oscar (she was nominated for the Goldwyn film)had GONE WITH THE WIND not also premiered that year (Hattie McDaniel won the Oscar, in a tight race over Olivia de Havilland. Davis believed she deserved the Best Actress Oscar for this film, and while she is terrific, I feel Vivien Leigh was the rightful choice that year.So, let's look at the rest of the film. Brent was a frequent Davis co-star, and although he lacked good looks and a strong screen personality, he seemed to complement her well, and he is quite good in his role. Henry Travers appears briefly as Davis' life-long doctor who sadly cannot help her. Ronald Reagan has a small role as a playboy, and he doesn't have to do much except act tipsy. Bogart is terribly miscast-actually, I think it's the worst Bogart performance I have ever seen (though I have not yet caught up with the infamous SWING YOUR LADY or DOCTOR X, but do I really want to??). He's the horse trainer, Michael, and it's hard to believe Bogart could ever be ineffectual or cringe-worthy in a film, but watch this and find out.As for the technical elements, they are indeed well-polished yet not in the league of other films of that same great year. The script is reasonably strong, yet it has a few overly melodramatic moments that probably wouldn't have worked well in 1939, and definitely don't hold up well today.Greatest scene on the film? Fitzgerald and Davis in the garden.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Woman Determined To Live and Die On Her Own Terms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis may have had several roles that the public identify with her more than Judith Traherne. But Judith's plight is actually the most tragic of all of them. Judith is young, attractive, lively, and rich. But she's suffering from a brain tumor.A line of dialog at the start of the film made me wonder how really up-to-date the screenplay was. Dr. Frederick Steel (George Brent) is a society surgeon with a great practice, but he is about to leave New York City for his farm/laboratory in Vermont to do research into cells (particularly those that turn deadly as in cancer cells and tumors). He is telling a visitor about a recent patient of his - a promising composer who had started working on a new composition just before Steel performed brain surgery. As he says very sadly the operation was a success but the patient died. In 1939 Americans would have picked up on that particular line. A year earlier America's leading popular composer, George Gershwin, was diagnosed with a brain tumor and had a well reported operation in Los Angeles, California. He survived about a week. Dr. Steel is approached by a colleague Dr. Parsons (Harry Travers) regarding Ms Traherne. Besides being a family friend and the doctor who brought her into the world, Parsons was one of a dozen witnesses the previous week when Judith took a spill on one of her champion horses. She has been complaining (but dismissing) a series of headaches. Steel agrees to see Traherne (who is sitting outside with her friend and secretary Ann King (Geraldine Fitzgerald). Traherne is friendly but again dismissive of the problem of the headaches. Steel is keen eyed enough to see that Judith is having problems focusing her eyes, and reacts badly to sunlight (she's squinting too much), and she is burning her fingers (due to accidents while lighting her cigarettes). Steel drops his plans to go to Vermont in order to take care of Judith.There is an operation, and it is an apparent success. In the meantime Judith and Frederick begin finding each other rather pleasant company and a romance begins. Judith resumes her social activities with her equestrian shows (involving her horse trainer Michael O'Leary (Humphrey Bogart)), and her social set involving her male pal Alec Hamm (Ronald Reagan). But she is soon aware of Frederick and Ann spending too much time together, and while first thinking the obvious she soon comes across a medical report from some expert that Frederick uses on his serious cases. She confronts them at a restaurant with the knowledge that she is fully aware that while the operation was a temporary success the tumor cells are reemerging.After a period where Judith tries to forget the coming disaster with Alec and her chums, she finds little solace there. Her best adviser at this point is Michael, who tells her she should try to find as much happiness for her remaining days as she can. The irony (for Michael, of course) is that he always has loved Judith but he can't compete with Frederick. Nor can Alec, who later confesses as much to Frederick*(*Ronald Reagan later explained that Edmund Goulding told him to play Alec as an alcoholic homosexual. This was a bit beyond what Reagan liked to be seen as, so he did not go as far out as Goulding wanted him to do. Yet to be fair, Alec's behavior as Judith's closest male confidante comes close to what Goulding suggested. Besides, one can make a similarly negative comment about Bogart's use of an Irish accent, but for the purposes of the film it's fine.)SPOILER COMING UP:Frederick and Judith get married, and we see her doing everything in her power to be as loving and close a wife as she can, while Frederick is trying to live for her each day without thinking of the inevitable. They do leave the New York City and Long Island Social Set for Vermont, and she does help him set up his lab and (with Ann along as secretary) sets up his professional lecture and conference appointments. It seems to be working, but then comes the last fifteen minutes of the film.Frederick has a conference out of state, and has to catch a train. Judith has been helping him pack, but while out in her garden with Ann she is aware that she is seeing less and less. Ann becomes aware of this too, but Judith tells her not to say a word - they both know that it is the sign of the last minutes of her life. They go through a careful pantomime where Judith acts as though nothing is amiss, and Frederick is unaware that the end is approaching as he leaves. With the help of Ann and her servant Carrie (Cora Witherspoon) Judith gets up stairs to lie down on her bed and die with dignity.I can only add that my description of the last twenty minutes does not do close to full justice to how Davis and Fitzgerald handle that last portion of the film. DARK VICTORY happens to be one of those "women's pictures" that really work. The subject, for a change, is dramatic but realistic. While sex triangles and unhappy marriages and alcoholism are parts of life, most of us relate to the fragility of life and how it can all come crashing down due to our physical construction. It's bad enough for the bulk of us, but when (like Traherne) you have one of the best of life styles it is agonizing. Unlike so many of these so-called "women's pictures", DARK VICTORY is one that men find as fascinating to watch as women.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casey Robinson wrote at least four great vehicles for Bette Davis; Now, Voyager, The Old Maid, The Corn Is Green and this one and though it may be just coincidence that these were written and produced in the same six year period (1939-1945) that paralleled World War Two and represented the period when Davis was at the top of her game, it could just be that writer and actress struck creative sparks off each other. On paper much of this is risible, not least the wonderfully apt name Alec Hamm sported by Ronald Reagan, closely followed by Bogie's pathetic Irish accent and his classic line on being rejected by Davis 'is it because I'm just a stable-hand', okay, East Lynne it's not but it's certainly in the same ballpark. Henry Travers was more effective as Clarence, the tyro angel in It's A Wonderful Life, where he eventually did save Jimmy Stewart from that date with the Grim Reaper, this time around he can't replicate that trick for Bette Davis even though he's now a bona fide doctor and, as he never tires of repeating, the doctor who brought Judith Traherne (Davis) into the world. This is, let's face it, soap opera albeit luxury soap and if you can suspend your disbelief there's much to admire not least of course the bravura performance of Davis which is given honorable support by George Brent and Geraldine Fitzgerald. Like the man said, they don't make 'em like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best actress of her generation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had previously allowed my views of Bette Davis, the person, to taint my views of Ms. Davis, the actress. Hearing of incidences of petulant behavior, as well as having had frequent observations of her volcanic personality, I denied myself the privilege of seeing Ms. Davis on the screen. However, while flipping through the dial one evening, I came upon a movie partway through, starring Ms. Davis and George Brent, and decided to watch. Even as the movie had concluded, I had no idea of what I had just viewed. I knew only that I was deeply touched by Ms. Davis'. character and her heroic struggle to enjoy her last days in the face of great adversity. After seeing her remarkable performance in what I learned later was the picture Dark Victory, I can only say the talent of Ms. Davis is unsurpassed, and perhaps unequaled by any actress of her generation. The powerful screen presence and superb acting ability of Ms. Davis, literally bowled me over. Bravo!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bette's Greatest Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Gone With the Wind fan and love Vivian Leigh, so when I heard that Dark Vicrory's Bette Davis lost the Oscar by a very few votes, I was surprised. Even though Bette Davis is my favorite actress of all time. So I watched Dark Victory. I love this movie and now feel that Bette should have won, it was the greatest acting her career. The movie is beautiful and has several great supporting performances. Including Ronald Reagan (as a great drunk), Geraldine Fitzgerald and Bogie. The wonderful story flows and when you mix in Bette's great work, this movie shines. The beginning of the movie details young Judith's status as a socialite perfectly, you don't hate her like you could by today's standards. Then the dramatic diagnosis and medical drama leads directly into the healing of body and soul. The love story and friendships are portrayed to perfection. Bogie even becomes lovable, which shows how Judith as changed since falling in love. I would recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Epitome of Davis Soaps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis always cited this as her favourite role: it is probably on a par with Margo Channing in ALL ABOUT EVE as the part which fans identify with as definitive Davis. Naturally, this 1939 film will look a little musty, corny and cliched to modern day viewers, but the poignant sincerity in which Davis instilled via her magnificent performance still has the ability to leave the viewer in helpless tears: you can be dumbfounded to think that something so obviously aimed at your tear ducts could succeed to induce the flow so completely and spontaneously! The role is based upon a 1934 play in which Tallulah Bankhead flopped. The character of Ann King was written especially for the film by director Edmund Goulding: as a kind of Greek Chorus so Judith wouldn't have to complain about the inevitable. Geraldine Fitzgerald, in her American film debut, does a wondrous job with the part of Ann: a beautifully etched supporting performance. As Michael O'Leary, Humphrey Bogart is unfortunately inept in the Irish brogue department (why couldn't they have simply cut out the accent?) and George Brent is adequately wooden as Dr. Frederick Steele whom Judy marries. Davis slams through a gooey collection of cliches in her nerviest style during the early segments but her metamorphasis into a vibrantly humbled married woman is quite a striking contrast to the selfishly brazen spoiled heiress: truly a multi-faceted performance. Ronald Reagan gets to play Alec, one of Judy's drunken swains, and Cora Witherspoon is memorable as the snotty Carrie. The last twenty minutes of the film are expertly crafted and timelessly tear-jerking: the movie sold more kleenex than any other of its day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Introduction to Golden Era Davis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I had not seen any Bette Davis films from her Hollywood golden era I decided to have a marathon and get caught up with this actress. I was very lucky to have chosen this film as the first to watch because although it begins with her playing her "Bette Davis" icon (which I find off-putting), her portrayal of the character had a wider range than I expected and it made me reassess my attitude towards her. I found myself really getting involved. The story of a self-centered woman who is diagnosed with an incurable disease is the ultimate soap opera, but this one has some twists that I did not see coming. Early on, when Davis walks around the set, giving a line reading here, then another there - you know she's meeting every preplanned stage mark - and you can tell it's been rehearsed to death. She comes across as being in charge, but it was what I expected from Davis, and it's probably the Bette Davis the audience came to see back in 1939 - Davis the movie star. However, the story threw me for a loop. Davis really did show me she had a side to her that I had not seen in her films up until this one. Claude Rains is also very enjoyable and effective in a secondary role. He shows up in a number of other Davis films. And the last luminous shot of Davis in "Dark Victory" is every bit as powerful as Garbo's final close up at the end of "Queen Christina." This film is worth checking out for sure and a good introduction to Golden Era Davis if you haven't seen any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...Ms. Davis at her beautiful best. I'm so glad it was turned-down by Garbo, because she certainly couldn't say anything but "I vont to be alone". Gorgeous, yes - but, actresses are more than beauty."Dark Victory" was filmed at the height of Bette's early career, and she certainly was BETTE DAVIS in it. She hit every emotion in this movie, and made every scene shine, as she went from wealthy bon vivant to frightened young lady to happy-again wife, to the realization her death was at hand, and her final scene. George Brent (her brain-surgeon), Humphrey Bogart (???) her horse-trainer, Geraldine Fitzgerald (well-played role of best friend) and a very handsome Ronald Reagan (drunken playboy) were only a part of the settings, because - whether she was good or bad - no other player could even stand close to her and gain attentionAlthough Orson Welles let everyone know he THOUGHT he was the greatest at everything, and completely ruined almost everything he did, Ms. Davis KNEW she was the best, because she gave it to every role. Melodrama and/or "soap", let someone else try to do it......several others tried to do that role, but were disasters. The only other actress I feel could do Traherne would be Meryl Streep, if someone had only thought of her."Melanie" stole the Oscar that year because of "Gone with the Wind" and the epic grandness of that film, PLUS COLOR !! Ms. Davis also tested for that movie. The only actor I thought was miscast in "Dark Victory" was Bogart - but, he was on the payroll.So, rather than comment that it's a little dated or the movie is older than the viewer, why not just marvel at the talent Ms. Davis possessed, and admit no one else could do her caliber of work. Shame on you if you don't own this movie. Watch it alone, because it is too personal to share. Kudos to all - I rate it at 50.......</fullReview>

What could have been a maudlin, depressing howler is actually quite moving. Bette Davis gives a superb performance--when she realizes she's dying, she doesn't turn into a weak, whiny victim...she becomes strong and self-reliant. Also Geraldine Fitzgerald turns in a great performance as her best friend--her and Davis worked well together. Great script, beautiful Max Steiner score and well-directed. Only two complaints--George Brent gives out a lousy performance as the doctor and Humphrey Bogart is uproariously miscast as an Irish horse trainer. That aside, top-notch all the way.

		<fullReview>Bette Davis' personal favorite amongst her films this lovely picture is kept from slipping into melodrama too deeply by her insightful work. True she gets her big flashy moments but it is her quiet simple ones that score the most with the viewer in their understated simplicity. A flop on stage for Tallulah Bankhead this has what that didn't in the character of the faithful friend Ann, played beautifully by Geraldine Fitzgerald, who can rail at the fates so Bette's character Judy doesn't have to bemoan her troubles and seem a self pitying crybaby. Instead she is a life loving dynamo caught in a tragic situation who meets the challenge and finds peace. George Brent is adequate, as always, but even a stronger leading man would have been put in the shade by Bette here in what is one of her best if not the best performance in a career filled with so many. Reagan, an actor of limited skill, is the most relaxed and likable he would ever be on screen. Humphrey Bogart's Irish stable hand isn't quite the blight on a work of art that he himself considered it but there is not question that he is miscast and he sticks out like a sore thumb. A wonderful film with an ending that is wrenching and deeply beautiful at the same time.</fullReview>

However, after falling off her horse and down the stairway, Ms. Davis' family physician arranges for her to visit brain specialist George Brent (as Frederick Steele). Her self-described "reasonable quantity" of tobacco and alcohol does not seem to be a factor in Davis' declining health. Dr. Brent finds Davis in dire straits and operates on her brain almost immediately. The two fall in love, also...Davis seems to recover, but finds a file describing her condition as "prognosis negative." She asks, "What does prognosis mean?" and "What does negative mean?" Really...This film confirmed Davis as a box office favorite; she was listed in the annual top ten "Quigley Poll" for the first time, in sixth place. Davis' performance was in the running for year's best, behind "Academy Award" winner Vivien Leigh ("Gone with the Wind") and "New York Film Critics" runner-up Greta Garbo ("Ninotchka"). "Dark Victory" is a marvelous movie star performance vehicle, but less of a film. Davis receives great support from Brent and especially Geraldine Fitzgerald (as Ann King). Irish-accented Humphrey Bogart (as Michael O'Leary) is amusing.******** Dark Victory (4/20/39) Edmund Goulding ~ Bette Davis, George Brent, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Humphrey Bogart</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edmund Goulding directs Bette Davis again (remember their very good cooperation in "That Certain Woman"), a melodrama again, though this time without a happy ending.Bette plays Judith Traherne. Young woman, just in her early twenties. Judith uses her life and does not think about death. She is wealthy, easy-going, outspoken, and attractive. After an accident she is diagnosed as being mortally ill. Her life changes drastically.Well, let's be honest-this story is not a very original one. And without the delicate and smart direction of Goulding or moving performances would be quite ridiculous and hardly remembered.The reason why I like this movie is not because I love ALL romances without any exception. I don't like naive and unbelievable stories told without any charm. And this one has a melancholy and a charm included.Bette Davis gives one of her very good performances. She plays the rebel Judith. Judith is a rebel during the whole story of hers we know. But her being rebel changes. In the very beginning she rebels against the rules. It's just a fun, being individualistic. What other can she do? She has money and men, she thinks she doesn't not need anything more. And then, after realizing she's mortally ill, Judith changes. Her being rebel is dramatic, moving, devastating. She fights hard and does not give up, though just after reading the papers of Dr. Steele she decides to live without any rules, just wait for death miserable. The scene when she meets Ann and the doctor, who's her fiancé then, knowing everything, and being so nervous, is terrific. Bette showed her real talent. Also the final scene, when she discovers that she's leaving the world right now, is a real mastery by Davis.I would also mention the supporting powerful appearance of Geraldine Fitzgerald. The same year she played her Oscar-nominated part of Isabella in "Wuthering Heights", again moving and smart.</fullReview>

Well, yeah, that was a spectacular film and all, but let's not forget that year's other big picture, Bette Davis' weeper "Dark Victory". Overshadowed by all the hoopla surrounding "GWTW", "Dark Victory" is a wonderful "little" picture with a role that Davis really got a chance to sink her teeth into. She plays rich, spoiled socialite Judith Traherne who whiles away her days drinking, partying, and riding horses. Soon, though, her carefree life turns tragic when she's diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. She begins to focus on living her life to the fullest, including falling in love with her doctor(the bland George Brent). Ronald Reagan has a bit part as Judy's friend and Humphrey Bogart horribly plays an Irish horse trainer(serious miscasting). Nonetheless, this is a moving sudser with Davis in a brave role.

		<shortDescription>Victorious in spirit - DVD transfer still a tad shaky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1939 Bette Davis was at the peak of her powers as a professional actress. After an initially rocky start to her career, Davis proved the old adage that "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again." Aside from being one of Hollywood's highest paid actresses, she also had Jack Warner eating out of the palm of her hand. And although Davis and Warner often butted heads over projects and script approval, on these occasions Warner was usually the one to acquiesce."Dark Victory" (1939) was just such a project in which Warner and Davis didn't see eye to eye. In fact, after an early consultation, Warner was rumored to have said, "Who the hell wants to see a story about a girl with a brain tumor?" Apparently, a lot of people did. On its initial release "Dark Victory" was a box office dynamo, elevating the level of prestige for both Davis and the studio and earning the actress her second Best Actress Oscar nomination (Davis lost to Vivien Leigh, as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With The Wind)."Dark Victory" is the story of haughty and exclusive socialite, Judith Traherne (Davis). She's generally devil-may-care. However, lately Judy's been seeing double ? literally. She confides the deteriorating state of health to her best friend and personal secretary ? Ann King (Geraldine Fitzgerald). Unbeknownst to Judith, Ann tells family doctor and personal friend, Parsons (Henry Travers) of Judy's condition. Together, the two suckle the reluctant Judy into a professional consultation with Dr. Fredrick Steele (George Brent). Steele's initial diagnosis of a brain tumor is complicated by a growing affection for his patient. When he operates on Judy, only to discover that her case is both rare and terminal ? he and Ann concoct an elaborate lie to protect Judith from the truth. But this is a secret that will not stay buried.All around the acting in this finely wrought melodrama from director, Edmund Goulding is first rate. Davis has never been more poignant, tragic, sympathetic and understanding. Her performance throbs with an equilibrium of finely crafted emotions. As her sympathetic physician/turned lover, George Brent delivers an understated tour de force. The other outstanding bit of acting that deserves mention herein is Geraldine Fitzgerald's brilliant bit as Judy's most loyal companion. As Ann, Fitzgerald generates a level of sincerity that is so unique and mesmerizing, it's a shock and a wonder she didn't have a more prolific acting career after this film. Humphrey Bogart, in an early appearance as Michael O'Leery, makes a rather unconvincing, if embittered, Irish stable hand. But Ronald Reagan is quite engaging as Judy's loyal, if alcoholic, friend, Alec Hamm.After years of having to contend with downright shoddy transfers of this classic weepy, Warner Brothers has gone back to the drawing board and come up with a better transfer on this newly restored and remastered DVD. The black in white image is - not perfect - but a definite improvement. Though age related artifacts persist, these have been greatly reduced from previous transfers. There is no edge enhancement for a picture that is smooth, yet sharp and most pleasing on the eyes. The gray scale exhibits an amazing amount of fine detail throughout with deep solid blacks and very clean whites. Truly, there is nothing that will disappoint on this occasion. The audio has been nicely cleaned up. It's mono, as originally recorded, but presented without the nuisance of pops and hiss that accompanied previous incarnations of this film on home video. A new audio commentary and production featurette augment your viewing experience. So break out a fresh box of Kleenex. "Dark Victory" is at last worthy of all of your tears on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Offering good drama and a choice role for Bette Davis's talents, "Dark Victory" makes very good use of the familiar story idea of the dying heroine. While a bare outline of the story on paper would probably sound rather predictable and routine, Davis and her supporting cast are able to give it depth and believability.The role of Judith was particularly suited to Davis, as the character goes through several changes, and also sometimes shows one side on the surface and quite a different side to herself. Davis gives the role her all, making each scene count without quite pushing it too far, and getting even better as the story proceeds. She might not quite hit the perfect balance as she did in "All About Eve" or her other very best performances, but she gives you a character to remember, and she handles the role in a way that present-day actresses could hardly hope to match.The supporting cast get much simpler characters, yet they help out quite a bit. Geraldine Fitzgerald is believable as Judith's friend, and George Brent does a good job in a role that, while almost a stock character, is important to the story. There is some interesting casting in the roles for Humphrey Bogart and Ronald Reagan, yet they work well enough. The screenplay keeps it simple, letting the characters and the cast do most of the work, instead of resorting to the kind of sensationalistic or pretentious turns that are too often used in this kind of story.Overall, it's a worthwhile drama that also allows you to see one of cinema's finest dramatic performers in a role that gives her a lot of material to work with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical weepie if ever I saw one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typical but classic 'weepie' (or 'women's film') from the late Thirties, a star vehicle for Bette Davis who was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance but didn't win (no matter, since she was Oscar-nominated a whopping eleven times in total and took home two such trophies during her career). Davis portrays a young wealthy woman who enjoys life in a frivolous manner, drinking, smoking and sporting too much, until she is diagnosed with a terminal illness that will kill her within a year. Instead of crying over it (which is left to the audience), she chooses to concentrate on the important things in life, finds love with the doctor examining her and keeps her dignity until the very (bitter) end, thus going out in a 'dark victory' in her acceptance of the inevitable as she embraces her death instead of needlessly living in fear for the unavoidable for the remainder of her days. The final scenes in which she says goodbye to her new husband as he leaves for a business trip while she, unknown to him, is in the final stages of her physical collapse ? in order for him to remember her as she wants him to ? is a serious tearjerking moment like only the Thirties could provide; hence the genre nickname 'weepies'. Despite the emphatically tragic occurrences and strong performances making it feel compelling, the general level of melodrama is overly high for many (male) audience members, which is a reason films like these were mainly marketed to the female spectators. Co-starring Humprey Bogart in a pre-Casablanca role, not as a bad guy in this case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bette Davis is superb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie because it avoids sentimentality and because of the performance by Bette Davis in what has to be one of the best roles of her career. Ms. Davis completely dominates the movie and because of her the movie avoids becoming hokey or corny. Her performance is superb and she carries the movie. The story itself is strong and compelling and deals candidly with many sensitive themes. The plot is highly dramatic but avoids becoming melodramatic as Ms. Davis' character, Judith, struggles to come to terms with serious issues relating to life and death. The movie is filmed in a film-noir style that predates the emergence of that genre by several years. George Brent and Geraldine Fitzgerald are also give wonderful performances in supporting roles, and they are supportive roles because this film has one star and that star is Bette Davis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a melodramatic genre emblematic film of the classic stage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film b/w, by Edmund Goulding. Based on a play by George E. Breweer Bertramn Jr. and Bloch, whose rights acquired by Warner at the request of Bette Davis. It was filmed in San Fernando Valley (LA) and Warner Studios (Burbank). It premiered on 22-IV-1939. Was the subject of a "remake" mediocre, "Stolen Hours" (1963), starring Susan Hayward.The action takes place in Long Island (NY) and a country house in Vermont, a town near Boston, during nearly a year in 1938/39. It tells the story of Judith Traherne (Bette Davis), rich and graceful, 23, fond of parties and racehorses, independent and willful character. Ill, was put into the hands of the neurosurgeon Frederick Steele (George Brent), who falls in love. Despite the poor prognosis of the disease, get married and move to Vermont, where it drains the possibilities of happiness, as he investigates the healing of brain tumors.The film tells a love with no future between a neurosurgeon and a rich girl, happy and jovial, operated for a brain tumour, aware of the approaching end. Judith cheerfully uses every means at her disposal to share with joy the time available to her husband and her best friend and secretary, Ann King (Geraldine Fitzgerald). The possibility of facing imminent death fighting spirit, presence of mind and betting in favor of not giving up too soon, is the center of the story. Life is worth so worth it that we must seize it intensely and relentlessly until the last moment.. We must help to support strong will, so Judith changes the hustle and the shallowness of the holidays with friends, the environment of tranquility and contact with the nature of the house in Vermont.The film is an atypical work within the Hollywood production time for its theme and outcome. It sets a superb celebration of the strength of a tough and lucid woman.Music by Max Steiner, reinforces the moments of joy, surprise, disappointment, despair and determination. Photography by Ernest Haller ("Jezebel", 1938), is clear and bright, moderate gray combined with intensely dark contrasts, always accompanied by white francs (shirt, scarf, walls, etc..). It benefits from excellent lighting. The script focuses on Judith's story, which retains a slight taste of theater. The interpretation of Bette Davis is one of the best of her career. we highlight the presence of H. Bogart and R. Reagan. Its director Edmund Goulding created with skill and discretion, a poignant and heartfelt work."Dark Victory" is a melodramatic genre emblematic film of the classic stage, which was a huge commercial success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Here, we don't have anything--and yet we have everything...haven't we?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see why Bette Davis admired "Dark Victory" more so than any of her other star-vehicles--her Judith Traherne is the quintessential Bette Davis character: smart, sassy, nervously gay, a drinking pal to the guys and a best buddy to the girls. Traherne is without malice, a real chum, and Davis plays her with fluttery vitriol and upper-crust glee. A Long Island society girl, ailing but still strong, falls wildly in love with her doctor...but how can he tell her that she has very little time left to live? The supporting cast is made up of some odd personalities: Geraldine Fitzgerald's dedicated girlfriend seems to have no life outside of Judith's world (and performs her gal-pal duties with a curious severity); Humphrey Bogart is an Irish stable-hand with a secret crush on Judith (she's tempted, but ultimately conveys to him the old 'don't touch' message); Ronald Reagan is a country club type, always in a tuxedo and at the bar; George Brent is the brilliant surgeon who loves Judith (but he's faster with his fists than he is with words). Based on a play by George Emerson Brewer, Jr. and Bertram Bloch (which had starred Tallulah Bankhead), this Warner Bros. weeper is glossy and flossy, a dithering, overstated and swooningly romantic mini-epic for masochists. In other words, the archetypal Bette Davis film. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turning the common tear-jerker into something special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This box-office bonanza confirmed Bette Davis's status as the most critically and financially successful star of her day, who like her slight look-alike Meryl Streep, could do no wrong with two Oscars under her purse. Davis was almost assured a third Oscar for this (until a little film called "Gone With the Wind" came along late in the year with a ravishing British woman named Vivien Leigh swiping it away) but entered film immortality that year anyway with an additional three classics to her credit.As the lively socialite Judith Traherne, Davis is the most popular member of her social circle, alternately loved, loathed and lusted after for her striking independence. But fate has a tricky way of stepping in, and before she knows it, a visit to the doctor's after a fall from a horse leads to the revelation of her own immortality being threatened, something a spitfire like her is in fury of having to face with the deck of cards stacked against her.She is supported by the loyal George Brent as the brutally honest doctor who treats her and two uniquely different men-Humphrey Bogart as the lusty stableman secretly in love with her, and "Little Ronnie Reagan" (as Davis herself would call him when he entered a certain sector called politics) is her socially alike boyfriend but totally different in spirit. He gives a performance so sexless that you can't believe for a minute that she'd have an eye on him. It is the Heathcliff like Bogart who is much more her match, filled with fire to match her own sexuality, if not equal to her socially. Their scene when he reveals his feelings to her is an attempted seduction that under different circumstances would rock the stables he works in. More intuned to her both romantically and socially is Brent, giving one of his best performances. Also noteworthy is Geraldine Fitzgerald as Davis's loyal secretary and confidante who stands by her through thick and thin.The real treat is seeing Davis grow from devil may care socialite to a lovely but ultimately doomed young lady. Yes, there are tons of clichés, but Davis helps the film rise above each and every one of them. In the end, what this film is about is rising above one's own mortality and facing death with dignity, which she does beautifully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood always recognises a good tear-jerker when it sees one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is strange how an unsuccessful play can sometimes be turned into a highly successful film. The best-known example is probably "Casablanca" which is generally regarded as one of the great classics of the American cinema, even though nobody would consider its original source, "Everybody Comes to Rick's", one of the great classics of the American theatre. (Indeed, the play has never been published and was first performed as recently as 1991).Similarly, the original stage version of "Dark Victory" only ran for a few weeks on Broadway, but Hollywood always recognises a good tear-jerking story when it sees one, and quickly snapped up the film rights. The plot is essentially that of "La Traviata" or, for that matter, that of "Love Story", which is perhaps the most famous cinematic treatment of this theme in recent decades, although it is far from being the only one. Indeed, in recent years terminal illness has become a stock cliché, the starting-point of all those "disease of the month" TV movies. In the thirties, however, the theme was perhaps rather more original than it would be today.The plot can be summarised as boy meets girl, boy marries girl, girl dies tragically but bravely of some fatal condition. The girl in this case is Judith Traherne, a spoilt, hedonistic socialite whose main interests in life are party-going and horse riding. The boy is Frederick Steele, the brilliant surgeon who operates on her when she is diagnosed with a brain tumour. The tumour, in fact, proves to be incurable, but Steele, who has fallen in love with his patient, pretends to her that the operation has been a success to allow them a short period of happiness together. A crisis, however, comes when Judith discovers that Steele has lied to her. The title is taken from a speech in which Judith declares that if she can face death with courage this will represent a "victory over the dark".It is said that Bette Davis considered this her best performance, although I would respectfully disagree; I found her better in some of her other films from around this period, such as "Jezebel" or "The Letter". She is, however, by far the best thing about this film, and succeeds in lifting it above the level of the run-of-the-mill weepie it could so easily have been. She was not the most naturalistic of actors, but her very theatrical style of acting, characterised by heightened emotions, fitted in well with the "filmed theatre" style of film-making which prevailed at this time, and she must be regarded as one of the leading screen actresses of the thirties and forties. (Whether her style of acting would fit in with modern styles of film-making is another matter altogether). The character of Judith goes through considerable development in the course of the film, from the spoilt little rich girl of the opening scenes to the strong, courageous, dignified woman of the later ones, so Davis was required to call on a considerable range of emotions.None of the other actors are as good as Davis. I was surprised to see a screen legend like Humphrey Bogart cast in the minor role of Michael, Judith's Irish groom who is secretly in love with her, especially as Bogart makes a hopeless attempt at an Irish accent. The role of Steele is a rather thankless one as he is less a character than an idealised archetype of the noble, idealistic doctor, and George Brent's performance is a rather stolid one. He does not bring much passion to the role, even though he and Davis were lovers in real life at the time they made this film. It might have been better if these two actors had switched roles; Brent, an Irishman by birth, would have had no problems with the accent, and Bogart might have made Dr Steele a more interesting figure.I must confess that tear-jerkers are not always my favourite movie genre; my view of "Love Story" is similar to Oscar Wilde's view of Dickens' "Old Curiosity Shop"- a man must have a heart of stone to be able to watch it without laughing. "Dark Victory" is a rather better film than "Love Story", although it does have its weaknesses. Nevertheless, I am surprised that it was nominated for an Oscar in 1939, a year which is sometimes regarded as the best in Hollywood's history, when some much better films, such as "Dodge City", missed out. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of Bette Davis' greatest performances. It completely runs the gamut of all emotions. I also mention this movie to people who tell me that Bette Davis was the ugliest woman in Hollywood (!) With this move and Now, Voyager (1942) I make the claim that she was one of the most attractive women in Hollywood. Judith Traherne (Davis), a 23 yr old orphan socialite (Davis was 30 at the time!) lives a life of horses, parties and the social whirl of the New England horsey set. Sge has been suffering from severe headaches, so her friend and secretary, Anne (a marvelous performance by Geraldine Fitzgerald) works behind her back to get her to be seen by a eminent brain surgeon, Dr. Steele (George Brent). Doctor Steele determines that she has a brain tumor and operates to remove it. Afterwards, he discovers that the tumor will return and take her life. Meanwhile, Judith's feelings for Dr Steele have turned to love and he returns those feelings. However, Judith happens to come upon her chart in Dr Steele's office and discovers her prognosis is negative, which leads to a wonderfully written scene in a restaurant where Judith acts up and tells Dr Steele what she thinks of him and walks out. Gradually Dr Steele makes her realize that her death is just another stage in her life and that she can have a happy life with Steele and meet her death "beautifully and finally". The death scene is well acted, but the wonderful Max Steiner score does intrude somewhat. A beautifully acted and well written movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Check your belief at the door...7/10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a thought, or a notion, that if a movie was made during the 'golden age' of film, or that if a movie has been nominated for an Academy Award, that it somehow should stand above reproach. Well, 'Dark Victory' expands on this premise by going so far as to add a third dimension to this belief system: Not only was it made in the gargantuan holy movie year of 1939, not only did it flag down nominations for Best Picture and Best Actress, it can also boast of starring two of Hollywood's biggest and most respected actors, Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart. This movie has to be beyond reproach, right? Uh, not on your Long Island socialite life!With an exception granted to Bette Davis as Judith Traherne (the Long Island socialite), I believe that not one of the other lead actors involved in this movie did a very good job. Humphrey Bogart (Michael O'Leary) would have been passable as the horse trainer if only the director (Edmund Goulding) would have changed Bogart's character name to Michael Smith instead of Michael O'Leary. Listening to Bogart approximate an Irish accent is like listening to Count Chocula trying to sell Lucky Charms. As if Bogart's Irish accent wasn't license enough for backwards laughter, his first scene in the movie shows him hitching a ride by jumping aboard Davis' moving car. In a scene that is obviously shot in front of a filmed screen, the background film shakes up and down as Bogart stands on the foot railing of the car, the very picture of a statuesque performer amid a rocky road. Bogart has at least one redeemable scene in the movie, and that takes place more than half way through the movie while both he and Davis are in the horse stables. This is where Bogart 'tries to make love' with Bette Davis. However, this scene quickly dissolves away from Bogart to become another stand out scene for Davis. Davis first turns down his subtle advances gracefully as she turns off the soft music that Bogart had just switched on only a moment before. Then another moment later, she thwarts off his advance not so gracefully as she informs him that she's a dead woman walking and that he's just wasting his time confessing his love for her.As bad as Bogart is in this movie, at least he isn't boring or bland. No, that description is better suited for George Brent as Dr. Fredrick Steele. Brent looks the part as the solid immovable object to Davis' irresistible force. About the only time one can sense any life behind his 'Doctor' veneer is when he's joking about 'microbial bugs invading his sandwiches'. Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Davis' best friend Ann King. She spends most of her time as the only person (besides the good doctor) who knows of Davis' assured death sentence. This knowledge means that she is allowed to be angry in the movie periodically with Brent for his method of maintaining a sense of denial for the good of Davis. Her sacrifice demands that she must also continue lying to her best friend up through to the last moments of Davis' life. When she's not lying to Davis, she's crying into a hanky (along with the theater goers of 1939, no doubt). Her payoff for such a sacrifice comes in the form of a spoken will by Davis. Davis wills her husband to Fitzgerald and asks her to promise to live with the Doctor after Davis has died to help the Doctor find cures for diseases, be a good wife and to bring him sandwiches. Of course Fitzgerald's character does so willingly while crying?such a friend, such a sacrifice.Which brings us to Ronald Reagan (Alec Hamm). Reagan acts drunk throughout most of the film, perhaps a precursor to the bumbling, forgetful 'arms to the contras' President he was destined to become. Reagan doesn't add much to the film as the wannabe boy 'that got away', that actually never does go away, from Davis. I don't know who is worse for wear: Bogart as the Irishman, or Reagan as the drunk. Let's say that Foster Brooks never worried too much about Reagan stealing his act.However, it's not all doom and gloom and bad acting, there are enough scenes in the movie that do make watching it worthwhile. The climactic scene at the restaurant where Davis orders a 'Prognosis Negative' is certainly a highlight. I also enjoy watching Bette Davis light up a cigarette, or to hear her dish out line after line with her amphetamine laced tongue. She's usually the best part of any movie she takes part in. It's just that the rest of the cast were so very, very weak.I may be rating the movie a notch higher than I should, but sometimes I enjoy bad acting and an implausible situation. All things considered it still rates a 7/10.Clark Richards</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bette Davis' Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another celebrated Bette Davis melodrama, this time ending in more than tears. Her own work, as usual, carries a film with yet another fantastical, sentimental plot, although this time she has to pick up more slack than usual with some miscast support and underpowered playing by some of the other supporting actors. George Brent, for example can't match, say Paul Heinreid or especially Claude Rains in the gravitas stakes, and there seems a lack of passion between Davis and him in their love scenes (strange when you consider the rumours of an off-set romance). Geraldine Fitzgerald barely registers as a cipher for Davis' caprices, although Ronald Reagan does a nice turn as a friendly souse, almost a prototype real-life Dean Martin 20 years before his time. Worst of all is the great Bogie looking ridiculous in jodhpurs and spouting the worst "Oirish" accent this side of the Irish Sea (when he can be bothered). But yet again, the finale makes up for much that has gone before, especially the scene in the sunny daylight when Davis realises her time has come. Okay, cue massed violins and choirs from Max Steiner as she packs off new husband Brent and retires to expire in her bed, but Davis herself acts the scene with dignity and restraint, a nice contrast with her staccato energetic careering through the first half of the film prior to learning the extent of her illness. It would be easy to categorise all these doomed heroine roles Davis plays as extensions of her self but I prefer to see and admire the subtle variations in each performance. Less mannered than her great contemporary Katharine Hepburn and with more star quality than her bitter rival Joan Crawford, she was the real deal at least until the mid 40's when her looks started to fade and the new realist style, with the burgeoning Actor's School Method, was starting to emerge and at the same time dismantle the old Hollywood Studio system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performance from Davis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Victory (1939) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Warner tear-jerker about a socialite (Bette Davis) who falls in love with her surgeon (George Brent) not knowing that she's dying from a brain tumor. When the young woman learns her fate it's up to her to try and come to terms with facing death. It was funny to read that Jack Warner didn't want to buy the rights to this film because he felt it was do horrible at the box office. You can't help but understand his position but the power of Davis certainly drew crowds into the theater way back when this was first released and her power will continue to draw people to this film. Her performance here is without question the best I've seen from her to date and one can't picture anyone else in this role. This is a fairly dark movie but she brings so much to her character that you can't help but be amazed at how well she handles all the ups and downs. There are three great sequences in this film, which make it a classic. The first happens early on when Davis first meets Brent and tries to hide her illness. The second, and perhaps most famous one, is when she learns that the doctor and her sister (Geraldine Fitzgerald) have been lying to her and orders some "prognosis negative". Third, is the wonderful, well drawn out ending that really packs a nice little punch because, once again, how much Davis brings to the situation. The performance by Davis is top-notch but she's equaled by Brent who also turns in perhaps the best performance I've seen from him. The strength he brings the character was masterful. Fitzgerald is also good in her role as is Henry Travers as the family doctor. Ronald Reagan doesn't fair as good and this is easy to spot during a scene where he's sitting by Davis and is suppose to be drunk. Humphrey Bogart is completely wrong in his role as an Irishman as his accent is going in and out throughout the entire film. He really comes off looking pretty bad here but you have to admire him for at least trying. DARK VICTORY is bound to draw new fans each passing year as it gets a showing on TCM every few months but you can certainly understand as this is the type of film that one could show to a newbie and make them understand the power of older films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the grand demise, cigarette and cocktail in hand...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can just imagine a young Ross Hunter sitting in a darkened movie palace in 1939, basking in the glow of the projector's light , watching DARK VICTORY unfold on the big screen.This Warner Brothers melodrama , a star vehicle for Bette Davis , no doubt highly influenced the enterprising nineteen year old future film producer who dominated the Nineteen Fifties and Sixties with lavish tearjerkers such as "Magnificent Obsession" and "Imitation of Life", among others.Movie soap operas have always been a sturdy Hollywood staple. Hugely popular , they have a direct trajectory to audiences' hearts, no matter how illogical and ridiculous the proceedings are. It's not my purpose to denigrate these movies as pure trash ; they are products of their time and serve a definite function as pure escapist entertainment. Many of them are extremely well made and very enjoyable. Some,like DARK VICTORY, give a great star an indelible moment to once again shine in the Hollywood firmament. Those old black and white shadows of a still young Bette Davis gracing the screen show a star at the height of her powers. Was she a great actress? You certainly can't take your eyes off her. That clipped way of talking, the shifting of the eyes, the very determined walk held Davis in good stead for nearly sixty years. She could look beautiful, she could look plain, all in a matter of minutes in the same movie. She smoked a cigarette and held a cocktail as if they were the greatest props ever invented. She infuses this hoary old chestnut with so much conviction that she picks the movie up by its dated bootstraps and commands your attention.The story of a wealthy heiress of a Long Island thoroughbred farm who discovers she is dying of a brain tumor is chock full of laughable moments. This was not so in 1939 when the film premiered. In hindsight, one can't help but watch this movie with a rueful eye, realizing how much society and culture has changed in over half a century. Some motion pictures remain classics no matter how much time has passed ; this is not one of them. But no matter : when Bette ascends that final staircase accompanied by Max Steiner's angelic choir, you're with her all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Melodrama with the Star at the Height of her Powers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In truth DARK VICTORY has a soggy story of the impending death of Judith Traherne (Bette Davis), an energetic socialite diagnosed with an incurable brain disease. Nor is the film helped by a wooden performance from costar George Brent, who seems more worried about stealing Davis's limelight rather than creating a coherent portrait of a hotshot surgeon falling in love with his patient.On the other hand viewers have much to savor in Davis's performance. She begins the film full of nervous energy, as she desperately tries to prove to herself and her friends that she is perfectly healthy apart from occasional headaches. Her movements are abrupt, almost bird- like as she moves across the frame, unable to keep still for one moment.It is only when Dr. Steele (Brent) takes her under his medical wing that her condition improves. She becomes almost childlike as she willingly agrees to have her nerves tested. The doctor taps her knees and her elbows and she laughs girlishly, almost as if such treatment was not something she had experienced for a long time.In the film's third movement, once she discovers her true condition, Davis resembles a galleon in full sail. Her drunk sequence in an upmarket restaurant reminds us of her memorable performance as Margo Channing in ALL ABOUT EVE: no one, not least Dr. Steele and her best friend Ann (Geraldine Fitzgerald) can stand in her way.At length, however, Judith comes to accept her fate and enjoy her last days in peace. She marries Steele, and the two of them decamp to Vermont where she enjoys cultivating her garden and acting the part of an embryonic homemaker. The end, when it strikes, is sudden: Judith clasps her hands to her head and moves slowly up to her bedroom where she lies on the bed and awaits death to the accompaniment of heavenly choirs. Davis's face becomes still, almost beatific; a testament to her versatility as a screen performer.Beside her performance, no one really has much of a chance. Fitzgerald carries off the thankless role of the best friend with aplomb, while Humphrey Bogart (in one of his last supporting roles before stardom beckoned) makes a passionate stable-hand. But DARK VICTORY is very much Davis's picture, and she takes her opportunity to dominate our attention with both hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE DARK VICTORY is good romantic drama, which unfolds in a very sensitive spiritual dimension. Essentially, this is the victory of the soul over the body. Of course, this description is sketchy. Bette Davis is incredible.Judith Traherne (Bette Davis) is a young woman full of life, which is suffering from a malignant tumor. The path of incomprehension and rejection through sorrow and love to know and reconciliation is perfectly described. Bette Davis is masterfully put forward role. She had the support of the rest of the excellent team led by George Brent as Dr. Frederick Steele, Geraldine Fitzgerald as Ann King and Humphrey Bogart as Michael O'Leary.Dark Victory is literally a film about the victory, the only real and true victory, perhaps the most important elemental things of the essence - and this is the victory of man over the fear of death. Director and story are pretty sloppy for such deep topics. It is very positive that this movie at its peak celebrates life. The courage and inner strength of spirit that is nurtured by love, endless energy and youthful freshness</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good film, but it couldn't compete in 1939; you'll probably cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of best male actor of all time, for me it's a tie between Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant. For best female actor, no question in my mind -- Bette Davis. And her talents are well displayed in this, which was said to be her favorite film.I want to start out by saying that if you already have the DVD, I don't recommend updating to the Blu Ray version. I'm not sure there's significant improvement.This film is another of the famous pairings of Bette Davis and George Brent. I actually think this is one of the better ones because there's more of a story to Brent's character here than sometimes occurred. He's a doctor with some expertise in brain problems, who is about to go off on medical research. He is persuaded to postpone his trip to look after Bette Davis' spoiled rich girl character, who is having symptoms of dizziness, headaches, and double vision. Early in the film it's almost impossible to have much sympathy for her character. But, we also know that some of her impertinent behavior is a result of her fear. My sympathy for the character began when she received the diagnosis -- I've been there, done that, although in my case both times it was good news...which was not expected. But the fear was immense while waiting for the prognosis.There are several supporting actors worth mentioning. Geraldine Fitzgerald is very good as the best friend. Humphrey Bogart has an odd role as a stable man with an Irish accent. The role is often criticized, but this was back when he was still a supporting actor; he was paying his dues to the studio here. Ronald Reagan has a nothing role as a slightly tipsy friend; I can't believe it helped his career. Henry Travers is good (as always) as the country doctor who persuades George Brent to take Davis' case.A major portion of the film is the love conquers all stuff...although, of course, in this case it doesn't. But it is a good example of how people can sometimes fool themselves about the future.The death scene in remarkably well done from an emotional standpoint. In my view, one of the great moments in film.The one part of the film that just doesn't work for me is Humphrey Bogart's main scene. To me it just doesn't work. Not because of the character's Irish accent, but just because it seems inane. I think the problem with the scene is that the groundwork of it is not laid, and then Bogart tries to seduce Davis, not knowing that she is dying. I think it's the one significant flaw in the film. Well, other than Ronald Reagan's empty performance.One of the bonuses on the Blu Ray edition is a short documentary sort of lamenting that this film, or Bette's performance did not win the Academy Award. However, the year was 1939, the year often considered the year that the finest films in Hollywood's history were made, including "Gone With The Wind". "Dark Victory" is a wonderful film and Bette Davis' performance is memorable. But neither the film nor the performance could complete with "GWTW" or "The Wizard Of Oz", or several others.Even despite the fact that Davis is my favorite actress, this film was very memorable to me. When I decided to upgrade to Blu Ray (a waste), I delayed ordering this film because I was expecting a bad diagnosis, It was only after the green light that I had the nerve to order the film. The death scene is that memorable.</fullReview>

Ronald Reagan, Henry Travers, and Humphrey Bogart play third fiddle here to Davis and George Brent (as Doc Fred). Betty's "Judy Traherne" character is a definite One Per Center. DARK VICTORY's main theme is that even the 1% die, one time each, just like we 99%. How sad. In her 23 or 24 years on this Earth, Judy drinks and smokes enough for any two centenarians. She gets her pick of brain surgeon, halfback, or Captain Queeg, and naturally pairs off with the first mentioned. For his part, after fiddling around with Judy's Gray Matter, Fred concludes, "What's not to like?" As Judy declares towards her end, she's "the lucky one." While everyone else is concerned with cooking meals, paying bills, training horses, and curing brain cancer, Judy's seven daily chores on behalf of the One Per Cent are horses, dogs, shooting, yachting, travel, parties, and gossip. Since many of these activities are not becoming for folks pushing 25, Judy's timing is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judith Traherne (Bette Davis) is a self-absorbed socialite who dabbles in horses. When a surgeon (George Brent) discovers she has inoperable cancer, he opts not to tell her. Judith and the doctor fall in love and plan to marry, but his secret weighs heavily on his heart.This movie was a huge hit in 1939 and became the basis for countless clichéd, dying-but-brave-heroine stories. Davis is excellent as she evolves from snooty brat to sensitive wife and oozes screen charisma. The same cannot be said, unfortunately, for her costars: Brent is dull and lifeless and the two share no romantic chemistry, Humphrey Bogart is miscast as a humble, Irish stableman, and a boyish Ronald Reagan looks out of place as a rich playboy.Courage in the face of impending doom is a heart-tugging theme and Bette is superb, but the script is firmly set in the thirties with overly-melodramatic acting and music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edmund Goulding's 'Dark Victory (1939)' is a mature and professional exploration of terminal illness, a subject that I imagine would still have been relatively uncultivated cinema territory during the late 1930s. Bette Davis received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Judith, a lively young woman who develops and brain tumour and is given months to live. The nomination was her fourth from an incredible career-total of eleven, which included two Oscar wins for 'Dangerous (1935)' and 'Jezebel (1938),' respectively. The film is held together by a commendable cast of sensitive supporting performers, including George Brent as Dr. Frederick Steele, who falls in love with his patient and shatters every medical ethics code in the book, and especially Geraldine Fitzgerald, shortly after her arrival in Hollywood, as Judith's best friend and confidant. Let's not forget up-and-coming Humphrey Bogart as Michael O'Leary, Judith's roguish stableman, periodically dipping in and out of a bewildering Irish accent; nevertheless, there's a hungry fire in Bogart's eyes that correctly predicted the greater things to come.Whereas most commentators appear to have responded most strongly to Bette Davis, I wasn't quite so enthusiastic towards her performance. She was certainly good, but I found the character of Judith Traherne to be so incredibly arrogant, spoilt and stubborn that it's difficult to sympathise with much of her plight. At one point in the film, Ann (Geraldine Fitzgerald) describes Judith as a kind and selfless soul, but her description struck me as the typical rose-coloured illustration by which all deceased or dying acquaintances are remembered {in this case, however, there's not a hint of irony in Ann's observation, and the film obviously expects the audience to share her sincerity}. I found little to admire in Judith's extravagant and unproductive lifestyle, and her egotistical and combative personality - which, I suppose, could conceivably be interpreted as unique feminine independence - did little to recruit my sympathies. Fortunately, following her relocation to Vermont, Judith brightens up considerably, and it is not without an element of dignity that she finally departs from this life.</fullReview>

She turned it down because she was preparing to do a talking version of Anna Karenina at the time ("Love" had been a silent version)and so Selnick sold it to Warners. It's a pity she didn't do it. I think she would have been great, even though Davis is stunning in the role. Anyway, the next time you view "Dark Victory" try and imagine Garbo as the doomed heroine. She played doomed heroines very well you may recall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't help but like this film simply because I have a hard time disliking anything Bogart did. However, I despise Bette Davis, one of the most over-acclaimed over-acting starlets I've ever watched. George Brent is quite solid, though, and Geraldine Fitzgerald is fairly good in an unfortunately low-key role as best friend Miss Anne (and, personally, I find her much more attractive than Davis ever was). As well, Ronald Reagan's tiny role as a binge party-hound was really amusing. But Bogart was the shining light. Although his oft-slipping Irish accent left much to be desired, he was solid as the stable-hand, Michael O'Leary, and when he was on-screen, even Davis didn't seem so horrid. The plot was a fairly good one, though over-hyped and a tad too melodramatic at times. Overall, a decent film, but marred by too many oversights and under-achievements. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prognosis Negative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Bette Davis was in ball buster mode, watch out!! But when she decided to suffer nobly, she could suffer with the best of them.In "Dark Victory," Davis plays a woman dying from the deadliest of deadly diseases---the vague, unnamed illness that beautiful actresses died of in movies from the 1930s. The symptoms never seem to be the same, but they're always tear-inducing. Here, they make Davis go blind and we know when the disease is getting worse because a fuzzy black halo begins to appear around the edges of the frame.Actually, this movie is a rather pale companion to the ultimate Davis melodrama, "Now, Voyager." But it has perhaps my favorite line ever delivered in a Bette Davis movie. She's found out that her illness is fatal, and she's at dinner with the doctor who has kept this from her to protect her fragile soul. When the waiter comes to take her order, she says, "How about a nice big helping of..." pause, as she throws the most withering of withering stares at her companion ..."prognosis negative." That should really be on a bumper sticker somewhere.As for the other actors.....wait, other actors? No one watches a Bette Davis movie to see other actors. I'm not even sure there were any other actors in this movie.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: Davis is diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and has to come to terms with it, as well managing amorous advances from various quarters.A mixed bag, saved by the jittery brilliance of Bette Davis and solid performances from some of the supporting cast. Geraldine Fitzgerald as Davis's best friend stands out, and Humphrey Bogart, in a relatively minor role, steals almost every scene he appears in, in spite of an appalling attempted Irish accent.Geraldine Fitzgeralds's other big role was opposite Laurence Olivier in Wuthering Heights (also 1939), and she continued appearing in various supporting or minor roles into her eighties. She died in 1991. Like Ronald Regan, who pops up occasionally as a permanently intoxicated barfly, she developed dementia, so this adds an ironic poignancy to the movie.Aside from that, it's a curious mixture of wooden performances (including Davis's movie and real life beau, George Brent), wobbly backdrops and historical curiosity, with lighted cigarettes everywhere, even in the hospital wards. This was a decade and a half before the founding of the Actors Studio. Mannered, classical acting prevails, making the naturalistic talents of Bogart and Fitzgerald stand out even more. Bette Davis sits somewhere in the middle of these values in this movie, a combination of studio system old hat and raw ability. I initially scored this movie low, but both the performances and themes stayed in my mind ? the sign of a good movie, I think ? which bumped it up a notch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie for Bette Davis(Judith Traherne)as the follow up to Jezebel, which she won the Oscar for Best Actress on. It boasts one of the stronger supporting cast anyone could ever ask for in a movie. George Brent is about as good here as he gets in any film. Ronald Reagen is a drunken playboy who almost seems like a Democrat here, which in fact he was when this movie was made. Geraldine Fitzgerald is very good as Ann, her main female support &amp; best friend. Humphrey Bogart is cast as an Irish Horse trainer? This is strange casting but as Bogart does get a chance to make a pass at Judith during the film. He gets more of her attention than Reagen's Democratic drunk though not much more.Judith is in love with her surgeon doctor &amp; he is in love with her. Judith, the rich 23 year old play girl has a terminal disease. Her Doctor Frederick Steele knows it, but doesn't have the heart to tell her until she finds out on her own. Then she tries to spite her Doctor until she realizes that she really does love him, &amp; he knows that he loves her.This is one of the forgotten films of 1939, which while Bette gives a fine performance, didn't have a chance to be anything more than a historic foot note. Still, it is the last film Bette does before she goes in to her full bitch character she is in later films. She is a happy go lucky woman who reacts bitterly when she finds out her friends are holding out on her. Get the hankies out as sobbing is permitted. Only the cast gets to smoke &amp; drink lots of champagne.</fullReview>

Ms. Davis' performance is at times exceptional and other times it seems a bit histrionic and over-the-top. Why can't people just get sick and die in movies like everyone else? Also, Humphrey Bogart makes an appearance, but he is so miscast as an Irishman(!) and forgettable, you may have to strain to notice him.

There is no doubt that it is well-made: well directed, well written and except for Davis and Brent (did he ever act, it was always the same performance)well acted. All the Davis mannerisms are there and it is amazing how unattractive she really was which doesn't work well forthis character. Judith Traherne is abrasive and crude. Davis could give her some sympathy if she would just shut up, slow down and listen for a second instead of divaing it up every chance she gets. I laughed when they went into the explanation of how this contrived disease would progress. But the noble thing about the actors is that they treat the material as if it was all intelligent and sensible.Fitzgerald was such a fine actress that it is a shame she wasn't used more in leads. Bogart gave a decent Irish accent and his scene where he finally puts the moves on Davis is believable and touching. Reagan's character stays drunk and it is funny how as president, he so much behaved like this guy.It is too long. But had the lead been played by a good actor, not Davis, I think it would have been easier to buy into the contrivances.Still, there is nothing on film as fun as the moment when Bette Davis reads the menu.</fullReview>

Leigh deserved her Oscar this year for Gone with the Wind, as I consider it the best female performance of all time, but Davis here is in her same level actually. It's probably one of my all-time favorite leading female performances now, and that's quite a feat seeing as how from the five Davis I've seen, there's 3 in the Top 10 now probably.

		<fullReview>"Dark Victory" was a huge success for Bette Davis; the "women's picture" was entering its golden age, and the public ate it up, while the critics (who most often scoffed at such material) were unusually kind and lavished every acting superlative upon Davis. She was nominated for yet another Best Actress Oscar, and probably would have won, had she not been pitted against Vivien Leigh in "Gone with the Wind."However, Davis' performance is not nearly as controlled as it might have been. The director, Eddie Goulding, had a very good rapport with the star, but was hardly a rough taskmaster like William Wyler, who wrangled with Davis, cursed her out, and forced her to reign in her nervous quirks: the eye popping, the twitching walk, the flailing arms and hands. Under Goulding's direction, Davis gives a good performance, but not the great one many have claimed she did.SPOILERS TO FOLLOWJudith Tremaine (Davis) is a high-flying Long Island playgirl, concerned primarily with her horses, cocktails, and her sodden group of rich brat friends. The only voice of reason is her best friend, Ann (Geraldine Fitzgerald), who acts as both Judith's conscience and a Greek chorus in the film. Judith's eyesight, exacerbated by blinding headaches, has grown increasingly poor, deteriorating to the point that she is thrown from her prize stallion because she has double vision as she approaches a jump. Sufficiently shaken by this accident, Judith grudgingly agrees to visit neurosurgeon Dr. Steele (George Grent). Outwardly scornful and dismissive, Judith is actually very frightened, and Steele's quiet, authorative manner finally brings her to admit that her health has been in a downslide for some time. Steele diagnoses her with an incurable brain cancer, but he and Ann keep the truth from Judith--so that she may live a happy, unfettered life. Judith and Steele fall in love, and Judith seems to be on the path to a fulfilled life--she is no longer wrapped up in the superficialities of her socialite existance. However, Judith soon learns of her terminal condition, and lashes out at Steele, accusing him of wanting to marry her only out of pity. Choked with self-pity and rage, Judith embarks on a binge of drinking and partying, but, of course, comes back to Steele, so that she may live her final months on earth with dignity, and someone who truly loves her. Judith and Steele marry, move to Maine, and lead a happy, simple life. He works tirelessly at advances in neurology, while she devotes herself to enjoying life to the fullest--not through drink, but by sharing her life with someone. Ann comes for a visit just as Steele is called away to a medical conference; at that moment, Judith experiences a dimming of her vision--the telltale sign that her death is imminent. Determined to end her life with dignity and without hurting those she loves, she sends Ann away, manages to hide her blindness from Steele even as she "helps" him pack for his trip, bids him farewell, then climbs the stairs to her bedroom, where she peacefully and contentedly nears death as Max Steiner's score and an angelic choir soar behind her.Whew! Certainly, the plot was ripe for overdramatics, but handled properly, similar material could be done compellingly and with a minimum of corn (see Davis' own "Now, Voyager"). This is not a bad movie, by any means, but some of the scenes play very poorly indeed. Watching the increasingly blind Judith pack Steele's bags and then grope her way down the steps invariably induces this writer to giggles. (On the other hand, Judith's actual death scene, as mawkish as it sounds on paper, plays exceedingly well--choir or not.) Davis is wonderful in some scenes, and then completely over-the-top in others, giving her performance a somewhat off-kilter feel.The script, considering that it was written in 1939, has the right idea: Judith becomes insolent and self-pitying when she learns of her illness, not noble and self-sacrificing. Even after her "reform" and marriage to Steele, Judith is thankfully not written as a latter-day saint. Also adding immeasurably is Geraldine Fitzgerald's marvelous portrayal of Ann; her cool, elegant beauty and wonderful speaking voice are perfect for the character. Her tearful (but not maudlin) reactions to Judith's illness, negative prognosis, and death also effectively relieve the Judith character from having to similarly be awash in tears--a very wise move."Dark Victory" is quite a good film, extremely well-produced, and smartly scripted. However, it might have been a truly towering achievement, had stronger direction been applied to Davis. Unquestionably, Miss Davis was one of the greatest actresses in film history, but it is also undeniable that without a strong presence at the helm, she was prone to overplaying. That is why her portrait of Judith Tremaine just misses greatness.</fullReview>
