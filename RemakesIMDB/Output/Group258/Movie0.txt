		<shortDescription>The epitome of cinema cool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever watched Pulp Fiction and thought: movie cool was born here, or maybe you saw any single Sergio Leone movie and thought: this guy invented movie-cool (if you haven't, i thoroughly recommend it - Kill Bill is nothing to his Good, the Bad and the Ugly or Once Upon a Time in the West), then experience Yojimbo, or The Bodyguard. Kurosawa's camera sits behind Toshiro Mifune's man-with-no-name, inviting us to look up at the back of his head as he walks the earth, inviting us to be in awe of this man. And as he walks, super-cool walking-the-earth music plays. Later on, when he's taunted and asked to prove himself, he slices a guy's arm off and plays the petty, money-grabbing rival factions in the town he wanders into off each other.If you have it in your mind that a guy called Kurosawa couldn't make movies that would impress you, that the cultural gap would be too great - be assured that Kurosawa's movies are rife with Western values. Sure, they are rife with Japanese values (i am told), but Kurosawa had a great appreciation of Western culture. He based many of his movies on Western texts, like Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, or American gangster fiction and film. Yojimbo is one of the latter - inspired by the Dashiell Hammet novel Red Harvest (Hammett's novel The Maltese Falcon was put onscreen moment for moment by John Huston in the movie of the same name which immortalised Humphrey Bogart).Actually, the history of the story of the lone wolf, the wanderer with a weapon, who rides into town to play off two warring factions against each other - is quite a story itself. Dashiell Hammett, an American, wrote a novel with an American private eye as the stranger. In 1961, Akira Kurosawa transposed this story to medieval Japan, after the fall of a dynasty, where a Samurai finds himself with no place to go (at the beginning, we see him throw a branch up in the air and walk the direction it falls), and no master to serve. A bodyguard with no-one to protect. In 1964, Sergio Leone transposed the screenplay of Yojimbo (nearly word for word) to the spanish desert, and he brought along a young television actor named Clint Eastwood, and together they revolutionised the western with Fistfull of Dollars, and created an entire genre, the Spaghetti Western, which sported among its attributes a gritty, desolate landscape, and a cynical, postmodern lack-of-values ideology (traditional American westerns had quite plush landscapes and were always black and white (good and evil) in their value system. Despite the massive influence of Fistfull of Dollars, it pales in comparison to both its predecessor Yojimbo, and its sequals, For a Few Dollars More and The Good the Bad and the Ugly. But still, both Yojimbo and Fistful are iconic movies, and very cool movies.With cool music, a cool anti-hero, a fun script, and a visually spectacular canvas of an image, painted by the eye of an artist (it is said that Kurosawa storyboarded his movies in full-scale paintings), Yojimbo is one of the coolest movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only a handful of directors know atmosphere the way Akira Kurosawa does, only a handful. Yojinbo opens with a tracking shot of a ronin samurai walking down a dusty road. The camera wisely stays behind the samurai, played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role. His presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn't on camera. All film buffs should watch this film, it is a perfect example of a director and actor with confidence in their craft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First class samurai action tale with philosophy to boot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic samurai action pic; often imitated but never equalled. Mifune creates a memorable character (who appeared in a sequel) in the Ronin who decides the course of his life on the toss of a stick, and ends up risking his life to save a village full of peasants he finds revolting. It's possible to see "Yojimbo's" actions as either heroic or as the game of a bored warrior in need of amusement -- as often in Kurosawa's films, the fact that the characters' motives remain open to interpretation adds depth to the film.Wonderful images, and skillful direction that keeps the pace of the storytelling tight and tells most of the story through images -- this is the kind of film that is so good it can be watched a silent film without losing too much of its impact or meaning.I think that if Kurosawa had spent more of his time in litigation and less making movies, he might have made a living for the rest of his life off all the movies that have ripped off this movie. Certainly Eastwood's "Man with No Name" character owes a lot to Mifune's contribution; not only in Leone's films (the first of which borrows its entire plot from Kurosawa; a court settlement ensued which made sure Kurosawa made most of the profits from "Fistful of Dollars" in Asia his own) but also in Eastwood's best film as a director -- "High Plains Drifter", which borrows scenes such as Eastwood's rebuke of the villagers from "Yojimbo". The really funny thing about all this, and what not too many American critics or audiences have noted, is that "Yojimbo" is itself a western. All the ingredients for a western are here, and the film's plot and style obviously owe a debt to Zinnemann's "High Noon". "Yojimbo" even borrows the device of time, setting up a confrontation at 3:00 a.m. as shouted by the town crier. I like "Yojimbo" better than "High Noon", so I don't want to go too far into this line of thought....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For sheer entertainment value 'Yojimbo' is hard to beat! The Kurosawa movie I enjoy the most.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to waste time debating which was the "greatest" or "best" of Kurosawa's movies, but if you want to know the one I enjoy the most it's 'Yojimbo'. 'Rashomon' and 'Throne Of Blood' are probably deeper and more substantial, but for sheer entertainment value 'Yojimbo' is hard to beat! Being a Kurosawa movie it's no surprise that it stars Toshiro Mifune. The two made many movies together, but this is the performance I like to watch the most. I love looking at Mifune's face! His expressions are awesome. He was without a doubt one of the 20th centuries greatest movie stars. 'Yojimbo' was a massive influence on many spaghetti westerns, specifically 'A Fistful Of Dollars', but before you bay for Sergio Leone's blood, please read Dashiell Hammett's detective classic 'Red Harvest', published in 1929 and you'll see that Kurosawa lifted his plot from it. I see no mention whatsoever of this source material in the credits for 'Yojimbo', so let's just leave the Leone bashing alone okay? Many people have convincingly argued that samurai movies were inspired by classic American westerns anyway. Walter Hill later "remade" 'Yojimbo' (or 'Red Harvest' depending on your perspective) as 'Last Man Standing' and David Lynch gave a small nod to it in his 'Wild At Heart'. You can certainly see both the samurai and spaghetti influences in Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' 1 and 2, that's for sure. "Influences", "inspirations", these are things that go around and around, it's what a writer or film maker does with them that counts. 'Yojimbo' is a classic action movie. Maybe only 'Wages Of Fear' is better. Every film buff needs this movie in their collection!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo is a not too long, not too short action film that uses its action with just the right touches of voracity and excitement, and in the backdrop is also a sense of humor to the process. If I had to recommend a Kurosawa film to someone who's never seen one before (and might be impatient to sit through the three and a half hour Seven Samurai, or might not get the non-linear structure of Rashomon), I'd put this one in their hands to try out.Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune is terrific as Sanjuro Kuwabatake, a drifter of a samurai who stumbles upon a town with an assorted cast of characters, with a split between two gangs. One of the gangsters, Unosuke (Nakadai), is the only one in town; it seems, with a gun. At first Sanjuro plays each side, but when he gets beaten roughly by whom he was "protecting", he realizes the fun's over, and it's time to fight back.Much has been made about how Sergio Leone took Kurosawa's story and characters (most in particular being a rogue from out of town) and made them into his breakthrough Fistful of Dollars- Kurosawa even sued Leone over the story rights. But to those who wonder whether Yojimbo is 'better' than Fistful or vice versa need to remember one of two things- Kurosawa took the story from Dashiell Hammett's gangster novel Red Harvest, so neither filmmaker is making something really original; and that since each film is made in a different continent, and with the slightest different sensibilities about its characters. For one thing in Yojimbo guns are scarcer than in Fistful, and there's a treatment Kurosawa has with his actors that sets it apart from the small town western scope of Leone's weapons and actors. So each film (noticeably) carries its own kind of visual style while working in a similar plot structure. In other words, it's kind of like comparing apples and oranges picked in the same farm (if that makes at all sense).Overall, Yojimbo on its own is a lean, cool Japanese crime/action film, helmed by a master, and featuring a number of highlights to look forward to on multiple viewings. Some of those include: the scene inside Seibei's brothel (with the women dancing and singing), Masaru Sato's wonderful musical orchestrations, Mifune's curiously low-key and rough performance (which did and didn't serve as inspiration to Clint), and a climax that is up there with one of Kurosawa's finest battles.

		<shortDescription>Sensational!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to choose only one movie for film students to learn from, this would be it. Other films may be more profound, or their imagery more groundbreaking, but this one is so tightly constructed that nothing - not a frame, word, or gesture - is extraneous.Toshiro Mifune, one of the world's most charismatic actors, is perfection as a tough loner of a samurai who takes it upon himself to clean up a town corrupted by two gambling clans. Swirling through and around him is a story that is both technically flawless and profoundly moving.Kurosawa meticulously infuses every detail with meaning; there's a purpose behind every shot, and aspiring directors should pay close attention (why is the camera slightly tilted? why are there concubines in the background?). His economy of style was never more amazing; watch as the samurai rides into town, and the director establishes the atmosphere with exactly one jaw-dropping shot. And the story is equally well-crafted, with no plot holes and no inconsistencies.A wonderful tale that rolls beautifully from start to finish. See it, see it, see it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie with one cool character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just figured out why Toshirô Mifune is so mesmerizing to watch. It's just the way he expresses himself. This guy's amazing!I've been exploring the halls of Kurosawa and it's getting hard to leave. Yojimbo is a FUN film to watch. Toshiro as the samurai steals almost every scene he is in and I think the epitome of his character is when he's in Gonji's place lying on the floor. He doesn't brag, but when he goes into action, that's it! As soon as he enters the chaotic town, he doesn't seem fazed at all and actually enjoys it. His demeanor is really amusing and it's great watching his plan unfold; how he manipulates both groups to get his way (it's really funny). Great thing too is he's not really a hero and he's not entirely a villain. He doesn't hesitate to kill, but does so methodically. You also have "characters" including Gonji, the thugs from both sides, and Unosuke with an ace up his sleeve (or robe?) which makes things really interesting.Yojimbo's mix of dark humor, action, and a great performance from Mifune make for a Kurosawa classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's most entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yojimbo, based on noir writer Dashiel Hammett's Red Harvest is a magnificently entertaining film. Toshiro Mifune stars as the nobody who calls himself Sanjuro (thirty but closer to forty). He enters a town destroyed by warring factions and plays a double-game to pit one faction against the other thus destroying the criminal element.Yojimbo (aka The Bodyguard) is one of the coolest and most stylish films ever made. Starring Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's favorite actor, as the scruffy looking Samurai, Yojimbo has all of Kurosawa's qualities and none of the flaws. The music score is an essential element of the plot and strikingly good, but admittedly bettered by the Ennio Morricone version in the Spaghetti Western remake Fistful of Dollars. The visuals are great, from the samurai swordplay, to the desolate streets, the town crier announcing its 3 a.m. to the brutal torture scene.One of the unique things about Yojimbo is the central character. He is an anti-hero. We see him initially as a killer and a man greedy for money. But then, he saves a family by re-uniting mother and child and giving them all the money he was advanced. Mifune has never been cooler than in this film and Eastwood could only aspire to equal such a performance.Of the two remakes, I liked Fistful of Dollars for starting the Spaghetti Western genre, although Yojimbo is a far more superior and stylish film. The gangster version, Last Man Standing, was not very good and Bruce Willis made for a poor substitute to Yojimbo. This film looks fresh and undated even today - watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune - The undisputed masters of their respective arts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yojimbo is a timeless masterpiece; elegant, enigmatic and taut; one of the best and the most influential of the action movies, and a delectable feast to the lovers of the genre. It is the most sought-after of the Akira Kurosawa's movies, shamelessly imitated on multiple occasions ? the most infamous being 'A Fistful of Dollars' by Sergio Leone. Yojimbo is a delightful addition to an unending list of avant-garde movies made by the Oriental master. It is as superior to any of the movies that it has inspired as a master is to his artless apprentice. I have had the privilege of watching five Kurosawa movies before watching Yojimbo viz. Seven Samurai, Ran, Dersu Uzala, Rashomon, and High &amp; Low and each left me mesmerized, but in a completely different manner than the last. In my past reviews I have repeatedly committed an invidious blunder of failing to acknowledge the ginormous contribution that Toshiro Mifune made in Kurosawa's colossal success. I would be remiss again if I fail to testify the fact that Yojimbo is more synonymous with Mifune than it is with Kurosawa and anyone who has had the privilege of watching it wouldn't want me to budge even by a slightest degree. The role of 'Sanjuro', though demanding, can be any performer's dream, but a slight lack of proficiency or commitment on his part can serve as a volte-face, transforming it into his biggest nightmare. I don't think that anyone but Kurosawa is competent enough to judge Toshiro Mifune's talent as a performer and so I would like to quote an excerpt from his biography: "Mifune had a kind of talent I had never encountered before in the Japanese film world. It was, above all, the speed with which he expressed himself that was astounding. The ordinary Japanese actor might need ten feet of film to get across an impression; Mifune needed only three. He put forth everything directly and boldly with a great sense of timing. And yet with all his quickness, he also had surprisingly fine sensibilities".In Yojimbo, Toshiro Mifune incredibly outdoes himself with a portrayal that can be excruciatingly hard to be described in words. Mifune is crafty, cunning, capricious and yet seemingly nonchalant as the ingeniously disingenuous ronin, a portrayal overwhelmed with so many contrasting attributes that it revolutionized the very concept of an anti-hero in the world of cinema. Sanjuro is a cross between a wolf and a sheep, a guardian and a usurper, a misanthrope and an altruist, a demon and an angel, a libertine and an ascetic, a fiend and a beloved, a mercenary and a messiah and that's what makes this portrayal singular and incredibly magnificent. Mifune has meticulously taken care of even the slightest gestures and the subtle changes in mannerisms during the portrayal; be it Sanjuro's perpetually grinned countenance or his nonchalant disposition. Each triviality and nuance evinces certain details that are hard to be expressed even through expatiation. Despite Sanjuro's rapidly changing expressions and his frenzied demeanor, Mifune always seems to be in absolute control.Yojimbo is a well etched, taut narrative with a dark comical look that makes it one of a kind. Yojimbo neither appears to be superficial nor superfluous and not a moment of it is extraneous. Human values and emotions are ubiquitously similar irrespective of the cultural and the social divide between the peoples of the world and hence everyone can savour the thought-provoking movies of Kurosawa; even those who are daunted by the handicap of using subtitles can relish a movie like Yojimbo as a silent movie (because of it being so visually descriptive like the Charlie Chaplin movies). The plot of the movie is simple and may even appear to be commonplace owing to the countless imitations that it has inspired, but it is the rapport between Kurosawa and Mifune (undoubtedly the best director-actor pair of all time) that makes it so especial and unique. A penniless ronin (samurai without a master) enters a town rotten with schism (Akira Kurosawa challenged his assistant directors to come up with an image for the film to let Sanjuro know he was entering a bad town. Eventually, Kurosawa himself came up with the idea of the dog carrying the human hand). The two gangs are sporadically involved in sanguinary duels resulting in mass slaughter. The ronin demonstrates his skills by slaying two members of one of the gangs. After asseverating his supremacy, he joins the other group for a substantial sum, but backs out just when a decisive battle was about to begin. He then climbs the nearby bell tower as a vantage for himself and watches with rapturous glee the bravado of the pusillanimous gang members disappearing in thin air as they are overcome by trepidation. They lunge and retreat on multiple occasions without making an actual contact before getting interrupted by the news of an inspector coming for an official inspection. The duel is postponed indefinitely to everyone's delight. In the meantime, Sanjuro lets them know that his services are open to bidding, inducing a tussle to acquire his services while he continues to act as an instigator further intensifying the rabid rivalry between the two groups. But soon the tables are turned and this child's play transforms into a moment of reckoning for the ronin as he finds himself haplessly pitted against the surviving gang. He is captured and brutally assaulted, but he manages to escape from some local help. This culminates in one of the best climatic endings of all time as Sanjuro single-handedly obliterates the whole gang, emancipating the town from anarchy and barbarism. It's a must watch for film students, action movie lovers, and especially those who want to acquaint themselves with the eccentrically brilliant works of the oriental master without exposing themselves to his more recondite works like Shichinin no samurai, Rashomon, Ikiru, Akahige, Ran and countless others. An absolute gem: 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reinventing the Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a string of classic masterpieces, Kurosawa confronted his influences head-on. Throwing John Ford's Western aesthetics into a blender and painting them pitch black. The results are Yojimbo and its legacy.Yojimbo ("the bodyguard") is the tale of a flea-ridden wandering swordsman, Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune, in his finest performance). He arrives at a gang-war ravaged town and starts hiring himself out to both sides, playing them off against another, in order to wipe all the scum out. Sound familiar?Even though Yojimbo the film is a thrilling ride and very funny dark comedy, it is hard to imagine what a bombshell this was for audiences at the time of its release. It is as far removed as can be from the then squeaky-clean aesthetic of samurai films: you can almost smell the sweat and the grime of the sordid town and characters. The action is fast and furious, enhanced by Kurosawa's deft use of telephoto lenses and Masaru Sato's avant-garde score. With all that, Yojimbo was a massive kick in the pants of a fossilized genre.It exploded beyond the confines of its own country and genre, forever influencing the very Westerns that had inspired it, particularly a new wave out of Spain and Italy at the time. One Sergio Leone copy/pasted the whole plot into his own revisionist Western and gave us the Dollars trilogy. The slightest of Spaghetti Western enthusiasts owes Kurosawa a debt of gratitude.As with all truly great work, its greatness exists even devoid of context, and for all the historical precedents it set, all Kurosawa wanted to make was an entertaining film. That he bloody well succeeded is the least you can say about Yojimbo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.We are indebted to Kurosawa for one big thing and a couple small ones. Among the small ones is the deconstruction of the western, which was transformed forever by the chain of events started by (and depicted in?) this film. I recommend Yojimbo if only because of this importance.That chain starts with the spaghetti westerns which introduced irony into most elements of the form more obviously for us, well westerners. And it finishes (probably) with `Star Wars,' which is nothing more than a slightly shifted selfaware goof on the already outed western. That this is based on a Hammett story should be a tipoff as he did the same for the mystery genre. Kurosawa did this knowingly of course. You can see his other projects marching through other notions of film and revolutionizing them.Naturally, there are other values here: perfect framing; multiplanar visual storytelling through mime; and a camera that denotes the eye of fate. But by the time one gets to this after seeing such masterpieces as `Ran' and `Rashomon' and `Seven Samurai,' especially the first, one gets used to expecting skill from Kurosawa equalling the skill of his samurai avatar.If you know what this movie is all about, it puts `Last Man Standing' in a much more intelligent and cinematically important perspective. The title of this comment refers to the fact that it is essentially impossible to see any movie today and not be in part watching a Kurosawa film.Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 4 -- worth watching</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's Influential Stroke Of Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa is widely (and rightly) thought of as one of the most important filmmakers in the history of motion pictures. "Yojimbo", one of the masterpieces that have earned him this more than deserved reputation, is not only one of the best, but also one of the most influential movies ever made. Only three years after its release another great director, Sergio Leone, who named Yojimbo one of his favorite movies, used it as the model for another masterpiece, "A Fistful Of Dollars" and rose the Italian Western to an international level.In 1860, a time when the sword is still the most common weapon in the Japanese province, but gradually gets replaced by the revolver, a lonely Ronin, a Samurai without a master to serve,(Toshiro Mifune) who dashes around the county, comes to a little town terrorized by two bosses and their criminal gangs and decides to end the people's suffering and free the town. He is hired by one of the gangs as a bodyguard, only to switch sides and pit the two, already hostile, gangs against each other.Toshiro Mifune, one of the greatest character actors of all time, is impressive in his role of the Samurai, generally the acting is great in this movie, the supporting cast contains such actors as the great and unforgettable Takashi Shimura. The cinematography is great and the movie's brilliant score, composed by Fumio Hayasaka, is one of its kind. The writing and directing by the inimitable Akira Kurosawa is more than brilliant. One of the greatest movies by one of the greatest directors of all-time, and an absolute must-see for everyone interested in cinema!</fullReview>

The Seven Samurai was remade in America as The Magnificent Seven, and our next film, Yojimbo was remade almost scene by scene as A Fistful of Dollars.The story takes place in 18th century Japan, a time when Samurai wandered the lands. A lone samurai, Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshiro Mifune) drifts into a small town. Soon he discovers that the town is divided into two groups who are constantly fighting with one another. Sanjuro sees this as an easy opportunity to make money by lending his services to both sides, but soon he becomes too much involved and is tossed into prison. After escaping, he sees that the two sides are locked in a fierce battle and decides to end their feud once and for all.Yojimbo was an instant hit across Japan as well as internationally.

		<shortDescription>Japanese Red Harvest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the middle '20's, Dashiell Hammett (best known as author of "The Maltese Falcon") wrote two unrelated novels, "The Glass Key", about Ned Beaumont an alcoholic gambler who uses duplicity to save his mob boss from taking a murder rap for a corrupt politician (all the while fending off a rival mobster), and 'Red Harvest", in which a nameless private eye (also alcoholic, a status shared by many Hammett heroes) is hired to clean up a small town kept in fear by two warring boot-leg mobs.I believe "Red Harvest" did make it to film in the '30's, but I haven't been able to track that down and never saw it. "The Glass Key" was first made into a (not too successful) film in 1935, and then re-made in 1942. The remake concerns us here. Directed by Stuart Heisler in a style that compounds the typical crime film briskness of the '30's with the shaded undertones of the then developing 'noir' genre, it is actually quite a good film, and in a number of ways daring for its period. True to the novel, literally everyone in the film is corrupt in some way, and especially fascinating is the appearance of William Bendix in a minor role of an overtly homosexual sadist of a thug. Alan Ladd plays Ned Beaumont as a true anti-hero, cold, calculating, true to no ethic but his own - a type Hollywood at that time was having problems presenting, since the strong ethics of the character undercut all the assumptions of sociopathy of such types popular at the time. The film finally betrays itself with a "kiss-and-make-up" final scene that completely undercuts the ethical problematic of the novel (in which Beaumont finally betrays his boss by running off with the boss' fiancée). But until then, the movie moves towards its dark "who-dun-it" revelation rapidly and filled with tension.There is a scene dead center in "The Glass Key" where Beaumont is captured by the rival mob boss and tortured by the sadistic thug (which is from the novel), and filled with Freudian undertones due to the homosexuality of the torturing thug (Bendix) (also implicit in the novel). I think it was Japanese cinema expert Donald Ritchie from whom I remember an anecdote that it was this scene that fascinated Akira Kurosawa to such an extent that he felt compelled to make a film based on a Hammett novel. Interestingly, he did not do a remake of "The Glass Key", however. Instead, he transposed "Red Harvest" to the Japan of the civil wars of the 1860's, rewriting the nameless private eye as an equally nameless wandering samurai (played with exquisite panache by Toshiro Mifuni), while at the same time parodying the typical *chambara* (swordfight film) popular in Japan. I refer of course to "Yojombo" (1962). Nonetheless, the the torture sequence is lifted from "The Glass Key" and interjected as a pivotal scene in "Yojimbo". A couple of subtractions and additions need be noted here: Kurosawa strips the Freudian subtext out of the torture sequence completely, so that the torture becomes a study in the what Hannah Arendt referred to as the "banality" of evil" - the torturers are just doing a job. This fits neatly with the critique of capitalism implicit in the film, and which is equally implicit in the Hammett original, so the loss of Freudian content goes by unnoticed.On the other hand, Kurosawa and Mifune add an earthiness to the nameless hero lacking in Hammett's tension filled original: Mifune's samurai is always scratching, eating, cringing or sneering. Perhaps this is to make up for the subtraction of the element of alcoholism that was the chief weakness of Hammett's anti-hero. But it also has the effect of rounding out the character so that he becomes human to us in a way Hammett's anti-hero is not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Yojimbo", Japanese for "bodyguard" is the story of Sanjuro Kuwabatake, (Mifune) a samurai without a master or anyone to protect who walks into a small Japanese village that is rife with violence caused by two feuding groups. The boss of each group tries to hire Sanjuro, who decides to solve the village's issues by pitting one side against another. Problems arise for Sanjuro when the son of one of the bosses shows up, who brandishes a gun and absolutely is not afraid to use it."Yojimbo" was later remade into "A Fist Full of Dollars", featuring Clint Eastwood, and the similarities are certainly prevalent, particularly with their respective "heroes". Mifune, a great actor who is able to be extremely expressive without the benefit of a lot of dialogue, is once again excellent in this film. The story itself is a good one, and the film was entertaining overall. I fear, however, that I may have either tried to watch too much Kurosawa in a short period of time, or that I may have seen his three best too early, because there wasn't a lot that excited me in this film as opposed to say, "The Seven Samurai", "Rashomon" or "High and Low". At times the film seemed to drag a little, and Unosuke, the guy with the gun, became kind of a joke because after awhile the way he was acting menacing with his gun was really pretty humorous. I kept thinking about the Simpsons episode when Homer joins the NRA and was using his gun for everything, including turning on the television, and I don't think that was the reaction that Kurosawa intended.I'm not panning the film as a whole; I just think that "Yojimbo" is perhaps not one of Kurosawa's great films. Every great director has some films that don't seem to be in the same league as their masterpieces, (though I have yet to watch a Kubrick film that hasn't left me breathless with admiration) and I'm certain that Kurosawa is no exception. Because the film was decent, but not great, I'm giving it a decent, but not great rating ? an average 5/10.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Toshiro Mifune</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'm a great Toshiro Mifune fan and for that, this is one of the movies you have to watch. This Kurosawa story was remade by Sergio Leone as a Fistful of Dollars and Walter Hill's Last Man Standing. It was one of the first action flicks ever made; and for the first time presented the nameless action hero, who comes to town to set it free. He is always cool, always confident and a master of his skills, loves drinks and takes outs his enemies in a second. The acting of Mifune is superb and his figure inspired Clint Eastwood to stick a cigarette in his jaw just for the coolness factor in the old western movies (Mifune chewed on straw). I don't think Western action cinema and the representation of the main "hero" would have developed in the fashion they did, if Mifune never would have worked together with Kurosawa. Their influence is definitely large.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like Mifune as a samurai, this is the one not to miss. Unlike Seven Samurai, where he's not really a samurai, in this one he is a fully-qualified, if masterless samurai. This is more of a "pure samurai action" movie than Seven*. The story is simpler and moves along faster, and Mifune doesn't have to share the spotlight with others so much. It's his movie, and is he ever "bad"!There's a scene in the movie that puzzles me, I had to watch it several times, and still don't get it: It's where some government officials visit the village our hero's "saving", and soon find themselves passed out on some spiked sake... the man who's serving them goes up to each of the two passed-out officials, and replaces their little bottles from behind, and then gives their sleeve a snap as if to straighten out the fabric, and gives a little snappy salute or something I can't figure it out, maybe you can.If you like samurai movies, you just gotta see this one, no getting out of it. Dig the theme music for Mifune's character played on a baritone sax.. he's baaaaaad!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Composition And Influence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Kurosawa did in a short space of years is nothing short of revolutionary. American cinema (post WWII to Vietnam)was largely confined to self-affirming stereotypes -- especially in Westerns dominated by the Ford/Wayne cartoon good guy paradigm.He turned all of that upside down (aided and abetted by Leone). His samurai existed more as a tragic Greek figure -- afflicted by a fatal flaw -- rather than the guy who simply wears the 'white hat'. This is combined with Mifune's remarkable skill at creating the character and making the character (not the actor) live in the cinematic space.The key to this movie is the unprecedented visual composition. Images assemble into the frame, stacked two and three layers deep with no vanishing point. All of the elements are in the same focus, resembling a Japanese watercolor painting. Then Kurosawa cuts to a right angle shot (to the imaginary 'left' of the framing shot), twisting our perception around of just how deep the placement is. He also composes scenes that openly reference that this is 'being watched' - note the characters peering through windows at a second layer (usually mimed action) in the background, again all in the same focus. The effects here are striking, to say the least.Try to imagine Clint's man with no name characters, or 'Star Wars'(hacked off arm, a la Obi-Wan), or the 'Kill Bill' volumes (the one against many swordfights and beating inflicted on the bride) -- these are some off the top of the head examples, and there are countless more -- without the influence of this movie. It's impossible. By the mid-60's, Clint's amoral, stoic gunfighter had displaced his forerunners, changing the equation forever.Essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homo Homini Lupus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The famous Latin phrase "homo homini lupus" meaning "man is a wolf to (his fellow) man," could easily be the motto of Akira Kurosawa's 21st film Yojimbo (1961). It is purely a genre-film at its best: a film in which the basic realizations and contents of a genre have been internalized perfectly. In this case the genre is samurai-film which is strongly related to the genre of western. Whereas from western the American mythology exhales, from samurai-film Japanese does. Although, the history of samurai-film extends to the 1930-40's it found its dynamic form and was truly born in the early 1950's when Japanese films first came to Europe. The genre still lives on but Yojimbo is, without a doubt, among the five best samurai-films ever made. Both, ironic humor and conception of the eternal weakness of the human nature characterize this exquisite film about a mythical character.Western and samurai-film are often compared to each other, and Kurosawa has said that: "Everybody likes a good western. Because people are weak, they want to see good people and great heroes. Westerns have been made over and over again and in this process a certain grammar has developed and I have leaned something from it.". They both take place to important phases of their country's national history and in the focus there are armed heroes. The heroes are often marginal characters in the society who return order to it but are also conscious of the fact that their virtuous action doesn't take them to the new, better, ordered society. And this is exactly what happens in Yojimbo as it does in A Fistful of Dollars for example. Kurosawa had the habit of placing his stories to history, far away, so the producers and managers of film companies wouldn't get upset of his anti-feudalism. On the big screen, he was safely able to tell about his thoughts without them being directly linked to the present day ? and that's why it is samurai-film that he most eagerly studied.The story of Yojimbo is, from today's perspective, classical and has been lent dozens of times in A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Last Man Standing (1996) for instance. The Japanese word 'yôjinbô' means a bodyguard or a hit man and that is exactly what the protagonist of this film is. The film happens in a simple milieu where two selfish robber gangs work. Soon an unknown samurai ? played by Toshirô Mifune ? arrives to the town and offers his services to one of the gangs. He cheats the other by claiming that he would be working for them. The other gang finds out and tortures him. However, soon our hero escapes and after a few days recovery he overthrows the hostile gang of 20 bandits and leaves the town in peace. There are no good and evil; just two evils from which the protagonist has to choose. We all know this situation. An ethical dilemma that is impossible to solve. We want to end the battle between these two evil but can't because we are too weak. In this the hero of Yojimbo differs from us. He can stand in the middle and quit the fighting. For Kurosawa this kind of social action is serious business and that's why he doesn't make a big deal out of it. He hasn't placed any hidden morality behind the hero's acts.Yojimbo shows that "man is a wolf to a man," how people in reality are animals. The humor comes from the fact that we are quite ridiculous when we think that we are trying to attain morally righteous solutions. The message of Yojimbo and so many films seems to be that the world can't be observed through absolute morality. Both utilitarianism and virtue ethics collapse in the world of Kurosawa. For example, Sanjuro's only virtue is that he doesn't try to be bad, all the time. At times, he might make decisions that ostensibly are good but are actually built on selfish acts. Out of no solidarity or anything that has something to do with morality, he helps one evil to win over another. After he has performed his duty he can walk away and forget all about it. He resembles a god in Greek tragedies: he descends down, does his mission and once again disappears. In one particularly intriguing scene he climbs up and looks down at people, from the roof. He watches the lives of people as a grand comedy ? a seedy anti-hero observing.Yojimbo happens in a stripped, closed and simplified landscape in which ruthless and completely selfish and unethical groups of bandits work. Their cruel attitude towards the world is relayed to us most luminously in the scene where one bandit says to his son that: "To gain respect one has to kill more." Irony and humor mean complete destruction of morality. The desolation of Kurosawa's world view is most brilliantly projected on the life of Unosuke, the gunfighter. First his sight is innocent and curious. But soon the cruel corrupted world teaches its lesson and therefore he becomes a mighty gunman who digs up his own grave: "He died like he lived."At times, Yojimbo is close to self-parody but Kurosawa brilliantly reflects the violence culture in the zone of irony and consciousness. Yojimbo is a pure genre-film. But it is also full of subjectivity and personal sights. Death instinct, life at the gates of hell, the harsh reality of heroism, life control and violence culture viewed under the samurai myth but, in addition, Yojimbo talks about war-like glory and sense of morality: the protagonist isn't a moralist. No higher moral purpose hides behind his action than cleaning up the town. He is cynical, melancholy and has a total lack of morality. Yojimbo is, at its heart, about an ethical dilemma, it's about the inevitable dialog between loyalty and glory. It is a grand story of humanity and morality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When it comes to entertainment value, "Yojimbo" is Kurosawa's best work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rashomon" and "The Seven Samurai" may be better as films, but when it comes to entertainment value, "Yojimbo" is Kurosawa's best work. In my mind, it is only rivaled by "The Wild Bunch" and "The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Ugly" as the finest action film ever made. Its amazing how this film is over forty years old and manages to be far more exciting than anything churned out by Hollywood hacks such as Michael Bay nowadays. It is one of the most absolutely perfect films ever made, not to mention having the most bad ass anti-hero to ever grace the screen. As much as I love the remake "A Fistful of Dollars", "Yojimbo" runs rings around it in every department.What makes Toshiro Mifune so bad ass in this film is the complexity of his character. In one scene he is greedy and playing two gangs for their money, yet in the next he is helping a family reunite and escape from their death. You root for his character because he only brings harm to utterly detestable human beings. As an actor, Mifune was peerless when playing these kinds of characters. This was obviously a huge influence on the later anti-heroes that emerged in Hollywood later that decade such as Lee Marvin. Another groundbreaking aspect of the film is its use of humor. Mifune wisecracks throughout and you laugh at the sheer stupidity of the gangs. Ever since, some comedy is a necessary aspect of all action flicks. While it may not be his best, this is certainly the master Kurosawa's most entertaining and possibly most accessible film. Even those weaned on all the John Woo ripoffs will be enticed by it.

There's nothing in Jimbo like the stylistic battle scenes in Samurai. And the character development is far more limited. The fight scenes look static and the acting is real real over the top like live Shakespeare. Mifune does okay , but scratches his beard once too often.No make that twenty times too often. For me Kurosawa's two best are The Idiot and Samurai with portions of Ikiru,especially the scene with the stripper. This one is over rated .

		<shortDescription>The Saga of a Samurai Without a Master, in Another Great Movie of Akira Kurosawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshirô Mifune) is a samurai without a master, drifting without any specific destination. He arrives in a small village, dominated by two lords: Seibei, who produces silk, and Ushitora, who produces sake. Both of them explore gambling, and uses fugitive gangster for the protection of their business. They are constantly fighting against each other. Sanjuro offers his service of bodyguard for both of them and waits for the best offer. The end of the story recalls those Italian ('spaghetti') western movies, with the death of all 'bad guys'. This movie is very different from other Akira Kurosawa's masterpieces. The plot has adventure, excellent choreography in the sword fights and lots of black humor. In accordance with the information on the cover of the DVD, Sergio Leone used parts of this screenplay in his wonderful 'Fistful of Dollars'. The negative point is the DVD released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Continental. The subtitles have many problems in translation, synchronization and concordance in Portuguese. In some parts, it is very difficult to follow the story, since I can not understand Japanese. Further, there is a bug and the DVD freezes at 75:51 min. I tried two DVDs and both presented the same problem. The solution is to go back to the 'Menu', select the next chapter and 'rewind' back to 75:52 min. Although presenting problems on the Brazilian DVD, the movie is excellent and worthwhile. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): 'Yojimbo'05 January 2005: I have just received the following remark from an IMDb User: "Yojimbo doesn't "recall those Italian ('spaghetti') western movies, with the death of all 'bad guys'," considering that Yojimbo was released in 1961, and the entire GENRE of "Spaghetti Westerns" didn't really exist previous to Leone's Fistful of Dollars. You've made the classic mistake of mixing up cause and effect."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Akira Kurisowa's Yojimbo is a masterpiece. Yojimbo is still pretty sharp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loosely based on Dashiell Hammett's western novel Red Harvest and Glass Key. This jidaigeki (period drama film), tells the story of an unnamed ronin (Toshiro Mifune), who arrives in a small town in 1860 Japan, where competing crime lords, Seibei, the Brothel Owner (Seizaburô Kawazu) and Ushitora, the Arms Dealer (Tatsuya Nakadai) fight each other for supremacy. The two bosses each try to hire the deadly newcomer as a yojimbo AKA bodyguard, but the unnamed ronin has a secret plan to get rid of both of them, by playing both rivals against each other in the hope that they will wipe each other out, faster than ever. Without spoiling too much of it, this movie is a great Samurai film, that is worth the watch only. The movie is beautiful shot. Director Akira Kurosawa's films are notable for being stunning visually, with beautiful backgrounds, sometimes verging on Scenery Porn. This movie might not have much of the Japanese landscape in the background, but it made great use of the set, and the weather. The way, he know how to use actors in a wide screen frame is amazing. He place actors in the foreground. Middle ground in the left or right. Sharp focus. Director John Ford type of a style. He use the shutters and doors, well on the Japanese set to reset shots so dynamically. Without cutting the shutters and door, create a look of comic book panels, frame by frame. Like in most Kurosawa films, rainy weather is present in a few scenes, increasing the effect of the characters' discomfort making emotional seem real. The windy weather all throughout the film represents the chaotic life in the town. The wind blowing while Yojimbo walks inspired many Japanese Animes and films. Kurosawa originated a lot of film techniques that are still being used today. A form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with Kurosawa is the wipe as a transitional device. It is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the dissolve. Yojimbo had great pan-focus shots, because they were crucial to the action. Action shot with a few long shots. It's way different than how action is film, today. This is one reason this movie stands the test of time so well. One thing that the movie does so well is editing. Kurosawa was a master in that. He was so good and quick, that Yojimbo had its Japanese premiere on four days after shooting concluded. Still, the movie does have some problems, as its jump back and forth between drama and comedy. It's a bit jarring at times. Most of the humor were hits than miss. I love the look of Sanjuro AKA Yojimbo's face when he sees the dog carrying the sever hand. The violence and gore was pretty intense, at times. It's weird to see, bloody limps being chop off in an early 1960s film, seeing how strict, Japanese censors were, at the time. The cycles of violence in this film is a lot tamer than that of 1954 Seven Samurai. Yojimbo's script is pretty good, but it lacks the intellectual challenge of 1950's Rashomon, the moral resonance of 1952's Ikiru, and the sweeping grandeur of Seven Samurai. He made a couple of great samurai films, but after seeing several of them, they get to be a bit repetitive. Most of the villains are forgettable. They are two-dimensional comically idiots without a shred of redeeming humanity thought. Kurosawa told Tatsuya Nakadai that his character was a snake, so Nakadai moves very snake-like. It didn't help, as his character has little to no personality at all. I just know him, as the man with the creepy smile, snake motion and the gun. The supporting characters, he helps out aren't memorable. I was really hoping more from the old undertaker and his family. Toshiro Mifune as the main lead was great. He's not only one of the greatest Japanese actors of all-time, but is one of the greatest actors of all-time period. Toshiro Mifune is a great actor, capable of great range and subtlety of expression. A complete badass, and everybody comes to realize this very quickly. He was able to perform, the way, the director wanted to. Akira Kurosawa told Toshiro Mifune to act like a stray dog, which is why he twitches his shoulders and scratches himself a lot during the film. The character of Sanjiro can be viewed as an early example of the "Man with No Name" because he made the name up at the shot. Kurosawa was often criticized by his countrymen for perceived "arrogant" behavior, and you see that in this character. In many ways, the main lead character mirrors Kurosawa at the time. Claims of personal arrogance and harsh treatment of colleagues were often, said about the director. He could even sometimes be hard on seasoned, highly respected film professionals. During the filming of this, he lost his temper with one of Japan's preeminent cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa. He was often, very tiresome, during filming. This movie would be, one of his last best influencing films. Still, it's been years since this movie first came out, but it's still influencing how films are made today. In 1964, Yojimbo was remade as Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars, a Spaghetti Western starring Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name. Leone and his production company failed to secure the remake rights to Kurosawa's film, resulting in a lawsuit that delayed the western release for three years. The movie influenced a lot of other movies in the west over time like 1996's Walter Hill gangster film, "Last Man Standing" and others. The movie even got a sequel, 1962's Sanjuro. The music from this film by Masaru Satô is very powerful to listen to. It's often use in other films and trailers. The film is easy to find. Try to get the Criterion Collection for the best value, just note that there is no English dubbing. Overall: It's a must-watch. Will Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To watch this, wait for an evening when there'll be no interruptions, silence the phone, turn the lights down, then sit and watch the movie from beginning to end with a hot drink in your hand. You'll later rediscover it cold, having forgotten to drink it.The movie is ace. The story of a wandering Japanese samurai who happens upon a small town plagued by two warring clans. He makes it his personal job to craftily manipulate the two sides, getting them to destroy each other so that the town can be at peace again. Actually, his motive is unclear, as he seems to be doing this as a way of amusing himself as much as anything.There's a lot of production back story. The lead actor, Tishiro Mufune, was profoundly affected by the part he played, and continued to play similar roles for the rest of his career. It was also a turning point for the already accomplished director, Akira Kurosawa. There's a cute little scene where the only remaining dignified samurai in the town sneaks off over a fence rather than hang around for the action, giving Mufune a cheeky grin before strolling off into the distance. This actor was one of Kurosawa's old stalwarts - the director was signaling that the old school needed to make way for the new.Thankfully black-and-white, otherwise there would be a lot of red paint about. There is occasional chopping off of limbs and sword fights, but its down so theatrically that I don't see the movies as bloodthirsty in any way - no more than Star Wars or countless shoot-em-and-they-fall- down westerns.The only criticism I could have is to ask whether it is solely a guy's flick? My wife finds zero interest in it. There are female characters, and some key moments are when the macho tone is suddenly broken by realization that there are families trying to live lives in the shattered community. These pieces are short though, and the movie soon returns to its main themes.I could drawl on, but just wish to say that this is a good as it can get. Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' is equally excellent, but at well over three hours long can try the patience of the average movie enthusiast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Kurasawa masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurasawa is one of my favourite directors as of now. And Yojimbo does nothing to make me change that, if anything like Seven Samurai, Ran, Ikiru, Hidden Fortress, Rashomon and Throne of Blood it is another of his masterpieces. Like Hidden Fortress was a major influence on Star Wars, Yojimbo did the same for Fistful of Dollars. I've seen them compared a lot, but all I will say that for me both are milestones of their respective genres and both are movies to watch if not done so already. Back to Yojimbo, as always for a Kurasawa film, it is superbly made and made absolutely beautifully with epic scenery and great, stylish use of camera techniques. The music adds much to the story, and is remarkably atmospheric, the script is a fine mix of comedy, intrigue and sudden and quite unrelenting violence and the story is compelling and always entertaining, managing to both celebrate and subvert(but in a subtle way) the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune I have yet to see a bad performance from, and again he is a superb lead, who could be seen as an anti-hero as he sells his skills yet dupes both sides of the feudal community into slaughter. Overall, another fantastic film from perhaps the King of Japanese cinema. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched Kurosawa's Yojimbo and now I'm looking at how to watch the rest of his films.Yojimbo really changed the way I look at action movies. The whole theme of "don't look away" was good for the action, in my opinion. I feel as if the jerking, oblique and changing camera usage found in most modern action films, takes away from the action, not improving on it. There would be a single-camera throughout a whole fight scene which added to the realness of the action. I also have to say, for the fighting, the western-samurai combination was well used.The cinematography was great; Kurosawa really uses the camera to his advantage. As discussed, cinematography for the fight scenes was great a 'less-is-more' situation for me. I loved the camera angle - for when the two houses slowly approach each other, unwilling to fight - as the Samurai watches like a god from above. The camera was often far away from the subject, which gave me a feeling as if I was more in the film than any other film I've seen before.The Western feel throughout the samurai film was portrayed through its art direction. The art director did an extremely good job with the city and roads, the single-street town with the occasional tumble-weed gave off the old standoff feel. Other western elements would be with the two sides fighting against each other, and the lone-ranger only looking out for himself, and oddly the good of the people.The film has a good story line. Although, the film has a fairly predictable main story with side points that cause some confusion yet a good amount of mystery and a closer look into the main character's morals. The main character is similar to any good action movie character, quiet, strong, and with a sense of justice for the common people.Kurosawa's one of my new favorite directors; directing, Yojimbo, Seven Samurai, Ikiru, Kagemusha, and Ran. I can't wait to watch them all. I greatly recommend Yojimbo for anyone who is looking for a good action movie and doesn't have too many graphics or gives you a headache from oblique camera shots during fight scenes. Yojimbo was a great film that isn't outdated from its black and white exterior, but greatly appreciated over time for its amazing directing and a great one-of a kind, film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first sat down to watch "Yojimbo", I was under the impression that I would end up seeing just another run-of-the-mill unoriginal samurai movie... oh, how naive I was. I sat down with low, low, low low low (I mean, REALLY low) expectations. I left with a smile on my face, realizing I had never been more wrong in my life. "Yojimbo" tells the story of Sanjuro Kuwabatake... wait, no it doesn't. "Yojimbo" shows the conflict between two rival gangs ... no, that's not quite right, either. "Yojimbo" is about good vs. evil... no no no.See, no matter how I try to describe "Yojimbo", the one-line cannot begin to summarize the film. Here, let me try this: "Yojimbo" begins with Sanjuro the Samurai, travelling all by his lonesome, looking to a short wooden stick for a sense of direction. Following the stick's advice, he falls almost directly into a village-wide feud between two rival 'families'. Both families want their counterpart dead; consequently, both families want their hands on the newly arrived Sanjuro. For each of them, he symbolizes definite victory. Sanjuro sees this as an opportunity; not an opportunity to kill, but to make a lot of money. The two families begin to auction for him, and he, of course, plays hard to get. In one of the film's funniest scenes, we watch as the two families meet in the center of town; instead of charging at one another, though, they creep towards the rival army, jabbing, threatening, both far too cowardly to actually attack. Sanjuro sees this too.. he knows at that point that he has them in the palm of his hand.Ah. Even now, after those two paragraphs, I haven't even reached the point of double-triple-quadruple crosses, violence, mercy, action and inaction, captivity, torture, sex, pride -- and lack thereof -- or even retribution. I kid you not, this film has all of them, and more. It is, in it's own beautiful way, a comedy, just as Mifune is, in his own unprecedented way, a comic actor. His performance, full of mischief, mock modesty, and method, is unmatched, even in the most prevailing days of characters like Jack Sparrow.I heard one man call this film a "classic samurai action pic", but that is, in the worse way, a terrible generalization. A synonym for 'classic' is 'archetypal', and this film certainly has no archetypes. To say 'samurai action pic' is to give the idea that it is based around heart-pounding sword fights, which it certain is not; that label ignores the film's politics, dark humor, and anti-heroism. I have never seen a movie, and probably never will, quite like "Yojimbo", and that includes the Clint Eastwood remake. If you don't like subtitles, or black-and-white cinematography, or physical gags, or scenes that take their time, this is certainly not the film for you. But for me, it was a wonderful 110 minutes well-spent. I feel as if I am rambling now, and perhaps I am. But that's what this movie can do to you, especially if you're not expecting much, and end up with a cinematic gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I felt changed by this Akira Kurosawa film, the first I saw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attending a Kurosawa film festival in Los Angeles in the early seventies, I first saw "Yojimbo". I was about 20 years old. Walking out of the theater, my posture and strut affected by Toshiro Mifune's, my mind awhirl at the artistry, humor, humanity and subtlety of the film maker, I could not wait to see more. Yojimbo is a great film. Stark, funny, dangerous and imbued with Kurosawa's signature compassion and justice.The opening scene, where Mifune, as the wandering samurai, establishes his character with small gestures, and chooses his path with the toss of a stick, offers a promise that is kept. We are embarking on an adventure of unknown import and outcome, with nothing fore ordained, but in the company of strength and readiness.There are few matches in the history of cinema to equal the director Kurosawa and the actor Mifune. They are missed.No one in cinema has bettered Kurosawa in the choreography of action, and so much of what we've seen since is in his debt, but honors him poorly.You would do well to study Kurosawa's work. While it some times goes too far into the sentimental for my tastes, the whole of it is beyond compare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fistful of Excellence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film mainly because I had read it inspired one of my favorite Westerns, A Fistful of Dollars. I can say it was a pleasant experience, as Yojimbo is a remarkable movie, brilliantly directed by Akira Kurosawa.Instead of the Man With No Name, played by Clint Eastwood in the Dollar trilogy, we get Kurosawa-regular Toshiro Mifune as a nameless ronin (masterless warrior) who ends up in a village torn apart by the war between two rivaling gangs (the setting is medieval Japan, as in other movies by "the Emperor") . Tired of all the suffering he witnesses, our protagonist decides to take down both criminal groups. How? By having them destroy each other, one by one.Kurosawa brings another fundamental contribution to a genre and world he knows well with this compelling tale about greed, justice and loyalty. Even if you already know the ending, the film will keep you captivated until Mifune has delivered his last philosophical one-liner. He is very intriguing as the unidentified man who slowly but firmly restores order and peace (Eastwood would later do so too, but not with the same elegance, neither physical nor verbal).Yojimbo truly is a masterwork of Asian cinema, a powerful achievement which spawned dozens of copycats and influenced an entire career, having the same effect on Sergio Leone as Hitchcock had on Brian De Palma. Definitely worth a look if you want to see who did these things first and best.I do wonder what the Man With No Name's catchphrases would have sounded like in Japanese, though...</fullReview>

One day, he happens upon a town that he's told is divided by Seibei and Ushitora, two gangsters. Becoming Yojimbo (a bodyguard), he decides to play one against the other until the gun toting son of one of the gangsters arrives in town...The best far Eastern Western, this highly influential film is superbly directed by Kurosawa and excellently acted by Mifune. It's exciting, a joy to behold, and a visual feast throughout. And while, not the best Kurosawa film, that's more a testament to how truly great the director was than any form of indictment against this wonderful film.My Grade: A Criterion DVD Extras: Merely the theatrical trailer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Kurosawa film and the inspiration for FISTFUL OF DOLLARS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my all-time favorite Akira Kurosawa film and along with its equally impressive followup film, SANJURO, pack a ton of excitement and fun into them. Perennial Kurosawa player, Toshiro Mifune, is the "Ronin"--a wandering samurai who is looking for work. He comes to a town and is surprised by the condition of the people. There are two rival warring gangs in the town and the people are literally held captive by the mass of depraved men hired by the two leaders. These bored samurai make life all but impossible for decent people.While Mifune is a samurai with extraordinary powers, he is a lone man and must use both his skills and his brain to free the people of this town. So, he manipulates BOTH sides into thinking he's working for them and gets the bad guys to wipe each other out! This is all done through a very skillfully crafted and funny script.If you enjoy this film, as I'm sure you will, try watching Sergio Leone's version of Yokimbo--FISTFUL OF DOLLARS featuring Clint Eastwood. And, if you like this, a not-quite sequel entitled FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is an even better Kurosawa-inspired film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another masterful movie from the master of masterful movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's tribute to the western is a marvelous piece of cinema. Toshirô Mifune stars as a ronin (samurai without a master) that goes to a small town, which is divided by two gangs of criminals. While there, he decides to play one off against the other in order to defeat both gangs. Yojimbo lacks the depth of some of Kurosawa's other films, such as Rashomon or Seven Samurai, but it is, on the whole, more entertaining and much more accessible than those two mentioned films, and most of the rest of Kurosawa's oeuvre. That's not to say that Yojimbo lacks substance however; there's more than enough here to please fans of Kurosawa's other works. Just like the majority of Kurosawa's films, Yojimbo is spectacularly well filmed. The black and white cinematography looks absolutely incredible, and the some of the scenes, in particular that involve rain, are extremely atmospheric and lend the movie a great gloomy style. Toshirô Mifune's performance in this film is, in my opinion, his best. Mifune has been in some great films and given some great performances, many of them under the direction of Kurosawa; but the one here eclipses them all in my opinion. In this film, Mifune is most definitely the 'star'. In many other Kurosawa films, Seven Samurai especially, Mifune hasn't been alone, and although he isn't alone here either; he has to carry the film a lot more than he has had to with other films, and he does a great job of it. The answer to the question of whether or not he is believable in his role isn't even debatable; he is. So believable in fact that it's hard to believe that he's an actor playing a samurai, and not an actual samurai. Like a western, Yojimbo features several weird characters that add to the feel of the movie. The actors playing these smaller roles aren't as pronounced, or indeed as great as Toshirô Mifune; but they all still excel in their small roles, making the support cast a very nice ensemble indeed.Yojimbo's influence can be felt across cinema. I dread to think how great cinema might not have been if the Japanese master; Akira Kurosawa had never picked up a camera. His body of work has influenced so many styles and genres that the mind literally boggles. If he never had made a film...well, it doesn't even bear thinking about. It is well known that for one, Yojimbo was remade into Sergio Leone's 'A Fistful of Dollars', which in turn kick started Leone's career. That's just one great director we may have been without had it not been for Kurosawa. That's not all Yojimbo has had an impact on; the Spaghetti western sub-genre is littered with influence from this film, and even recent favourites such as Kill Bill have obviously taken influence from this masterpiece. Of course, cinema would be no worse off if Kill Bill was never made; but it's still credit to Yojimbo. Overall, every film fan should see Yojimbo. It's too important a film to miss, and not only that but it's guaranteed to give you 105 minutes of enjoyment. Highest recommendations from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa teams up again with Toshiro Mifune to give us a wily and cynical Ronin who enters a one horse town in conflict and sees an opportunity to make money as well as ending the conflict.The film's plot has been remade many times, most famously as a A Fistful of Dollars starring Clint Eastwood and directed by Sergio Leone.Mifune is a cunning Samurai, expert with the sword and ruthless. He is an anti hero but does show a warm nature however willing to play off the rival factions who bring misery to the small town.Mifune is the original The man with no name, a character that would become famous and forever associated with Eastwood.The film starts with a cracking pace and immediately gets to the plot with little flab before hitting the conventions dramatic plot devices that we are familiar with but this film inspired it.Mifune is terrific as the world weary ronin willing to swap sides when one of the rivals has the upper hand. He shows a devilish touch of touch of humour and although the film slackens later on, you have to see it because of its influence on cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Paradigm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's film about a wayward samurai (Toshiro Mifume), who restores balance to his world by pitting two rival gangs against each other, highlights one of his great strengths: his ability to allow all his performers to give the best performances they could give. Though "Yojimbo" ostensibly showcases the wonderful Mifume, there's plenty of room for other actors, notably Tatsuya Nakadai (as the only gunslinger in a 19th-century Japanese village), Atsushi Watanabe (as a coffin-maker) and the superb Eljiro Tono (as the saloon-keeper who serves as the film's center). The film itself is beautiful to look at (there are several great compositions) and has the feel of a new paradigm, with Mifume's very human antihero up against a realistically violent, unsavory world. Despite its setting, it has a remarkably modern feel, aided by a thoroughly modern, totally cool jazz score by Masaru Sato that pays reverence to its eastern antecedents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pure Idea of Peace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no 100% originality of men's creation. I mean that every single work of us is just an imitation of other people, so does the movie. The same thing that movie bring is the idea, and this little idea grow fast. Let's think about science-fiction idea, when we enter the world of cinema, we know that "Metropolis" is one of the first science- fiction motion pictures. Or, like "Psycho", the very first American- great-horror-film. The idea of horror, however, imitated by other movie creator, that they can make people frightened with their movie. And even the idea of the movie is basically from the experience of the creator, which is influenced by other people. With that assumption, I think that "Yojimbo" brings brand-new-soul of the movie. As note, this is my first Kurosawa's, so maybe there was another more pure idea than "Yojimbo". This new idea is the idea to impart, take sides to the truth, the "real- truth", and the deep meaning of peace. I mean the feeling when you are in safe and wealth. The thought that we must not escape the reality and keep fighting until the truth win against falsity. Yes, that idea is in many stories, but the idea to translate such a complex story to a background such as this movie is really brilliant.With one literal story, Kurosawa delivered a big deal of reality of the world explicitly also implicitly. What I always thought is two criminal family refer to two great nations of the world those days. You know, it is actually like Cold-War, when two force have great-amount of power but lack of courage to attack. I mean each side want the other side lose without being blame by another people. It can be seen clearly when two criminal families first meet and try to strike each other, but the result is nobody have guts to attack. However, every side try to rent bodyguard ("yojimbo") to defeat the other side. When the first maneuver begins, the protagonist just laugh, like some people laugh about the stupidity of Cold-War.But the idea not end just like that. With the wisdom and intelligence, The Samurai try to end the tyranny of two gangs. He knows that he is alone, I mean with some help of the restaurant owner and coffin maker, but he can seek the weak point of each side. He knows both side need money and will do anything for it, he can take advantage by this weakness. He broke out the winery and storage. Even, in the deep chaos, The Samurai still can feel compassion about other people. This is a kind of surprising idea. In the name of people's peace he sacrifices all his energy. Maybe, that person is what the world looking for. I mean the man who can end the long Cold-War, but that's just idealistic. As conclusion of the inner part of the movie is it brings new experience of crime even before the epic crime movie pops. You know is like "Batman Begins", but that movie was released 44 years after "Yojimbo". So this is an authentic one. With smart and simple twist that makes the audiences enjoy.I don't have much comment for the "packaging". What I always remembered is the suspense of the music. The battle is realistic and not "hyper- realistic". It is, in my opinion, very well directed and also critical. With the Japanese background, that you will not find in another culture, this movie is nothing but outstanding. From the purity of peace-idea and the very end of production design, "Yojimbo" is really thoughtful, entertaining, but also deep. Fantastic one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a story that will be familiar to anybody who has seen Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti western 'A Fistful of Dollars' as that film is a virtual remake of this classic samurai film! It opens with an unnamed samurai entering a town; he soon learns that there are two rival groups vying to run the place? and he decides to destroy them both and get well paid in the process by working for both sides and stirring up as much conflict as he can. All appears to be going well for him until he decides to help a man whose wife was taken by one of the gang leaders? this act of sympathy could cost the samurai his life.As a long-time fan of 'A Fistful of Dollars' I was keen to see this film; now that I have I can see why Leone decided to remake it. The story is just what you'd expect in a western except that instead of six-shooters the characters wield samurai swords. There is plenty of action as well as a surprising amount of humour. The cast does a fine job; especially Toshiro Mifune who plays the lone samurai. Director Akira Kurosawa does a fantastic job bringing the story to the screen; perfectly capturing the action and drama of the story.Overall I'd say this is a must see if you are a fan of classic films, Japanese films or even if you just want to watch a film with a good story and plenty of action!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa is easily one of the greatest storytellers of the twentieth century. His influence can be spotted in dozens of other films, often his scripts were taken lock, stock and barrel into another genre. This particular film, "The Bodyguard", was remade into a film that made Clint Eastwood a star - A Fistful of Dollars. But to be honest, I think Kurosawa's film was better, and here's why. Unlike his maniacal role in Seven Samurai, in this film Toshiro Mifune's character is calm, wry, cynical and scheming. As a solitary Samurai swordsman wandering into a village he manages to manipulate both groups of criminals against each other while taking money (and sometimes returning it) from each in turn. But in the end, it's a matter of sword against .44, old against new. Sergio Leone never managed to copy that element into his remake of a few years later.But if Kurosawa had any skill as good as his cinematography, it was his casting. The characters in his films aren't just cardboard cut-outs like many of those we see these days; they had pathos and gravitas where necessary, and despite being set in what to most westerners is an alien culture, you can see that there's always a human element to any character, something you can identify with. The town guard is an absolute treasure, as is the sceming boss's wife (ie the one who really had the brains), and Ushi-Tora's eager but dim brother. The innkeeper gets more and more annoyed and rattled as Sanjuro (Mifune) plans his next move to create havoc between the two factions. And watching them face off against each other after the fencing teacher has run for it and Sanjuro hands his money back and sits off to one side to watch is just priceless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of this tale, when our hero tosses a stick into the air to see which way it lands to choose his path, is just one of the many elements which makes this such an amazing story and one my favorites of Kurosawa's many masterpieces. What the bodyguard chooses to do first with his newfound independence is quite surprising and ambitious, like piecing together an amazingly complex jigsaw puzzle made of human nature, or staging a performance of an epic masterpiece with no previous management, production, or directing skills. But I guess he may as well tackle a mountain, since there is not much use starting small with his skills and personality. As he orchestrates the deception, our hero is much like a master puppeteer with exquisite timing and talent to incite the mayhem to achieve his goal. While the basic theme of this story is not unique - the result of greed, manipulation of others, and the changing of the world (tradition vs. progression) - many factors add an interesting and unusual charm to this film. There are plots within plots, surprising deception, perfectly paced mounting tension, unpredictable plot twists, stories within stories, distinctive and amusing characters (the big guy with his huge mallet is a lot of fun), the seemingly never-ending face offs, backstabbing, character flaws; and our hero continually placed in the perfect position to observe, listen, and evaluate. Also, the bodyguard's impeccable timing in manipulation of both sides is nice, fulfilling our expectations and keeping the story moving along. What if bodyguards were really like this? (mischievous, brilliant, manipulative) The famous people of the world would be in terrible trouble.The humor in this story is wonderful, even the macabre humor of the dog carrying the human hand in its mouth while trotting along to fairly spunky music. I also love the funnier fight sequences, which seem to come right out of clown school and resemble football skirmishes instead of battles. In several of the scenes, it appears that the swordsmen are miming roasting marshmallows instead of fighting with their weapons. Nice addition of lightness to a serious tale. Our hero sticking around after he has discontinued his services purely for "the entertainment" also accentuates the humor aspect of this movie.The mix of character types is also interesting including a dominatrix, a prodigal son, a damsel in distress, several amusing drunks, and many bumbling idiots. The ease in which our hero is able to manipulate these human beings is extremely unbelievable; however, many aspects of this film fall into that category and it is still a wonderful story. This is one of those rare instances in which certain trite, far-fetched, and predictable elements are actually good and serve to enhance the story. The nature symbolism is a nice addition to this film including the cleansing rain allowing us to shift gears from Act I to Act II, and the dust storm, which precedes the more unpredictable part of the story serving to unsettle and disorient us.Finally, the shadowy, light dancing, night fires scene is amazing, intensifying the town's debauchery and our hero finally stepping up to get involved in the action before ultimately getting caught in his own web. This scene is perfect, like an expertly lighted stage drawing us into Act III.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Yojimbo translates to bodyguard, but do not make the mistake of comparing it to the 1992 sappy mess The Bodyguard (Kevin Costner, Whitney Houston). This is one of the finest Japanese films ever made, directed by arguably the greatest Japanese director (Akira Kurosawa), and starring one of the top Japanese actors (Toshiro Mifune). It also served as the inspiration for Sergio Leone's classic 1964 western, A Fistful of Dollars (with Clint Eastwood).Based in 1860, we meet the unemployed ronin/samurai (Mifune) wandering the countryside allowing a tossed tree branch to determine the direction of his path. It leads him to a town where the ominous first visual is a dog carrying a human hand in his mouth. We realize this isn't going to be the most welcoming of towns.The town is controlled by rival factions: the Silk merchant versus the Sake brewer. They represent crime lords Seibel and Ushitora, respectively. Our clever ronin decides to play both sides against the middle and ends up hired as a bodyguard by BOTH gangs. As you can imagine, this leads to real problems for all involved.The psychology of (corrupt) power and fear is in play here, as is some dark humor (the coffin maker). The biggest clash comes with Unosuke who proudly carries the town's only pistol. He certainly enjoys the respect and power that comes with that handgun. The samurai are trained to be loyal at any cost, and it's quite interesting to see our protagonist adapt the self-preservation in his new world.Masaru Sato delivers a very unique score - one quite unusual for the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune has one of the great faces in cinematic history, and Kurosawa is in prime form. This is definitely one to see if you enjoy the best films from all countries.</fullReview>

This is one of his greatest performances. Anyone familiar with American or Italian spaghetti westerns will instantly see the story here. The loner walks into town and sees an opportunity to play both sets of bad guys against each other to make money from each. It is funny, and has lots of action as any western does. Forget any idea of foreign films when watching Mifune and Kurosawa. They are as familiar to you as films you grew up with. For great entertainment, they cannot be beat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the wonderful Kurosawas out there, "Yojimbo" was among the first I saw in my youth. For some reason I haven't revisited it since, so although I remember liking it a lot, it's as close as seeing it for the first time again as it just can be. This is my long, tedious thank-you note.Kurosawa's use of a wider aspect ratio is marvellous to watch. The frame is always rich in depth and motion, and often there is a rich supply of action not only in horizontal space but at the same time also either in the background or foreground. He likes to shoot intimately, shooting from afar but zooming in. I know I'm going to go to "Sanjuro" next, but I truly have to revisit the hidden fortress, his first film not shot in 4:3.And amazing use of music! It not only participates in what we see, it's sublimely ironic and truly a character of its own. This sly sense of irony permeates the whole film, and in effect there's hardly any need to justify or moralize. The action is violent, aggressive and remarkably fast-paced, and it bursts so suddenly and effectively that requires immense skill to build up to. And his escape from confinement, crawling under the r&#x14d;ka (the corridor) creates a thrilling spatial restraint and actually manages to make the footsteps of the running enemies truly hostile. The violence of the wind takes on Sjöström's utterly bellicose "The Wind" (1928)."Yojimbo" is so expertly crafted, so alive and full of wonders it's a treasure chest of cinema to cherish. I'm sure I'll not let the next visit linger on as long as it did last time.</fullReview>

The setting is typically western with the town consisting of businesses lining a central road and much of the plot follows a western blueprint, leading up to a final showdown in the center of town. It's not just the plot that is transferred over to "A Fistful of Dollars", but much of the look and visual style of the film is also adopted. The characters seem to come from somewhere else though. The film is a loose adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's "Red Harvest", and that novel's gangster characters seem to have been dropped into the western/samurai setting. The cross-genre blending is brilliant, allowing for new heights of cynicism and black comedy in the samurai, and ultimately the western, genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Samurai Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent and exciting samurai movie starring Toshiro Mifune as a clever ronin, who tries to save a town from two rivaling gangs by playing them against each other.Mifuni gave a solid performance as the sword-wielding samurai, providing much action and humor in a film full of drama and twists. Each and every actor gave a very memorable performance, creating an eerie atmosphere that makes the movie unpredictable, but memorizing at the same time. It is fun to watch Mifuni's methods of operation as he deals with the two gangs, thinking what kind of cards to play to get them to defeat each other.I haven't seen much of director Akira Kurosawa's work, but he surely did a great job in directing this film. It is not too long, not too short, but just right, filmed in a pace that will keep the audience engaged. Masaru Sato's haunting music score was perfect for this movie.This surely is one of my favorite action movies; all action movie lovers will be, I believe, thoroughly entertained by this feature.Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Kurosawa centred around one great performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yojimbo is one of Akira Kurosawa's most celebrated films in his career and was remade by Sergio Leone into A Fistful of Dollars. It is considered an essential film and a classic in the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune was excellent as the nameless ronin who sets out to protect the town, being a man of few words. Kurosawa is of course excellent at setting up the conflict in the town and how it affects the people whilst also delivering on fine samurai sword fights (a man even has his hand cut off). Kurosawa wonderfully lets his scenes play out with plenty of long shots and small camera movements. Kurosawa and his actors also inject some occasional moments of humours to help lighten the mood when need be. But for the most Yojimbo is a serious drama with some very dark elements. Out of the Kurosawa films I have seen I personally prefer Seven Samurai for its scale and Rashomon for its ambition, but Yojimbo is still a worthy film and true film buffs need to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yojimbo is one of the earliest and most influential action movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am new to Akira Kurasova's movies. I have heard so much great things from his movies, mainly from Seven Samurai. I will watch that later on especially after the amazement that I experienced by watching 'Yojimbo'.Yojimbo is one of the most original and earliest action movies directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, the Japanese Akira Kurasova. The film centers around a samurai without a master that wanders into a village that is separated and ruled by crime gangs: Inokichi, Ushitori and an aging Seibei. This mysterious Samurai walks into this town and decides to make a profit out of this by cleaning out the crime in this town, all the time, receiving money.Yojimbo is easily one of the most influential movies ever made with Sergio Leone, 3 years later, making a Spaghetti Western of the same movie called 'A Fistful of Dollars' The movie is just so likable and simply so entertaining to watch despite having to read subtitles the whole time. The movie has amazing music, perhaps some of the most epic I've ever heard, entertainingly and well written dialogue which has to be amazing since I was reading subtitles, by the look of it, great acting, an amazing story and such great characters.The action scenes in the movie didn't bother me. I was entertained. They don't look the most convincing but an amazing soundtrack, as present during these action scenes, easily makes me forget about the minor issue.Overall, 'Yojimbo' is a masterpiece in terms of movie history and should be watched by far more people. It is one of the earliest and most amazing action movies and even to this day, is still surprisingly watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of Kurosawa's most brilliant films. You can't miss it. There are elements of all the classical film storytelling: action, suspense, drama, mystery, Once you watch this movie, every other Kurosawa movie gains a different angle. Here he shows why he is Japan's most celebrated film maker. Even with the technical limitations of the time, he was able to portray a story that is old and surprisingly modern at the same time. This is not an easy task to accomplish, but he did so masterfully in this movie. Toshiro Mifume, who is present in many of Kurosawa's movies, plays impeccably the role of Sanjuro, a samurai without a lord. His confrontation with the gangster Unosuke sets the stage for this beautiful drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Samurai Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A crafty ronin (samurai with no master) comes to a town divided by two criminal gangs and decides to play them against each other to free the town.The film's look and themes were in part inspired by the western film genre, in particular the films of John Ford. Kurosawa was also inspired by two Dashiell Hammett noir novels from 1929 and 1931. In 1964, "Yojimbo" was remade as "A Fistful of Dollars", a spaghetti western directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood... I love that American westerns inspired Japanese samurai films, which in turn inspired Italian westerns. Who would expect westerns to take such a detour? This film has awesome music, plenty of action, and even some humor (such as when the men are running around trying to catch the leaky sake). This is quite possibly Kurosawa's finest film. Unfortunately, too few people will see it (at least in America) because foreign films require too much patience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yojimbo is a period drama directed by Akira Kurosawa. It tells the story of a ronin, portrayed by Toshir&#x14d; Mifune, who arrives in a small town where competing crime lords vie for supremacy. The two bosses each try to hire the deadly newcomer as a bodyguard.Tatsuya Nakadai,Yôko Tsukasa and Isuzu Yamada to play key supporting roles.Mifune portrays a Samurai who finds himself in the middle of a feud-torn Japanese village. Neither side is particularly honorable, but Mifune is hungry and impoverished, so he agrees to work as bodyguard for a silk merchant against a sake merchant. He then pretends to go to work for the other, the better to let the enemies tear each other apart. Imprisoned for his "treachery," he escapes just in time to watch the two warring sides wipe each other out. This was his plan all along, and now that peace has been restored, he leaves the village for further exploits. This film is a rousing and good story, told with vigor and visual excitement by Kurosawa, and splendidly acted by Toshiro Mifune.Added to that,it engages viewers with its larger than life protagonist and easy to follow narrative.But the biggest impression left by Yojimbo is the characterization of Sanjuro, whose iconography of stoic cool that inspired Clint Eastwood's anti-heroic "Man with No Name" is consistently undercut with dashes of comical realism.Yes, Yojimbo was the prototype for the Clint Eastwood character in the movie,A Fistful of Dollars. The difference is that Fistful relies on Eastwood for its success, whereas Yojimbo scores on every creative level, from director Akira Kurosawa to cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa to Mifune's classic lead performance.Finally,this film works at all level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kurosawa, like Kubrick, is one of those directors whose movies look better today than when they were released. This film, for instance, clearly shows its influences, as previously mentioned, Tarantino films have a great deal of influence from this single piece alone. And this film is as good as anything Tarantino done, including Pulp Fiction.I was also impressed by a greater degree by this film than Seven Samurai, which is another excellent film. However, this one benefits from being made 7 years later, Kurosawa probably had a bigger budget and the quality of the cinematography has greatly improved (at least from the versions that I have watched).Highly recommended to anybody who likes a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that the leading character in Yojinbo sees as he arrives in an unknown city is a dog with a human hand in his mouth. It's clear from the very beginning what kind of place it is - lonely and violent. One could easily replace it for one of the cities we're used to see in American westerns. A long dirty road with houses, saloons and shops on both sides. An image of post-apocalypse in a civilized world.The main character, best known simply as Samurai, is played by one of Kurosawa's favorites, Toshiro Mifune. Here he is a man with certain skills that allow him to be someone both sides would like to have on their side. Someone they're ready to pay a lot of money to have him on their side. He knows it and plans to use it. The trouble comes when a gunslinger comes to town. He is far more suspicious and much more feared than others. The Samurai is not too worried with him at first, as he knows he is a better killer, but he underestimates how things can easily turn out to be completely different from what he expected if only someone would rock the boat a bit. ------- ''''SPOILER'''' ------ And the person who eventually does it turns out to be he him self, his empathy, to be exact.Yojimbo is a very complexed story presented more as an action movie than a historical drama like some other Kurosawa's work including Seven Samurai and even something newer like Kagemusha, Ran etc. However, that does not make it less important or worse. To contrary, it's one of Kurosawa's most entertaining movies with a lot more hiding under the surface. I'd definitely recommend it to everyone. Whether you're an average viewer or a movie buff, this is definitely a movie that has the quality to please both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well. This was my first Kurosawa film by now... but will definitely not be my last one! Let me first say this: Instead of going into town, I decided to stay home alone and watch this movie. And now afterwards I must say: It was totally worth it! The camera in this movie turns very slowly and the screens stay focus on pictures for a long time, also the movie actually lasts two hours - but altogether comes down in a flash, as so it only were 10 minutes. Do not get bothered about that this is a black/white movie, this actually gives it the right flare and impression. This movie does not need colors, or let me put it this way: the black and white colors simply fit to the storyline. Well, the storyline: Classic and awesome. The good old lonely, silent, mystified hero against the whole world. Characters really are deep and all of them their own kind, as you haven't seen them in another movie of this kind yet.10 Stars from me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite an excellent classic of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that even today gets recommended among the youngsters, even though the movie is from two plus generations back.Yojimbo is a story of a ronin from the fifteenth century who comes to a town that's torn between two local gangs. The ronin decides to clean the place up by attempting to set the gangs against each other as much as possible.The story is not always prefect and there are a few "yeah, right, like that would ever happen" moments in the plot, but it's rather interesting that things don't go just the way the viewer expects. The main character, for one, isn't given all the extreme luck and super abilities that spaghetti heroes like him often receive from the makers.The movie is somewhat comical, with the accent put on the silliness of the criminal element. A fair classification would be a comical Western...Excuse me, "Eastern" would be a more correct term.The characters are all slightly exaggerated. The evil smart man has an evil smile and an advantage; the stupid man has the unibrow and the arrogance; the cowards are pacing and have a scared look on their face. This all, however, makes the movie all that more colorful and doesn't feel as cheesy as in other movies with similar exaggeration.Camera work is close to perfect. Positions are very well chosen and nothing feels out of place (unless you do not feel the intention of the director). There are a few hidden meanings and interesting decisions. As one could expect, this movie isn't a special effects galore. However, where gore or destruction comes, it looks realistic yet not over the top. The music is well synchronized with the action and is mostly of a comic tune.The final verdict is that Yojimbo is a movie that's very interesting to watch. It owes this to the story, the actors, the music and just plain good movie directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply one of the coolest movies ever made. Tight, beautifully edited, sharp, funny and action packed - its been copied many times, but rarely matched.What a lot of people miss about this movie is the darkness of the comedy - there are multiple references here to what Kurosawa saw as the corruption of post war Japanese society - especially the relations of the merchants (corporations) and the gangsters (yakuza). In showing the hero as almost as cynical as the bad guys - and refusing to give the bad guys any redeeming features this is actually a movie that is dark and pessimistic in a way that goes far beyond the many imitators. But somehow, it is still funny and riveting to watch. It also has one of the most effective soundtracks of any movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

I have probably seen this movie a hundred times, it is one of my favorites, and I have always had that feeling that it reminded me of something, then finally tonight it came to me.

		<shortDescription>"You can't get rich unless you're known to be a cheat and a killer"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A year before Yojimbo, Kurosawa made a film called The Bad Sleep Well. A savage indictment of corporate and governmental corruption, it was a disappointment to audiences because of its downbeat (yet realistic) ending, and a disappointment to Kurosawa because he couldn't safely go as far as he wanted to in his critique. With Yojimbo, he solved both problems by doing a lose remake in a period setting.The world of Yojimbo is as full of corruption, betrayal and heartlessness as any Film Noir. The two merchants Tokuemon and Tazaemon are powerful yet decadent and, as their names suggest, there is little to choose between them. The town guard is a weak, toadying little man, and the government inspector grows rich from bribes. The hired killers of Seibei and Ushi-Tora represent the gangsters of modern Japan ? a common target of Kurosawa's, but here the link between them and the establishment is made explicit. However, because it was staged as a Samurai action flick, Kurosawa was able to have this rogues gallery of bad guys wiped out by an invincible hero, giving the audience the satisfaction they would be denied in a straight, contemporary drama.But the allegory wasn't the only item on Kurosawa's agenda. As in his previous Samurai films, he was always looking to reinvent the Japanese period film, in particular to move away from the rigid moralism and ritual of the feudal setting. However, if Seven Samurai only pushed the conventions of the genre, Yojimbo leaves them in tatters. Once again, the hero is a masterless Samurai, the lowest of the low in feudal Japan ? but Sanjuro doesn't care, and isn't interested in regaining his honour. He's content to be a drifter and a mercenary. He is to the typical Samurai hero what Sam Spade (from The Maltese Falcon) is to Sherlock Holmes.In the Bad Sleep Well, a kind of satirical cartoonishness was starting to creep into Kurosawa's work. In Yojimbo this is exaggerated even further, with Kurosawa picking the most grotesque and freakish looking character actors to play the mobsters and bloated authority figures. Unosuke, played by Tatsuya Nakadai (who was to become a Kurosawa regular, and would eventually replace Toshiro Mifune as his lead man), makes a brilliantly psychotic arch villain. For the most part though, the bad guys are simply made to look ridiculous, and Yojimbo does have elements of comedy about it. Sanjuro on the other hand, is calm, collected and somewhat aloof, a role Mifune (now a mature actor in his 40's) was ideally suited to. Kurosawa has him as a passive, silent observer through most of the picture. However, as is revealed in the scene where he watches the two opposing from the top of the watchtower, he is really the puppet master of the story.Kurosawa's direction is tight as ever. This was his best use of the 'scope aspect ratio yet. He organises some brilliant shots of the two opposing gangs, showing them as almost identical. There's also some self-reference of the short, wide aspect ratio, with Sanjuro peering through narrow window slits, further reinforcing the idea that he is an observer. There's a great use of percussive noises ? the guard bashing his sticks together, gunshots, not to mention the music ? which give the whole film a tense kind of rhythm.One of my favourite things about Yojimbo is the way the scenario gradually builds up and becomes more intense as the film progresses. There's an eerie calm at the beginning, and when we first see the gangs face each other they are reluctant to fight and just make gestures and threats. Then, as Sanjuro and Unosuke become involved everything becomes more and more chaotic, with killings, double crossings and eventually huge massacres taking place. When Sanjuro returns for the final showdown with the Ushi-Tora gang the tension is incredible. Every shot and every edit at this point is perfect, and I'd say it's one of the best scenes Kurosawa ever directed.Also worth a brief mention is the rain. Kurosawa was famous for his use of rain, but not only did he use it a lot, he also uses it very differently to the average director. Whereas the rain device is often employed rather obviously for a sad moment or pivotal scene, Kurosawa uses it much subtly and Yojimbo is one of the best examples. When the inspector visits, everyone stops fighting and it begins to rain. Because of the weather, it reminds me more than anything of a stoppage of play during a sports match, or kids having to play indoors on a rainy day ? very suitable for the tone of the film at this point.In mixing his social allegory with tense action and pure fun, Kurosawa came up with a winning formula, and this is among his strongest and most enjoyable films.</fullReview>

From the very outset when the son of a farmer told his father that he is not going to eat the ordinary food all his life till the end when he was told by the Yojimbo that it is better to eat then to die. Each and everything needs a special praise and all is done very masterly. We can see Kurosawa stamp all over the movie specially the rain seen, that is just brilliant. From dialogs to acting, production to direction and very unusual for Kurosawa movie music is spot on in fact very good.

		<shortDescription>A Machiavellian western in medieval Japan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Scientific American (Feb. 1998) John R. Hale wrote: "Plato may have denied the existence of ideal forms in this world, but Plato never saw a Viking ship." In fact, Plato had several disadvantages: he saw the Parthenon, of course; but he never listened to JS Bach, and he never tasted Islay whisky; most relevant here is that Plato never saw a Japanese sword.If there is a better way to appreciate the Japanese sword than to see this movie, I don't know it. The choreography of the sword-fights might not be the best, and the black+white photography is a drawback in the action scenes; but no other movie builds tension more effectively, and without tension, no action scene can be fully appreciated.When I first saw this movie, I had already seen two other samurai movies by Kurosawa. That gave me a superficial familiarity with medieval Japan (as seen by Kurosawa), so that I could focus on the plot, the characters, and the action, without having to worry about the unfamiliar setting. Now I have seen this movie often enough to follow it without subtitles, enjoy the sound of the Japanese dialog (without understanding it), and still know from memory what is going on.The highlights of this movie are the three sword-fights, with Sanjuro, alone, facing overwhelming odds. When the third sword-fight comes, you'll know right away that it's going to be the last. It is a classic western-style showdown, with Sanjuro and the bad guys facing each other on a dusty, wind-swept main street in a Japanese village. When I first saw the set-up, I could not help giggling to myself in eager anticipation; and I was not disappointed. Yet the first sword-fight is perhaps the most impressive, for its explosive violence and the terror that suddenly strikes the heart of Sanjuro's enemies.Having said that, it would be very wrong to conclude that the movie is just an excuse for a few action scenes: the other major theme is the Machiavellian plot to clean up the village. Sanjuro explains this plot early on to the innkeeper: he cannot eliminate all the gangsters single-handed, so he'll set them against each other. The success of this plan depends crucially on persuading the gang leaders that Sanjuro is only interested in the money: if they realized that his goal is to clean up the town, the plot would collapse.This movie was somewhat more enjoyable than The Seven Samurai for me: partly because I saw The Seven Samurai when I was not yet comfortable with the setting in medieval Japan; partly because in this movie the interludes between action scenes are shorter, and the action scenes generally better. However, there cannot be a real comparison, because The Seven Samurai is mostly a study of the title characters, while Yojimbo is more about plot than character development. The seven samurai hardly ever interact with the bad guys, except by violence; Yojimbo lives amongst the bad guys. Ultimately, both movies are masterpieces in different ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man between two parties accurate absurd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pass and years go by, and gives the impression that life scenarios follow-removable rotating one wheel. We learn, but do not exercise, much less self-critical to reflect on what shows daily existence. Technology advances, it becomes science, we have more and more glimpses of the vastness and power of the universe, but about living, about love, solidarity and respect, we still know very little. And if this is little we know, everything else will help very little to our long-awaited happiness. When you see "Yojimbo," a movie filmed in 1961 and set in the nineteenth century, immediately feel that you are recreating life in the most marginalized neighborhoods of today (in microseconds) and the worst- governed countries (in macro). Akira Kurosawa, with his usual vigor and with that singular narrative black and white, reflecting the stories of the past, and he also uses for his known respect to which Japan considers permanent colors, tells a story that is very common among us: Two sides unscrupulous careerists, face one another for domination of a people. One is supported by the manufacturer of silk and the other the brewery. The police chief serves their interests, the coffin maker is hungry for bodies to evacuate its raw material, and among the people hiding fearing each day in the midst of scarcity and constantly fearing for their lives than to anyone matter.But as ever we are definitely alone, a man, a yojimbo (bodyguard), a powerful samurai warrior who feels he must play their part in that fateful battle front, enters the scene to see if he can avoid the shadows. And then, in an accurate reflection of a shameful and eternal reality, many things happen like that usually happen in men more absurd and blind. While these go to his traps, his brutality and obsessive siege, the people's side is no place for friendship, for faith in the other, and the exercise of solidarity, cunning and perseverance. Kurosawa makes us nod. Her film, half comic and half tragic, a western and as much as jeki jidai; remembered aspect, but inevitably present, has the smell of eloquent film, backed by a dense, neat art that deserves our applause and our greatest appreciation.And Toshiro Mifune is confirmed as a powerful actor histrionics, whose international success, and his constant presence in the films of the great Japanese master, was by no means a matter of influence, and yes, the deserved harvest of a committed and professional work as more. "Yojimbo" is opening the gap of Eastern cinema that deserves many, many more spaces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death in the Dust and the Wind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it lacks the scope of THE SEVEN SAMURAI, THRONE OF BLOOD, and other more widely known films by the celebrated Akira Kurosawa, the 1961 YOJIMBO (also known as BODYGUARD) is one of the most important films of the second half of the 20th Century--and a film that was deeply influenced by American film. Even so, YOJIMBO stands on its own merits: it's a magnificent piece of cinema that will fascinate even those who normally turn up their noses at "movies with subtitles." In theory, the film is based on the 1929 Dashiell Hammett novel RED HARVEST--but transports the basic story to a period in Japan when the Samurai class has fallen on hard times and must seek employment as common body guards. Sanjuro Kuwabatake (brilliantly played by Toshiro Mifune, who appeared in several Kurosawa films) is such a one, a scruffy looking and aging warrior who finds himself caught between warring factions of a Japanese village and responds by playing the two against each other.One of the film's greatest assets is its visual style. Kurosawa is very clearly influenced by the look of the American western here, and most particularly so, in my opinion, by HIGH NOON. Consequently, YOJIMBO leaps the cultural divide with considerable ease--but Kurosawa uses the images of empty streets and the lone warrior to considerably different effect, presenting him as a dangerous figure who emerges from the dust and the wind to rip wide his foes. But the film does not rely on visual style alone: there is plenty of hard substance here, too. The plot is tightly wound, action-intensive, and laced with a dry and very black humor, and the cast is superlative throughout.As it borrowed from the American movie western, so did it influence American film in return, most obviously in the form of the popular Clint Eastwood "spaghetti westerns" of the 1970s--where it was essentially remade as A FIST FULL OF DOLLARS. But frankly Clint Eastwood never had it so good: with Kurosawa at the helm and Mifune as the lead, Eastwood's "lone stranger" feels mighty tame in comparison.The Criterion DVD offers the film in original widescreen and in the best possible condition short of a full digital restoration. As noted elsewhere, there are occasional blips and lines--but honestly the film is so driving that you will barely notice them. The subtitles also seem to be a better translation than I've seen in any other version. YOJIMBO was my introduction to Japanese cinema. I urge you to let it be yours as well.Gary F.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie, With Kurosawa &amp; Mifune In Top Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune both in top form, "Yojimbo" is one of their most enjoyable and interesting movies. The story and the characters are both fun to watch, and there is a lot of action, which also is by no means without some substance.The intriguing setup gets things off to a great start. As Mifune's character learns what is going on in the town, you can almost see his mind at work, calculating how to play off one gang against the other. The story itself offers lots of good turns with plenty of good action sequences, and the ideas behind the story are interesting as well. Mifune's character is not just a master swordsman, but also a clever psychologist, and the various plot turns provide an interesting, cynical, and amusing look at human nature.All of that takes place against some nicely-crafted settings and scenery that have a lot of interesting detail, plus a musical score that complements the action quite well. In fact, everything about the movie is fun to watch. It all seems so effortless, and yet it is really the result of some master craftsmen at work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Seven Samurai</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Kurosawa at his best. I know that most people would find Seven Samurai to be the best, the trademark of Japanese filmography and Akira Kurosawa, but I still think that place belongs to Jojimbo. The last fight in this picture gives you such an intensity rarely seen anywhere else. One of ten best pictures ever made, in my opinion, that is. Also, made in black and white picture also gives you that certain charm modern films don't have anymore. Plenty of symbols there as well, the traditional Japanese ex Samurai, now a Ronin, and the local villain with the revolver, a new revolutionary weapon in their world, start of an Industrial age that will slowly change Japan in years to come /years later idea completely stolen for the basic plot of the movie about the only survivor of the Hollywood mental and physical genocide of Japanese warriors- The Last Samurai/Tom Cruise/ Jojimbo A must see picture!Cheers, Byxl, Sarajevo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, Kurosawa's 1961 film "Yojimbo" - about a skilled samurai who comes to a town and plays its two gangs against each other - is superior to the (still great) "Shichinin no Samurai". I say this because, for one thing "Shichinin no Samurai" is three and a half hours long, which is a little hard to watch if you have to read the whole thing (not Japanese). Secondly, the choreography of the fight scenes in "Yojimbo" is FAR better than the ones in "Shichinin no Samurai". In "Yojimbo" the fight scenes are fast and skilled, while in "Shichinin" they were more chaotic and hard to watch. The 1954 movie was still very well done and exciting to watch, don't get me wrong.Anyway, all comparisons aside, "Yojimbo" is great work. The plot is very interesting, and the script shines with much action and dark humor. I guess I'm in no place to say how good the acting was (not Japanese), but it's sure as hell better then most of the stuff out these days.Another thing worth mentioning is the fight scenes. Like old westerns, there aren't many, but when they show up they're super cool. Toshiro Mifune's character - one of the coolest I've seen - is so skilled with that sword. Its awesome, especially in the scene where he finishes off six guards...by himself.I'd have to say the one thing that kind of ruined it for me was having seen "Last Man Standing" (the stupid Hollywood version) beforehand. I knew what would happen next, and that sucked. I advise for anyone wanting to see this movie NOT to watch "Last Man Standing" first.So, if you're looking for an epic adventure about bravery...watch "Shichinin no Samurai", but if you want a dark, edgy, cool tale, rent "Yojimbo", now.8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After "Unforgiven," I'd say this is the second-best Western I've ever seen. And yeah, I'm calling it a Western.DO NOT judge this film off "A Fistful of Dollars." In fact, if at all possible, avoid seeing "A Fistful of Dollars" first. Leone made a very inferior version, and it will taint your enjoyment of "Yojimbo."Toshiro Mifune is one of the greatest actors I've ever seen. His athleticism and physical presence are pure bonus, because this guy can really act too. He plays a great anti-hero role in this film. Even when other actors are delivering lines, I find myself watching Mifune's expressions... he's able to convey exactly what his character is thinking without having to say a word.The plot, directing, acting, cinematography, musical score, etc. are all superb.It's really close to a 10/10, but I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kurosawa. What hasn't been said about the man already? Arguebly the greatest director of the 20th century, Yojimbo further solidifies his iconic position. Much like Scorsese and de Niro years later, Kurosawa teams up again with Toshiro Mifune to give us Sanjuro, a cynical ronin who has no qualms about using other people for his own selfish goals.The movie begins with Sanjuro wandering the countryside without purpose. By chance, he walks into a town being torn apart because of two warring criminal clans trying to wipe each other out. Demonstrating his skill at swordmansship, both attempt to hire Sanjuro in their war. But, Sanjuro has his own plans...Mifune's performance is a complete 180 in relation to his role in Seven Samurai. No longer the bumbling buffoon, Mifune displays a cunning and cold-hearted nature which goes a long ways to getting what he wants. The anti-hero portrayal will influence movie characters like Eastwood's The Man with No Name, Han Solo and Snake Plissken for years to come. Hearing the main musical theme and watching the opening shot where the camera follows him from behind makes one realize he is not a man to be trifled with.Yojimbo is a great start to get familiar with Kurosawa. A great story, characters and acting fuse together like few other films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dumb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the world, there are people who should not comment on anything. Especially those who call things 'boring', or 'a bore', or 'long and drawn out, couldn't stay awake... put it off after ten minutes (this is the @#$@# most stupid comment of them all'...) these people should avoid all commentary, because such comments do not make for a valid statement, are very far from any critical process, and should be thrown out to the street and stepped on, like the own egos who created them. Who could ever find such opinions useful? But of course, this world is far from ideal, far from intelligent, full of idiocy, 'there is no hope for fools' as Mifune once acted. It is true, people are fools. We all are most of the times, but most are always. Thus, we get fools commenting, usually at their most foolish point, writing their own minute visions of 'art' haphazardly, (it's a wonder how they can be so reckless with such simplistic concepts roaming their heads) repeating words like 'junk', and 'waste of my time'... exactly, life is a waste of their time. That's for sure. 'So... you don't mind if I kill you now?' (As Mifune once acted). This movie is a wonderful, universal film. Not at all perfect... (which encumbers a whole nother set of nauseating remarks such as 'perfect film... flawless...unbeatable plot...'). But who wants perfect!? Universal is key and most important here, forget all those people who mistook Kurosawa in Japan... Japan is like all societies, full of idiots, full of close-minded people looking for an ideal, trying to be their own geniuses. Don't need none of that. Done need 'isolationism', 'nationalism', 'my word is right' 'the dogma' 'follow the tradition to the bone or you are a traitor'... And by saying all this, I am basically trying to show what this movie is about. The weakness of all opinion, the fall of all sides without perspective. Only the genius, he who is capable of abstraction, who can analyze behind all notions of bad and good, will withstand time, will survive. None of the rest matters. All of the rest destroys itself, annihilates itself, and could is better off dead... the sooner the better, in fact. Whoever thinks that Kurosawa wrote about the honor of the samurai as a historical institution, is missing the fact that many of his films play on the samurai who to survive must deviate from all known feeling of honor, especially in a film like this, whose premise and character, Sanjuro, represents the 'decadence' of the samurai tradition... A most important aspect - perhaps the only underlying aspect - of the film, stated even before the first dialog appears. This is not a movie about good and evil, about honor and shame... universality goes far beyond this. He who sees the big picture has the gift of immortality, of being universal. This is a movie that, in a very humble, concise and attractive way, exemplifies such artistic ideals, giving an unrealistic power to a man who is more than man. The most beautiful and harrowing aspect of Sanjuro for the townspeople, is that he is his own bodyguard. He is endowed with this poetic perfection, which nobody else has... he almost doesn't exist for them (he is absent during all revenges), because this is unfathomable to everyone in the town. He is God. He is just, brings justice, above all notions of justice. This movie defeats all people who find it boring, and all who could possibly revere it to death, me included. It exists alone. It is it's own nomad. It walks behind us all. Behind anything we could muster up saying about it to describe it. I'm also a fool for writing this comment. The only thing not foolish is watching the film, arriving at that town the way Kurosawa intended us to, without any previous knowledge or prejudice, where there is no good or evil, just people doing what they usually do, think they and only they are right, where things aren't anything that they seem, but at the same time, are only what they appear to be... ruins. To be able to do this, to see it in this way as a viewer, is already a feat. Don't get bored just yet, don't cry out it's genius. Try to be a viewer, make that effort. It's an ideal, I know... it may be forever impossible. But I guess it could also make for a better person in you.</fullReview>

They're both in black and white, and not as fast paced as today's 2fast 2forgettable garbage, but they're both far more entertaining, immersive and intense. Every moment has its purpose, every action a reaction. This is the lost art of film. Also, go watch all of Kurosawa's other movies, particularly "Rashomon", "The Hidden Fortress", and "Ran". Take a look at his movie listing and observe all the movies that were made with his scripts in other countries. Make sure you vote for "The Seven Samurai" after you watch it, those -lame by comparison- Lord of the Rings movies have been pushing it back from it's rightful place in the top 250 movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yojimbo, which was ?remade' three years later and only slightly different as Per un pugno di dollari (which I will refer to as A Fistful of Dollars from here on), is a really impressive piece of film-making. Made back in 1961, it is obvious the Japanese not only had quality actors, but also at least one good director. The story itself had not much surprises for me, since I've seen A Fistful of Dollars about five times and since that film is almost an exact copy of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo. Still I enjoyed watching Yojimbo, because it combined good acting, an amazingly modern score for its time and good directing. Toshirô Mifune (most famous perhaps for his leading role in the mini series Shogun) plays the main character in Yojimbo, who is just as cool and has just as many one-liners as Eastwood in the ?remake'. The only difference between Eastwood and Mifune would be that the latter one does not smoke. Even some of the gestures that Eastwood's character had in A fistful of Dollars are similar to the ones Mifune had in this film. It is almost surreal how much these films have in common. The films are equally well made and equally good as far as I am concerned, except maybe that there was no qualitative equivalent to Gian Maria Volonté in this film. The only real difference I could find between the two films, was that Yojimbo is a bit more ?brutal' than A Fistful of Dollars (watch what the dog has between his teeth in both films). All in all, this is a pretty good film and certainly one that has earned his place in cinema history. I for one will go and try to consume more of Kurosawa's films and maybe you should go and see if you can dig up Yojimbo or another one of his films as well. 7,5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Man with No Name !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Yojimbo' was Kurosawa's most commercially successful film in his home country of Japan. Now some critics and viewers tend to justify this commercial success by calling the film an entertaining action film without much substance. But after having watched it for the 3rd time in a matter of a year, I will have to disagree with that opinion. Yes, the film is very entertaining, but the screenplay written by Kurosawa and Ryuzo Kikushima is deceptively deep and meaningful.The first and foremost thing that has to be understood about 'Yojimbo' is that the film is a dark comedy. Kurosawa actually wants to generate some humour out of potentially gruesome and depressing moments. Thematically, the film is all about Kurosawa's wish fulfillment. The character of Sanjuro is Kurosawa's surrogate. Sanjuro executes the things that Kurosawa himself wants. This is the reason why this character is not completely realistic. He is supposed to be a mythic figure, a wandering spirit. This mysterious, rugged outsider character that becomes entangled in something that he has little vested interest in, has a very iconic place in cinema history. On one hand, this character of Sanjuro itself was inspired by some of the rugged cowboy characters in American Western films that Kurosawa was an admirer of. On the other hand, this character has further inspired some of the most iconic characters that came later like Clint Eastwood's 'Man with no name' character in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns and the character of Mad Max in George Miller's films to name a few.Story-wise, Kurosawa is using a period setting to mirror the condition of the Japanese economy at the time the film was made. Sanjuro in the film randomly walks into a town that looks desolate, grim and depressing. The town is run by two rival gangster groups who work in close coalition with two rival business merchants. The merchants require the gangsters for the muscle and the gangsters require the merchants and their money for their existence. This greatly mirrors the social scenario in Japan during the economic boom. The businessmen and politicians brought in an age of unrestricted capitalism with extensive and undeniable help from the Yakuza. Kurosawa is clearly going back to the past to throw some light on the present. He is using Sanjuro to express his philosophies and comment against this unchecked spread of rampant consumerism. In a way Kurosawa is rewriting history. In a factual sense, the samurai class disappeared and the era of the merchants and the gangsters started in Japan. But in his fantasy version of history, Kurosawa has Sanjuro the Samurai come back from the cemetery and defeat the gangsters and thematically clean the town.The cinematography in the film to some extent makes the film for me. The telephoto lens works overtime to give us these gorgeous frames. When it comes to frame composition and expressive blocking of actors, Kurosawa is second to none. The wide angle photography of Kurosawa and cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa is awe-inspiring. The exterior shots in the street are epic in scope. Kurosawa uses wind machines to crank up the epic nature of the outdoor standoff scenes. Kurosawa's style of shooting the action scenes is actually quite simple. He doesn't use fast editing like one sees in a lot of action films. He generally uses two diagonally placed cameras to capture the shots and relies heavily on choreography. Kurosawa's use of Masaru Sato's music is also brilliant. He choreographs the movements of the characters in certain scenes to the beat of the music which adds a poetic touch to the visuals. Toshirô Mifune pretty much owns the screen in the film. He exudes gravitas and authority. He is charming, witty, suave and when required viciously aggressive. Mifune adds an immensely masculine charisma to the film. It was great watching him manipulate the rival gangs and direct the proceedings. Tatsuya Nakadai is great as the primary nemesis of Mifune. Nakadai's character carries with a long barrel pistol almost like a phallic symbol to represent this power. He too is very charismatic with the twinkle in his eye and threatening demeanour.'Yojimbo' might not have as much complexity as Kurosawa's other masterpieces like 'Rashomon' or 'Red Beard', but it still has something to say and comment upon. Kurosawa's brilliant filmmaking enhances and elevates the screenplay to the next level and makes this a must watch. This is certainly one of his best films. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had sen this Japanese film listed in the television schedules a number of times, always on the same channel, Film4, it is rated five out of five stars by critics, so I decided it was definitely worth a watch, directed by Akira Kurosawa (Rashomon, Ikiru, Seven Samurai). Basically samurai Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshirô Mifune) finds himself in the middle of a Japanese village with feuding, neither side is particularly honorable, but Sanjuro is hungry and impoverished, so he finds work as a bodyguard (or Yojimbo) for a silk merchant Tazaemon (Kamatari Fujiwara). Sanjuro chooses over a job working for sake brewer Tokuemon (Takashi Shimura), but he pretends to work for him, as part of a plan for them to tear each other apart, but he is eventually arrested for treachery. Sanjuro escapes in time to see the two warring sides fight to the finish, the plan all along was to create and restore peace, Sanjuro leaves the village for further exploits, the character returned in the sequel titled Sanjuro a year later. Also starring Eijirô Tôno as Gonji the Tavern Keeper, Seizaburô Kawazu as Seib? the Brothel Operator, Isuzu Yamada as Orin, Hiroshi Tachikawa as Yoichiro and Susumu Fujita as Homma the Instructor Who Skips Town. The performances are fine, and the direction as always is great from Kurosawa, I will admit I did not pay the fullest attention to everything going on, and it did get confusing at times, but the 19th century feel is authentic, and the sword skill and fight scenes catch your eye, I can see some reasons why it would get full marks from critics, it did influence A Fistful of Dollars and the "spaghetti western" genre, a worthwhile adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening credits are overlaid on the back of a samurai's head, and his feet, ragged sandals and all. Close-ups that give little indication of where he is going, until a dog turns up with a human hand and a father and son quarrel on giving up a boring life for high stakes gambling and fighting. He observes, even as he is momentarily pushed out of frame - he adjusts his shoulders, scratches his head, and continues on in his worn out clothes, clearly signalling that the time of the samurai is coming to an end. The violin is foreboding and in mourning. Some versions will insert ugly English captions over this sequence, but Kurosawa is not one of those directors that needs this sort of aide. Slowly and surely, we begin to understand this r&#x14d;nin, this master-less warrior, the lonely wanderer of the western. He continues this facade as he enters the town. As he first encounters Ushitora's band of mercenaries, he is surrounded and buffeted by both background and foreground, and the mass of bodies and that gigantic hammer dwarfs him. Later, as he effortlessly cuts down three of them and establishes his ability, they eye each other on equal grounding. He makes a quip towards the casket maker that rivals Harmonica's about horses. He then walks with the same walk as he opened with, but which now carries an air of dominance and dismissiveness that he rides for much of the film. And the two sides react appropriately; they slobber over him, shower him with gifts and offers in hope of his allegiance. Kurosawa makes the two sides distinct. The town is conveniently aligned much like the prototype western settlement, with a runway down the middle for those dramatic confrontations. To the side, innocents peep out from behind shutters and bars, too frightened and held hostage by the warring factions in their little village. There are some immaculately detailed shots that layer several perspectives in their deep focus; the worrying father, the conceding mother, Sanjuro musing. There is a genius segment in the inn, where Sanjuro observes the conflict from all perspectives. First he physically separates the two sides of the frame from the centre, as Inochicki goads the casket maker and he thinks on his approach. Then, he tracks and follows the band of thugs through the windows, and then finally unveils both sides and their various allegiances. Gonji, the inn owner, provides running commentary, but it is the power of Kurosawa's images and compositions that stand on their own. He cackles from high above on the bell tower, as the two sides inch towards each other and struggle to commit the opening blow. The other character who is unafraid of action and bloodshed is the snake-eyed Unosuke, in one of Tatsuya Nakadai's finest performances (perhaps second only to his gaunt King Lear in Ran). His eyes are bottomless pits of black that gleam with anticipation of violence, matching his devilish smile. He brandishes the deadliest weapon in the film, a little metal gun that signifies the coming age and the death of the sword, and unleashes it without hesitation. In the finale, Sanjuro seems to recognise this defeat even within his victory, and offers a surrender to a gun that may or may not be loaded. Opposing these pure moments of drama are the scenes that seem to make up the dark comedy aspect of Yojimbo. These meld less seamlessly than Kurosawa might have liked. There is the oafish, heavy-set Inochicki with the monobrow and not an ounce of brains who hurries from fight to fight. The constable Hansuke giggles and scurries like a scared little rat, if only to further the illusion of a town in chaos and disorder. And in one peculiar moment, a weak Sanjuro makes his escape in a casket, but then insists on being let down in order watch the Seibei house be burnt down because it "sounds interesting".But what comes after that is so magnificent. A hanging corpse in the foreground forces the eyes to the stumbling, beaten figure that stands in the midst of billowing smoke and ash (so powerful that Leone would later mirror this same exact shot, among others). One man versus a gang, slowly shuffling towards each other as the cymbals and hi-hat provide an eerie rhythmic tension that would not be out of place in a Morricone score. There is no longer the sense of swagger and otherworldly strength that Sanjuro and the samurai of the old possessed, even as he dispatches the group...but there is a message for the fleeing trembling boy, that seems to echo a sentiment from the beginning of the film. The age of heroics is over, the gun is here...and those who cannot bear to take part in the coming massacres best run home to mommy.</fullReview>

I really enjoy how the story develops and unravels with its twists and turns. The characters are also well developed as they unravel in time, revealing multiple layers of themselves and possibly changing audiences' view toward them. The directing is a great job since the movie successfully maximizes utilization on just a few sets to tell a great story like this. The bits of action sequences are also well directed, despite the lack of technology for that time. The acting is also quite nice, particularly Toshiro Mifune.

		<shortDescription>This Town Ain't Big Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've just sat down to watch a film by Akira Kurosawa. Make sure you're not squeamish by the sight of decapitated limbs and swords smashing into samurais. Kurosawa is the original master of the violent Japanese samurai flick. I wouldn't be surprised if Quentin Tarantino gets down on his knees and prays to him by his bedside at night. This genre of film that he created is based upon the period of "Jidaigeki", which has its origins in Kabuki theater. It's the music of the swords. It's the story of brave samurais fighting in honor of their families and towns. It might sound foreign to you, but it's really not. "Jidaigeki" genre movies supplied many concepts and ideas that inspired what we all know as the Spaghetti Western. Well, you should know, it was a little too inspired, but that's a story to get into another day. Kurosawa's films have an amazing shelf life to cinephiles across the globe, and none more important than "Rashoman". But I have just watched, what I feel to be the best example of Kurosawa's influence on the western genre, and what I feel to be an especially compelling and entertaining piece of work, "Yujimbo". "Yojimbo" has a story, not that complicated, and told so many times, you'd think you've sat down to watch some clichéd schlock. As I've stated before, it's about the lone hero, or in this case, the lone samurai, who somewhere along his travels comes upon a village that has been split between two rival gangs. In the town are the struggling families and business owners that are victimized day in and day out by the constant robberies and assaults from the gangs, as well the insufferable and corrupt police officer that gleefully capitulates to the two rival gangs. They ravage throughout the town, and out of sympathy for the townspeople, or perhaps just for the hell of it, the lone samurai decides to pit the two against each other in order for them to fight to death. It is out of his virtue to save the town from the hands of crime, and he's well aware of it very early on in the film, as he notices a dog carrying a severed human hand around the town. This is the Wild West, or shall we say, the wild east. In this little town, the lone samurai helps cause chaos and showdowns abound as the rival gangs fight for territory. It's almost comedic how much manipulation he has over them. I loved how it didn't always work out. For instance, the lone samurai is seen overhearing a conversation of the hotel owners planning to kill him in order to not pay for his stay. It seems like he's been causing a lot of trouble, much to the chagrin of the town's people. I really enjoyed the balance between action, story and humor. Unlike "Rashoman" that captivates with a rigid, dramatic story with a lot of unsightly, gruesome characters trying to eat each other alive, this is a fun little western. It's a classic in the genre as it gets. The lone samurai even bears a strange resemblance his American counterpart, Clint Eastwood, complete with his squinty eyes and scowl. The man in question is Toshiro Mifune, and he has a spectacular track record with Akira Kurosawa. Every time he collaborates with him, you're going to get an unbelievable performance. In "Rashoman" he was the insane, giggling bandit, and here, he's the silent, master of the sword, who could cut your arm off with a single blow. He's the original badass movie star. Even when he goes down, he goes down hard. When the lone samurai gets captured towards the end of the film, he is seen slowly and painfully making his mistake. This probably was my favorite scene, for it demonstrates Mifune's range as an actor, and his willingness to discomfort himself for the benefit of the story. The picture also has a really unique soundtrack. I overheard someone in the audience chuckling about it, for it sounded a little similar to "Big Band". The music fits the attitude of the picture splendidly. It's a big, loud soundtrack to a big story. The cinematography was also very ambitious for it's time, and Kurosawa's main cinematographer, Kazuo Miyagawa, noticeably builds upon his great talent of the image since Rashoman. The battle sequences are sweeping and detailed with all the blood and guts intact. The spectacular scene in which the lone samurai is escaping is staged and shot beautifully. Miyagawa holds an exceptional gift of bringing the Edo Japanese era vibrantly to life. "Yojimbo" is a violent epic, and one of Kurosawa's most startlingly good achievements. It's entertaining, thrilling and a credit to the history of Japanese cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This town is full of men who are better off dead," muses ronin Mifune when he saunters into town: "This place would be better off without them." (A clear indication that something's not quite right comes when he sees a dog trot past with a human hand clamped in its jaws...) He approaches one of the two factions vying for control of the town and, when they brag about how dangerous they are, he asks, "So you won't mind if I kill all of you?" "WHAT?" one of the startled bandits cries: "Kill me if you can!" "It'll hurt," Mifune advises him. He cuts down two men and literally disarms a third before walking away. Seeing a coffin maker, he says, "Two coffins." He then pauses, glances back at the mortally wounded third man (who's on his knees, screaming in agony), and offers: "Maybe THREE..." Needless to say, both sides begin bargaining for his services. It's been said that "the Italians are known for their pizza (or is it spaghetti?), which they got from the Chinese." It doesn't take a genius to figure out where Leone got the idea(s) for the FISTFUL OF DOLLARS trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In what would inspire the "man with no name" drifter, a mysterious samurai comes into town and decides to rid it of outlaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's 1961 film YOJIMBO is a Japanese period drama where wily strategy is worth just as much as prowess with a sword. In the late Edo era (some decades before its end in 1868) a community is plagued by two opposing gangs who have built up a criminal empire of prostitution and gambling. Even the local officials are on the take. Into this town steps a nameless samurai (Toshiro Mifune). Once they get a taste of his swordsmanship, both sides want to hire him, but he decides to play them off against each other and free the innocent citizens from this evil.In past films Kurosawa had taken advantage of Mifune's ability to produce exaggerated facial expressions of laughter and fear. Here, however, the nameless samurai is completely unflappable, while it is the criminal bosses and corrupt officials who play the clowns. Ikio Sawamura is a town constable constantly toadying to the gangsters, for example, while Isuzu Yamada gives a memorably sassy performance as the madame of a brothel. In what would become a convention of the Japanese period drama, the numerous henchmen in the gangs were apparently chosen from the most grotesque men that Kurosawa could find (each furthermore has distinctively ratty attire), and one thug is played by an actor suffering from gigantism.That darkly comedic drama between the characters coexists with brutal violence. Yet, while audiences may have been shocked in 1961 by the samurai dispatching his opponents with realistic slashing sound effects and a hacked off limb, there are only a handful of fights here, and they are all over in a flash. (Indeed, one of the most striking aspects of Mifune's acting is his speed in executing the sword moves.) While Kurosawa delights in gangsters getting their comeuppance, he doesn't revel in gore.Much has been said about how this Japanese film would inspire Westerns made in America and Europe (Sergio Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS was a straight-up remake). However, the film is also interesting for how it draws so much on influences from the West. Kurosawa's inspiration was an American crime caper by Dashiell Hammett, the samurai's walk down the main street is drawn from the Westerns of John Ford et al., the soundtrack mixes Japanese music with Western instruments such as harpsichord, and Tatsuya Nakadai's pretty-boy looks are clearly modeled on Hollywood.All in all, I was very impressed by this film. Everything here ? from the script and aspect to little things like the wind and dust and the little decorations on the set ? seems the result of great effort and talent, all coming together to impress the viewer. And like Kurosawa's RASHOMON, it stays fresh even as its elements have been repeatedly reused by other film and television productions for half a century now.Note that Kurosawa would go on to use Mifune's character again the next year in the film SANJURO, and the two films are often considered together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic I just didn't engage in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-5/10Yojimbo, A samurai action movie created by the legendary director and writer Akira Kurosawa. This movie is considered the stuff of movie legend, but for me, it is far from it. It's not that it's a bad movie, not even that poor, I just didn't feel it is special and wound up for me an average movie. So why do people love this so much?, well to be perfectly honest I have no idea, it is smart no doubt but just too dull to be fully enjoyed, the kind of movie only some can fully appreciate.Now don't get me wrong, the movie is pretty much built up of well done things, but just not well enough. Toshiro Mifune is very good as the samurai who makes up his name, he seems to act at a much higher level than everyone else in this cast, top stuff. As the acting goes though, it is not good and even though Mifune is on form, the rest of the cast drag the acting score so low I can't give it credit. The problem is it is just so over the top, it isn't believable and the characters seem like from a comedy at times. Kurosawa directs and co writes well enough for this, it isn't maybe what I expect from a movie held in such high regard, but nevertheless you can see his skill at times. The movie I felt is not paced all that well, it has a very slow beginning and very little action actually, the ending is the opposite with lots going on and more action than before, it needed for me to be more evenly spread. I think yet again the case with the cinematography and the editing is the same as the others before, done well not just not very well. I felt the editing could be a little sloppy, the cinematography makes sure that the technical side does it well with a nice approach and some pretty nice shots too. One thing I really disliked in the movie, maybe the most is the score, now some people who have seen it may read this part and disagree which is fine, but for me it is horrible, doesn't fit in the picture and makes ordinary scenes going slowly seem like there meant to be massive epic shots.I think sometimes it is easy to criticise an older movie because it doesn't have the same things we have today, but this movie does have some positives. The ending is at moments thrilling and as mentioned the action stepped up, the fighting is a little poorly choreographed but I feel it only looks that way because of the editing to make it look less violent. That said this movie is not all that gory and horrible, the odd death and arm cut off, but not in a disgusting way, the movie is more sensible than to horrify the viewer.I think by the end, you either could watch this with great praise or great displeasure, but even if you pick one way or the other, most should admit this is a smart plot. Of course Sergio Leone's "Man With no Name" series must be inspired by this, and that being a spaghetti western just goes to show how far this movie can reach and also inspire around the world. I do feel this is a kind of plot that works better like say in a western, a good story but points in it just not good enough for me, Kurosawa doesn't waste his time, he just doesn't make it enjoyable enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Yôjinbô" (1961) is a very entertaining movie even if you are watching it first time in 2015. Acting was very good, especially by Toshirô Mifune whom i didn't like much in previous Akira Kurosawa's movies - he was always overacting, playing it over the top. Here he is very good. Story itself is intriguing and very well paced, at running time 1 h 50 min this movie barely drags and is entertaining from start till finish. I read that "Yôjinbô" inspired many westerns and one was inspired by them and that is true - the plot is very similar here to many westerns, especially with Clint Eastwood famous "Dollars" trilogy. Overall, "Yôjinbô" can be safely called a classic, it's truly is, because even seeing this film first time in 2015 one can admire its craftsmanship. Story is intriguing, acting is good, and nevertheless you have seen this story by now many times, you should definitely check out "Yôjinbô" - it's great entertainment.</fullReview>

Almost from the very beginning, right down to the performances, direction, and script, this has the feel of a classic Leone western as the guy clearly helped himself to bits and pieces. And he must have figured that he'd largely get away with it because so few western people at the time would have ever actually had the chance to even know about this far-east hit. For anyone interested in classic Asian films, or just classic films in general, this is a must- watch that's well worth tracking down. There's a fair share of action, fun, and sheer entertainment value to be had from this quality, and still watchable first rate winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one word I can use to describe this movie, it is Badass. This is another Kurasawa/Mifune collaboration, Mifune has acted in Kurasawa movies like Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and Rashomon.The movie's star is Sanjuro (Mifune), he is a sword for hire. His loyalty lies where the money lies. He is willing to kill to show his worth. Mifune does o wonderful job portraying this character. He is calm, funny and of course Badass.I love the black &amp; white cinematography. There is something really appealing about black &amp; white movies. The contrasts between night and day, foreground and background, action and reaction are quite clear. You can often see it in a single shot.This movie inspired the unofficial remake: Fistful of Dollars. I love Fistful and Yojimbo, but i think that Yojimbo is better. There are definitely things that Fistful does better, most notably the music. However I believe that Yojimbo will resonate with me longer.Awesome movie, see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanna Hire Toshiro Mifune?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Yojimbo" (Bodyguard), is a wonderful drama. There isn't enough fight scenes that I would qualify it as an action movie, but it certainly doesn't fall short in style, substance and even comedy. Debatable comments have been made whether it drew influence from the classic 1929 detective novel "Red Harvest", the film shines as one of the best of the Kurosawa-Mifune collaborations, and was remade in America as the iconic "A Fistful Of Dollars" (1964).A wandering Ronin (Toshiro Mifune) comes across a town that is virtually empty at first glance. However, it doesn't take too long for him to find out that the town has two crime lords trying to dominate each other for supremacy. Realizing the possible potentials of profit, he decides to offer his services to each mob and easily flips every situation to his gain. How long can he keep this charade up?I find that our nameless protagonist "Kuwabatake Sanjuro" ("Mulberry-field Thirty-youth"), is one of Toshiro Mifune's most endearing performances. It easily captures the somewhat playful attitude that makes him such a lovable rogue, but he can also dive into an intense portrayal and scenario effortlessly. This is also the first Kurosawa movie for another eventual regular Tatsuya Nakadai, who had an extremely fleeting appearance in "Seven Samurai" (1954). He is a wonderful rival to Mifune, and he does extremely well with his character given the lack of dialogue.Finally what remains to be mentioned is the insanely wonderful musical opening score, and Kurosawa's camera-work looks as effortless as always. Clearly the image of a Samurai standoff in town hails back to any classical Western, and remains some of the most vivid imagery in all of his black and white movies. Just to note as well that Kurosawa's use of wind bellowing in some scenes really makes great and subtle emphasis.Final Verdict: I don't think I need to sell this movie to you anymore, watch it once and fall in love with it forever. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Yojimbo" is an action movie which is combined really well with drama. In this movie we have a town which is divided in two parts by two criminal gangs, and a samurai who comes in this town in order to free the citizen of it. So he decides to play them against each other to succeed his goal and free them all.I liked this movie because for one more time the plot and the direction from Akira Kurosawa was outstanding and I believe that this movie is one of his masterpieces. Also the cast was selected with the best criteria and this is obvious in the whole duration of the film because of their interpretation. Especially the interpretation of Toshirô Mifune who played as Sanjuro Kuwabatake the Samurai was simply outstanding for one more time. Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned is Tatsuya Nakadai's who played as Unosuke - Gunfighter.Finally I believe that "Yojimbo" is one of the best samurai movies in which Akira Kurosawa did his best as he does in all of his movies. In addition to this I have to say that "Yojimbo" reminded another movie which was also made by Akira Kurosawa the "Seven Samurai" which I also found very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's class act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last of Kurosawa's samurai films I had on my list to watch, as I actually saw the sequel to this (SANJURO) beforehand. Not that it matters, as the two films feature the same character but have totally unconnected stories. I actually liked SANJURO the better of the two, mainly because it was funnier and more tightly scripted. However, there's no denying that YOJIMBO is a great movie in itself, a film both highly influenced by westerns and which would highly influence westerns to come (Sergio Leone famously 'borrowed' the story for his iconic classic A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS).The story is taken from the pages of pulp fiction and involves a rogue samurai (Toshiro Mifune, on top form) who comes into a rural town and finds a war going on between opposing gangs. Determined to clean up the mess, he plays both sides against one another, with the stakes gradually raising as the action ensues. Along the way there are some great set-pieces as you'd expect from Kurosawa; I particularly liked Sanjuro's attack on the building where the wife is being held hostage.Kurosawa is, as ever, a master of form and the widescreen cinematography looks fantastic. He also elicits great performances from a strong cast, with actors bringing to life the nuances of the scripting. Tatsuya Nakadai really stands out as the slick bad guy but the actors playing the other bizarre and memorable, almost comic-book characters are fine too. All in all, YOJIMBO is an acknowledged classic and for good reason - it's great fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yojimbo is one of the five most famous Kurosawa films. I don't know if it's because it was remade without Kurosawa's permission as a western called A Fistful of Dollars by Sergio Leone (and later as Last Man Standing with Bruce Willis, amongst other films that borrow the same storyline) or because it was successful in its initial release and was talked about ever since it came out.It's also one of the most unique Kurosawa's films, because in this one he does not seem to try to send out a strong political, ideological or environmental message like he usually does. It's a very simple and entertaining story.The main character, played by Mifune, is of course one of the coolest heroes in film history, however this wouldn't be so without some neat direction ideas, such as having Mifune act like a scruffy dog by twitching his shoulders. He is the archetypal smooth mystery man who allows himself not to follow any strict paths in life. He tosses a stick in the air and decides where he's going to go next by seeing where the stick points to when it falls. He doesn't have a permanent name, but instead combines the word sanjuro (30-something- year old) with whatever other word he feels like, meaning he's Kuwabatake Sanjuro (30-Year Old Mulberry Field) in this film, and Tsubaki Sanjuro (30-Year Old Camelia) in the sequel, which was simply named Sanjuro.The music by Masaru Sato is very refreshing because it isn't played by traditional instruments, as it always seems to be in these samurai films. Another interesting attribute of the film is the first major role of Tatsuya Nakadai in a Kurosawa film, a role of a gun nut who is easily the most memorable baddie in this flick.</fullReview>

Sensing an opportunity to make some money as well as to free the town from daily oppression, he decides to play one side off against the other while the two rival bosses try to hire him as their bodyguard but his plan is soon complicated by the arrival of one of the gangsters' son, who wields a revolver.Directed by the legendary filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa, Yojimbo still hasn't aged a day &amp; remains one of the most influential treasures of world cinema. Kurosawa's direction is absolutely top-notch, cinematography captures the plot events in sharp focus, editing paces the story excellently but it's Toshirô Mifune's bravura performance that makes this film such an emotionally-charged ride. There are also moments of well-timed humour plus the music makes its presence felt at the right moments too.On an overall scale, Yojimbo is a wonderfully crafted period drama that further elevates the craftsmanship of a master storyteller &amp; benefits greatly from a strong, disciplined &amp; impressive lead performance. It being still able to amaze &amp; entertain even after having been imitated so many times is a testament to its greatness &amp; ageless appeal and for the fine balance it presents over its drama, action &amp; entertainment, Yojimbo is a must for cinema lovers around the world.</fullReview>

The next in command objects and forms his own gang. Sanjuro makes money by pitting the two sides against each other. Then Unosuke returns to town with a revolver. Sanjuro rescues beautiful Nui for her pathetic husband and son.Many have drawn inspiration from this Akira Kurosawa movie. More importantly, they have drawn inspiration from this character. He is the iconic anti-hero and an inspiration for the man with no name. The movie starts with a son who runs away to be a hired thug. He rather live it up and die young than to live a long bland farmer's life. Then when Sanjuro first gets to town, he sees a dog walk off with a severed hand setting the tone for the movie. So much of this movie is memorable. When the gangs face off, they hilariously can't quite get the fight started. This character isn't the classic white hat good guy. He's in it for the money. Even the victims are pathetic to him, but he still has enough morality to rescue the innocent.</fullReview>

When I watched Seven Samurai, I was very much taken aback by Kurosawa's talent as a director and as a writer. From then on, I always wanted to watch more of his creations. Yojimbo is a samurai based film. A samurai comes to an unpleasant, miserable village, where there is a war going on between two groups of gamblers. Both of them want him as their bodyguard. But something very different is going on in his mind. What is it? Well, you'll have to see the film. The performances are top notch. The direction is superb.

		<fullReview>Before "Yojimbo," Kurosawa's movies were usually character-driven morality tales ("Throne of Blood" and "Rashomon") or ruminations on class and historical change ("Stray Dog" and "Seven Samurai"). "Yojimbo" therefore represents a retreat from substance in favor of relatively meaningless, stylized violence. This shift in what movies aimed to do as the 1950s gave way to the 1960s was mirrored in Hollywood and Italy, where Kurosawa movies exerted a strong influence on a new generation of filmmakers. "Yojimbo" is undoubtedly well-made, but Toshiro Mifune's talents as a bombastic character actor are to some extent wasted when he is cast as the stable center of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yojimbo's one of those movies where if it were a person, you'd say they have a "great personality." That's not to say it looks bad, it's got those classic windswept showdowns, pitch perfect casting and cinematography, but it's what you don't see that makes it work: the whole thing is basically a play on the dynamic of what we know vs. what the characters know. Hitchcock himself probably couldn't have wrung more suspense out of scenes like Mifune staging the aftermath of a siege to explain the corpses he created, or his encounter with the pistol guy midway through the movie. The only flaw is perhaps that the storytelling is occasionally a bit wonky, throwing contrivances and blind coincidences at you to advance the narrative, and then working them into the big picture of things when it finds the time. The plot's certainly above passable, but it's really all about the sleuthing, the espionage, and the lone face of humanity in a heap of grotesque sycophants and mud-crawling poverty, Toshiro Mifune. Recommended if you breathe oxygen; as with most of Kurosawa's stuff, it blurs the line between art and entertainment, turning a story full of death, rape and sadomasochism into something charmingly, subversively broad.The trailer is an interesting little piece of art in its own right, and features great unused footage.</fullReview>

A no-name masterless samurai wonders 15th Century Japan (I don't know Japanese history so don't bash me if I got the century wrong) and comes across a town run by 2 crime gangs, he attempts to bring down both of them so that the townsfolk can live in peace.Toshiro Mifune is a really good actor. I have only seen 2 Kurosawa films (for a fact I feel Kurosawa and Bergman are the only 2 directors that actually live up to their reputation) and seeing him as Kuchyio in one role then The Samurai in this made me think "Wow".I will definitely watch the sequel and the Americaan counterpart (but I won't watch A Fistful Of Dollars until I watch The Magnificent Seven - from what I have been told as much more worthwhile) just expect the Kurosawa style of Seven Samurai, only for 100 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yojimbo has maintained its well-earned spot in the top 250 with crisp acting, cutting dialogue and an excellent homage to the period involved.It doesn't take long for our hero Sanjuro the fallen Samurai to stumble into a nameless village, size up the competition and turn their jealousies against each other, ultimately bringing ruin (and freedom) to the city. Ultimately, Sanjuro bids himself off to each clan and learns their motivations then turns on them to display their greed and shallow view. It all catches up to him as he is captured by one of the clans and pummeled to an inch of his life by a Richard Kiel clone.Still, if Yojimbo teaches us anything it is that your wits can do far more than any katana or other implements of destruction. After eliminating the gangs Sanjuro walks into the sunset, not unlike your heroic cowboy that finally restored order after some well-fought battles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another famous movie made by the Kurosawa - Mifune duo. Kurosawa started deviating from realistic depiction of samurai to more stylized story that's comical at times since he made this movie. The ronin in this movie is also named Sanjuro, but there is no indication that the two are one and the same person.A ronin (Toshiro Mifune) shows up in town where only thriving business seems to be the coffin maker. There are two rival gangs vying for power, and the ronin plays on both of them so they wipe each other out.The acting and setting of the story is very artificial. There is no way people of that period behaved in the manner shown in this movie. But that's Kurosawa's style. You can also see this in his later works such as "Ran".There are many funny moments in this movie, and this was the attraction for people going to movies when this movie first came out. It was the golden age of Samurai movies in Japan at the time this movie was made, and many samurai movies from that era were highly stylized and shot gorgeously. Most of them have never been shown outside of Japan (such as ones starring Hashizo Ookawa - another super star from that era). This movie is part of that culture. Only few years after this movie was made that era would come to an abrupt end with people shifting their entertainment to TV, and many movie studios that thrived on making samurai movies will go out of business. Kurosawa himself will find it difficult to make movies.The story borders on preposterous, but Mifune plays the good - bad guy so well that we just can't help enjoying the situation.It's not a movie for everyone, but an interesting movie to watch if you like Kurosawa, or like samurai period pieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This seems like a classic plot for a western, but instead of a cowboy a poor masterless samurai comes into a town torn between two gangs and tries to cash in on them as he is the key to victory with his unsurpassed sword-technique. A game starts.Toshiro Mifune is able to carry this movie on his own, his presence on screen, like his sword-mastery is second to none. Luckily this movie also has the visual mind of Akira Kurosawa and a fitting set. This town is on the verge of becoming a ghost town, by senseless killing and rivalry.Under Kurosawa's supervision this movie has no dull moment whatsoever, and once the action picks up you're locked in for the rest of it. It's also well cast, I just wish the giant would fight with his club. The old man in the restaurant next to the coffin maker is my favorite character next to Yojimbo. And some poor guys arm get cut off so the blood spurts out like from a fire-hose, Kurosawa invented that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bloodbath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reviewing the Kurosawa canon. This is really an interesting film because of the character of the townspeople. They have none. When Sanjuro comes to the town looking for work, he quickly realizes that he has walked into hell. Being wise and perceptive, he quickly uses the greed and avarice to his advantage. By pitting the two town factions against each other, he not only gives himself purpose, he cleans up a cesspool. This is scene after scene of bitter commentary by the town leaders. They take great joy in persecuting one another, yet they are cowardly, hoping that Sanjuro will take their side. Death is everywhere. One of the most interesting scenes is when the coffin maker leaves because there aren't enough left in the town to pay for his coffins.Mifune became a star in this film. His cold presence and, yes, even his vulnerability (he is seriously injured) make him an interesting hero. One can sense the disgust his character feels toward this awful town. Kurowawa seemed to take a slightly lighter touch later on, making things a bit more comedic. There is nothing comedic in this film. It's a desolate piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most difficult comments are ones on the best films. It is very hard to explain and justify the value of such piece of art as Yojimbo. If we can categorize this film as action movie, than it is most probably the best action movie ever made, mass copied by the greatest action directors in Hollywood but everywhere else as well. I have to emphasize that best of them are not even close to Yojimbo. Not even close considering anything, so I will just sadly disregard dumb comments posted as Kurosawa Vs Sergio Leone. Is there anyone of you that can say: "Mozart Vs Moricone"? Is that comparable? Well, I let that judgment to your gray cells responsible for art value and taste. Toshiro Mifune had represented the whole new movie culture until that time, the film idea of one man against the whole world. Yojimbo is someone who serves that idea originally and never seen until then - in traditional Japanese way. His later decent, Bruce Lee is putting that idea practically in the modern form: English language, western manners and western money. This is why I like to call Toshiro Mifune the spiritual father of modern action film, while Bruce Lee is a hero who was a practical establisher. Kurosawa is without doubt the greatest master of action movies of all times. His sense for dramatic directing, smart camera, short and dynamic dialogs and far best usage of music in action films makes him the grandmaster of its kind. He is manipulating with deepest human emotions of the spectator and by that Yojimbo is far from just action movie which makes it number one. What is the miraculous about this film is that it maintains your attention every single second on the highest level, involving you every single second deeper and deeper. There are no such movies any more. Considering the values of the votes on this site, I give Yojimbo 100 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yay Yojimbo!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think a lot of movie fans would name The Seven Samurai or The Hidden Fortress as their #1 Kurosawa film, but Yojimbo is my favourite. You may find this hard to believe but this movie influenced Sergio Leone's A Fistfull of Dollars. The Man with no Name who has becomes the world's most famous cardboard character was based on Yojimbo's lead role.Once again, Toshiro Mifune stars. Set in the late 1800's, he plays a wandering Ronin (a samurai for hire, rather than in the service of a monarch) who stumbles upon a seemingly peaceful village after a long day of walking a dusty road. He soon discovers that the village is a battleground for two rival mobs. Both are eager to have our hero on their side, once they learn that he is a skilled warrior. He gets cleaver and turns this feud into a game, playing both side against each other with repetitious double crossing.Of course, there is a reason why Yojimbo is my favourite Kurosawa. It feels lighter and chirpier than the others. He adds a slight dose of dry humor to the premise, which keeps it from being too dark. He may be a slow story teller, but Kurosawa is no dud, he is a master craftsman. If you have patience and true cinematic appreciation, you will not question films like Yojimbo for a moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Am Eating A Twister</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Yo, Jimbo! Get back here with my arm!' Yes, this is the famous story set in the Chinese version of Hick America. Based on some Shakespeare book it is also black and white and in a strange language. I want to go to the movies and see stuff blow up, and watch people get shot in FULL COLOURS. I mean, how realistic can black and white be. I understand that people were poor in the olden days, well then they should have just waited until they invented colour before making films because these are just too unbelievable. I find it difficult to relate to people when they are speaking funny words I don't be understanding, and especially when they're a different colour. I don't mean that in a racistphobe way, I just can't take anything seriously when it comes from a grey mouth. But, alas I was forced to watch this my girlfriend as she said it was Clint Eastwood's favourite film so it might be okay.The film is set in some sort of shanty town where dogs eat each other's arms and everyone lives in boxes. There are two different Kings and they hate each other. The each own half the village, but each want to take over completely. For the people caught in between, all they see is fighting and death and just want to be at peace. We see brothers fighting each others, families and neighbours, and friendships torn apart by this separation. This is of course a major them of every Shakespeare book- dualisticism. Where there is a man, there is a similar but different woman etc. Of course we know from school that Shakespeare lived through the British Civil War and saw his own family split up (Romeo and Julius is based on his childhood romance with the girl next door and most of his other books are affected by this). Pretty boring so far. Into this mix comes a mysterious stranger with no name called Jimbo. He sees this as a good chance to make some monies and get some free sake and a bit of a kip, so he pretends to joining both sides and make them fight more. Eventually he gets bored and kills everyone except the coffin maker who becomes a millionaire. He walks off into the night leaving the ghosts to mourn their foolish mistakes and realise they should have looked after each other and worried about this immigrant instead. This leaves us with many questions- was he really God? Was he really a devil? Was he just a mental? Why did that woman keep smiling? For all the people that were killed it's all a bit rubbish and we don't see any blood and the whole thing lacks excitements. Perhaps if someone was to remake this film with colour and lots of action and fights it would be good. All the issues like morals and foreigners wrecking the place, and war and jealousy are all the more important nowadays. This may be Clint's favourite movie, but just imagine if he had been in a remake of it, with guns instead of swords. That would have been great.Best Scene: When Jimbo is hiding from all the townspeople and he crawls underneath the boardwalk and the people's house so they don't see him. He hides under one bedroom and sees a young women stripping and getting washed. He watches every slip of clothing fall off slowly, sees the nubile young thing step into the steaming tub and all the moisture drip over her aching body. We then see her step out, pad herself softly with a silky cloth and get into bed, naked and sleep. This was the beginning of a new genre of Asian movies- good ones!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like the masterpiece "The Seven Samurai" this is a really powerful movie about a samurai. Like the other movies in this series of Samurai movies it is actually pre-Bruce Lee martial arts movies. As action movies they are excellent and still very relevant today. Mifune is, of course, excellent as the main character which inspired Eastwood's roles in the famous Westerns. As I wrote in my Seven Samurai review, this is really an impressive display of macho power, and Kurosawa's movies also has keen philosophical and psychological insight in the human nature similar to, say, the novels of Dostojevskij. This is a must-see for movie fans. Truly an excellent movie gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite Kurosawa movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been meaning to watch Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo for quite a while now. Ever since i heard that this was the film that inspired Sergio Leone to make A Fistful of Dollars i had to see what was the catalyst for not only a great series of Westerns but the careers of Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone.A dishevelled wandering samurai reaches a crossroads. Picking up a stick, he tosses it in the air. He then follows the direction the stick points. Thus we are introduced to the hero of this film, and at the same time shown that he is a ronin, a masterless samurai with no ties. Arriving in a nearby village, he discovers the place to be desolate and windswept, with no obvious signs of life. But in fact there are two rival gangs, led by Seibei and his former lieutenant Ushi-Tora, trying to monopolise the local trades. Seibei has the silk and sex trades parcelled up, while Ushi-Tora controls the sake. After demonstrating his strength as a samurai, both sides want to hire him as a yojimbo (bodyguard) so that they can finish off the other gang and have everything to themselves. The samurai, whom we learn is Sanjuro Kuwabataké (though that is undoubtedly not his real name), has other plans for the village. He proceeds to play one side off against the other in an attempt to destroy both. Nobody made films like Akira Kurosawa. Only having recently been introduced to his movies i must say they have had a big affect on me. Because they have influenced so many great film makers it has led me on to see some classic movies otherwise which i may have never had seen. I watched and reviewed The Seven Samurai and Ikiru recently but without doubt Yojimbo is my favourite. This film is dark yet humorous and you cant help but love the characters on show. The narrative is easy to follow and the acting is superb and as usual in all Akira Kurosawa's films , the protagonists on show are just that little bit mad! . But the best thing about Yojimbo is it's simplicity. Toshirô Mifune is fantastic as the scheming samurai and i also loved the performance of Daisuke Katô who played the cowardly brother of Ushitora. To be fair this does not resemble a Fistful of Dollars very much at all yet you can see how American westerns influenced the way Kurosawa made his movies . Yojimbo is fun to watch on every level and if you love movies and have not seen this before , you must! 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterless samurai wanders into an anonymous town and finds that two different rival gangs are warring against each other for the rights to own it. This samurai, known only as Sanjuro, decides to play along both sides in hopes of destroying them both.This story is probably most well-known to those fans of the Clint Eastwood trilogy Man With No Name as this was the story in the first film, A Fistful of Dollars. As it turns out, the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa made it first just three years prior. Here, the fabulous actor Toshiro Mifune portrays a restless, yet brilliant samurai who tries to help free a town by working with both sides against each other, thus defeating them both. It is an intriguing plot, and works for both Kurosawa and Fistful director Sergio Leone. Here, there is also a feel of a western set in a Japanese samurai era. There are some great face-offs between the two parties and the action scenes are splendid. If you are a Kurosawa fan, this is a must-see. If you like A Fistful of Dollars, it is also worth checking out to see where the story originated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another fine piece of storytelling from Kurosawa...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time Kurosawa decided to embark upon YOJIMBO (in 1960/1), he had already established himself as a legendary filmmaker in the West and decided to pay homage to one of the West's more notoriously famous film genres: The Western. While this film is actually regarded as homage to the Western, the careful observer will see that the film also sporadically pokes fun at the genre; another example of Kurosawa'a brilliance.The film itself is wonderfully done; it represents Kurosawa in his element: storytelling, and there is no shortage of plot twists here for the avid viewer to enjoy. The direction and screenplay are excellent, as is the acting, as Toshiro Mifune (think of him as such: De Niro is to Scorsese as Mifune is to Kurosawa) produces perhaps his finest role on film, perhaps because he is the central character and not part of an ensemble. Mifune's character is the personification of cool; the anti-heroic mercenary who never seems to be fazed. His portrayal in this Motion Picture even ranks among (and some may argue higher) Clint Eastwood's best. Tatsuya Nakadai is also impressive as Mifune's most significant 'villain'.The music itself is also amazing, perhaps the best in any Kurosawa film, especially the mood-setting opening piece. Notably though, Ennio Morricone's score for the remake PER UN PUGNO DI DOLLARI was a bit better. The final verdict here is that there is plenty to enjoy and appreciate in this masterpiece by the master storyteller.It is also worth noting that this film, while an homage to Westerns, was the inspiration behind Sergio Leone's PER UN PUGNO DI DOLLARI, which helped sparked the spaghetti Western revolution. As such, it is difficult to imagine what the Western would be like today were it not for YOJIMBO. On a side note, this film also served as a reference for LAST MAN STANDING, but the less said about that film, the better...So here comes the inevitable question: Where does YOJIMBO stand in Kurosawa's collection? While not as grand or epic in scope as SHICHININ NO SAMURAI, or as intellectually stimulating or thought-provoking as RASHOMON, it is easy to see why many viewers will regard YOJIMBO as Kurosawa's best, due to its wider appeal (for instance, it is not nearly as long as SHICHININ NO SAMURAI, not as puzzling as RASHOMON, plus it has a strong comedic element to it). I personally rank it as Kurosawa'a third best, behind the aforementioned.3.5 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Should enter my Top 150 at about 138 or so. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yojimbo Stands Alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yojimbo translates into English as Bodyguard, such as the protagonist in the film, Sanjuro Kuwabatake, the samurai. He finds his way to a town that is torn apart by two gangs who both believe they are entitled to run the town. The boss of each of the clans attempts to employ the samurai as a bodyguard and as the missing piece to take over the town. However, Kuwabatake has plans of his own. When Kuwabatake arrives to the town he proclaims, "I get paid for killing and this town is full of men who are better off dead." The line sent shivers down my spine, and set the tone for the rest of the movie. Akira Kurosawa shows why he is regarded as one of the best writers and directors to ever step on a movie set. The story unfolds beautifully in the rundown Japanese town in which it is set. Every element of the story worked together flawlessly to create another masterpiece by Kurosawa. Kurosawa's other movies include classics such as Rashomon, Ran, The Hidden Fortress, Throne of Blood, one of my all-time favorites The Seven Samurai.Yojimbo also influenced filmmakers from Sergio Leone to George Lucas. Leone remade Yojibo as A Fistful of Dollars, the first movie that featured Clint Eastwood as "The Man with No Name," which later provided the sequels, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, another of my all-time favorites. George Lucas, creator of the Star Wars, my All-Time favorite, and Indiana Jones movie franchises also pays homage to Kurosawa in his films. Most notably is the identical scene of Kuwabatake cutting off a man's arm, and Obi-Wan Kenobi mimicking his actions in Star Wars. Yojimbo has everything needed to be a great movie, a superior story, a legendary director, good action, and some comedy. The film may be over 40 years old, but it still stands tall as a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fistful of Dollars at High Noon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first "man with no name" was Toshirô Mifune, who made 16 films with writer/director Akira Kurosawa, starting with Drunken Angel in 1948, and ending with Red beard in 1965. This is one of his greatest performances.Anyone familiar with American or Italian spaghetti westerns will instantly see the story here. The loner walks into town and sees an opportunity to play both sets of bad guys against each other to make money from each. It is funny, and has lots of action as any western does.Forget any idea of foreign films when watching Mifune and Kurosawa. They are as familiar to you as films you grew up with. For great entertainment, they cannot be beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Example of a Samurai Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yojimbo manages to do something that far too many films fail to take into consideration - it keeps things simple. The characters all have fun and larger-than-life personalities, the plot is straightforward, and it's even got the right amount of seriousness to it to maintain a sense of realism. The acting was all good and believable, and the protagonist's eccentric personality often kept me guessing what he had planned next.There isn't a lot I have to complain about with Yojimbo. I could probably criticize the movie's usage of stereotypical Japanese personalities, but this is a samurai movie after all, so if anything it helps to form the basis for traditional Japanese culture and ideals. Probably my biggest complaint would be, that there isn't much action in the movie - and that's really the only thing stopping me from giving the movie a '10'. Of course, you have to take into consideration that this isn't a movie about groups of samurai warriors fighting each other, it's a movie about a witty wondering samurai who meets someone nearly as cunning and witty as he.For anyone that's a fan of samurai films, Japanese culture, proverbs and fables...or even classic American films set in the wild west - then this movie will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Kurosawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to tell just how many other films were inspired by this classic story of a lone warrior that happens to wander into a town plagued by troubles. Story takes place in Japan in the 1860's and a lone samurai warrior is wandering about with no place to go. Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune) comes to a fork in the road and decides which way to go by the way a stick is pointed. He ends up in a town where a dog has a human hand in his mouth and this perks Sanjuro's interest and he decides to hang around. He goes to a local tavern and meets the owner Gonji (Eijiro Tono) who feeds him sake and rice and he tells him of the troubles that the town has. He explains that Ushitora (Kyu Sazanka) and Seibei (Seizaburo Kawazu) once were business partners but had a terrible falling out and now both head gangs and want to take over the town. Sanjuro is amused by this and he heads into the street where he encounters some thugs from Ushitora's side and he kills most of them. The word spreads quickly that a strong samurai is in the area and both want to pay him to be their bodyguard. Sanjuro uses his wits to get paid by both of them and set up events where members of each gang get killed and blame each other.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Ushitora has a brother Unosuke (Tatsuya Nakadai) that owns a gun and he figures out that Sanjuro has been playing everyone for fools so he manages to get his sword away from him and they take him back to their lair where Sanjuro is badly beaten. He manages to escape and with the help of Gonji he hides out near a cemetery until he gets strong enough to seek revenge.Yojimbo is a classic all by itself and it has inspired many other films most notably "A Fistful of Dollars" with Clint Eastwood. So many things make this a unique film and how can you forget the shot of the dog with the hand in his mouth? Sanjuro was looking for a place where maybe he could find trouble brewing and one look at what that dog was carrying was a clear signal that he was in the right spot. The cinematographer is Kazuo Miyagawa who has worked with Akira Kurosawa many times and this is a terrific film to look at. There are many scenes where characters are standing in the street and the wind is blowing dirt and sand and these shots add so much life to the screen even when the characters are silent. Mifune once again is magnificent and one of the great things about his character are the human flaws that ultimately almost get him killed. At first Sanjuro is brash and confident but after helping a couple and their child he leaves himself vulnerable. Sanjuro is horribly beaten and Mifune shows every ounce of pain that his character is experiencing and its in stark contrast from earlier in the film where Sanjuro's movements seemed lackadaisical from confidence. Mifune had an incredible screen presence and watching him in certain scenes late in the film I was reminded of Robert DeNiro in "Raging Bull" where these characters were alone and had to ponder how they ever got into their situation. This part of the story gives the film a zone of realism that the audience can identify with and this makes Sanjuro more human. Kurosawa always had great set designs and the town that this story is suppose to take place in resembles something from a western and its probably not a coincidence since Kurosawa loved American films. This is easily a must see for everyone and I believe its one of Mifune's greatest performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At The Gate Of Hell ... I'll Wait For You There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In nineteenth century Japan, a wandering ronin comes across a village ravaged by two rival gangs. Attracted by the violent and lawless circumstances, the samurai hires himself out as bodyguard to both sides, curious as to what will develop ...This is one of Kurosawa's best and most accessible films, a great mix of adventure yarn, action mythology, gangster intrigue and cynical comedy. I just love this story; the idea of the tough guy deliberately playing piggy-in-the-middle in an explosive situation - it's the basis for lots of movies I like (The Glass Key, Miller's Crossing, etc) - mostly because it pits an intelligent, amoral protagonist against none-too-bright hoodlums, a device which has endless dramatic/comic potential. Yojimbo is cleverer and deadlier than anybody, but sometimes his smarts get him in over his head, or reveal the altruistic side to his nature which he seeks to conceal. He's a terrific antihero, prefiguring much of the work of stars like Clint Eastwood or Arnold Schwarzenegger, and his mysterious origins and motives are endlessly fascinating to ponder. Mifune is outstanding in the lead, all sly glances and knowing grins, his body language often saying more than the (minimal) dialogue, whilst Nakadai is electrifying as the gunfighter Unosuke, constantly suspicious and on alert, his cat-like eyes ever-searching for tricks or traps. Equally fabulous is Kurosawa's cinematic treatment, a widescreen eastern/western, full of blowing dust, elegant composition, great off-guard moments (the dog at the start, the arm-slicing scene George Lucas recreated in Star Wars, the fencing teacher's cheery wave goodbye, the goon who unwittingly helps Yojimbo escape in the coffin, many others), a great cacophonous score by Masaru Sato which is somehow grim and funny at the same time, and pitch perfect editing throughout. If possible, try to see the high quality British Film Institute DVD release in the original aspect ratio. I'm never entirely sure just why I like this movie so much; it's clearly very well made and highly influential, but it's the plot which keeps drawing me back. In the end, all films need a good story and this one is a cracker. Brilliantly written by Kurosawa and Ryuzo Kikushima, and stunningly well directed. Followed by a loose and enjoyable sequel, Sanjuro, in 1962, and remade (with equally impressive results) by Sergio Leone in 1964 as Per Un Pugno Di Dollari / A Fistful Of Dollars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, funny and engaging across the board - everything about it just works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By chance a wandering samurai enters a small village where gambling and gangs have replaced the tenants of normal village life. Gang-lords Ushi-Tora and Seibei occupy either end of the community, each with a small army of hired fighters. The bitter standoff that exists as a result has turned the village into a desolate place - well, except for the undertaker, for whom business is very good indeed. After a short time observing these things, the samurai decides on the best way to use his skills at killing to remove the two gangs and return the village to normality.It is really too easy to get home in the evenings and play a film that requires no attention and very little work and, as a result, there are several subtitled films that I have recorded and/or bought that sit unwatched long after purchase. However recently I have been using my LoveFilm to make more of an effort to watch films that really I should be more familiar with and at the moment that is meaning catching up on some key films from Akira Kurosawa. I make this sound like work but actually it is good for me to focus wholly on any film but also the quality thus far has been high.Yojimbo, like Seven Samurai, will be familiar to many viewers without even watching it simply because of the amount of references and remakes it has since influenced. The remakes range from the good to the terrible (and those that think that Last Man Standing is the worst remake ever should watch Van Damme's Coyote Moon or (even worse) Albert Pyun's Omega Doom), but without a doubt Yojimbo itself manages to stand at the head of the crowded pack. There is still a misconception though that somehow because it is "foreign" and "black and white" that it will be a heavier film without the action or entertainment value of remakes such as Fistful of Dollars, but, as stated, this is a misconception. On the contrary, Yojimbo feels slick and fresh 40+ years later and provides the viewer with much to enjoy and few weaknesses as it goes.Clearly influenced himself by American westerns, Kurosawa delivers a film that is cool, funny and dramatic - with all parts working well together and none dominating the others. He shoots it with such a good eye (with cinematographer Miyagawa) and very little visual clutter (either things or style) that the viewer cannot help feel impressed by how striking the samurai looks in the middle of the film but he never lets this style take away anything. With the exaggerated villains and side characters, the film is much more comic than I expected and it is more enjoyable for it as it also then helps us be in the mindset of the samurai (to a point) by seeing it as a bit of a game - an aspect that the dry and serious tone of Last Man Standing did not have and cost it dearly as a film. It is not anything to have you rolling with laughter but it is funny. Importantly though it doesn't detract from it as an engaging game of a story and it does have plenty of action and drama as the samurai plays out his plan.In the middle of all this it would be deeply unfair not to credit the importance of Mifune in the film's success. That the character looks easy is down to him because his presence and air of cool scheming compliments and is complimented by the overall style of the film. He delivers his lines with a certain amount of cockiness, but not ever enough to be arrogant, and his body language and screen presence make him instantly engaging. He is well supported though by plenty of actors doing good work to be comic characters but also still be useful as dramatic devices (ie the villains still offer a threat even if they are quite funny); Sazanka, Kawazu, Tono, Sawamura, Watanabe etc are all good even if they do stand in the shadow of Mifune. Nakadai's Unosuke (the gunslinger) doesn't get enough credit in my opinion. To me he was important because he conveys a cool sense of menace similar to the samurai's but yet also ensures it is always mean rather than clever, brash rather than precise and based on the gun he carries rather than anything about him as a man (which is how Mifune comes across).Yojimbo has countless remakes out there for you to check out - some good, some bad, but the original stands up strong in the pack. Without any real weakness the film is almost effortless in being cool, funny, engaging and entertaining. It is worth noting that everything looks easy - the performances, the blend of comedy/drama/style, the story, they all work together so naturally that one assumes that it just happened whereas of course it is down to those involved in the making and delivery. This is a great film that is fresh, cool and entertaining and deserves to be seen by anyone who has ever seen a remake or a film which it has influenced (which is a lot of people!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a masterpiece of its own, and it was cloned to become a defining movie of another genre - the Spaghetti Western ("For a Fistfull of Dollars"). By chance I saw the two back to back (first the western, then the original), not knowing that one was a remake of the other, and I have to say: The original is better.The lighting, scenery and camera-work is very nice - right from the opening shot. Some scenes will be immediately recognizable by all movie aficionados - especially the 'Mos Eisley cantina scene' (I almost fell out of my chair, laughing). The movie emphasizes much more the characters and the plots/intrigues going on. It's all about whose plan will be successful in the end. Kurosawa even forgoes some action sequences like a big sword fight with two huge rivaling gangs, just showing the aftermath of a street strewn with bodies. If he'd wanted he could have easily turned this into an action packed blood-fest a la 'Kill Bill' right there, but he didn't - and I have to give him high praise for this. Not that 'Kill Bill' is a bad movie (quite the opposite). Just that such slaughter would not have fit the overall flow of Kurosawas work. When he shows action there is a point to it. It is to demonstrate how superior his hero is at sword fighting or how underhanded the bad guys are - not to show gory scenes of senseless violence for the pure spectacle of it (as "For a Fistfull of Dollars" would do 3 years later)This is one of his greatest films, and I can see why it has earned such high praise. Go check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very entertaining movie. I've seen the moments that inspired the Mos Eisley confrontation scene in Star Wars A New Hope. Or how Charlie Brown greets O-Ren Ishii and her body guards in Kill Bill. What was very interesting to see was our hero and how much his sword does for him, and the villain, how he feels naked without his gun.Watch for the once headstrong and arrogant kid turning yella in the end, "Go home,a long life eating porridge is best." Perfect framing and multiplanar visual storytelling with exciting moments of Sanjuro taking on multiple opponents; he sets up a scene and makes it look like 15 or 16 men did it. But the later scenes where we see our hero's slow-side indeed has impact because of how opposite and vulnerable he becomes after we've seen his audacity in early scenes.Yojimbo is Grade A in my opinion. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, Especially Regarding Characterization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Yojimbo" is the kind of movie you see on the Top 250, and think how the heck something with a title like that and something that the majority of the world's population has not heard of could make the list. It is only after watching it that you can understand the reasons.First of all, "Yojimbo" has great acting. I know none of the actors' names, but I felt that every character was in character and believable. Second, the story is great. How the suspense builds and and how the action occurs just adds to the enjoyment of watching the film. The ending is also great, and the bits of comedy added make it all the more delightful. The best part of the movie, however, was the characterization. Sanjuro's character is an amazingly deep hero who develops throughout the movie, and the other characters, although not focused on, seem to do the same.Really, I can't find too much negative here. The fact that the movie was made in another nation over forty years ago keep it from having its deepest impact on me. But overall, this film is EXCELLENT.Final Grade: A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>another quick review: Is Mifune better than De Niro, Pacino, Brando and the rest? Here he outshines all of Clint's performances in the movies this one influenced, with his one liners, and physical presence. Admittedly, the rest of the cast are not called on to do much, but both sides show themselves as desperate, and na?ve. The violence, and set pieces are subtle yet memorable, but it is Mifune's performance which carries the film. some memorable scenes, aside from the fights, are the dog with someone's hand running through town, and Mifune's exit-his wok complete. 8 out of ten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three wrongs make a right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine had been hyping up this movie to me for several months, so I finally sat down to watch it tonight. Overall, I'd have to say that it lived up to its reputation. Even though I wasn't really in the mood for it at the start, it drew me in and kept me glued to the TV screen for two full hours.I think enough people have already commented on the plot of the movie (and how cool they think Toshiro Mifune is), so I won't waste your time with more such drivel here...Instead, what interested me most about this movie tonight was how many elements of it I'd already seen before. For instance, close to the beginning of the film, Mifune's character kills a couple of henchmen and then lops off the arm of another--and then you see the poor guy's dismembered arm, lying on the ground, still holding on to his katana. It's impossible to watch this shot and not immediately think of the bloody arm that Obi-Wan has dismembered in the cantina scene in the first Star Wars movie.Elements of Star Wars are all over this film, in fact: from the moment Mifune pops out a couple of floorboards to leave his hiding place (think of Han and Luke on the Millennium Falcon) to the sweeping, horizontal wipe transitions you see between each scene. Like Obi-Wan, Mifune's "Man with No Name" is a wandering, mystic warrior--one of the last of his kind. And the mercenary element of a character like Han Solo is lived out large here, too, by Mifune's character.But that's just it. As someone has already pointed out here, this movie began the 1960s/1970s "deconstruction of the Western"--the good/bad distinction disappears, and there's just Mifune's Yojimbo to play two despicable rich men (and their cronies) off of each other. When Mifune actually does something decent for another human being in the film, it comes as kind of a shock. But at the end of the movie--when he comes back to fight the "bad" guys--he's not fighting them for any noble purpose, or to help out the poor, old townspeople. He just wants payback.This is the kind of nihilistic, beyond-good-and-evil stuff that we've seen so often (and loved so much) in action films ever since. It's not about the triumph of principle over chaos--it's about the triumph of the individual over the masses. We've seen this thing so many times by now that I think it's difficult for us to appreciate in a film that's seen so many years go by (and been copied as often) as Yojimbo. In fact, those who are looking for lots of melodramatic action sequences and overly drawn out fight scenes will probably be disappointed by this "action" movie--its violence is too curt to be really satisfying.What strikes me now, though, is that one of the reasons movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones and everything else that came out of the Lucas/Spielberg era were so successful is because they injected the old good vs. evil theme back into the Western-style movie. They just had to transfer their settings to places far away from the American West. It's like--after Kurosawa and Leone and Eastwood and Don Siegel had had their say--we had to go somewhere else besides the Old West to get what we were really looking for.There's no such triumph of good over evil here. Just one badass dude making the best of a bad situation. Check it out if that's the sort of thing you want to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune were certaintly at their peak when they made this film. A model for the deconstruction of the "Western" genre and the prototype for Leone's A Fistful of Dollars among other films. Even Mifunes' performance has been lifted by Eastwood for his own persona in his laconic, "supremely cool" anti hero roles. Beautifully filmed in black &amp; white Kurosawa manages to achieve an almost lyrical, poetic quality of film making. The action is hypnotic with a perfectly blend of humor and pathos. Stunning on all accounts. I got to see a new print of this film along with several others at a Kurosawa/ Mifune retrospective recently which only enhances the quality of these films by seeming them on a large screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The man with the wildest eye-rolling on earth, Toshiro Mifune, acts rather cool in this samurai western. Did you ever want to know where Clint Eastwood's cigar in the corner of the mouth stems from? Where Sergio Leone took all the sandy desert wind as background of the lonesome hero, facing a violent crowd? Where the nameless heroes had their debut, cynical, silent saints and killers in an evil world where only the victims deserve sympathy? A fine, twisted plot (sometimes confused ... or did a few scenes miss in the rotten copy I saw?) keeps the suspense until the showdown.

Toshiro Mifune is, as always, superb in the leading role as a masterless samurai who plays two rival gangs off against each other. His portrayal of the strong but kind samurai rivals his great performance in Seven Samurai.

		<fullReview>Personally my favourite Kurosawa movie and obviously one of his more influential works. The story centres itself around a Ronin (Toshiro Mifune), and how he spends his time moving back and forth between two rival gangs in a small village. I'm sure you know the plot by now (we've all seen "A Fistful of Dollars"), but the points that really stand out for me are performances and the incredible use of light and shadow by Kurosawa. The film has some absolute gems as far as classic scenes are concerned. I mean who has not seen a dog in a movie running down a road with a hand in its mouth? It's been used a number of times but once again it was Kurosawa who sowed the seed.The film is full of humour, but at the same time carries a certain seriousness, and we get to see the full scope of Mifune's acting ability. The action scenes are as always superb, quite often over before you can visually digest what has happened and they constantly have you reaching for the rewind button.Breathtaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Yojimbo" is one of the coolest samurai flicks from the one and only Akira Kurosawa and it's also starring Japanese acting legend Toshiro Mifune as a wandering ronin who plays two warring gangster fashions against one another. "Yojimbo" is my Christmas present and my introduction to the mind of Japanese wonder-kind Kurosawa, who injects enough black humor and violence into the picture to make it a one-of-a-kind viewing experience. The West has gotten a translated taste of Kurosawa from "A Few Dollars More" (1964) with Clint Eastwood and director Sergio Leone. Ironically enough, "Yojimbo" was Kurosawa's take on the western genre, and so it's no wonder Leone got his hands on it.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film opens with Toshirô Mifune navigating through a corn field. Slowly he is revealed to us and even his walk seems very self-confident and tough.Text on-screen informs us he is a Japanese ronin - now without a master due to Japanese civil war, he has turned into a bounty hunter and roams the countryside.Soon he wanders into a town and gets a job as a bodyguard. And then he hatches a brilliant idea to play two towns against each other for his own advantage."Yojimbo" is one of Akira Kurosawa's most popular films to arrive in the States, and only a couple years after its release (which was extremely successful in Japan) "spaghetti western" director Sergio Leone remade the film (without credit to Kurosawa) as "For a Few Dollars More," the second film in the well-regarded "Dollars" trilogy.Both films are very good (you can find my review on "Dollars" on IMDb also) but "Yojimbo" has its own superior traits. His direction is superb (but then again so is Leone's) - some of the shots in "Yojimbo" are so carefully structured it's hard to imagine even the most minute elements were incidental; everything seems planned.Toshirô Mifune is perfect as the antihero of the movie who we root for despite being a somewhat shady and ignorant character.If you liked "For a Few Dollars More," do yourself a favor and check out the original version - you may like it better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While not perfect, Kurosawa/Mifune and that guy with the pistol make this movie work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some spoilers) 'Yojimbo' marks the fourth Kurosawa film that I've seen, and so far, I'd have to say it's the weakest compared to the previous viewings ('The Hidden Fortress, 'Seven Samura' and 'Throne ofBlood')! Though, saying that, it's still pretty good, and worth checking out, but it is harder to get into and isn't that compelling until the second half. Also, I thought, besides Mifune's character in the Bodyguard, there wasn't really an array of interesting characters in this movie. In fact, the main and most interesting villain, a pistol-loving Unosoke (Tatsuya Nakadai) does appear until the second half and he isn't really given that much depth.The story of 'Yojimbo' revolves around a wandering Samurai (Toshiro Mifune) who enters a town run by two gangs. Basically, he plays them against each other and pits his services to the highest bidder, and he sneakily undermines whoever his current employer is. Mifune is excellent, and his screen presence is undeniable. The stark black and white cinematography adds to this sometimes very tense face off as well as the build up to it, and its eventual ultimate dramatic conclusion. You can definitely see this film being remade into a Western, and although I haven't seen the remake in 'A Fistful of Dollars', 'Yojimbo' does have a kind of Western feel to it- especially with the showdown at the end, as well as the main villain is carrying his beloved pistol. The climax of this film, and the events leading towards it, really won me over with this movie, but the pacing in the beginning can be a tad slow. It'll be interesting to see what Leone did with the remake. Another great thing about 'Yojimbo' is the soundtrack, and some of the humour. Now, I need to see 'Sanjuro'! 'Yojimbo' is essential Kurosawa,and I still need to see more of this talented filmmaker's movies. While, I don't think it's the best of the ones I've seen, it's definitely worth a look if you're into Japanese cinema. Though, if you haven't seen 'Seven Samurai', I recommend that before 'Yojimbo'. However, if you starting out like me with Kurosawa and have seen 'Seven Samurai', then 'Yojimbo' is an essential flick to see from his resume!***? out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, irreverant, satirical and engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody ever talks about Kurosawa's sense of humor, it seems. But there are scenes in this ironic samurai romp that would do Mel Brooks proud--chief among them the brilliant sequence where the two factions TRY to fight each other in the streets but keep retreating from one another out of cowardice."Yojimbo" is, in fact, a pretty well-disguised satire that's not usually discussed as such. Though not as cynical as Leone's remake, "A Fistful of Dollars," "Yojimbo" is still a jaded reimagining of the samurai as an irreverant, self-interested mercenary. The war between the silk and sake factions of the small town is in essence a pathetic comedy of errors, and Sanjuro's systematic annihilation of both sides, though probably largely deserved, is a sort of exaggerated, bloody prank.Of course, Kurosawa's patient, steady-as-a-rock direction helps to create an air of serious drama for the film, which serves to make the satire even more sophisticated.A special film to say the least--"Yojimbo" is fun to watch on pretty much every level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yojimbo (The Bodyguard)Sanjuro is a ronin, a samurai without a master, walking around trying to find peace. He arrives to a town divided by two gangs, one produces Silk, the other produces Sake. The Town is divided between them, both are they fighting for the being the one gang in charge, the fight has lasted long and has killed almost all business in town, except the one making coffins for all the corpses the war produces. Sanjuro wants to help, offers to help both of them depending on who will pay him the highest fee. But his real intention is to play the gangs against each other to free the town from them.My long awaited first Kurosawa experience, and i do admit, there is no doubt he is a rare genius. This story is just so well told, perfectly balanced the movie never fails to be interesting, all the way through it kept me interested, wanting to see the progress. Pure perfection. It's one of those movies where i thought afterwards how perfectly paced it was, every second is there for a reason, there isn't a second to much, or a second to little, fantastic. Also the movie, despite being very old, is actually still today very watchable, although it hasn't aged as well as some other old movies i have seen. I can still see where many modern movies have gotten the inspiration from, the amount of scenario you can recognize here is absolutely admirable, and there has also been much talk about the storyline directly have inspired a great director like Sergio Leone, to make his western triumph "A Fistful of Dollars".Kurosawa is the genius in this movie, in a movie that is so well construction you can tell this movie was made by a creative genius, but also a man who constantly seeked for perfection, every thing in the movie seem to be thought so well through, every little sequence. One great piece in the movie directing wise is the stunning use of the a confusing touch to the movie, the windy, cold, dirty roads of the town, it's just so well portrayed.I haven't seen many old Japanese movies, but the acting here is brilliant, i love the passion that exists in the Japanese language. Toshiro Mifune is quite fantastic in the leading role, but i think all of the cast gives a very good performance, and there isn't a flaw to put on any of them. Especially the wife to Seibei i thought was fantastic in portraying the cold, evil and brutal women, that she played.To up it up. This movie is almost a perfect construction. Furthermore the movie has inspired decades of movies, truly admirable. I was very surprised to see how well such an old movie manages to keep my interest up nearly all the way through, it's really a well balanced movie that never manages to get boring at all. But even though i have a lot of praise for the movie, it didn't get all the way through me, i wasn't stunned afterwards, i didn't want to become a samurai and a Japanese, that is what makes me not giving it a top grade. But i still found it a very good movie that portrayed many sides of the human mind, greed, anger, fear, evil, but most important we also got to see how Sanjuro, the fearsome Samurai, also had a heart of gold with his intention of helping the innocent in people in the village.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I can definitely see why this movie caused a huge cultural influence in America. Yojimbo is nothing short of an incredible action movie that never gets boring and never lets up. Some of the parts of this movie compare so well to modern action films that I actually thought this movie ranks in my top 10 action movies of all time.Like "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," Yojimbo is an opera of cheesiness. The acting is good in a loud way, and there are certain characters that have no place in reality, but a welcome home in the world of movies. (That huge, ugly bastard.) Toshiro Mifune has consistently been a commanding prescence on the screen in every Kurosawa film that I have seen, and each performance I watch makes me love him more and more. In this film, he plays a gruffy old samurai, but with a different edge than that of Sanjuro. In Sanjuro, the lead character is more of an unconventional leader, using cleverness as his main weapon, and the sword only when necessary. This is still the same sort of character that he plays in Yojimbo, however, in this film he has a much more brutal air about him. Sanjuro left you feeling like he was a restrained individual. Yojimbo left you feeling a little awed by the sheer power that he could unleash.As far as the plot goes, this movie is about as perfect as you can get to suit my needs. Basically, a man who calls himself Sanjuro comes into town for a few days. When he leaves, everyone is dead. What's not to love? But seriously... This movie is about a town that is torn by two rival gangs. When the no-named Samurai comes in, he manages to use his skillful swordplay to manipulate the two sides so they destroy each other. And in the end, everyone dies!! Glee! Glee!This film was so thoroughly fun and funny that I was laughing the entire length of the movie. The final showdown was so incredible and different from any sort of action climax I have seen that it made a serious mark in my brain. When I was watching it, I got a vibe that I had seen this level of bad assness in another movie before, but I couldn't really remember where. What made it so good was the entire development of all the characters. I love that feeling where the bad guys are set up so much that you just love to watch them get their asses kicked.Toshirio Mifune's character of "the man with no name" is definitely the best part of the film. He has the dark humor and stage prescence to really pull this role off and make it work to a maximum. I also found the way that he gets his "name" to be a wonderful touch to the movie as well. He says his name is "Sanjuro," which means he is 30 years old. He then looks out into the distance and sees a mulberry field. "Sanjuro Kuwabatake," he says. Kuwabatake means mulberry field in Japanese.There are so many great little touches to this movie that are so classic in and of themselves. In the beginning of the film, Sanjuro throws a stick into the air. The stick points a direction, so, Sanjuro walks that direction. Truly a man with no purpose for living. This, among many other moments, make the movie so fun and fresh that you never get bored while watching.The GOODS: Fun, inventive, and downright ass-kicking. I am definitely taking a shine to black and white movies. Since I was raised with color, I used to prefer movies that are in color. After seeing Kurosawa use the black and white as an entirely different medium of putting film onto the screen, utilizing the actual lack of color, I have been gaining an entirely different respect for black and white. Yojimbo is a black and white film, which drains the color from the film and replaces it with a dusty feeling, like a western. I think Yojimbo would not have been the same movie if it had been in color.The BADS: Yojimbo, much like "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly," is filled with cheese. It is a fantastic film in the sense that it is borderline fantasy. I do not really look at this to be a bad thing, but there are cerain audiences who don't enjoy watching cheese on film.The overall story pretty much stands: If you like a good adventure story, and you like to be entertained, go see Yojimbo. I found it to be engaging and never boring. This movie zoomed to my alltime favorites list, being a perfectly crafted, fast paced, fun adventure that will only leave you feeling giddy and wishing that YOU were a nameless samurai. Hands down 4 stars.</fullReview>

In fact, I really enjoyed his movies that, yes, were NOT about samurai! Hakuchi (The Idiot) and Tengoku To Jigoku (High And Low) I thought were both better than this one, but I'm not putting down Yojimbo at all. It was a very nice watch in terms of both plot and style, and of course spectacular direction by Kurosawa and acting by Mifune. I also enjoyed the way this movie really seemed like a Western, as this movie was both influenced by past Westerns and influenced future Westerns. Very nice flow to the film.

		<fullReview>This movie was really cool!! The samurai's idea of getting rid of the gamblers were excellent!! The story was very manly and also exciting. I liked the intersection of the samurai and the gamblers and fighting in the sand storm. I also liked the main character, nameless samurai. He acts tough but inside, he fights for the justice and not greedy. If it was one of "Independence Movie" stuff, it would be laughable bnut Mifune plays it very realistically. After this movie, there are many heroic characters modeled after him, Han Solo, Indiana Jones, etc, but no one is more realistic and better than the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie much better than the two remakes - the one with Clint Eastwood, and the newer one with Bruce Willis. If you liked this one at all, you should check out Sanjuro - also by Akira Kurosawa. They are both old and both subtitled, but the swordplay and customs are very historically accurate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing feudal piece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 11/14/2009 - 3 out of 10 (Dir- Akira Kurosawa): Confusing feudal piece about an old samurai warrior coming into a town and causing confusion between the parties leading to greater destruction because of it. Toshiro Mifune plays the samurai who kind of plays with both parties and tricks them into hating each other even more by his manipulative ways. Initially, it's a little comedic how he plays with them but them he gets beaten up and the innocent get thrown into the mix and the humor leaves. This movie is really hard to follow because it's hard to identify each party as unique. One group are gamblers and the others are protectors of a brothel. The town obviously has no real presence of authority but the drifter doesn't bring any of that into play by being there. I'm assuming that this is because the wars are over and there is no one in power. I'm sure it would help to understand a little of the Japanese history to understand this movie -- unfortunately I have none. The movie really becomes pretty brutal and those left standing are just lucky -- I guess. Mifune's portrayal is a little confusing as well as he kind of snickers at both sides until he's beaten up and then he takes things into his own hands. A much heralded Japanese director in Akira Kurasawa made this film but I'm sorry I just didn't get the appeal of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A world of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Yojimbo' is a world of fun. Everything in it, from the quirky characters to the zany atmosphere without forgetting the bombastic soundtrack or the trademark action scenes, goes into creating a very entertaining movie. There is nothing cult-like about it, instead there is highly competent production that is truly gripping. The Western movie vibes draw attention a particular Japanese point of view without making it difficult to be enjoyed by a broader audience.In being so immediate in the way even a casual viewer can apprehend it 'Yojimbo' runs the risk of not being appreciated for the innovative movie it was. I watched a documentary with some of the people involved in making it and it was delightful to see how enthusiastic they still were decades after. It also showed how the techniques that went into filming and the sound effects were so ground breaking at the time. Kuorosawa also built an entire town down to the most minute of details and went to great lengths to achieve the dust blowing in the wind effect.The result is a movie that aged beautifully and that pointed in the direction that would be followed by so many. This timeless appeal is one of the reasons why 'Yojimbo' is such an overall hit on all fronts. Gripping and just fun. It is always wonderful to be entertained by a movie that is genuinely well done, beautifully crafted and to simply relax to something that is not a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yojimbo is an example of timeless Japanese cinema, something that will continue to entertain generations after generations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's most well-known film in Japan inspired several similar remakes such as the popular A Fistful Of Dollars helmed by Western legend Sergio Leone, and the forgettable Last Man Standing starring Bruce Willis. Ironically, Yojimbo is said to be Kurosawa's tribute to the Western genre. The film is pure Kurosawa - spectacular action, artistry, and dark humor combined. Apart from The Hidden Fortress, and Seven Samurai, this is one of the most entertaining of Kurosawa's films.Toshiro Mifune, the leading man in almost a dozen Kurosawa films, gives a vivid performance as an unemployed samurai who decides to act as a 'law enforcer' in a town under siege by gangs. Yojimbo starts memorably with a dog scampering across the street with a dislocated human hand between its teeth, a jolting sequence that prepares viewers for the onslaught of violence seen later in the film. Filmed in beautiful black-and-white, Yojimbo outstandingly recaptures a bygone era - nostalgic Japanese setting with western stylistic hues.There some parts (especially in the middle) that drags for quite long, which if edited cleverly would have made Yojimbo feel tighter, and consequently, more engrossing. But this minor flaw is eclipsed by Kurosawa's astute direction and his revered ability with the camera (which is always moving, and covering different angles). Yojimbo is an example of timeless Japanese cinema, something that will continue to entertain generations after generations. It's not Kurosawa's best effort, but there's no denying the fact that it's a visual delight.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beauty and grandeur you'd expect from Akira Kurosawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yojimbo is a classic film from the genius mind of Akira Kurosawa. It was influenced by many of the American spaghetti western films coming out in this time period, and was the influence of A Fistful of Dollars (1964), one of Clint Eastwood's breakout roles. Yojimbo tells the story of a wise and mysterious samurai named Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshirô Mifune) who arrives in a small village in the wake of destruction because of two rival gangs. Sanjuro decides that to save the innocent commoners of the village, he will play the gangs against each other to the point of demise. His plan comes with ups and downs and an exciting story unravels with gripping action and compelling characters.Akira Kurosawa was a genius at what he did, and this shows through the level of delicate intricacy woven into the plot and visual aesthetic of Yojimbo. Every shot is flawless. He was a master of long drawn out shots that allow the actors to act and the story to unfold more like a stage play than a film. Yojimbo is a beautiful film in it's own slow and delicate way. What Kurosawa is able to achieve with such limited technology, and upon such a simple backdrop is truly phenomenal. The entirety of the film is a visual joy to watch.Kurosawa was also a master of compelling storytelling. Yojimbo plays out as a fun and exciting adventure story about a likable samurai with all the essential hero qualities, as well as the qualities of the unconventional hero. Sanjuro is very wise and quick on his feet, he is an impressive character to watch and Toshirô Mifune's performance keeps you constantly interested in what the character has to say or do. Yojimbo may not seem like it is a groundbreaking film the does the unthinkable and pushes the boundaries of conventional storytelling, yet it was for its time. Just like most of Kurosawa's films, the story sets the stage for many films to come in the future. It is these future films that push the limits of what Kurosawa and other older filmmakers established. They have to, or else they are forgotten in the sea of films with such a similar storyline.Yojimbo is stunning and exciting in every way. It is a classic film on a grand and epic scale. It's archetypes and processes of storytelling have lasted for generations and most likely will last for many more to come. In the back catalog of movies that began a new era of filmmaking and storytelling, Yojimbo is a fantastic example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yojimbo is both a brilliant reworking of the samurai genre and arguably director Akira Kurosawa's most influential work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Toshiro Mifune gives the finest performance of his stellar career as Sanjuro, a bored, flea-bitten, and thoroughly amoral ronin who possesses almost superhuman swordsmanship. He offers his fighting skills to two rival gangs of cutthroats to trick them into destroying one another.Yojimbo is a masterful, beautifully composed , witty film that inspired the 'Spaghetti Western' cycle when it was remade by Sergio Leone as A Fistful Of Dollars. Dark humour is balanced in the film by other moments approaching slapstick. From the Sanjuro's final duel with young gun-toting thug Unosuke to the single grotesque image of a dog clutching a human hand at the film's outset, Yojimbo crackles with a dynamic energy that rivets and entertains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Kurosawa's best pictures. If not his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa is probably the most famous Japanese director of all time. Even a person that doesn't study cinema, she probably have watched a Kurosawa flick or at least heard of him. But this doesn't happen just for any reason. In his career, there are all-time classics, such as 'Ran', 'Dreams', 'Rashomon', 'Kagemusha' and many others. Most of his movies, specially his early ones, such as 1957's 'Seven Samurai', introduced many concepts that are used in Hollywood nowadays, specially in action movies. Another picture quite important for Kurosawa's career and the movie industry in general is 'Yojimbo', from 1961. This movie is widely considered as one of Kurosawa's best pictures. If not his best.'Yojimbo's story is set in the late-19th century. It tells the story of Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshirô Mifune), a samurai without a master, that drifts without any specific destination. He arrives in a small village, dominated by two lords: Seibei (Seizaburô Kawazu), who produces silk, and Ushitora (Ky? Sazanka), who produces sake. Those two lords are always fighting each other, but they are both and his men to coward to make one real fight, so they just threat each other. Upon his arrival, the samurai realizes this, so he offer the services of bodyguard to both of them (thus the title, Yojimbo, which means bodyguard in Japanese). But all Sanjuro really wants is to make the fight come to an end and finally bring peace to the small town. The movie's screenplay was wrote by Kurosawa himself, with the help of Ry?zô Kikushima. It is loosely based on several stories, such as the novel 'Red harvest'. 'Yojimbo's plot may seem somewhat familiar, and that's because this story was revisited by many other directors over the years. But the screenplay is just the one problem I have with 'Yojimbo'. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and the story, just though it could be better developed, specially on the character's department. It would be nice to know some of the background story of how the town reached that situation. This would help to explain the actions of some characters, that seem somewhat shallow. But the screenplay also manages to deal with excellent subjects in a subtle way, such as the generation conflicts, innocence, cowardly, etc. Another thing that worked very well is that you really don't know what happened to Sanjuro before the events depicted on the movie. The picture already starts with him wandering in a deserted road. This happens to increase the mysteries around his character, which are never really explained. In a nutshell, a very well-written screenplay.Guess who's the leading actor in 'Yojimbo'? If you guessed Toshirô Mifune, then you are absolutely right. After all, it would be the obvious answer, because Mifune made nothing less than sixteen movies along with Akira Kurosawa. and this movie marks the twelfth collaboration between the two. And one of the best, not only because of the movie itself, which is great, but specially for Mifune's work. He had already delivered excellent performances in other Kurosawa's pictures, such as 'Seven Samurai' or 'Rashomon', but his job in 'Yojimbo' really stands out. Mifune was perfect in his role as Sanjuro. He understood the part do well that you actually believes he is the samurai. And in the scene where he is drunk is like an interpretation class for new actors. Amazing. The rest of the cast was nice also. Of course no one reached Mifune's greatness, but there wasn't one bad actor in the main or in the supporting cast.Normally in my reviews here on IMDb, this is the paragraph where I say what I tough about the direction of the movie. But there isn't much to comment on Kurosawa's directing job in 'Yojimbo'. That's because it's Kurosawa, what can I say? Everyone knows that Kurosawa is a master, the best of the best, the guy who created all the concepts we use in action movies, so I'm gonna restrict to saying this: as always, Kurosawa makes a perfect job. His direction was so great that only three years after the release of 'Yojimbo', in 1964, one of the best Italian directors of all time, Sergio Leone, made a shot-by-shot remake of the movie. But Leone's picture was set in the American Wild West, and was starred by no one less then Clint Eastwood. Leone's 'A Fistful of Dollars' is a movie as good as 'Yojimbo', and all thanks to Kurosawa. Another thing that I though it was great in 'Yojimbo' is the Soundtrack. A brilliant work by Masaru Satô. Aside from the Soundtrack, other aspect in 'Yojimbo' that really stands out is the cinematography. A beautiful work in black-and- white tones by Kazuo Miyagawa. Overral, 'Yojimbo' is one of those movies that come close to perfection. The only complain I have with it is the script, that could have been better developed in the characters' department. But this doesn't remove the glow of the movie, that has a perfect direction and an excellent acting, specially by Toshiro Mifune, in his twelfth collaboration with Akira Kurosawa, that made Yojimbo one of his best pictures. If not the best.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yojimbo (1961) **** (out of 4) Akira Kurosawa's film about a samurai (Toshiro Mifune) who goes to a small town that's been taken over by two opposing gangs and plays both sides against one another. Needless to say this film is miles ahead of countless remakes including A Fistful of Dollars and Walter Hill's Last Man Standing, which was actually the film that made me aware of this one. TBS use to run a promo about "Movies For Guys Who Like Movies" and this film here must be the movie for guys who like movies. A wonderful action film that has plenty of violence mixed in with laughs that makes it one of the all time greats. Mifune's comic timing is wonderful as is the music score that plays all the right notes. If I was to ever have to fight a dozen or so guys I'd want this score playing in the background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Feudal Japan. Small village. There's no boundary for villagers' stupidity and greed. Villagers are fire-eaters, stupid killers. They would sell their own mothers for money. But they encounter hero and everyone get what one deserve - villagers manage to kill each other - and, do they take all the possessions with them to heaven, oh sorry, hell? This village is a literal comparison to our world - it doesn't matter how much time passes by, people wouldn't change a bit. The movie shows the world in its radiant gloom with so little conscious, sincerity, trust and sympathy in it. I can't promise, but I can swear you will like this film, not because it's awesome, but because it's still topical and I'm sure it always will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good samourai"Yakuza flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People always say it was the better samurai flick of all time (with 7 Samurai). I have to admit, i not agree with that. It was a cool film (cool it's the word) and a perfect exemple of the kind of movies who was popular in Japan at this time. Chanbara (swordfight film) and Yakuza Eiga was the big deal in the 60's in Japan and this movie have all the elements. Kurosawa hate the Yakzua, it's the reason why he never made a Yakuza Eiga (to be a little bit harsh, i will say that's why critics know nothing about Yakzua Eiga, because Kurosawa never made this kind of genre altough it was one of the most popular genre in Japan). A lot of Jidai-geki with yakuza was made til 1910. But in this movie, they are ridicule and kill by Mifune.Like i said before, i dont think it's the better Kurosawa (i prefer High And Low or Rashomon) but it was funny. But i prefer Sanjuro, the sequel.The fact this movie have all this influence (people who disagree are blind) it's because it's one of the only chanbara we saw in occident. Chanbara was a genre very popular in japan, a very cool genre. But it's was one of the only of this kind. 7 Samurai or Rashomon was not chanbara, just jidai-geki.What my point? I think if another chanbara was show to us at this time, the people was enjoy it too. And maybe more. because in term of fun and quality, a lot of chanbara can be name. The Zatoichi serie or Nemury Kyoshiro (The first 3 films was a little bit boring for many people, but watch til the 4 episode.. it was very disturbing) or some Okamoto movies like Samurai Assassin with Mifune. And many directore like Kenji Misumi made a good technic work. and if you want deep drama and chanbara, i suggest Harakiri by Kobayashi.Yojimbo it's a fair movie to me, but not the greatest masterpiece of all time... It's my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good they (re) made it twice!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yojimbo (the bodyguard) is set approximately two hundred years ago in Japan, during a time of chaos. The film starts with the central character, a Ronin (landless Samurai)at a crossroads. He squats down and spins a bottle. When it stops, he takes the direction indicated. There is a town at war. Two rival factions, each owning factories of some description, have hired mercenaries and criminals and are busy attempting to wipe each other out whilst the ordinary villagers are caught in the middle. The Ronin finds this amusing and starts to play both sides against the middle, first demonstrating his skill by killing a number of mercenaries (Cooper...three coffins *pause* *look* maybe four.....) and accepting one rival's bid and then leaving and accepting the other, leaving also a trail of uncertainty and worry in his wake. The Ronin is unshaven, unwashed and very, very skillful - a shark among minnows. He is also sardonic, sarcastic and gives the appearance of caring nothing. But from time to time, a glimmer of honour and belief shines, albeit briefly before being covered up once more. I won't go into more specific detail about this film lest I ruin it for those that have yet to see it. The director is Akira Kurasawa, the main actor Toshiiro Mifune, two of the best reasons for seeing this film. It was subsequently remade by Morricone as "a fistful of dollars". His initial claim that he was remaking Fellini's "a servant of two masters" held water for precisely two seconds. It has more recently been remade as "last man standing" - both films shallow copies of the original. See it - tape it - buy it.Dan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great homage to the American Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the easiest Kurosawa masterpieces to watch, and like previous classics from this legendary director, the action of the story occurs in medevial Japan. Ironically, this tale was inspired by the American Western (which is clearly evident)and inspired an important chapter of the Western genre. Later remade as Sergio Leone's "A Fistful of Dollars" (which led to "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and "Once Upon A Time In The West"), Akira Kurosawa's medevial "western" is just as enjoyable, violent and stylish as Clint Eastwood's "spaghetti" Western that most movie fans are familair with. It is rare that a film and its subsequent re-make can be equally enjoyable and of equal quality, but such is the case. In Kurosawa's original, Toshiro Mifune portrays "The Man With No Name" and is just as mysterious, witty and sarcastic as that tough, skinny American. Fans of Leone's Westerns would be very wise to witness this great film. Comparisons are pretty futile since both are of different cultural settings and the action in both are exceedingly excellent. But it is such a great story and a great film to watch, an admirer certainly won't mind to witness two great versions of the same terrific formula."Yojimbo" was again re-made in the 90's with Bruce Willis in "Last Man Standing".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of Kurosawa's most exciting gems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way, Clint Eastwood may owe the success of his career (or at least the moment of success in his career) not to director Sergio Leone and a movie called "A Fistful of Dollars", but rather to a Japanese movie called "Yojimbo" and a man named Akira Kurosawa. For those not familiar with the tale of copyright controversy, "A Fistful of Dollars" is really an unauthorized remake of "Yojimbo", which led Kurosawa to successfully sue Leone for copying his film. Now the heat has since calmed down and Kurosawa admitted he enjoyed "A Fistful of Dollars" and considered it a worthy remake. However, comparing the two films, it is obvious: the original is the best.We usually associate the plot of a sneering gun for hire playing the two crime bosses of a town against each other with "A Fistful of Dollars", but it started with "Yojimbo." The only difference is, "A Fistful of Dollars" is set in 18th century America, "Yojimbo" is post-civil war Japan and the squinting protagonist is a samurai, not a gunfighter. So here we have a ronin (Toshiro Mifune) who wanders into a negligent town that is run by two gangs constantly at war with each other. Seeing a window for opportunity, the samurai who never gives his true name, starts to swap loyalty between the two sides and play them against each other to save the town?and put some weight in his pockets.This is a classic samurai tale and one of Akira Kurosawa's best. Clint Eastwood may have immortalized the idea of a man without a name, but Toshiro Mifune as the samurai depicts a textbook example of the character. Mifune is playing the exact opposite of the goofy, deliberately comical character he played in "Seven Samurai" and gives a performance that is regularly regarded as one of the best of all time by any actor. In addition, Kurosawa's film is also a milestone for the influence it had not on other Japanese films, but in the Americas and in the Western genre. Many elements that we find commonplace in the Western idiom started here.And the ultimate reason why "Yojimbo" works and why it is so influential and popular is because it is two hours of sheer excitement. Kurosawa may have ended his career depicting violence as horrible and gut-wrenching in films such as "Kagemusha" (1980) and more notable, "Ran" (1985), but here he showed it as being wild and not so harrowing. To some people's dismay, this film may be the one that started the chain of movies that glorified violence, but Kurosawa does it with restraint so that an impression of killing and being killed being scary does make its point toward the end, but only after the nameless ronin has sliced up several people with his katana."Yojimbo" is a very well-made action picture that rests somewhere between the extremes of being lighthearted and being dark and poignant. It is a shame that it does not receive so much praise in the West, because after all, half the action pictures of today and a significant number of the Western movies do borrow or homage it in some way.Rating: 4/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's classic INSPIRATION for western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Fistful of Dollars" was released 3 years AFTER "Yojimbo", which goes to say the the Sergio Leone picture was an uncredited lift of Kurosawa's masterpiece. Not only that, "Yojimbo" was remade again in the nineties as Walter Hill's "Last Man Standing", starring Bruce Willis in this gangster era tribute to Kurosawa's true topic inspiring the metaphorical statement of this darkly satiric piece; the rising of organized crime(Yakusa) and its influence over contemporary Japan's economy.Often heralded as Kurosawa's best photographed film (with "Rashomon" DP Migawa), this 1870's era tale of a wandering Samourai's meandering's in a small silk/gambling community's struggle for control is easily considered a must-see for not only Kurosawa fans, but for anyone considering themselves true fans of the art of cinema. Not to mention that it was also cool enough of a movie to jet-propel Clint Eastwood's Spagetti Westerns career.Another stellar performance from Toshiro Mifune as the master swordsman, and worldwide acclaim for this film resulted in a sequel, "Sanjuro"(1962).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exchange the swords for six-shooters and the Japanese clothing for jeans, boots and shirts, and you have The Perfect Western! A "Nameless Man" wanders into town, a town split by two gangs, and since he is a man with certain talents for fighting, both gangs want to hire him. I did find some hiccups in the translation from Japanese to English; the gangs were referred to as "gamblers" and the coffin-maker was called a "cooper"--a barrel maker. I don't know if this is the original translation or if it was changed when they remastered the film. The film rolls along at a good clip, without much lagging. It isn't constant action, it does take time to set up some characterization. Which is good: I hate films that treats all the actors like props. "A Fist Full Of Dollars" is almost a direct copy of this movie, except for one thing: "Yojimbo" has a sense of humor. There are plenty of lighter scenes that either make you laugh out loud, or at least chuckle. There is one picky point: I wish someone would have taken the tag out of "Nameless Man's" costume. The poor man spent the whole movie struggling with his costume, trying to make it stop itching him. Otherwise, it is a Must-See for those who are studying the Western Genere', for it inspired a change in that genere'.</fullReview>

Wonderful acting, fine cinematography, beautiful costumes, and some nice humor as well. It moves at a wonderfully deliberate pace, which does not bore but instead makes you hungry for more intrigue and suspense. This film was the inspiration for `A Fistful of Dollars' and many others to follow (`Last Man Standing'), but it has never been done quite as well. Not Kurosawa's best film but fairly close to it. Followed by a sequel, `Sanjuro,' in 1962. Nominated for Academy Award for Best Costume Design ? Black and White</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously, anyone who knows anything about Japanese cinema has to know about Akira Kurosawa. And if they know about only a few of his movies, then "Yojimbo" has to be in there. The plot almost seems like something out of a western ("A Fistful of Dollars" was in fact based on this movie), but is played to good effect. Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshiro Mifune) is a samurai who comes to a town where some gangs have a stranglehold on everything. So, he decides to play them off against each other.Okay, so maybe "Yojimbo" isn't anything special in the grand scheme of things, but it's just neat how they did everything in this movie. So watch it; you're sure to like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To anyone who hasn't seen Yojimbo, A Fistful of Dollars was a great film. To anyone (honest) who has seen Yojimbo, A Fistful of Dollars is still a great film. But will anyone admit it? There only seem to be about two honest reviewers on this site. Although Fistful helped me to understand a little of what was going on, I still didn't understand most of it. I wouldn't have understood anything at all if I hadn't seen Clint and Leone. Towards the end, try as I might, I couldn't help skipping chunks, and I'm sure I didn't miss anything. Mifune had quite good presence, and he had a very healthy appetite and was very thirsty. There was at least one pretty girl. And there was a remarkable midget holding an enormous mallet. Sorry folks, that was it for me. At some future time, when I'm feeling really strong and masochistic, I'll try again, with the commentary option to explain it to me and tell me why it's so fabulous.

		<shortDescription>highly overrated samauri film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>honestly the main character reminded me more of a belushi than a masterless swordsman. the action was short, fast, and not good. the only redeeming quality was the main character was always calm and controlled even when confronted. i will not be renting the sequel. i give it 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful. Just Awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever heard of the Emperor's new clothes? Everyone praising; no one able to admit the truth? This is the fifth Kurosawa film I have seen, and once again, it disappoints on a monumental level. Boring story, Slow pacing, mediocre acting, and yes I'll say it: poor directing. Listening to endless dialoge exposition and then watching action scenes consisting of characters running around like the Keystone Cops just isn't an artistic contribution to the hallmark of great film. I really wonder if others would continue to say they like this film if no one was watching them. I enjoy foreign films and watch a few dozen every year, but I will never, EVER waste another minute of my life watching a Kurosawa film. Don't be duped -- Avoid!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie thats best ideas have been copied to death. Watch Darth Maul wait for Obi- one behind the red energy curtain and tell me that didn't come directly from this movie. And that's the real problem. Why watch a movie that has nothing original in it which is worth watching? It's all been better done since. The dialogue sounds like a 1970s British costume drama (I speak Japanese so I know what I'm talking about) and the subtitling is simply dire. This is the 'Kind of Blue' of movies- no one has actually watched it (no one has listened to the Miles Davis album) but everyone says its the best movie they've ever seen. Avoid. 4/10</fullReview>
