		<shortDescription>Unfairly trashed actioner from a master director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot summary: In a prohibition era update of Yojimbo, Bruce Willis shoots a load of gangsters.First off I will never understand why Walter Hill does not have a better reputation. He's probably best known for his commercial success with the 48 Hrs films, and his other brilliant features get criminally overlooked. He scored a cult hit with "The Warriors", he delivered one of the best westerns ever with "The Long Riders", and put all other car chase movies to shame with the ultra cool "The Driver." As anyone who has seen these films should realise, Hill should be mentioned in the same breath as Peckinpah, Woo and Rodriguez when it comes to slow-mo gunplay."Last Man Standing" doesn't rival these earlier works, but it is a tough, gritty film with some fantastic shootouts. It doesn't hold itself back in terms of blood and violence, something current US films of the genre are guilty of doing. It has everything an action film needs; tough antihero, loath able bad guys, a creepy main villain and plenty of cannon fodder. As long as you don't get hung up on technicalities (ie the guns fire ten times more ammo than they hold) you should be entertained.It doesn't feel like any effort went into the screenplay, but Hill adds some nice touches to the film in terms of nods towards the source material. I particularly like the opening where Bruce spins his empty whisky bottle on the ground to decide which road to take; a clear reference to Toshiro Mifune throwing a stick into the air to decide on his path. There is also an interesting cast; there's earlier Hill collaborator Bruce Dern (The memorable villain from The Driver), William Sanderson (Blade Runner) and of course Christopher Walken, who chews the scenery talking tough with his hoarse accent and threatening people with a Tommy gun. His performance is really the most memorable thing about the film. Willis is not Mifune or Eastwood, but he does suit the mysterious drifter character well and this is one of his better action man roles.All things said, the film certainly doesn't come close to "Yojimbo", but it does give the more rough hewn "Fistful of Dollars" a run for its money. By no means a masterpiece, "Last Man Standing" should still provide enough for any action fans tired of watered down mainstream Hollywood nonsense that currently dilutes cinemas. It is certainly a lot better than its reputation makes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish Mayhem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply what the above headline states: an ultra-violent movie done is stylish cinematography. Walter Hill, a nasty director who does this sort of thing (violent, profane films but usually with great visual appeal) did it in spades on this one. This is testosterone gone berserk.....and very entertaining.Actually, I enjoy watching this film and don't apologize for it, although it has no "redeeming qualities." However, I love the old-fashioned narration, here done by Bruce Willis in great Mickey Spillane/Mike Hammer-style, the period in which it's done (1930s) and the great colors in here. Love those orange colors!! This looks tremendous on DVD with a good flat-screen set.If I'm feeling in the need of seeing a violent crime film, this usually fills the bill. It's a fun flick. I could do worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a bit of an oddity. A remake of a remake, the story is so obvious you are never surprised by events, but the gunfights are pretty entertaining and Christopher Walken's turn as the husky baddie Hickey is suitably menacing. Also the fact that the attractive brunette has a completely pointless scene where she is topless in front of the mirror is a bonus. :) The camera work is stylish and the discordant guitar riffage of Mr.Ry Cooder is superb, the pace is slow but not sluggish and you can almost feel the heat and dust. This film is good but not great. Er... that's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Willis doing The Red Harvest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a Gangster remake of Clint East Wood's A Fistful of Dollars which is a Western remake of Yojimbo which is a samurai adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's The Red Harvest. When adapting the first time Akira Kurosawa changed the amount of gangs involved from 4 to 2. Every version since then has had only 2. The Continental Op, The Man With No Name, Mifune's Samurai, and Bruce Willis's John Smith. All Nameless. All working all sides to their own end.As this is the only gangster version of this story, I like this movie very much, though I would like to see a more accurate version of the Red Harvest. When deciding who should play the Continental Op, none come to mind more than Bruce Willis, which of course brings me back to liking Last Man Standing. Not as pretty as those that came before, but pretty cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, masculine entertainment handicapped by one flawed sequence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This brutal Walter Hill pic has one of the best beatings ever burned to celluloid. It is so brutal, in fact, that the victim (Bruce Willis) looks like Jason from "Friday The 13th" once his attackers get done with him. Even better, he then lurches around like Rondo Hatten in "The Creep Man" plotting his revenge.The film's final action scene is an awful, indescribable mess, and I have always wondered why Hill and usual editor Freeman Davies opted to construct it this way. It is a shootout presented in a series of dissolves, and it just doesn't work. Hill has always been an adroit director and editor of action, and his fine work has a precision to it that this sequence lacks. Perhaps the camera negatives were damaged or the studio ordered a truncation. Whatever the reasons are for this flawed sequence, it, unfortunately, turns a great movie into a good movie.The opening sequence, replete with Ry Cooder's smooth scoring, is poetic and beautiful; Willis's arrival in town is directed with skill and energy; and cudos are also in order for the scene in which the first shot is fired and a stuntman is sent flying through a door into the dusty street outside.Christopher Walken is fantastic as the violent enforcer Hickey, and it is great to see David Patrick Kelly back on the screen as the malicious Doyle.There are many standout sequences and much to enjoy. Willis's solitary siege of a brothel, for example, is classic Hill stuff in terms of its staging, unapologetic brutality and superb cutting.That the film is a remake of a remake is of no consequence to me. It is still a rousing, spare piece of masculine entertainment with a whiff of Peckinpah, a dash of Kurosawa, and a splatter of Corbucci.That ain't no bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've become a big fan of Walter Hill's movies and this one is as good as ever. It's not a particularly cheery film, but it's still enjoyable. Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are both terrific in their roles. Walken plays as good a bad guy as ever, and Willis is good as the ambiguous lead character.The gun battles are staged excellently and the music by Ry Cooder works very well with the picture. It's very much a guy film, though. There are only two women who play big parts in the film, but they don't appear very often.I give LMS 7/10. It's a moody piece but enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Gangster Action Movie and Actors/Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Bruce Willis's character and the supporting cast chosen noting Walken(Hickey)and Kelly(Doyle). They really made the characters interesting to the audience and they deserve much credit for doing such a good job in this older film. I have seen many of Willis's movies and say this one is underrated and unique. In addition, it was well written with many twists to the plot, keeping you on the edge of your seat. If you are an action movie shoot them up fan, like gangster type movies and appreciate the older scenery of the pre 1930's. I would recommend this movie highly. Kudos to those who made this movie as I rate it as one of my all time favorites.Nick Milone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>farewell to the romantic adventurer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery - When the Last Man standing first came out, it was hard not to make the connection between that film and Yojimbo (since Yojimbo's script was credited -although not the original source for Yojimbo, an American crime novel, red Harvest, by Dashiell Hammet - Yojimbo's Kurosawa also forgot to credit in his film). But even a critic as astute as Roger Ebert only thought the film was only 'similar' to "Fistful of Dollars" even though the plots of the two films have more in common than that of this film and Yojimbo.Since then, I have watched all the films several times. Now is as good a time as any to reflect on the matter again. The Last Man Standing does not hold up as well as I had hoped; the saturated sepia tones of the film now appear to be a mannerist affectation. It was certainly a transitional film for Willis - the role is pretty heavy - but the Sixth Sense rewrote the book on Willis far better than any of his other off-cast roles could, since (unlike the others) it never made any pretense at being an action film. The voice over is a little pretentious. And its clear that Hill let the Gothic tone of the film overwhelm his efforts at black comedy. And oddly enough, despite its violence the film could use more action.Yet the film remains historically important, if nothing else, because it now appears to have been the last of a cycle. Although even Jean-Claude Van Damme actually appeared in a "Yojumbo" clone - "Desert Heat" - and there have been other attempts to revive Hammett's essential narrative (e.g. the "Doom" robot film by Albert Pyun) the fact remains that the nameless outsider quick on the draw is fast slipping into the realm of pure 20th century myth. He doesn't really belong in the era of Computer graphics, invasions of Iraq, wars against non-existent terrorism. His blood is part whiskey, but it's human blood; and he may be a killer, but he won't be a party to genocide. He's too real, and yet too good, for the 21st century rushing in on us.I take the darkly sepia-toned Last Man Standing as a final farewell to a hero of the previous century, just as Hitchcock's 39 Steps effectively said farewell to the romantic adventurer of the 19th century. Every era has its heroes; and it is sad that Sanjuro/John Smith/the Man with No Name can no longer be one of ours. It's probably too much to ask, but hopefully someone better - or at least as good - will come along. -E. J. Winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable if rather dark action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie serves fine for some action, with excellently dark shoot-outs being shown as John Smith (Bruce Willis), as he has told us at least, wonders into this town and quickly learns to play the two opposing gangs for all they are worth, willing to kill in the process of course, which he does expertly while wielding two colt .45 1911's masterfully. This movie recalls both the westerns of of the sixties, one of which, For a Fistful of Dollars, is another adaptation of this movie's source material, Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, as well as the noir movies of the 40's. This may work for some but it does feel rather odd, in both a good and bad way. Bruce Willis, in grim and monotone manner, is perfect for the narration held in between the shoot-outs. This narration, along with the costume's of the characters, fedora's and all, are cheerful reminders of the noir movies of past, to show that perhaps that genre has a little life left within it. The desert setting in which this 1860's style ghost town, in which the two rival gangs square off, both with help from our main character, is located in is the main reminder then of the western part of this movie as well. The Plot then is basically Bruce Willis's character playing both sides for whatever he can get. He is grimly cool in a certain way. The gangs then are the Irish, led by Doyle, and the Italians, led by Strozzi. These gangs are essentially copies of each other except for their names and accents, and perhaps their faces. The only difference of course being that Doyle has a psychotic second-in-command, or so we are told at the start of the movie. He, as a psychotic, is played by the true mother of all psychotic playing actors.... You guessed it, Christopher Walken, essentially playing Christopher Walken. The only other occupants of the town then are the sheriff, bartender, and undertaker. In the end this is movie is certainly a dark one, although it is also not particularly serious in terms of realism. The atmosphere is extremely dark and grim as many characters are killed by Willis as well as Walken. It may actually be found depressing later on in the movie. However, contrary to this, the violence is often slightly comical. In one instance as many as forty bullets are needed to take down a character, and in others people, after having been shot by pistols, fly back several yards in the air. Something will certainly work for everyone who sees this movie, however only some will find all of these mixed aspects pleasurable when placed together as they have been here. This movie definitely employs major style, both in its shoot-outs and visual style. In parts of this film, the color has been diluted so much that it appears more or less selectively colored, such as in Sin City but not so much so. This will work for noir fans as well as those who find this bold style innovative and original, but others will find that it contributes more-so merely to the grim nature of this movie. The shoot-outs, undeniably are the best part of this movie and is all you desire is some good action then this movie fills that desire well. While this movie prefers darkness over fun, the stylistic and violent gunfights as well as the dark style will appeal to many, as it has to me. 7/10</fullReview>

There mostly guy films, with high action and lots of sexual preference. But this was a solid film all together. Willis gives a solid performace and so does Walken. The action scenes are extremely good and provide much excitment. I gave this film an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Macho, stylish but not very brainy, medium good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For Last Man Standing, director Walter Hill relocates Kurosawa's Yojimbo to depression era America in a dusty desert town. There is something arguably distinctive about the flick. Perhaps it is the merger of gangster and western; something seldom seen in movies. Or perhaps it is the way that Hill's visual portrayal of a time and place seems flawless. Last Man Standing has an exceptionally retro look to it, very crusty and dusty, and also very macho.The problem with Last Man Standing comes down to it's roots. Once you've seen Yojimbo, Last Man Standing doesn't feel all that special. Hill never chooses to break free of the Kurosawa structure, so his film is predictable from the get go. Having said that, even if you know the outcome of the trip, part of the journey is worth while. As an action film, Last Man Standing delivers in spectacular fashion. The fight scenes are staged with a sense of gusto and texture; something is often denied to the majority of such scenes in other movies.When Last Man Standing is in adrenaline mode it works, but when it comes to the talky segments, it feels painfully stiff. The acting style is flat, and everybody delivers their lines with the same sour expression, which Hill seems quite fond of considering how many facial close ups he uses.In the end, the movie has a little something to offer. It's recommendable on some grounds, but it needs a bit more brain and less brawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dusty, Stylish, Macho Detective-Samurai-Western-Gangster Hybrid Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In prohibition times, a mysterious stranger drifts into the ramshackle town of Jericho on the American-Mexican border, run by two rival gangs of bootleggers. Sniffing paydirt, he hires himself out to both factions as a gunman. Can he stay one step ahead of the hoods ?This is a stylish, hard-nosed gangster reworking of Sergio Leone's 1964 Per Un Pugno Di Dollari / A Fistful Of Dollars, which was a western remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1961 ronin classic Yojimbo (and all three stories bear a lot of similarity to Carlo Goldoni's 1753 comic play Il Servitore Di Due Padroni / The Servant Of Two Masters). It cites the Japanese film as its main source, but is essentially a remake of both; storywise it follows the samurai movie (for example, Walken's character is identical to Tatsuya Nakadai's), but visually it's much closer to Leone's (lots of guns). It's own hard-boiled style, with raspy narration and a town full of grifters, also comes from noir fiction (say, Dashiel Hammett's 1929 pot-boiler Red Harvest). In this sense, it's more of a series of cultural references and motifs than a movie, but it's still a lot of fun, remaining faithful to the classic tale of the mysterious pragmatic avenger, and the hybrid gangster/western setting is very original. Willis lacks the mythic qualities of Mifune and Eastwood, but is pretty good in the lead, with able support from Sanderson and Dern. The two best performances are by Hill regular Kelly as the head of the Irish clan (there's a beautifully tender moment where he expresses his unassailable love for Lombard whilst his goons look embarrassed) and the ever-reliable Walken as a nutty red-headed whispering psycho. This story will always be appealing because it slyly blurs the divide between hero and antihero - he helps and exploits people in equal measures. Slickly written by Hill in his usual tough-guy patois, with a strangled score by Ry Cooder, top-notch stuntwork by Allan Graf and great dusty sepia-soaked photography by Lloyd Ahern - surely this is the brownest film ever made. Well worth catching, but don't miss its two predecessors, particularly Yojimbo (the hardest to find), which is one of the most engrossing, stylishly-made and funniest mythic adventure movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They were all better off dead..." Dull period action saved somewhat by Willis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Man Standing tells the tale of a gun for hire (Bruce Willis) who is travelling through Texas to get to Mexico, about 50 miles from the Texan border he stops at a ghost town called Jericho which is run by two Irish &amp; Italian feuding Chicago bootlegging gangs. They currently have a truce but tensions are high between them, he checks things out &amp; finds the local Sheriff Ed Galt (Bruce Dern) is bent &amp; he senses he can make some easy money. First he kills a couple of men working for gang leader Doyle (David Patrick Kelly) &amp; is promptly hired by Doyle's rival gang leader Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), he calls himself 'John Smith' &amp; begins to play the two gangs off each other as he passes information along which will make him lots of money. However Smith becomes too involved &amp; as the situation spirals out of control just about everyone wants him dead...Written, produced &amp; directed by Walter Hill I thought Last Man Standing was an average &amp; fairly forgettable action/western remake of Yojimbo (1961) &amp; A Fistful of Dollars (1964). The script which takes itself very seriously is alright but it could have used more action, as it is it feels long &amp; drawn out without much happening. You know I'm not really that sure who Last Man Standing is meant to appeal to, it has elements of drama, action, romance, western &amp; thriller without actually settling down &amp; concentrating on one particular genre. It's a bit messy &amp; while it tries to be several things it ends up being nothing in particular. The film features a constant narration by Willis' character which saves the need for a lot of dull exposition heavy dialogue I suppose but it's flatly written as is the whole film really. To be fair to it it's watchable but nothing special, in fact I only saw it a few hours ago &amp; I can barely remember it. I wasn't convinced by some of the plot either, I mean why would these gangs give Willis' character so much information when basically they didn't know him? Why did they trust him so much &amp; fall for every lie hook, line &amp; sinker? The ease with which Willis play the two gangs off each other just seemed far too easy to me.Director Hill does alright but the few action scenes are very brief &amp; not exciting in the slightest, then there's the pacing problem because it does drag in places &amp; there's not much variety in the plot either. I also didn't like the decision to film everything in a brown/orange sepia tone, everything just looks dusty, dirty &amp; very dull with little detail. To be fair the period recreation is well done &amp; it looks the business but, well, I still didn't like it that much. The violence is tame with little blood, there's some nudity including Willis' bare bum if that's your thing.With a supposed budget of about $67,000,000 Last Man Standing tanked at the box-office &amp; you can understand why, I'm not really sure who it was meant to appeal to. It's well made for sure with high production values although the annoying brown tone makes things a little muddy &amp; hard to make out. The acting is OK, I really like Bruce Willis &amp; he's made some great films although why he chose to do this is beyond me, luckily he got back on track with his next film The Fifth Element (1997). The great Christopher Walken is wasted in nothing more than a cameo role while Ned Eisenberg has recovered from a homicidal maniac shoving a pair of garden shears into his throat in the classic slasher The Burning (1981).Last man Standing is an OK time waster, it's nothing special &amp; I can see why it bombed at the box-office. Worth watching if your a Bruce Willis fan but even then you may not be that impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaks no new ground, but Hill and Willis make it watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not much rattles John Smith (Bruce Willis), he has the sort of unflappable self-confidence that requires not an absolute belief in one's own abilities, but the misguided thought that one could control the uncontrollable.Random gunfire, warring crime gangs and deceitful backstabbing women are not a concern to Mr Smith. Even when it seems that all three factors are conspiring to end his existence he doesn't feel that the combined threat even warrants a facial expression. Were he wearing a heart rate monitor I am sure the testers might remove it after gun battles to see if it was turned on.So when John Smith wanders casually into Jericho, Texas in his 1920s jalopy looking for whisky and a map, only to find desolation, despair and death, he sees opportunity.The rival gangs that wrestle for control of the town are lead by an Irish guy named Doyle (David Patrick Kelly) and a slick group of Italians lead by Strozzi. The precious few other citizens of Jericho include an apathetic sheriff (Bruce Dern) - who could care less as long as the violence remains within certain parameters - various hookers, a saloon owner who runs a perpetually empty saloon and an undertaker for whom business is booming.And over the coming days it'll only get better.Smith is immediately 'noticed' upon arriving in town and when the initial intimidation tactics fail he is headhunted for a new vacancy in the Doyle gang. The Strozzi gang gets wind and decides the new gun must work for them.Smith doesn't care who he works for as long as the cheque clears, and he spends a considerable amount of time alternating between siding with - and blowing away - employees on both sides in gloriously exaggerated fashion.Take one scene for example where Smith visits a local 'working girl' and midway through 'festivities' he is thrown headlong into a gun fight with several heavily armed bad guys. After pulling two pistols - I don't want to know where from -in the span of a few seconds a buck-nekkid Smith takes down his assailants in a hail of bullets, as if this isn't the oddest thing to happen that day...As the body count piles up and tensions rise it is obvious that Smith will eventually have to either choose a side or simply take both gangs down personally. For the main part the film is generally reasonably quiet, only punctuated by dialogue so dry that the actors cough dust and insanely loud gunfire from handguns that seemingly never run out of bullets.Bruce maintains the same squint and set jaw throughout the entire film. If he divided his paypacket by lines of dialogue or facial expressions then his salary would be the highest in film history this side of Holly Hunter in The Piano, who might I remind you was mute.Christopher Walken also appears as the menacingly homicidal and universally feared Hickey, the only guy in town with a machine gun and Doyle's right hand man, and as always he takes every opportunity to chew up the scenery and in this case blow a lot of it away.The finale is both preposterous and a little confusing, but then again that is to be expected where on more than one occasion one man with two guns can take down a roomful of trained gunmen before they can even raise their own weapons.Despite the simplicity and illogical elements I liked Last Man Standing. Bruce once again played the underdog only this time with little doubt that he would emerge victorious, even though he gets the living crap kicked out of him a couple times, and the well directed action sequences are in the main bloodless and suitably gymnastic, with the recipients of some of the many bullets seemingly propelled dozens of metres backwards and flipping over an over again seconds after being shot.Special mention too to the quiet, quiet, quiet, LOUD dirty blues that serves as the score here, it was both familiar but a different approach to the usual action movie backdrop.Final Rating - 6 / 10. Bruce Willis was hardly breaking new ground when he agreed to do this, but at the same time director Walter Hill managed to make what could have easily been a formulaic action film into something at least worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, gritty noir action film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that while I have not seen Yojimbo, and only just yesterday saw A Fistful of Dollars (Last Man Standing being a remake of Yojimbo, just as Fistful is) that while Fistful is the more classic, iconic, and clever of the two, Last Man Standing still stands tall as a gritty, exciting, and beautifully atmospheric noir film. Every second of the film drips beautiful Prohibition era gangster atmosphere that, if you're into that sort of experience, will make it a thrilling film. If you loved Fistful and Yojimbo, this is probably worth seeing just to see the third and least famous take on this classic story of a nameless man working two warring groups for his own benefits. The action, when it happens, is fast furious and highly stylish, and Bruce Willis (while no Clint Eastwood) holds his own as a really convincing and enjoyable antihero as John Smith. It's tragically undervalued and overlooked, and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And like Jericho, Walls come tumbling down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ry?zô Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern.Walter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration.The look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen.It's an odd blend of a Western with Prohibition Noir characters, but it's unmistakably a Walter Hill film. For his fans there's enough to like about it whilst accepting it's a bit of a throwaway on the page. For the casual crime/action film fan, however, it's likely to be much ado about nothing. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay prohibition era gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie tells the story of a loner going to Jericho, Texas which is a border town near Mexico and gets mixed up with two rival booze gangs during prohibition. Bruce plays the main character named John Smith which is basically a way of calling him a Name with No Name like Clint Eastwood's character was in the Dollars Trilogy. Smith plays the two gangs against each other leveraging them from more money until things get out of hand and eventually he has to choose between the two.The movie has a really good cast with Bruce Dern, Leslie Mann, Christopher Walken, Michael Imperioli amongst others.The movie is basically a remake of the Kurosawa film Yojimbo and while it doesn't quite equal the heights of that it's a solid film but not great.</fullReview>

Call'em popcorn &amp; beer movies.Mr. Hill has had one hell of an amazing career. But damn. I mean, "DAMN"! This is some damn fine "movie making" . Shot like an art film. Samurai storyline, with prohibition era weaponry; 1911 .45's, Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers, Thompson Submachine guns, B.A.R's, Colt Single Actions, amazing! Booze, guns, babes, violence, GET DOWN!Flawless cast, and the Ry Cooder soundtrack, damn! This man was born to lay down the most amazing movie music. Remember Southern Comfort? Ry Cooder is a national treasure. Christopher Walken is spot-on perfect. This is edgy, violent drunken fun. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Man Standing is the story of John Smith, a gun-for-hire with an ambiguous conscience. He is on the run from his latest (unexplained) adventures when he finds himself in the small Texas town of Jericho. The town, not really much of a town, is plagued by two warring gangs. Smith sees the situation as an opportunity to make some quick cash by playing both sides against each other. However, as the story unfolds we find Smith to be caught in a conflict of his own warped sense of honor and conscience (which of course is profoundly ironic since Smith claims to be without a conscience).The movie is solid but nothing special. It is well acted, Bruce Willis as the lead character John Smith is superb and Christopher Walken is, as always, superb as the Irish mobs number one shooter. The two lead female characters in the film play a major part in the development of the story despite not having large roles.Overall Last Man Standing is a fantastic movie, but not in the sense that it's a good movie but the sense that it is quite unrealistic. Regardless it is very entertaining and a great movie to watch when you don't want to put much thought into the movie. It is a guy movie though, meaning it is rather violent (though not graphically so) and contains a fair amount of female nudity and sexual content (again not graphically so).My final recommendation is sit down with a bag of popcorn and enjoy watching Bruce Willis kick some bad guy butt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mysterious loner by the name of John Smith (Bruce Willis) decides to stay a small, dusty small town of Jericho. Which this Texas town is in a war between two gangsters in the control of bootlegging. Smith decides to be a hired gun-men for Fredo Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg) after Smith kills one of Doyle's men Finn (Patrick Kilpatrick). Which it was misunderstanding and something personal behind Smith &amp; Finn. Which Smith decides to join Strozzi for money and also killing more men from Doyle. Smith starts to make a mistake, when he finally meets Doyle (David Patrick Kelly) and he offers Smith more money to be on his side. Which Smith doesn't care which side he works for, beside who has the better deal. But Smith starts to care for a half native girl Felina (Karina Lombard), which she wants to be freed from Doyle. When he decides to help her to be freed, Doyle's men nearly beats Smith to death. Now Smith makes a personal vendetta against Doyle and his men.Directed by Walter Hill (48 Hrs, Trespass, The Warriors) made an entertaining action/drama with action and an sense of humour. Director Hill handle the gun play extremely well with style and flair. Willis plays his character well and he gives an good performance. Oscar-Winner:Christopher Walken plays a hired gun-men for Doyle and he delivers some classic dialogue in this movie. Bruce Dern has an good supporting role as The Sheriff that looks the other way and William Sanderson is also fine the loyal bartender/friend to Smith. This film was an major Box Office disappointing back in 1996, which it was one of the biggest flops for New Line Cinema and still is.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan &amp; Scan) and an terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's only extras are the original theatrical trailer and cast &amp; crew information. This movie was critically panned back in 1996, most critics hated it. So did i back then but now, i decided to give it another chance. I enjoyed it even more now than back then, when i first seen it in Video back in 1997. This film has good production designs, excellent Widescreen cinematography by Lloyd Ahern the Second and dynamic music score by Ry Cooder (The End of Violence, Johnny Handsome, Primary Colors). The film has a loyal cult following, especially those who followed Hill's work. This is a remake of a Japanese picture "Yojimbo", which it was written by Akira Kurosawa (The Hidden Fortress, Ran, The Seven Samurai) and Ryuzo Kikushima (Runaway Train, Tora! Tora! Tora!). Which Kurosawa directed the original as well. Hill wrote the screenplay of this underrated movie. Plenty of familiar faces appears in small parts. Michael Imperioli from "The Sopranos" fame has a small role as a gangster. Leslie Mann appears in a bit part. Super 35. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willis whispers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LMS is an unusual combination of western and gangster film. It's pretty much a stylish fantasy action film, which some people didn't seem to understand. Most of the criticism seems to be directed at how precise Willis shoots and that he's apparently immune to bullets. But LMS isn't exactly meant to be nitpicked over as if it were some semi-documentary or biopic. Very early on the tone of the film is established, making the viewer understand that LMS is more to be enjoyed almost as a simple shoot-'em-up computer game. Of course, one needs to be a somewhat intelligent viewer or at least someone who has experience watching movies to grasp this simple fact. (I love people who review, for example, thrillers without having seen more than 10 of them altogether.) Yes, Willis is an anti-magnet for bullets while his own bullets seem to have divine power. So what. One person even objected that Willis "squints like Eastwood". First of all, Eastwood is not the first man to squint, either on celluloid or in reality, i.e. he doesn't have exclusive copyright on squinting. Secondly, how else is Willis meant to play this character? As a wide-eyed gay ballerina? Should he sing and dance perhaps? Flirt with Walken?This movie is fun from beginning to end. Sure the plot is unbelievable, but this is a fantasy not a "character study", and the story is at least interesting, which is more than I can say for so many overrated, critically acclaimed movies. It is of course absurd that Willis could possibly survive in the end; realistically, he should have been knocked off in the first 20 minutes. But shouldn't James Bond have died early on in "Dr.No", too?The action scenes are dynamic, and even though it is almost implied that Willis is invulnerable, they are far from dull. After all, in how many westerns - "acclaimed" westerns - do Eastwood and others also play gun-totting shooters who are almost invincible? I do think, however, that Willis overdid it with his "cool whisperings". Often his voice was barely audible. I don't see how any other characters could have understood him unless he was literally speaking into their ear-lobes. There is even a duel of the whisperers, which occurs when Walken and Willis meet for the first time. However, Alec Baldwin's "cool whisperings" are much worse - and very annoying.Another plus is the cast. No effeminate girls like Di Crapio or Damon to spoil this. Walken and Dern steal the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rodriguez style gangster-western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Didn't quite know what to expect when I picked this one up at the store for $5. Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken in a Western set in 1930's prohibition? (you may think that is a gangster film, but trust me, watching this, it's not.) Anyways, I was forced to ask myself the question "if this film's so good why's it being sold so cheap?" Well I'm not one to shun a film just cus it's got a low low price, hell I picked up Street Fighter (the original Chiba one) for just a dollar. So I figured I might as well check it out see if it's really worth it.Well it was. I'm not too familiar with Walter Hill, but he does a fine job in this film showing Bruce Willis blasting away at the bad guys. Watching it I'm reminded of a watered down Desperado. This whole film seems like a Robert Rodriguez film without the Robert Rodriguez attitude. And while that is missed, especially in the screenplay, it's still got some wonderful shootouts in it.Based off the same story Sergio Leone's Fistfull of Dollars takes it's plot from, you'll notice many similarities between the two. In fact, you could even see this as a re-make of Fistfull of Dollars if you wanted to, but not in a bad way. To give a fair analogy, this movie is to Fistfull of Dollars as the Tom Savini 1990 re-make of Night of the Living Dead is to the original 68 George Romero film. Same basic plot, slightly different action, which one's better? Well you decide.You want to see something fun, shot well, something that successfully mixes the two sub-genres of western and gangster films, something that's got Bruce Willis going Desperado on Christopher Walken? Pick this one up and have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Man Standing is a film that just isn't liked very much, and I can definitely see why. It's a very dry and lonely piece. The main character isn't very sympathetic and is just as cold and merciless as everybody in the ghost town of Jericho.The only difference is while everybody's taken sides, he's playing both of them and although it's just a blatant retelling of Akira Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" (1961) and "A Fistful of Dollars" (1967) it definitely has its moments.Bruce Wills plays John Smith, a hired gun on the dodge from what, nobody knows but when he stumbles across the border-town of Jericho and finds two rival gangs on brink of war, the opportunity is too good to resist and he's not the type of guy to pass up some fast-bucks cause if you ask him - "They were all better off dead".Directed by Walter Hill, Last Man Standing is tough as nails and if you're in the mood to see some no-holds-barred killing and gun play then by all means watch, but if it's meaning you're looking for then steer clear because this one definitely won't change your life.</fullReview>

Helping out the girl, got beat up and helped by the bartender. The undertaker, burning of one of the gangster's house etc. Set took place at an old cowboy town, just fast forward a few years from Fistfull of Dollars. Or fast backward a few years and you have the same set as "Fistfull of Dollars". The only disappointment is the ending. I sure thought there should be more fight between Walkins character since during the movie, there is build up on how bad this guys is. A single shoot ended his life seem a bit too fast. He really did not show how bad he really is. Worth seeing. The DTS soundtrack is great.</fullReview>

It's basically the same storyline set in a different era, right down to the people jumping out of the burning building towards the end. The end of the film sees Bruce Willis' character holing up in an abandoned church just like Eastwood's character hiding out in that old mine at the end of Fistful of Dollars. That said, it was an alright movie to watch. I would've rated this movie higher, but I can't give it extra points for originality because the story's been borrowed from an old classic film.</fullReview>

I don't know how true that is, but if you watch a lot of movies, you will come to believe it.I generally hate it when they remake great Japanese movies, but since Akira Kurosawa (Rashômon, The Seven Samurai) stole Yojimbo from Dashiell Hammett, I guess fair is fair. Anyway, Sergio Leone also stole the story and made a western version - Per un pugno di dollari - with Clint Eastwood. Now, Bruce Willis is no Clint Eastwood, but I generally find his films to be a pleasant way to spend my time - I watched Hostage for the fourth or fifth time last night.He does a reliably good job as a gangster in this film and is supported by a truly evil bad guy, Christopher Walken. There are some other great performers in this "guy" film. Yes, there are women, but they have really minor roles.Ry Cooder provides some great blues that really sets the tone.</fullReview>

The slaughter of one gang by the other and finally his killing off the remaining gang. What's really different? It's still an enjoyable movie.

		<shortDescription>A fine film, with excellent performances and well-crafted violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film - cast in sepia-type tones - makes a powerful statement about violence and its corrosive effect on society. The war between the Irish and Italian gangs in the ominously named town of Jericho has driven out virtually all the original residents. The gangsters all dress in uniform - three-piece suits, and behave as brutally as possible. Into this cauldron of crime, guns, and greed steps Bruce Willis as the wonderfully named John Smith - the man with no name. Impressed as I have always been with the stopping power of the Colt .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol, Smith finds miraculous ways to make the clips hold more bullets (I thought they originally held 7 bullets, with one extra in the chamber) than I can count. But does he use those weapons to good effect! Every scummy gangster gets what he deserves - they all deserved killing. Truly an epiphany of violence. The scenes in Mexico make you feel the grit, dirt and sweat, as the corrupt soldiers get machine-gunned.Bruce Dern puts in a great turn as a completely corrupt sheriff, paid off by both sides. But he has a saving grace - he recognizes John Smith's one weakness, and then discovers another, his loyalty to those who have helped him. When questioned by Dern what he can possibly do with a butcher knife against Doyle's mob, he replies he can get a gun with it. Great. Then Dern gives him two 45s and leaves town.The end is a wonderful tornado of violence - all the gangsters get sent to Boot Hill and Willis shoots down Walken, who puts in his trademark excellent performance as a psychotic murderer who burned down as orphanage as a child.The interplay between Willis and Walken is truly riveting.A fine film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Man standing is simply amazing, I didn't think much of the DVD case at my mate's house since the spine and front cover looked like an action man film, since it was bright orange. But right from the start when John Smith pulls up in what seemed like a deserted town called Jericho, but we soon see Doyle's gang smashing his car, but little did Doyle's gang know John Smith is overwhelmingly lethal with his two guns. The film then carries on with Smith getting familiar with the way things work around Jericho, he learns that the town is run by two opposing gangs in an effort to rule Jericho. Smith then plays an incredibly smart game when he pretends to work for one gang, but then switches sides to work for the other gang. Smith then finds out that the only way of surviving is to be independent, and he smartly fools both gangs by the brilliant climax. This film has a really effective atmosphere that makes us feel the strong tension, with an old western feel. Simply put Bruce Willis heads a great cast into producing a classic film, it's a must see for anyone who really appreciates gangster films, and yet again tremendous acting from especially Bruce Willis!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If guys are voting lower than 6 on this, they don't know movies and they don't know history. If you're a woman, and voting less than 4, you need to stick with your animated Disney collection.The movie had a well researched plot and storyline. The character development was very good that it did not spoil the introduction of a person beforehand. The power of certain guns and the speed of quick-draw were well checked and rehearsed through for accuracy. Some may believe that an old ghost town would show people in drab or something similar to an old farm during the depression. Not so in true stories related from the southwest in the early 1920's. The movie writers understood that the gangs' roots and respect went back to their Chicago roots and they were the intermediary for moving alcohol in the states from the south. It showed how corruption in backwater towns worked when a gang is 2/3 of that town's population. Throwing in a good cast helped move the development along and has crowds rooting for the bad guy for hire.The Movie begins with a eastern gunslinger who's kind of jogging from his past and cross the Mexican border. Along the way he doesn't mind stopping to pick up a few bucks her and there as a hired gun. He runs into a small town run by two Chicago gangs. He learns the town is keeping up only because the bootleggers' are the medium between the northeast bars and the Mexican alcohol suppliers. The final battle evolves when an American border patrol officer is killed and a marshal tells the gunfighter that one or both gangs need to leave town before the marshal returns with reinforcements. This is truly a movie to watch a couple of times on the BIG SCREEN if you have connections with a small town movie theater. Definitely a treasured collection to a great action movie collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Walter Hill Film, haven't seen much by him lately, but a superior casting for the main character, Walter 'Bruce' Willis!!! What an action hero! Bruce always exudes a tremendous level of in control natural cool until, it's time to get nuts!! The man in between is what John Smith is (Willis) he is smart enough to play both sides and come out from between the waring factions on top. That's just his style. He has a snide and cutting wit, he preserves his angst until he is in the battle, then it becomes 'Watch-out' to everyone else around him. What a crew, that Last Man Standing contained. Christopher Walken, there's a flavor that saturates the stories's palate. Mr. cold and sly-delivery, he has a way about him that you just can't deny, even when he is a bad guy, you love it! Ned Eisenberg (Miami Vice /Various other roles) is a condescending and sometimes scared, but pleasing character, he brings a good addition to the cast that rounds out this bad guy verses good-man action film. Bruce Dern, is a great good guy and a superb bad guy. His evil radar is up and he is keyed to what's going on around him almost like satellite coverage. Willis brings on a major slice of energy and grit to cover anyone who doesn't possess it. The Last Man Standing isn't a western, but it has a feel good sort of western appeal of when John Wayne rode along only just a bit more brutal and cutting edged! (*****) Recommended largely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Man Standing so desperately wants to be a western, but can't bring itself to follow all the way through. The second remake of the Japanese film Yojimbo from legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, which was initially remade as A Fistful of Dollars starring Clint Eastwood, Last Man Standing is set in a dusty, windswept Texas city right out of a Hollywood western, yet the characters are all dressed in attire from the 1920's and carry tommy guns. It's is an unusual visual dichotomy that proves to be about the most engaging thing in Last Man Standing, a film that seems to be almost pointless, lacking any real reason to exist other than to watch characters blow other characters away.John Smith (Bruce Willis) is a loner making his way through the Texas desert and stops off at the city of Jericho. Jericho is controlled by two mobster gangs, one Italian, one Irish. The two are using Jericho to funnel illegal booze from the Mexican border during prohibition. The town is more or less uninhabited, save for the gang members, the saloon keeper (Tracey Walter) and the undertaker (The saloon keeper says in one scene "Business isn't too good these days." So . . . why are you staying in this city?). John Smith finds himself stranded in the city when he looks at the Irish mobster boss' woman in bondage, Felina (Karina Lombard) and the Irish mobsters politely inform him that he shouldn't be doing that and promptly render his car unusable (He better not take her back to Chicago, they will have to wreck a lot of cars).John quickly decides he can use this situation to his advantage to make money and presents himself to the Italian boss, Fredo Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), who likes Smith, but his cousin Giorgio (Michael Imperioli, before he switched families and joined The Sopranos) doesn't trust him. Eventually, Smith manages to take a similar tack with Irish boss Doyle (David Patrick Kelley), but Smith's motives are questioned by Doyle's right hand man, the sadistic Hickey (Christopher Walken) (Apparently, henchmen don't like being muscled out by other henchmen). This all eventually leads to a whole lot of death and carnage, not to mention bad feelings on both sides.Director Walter Hill has been in a Western mode for several years, having made Geronimo, Wild Bill, the pilot for HBO's Deadwood and an upcoming AMC miniseries set in the old west, and it's obvious that he is applying that same motif where he can in Last Man Standing. But since A Fistful of Dollars had already made Yojimbo into a straight western (and Yojimbo itself was an homage to American western films), Hill has to settle for an "almost" western. Aside from the look of the film, what the audience is treated to in Last Man Standing is a lot of posturing, a lot of gunplay and not much else. Hill seems to like these kinds of movies where tough guys act tough, and you don't get much tougher than blowing people away at the drop of a hat.Aside from it's violence, Last Man Standing doesn't really offer anything to the viewer. There isn't any romance (as with most other Hill films, Last Man Standing is not exactly female friendly), although Smith does show his softer side on occasion, there isn't any intrigue, and even though effectively played by Willis, Smith fails to be a very compelling character to put any stock in. Aside from Willis, Imperioli and Kelley overact a bit too much, Eisenberg is okay, and Walken manages to make Hickey a despicable character, but since Smith isn't exactly our idea of a hero, can we really work up an dislike for Hickey (It doesn't help that he is "movie insane", shooting wildly at walls and throwing things around with abandon. Who really does this?).So, Last Man Standing, while attractively photographed and with a nice, solid performance by Willis, is still a big "So?" Not how I envision spending two hours of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest film, yet one I thoroughly enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time i saw this movie I was about 9 or 10, and I absolutely loved it. But then I saw A Fistful of Dollars starring Clint Eastwood and thought that Last Man Standing was just a blatant ripoff of it, but then I learned that A Fistful of Dollars is actually inspired by a film called Yojimbo which is a Japanese samurai film which is based on a book called The Red Harvest. Which means that Last Man Standing yet another version of Yojimbo. Although it is more similar to A Fistful of Dollars I'm sure.A few minor complaints with LMS is that the film-noir style is supposed to be telling the story as it goes, but I found most of the narrating to be saying the obvious with cheesy lines. A minor complaint that I have, which is all too common among action films is that the guns seem to have 100 bullets, and never have to reload until everybody is dead, or when somebody is shot by a pistol they get sent flying back 10 feet.Other than the over the top action and a few bland narrative lines, this film is worth a watch especially if you're a Bruce Willis fan. Walter Hill isn't a fantastic director in my opinion, but he can film a good action sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mean and dusty movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You get the feeling that somewhere underneath all that dust there was a good movie waiting to be made. This Walter Hill film is really nothing too exceptional, though. How in the world could any movie in which Bruce Willis fires so many rounds of ammunition lose 49 million dollars? The film uses the ancient story of a mysterious drifter waltzing into town and pitting himself between two rival gangs. This plot has been used in westerns, samurai films, you name it. This film takes place in a dusty west Texas town which seems to exist only for the purpose of being a midway point for bootlegging during Prohibition. Two gangs have an uneasy truce going when Willis drives into town and starts wreaking havoc. One gang is led by David Patrick Kelly, who is an old Walter Hill stand-by actor. The other is led by Ned Eisenberg. You may remember him as being the guy from Moving Violations who is really into horror films. Both gangs are incompetent, but at least Kelly has the services of Christopher Walken's savage character on his side. Willis predictably routes these gangs, or sets up scenarios where they can kill off each other.The biggest problem with this film is its tone. Everyone is mean, depressed, or indifferent. Nobody is having any fun at all. Walter Hill is such a talented man. Hadn't he seen Willis in The Last Boy Scout? That film was also loaded with excessive violence, but it was at least FUN! Hill has given us 48 Hours and the Warriors. Those films also worked mainly because they didn't take themselves too seriously. Last Man Standing is all style and no grace.The action of this film is also very easy to see coming. Does it take a genius to figure out that when the Mexican woman gives her necklace to Willis that it will be found on him later by Kelly's gang? Notice how they beat him senseless, then turn their backs long enough for him to crawl away! You have got to be kidding me! There is not one surprise along the way.The location is dirty and desolate, but I found it somewhat beautiful. The music from Ry Cooder (whom Hill often uses) is very good and atmospheric. These little things make you wonder what a re-write could have done for the film.I'll give it 5 of 10 stars. The Hound just hates to see a good director waste a good cast!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best action, western and gangster movies I've ever seen. Willis was perfect for the part of John Smith (his voice-over has some of the best dialogue ever and if you don't believe me check out the opening scene), a gun for hire without a conscience. All elements of each genre are highly spoken for.The editing, dialogue, cinematography, music, direction and acting are all top class. Everything is fantastically overblown but never preposterous.As for the film itself, it is very empty but the mood and tone are so very distant and weird, and I totally love it. Walter Hills direction is a well balanced cross between Sam Peckinpah and John Woo. And Cooder's score will transport you right into the movie even on it's own. This wall always be one of my fave movies and it is very much worthy of 5 stars.The 2.50:1 anamorphic picture is stunning and there are rumors that Hill originally wanted to make it in B/W but New Line Cinema would not let him. To test this out turn your color right down and see how much the film's atmosphere is enhanced from already gloomy to undeniably depressing, BUT IT IS SO COOL.The DD 5.1 sound quality on this DVD during the gunfights is absolutely amazing. It will bug the hell out of your neighbors, but who cares? Every now and again Walter Hill injects a sudden burst of ferocious, furious and brutal violence that takes your breath away. When people are killed they don't just fall down, they FLY across the room and thru windows.Extras are brief and not very good (Cast Bios say that Die Hard 4 was released in 1998!) and there is a cool clip of Loaded Weapon 1 hidden in there too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa on Kurosawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Students of film have great fun with situations like this. Here we have three films (`Yojimbo,' `Fistful,' and `Last Man') with the same script but entirely different cinematic philosophies. All do well at what they attempt.Kurosawa is one of the great innovators of film, developing the notion of the disembodied eye whose curiosity changes depending on the action. He is interested not so much in the images, but in the seeing of the images and the acknowledged reaction to what is seen.Leone had a different agenda. He wanted to take an extremely mature idiom and turn some elements of it inside out. The hero is damaged goods. The focus is on the characters but the trick is to take Kurosawa's knowing eye and give it humor. So we not only are seeing Leone make fun of the Cowboy hero, he also builds in our humorous reaction into the fabric of the film. It worked and defined a style of self-ironic films that is far more popular now than ever was the western.Now comes Walter Hill. He takes the `old' selfirony away from the camera and gives it to Willis, who has made an entire career out of winking at the audience. Where the character irony used to be, Hill places cinematic irony. In other words, Leone was modifying the expectations of character and Hill modifies the expectations of situation.The result is a camera that makes fun of the pictures it takes. When Willis shoots the first guy, he barrels back a good 100 feet. When the guns go off, they are more a commentary on the silliness of guns than a serious depiction of death. Victims instantly die. All of them and us are `shot.'This only works when everything is far more abstract than in the predecessor films. The town is as desolate and simple as possible. The sunsets are only of one kind, imagined. The clothes are extremely theatrical.This film is not about a guy. It is about film, and filmmaking, using much the same trick as in `Romeo + Juliet' of that same year. Unfortunately for us. Hill is a better theorist than he is an artist. So though one can see that he set out to do something clever, even important, his skills weren't up to it. If you want to see a more successful attempt, still flawed, check out `Way of the Gun.'Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I saw this in the cinema several years ago when it first came out, I feel compelled to add my comments now, because this is the undisputed worst film I have ever seen.It has a legendary status among people I know, because a row of eight of us who went to see it were all asleep at one point.I never thought someone could make a 'blockbuster' with a big name star that still managed to be brain-numbingly boring, but Last Man Standing achieves it with ease.Instantly forgettable characters, a one dimensional linear and at times non existant plot, and absolutely nothing redeeming to keep the viewer interested in where the film's going.If I wasn't so comfortable in the cinema chair drifting into a semi-sleep, this would have been one film I would have had no qualms about walking out of very early on. Perhaps it's sleep inducing properties are referred to in its title.Message to the writer and director. If Bruce Willis has such ridiculously perfect aim and gun control, even when in the throes of making love, it gets a bit boring. There's no excitement in it.If Bruce Willis had just lined the whole cast up before the opening titles and shot the lot of them it would have saved a bit of time and wouldn't really have missed much from the plot.I've never seen the trailer to this film, but even that would be too long to be worth watching.The worst thing about it? Unlike other shockingly bad films like Spawn, Bone Collector and Hollow Man, it doesn't even afford the viewer the chance to laugh at how bad the film, the dialogue, the acting and the plot are, because it's just too boring for words.One out of ten, and that's being generous!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Smith´s Relatively Erratic Movie Review #1: Last Man Standingby you -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------LAST MAN STANDING As you read my username, you might thought LMS is my favourite movie. Well, in fact, I just think John Smith (Bruce Willis) is just the guy which I can most identify with. The music is perfect and fitting (like in all Walter Hill movies) and I think they got the combination of a western with a samurai-like athmosphere almost perfect, and together with a touch of that gangsterish prohibition style, that makes a really good action movie. The story isn´t, well, a really brilliant cocktail of twists, but it´s also not as forseeable as the average Steven Seagal movie. To me, it´s really the dialogues who make it a highly entertaining thing... The cinematography is overall average but not worth specially mentioning. In the end, I give Last Man Standing a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The grumbling narration ruined it for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the story's nothing new, this different action outing gets by on looks alone. Shot in sepia, the film brings a dead-end western town to life - along with all of the reptilian crooks and criminals who live in it. Walter Hill perhaps manages too well in recreating his lifeless town, as the whole film is weighted down by an oppressive atmosphere of boredom and depression. Or maybe that's just me? Bruce Willis stars as the down-at-heel hero, playing pretty much his usual early '90s world-weary turn. This is until the film takes a darker turn towards the finale, which sees our hero taking a brutal beating that leaves him half-dead, with only one eye. Thankfully, he's still fit enough to see off the rest of the remaining baddies with his guns that are seemingly filled with never-ending bullets. Willis is supported by a familiar cast, including Bruce Dern as the local Sheriff, William Sanderson as a bartender, and the hissable Christopher Walken as villainous henchman 'Hickey'.So anyway, this is a bleak, pessimistic film which constantly looks like it's about to burst into violent action - that is until Willis' soul-sapping narration pops up once more to drain your life away. The grumbled narration is certainly one thing I could have done without. Thankfully to make up for this miscalculation, we have some kinetic action scenes shot with a fluid energy and about a million bullets - all very impressive. In the end, though, LAST MAN STANDING is simply a passable thriller, that offers up nothing new to this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remembered the title of this film because of the leading actor, but also because critics gave it the lowest review, one star out of five, I also found out it was a remake of Yojimbo which I watched not long before, had to see what I'd think, directed by Walter Hill (The Long Riders, 48 Hrs., Brewster's Millions, Red Heat, Bullet to the Head). Basically set in the 1930s in Prohibition-era Texas, aimless drifter John Smith (Bruce Willis) is an amoral gunslinger, escaping his latest (unspecified) exploits, he turns up in the town of Jericho, Texas. Actually Jericho is not so much a town, it has become more like a ghost town, because of two warring gangs, one Italian mafia led by Fredo Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg) and one Irish mafia led by Mr. Doyle (Commando's David Patrick Kelly), have driven away "decent folk". Smith sees this rivalry as an opportunity to take advantage and make some money, playing both sides against each other, and working as a hired gun for both, current Sheriff, Ed Galt (Bruce Dern), also seems to be exploiting the conflict for personal gain. Smith may be not be afraid to display his mercenary intentions, but he does risk his own life in the process of what he is doing, the one to fear above all seems to be Doyle's right-hand man Hickey (Christopher Walken) who has no problem killing whoever gets in his way. In the end, Smith's actions are discovered by one or both sides, he gets a severe beating, but he survives it, gets revenge and kills everyone who deserve what's coming, he consoles that both gangs are better off dead, and he drives off into the distance. Also starring Alexandra Powers as Lucy Kolinski, William Sanderson as Joe Monday, Karina Lombard as Felina, Michael Imperioli as Giorgio Carmonte, R.D. Call as Jack McCool, Leslie Mann as Wanda, Tiny Ron as Jacko the Giant and Insidious's Lin Shaye as The Madame. Willis is okay as the tough mobster hard man who turns up in a dodgy town full of lowlifes, Walken does do well as the sinister henchman, I was much more engaged by the amount of bloody violence and shotguns and machine guns blazing, apart from that I can see reasons why critics give it a low review, it is pretty predictable, full of clichés, and at times slow and boring, overall it's a disappointing action thriller.

		<shortDescription>Two-gun Bruce Willis cleans up Jericho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last Man Standing" (1996) is an action movie whose main action sequences are shootings; and these are mainly Bruce Willis rapidly emptying two guns at his victims. The momentum is such that in one case the dead man is blown through a doorway out into the dusty street. The story is "Yojimbo" reworked, which originated from "Red Harvest" and subsequently found its way into "A Fistful of Dollars". Despite its familiar outlines, this one has plenty of novelty and holds one's interest. Willis's gun skills and courage are such that he manages to insinuate himself into being hired by two bootlegger gangs that are odds with one another. It makes little sense that they are operating in a remote dusty town named Jericho, accessed by a one-lane dirt road; but that's the setting. The whole thing is violent fantasy with no real takeaway themes. Willis is excellent in the role of the superior gunslinger. He provides the periodic narration. He manipulates the flows of information to the gangs. Christopher Walken registers somewhat as a tommy-gun addict in one gang, but otherwise the movie's main weakness, which is a significant one, is that the other gang members, especially their heads, just do not make an impression. The other supporting players, like Bruce Dern, Joe Sanderson and Karina Lombard are the ones who lift the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Man Standing (1996): Dir: Walter Hill / Cast: Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Bruce Dern, Alexandra Powers, William Sanderson: Mindless exercise in violence and mayhem. Title seems to indicate that everyone thinks with their fists. Bruce Willis arrives in a western town and notices a woman then he encounters a group of hoodlums who state that she is their boss's woman and underline the threat by bashing a window in his car. In response Willis shoots a dozen of them or so. This catches on and soon his services are up for auction. Two gangs run the town and Willis is paid off by both. The results are predictable, repetitious and dull. Director Walter Hill succeeds in painting the western atmosphere but he also creates one of the worst films of the year. Hill is a celebrated filmmaker whose weird and wacky The Warriors has strangely gained cult status. Willis delivers one of his worst performances as this gun slinging moron. Christopher Walken is wasted as a villain whom Willis is suppose to fear. Their showdown lacks the dramatic payoff and suspense generally associated with it. Bruce Dern, William Sanderson and Alexandra Powers are wasted in roles that are beneath them. This is a pathetic piece of trash and an insult to the western genre. It leaves one to wonder which member of the audience will be the last man waking. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of director Hills' best, but entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great action director Walter Hill creates another effective male milieu in this stylish American reworking of the story previously told in "Yojimbo" and "A Fistful of Dollars". The film certainly *looks* good, even if it's somewhat limited in its use of colour, and Ry Cooders' music score is typically flavourful and evocative. A low key Bruce Willis leads a dynamic cast of well chosen character actors. Hills' script, which he based on the screenplay for "Yojimbo" written by Akira Kurosawa and Ryuzo Kikushima, is passable; the story here yields adequate entertainment without being particularly memorable.This version is set in a small, small Texas town during the Prohibition era. Willis plays the role of "John Smith", a drifter who arrives in town to discover that there are two warring crime families dominating things. The Italian family is headed by Fredo Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), the Irish one by Doyle (David Patrick Kelly). Seemingly a man without scruples, Smith figures that he will play both sides of the street in the name of self-interest. Not surprisingly, he finds his way of life ultimately compromised.Willis is okay, but the people in supporting parts fare better. Christopher Walken has fun as a henchman with a pronounced raspy voice. Alexandra Powers does what she can with the most substantial female role in the picture, while Karina Lombard mostly just looks beautiful; Leslie Mann is fine in her brief time on screen. William Sanderson is endearing as bar owner Joe Monday; also appearing are Michael Imperioli, Ken Jenkins, R.D. Call, Ted Markland, Patrick Kilpatrick, Luis Contreras, Raynor Scheine, Tiny Ron, and Lin Shaye."Last Man Standing" is appreciably violent, if not that bloody. However, there's so much gunfire throughout the film that it all becomes a bit numbing. Also, Smith is able to blow so many damn bad guys to kingdom come that it actually comes as something of a relief when he takes his lumps at one point and we see he's human after all. The highlight for this viewer came at a little before the 80 minute mark when the intensity of the action reaches a peak.Fans of the action genre will likely have a pretty good time with this one.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Explosive And Underrated Action-Thriller. Walter Hill And Bruce Willis At Their Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Man Standing is an excellent,explosive and underrated Action-thriller that combines wonderful direction,a fantastic cast,intense Action and a memorable score. All of those elements make Last Man Standing a great Action-Thriller that is Walter Hill and Bruce Willis at their best.Set during the prohibition-era in the 1920s,Last Man Standing tells the story of John Smith(Bruce Willis),a mysterious gunslinger who arrives in the deserted town of Jericho,Texas and gets caught in the middle of an war between Irish and Italian bootlegging gangs from Chicago who are fighting over the control of illegal alcohol. Smith decides to get some money by manipulating both sides and things are going well until things become more out of control leading to violent results.Released in 1996,Last Man Standing is a wonderful and memorable Action-Thriller that was the first and only collaboration between director Walter Hill and actor Bruce Willis. Despite the pairing of Hill and Willis Last Man Standing was a Box Office flop and was panned by movie critics which I think is unfortunate because I think Last Man Standing is one of the better Action movies of the 1990s. Last Man Standing is pure entertainment from start to finish with Walter Hill mixing elements and influences of classic films such as Akira Kurosawa's Yujimbo,Sergio Leone's A Fistful Of Dollars,Dashiell Hammett's novels Red Harvest and The Glass Key while mixing together different film genres such as Action,Gangster movie,Film Noir and the Western film(in a 1920s setting)giving viewers a solid film that for 101 minutes is very over the top and a prime example of Pulp storytelling where everything from the characters,Action or dialog everything is pushed to the limit with tons of thrills and excitement but at the same time the film is intense and brutal. Many critics that panned Last Man Standing accused the film of being depressing and bleak but I think the tone of Last Man Standing is perfect for this movie because while the film is an Action movie the film's atmosphere and tone is in the spirit of Film Noir where the characters and things that happen in the film are dark and cynical and when a film deals with Gangsters,violence and crime nothing is taken lightly and that is one of the things I like about the movie. The photography by Lloyd Ahern is stylish and beautiful using the orange color to great effect and giving the film a haunting and atmospheric look that goes with the dust,dirt and sunlight that's in the film. The character John Smith is great character who is an antihero in the truest sense of the word because Smith is a person with good and bad qualities but still has a code of honor that is true to his nature. Also,Smith is a man of few words and doesn't talk instead his let's his guns the 45 Automatics do the talking for him cause as the old saying goes Actions speak louder than words. And in the classic tradition of Walter Hill's films there is no back story with the character or revealing information because we as the viewer are told about who John Smith is by his Actions in the film that makes John Smith not only morally ambiguous but also leaves viewers with questions about who he is and what his motivations are. The Action scenes in Last Man Standing are fantastic,over the top and right next to The Long Riders,Southern Comfort and Extreme Prejudice some of the most violent Action scenes Walter Hill has ever done because there is a lot of gunfights,bullets and a huge body count that gets higher and higher as you watch the film. The ending of Last Man Standing(the final 15-20 minutes)is amazing and filled with slam bang Action and is a fitting conclusion to the movie. A great ending.The cast is wonderful. Bruce Willis is excellent and at his best as John Smith,with Willis bringing a tough,quiet and cool demeanor to the role. Christopher Walken is brilliant and intense as Hickey,a man with a hoarse voice and is dangerous with the Tommy Gun. Bruce Dern is terrific as Sheriff Ed Galt,a corrupt lawman. William Sanderson is dazzling as Joe Monday,a local bartender. David Patrick Kelly is delightful and over the top as Doyle,a crime boss. Karina Lombard is beautiful and memorable as Felina,a woman held captive by Doyle. Ned Eisenberg is outstanding as Strozzi,a rival of Doyle's. Alexandra Powers is sensational as Lucy,Strozzi's mistress. Michael Imperioli does a wonderful job as Giorgio,Strozzi's cousin and right hand man. R.D Call is memorable as McCool,one of Doyle's men. Ken Jenkins does a fine job as Captain Tom Pickett,another lawman. Ted Markland(Deputy Bob),Lesile Mann(Wanda),Patrick Kilpatrick(Finn)and Luis Contreras(Commandante Ramirez)give good performances as well.The direction by Walter is outstanding and stylish,with Hill bringing a gritty and atmospheric look to the film with great angles while doing an amazing job with the Action scenes. Incredible direction,Hill.The score by Ry Cooder is great,intense and matches the tone and feel of the movie. Fine score,Cooder.In final word,if you love Walter Hill,Bruce Willis,Action Movies or Gangster Films I highly suggest you see Last Man Standing,an excellent,underrated Action-Thriller that is Walter Hill and Bruce Willis at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome! All out action from the team of Bruce Willis and Walter Hill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Man Standing is by far my favorite action movie starring Bruce Willis. A reboot of Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars written and directed by Walter Hill. Set in the prohibition period in a small town in Texas, Jericho. The town is occupied by two gangs, one Irish, the other Italian. Bruce Willis is a stranger that is traveling through town and is quite skilled with the use of firearms. He figures he can make a lot of money by working for both gangs. Known as John Smith, Bruce Willis says little and throughout the course of the film ends up depopulating the town of Jericho. Last Man Standing has much great action and is somewhat a hybrid between the western, mob movies and Hong Kong style heroic bloodshed films made popular by director John Woo. The action is very much in that style, but it is well done and intense. Combining these styles works real well in this film and director Walter Hill pulls it off without a problem. David Patrick Kelly gives one of his best performances as the Irish mob leader Doyle. Christopher Walken is Hickey, his right hand man, killer and all around violent psychopath. Plus great support from Bruce Dern as the sheriff and William Sanderson as bartender. Bruce Willis is perfect as antihero Smith and comes at ya with both guns blazing! Last Man Standing is by far one of the best action movies to come out in the mid 90's and if you want action Last Man Standing is hard to beat.</fullReview>

But watching it again last night, I was left wondering exactly why I fell for it so badly. It might not be the most original picture out there and it certainly isn't what you'd call uplifting. But there is a strange, almost cartoon-y level of carnage that action fans will lap up. A pity then, that the film is about as deep as your average burst of Tom &amp; Jerry.Bruce Willis plays a drifter who goes by the name of John Smith who winds up in the dead-end ghost town of Jericho, Texas. Quickly discovering that the town is the site of a vicious dispute between two gangs of bootleggers, Smith senses an opportunity to make a quick buck by playing the gangs off against each other. After working with the Italians led by Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg) and then the Irish families led by Doyle (David Patrick Kelly), Smith's plan quickly unravels when Doyle's psychotic right-hand man Hickey (Christopher Walken) reappears in town and takes exception to Smith's quickly-earned reputation as the ultimate gun-for-hire...Shot in a warm orange glow that's reminiscent of a sepia photograph, "Last Man Standing" is a real oddity that blends westerns, gangsters and even Kurosawa in a not-entirely-successful picture. The setting is an odd mix of a hot and sticky western town and even has a corrupt sheriff (Bruce Dern) but seems populated almost entirely by sharp-suited gangsters in old Fords, a snivelling bartender (William Sanderson) and an undertaker for whom business is good. The plot, which shouldn't be that confusing to follow, is lost in a mire of mumbling characters and possibly the dullest voice-over in history by Willis who appears to have suffered from a personality bypass. The problem is exacerbated when Willis and Walken share the screen as each of them sneer and growl at each other like a couple of grumpy old dogs instead of lighting the screen up with sparkling dialogue like the stars they are. At times, it's almost laughable.But then a scene appears when Willis gets to do some serious ass-kicking and indeed, "Last Man Standing" does not disappoint in this department. There is a strong sense that writer/director Walter Hill spent a lot of time watching "Desperado" because this film also has baddies flying through the air, bullets raining down from Willis's dual pistols (which only run out of ammo when the baddies are either dead or reloading themselves) as the screen lights up with muzzle flashes. It is jolly well done and very exciting but when the guns are holstered and Willis is smooth-talking his way into the bed of moll Lucy (Alexandra Powers), the film badly sags. There's no real pulse behind it as the film continues to tell its story, which is one that really hasn't any got much substance to it. Certainly, nothing ever feels at stake and Willis's enigmatic loner is a difficult hero to get behind. Seasoned action fans will get a kick out of this but I can't avoid the feeling that it needed something else. "Desperado" has a feeling of fun to it, a sense that its OK to laugh in places - not to mention the sexiest sidekick of the 90's, Salma Hayek. "Last Man Standing" has no joy or fun to it and in many ways, it's like Smith himself - awesome when there is a gun in its hand but without it, it's a load of nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Yojimbo story that delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mysterious drifter, identifying himself as John Smith (Bruce Willis), arrives in the small town of Jericho, at the Mexican border. As the city is controlled by two warring gangs, Strozzi's (Ned Eisenberg) and Doyle's (David Patrick Kelly), Smith starts playing both gangs against each other as a means to earn some cash as a hired gun.Yet another adapted version of Akira Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo', this time turned into a gangster film (with a touch of western). It is proof of how good that story was that, decades and multiple re-adaptations later (my favorite being Sergio Leone's 'A Fistful of Dollars'), the story still manages to be interesting and entertaining.The movie is well directed by Walter Hill, who manages to give it a very stylish yet desolate look. The cast is absolutely perfect, everyone looking and acting their roles to perfection; in special: the gang bosses, Christopher Walken as Doyle's right-hand man, Bruce Dern as the sheriff and William Sanderson as the bartender and Willis' helping hand. It is a very good action film, never boring, with very good dialogues and very stylish and entertaining action scenes which are made to be quite similar to the old Italian westerns' shoot-outs. Speaking of Italian Westerns, Bruce Willis does his best Clint Eastwood impersonation (he is, after all, playing the same role Eastwood did in Leone's film). He does the eye-squinting, often silent and very, very muffled whispering-talking with a good deal of success; however, he often comes across as too silent, being difficult to hear him sometimes (though that is really my only complaint regarding his performance). Christopher Walken too, though his character at least is given a reason for doing that.Unlike Gian Maria Volonté or Tatsuya Nakadai, Christopher Walken actually manages to upstage Bruce Willis' nameless protagonist when in scene together. Bruce Dern and Ned Eisenberg, likewise, steal the show in their scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You've Seen One Yojimbo, You've Seen Them All.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A skilled killer rides alone into a town dominated by two gangs of thugs. He double crosses both of them, kills some, provokes the rest into killing each other, and rides off into the sunset.Let's see. When Akira Kurosawa wasn't busying himself with Shakespeare, he was styling his samurai movies, of which "Yojimbo" is an example, on the Westerns of John Ford, whom he greatly admired. Enter Sergio Leone, Clint Eastwood, and "For a Fist Full of Dollars." Now there is "Last Man Standing," with Bruce Willis as the lone gunslinger. That makes this movie an American Western/Gangster imitation of a spaghetti Western imitation of a Japanese samurai movie that's an imitation of an American Western.But changes have been rung. It's now 1931 and the two rival gangs -- one Italian and one Irish -- are holed up in a deserted little Texas town a few miles from he Mexican border, across which they smuggle truck loads of illegal booze with the complicity of the corrupt Mexican police and the help of Bruce Dern, the indifferent sheriff who has no principles whatever but minds his own business.The photographer's palette is drawn from earthy colors. The tawny dust seems constantly in motion and covers everything. Sure, it's overdone. Every scene, indoors or out, seems shot through an adobe filter. But I kind of liked it. This sort of trashy movie calls for excess. The musical score is undistinguished but not irritating.Performances. Best performance award goes to -- envelope, please -- Ken Jenkins as Captain Pickett of the Texas Rangers. It's a brief scene but he's memorable. Willis seems half asleep most of the time. He belts down enough booze to stun a rhinoceros but it never seems to interfere with his gunplay. He carries two .45s in shoulder holsters. When the heavies shoot at him, they miss. Willis doesn't miss. And he doesn't simply shoot an enemy. He perforates him, sometimes with a dozen bullets, so that the body tumbles along the scrubby desert sand like a rolling pin.Willis doesn't seem to be taking the movie very seriously, a credit to his sensibilities. Neither does Christopher Walken as the Tommy-gun toting heavy hitter. Make up has given him a scar down his face, which perhaps has cut some of the feeder circuits innervating the soft parts of his features, because his expression -- his single expression -- seems borrowed from an Olmec statue. He's used a dry, grating voice that's so evil it's ridiculous.In some ways it's an amazingly innovative movie. In 1952, Shane had a hell of a time disposing of three villains in a saloon and was wounded doing it. By "Unforgiven," Clint Eastwood could outdraw and massacre half a dozen bad guys without being hit. Here, two guns blazing, Willis eliminates a gang of about a dozen scum bags. "A massacre," somebody remarks.There are two women in the story but they aren't seen very often, although the role of one of them is very important.You like menace? You like shooting? You like a noir voice over? It's all here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Hill directed this updated version of "Fistful Of Dollars", which had starred Clint Eastwood as a mysterious gunfighter named Joe, caught between two rival crime families in an old west border town. Here, Bruce Willis plays mysterious gunslinger John Smith, who also gets in the middle of two warring crime families in a small Texas town, though this time it's the Irish and Italians, rather than Americans and Mexicans. Like Joe, John will end up playing both sides against the other, then being caught and beaten, before getting his revenge. Not bad at all really, but so similar to previous film it hardly seems worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willis in Top Form in a Brilliant :"Yojimbo" Knock-Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>International filmmakers have exerted great influence on American movies. When Hollywood runs out of fresh ideas, the major studios often turn to foreign films for inspiration. Sometimes, a filmmaker appears who can adapt a foreign film in such a revolutionary way that audiences sits up and pays attention. "Extreme Prejudice" writer &amp; director Walter Hill manages this ambitious feat in his cinematic version of the 1961 Japanese samurai epic "Yojimbo" by the brilliant director Akira Kurosawa. Incidentally, "Yojimbo" translated means "bodyguard." In the 1950s and 1960s, Kurosawa emerged as one of the few Asian filmmakers who commanded the respect of American audiences. His films grew popular in the West. Moreover, Kurosawa translated profitably in westerns. His films have served as the basis for John Sturges' 1960 classic "The Magnificent Seven," Sergio Leone's landmark Spaghetti western "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964), and now Walter Hill's "Last Man Standing." Hill recycles the venerable Kurosawa tale as a Prohibition Era gangster saga, casting Bruce Willis as a tight-lipped soldier of fortune with two automatics and an attitude. The story contains all the subtlety of a hail of lead delivered at point blank range, and "Last Man Standing" erupts with the fury of an artillery barrage. The setting of Jericho, Texas, exists in a moral vacuum. The gangsters have sent all the good people packing and paid for the law as they have bought most of the women. Women decorate the periphery of "Last Man Standing' in minor roles as hostages, whores, and mistresses. These unhappy females are trapped in Jericho as male playthings and the consequences of defiance carry a high price as one girl learns. When John Smith (Bruce Willis of "Die Hard") wheels his Ford into the dusty, remote town of Jericho, he is searching for a quiet place to lay low before he vanishes into Mexico. What he encounters are two greedy Chicago bootlegging clans competing for supremacy over the illegal whiskey trade. Like Clint Eastwood in "A Fistful of Dollars," Smith smells money galore in "Last Man Standing" so he hires out his pistols to the highest bidders. Smith plays the Italians and the Irish skillfully against each other in a suspenseful game of cat and mouse. When he helps a young woman held hostage by the Irish, Smith finally pays for his interference. The Irish gang, headed by Doyle (Daniel Patrick Kelly), captures and stomps our protagonist until he resembles a bruised tomato. Somehow, Smith endures this horrible beating and gets away. Furiously, Doyle massacres the Italian leader, Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), and his gang at a roadhouse where the Irish believe Smith has filed for protection. Instead, Smith holes up out of town in a church to recover his strength. Jericho's corrupt sheriff (Bruce Dern of "The Cowboys"), decides to help Smith out by loaning him two guns. Smith takes the hardware and challenges the Irish to a Wild West showdown. As his own scenarist, director Walter Hill has kept most of the original story intact. If you're looking for comparisons, you might find it easier to correlate "Last Man Standing" with "A Fistful of Dollars" rather than "Yojimbo." As the writer, Hill fumbles in making the evil, Tommy-gun toting Hickey (Christopher Walken of "The Anderson Tapes") a henchman rather than the boss, as the corresponding character was in "A Fistful of Dollars." He is the only match bullet-for-bullet with Smith. As Hickey, Christopher Walken adds another despicable villain to his cinematic gallery of rogues, playing second fiddle to Doyle. Hill generates minor suspense when lesser characters refer to Hickey's character and the hellishness that always follows in his wake."Last Man Standing" is a raw, hard-bitten, little, B-move shoot'em-up with A-class pretensions that pays homage to not only Kurosawa but also stylishly imitates the excessive violence from recent Hong Kong crime thrillers. If you want to compare it to one of Bruce's American thrillers, the Tony Scott directed bullet ballet "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) is the best example. Hill the writer doesn't waste time contriving an elaborate plot that hinges on small but crucial details. When characters are not performing tasks on-screen, they are deployed off-screen in plot related activities. This is one who where what the characters do off-screen is of integral importance to what others do on-screen. Compared with Clint Eastwood who played the Man with No Name in "A Fistful of Dollars," Bruce Willis here is the Man With Anybody's Name. As he reveals to the Italians, he is simply John Smith from back East. John Smith is a taciturn fellow. He doesn't make a big deal out of most things unless he finds his expertise challenged. If you're a Willis fan, "Last Man Standing" isn't Bruce as usual. He is neither "Die Hard" Detective John McClane nor is he David Addison from "Moonlighting." He is a man of few words and fewer wisecracks. Smith is an unrepentant hard-case who admits as much without remorse during his opening narration. Here Willis delineates the character of Smith more out of what is left unsaid rather than said.The film amounts to a genre mash-up: a period crime drama crossed with a western. In it, the Old West is a dying dream. The New West, suggests Hill, is being taken over by business suits from back East with hardware. Nevertheless, that Wild West justice might be out of sight but it's not entirely out of mind. Altogether, "Last Man Standing" qualifies as a loud, bloody shoot'em-up that shouldn't disappoint action fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice mood but not much content</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film doesn't do much wrong except not really doing much right. The mood and feel of a small American western town in Prohibition is nicely put across, borrowing something from films like Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'. The acting is fine, particularly from the always-reliable Christopher Walken who once again lights up more of his role than is asked of him.But the story adaption is a little tired and Willis's "It was a dirty town but all towns were" voice-over feels dated rather than nostalgic. The bad guys are all a bit too thick to seem like adversaries so it feels like any successes of Willis's are inevitable. That makes it hard for the film to keep you wondering as the story appears to just play itself out.</fullReview>

The movie only really throws sparks when Ken 'Kelso' Jenkins pops up with the film's best performance, although there are a few signs of life whenever Christopher Walken appears. But only a few; this is a boring film, slackly paced and slathered in world weary dialogue that's less hard boiled, more over-baked. It comes off as a film that's trying too hard.</fullReview>

There were so many strange inconsistencies in this movie. How can the protagonist enter a room with at least 15 men in it, start shooting around with only 2 pistols, standing in just one place without moving, and not get hit once? Why did they beat up the protagonist, went away and came back minutes later? why not kill him directly? Why was the showdown between hickey and John Smith such a let down? Why did hickey just stand around and let smith shoot without any resistance? Why built up such a super villain just to let him die in such an easy way?Strange movie, strange ending, not a lot of entertainment. I would say a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake of a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of Clint Eastwood's Fistfull of Dollars, which in turn is a remake of Yojimbo. The movie itself is set in the 1920's yet it still has the trademark Western aspects, namely the taming of a savage land. Bruce Willis plays John Smith (which is really a man with no name) who stumbles on a border town in which two gangs fight for control. Upon learning this, Willis decides that it is in his best interest to stay in the town, play each gang up against the other, and then walk out with a lot of money.This is really an action/western style movie. It has its fair share of gunfights, but beyond that it really seems to have little to keep one interested in it. I liked the film though. The gunfights were well executed and there was a few witty remarks scattered across it. The lack of a real cohesive plot comes through the direction of the movie. It is focused on one man who decides to stick his meddling fingers into a dangerous situation. Inevitably everybody catches on to him and puts him through hell, though he manages to deal with them all in the end.The thing about Willis' character is that it has a self-admitted flaw and that is his lust for woman. He seems to be a cold hearted man but he is willing to always kick back with a lovely lady. A number of times he almost meets his end, but inevitably he manages to survive.The dusty, empty town gives it a nice feel to it, and though the movie is overtly long, it is one that Western fans and even those who like action movies should give it a go. It is not the best of movies, but it is good enough to stand on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of our most underrated Directors Walter Hill is all over this Movie. His macho style and swagger is forefront and the stylist is on his game with violence and hard edged beauty.It is Neo-Noir for sure as our Anti-Hero enters a one (dead) horse town on the border, his voice-over narration ("then I saw her and the fun started") tells us we are back with Hammett and Chandler. This one starts off with action and only lets up occasionally to fill in the dusty plot of females in distress and prohibition Gang rivalry.This one, as are most of Hill's Films, is overlooked and under-appreciated. It is a slam bang salutation to Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone. A great cast are all in on the fun and this delivers everything in the tradition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I've just watched this flick for the second time, first time was back 3 years though. There's nothing to complain about the vivid action sequences, atmosphere, acting etc. All good average. Nothing spectacular though. However: How come that this kinda movie is obviously always lacking some sort "reality advisor" in the process of the shooting of the film? How come our cool Mr. gunslinger Bruce Willis' pair of .45 auto is never empty before he has nailed every single mother****er plus the entire furnishings at the scene. Even if it takes about 25-30 rounds! Well, I happen to know that a modern .45 auto holds no more than 10 or 11 max. His ones held less by the looks of it (you get a pretty good look when he refills the magazines). Why is it, that although almost everyone in Jericho wants him dead, and there are plenty around, all of them are just so damn stupid to get close and open fire without taking aim first? Willis mostly walked around as if he was bulletproof, exposing himself like a bloody training target. All it would have taken to bring him down was a rifle and some carful aiming.Ok,ok,ok...I'm spoiling it. But, hell, after all, we're supposed to believe at least some of this s**t, aren't we? Please, make movies that are more believable than this one!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not deep, but a satisfying movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like this movie. No, it's not very deep. But really, that's not what it's about. It's a pulp-story. One thing I really found interesting, was how it seemed like a section out of a greater novel. There seemed to be an interesting story leading up to the movie, and an interesting story leading out of the movie. This mysteriousness makes the whole thing very intriguing.Another thing I really liked, was that it wasn't filled with dull-witted action-hero one liners. The dry/dark humor it does contain is sparsely, yet smartly, done. This gives the movie a very dark, gritty, rough feel...which was obviously the point.If you want something light, gun-blasting, gritty action movie, then see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar to A Fistful of Dollars, not as good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminded me a lot of A Fistful of Dollars, with the bulk of the plot being very very similar. Instead of a war between mexican bandito gangs, it's prohibition-era shootout in a small texas town. It's not bad, though the narration takes away a lot of the mystery that served Clint Eastwood's character so well in his version. Christopher Walken as Hicky is a bright spot, but even he can't save it. Ah well... Too bad A Fistful of Dollars isn't available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yojimbo done "heroic bloodshed"-style in Prohibition Era gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great non-"Hollywood" (little sentiment, no little kid characters, no white-cowboy-hat goodguy, no CGI cartoon effects, no goofy comic relief, no touching romance, no Aerosmith or Will Smith songs, no mercy for the bad guys) American film, Last Man Standing is the third telling of this story preceded by Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo and Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (both excellent films). Rather than a samurai film or a western, Last Man is a Prohibition Era gangster flick full of John Woo-influenced shootouts (enabled by the existence of early 20th century .45 automatics in this setting). Being a huge Woo fan myself I adore these scenes. They are Woo-influenced but are not ripoff imitations by amateur directors. This is Walter Hill (check the filmography). Last Man Standing is a cold brutal film with a high bodycount which may be why so many people hate it. Willis is excellent as John Smith and that is saying a lot since I only like 4 of his movies (the others being Pulp Fiction, The Fifth Element, and 12 Monkeys). If you are a fan of highpowered action films, Walter Hill, Christopher Walken, or Bruce Willis check this movie out. If you're not, what did you expect?</fullReview>

Point blank range doesn't need your traditional competitive stance crap--especially with the world's greatest gun, a .45. But anyway, back to my opine of the movie.

		<fullReview>an amoral gunslinger in the days of Prohibition, on the run from his latest exploits, happens upon the town of Jericho, Texas. It has become more like a ghost town, since two warring gangs have driven off all the decent folk. Smith sees an opportunity to play both sides off against each other, earning himself a nice piece of change as a hired gun. Despite his strictly avowed mercenary intentions, he finds himself risking his life for his, albeit skewed, sense of honour....Made at a time when Willis was struggling to make it big at the box office, it comes as no surprise that this disappeared pretty rapidly at the cinema.But it's still a solid action movie, which is slightly tarnished as a remake of a remake and so on.Willis is great as always as John, the gunslinger who is playing off each gang. Hill directs the action pieces with expertise, and it's a lovely move having Walken appear int he second act, all the time before with his gang mentioning him in passing.Why this cost so much to make, I have no idea, because the production values are not the best, but it has an eclectic cast, who really know how the liven up an average script.There are plot holes aplenty, but it's a swift movie, with hardly any pauses, and it's one of Willis' hidden gems.See it as a throwaway action movie, and you'll enjoy it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so clearly this is simply John McClains grandfather during the prohibition years in the United States. John McClain is Bruce Willis in Die Hard. For those living who have not heard of or watched the Die Hard movies my question is to you, WHY!?! This movie is essentially Die Hard in every single way except John Smith (Bruce Willis) is not a cop, he isn't exactly the good guy but he shoots off his gun about 1200 times and gets beat up a few times. He doesn't talk much and when he does, he is grumpy. He essentially comes back from a hopeless scenario that should have left him dead as Demi Moore career. And did I mention he shoots his gun? For those looking for a dramatic and amazing film. Keep looking. This movie is just another Die Hard that is hidden under a different backdrop and time. And its awesome. Has always been awesome, always will be awesome. It's a great movie and my fourth favourite movie staring Bruce Willis, can you guess what the first three are? DIE HARD!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will enjoy this shoot'em up film. I wouldn't say that this is a cinema masterpiece but it is still pretty good.If the plot seems familiar to you it is because this is a remake of a Akira Kurosawa movie. Sergio Leone did a version of this story as well.Bruce Willis stars and other actors include Christopher Walken and Bruce Dern. A couple of performances are a little over the top while a couple of other performances are a little understated. The result is slightly uneven but that doesn't really matter because the dialogue is generally kept short.I am not really a fan of voice over but here it didn't bother me too much. My biggest problem with this movie is the number of times Bruce Willis fires his guns (twin 1911s) without reloading. In one scene he actually changes magazines with fairly realistic regularity but in others he fires like 30-40 rounds without reloading.So if you like guns, booze, broads, and tough guy characters then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If the ultimate red blooded macho male prayed to the gods for a movie...they would give him Last Man Standing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this the greatest movie in history? YES!! Okay not really but Last Man Standing is one of the bloodiest, over the top, macho action flicks I have ever seen. I saw it years ago and loved it so watching it again only made me remember just how absolutely kick butt this movie is. Where can you possibly begin? A remake of an old Eastwood western...big points there, you don't get cooler than Eastwood and Fistful of Dollars is a stone cold classic. Mobsters. Check plenty of them. The setting of the film is like a modern day 1930's desolate Western town. It incorporates three different distinct time periods and genres. Throw in the top action star of the time and buckets of blood and bullets with a solid, if not timeless story, and this movie will have you blown through the back of your living room. The plot is simplistic because it literally thrives on action and just plain bad ass-ness. I read reviews for this film that hated it and I read reviews that loved it and I understand both sides. This is literally the epitome of action flicks. If you love action and haven't seen this film...you don't even know what action is.Bruce Willis was probably in his prime in 1996 when this film was made. This also wasn't considered a highlight in his career which just isn't right because it should have made him the all time action hero in Hollywood history (although I think he already is to me.) Willis is the tough as nails, quiet, brooding, deadly killer 'John Smith', the only name he gives in the film. He is perfect in the role and he literally carries the whole film. This is why he is who he is to his fans. How else could you make this film more amazing? Add the incredible Christopher Walken! Walken plays cold blooded mob hit-man Hickey. Walken is amazing in everything he does but the problem with him in this film is his character is toned way down. Its still amazing to see him opposite Willis and he has some great scenes but he could have been so much more and a pure adversary to Willis rather than just a supporting characters. David Patrick Kelly and Ned Eisenberg are the leaders of the warring gangs. Both are good in their roles but not outstanding. They don't really seem threatening or even a threat to Willis and are easily manipulated but essentially everyone in this film is fodder for Willis to blow away. Michael Imperioli would have been better as one of the head guys but he does very well playing the beloved cousin of Eisenberg's character. Imperioli is high strung and excellent in his role. Karina Lombard and Alexandra Powers are the mistresses of the two gang leaders that Willis uses to really get both men against each other. Both women are just there to serve their purpose and neither hold any majority in the cast or show anything spectacular. And finally although top credited Bruce Dern plays the twisted Sheriff living off protecting both gangs. Dern is good, very good in fact but he has such a small role in the film. I would like nothing more than to have seen Dern and Walken in much bigger roles.As you may have noticed despite my high review of the film the supporting cast don't do much of anything except make for great enemies for Willis to blow away because that is what this film is...Willis playing games with the various factions and then wiping them off the planet with guns blazing in the most outrageous and violent kills. Having brought us some truly classic films if not underrated Walter Hill writes and directs the film. He shows an absolutely unique style with the film and doesn't concern himself with minute details but instead makes them mysterious like Willis' background and why he's on the run, and when this whole thing takes place and so on. On an enormous 70 million dollar budget (easily understandable given the stunts and warfare and gunfire) it didn't even open at 20 million dollars but I assure you that's an oversight because you will watch this film again and again once you've had the pleasure of watching the simplicity of pure adrenaline fuelled action. 9/10</fullReview>

Last Man Standing is not a masterpiece or original but it doesn't always have to be.It's just very tough and straight to the point(or your head) with some plot twists.You can taste the dust,feel the hot gun barrels,you can smell something rotten and you got to love Willis and Walken in this movie. I wanted to comment this movie because 6 isn't what it deserves.So,if you have nothing to do,rent or buy and go and watch it. Especially if you're a Walter Hill and even maybe a John Woo fan,cause the action scenes are very nicely done.Beware of Hickey,he's kinda scary..My Rate:7.5/10</fullReview>

Walter Hill created a masterpiece, and don't say that: "It's just another Hollywood-style remake." Not it's not! Remember, that The Fistful of Dollars was a remake of Yojimbo!

The finale is especially awesome, and the ending was really cool too, plus it keeps you guessing throughout!. This is an excellent gritty no holds barred shoot 'em up with a great story and fantastic performances all around, and i say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is awesome. Walter Hill does an awesome job here, with great camera work, awesome angles and keeping the film at an exciting pace!. There is quite a bit of blood and violence. We get hundreds of extremely bloody gunshot wounds, and an incredibly harsh bloody beating!. The Acting is wonderful!. Bruce Willis is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he kicks that ass, had a very likable character, had a great no bullsh*t look on his face, was intense, was good in his emotional scene near the end, carried the film and just did an amazing job overall! (Willis Rules!!!!!!). Christopher Walken is fantastic as always and is fantastic here, he was quite frightening here, as he showed no remorse, or guilt for what he was doing, was extremely menacing, and gave a memorable performance! (Walken Rules!). Bruce Dern is great as the sheriff and was likable i liked him a lot. William Sanderson is great as the bartender, he was funny, and likable , he did a great job!. David Patrick Kelly is good as the other villain, although he tested my nerves at times, he was energetic, and did his job well. Alexandra Powers is stunningly gorgeous, and did excellent in her screen time, and had decent chemistry with Willis. Ned Eisenberg(Strozzi),Michael Imperioli(Girogio) and Karina Lombard(Felina) all do what they have to do well. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is desperately weak with virtually no plot and Bruce Willis looking as constipated as ever. His voice-overs reminding you that he is a tough guy and grate after the first five minutes. Willis wanders aimlessly around a town which seems to have a population of twenty people first working for one gang, then the other. Why they don't just shoot each other as they are sworn enemies we aren't told. Presumably they are waiting for a hard man like Willis to turn up and do it for them. Perhaps most offensive is Willis slamming a prostitute against a wall for no apparent reason though it jostles with him shooting a man for damaging his car. Throughout the film any viewer with any sense will find it hard to engage with the pointlessly violent and unlikeable character Willis portrays. It is amazing that some people actually see this as a significant film. A crass prohibition era version of a western with little to recommend it. As the sheriff points out late in the film 'It makes no sense me helping you' - indeed it doesn't, but why worry now when the entire film makes no sense? A dismal film only likely to appeal to those excited by seeing a man blown ten feet backwards by a pistol shot.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are quite funny and do well playing two rough and tumblin' gunmen. Willis' oneliners are of course entertaining as is his "too cool for school" acting.  There's only one problem. The king of "too cool for school" acting, great oneliners and westerns, Clint Eastwood, already made this movie thirty years earlier when it was called "A Fistful of Dollars." These scripts are so identical I don't know how it was made and why Clint didn't sue.The only difference I can tell is the time period. Clint's actually takes place as most westerns in the wild wild west, during the civil war or reconstruction. "Last Man standing" apparently takes place in the early thirties during prohibition. Lets see: both movies have a war being fought between two rival gangs-the main character plays both sides-the slow bartender helps him-main character gets his ass whiped when he tries to help the girl who is held against her will-even the opening scenes(if you can see through time) are the exact same. Clint rides into town on his mule-some white guys insult him and his mule, Clint gets even. Willis rides into town in his car-some white dudes insult him and bust up his car-Bruce gets even.</fullReview>

Add to this the unlikely prospect of a derelict town with, apparently, only two inhabitants, located in a desert, being terrorised by two gangs, each vying with the other for both the accolade of sartorial excellence and the profits from various nefarious activities, but who are, apparently, out-thought and out-gunned by a stranger in a ramshackle old car, who needs to fire about 30 bullets to see off one man, perhaps leading one to believe that an eye-test, followed by a course in the effective use of fire-arms, might not go amiss ? Nevertheless, our hero, by adhering closely to the script, triumphs after all, and is, as far as can be ascertained, left as the 'Last Man Standing' At the end, you might be forgiven for asking what it was all about, as this film contains lots of action, but little else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Man Standing, loosely based on Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, is one of the better performances that Bruce Willis has turned out. It's a lot better than the crap that he has been putting out lately. Walter Hill knows how to make a tough action film and this one is no different. Ry Cooder's gritty soundtrack lends a edge to the film that soundtracks seldom do. Chris Walken and Bruce Dern do their part to flesh out the background of colorful characters. The women in the film are not dwelled on and their existence in the film doesn't matter anyway since they don't do any kind of justice to the movie. Bruce's John Smith is the perfect antihero, a bad guy that you can't help rooting for. His playing of the Irish and Italian gangs is beautiful and the twin blasts of his .45 autos help make his point. On the subject of these gunfights though, it must be said that not only does he manage to get like 30 shots out of two 8 round clips but his slugs blow people up into the air. It is my only problem with otherwise spectacular gunfights that are the best this side of John Woo. Bottom Line: This movie is a serviceable action/gangster flick that deserves for you to rent it at least once if not buy it. Don't look for a deep plot or meaningful characters, just sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis plays John Smith who arrives in a quiet town called Jericho, where there are two gangs fighting against each others.Smith gets in the middle of it all and starts the war of his own.Last Man Standing is a great dramatic action western. It has plenty of cool shooting scenes.Bruce Willis is just the right man to play John Smith.So if you like shooting and Bruce Willis watch Last Man Standing.The movie is better than said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a lot in common with "Desperado". It would be unbearably lousy to watch if it wasn't for the extremely stylish gunfights that take place every now and then. As for logic, credibility or any kind of surprise - don't expect any of it.But there is one thing more that I like apart from the shooting. I like the dust that seem to permeate even the cameras. It's everywhere. It's the dust that settles the tone of this film and it's the dust that decides the feeling of it. Every color is affected by it, and not even indoors is one protected from it.So - I like the guns. And the dust. Other than that, it's not worth watching. But I would like to own it so I could watch it some rainy day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine violent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, this isn't Kurosawa, but is an action movie and it works really well. I really feel that if you don't like (or know) one genre you shouldn't be making public comments on movies of such genre. The people who didn't like this movie probably didn't like 48 hours or any other Walter Hill movie. If one person loved 'Emma'or 'Pretty Woman' will probably hate 'Last man...' (I liked both, though. But I wouldn't comment on them). If I want character development or plot I'll surely look for Fellini , Bergman or Kurosawa. When you want action, Walter Hill is one of the best and if it is with Bruce Willis, better. So, if you want action, this picture is great! Abstain if you don't like violence in movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fireworks display full of nonstop action, gunfire, and a deliciously high body count. LAST MAN STANDING is a bullet riddled frenzy.Akira Kurosawa's YOJIMBO (1961) gets a revitalized reworking here in this updated tale of "every man for himself." Director Walter Hill (RED HEAT, STREETS OF FIRE, THE WARRIORS) promises the high caliber virtuosity. Also, for the sake of those drama connoisseurs, Hill has added class with a touch of loyalty, the obsession of money, bootlegging, and betrayal.The setting is during the Prohibition Era approximately dating back to the 1920s. Taking place in the small town of Jericho, Texas, a loner with a B.A. standing for "brass attitude" enters the scene, with the sole goal of making easy cash.His quick reflexes and amazingly perceptive intuition have caught the attention of both the organized gangs running this dried up, soon-to-be abandoned desert town. The soul's incognito is most appropriately, "John Smith." Bruce Willis (DIE HARD trilogy, THE SIEGE, ARMAGEDDON) is demure as the soft-spoken stranger who takes no official sides in this competition. Although he apparently is working in conjunction with one particular gang at first, he abruptly switches allegiance...and this is no way to make a friend here in the dangerous side of Jericho...As Smith eventually double crosses both sides, he purposely precipitates a rival gang war with innumerable casualties and fatalities...LAST MAN STANDING is a ruthless, bite-the-bullet masquerade that exactly knows what the audience wants. This film jolts the jugular with an electrifying fixation on audacity. Fast paced and gritty, with some compelling character angles, LAST MAN STANDING is still nothing at times but a very violent film which delivers maximum hits that fans of the genre will crave.The talented cast is great. David Patrick Kelly is Doyle, the leader of one of the domineering organized gangs. Christopher Walken portrays a taciturn yet conniving facially scarred gangster who serves as Doyle's right hand man. Bruce Dern is tough as the Sheriff of this broken town. William Sanderson is Joe, the bartender who befriends Smith. Finally, Leslie Mann fulfills her role as an innocent bystander pulled into the crossfire.The moody musical score composed by Ry Cooder (STREETS OF FIRE) is excellent. Also, unlike similar genre action flicks, one must pay attention to the important dialogue in LAST MAN STANDING. Watching Mr. Smith manipulate both gangs is quite captivating, exploiting their gullibility and exposing their weaknesses towards greed and power.The violence in LAST MAN STANDING is also excessive at times with a body count surpassing a good majority of action flicks. The way John Smith shoots through his adversaries is highly preposterous, but reasonably entertaining. Many of the "torture" scenes portrayed in this film are sadistic and sickening.It's good to see that Walter Hill has finally acceded credit to someone else instead of vainly claiming this project to be his own. Anyway, LAST MAN STANDING is an above average thriller. LAST MAN STANDING is one of Walter Hill's most recognized projects. The cast and crew have definitely dedicated their time and effort into this piece in order to give an authentic feel of the "gangster" life and times during the turmoil which occurred in the 1920s.RATING: **1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Man Standing has an interesting cast and setting, but it only manages to mildly entertain. This is purely a man-night movie for Bruce Willis fans and not much else.As far as a piece of cinema, this film was lacking in a lot of ways. The plot was paper thin with generally flat characters. The movie takes place in a Texas border town going ghost town in the prohibition era. Its only inhabitants anymore are two rival gangs, the barman, a few easy women, a corrupt sheriff, a grease monkey/gas station attendant, and the mortician. In comes a wandering gun-for-hire, and the action begins. The setting seems a little confused as a gangster/western hybrid, so the plot can only be expected to be a battle to fit the title. Most of the characters are pretty typical of the gangster and western genres. The few that you attach any interest in don't change at all from beginning to end (except for one secondary character).From a director's/cinematographer's angle, I don't think the film ever decides what it wants to be. It tries to emulate noir with the anti-hero male lead complete with his voice over narration. This doesn't really work out because the film lacks the moodiness of noir. It tries to be a western with the gritty feel and quick-draw shootouts. It tries to be a gangster film with the bullet happy murders and an organized crime power struggle. Separately, these are great, but I don't think both fit well together in this case.If you're looking for a few one liners, cheesy shootouts, Bruce Willis or Christopher Walken, then this might be your film. I would say give this film a chance in general, but you should not expect to see a quality film from this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly westernized remake of Kurosawa's classic "Yojimbo"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ultimately, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone who has not already seen the classic film "Yojimbo", of which this is an adaptation. Last Man Standing is in essence very close to the Kurosawa original, though it strays in a few key places. Incidentally, those places where it subtly deviates are the places where the plot becomes confused and disjointed. To say more, I would have to include some spoilers, so I will leave it at that.On the subject of the action sequences, whether or not it can be seen as an improvement over Yojimbo is largely in the eye of the beholder. Where the action sequences are quite gritty and believable in Yojimbo, the exact opposite could be said of Last Man Standing. "Over the top" doesn't quite go far enough to describe the giggle-inducing spectacle of grown men flying ~20 feet through the air after being shot with a .45 pistol. If that sounds like your idea of awesome, you may yet enjoy Last Man Standing. Otherwise, pass on this half-hearted American remake and go for the classic source instead, "Yojimbo" and its excellent sequel, "Sanjuro".As a post script note, the idea that "Yojimbo" (and in turn "Last Man Standing") is actually based on the earlier novel "Red Harvest" is a point of some debate. Suffice it to say, they are sufficiently different that there is no compelling reason to credit Red Harvest for either Yojimbo or Last Man Standing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killed by a sluggish pace and mumbling where intelligence and complexity would have made it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Smith is just passing through the town of Jericho, a dusty nowhere town fifty miles from the Mexican border and not on any map. The town is a hub for alcohol smuggling to feed the rest of the country during prohibition but essentially it has become a town of two parts. On one side is the Italian mob and on the other the Irish. When Smith gets targeted by one of the mobs, Smith sees the opportunity to put himself in the middle of the power struggle and make some quick cash before moving on.Yojimbo has been remade many times. Sometimes it is clear and sometimes it is different enough so that no money need change hands. From my limited experience some of them are good (Per un Pugno di Dollari) and sometimes they are not (Van Damme's Coyote Moon or Rutger Hauer's Omega Doom). Last Man Standing seemed to offer the chance for an intelligent and exciting updating to the world of the depression-era gangster. Looking back it struggled to even cover the huge wodge of cash given to Bruce Willis in box office returns but this is not always a clear indication of quality ? only that it failed to find an audience.Despite the potential in the concept, the director and the stars, the film never really gets off the ground. Hill and his team do a good job of creating a convincing dry atmosphere of simmering tension in the film but the material itself is not as sharp or slick as it really needed to be. Instead it seems to match the desert heat by moving along at a comparative crawl ? thematically correct perhaps but at times it is painful. It does have good moments but mostly it drags along without enough going on action or substance wise to cover for it.Willis doesn't help proceedings one bit. Perhaps it was the huge fee that he commanded or him feeling like he was at the height of his powers, but he practically sleeps his way through the film. His mumbling seems like it was an attempt at a brooding anti-hero but you don't just achieve that by mumbling ? it needs to be who your character is, not just how he talks. As it is he has presence but no charisma or menace. The support cast is deep with names and it is hard for the presence of Dern, Sanderson, Walken, Kelly, Imperioli and others not to be a positive influence but sadly they don't do enough ? Walken in particular I expected more from.Overall then, an atmospheric film whose desperately slow pace and brooding mumbling may appeal to some viewers who mistake it for depth. However what I saw was a clever plot ground down by inertia while I sat struggling to stave off boredom from the delivery. Could have been good ? isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had the potential to be a real thoughtful story about the inability to escape one's past. Regardless of its lineage from the earlier (better) movies it's based on, this one should have been able to hold its own. It has all the elements, even some great camera work and acting - Walken is always good, about as close to a lock for a great performance in a character part as there is. But this movie lacks a center. Bruce Willis is good in the part, but there are some missed opportunities with him. The script lets him - and the rest of the cast - down. Most every character is either stupid and clueless or else we're missing something. A very lame and ineffective voiceover does not help.However, I liked the action and appreciated the beautiful brutality for what it was. A gunplay-movie very nicely done, but an opportunity wasted for a quality movie.I also have to say that the detuned bass musical score by Ry Cooder is nothing short of awesome. See it for that alone - it's that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, brutal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not for everyone. Perhaps Walter Hill's greatest asset is the same as his greatest flaw--he makes movies that Sam Peckinpah would have made. And there are some who really hate good old Bloody Sam. This is a very brutal flick, lots of death and destruction, which most movies these days seem to have. But it's sweatier here, angrier, more real while being a basic fantasy. The entire cast seems to need be in need of a bath, Bruce Willis, it's probably the grittiest sweatiest movie since, well since "Fist Full of Dollars," which as many have noted, it is a remake. And of course, that was a remake of Yojimbo. This is not a movie to make you smile, or to make you laugh. It's one of those that is by and large for men. A night to sit around with a bottle of whiskey and not bathe. Meaning, don't hit this one with a date, unless maybe she's in a biker gang or something. If you like sweaty grimy male action type movies, with grit, try this one out. If you're into Fried Green Tomatoes, you might try something less strong--something like ordering a white wine spritzer rather than a shot of straight bourbon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Henry and Kristl observed Last Man Standing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One thing is for sure.. they're all better of dead.." Kristl repeated the lines. Kristl and Henry were having a cup of tea in their garage-turned-movie- theater while the movie credits rolled past. They had replayed that last part of the movie because they both liked the movie."Yes?" Henry said, looking at Kristl trying to figure out where she was going with those lines, quoted directly from the movie. "Pity they just forgot to finish the job properly and kill of the whole cast including Bruce Willis." Kristl said."Uhmm" Henry was somewhat distracted by the exit sign that was flickering at the edge of his vision. He suspected that the light-bulb would fail in the near future. "I mean, there is nothing against remaking a movie. And this is, I heard, the official remake of Yojimbo, the classic movie made by Kurosawa, which was redone some years later as a Fistful of Dollars with Clint Eastwood. But it has turned out to be a completely superfluous movie done by the numbers that does not compare in any way to either movies. There is simply nothing memorable about this movie unless it is the totally ridiculous fighting scenes where Bruce Willis somehow survives getting shot at by ten men armed with guns, shotguns, dual pistols, despite them fellows firing first and firing from distances down to ten paces." Kristl said."Well.. it was a nice try? and was entertaining.. I mean it has Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken. Walken is always a nice bad guy and he does that again, considering that he is only to be seen for a few minutes. And William Sanderson is in it. I always liked William.. He should get better roles.. maybe a main lead in a Coen brothers movie.""I just got the feeling his role resembled the one from Blade Runner a bit too much. Like somehow he is good at playing slightly retarded people.. or seemingly retarded people. And it is this role he plays here, again.""Heh.""When I try very hard, i mean really really hard, then what I can come up with, is that the music at the end is nice and some of the landscape shots, the few there are, are nice. The rest is just.. plain nothing. The whole story stumbles along and nothing remotely interesting happens.""I am sorry.. I can not remember anything else, except that it is a decent action film." Henry shrugged."When I try to think of what wrecks the film the most I have to either choose: the utterly ridiculous setting; a mob war in western town set in the mid-twenties, or casting mr smith(nobody) as a film noir guy that talks with an boring overvoice. I mean.. the overvoice simply wrecks the whole character because we know what he is thinking and through this thinking we know what his motives are.. and this is exactly that we do not know in the other two movies because we are left to wonder whether the destruction of both gangs by nobody is either the result of good intentions or bad intentions. This is an anti-hero.. ambiguous.. unknown. The overvoice simply kills that.""But what probably undoes the whole movie is that the movie does nothing remarkable with the new angles.. If it has to be a mob movie, then do something with it.. and if the character is a film noir character it is more than drinking whisky, having an overvoice and being beaten up.. and having someone vaguely act as a femme fatale. The dialogue is superior uninteresting.""Uhm." Henry said under the waterfall over sentences."But actually it is not surprising because the director, Walter Hill, has never made any remarkable movie. In fact he makes middle-of-the- road-action movies and when he gets the possibility to remake a classic movie and actually show he might be able to do more with the material he gets, he chickens out and makes another middle-of-the-road-action movie.. which is what the last man standing basically is.""Quite. You know the music is from Mr.Ry Cooder?""Oh.. That explains why I like it.""...Say, Kristl?" Henry said after a few moments of silence."Yeah?""What would you have done if you had been ask to make the movie?""Uhm.""Well.. considering you never made a movie in your life.. what would you have done?""Well you do not need to have made a movie to judge them..""Yes, I know.. but what would you have done.. I am curious.""Well. maybe it would..perhaps.. have taken William Sanderson character as the main or the undertaker.. or maybe? have them merged.. So that the whole story is from a different angle.. perhaps have the mob war really take place in a city.. where the mob is and have cut out the overvoice and make the hero Sanderson, a really film noir guy.""Ah.""And used an expressionistic movie style.. because I like the third man.""And have everyone die in the end?""Yeah.. ""Will be an arty movie, I suppose.""Probably. Not a middle of the road action movie.""No..and probably one that lost money.""Yeah.. but it would be memorable.. hah" Kristl said.Because someone lost a lot of money or because it was arty? Henry thought in overvoice."Either way.." Krislt said with a smile, "Or both.."www.meritcoba.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ry Cooder on soundtrack duty and Chris Walken as a psychotic with a tommygun? Count me in!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A familiar story, well executed.For me the key with this film is not that it's basically been done before, but (as with any remake, 're-imagining,' or sequel)whether it succeeds in its own right as a good film and a good story. I'd say yes to both, in this case.Bruce Willis is a good actor, often unfairly pigeonholed as one of limited range. He acquits himself well in this piece, as do most of the other lead parts. Christopher Walken, a phenomenon and one that elevates even substandard fare, is great in this as yet another over-the-top villain, albeit a softly-spoken one. Some of the supporting actors vary a bit but, as an ensemble, it's all fine. The cinematography is great.The story? Well, as soon as I watched the trailer, before playing the film, I knew it was "Yojimbo" revisited. Of course, Walter Hill (like many, a fervent admirer of Kurosawa) makes no secret of this and the story is credited to the writers of that influential Japanese film. Indeed, I have a very strong feeling that the rain sequence in this film (one noted on the boards here..and, yes, it certainly does rain in US deserts)is tribute to Kurosawa, because it seems like it rains on most Kurosawa films, especially during heavy action pieces. If you've perused IMDb regarding this film at all you'll already know that this is derived from that Kurosawa film as well as Sergio Leone's "A Fistful of Dollars" that, in turn, was basically a remake of "Yojimbo," Kurosawa's masterpiece in itself basically lifted from a book or books by Dashiell Hammett. So the story's hardly original but, to be fair, neither was that of the two films to which everyone compares this piece and, indeed, the story's such a timeless one that it's likely been written down or part of oral traditions many more times than we know of.One thing is apparent in comparing this film to "Yojimbo" and even Leone's film: the humor is much less apparent. In this, if nothing else, the edge goes to the earlier films. Certainly, with no offense intended to Messrs Willis or Eastwood, Toshiro Mifune was a powerful actor and it'd be hard to top his performance in anything. Still, this is a worthy effort, with the firepower amped up considerably, and worth a look even to fervent admirers of directors Kurosawa and Leone.Besides, Christopher Walken going nuts with a tommygun? That's classic cinema, right there...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unless mindless shootemups are your cup--or septic tank--of entertainment, skip Walter Hill's Last Man Standing, a gory, lifeless, and unforgivably dull remake of A Fistful of Dollars.Bruce Willis zombies his way through two hours of ear splitting gunfire, comic book characterizations, and story-telling illogic, only to drive off in the sunset "as broke as when (he) started." Instead of The Man With No Name, Willis' character is named John Smith, and Eastwood's MWNN was a Jim Carrey-like whirling dervish compared to Bruce. He sleepwalks through the movie and mumbles platitudes, all the while dispensing justice with twin Colt .45 Automatics.Hill's direction is so listless--on its own--that you walk away from the movie feeling more than anything else, saddened. He used to be a great talent, but Hill must have felt that he needed to be the last director standing. He wasn't.Drive on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Last Man Standing" with Bruce Willis might be called "Yojimbo For Dummies".It quickly covers the main parts of the story so that you are not bored with subtleties. Actually it is a remake of a remake of a remake. Let's follow the trail.The story originated in Dashiel Hammet's novel "Red Harvest" written many years earlier than any of the films."Red Harvest" took place in a large racket-infested American City in the 20's and Kurosawa set his masterpiece "Yojimbo" in Japan as a Samurai adventure.But the story structure is essentially the same. Later it was remade with Clint Eastwood as "Fistful of Dollars." So you might say that "Last Man Standing" (gangsters) is a remake of "Fistfull of Dollars" (cowboys) which is a remake of "Yojimbo" (Samurai) which was a re-telling of "Red Harvest" (gangsters).So now it seems the tale has come full cycle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mannieristic film, takes the Yojimbo story (Kurosawa samurai movie) into 1930's Texas with a couple of irish and italian gangs fighting it off with Al Capone Era automatic weapons. There are similarities between this film and these two other films: Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leone's "Per Un Pugno Di Dollari": - the role of the shop keeper in the middle between the two fighting families; - the woman held by one of the families; - the lone man hero getting beat up and his escape; - the home burning of one of the families; One trait in the story displayed in Kurosawa's and Leone's films, however, is not followed in this version. In "Yojimbo", one person has a pistol where everyone else has a sword, giving him an advantage. In "Per Un Pugno di Dollari", Ramon Rojo has a rifle, warning the Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood) that a man with a rifle will always beat a man with a pistol, here shown as an advantage of one over the other. It is only with wit that the disadvantaged character prevails over the one with the advantage in weaponry. I didn't see the equivalent is this remake. For a moment I thought it was the automatic rifle that Hickey used, but this weaponry advantage wasn't exploited to convey the trait found in the original story. The Man With No Name in Leone's film had to wear a steel plate under his poncho to wit his opponent out, and so did Sanjuro in Kurosawa's film, but John Smith didn't have to. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a very interesting combination of Film Noir and Western. The noir elements include wardrobe, use of shadows voice-overs, a "femme-fatale", a cynical protagonist ....the list goes on and on. On the other hand, the setting is a typical western ghost town with a stranger who shows up out of no where to clean it up of all the crime and immorality. This film even makes references to classic westerns. For example, there is a scene in which John Smith (Bruce Willis) is balancing himself on a chair outside of a bar. This had to be a re-enactment of a famous scene in "My Darling Clementine" where Wyatt Earp, a new Marshall in town confidently sways back in forth in a town full of enemies.This film also has it's share of testosterone pumping action. The contrast of tommy guns in an old western town is pretty interesting. The cinematography and directing in this film are not outstanding, but I have no complaints. I would only recommend this film to those who are familiar with the basic element of a western and film noir. I took a course in high school on those two genres so I really enjoyed watching how they were conglomerated into one film. I talked to a few action buffs about this film and they said that they could not sit through the whole thing even though it's less than two hours long.

		<shortDescription>Useless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the second remake of the movie "Yojimbo" after "Per un pugno di dollari". Both of them are very good movie and this remake was really useless. This movie has nothing more than both of the previous ones and is even far from being as good. Bruce Willis, not showing all his talent, may not be as good as Clint Eastwood but the director is really far from Sergio Leone. There is no magic in this movie, just violence and nothing to enjoy watching it. To be avoided.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I notice that one review here mentions Hammett's "Red Harvest" -- a couple mention "Fistful of Dollars" and more mention "Yojimbo", since it's credited at the beginning.Well, Kurosawa has admitted in interviews that "Yojimbo" is an uncredited adaptation of "Red Harvest" (with some elements of "The Glass Key", i believe)...Actually, i think Hill might have better credited the Hammett than the Kurosawa, but perhaps that would have cost more.Not a great film, but interesting. ((Interested persons can see how SF writer David Drake handled the same Hammett material in his novel of space mercenaries, "The Sharp End", BTW))</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I was not with my girlfriend at the time I would have left before it ended. What was the point of this film? So a group of gangsters have control of this little town I assume someplace in the American Southwest and spend most of their time shooting each other. Maybe its a fort of some kind because no one else but gangsters seem to live there. Who would? I mean it always seems to be windy with dust blowing all around so it is hard to make heads or tails of any of the action. Oh yeah there only seems to be one woman to go around. And she has one ear.Bruce Willis plays some loner who comes to town that does not really takes sides but you never really know if he is a good or bad guy....but by the end of the film he gets into a gun battle with about 12 men with only 2 pistols that is beyond ridiculous. Of course he wins and that is that. Sorry my review is vague but that is how the film is....the only character that sparks any interest is the one played by Christopher Walkin. Total crazy man....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Violence, even strong violence, is ok in a film, if, like Sam Peckinpah - the George Balanchine of movie violence - you know how to integrate it into a worthwhile story line with some inherent meaning. With this flick, it looks like all the egregiously bloody shoot-em-'up scenes were filmed first, and then a desperate search was undertaken to find some way to string them together. The film is just a pointless parade of gore, a nihilist orgy of screen violence. I expected more with people like Christopher Walken and Bruce Dern involved, but I guess a paycheck is a paycheck. Bruce Willis is a far better actor than this film would make you believe. On a lesser level of complaint, finding gangs of men fully dressed in 3-piece suits in a sagebrush backwater town in ninety-degree heat would not have been likely in the 20's. And where are the residents of this seedy burg? The only other characters we see other than the gangsters and their molls is the sheriff and the garage mechanic, which doesn't make it seem likely that there is enough business to sustain not 1 but 2 Chicago-style gangs. A complete waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreary, flat and as weighty on confusing plots as it is on mindless shooting; Last Man Standing takes more time than is welcome to reach its titular scenario.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A key thing that hints at exactly what it is you're letting yourself in for when it comes to Walter Hill's 1996 film Last Man Standing, is encapsulated in a line of dialogue somebody says well into this stodgy, mid-90s Western. After observing the aftermath of a shootout in a lonely, desolate structure on the outskirts of an equally lonely, desolate Texan town; a gangster stands there in awe at the masses of dead bodies of people he used to know before noting that it "must've taken about fifteen guys to wade this kind of destruction..." such was the magnitude of the the threat facing anybody foolish enough to take on a house full of gun wielding gangsters. As it turns out, it didn't take fifteen guys; in fact, Bruce Willis' lone gunslinging gangster character did it all by himself with only his duel Colt pistols to show for it. All you need to know is in that little exchange, that the impossible; downright ridiculous and often quite dull is possible and that it's frequent in its happening within a film that begins routinely enough before falling away into an incomprehensible plethora of gunfights, ever-shifting and ever-confusing allegiances as well as a patchy story.As mentioned, it is Bruce Willis playing the lead; a wandering individual whom wades on into the town of Jericho on the Mexican/Texas border during America's Prohinition era where rival Italian and Irish gangs battle for supremacy in the illegal race to smuggle out alcohol. Rather than pay attention to character, the film is overly reliant on Willis' on-screen demeanour which comes with the sorts of characters he's known for playing, namely the tough son-of-a-gun whom doesn't ever go down without and fight and, in fact, rarely ever goes down at all. It's an attitude epitomised in the name that the film gives him, namely: John Smith, in that it is token or irrelevant; Willis here isn't playing a character with any beliefs or shifting attitudes, he's playing an archetypal meshing of a number of people he'd played prior to this 1996 effort wrapped up into one stereotypical hard-man action-man figure.The film is a revisiting to certain grounds those familiar with either Akira Kurosawa's 1961 film Yojimbo or Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars will spot quite easily, and where Leone's film was a really interesting piece about a man (in Eastwood's character) coming to terms with his selfish, self-obsessed attitudes as his presence in a small Mexican border town affected those in and around it, Last Man Standing is a muddle story of daft jumps and bland story telling: one remake; re imagining; simulacrum; update, or whatever you want to call it, just too many. It begins with Willis narrating, providing us with a sort of life lecture on right and wrong as the camera lingers on a church and its graveyard: supposed salvation on one side of the frame, death in the form of a lonely grave on the other. What follows is a picture that uses violence to solve every problem its characters face, Willis usually right on hand to dish out the majority of it.Smith rolls into town behind the wheel of his car, the signifying of films of old that have gone down the same route as this narrative before is in the form of a dead horse lying deceased and rotten in the middle of the dusty street; a Western genre convention there in reference to older texts, specifically, A Fistfull of Dollars during which the lead rode in on a horse. Smith exchanges glances with it, a recognising of the past texts that have tackled this tale; texts that just happened to have tackled this material in far more interesting and in far better ways than Last Man Standing is about to do. There's some plot in there, somewhere: Smith attempting to play the two warring sides in the form of the upmarket, cultured and rich in home interior dwelling Italians against the more dingy; more backwater Irish against one another: but for what reason other than to make a bit of money wiping people out as a hit-man, I'm not entirely sure.The Irish are run by a man called Doyle, played by an actor I am not familiar with called David Patrick Kelly, whom through his appearance just annoyingly kept reminding me of Sean Penn. Oddly, the most powerful man the Irish have on their side is in the form of a fearsome gangster named Hickey, whom gets all the verbal build up as his reputation precedes him and he himself remains off screen, only to arrive in the form of a gruffly voiced Christopher Walken doing a somewhat laughable job as this token psychopathic mob enforcer whom comes with an accent that is meant to be threatening but just ends up quite funny. Again, the film is reliant on on-screen persona and past roles as well as reputations in Walken. The film is an ugly looking mess, melodramatic and dishevelled tones masking a real lack of hard-boiled feeling the film was surely aiming for.By the end, we're meant to be on Willis' side so much more than we are anybody else's because of a sub-plot revolving around a lower-level warring against sexism or misogyny, in that Doyle keeps for himself a female sex slave accomplice in Tahiti-born actress Karina Lombard's Felina whom he believes "never had it better" when she was with him. It's an odd sub-story that is handled much more effectively in Leone's 1964 film, in that amidst all this stupid; 80s infused; badly done action spectacle is a nasty, grimy, sordid little sub-plot about what it's about. The film is full of men, more often than not standing; thus spawning a depressing sensation which settles in at around the half way mark when it transpires there's still a fair way to go until we get the "last" man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most predictable movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was watching this American shoot-'em-up Mafia/western, I noticed two things that really bugged me. First of all: the title spoiled the whole film, because by reading it you already had a very good idea what the ending was going to be like. And on top of that, this film almost constantly felt like a Wolfenstein or Max Payne-video game. There was more meaningless shooting involved in the film rather than a decent storyline or interesting characters.I was especially disappointed with Christopher Walken's character. In the film, he is said to be the ultimate bad guy, but eventually his character lacks the required attention or depth. Even so, the only decent acting comes from Christopher Walken. Bruce Willis on the other hand, plays another 'unbreakable' and therefore somewhat feeble character since he never gets hurt a single time up to a certain moment in the film.Personally, I think the movie could have been better if it wasn't so predictable plus the fact that there's too little variation in the story.</fullReview>

Bruce Dern's homage to Chester (Gunsmoke) was not worthy of either of them.

		<fullReview>Walter Hill used to be a great action director - before he started making crap."Last Man Standing" is one of those poor 1990s Bruce Willis action movies where nothing really sticks together. It doesn't have the flair and comedy of "The Last Boy Scout" or "Die Hard," nor is it as well-developed as "Pulp Fiction" or "Twelve Monkeys." It's basically Bruce running around killing people.The worst thing about this in my opinion is the awful voice-over narration. It tries to fit into the style of the old noir films from the '40s and '50s, and of course the gangster pictures of the era as well, but it instantly comes across as forced, annoying and hammy.Bruce does his Steely-Eyed Act where he just glares at people a lot and spouts a few lines here and there. It scores a ten out of ten (about on par with "Mercury Rising") on the scale of Lazy Bruce Willis Acting.When Bruce is trying he can be a fine actor ("Twelve Monkeys" being the standout) but this is essentially just an ugly, violent, boring, silly homage to the gangster flicks of long ago; it doesn't really offer anything new and as a result comes across as dull and repetitive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When (Bruce Willis) was narrating at the movie's intro about how destiny doesn't leave you having peace in your life for long, I thought that he was talking about himself ! At that phase (Willis)'s career was exactly like this : good movie, a hit, a flop, bigger flop, then being guest star in something, then it's the same round all over again. And maybe he's still living it this way till now, yet with more flops !At the time of its release on video, I rented it having high hopes. The night before I've just finished (The Last Boy Scout - 1991). The opening credits tells that it's based on a Japanese movie (Cool !). And it's an action. But really what a hellish night that I've had because of that very movie !It's absurd, with all the meanings of the word. Actually it looks like a video game, a very silly, long and uncooperative one. I mean what kind of game that doesn't allow you to play like this ?! And believe me, whatever the game that they play : you'll lose ! It got me a condition close to the flu, a really bad one, when your temperature is high, and your mind just doesn't work right, so to tell you the truth I can't recall what happened in full. All what I remember is nonstop gunfights done in damn yellow cinematography. The thing is I love the gunfights, but these ones seemed going on and on forever and ever !Still the most provocative thing is the movie's main conflict. I remember that the whole thing was about killing Mr. Willis (No.. No.. not for making the movie !). However, he was among the evil guys more than once, and they didn't DO him ??!! I couldn't understand that, and I swear I still don't !Ah.. Now I glance something else. This movie got (Christopher Walken) in it. His suit, so his hat, looked too elegant I can tell you that. Hmmm, that's all I think ! Near the end of it, I woke up. I found more gunfights. I felt that after it I might be "The last, and only, man standing"! Though, at the time, I was living a promise where it was inevitable to finish whatever movie I selected. You've got to deduce why few years later I terminated this rule ! Finally, my comment's title was in fact what the Arabic commercial title of the movie, as a rented video in Egypt, stood for (No pun intended, I kid you not). It suits it down to the ground. I bet that was the very feeling of its distributors after they watched it, which doesn't differ from mine at all. P.S: (Willis) was paid $16.5 million for being in this, while he did nothing but shooting guns. Well, some guys are luckier than the others!</fullReview>

Like most action films, it doesn't have all that much in the way of plot surprises--you can see this one coming a mile away. But instead of leaving you to figure out the already obvious plot, they had Bruce Willis comment on EVERYTHING! My guess is that the first screenings produced comments saying that it was a quiet, desolate film and they decided to throw in the narration at the very end... it would be interesting to see a cut of this film without the narration.Well... Jericho is a desolate place. It's a dusty ghosttown! A little more silence would have been appreciated. The visuals were top-notch. Acting wasn't bad--it was just the annoying voice-overs that constantly invaded with some trite drivel. Christopher Walken was a menacing (but underused) adversary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am pretty easy to please. I have liked many movies that critics have panned, BUT NOT THIS ONE! It is AWFUL! It has no redeeming value whatsoever. To start off with, the scenery is terribly boring. A drab and colorless desert town with obviously fake tumbleweed. There is no color ANYWHERE as brown and grey are the orders of the day. This would not be such a problem if there was a decent plot or script on which you could concentrate, but alas those are as bad and boring as the scenery. The movie did have action scenes, but they were ludicrous to say the least. Handguns that would not empty, aim that was perfect, and bullets that propelled humans 100 ft or more. All of that followed by a medieval banquet that was as strange as the mad hatter's tea party. With most bad movies one can find at least one redeeming factor (beautiful scenery, music, etc..), but not in this one.I must admit that I only watched the first 20 minutes of the movie as that was all I could take. I had never before walked out of a movie theater, but after those 20 minutes I was sure there was something better on TV.Don't waste any time or money on this movie. You WILL regret it.</fullReview>

You know when someone ask you what's the worst movie you've ever seen and you have to think about it? See this movie and there's no thinking about it. WORST MOVIE EVER!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God I hate remakes! Especially when they remake a great movie with a lesser actor and a lesser director. The dialog was hokey at best and it was just a pathetic attempt to make money from someone else's idea! Get a grip Hollywood there are other stories to be told. This one was told a while ago in the man with no name series, by a little known actor named CLINT EASTWOOD! If they made any money on this movie they should send it to Eastwood and Sergio Leone! What a rip off! If Bruce Willis thinks he's Eastwood then he better hope he's feeling lucky! Punk! Willis is good at Willis but leave the real Machismo to Eastwood! and write your own script.</fullReview>
