		<shortDescription>I cannot tell a lie--brilliant!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of Lillian Hellman's play "The Children's Hour" is by far more satisfying than the Audrey Hepburn-Shirley MacLaine remake in the 1960s which retained the lesbianism theme while revolving around a child's lie.Instead, this earlier William Wyler version changes the slanderous lie to a heterosexual one--and none of the power is lost in the telling of a tale about a manipulative young girl's lie that destroys the lives of three innocent people.The acting is all on an extraordinarily high level here--everyone, from Merle Oberon to Miriam Hopkins to Joel McCrea and especially little Bonita Granville (as a liar who even stoops to blackmail to keep her lie afloat). As the terrorized girl, Marcia Mae Jones is every bit as adept as the others in making the entire story a convincing one.The power of a lie to destroy others has never been more effectively played out than it is here. Under William Wyler's direction, the screenplay has been expanded with enough outdoor scenes to keep the film from seeming like a filmed stage play.Joel McCrea has never been more effective in a sympathetic role. He and Merle Oberon are impressive and wholly believable as the young lovers. Miriam Hopkins has a difficult role and she handles it brilliantly. Bonita Granville fully deserved her Oscar nomination as the monstrous girl, sparing nothing to make her one of the most hateful brats in screen history.Well worth watching for some brilliant performances and a compelling story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Children Make this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seldom highly rate the performances of child actors as they can often seem irritating, so contrived and not in the least convincing. But in this case it is the children that make me watch this movie time and again. Bonita Granville (who was unfortunate not to get an Academy Award for this) gives a remarkable performance as Mary Tilford - a real nasty piece of work if ever their was one! She is spiteful, evil and malicious and when she finally gets a slap in the face, one cannot help but rejoice (though too little too late). Marcia Mae Jones must not be forgotten. Her portrayal of the absolutely terrified Rosealie, is also very believable and when she cries and screams, you almost forget that she is just acting.For me, the adults only have secondary parts: Joel McCrea is dependable, as always, Merle Oberon is wooden and Miriam Hopkins', who gives the best performance of the three, gets my sympathy as Miss Dobie who would sacrifice her own happiness for the two people she loves most in the world. I just love the tender and self-controlled way she treats Rosealie when she finally gets the truth from her. Watch it and see what I mean. Great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love &amp; Lies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three innocent people have their lives shattered by malicious gossip.THESE THREE is a vividly acted, excruciatingly dramatic look at how unrequited love &amp; evil lies can undermine relationships and destroy reputations. Lillian Hellman authored the script (and altered the emotional bias) from her original play, The Children's Hour and director William Wyler created a film which never lets up in its emotional intensity. The viewer feels terribly for the three protagonists as they suffer unjustly and equally powerless to do anything about it.Teachers Miriam Hopkins &amp; Merle Oberon both love doctor Joel McCrea. One will win him, the other will hurt quietly. All three act at a perfect pitch, each performer complementing and supporting the other two, most especially when their characters experience the devastation created by a wicked student (played with chilling persuasion by Bonita Granville).Two fine character actresses now in danger of being forgotten have important supporting roles. Catherine Doucet plays Hopkins' silly, vindictive aunt, a vain woman completely capable of doing the wrong thing every time. Alma Kruger plays Granville's wealthy grandmother, proud &amp; patrician, she is seduced into doing much harm through her unwise love.In a small role, Walter Brennan is a joy as a rustic taxi driver. Marcia Mae Jones is quite compelling as a child struggling against enormous iniquity. Marvelous Margaret Hamilton, as Kruger's no-nonsense hatchet-faced housekeeper, gets to deliver one of cinema's most satisfying face slaps.Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Greta Meyer as a Viennese waitress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So powerful, it triumphed over prudery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw (the movie of) "The Children's Hour," and had also read the play long before seeing "These Three." So I approached this film, when I was finally able to see it, with trepidation. After all, I knew that Lillian Hellman's Broadway smash (which centers on an allegation of lesbianism) had been altered and softened for more middle-American audiences.Imagine my happy surprise to discover that the central conflict, the poison of a child's vindictive lie, remained compelling and believable even though the allegation was now pre-marital adultery instead of lesbian. When the play was filmed intact, again by William Wyler, the new movie had less to answer for to the original play than it did to this stunning early version.See the two movies side by side, and you'll see how prudery and fear of censorship can produce a work that triumphs over the bluenoses.I feel that "These Three" is in many ways the superior film. It is not as dark as "The Children," and only at the end does the lighter mood become suspect. It is also a more energetic film and feels less like a filmed stage play then "The Children's Hour" which treads the boards more theatrically, more obviously more stagily, and more talkily than it could every have been on stage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, beautifully acted film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"These Three" is an absorbing film that somehow manages to retain its integrity despite being different from the play, "The Children's Hour," on which it is based. Having seen the later film, "The Children's Hour," about two teachers accused of lesbianism, I wondered how the 1936 film would measure up. The answer: Brilliantly.Part of the reason for this is, as Lilliam Hellman, the playwright herself stated - the play isn't really about lesbianism, it's about a children's lie. And the vicious, destructive lie of a child is still central here, though now it concerns the supposed affair of Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrea, who is engaged to marry Merle Oberon, Hopkins' partner in a girls school. Another reason for the film's success is the flawless direction by William Wyler, and last but not least, a sympathetic trio. Hopkins is a standout with her strong, passionate performance.Bonita Granville, the bad seed, is such an evil, blackmailing brat, that I'm sure when 1936 audiences saw Margaret Hamilton slap her, they broke into applause. I nearly did, and I was watching it alone! It's an unrelenting performance, though she's such a walking horror show, it's remarkable anyone believed her in her "earnest" moments, which were calculated, as only a monster's can be! Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Version of the Hellman Play.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The power of a girl's lie is at the heart of the story involving two school teachers and one man.Lillian Hellman's THE CHILDREN'S HOUR was a play about lesbianism, reportedly based on an occurrence in a Scotland school in the 1800s in which two teachers were the focus of a rumor in which they were involved in a too-close-for-comfort affair, a scandal for the times. The fact that William Wyler in 1936 decided -- because of the Code's policies of the time -- to drop the lesbianism and instead opt for emphasizing the issue of gossip (regardless of what kind of gossip) as per one of the more malicious girls only emphasizes the themes of the movie version. And the fact that Oscar nominated Bonita Granville plays her sheer nastiness with so much relish only makes it the more disturbing when she resorts to blackmail to force Marcia Mae Jones (equally brilliant) to keep up with her lie, because even in the face of truth she will not let up, until of course she is humiliated by Agatha (played by the future Wicked Witch of the West, Margaret Hamilton) and will have to face the consequences of her actions.A great story that only vaguely hints at lesbian overtones, THESE THREE is very moving and for once Miriam Hopkins plays a truly likable character, as she was mainly known for having a rather icy presence. Her character thankfully does not kill herself as the play would have it, and her final scene as she walks out in triumph makes for a strong exit in the face of slander. Merle Oberon and Joel McCrea both acquit themselves in their roles though would be more known for future films, and overall, an intense movie-viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scottish Source</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1931 the noted Scots Criminologist, William Roughead, published a volume of his great essays on famous crimes entitled BAD COMPANIONS. One of the essays was called "The Great Drumshleugh Case". Set in Edinburgh in 1811 it told the story of two women running a school for society girls in the Scots capital, and how a malicious little girl spread a rumor that ruined them and the school. The little brat told everyone that the two women were secret lovers. The book was read by Lillian Hellman, who took the story and fashioned the story of her play, THE CHILDREN'S HOUR from it, only changing it to America and putting a man (a doctor) into the picture as the third part of the "triangle" in the child's lie.There have been two film versions of the story: this 1936 version (with Merle Oberon, Miriam Hopkins, and Joel McCrae) where the two women are made into heterosexuals, and a 1962 version (with Audrey Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine, and James Garner) where MacLaine admits that she did love Hepburn but commits suicide. The later version is closer to the Hellman play. In the play there is no "comeuppence scene", where the little brat gets hers. However, the scene where Margaret Hamilton slaps Bonita Granville is justifiably among the most satisfying "comeuppence scenes" in Hollywood film (ranking up there with George Sanders tearing into the lies of Anne Baxter in ALL ABOUT EVE). Indeed, the slap Ms Hamilton administers to Ms Granville makes up for anything the wicked Witch of the West tried to do to Dorothy Gail in THE WIZARD OF OZ.Although Mr. Roughead's essay is a good place to start one's study into the background of the incident (which, in 1811 was a possibly deadly one to be involved in - that same year, in England, two male homosexuals were executed for sodomy), a full length study was published in 1983 - SCOTCH VERDICT by Lillian Faderman. Ms Faderman does not excuse the young girl from her malicious attack, but she does produce some evidence that the two ladies may have been having an affair, and she shows that the young girl herself would end up being victimized by the publicity. The girl, Jane Cumming, was an illegitimate granddaughter to Lady Cumming Gordon, and her birth did not endear her to the grandmother or her family. Despised for that reason her attitude of defiance and dislike (leading to lashing out against her teachers) is partly understandable. But Jane Pirrie, one of the two teachers, brought a series of expensive legal actions against the grandmother, which ended in displaying ALL the dirty linen (including Jane Cumming's birth). As a result, when Lady Cumming Gordon finished paying the expenses (she lost the final case) Jane was even more disliked than before, and banished from contact with the family. Not a happy result at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling look at what a lie can do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"These Three" is an extremely effective look at the damage a lie can cause. Bonita Granville gives a tour-de-force performance as Mary Tilford, a vicious student who ruins the lives of her two schoolteachers (Merle Oberon and Miriam Hopkins) by telling a lie about their private lives. Based on a play by Lillian Hellman (whose original plot dealt with lesbianism, which was changed for the film version to get past the censors), "These Three" is still a very good film. Miriam Hopkins also stands out as one of the victimized teachers. All in all, one well-acted and well-directed drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Karen Wright (Merle Oberon) and Martha Dobie (Miriam Hopkins) are best friends since college. When they graduate, they decide to move to Lancet to the farm that Karen has inherited from her grandmother to build a boarding school for girls. On the arrival, they meet Dr. Joseph Cardin (Joel McCrea) and he helps them to restore the farmhouse working hard. One day Karen meets the influent Mrs. Amelia Tilford (Alma Kruger) that helps them to get students including her spoiled granddaughter Mary Tilford (Bonita Granville). Out of the blue, Martha's arrogant aunt Lily Mortar (Catharine Doucet) arrives at the school and offers to give classes. Meanwhile Joseph proposes Karen and they are engaged to each other.When the spiteful and compulsive liar Mary, who is a bad influence to the other girls, is punished by Karen after telling a lie, Martha has an argument with her snoopy aunt Lily in another room. Lily accuses Martha of being in love with Joseph and having encountered him in her room. Mary's roommate Rosalie Wells (Marcia Mae Jones) overhears the argument and tells Mary what Mrs. Mortar had said about her niece. The malicious Mary accuses Martha of being the lover of Joseph to her grandmother and Amelia spreads the gossip to the parents of the students that withdraw them from the school. Karen and Martha lose a lawsuit against Amelia and have their lives disrupted with the scandal. Further, Karen calls off her engagement with Joe since she is not sure that he is telling the truth. "These Three" is a cruel and heartbreaking story that shows how destructive the power of a lie may be. William Wyler is among my favorite directors and this film is a little gem with a magnificent screenplay. In 1961, he remade this movie changing the title to "The Children's Hour" and using the theme of lesbianism instead of a triangle of love, and a tragic ending. Both movies are worthwhile watching and it is hard to pointy out which version is the better. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Infâmia 1936" ("Infamy 1936")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen "The Children's Hour" with Shirley MacLaine, Audrey Hepburn and James Garner a couple of times, and I realize that it is truer to the original play and had a definite shock value in 1961. But "These Three" is far more engaging. Miriam Hopkins (generally not one of my favorites), Merle Oberon and McCrae are far more appealing and the performances of Bonita Granville and Marcia Mae Jones are among the best child performances I've ever seen. Granville, who was also good as Bette Davis' thoughtless niece in "Now, Voyager" a few years later, makes a better young villainess than Patricia McCormack in "The Bad Seed."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different 30's Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew nothing about this movie until it came on at 5:00 am the other morning. I had no idea that it was a William Wyler film. It seemed a little slow in starting and usually if I'm not intrigued in the first 30 minutes, I'll change the channel. But then I became intrigued. Things started happening and all the charters seemed to jell. The screaming and yelling of the children was like chalk on a blackboard at first. Then I understood the brilliance of it, you were supposed to react that way (as we do in real life.) No one likes to hear a child cry. But they do, and that's one of the things that makes this film real. Great acting by the two main child actors (Bonita Granville as the loathed Mary Tilford and Marcia Mae Jones with a breathtaking role as the troubled Rosalie Wells.) ***Possible Spoiler*** It wasn't until bratty Mary was slapped by Mrs. Tilford's maid, (in a small roll, who would soon become an icon as the "Wicked Witch of the West") the fabulous Margaret Hamilton. At that moment I knew I had indeed seen this film as a child, and remember people cheering that slap. Quite a powerful moment that must have made an impression on me. If you're a William Wyler fan, this is a film you should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's the secret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Semi-spoiler below)There is one reason why this "sham" is better than the more literal 1962 remake of "The Children's Hour": Lillian Hellman. At least producer Sam Goldwyn had the taste and foresight to hire her to bowdlerize her own story! Perhaps sensing a potential disaster, Hellman reached deep inside for a do-over that would preserve the integrity of her play. She succeeded in part by playing up the romantic tension to the hilt against the morals of the day. Although "These Three" is as heterosexual as it gets, its details are quite sordid according to its dated upper-middle-class standards. The adult performances are fine; Miriam Hopkins is indeed the best, but director William Wyler even makes a solid performance of Merle Oberon's haughty reserve. Here, it only reinforces the taboo proceedings.Hellman really shines in her reconception of the evil child, one of the most disturbing, if infrequent characters in the history of storytelling. She does so more unflinchingly than Hollywood would again attempt until the (inferior) "The Bad Seed" (1956). Hellman makes the bargain foolproof by way of a unique pathology: the worse things get for Bonita Granville's character, the smoother and more damaging are her lies. This is her unforgettable talent. "These Three" is not quite a great movie; it's an excellent filming of a stage play. Still, as played by Bonita Granville, Hellman presents one of the most brilliant characters I've ever seen on the silver screen. Can you imagine how much better so many movies would have been with such simple yet ingenious insurance against plot holes?Of course, extraordinary directing and acting are needed to make such a gambit pay off. Wyler and young Bonita deliver, as others have stated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This adaptation of Hellman's play Children's Hour, is even more censored than the Hepburn/ Maclaine/ Garner starrer with changed plot points (changing the homosexual attraction to a regular straight crush as well as the ending) but both and the quality of the acting and the film itself, which is well paced, energetic and not stagy, is massively better than the newer version.Two young women straight out of university fix up a house inherited by one of them to start up a girl's prep school. The pert and deadly dull Merle Oberon hooks up with local hunk surgeon and beekeeper played by Joel McCrea, whilst an excellent Miriam Hopkins observes with simmering heterosexual jealousy. An argument with her aunt regarding her attraction to McCrea is misinterpreted by resident conniving brat (spectacularly performed with enthusiastically malicious fervour by Bonita Granville). Hopkins is falsely accused by the scheming student of soliciting pre-marital adultery by means of a noisy, illicit romp on school grounds with her best friend's fiancée, and the future of their school in placed in jeopardy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tribute to Wyler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film that opened in 1936, "These Three" manages to hold the attention seventy years later. True, Lillian Helmann's heterosexual adaptation may seem a bit over-baked now; still, there are some compelling scenes which are touching.Working with a top-notch cast and crew, Director William Wyler managed to coax some pretty heartfelt performances from his ensemble. The whole thing looks like it may have been an extremely difficult shoot, especially for its principals. Word has it that Miriam Hopkins was very difficult to work with, and that Merle Oberon's normally meager talent was stretched beyond its capacity by the demanding director. Yet, through probably endless retakes, the final result from the editing room is impressive. The child actors are quite good, without which the drama's effectiveness would have been considerably lessened. All the adult performers are strong, rendering commendable work.Judging from the viewer's and critic's evaluation on IMDb, "These Three" is still very much appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Child Acting in Film, Hands Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comment may contain general spoilers.I swear this has to be the BEST child acting i've ever seen in a classic film in years, and i watch so many classics it's ridiculous. Sure, Mickey Rooney was a capable actor but sometimes I feel he IS acting. With the children in These Three, I was dumbstruck. William Wyler had his hands full w/ child actors in this film and Kudos w/ a capital K to Bill for pulling the best out of everyone.Bonita Granville as Mary Tilford does a mind-blowing job grasping a tremendously dramatic role and she did it so believably and without force that her blackmailing threat to Rosalie and the confrontation scene w/ grandmother, and bulk of cast, I got goosebumps. She carried the part very much like Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage in her famous "wipe my mouth" scene. She did the scene so delicately, so conniving, with such convincing facial expressions and tonal inflections that I was spellbound. Marcia Jones as Rosalie was quite good herself to the point it makes me wonder what the poor girl was threatened with before the scene was shot.I must say, too, that it is great to see Merle Oberon using her face in a way that doesn't make her look demented such as in Wuthering Heights. It was great to see her more natural, less possessed looking w/ her eyes. In this movie, she definitely was reeled in quite a bit and i credit Wyler for that. Miriam Hopkins was as beautiful, soulful and sad as ever.Overall, I believe the child actor Bonita Granville stole the entire film, but I could feel Marcia's fear of her secret being discovered and punishment to ensue. I could feel Miriam's longing and Merle's calm sense of decency. As I said before, William Wyler managed to get performances that were spot on for the film, keeping the tone, believability and atmosphere as convincing as films of the 30s could be.The cinematography was done very well, and Gregg Toland, who had his life cut short at 44, was very much a master of lighting and unique camera angles. A feeling of intimacy was established in a lot of the scenes in ways I can say I've never seen shot before. The 3 leads, standing in Ms. Tilford's living room on the day they go to find out what the issue is, standing side by side, and Toland puts the camera behind them. That little subtle angle conveyed so much emotionally that i'm surprised it wasn't mimicked over and over by every DP worldwide. He went on to DP such greats as Intermezzo, Citizen Kane, Little Foxes, and more, where his influential yet extremely subtle camera and lighting from These Three was turned on it's head, showing his extreme versatility.This is a great film, especially for it's era. I'm a harsh critic, so I give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hellman's brilliance as a writer shines through ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone told Sam Goldwyn that he had to be crazy to buy the film rights to this one. At the time (1930s), the lesbian theme of the play would have made a film version impossible to release. But, Goldwyn and Lillian Hellman came up with a version that kept intact the other central theme (the vicious lie told by Mary Tilford, the young girl played by Bonita Granville and the resulting damage to "These Three" lives). Of interest to trivia buffs is the fact that Miriam Hopkins (known by many as a "difficult" actress in her Hollywood years), who played Martha in this version, was brought back to play Martha's aunt (Lily Mortar) in the later (1960s) William Wyler version, which reverted to the original title of THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, and starred Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine. That version also was graced by the brilliant performance of Fay Bainter, who played Mary Tilford's grandmother. Watch her especially closely as she exits, after making her (rejected)apology and offer of restitution. Want a real treat? Read Hellman's script for the Broadway play ... and then watch both film versions, in either order.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The relationship between censorship and creativity can be summed up no better than in "The Producers," when Gene Wilder is going insane and Zero Mostel throws the bucket of water on Wilder to calm him down, only to make Wilder more insane. "These Three," based on a play by Lillian Hellman (who also wrote the screenplay), is the story of two debutantes, Karen Wright and Martha Dobie, (Merle Oberon and Miriam Hopkins) fresh out of school who--almost immediately--inexplicably decide to start their own school (studies do say the public school system is built to churn out teachers). At the building where the two women wish to house their school, they meet Joe Cardin (Joel McCrea) who assists them in their endeavor. He makes three. They all become great friends, open the school to resounding success and everything is just hunky-dory.As usually happens, children ruin everything--in this case, one child: Mary (Bonita Granville). To understand Mary, one must simply imagine Iago as a young girl--afraid? Mary, because she's spiteful, young and doesn't understand consequences, spreads a lie about her teachers in order to take the attention away from her own misbehavior. So what is initially a private, mild, unacted-on love triangle--that probably would never have amounted to anything and fizzled away with time--becomes the business of the entire town.The original play had Mary's lie alluding to a lesbian relationship between the two friends; however, due to that pesky Hays Code, McCrea's character was conceived, and the lie turned into one of heterosexual deviance, though even that is tiptoed around. Despite the changes to the source material, the film never feels watered down, as the contents of the lie really aren't that important, at least not as much as the subsequent reverberations. Plus, by not mentioning specifics, it almost makes the whole thing more potent, as the viewer's imagination is given free rein. The example often referred to in is from "Shane," and the intense sexual tension between the titular character and the boy's mother, despite never showing anything. In this way, censorship becomes creativity's unlikely accomplice. As weighty as the film is, it's surprisingly funny. In particular, Martha's aunt, Lily Mortar, (Catherine Doucet), who is a haughty, loquacious, former actress. She reminded me of one of Dickens' over- the-top aristocratic characters. When a taxi driver (played by Walter Brennan, who, I guess, got tired of driving stagecoaches) requests his pay, Mortar merely chides him on his obsession with money.William Wyler's "These Three" is an excellent adult drama that hasn't aged a bit (well, maybe a little bit). Not a single performance fails to impress--particular Granville's as Mary, a tough part for a child actor--and the comedy--which is a gamble in a dramatic film, for it runs the risk of deflating the whole thing-- feels completely natural. Few films I've seen handle the concept of mob mentality better than this one. My one gripe--and I had this with the recent "The Hunt"--is who are these adults that take everything a child says as indisputable fact? Use your brain.Lastly, how cool is that poster?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ill effects of gossip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure that Lillian Hellman when she sold the screen rights for The Children's Hour she had to know that her play about lesbianism would be totally changed by Hollywood. The Code was firmly in place now and even a subject that might be just hinted at would be forbidden now. For the three decades homosexuality could at most be discreetly hinted at.Bearing that in mind These Three now changed to be just a heterosexual triangle with Merle Oberon, Joel McCrea, and Miriam Hopkins was a decent drama about the ill effects of gossip. And the gossiper received an Oscar nomination.Oberon and Hopkins are teachers at a girl's school and Oberon is keeping company with Doctor Joel McCrea. But one night quite innocently McCrea is seen with Hopkins where they live by one of the girls. Bonita Granville had been chastised earlier on so now the evil little teen starts some gossip and as a result These Three have to defend themselves against something non-existent. That's usually the worst thing you ever have to defend yourself against, something totally made up.William Wyler directed this one with sensitivity and taste. And he lived long enough to direct the real version of The Children's Hour in the Sixties. Miriam Hopkins appears in both in different roles.Bonita Granville got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the first year Supporting players were categories. But she lost to Gale Sondergaard playing a wicked adult in Anthony Adverse.It's a good film but not as good as The Children's Hour. How could it be?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of Lillian Hellman's play ("passed by the Board of National Review") is full of anguish, malice, self torture, heartbreak, stupidity, unrequited love, economic ruin, utter misery, and has a happy ending.It's filled with stereotypes. There are the two young ladies, eager to establish a boarding school for girls, though they must start with virtually nothing. There is the doctor who is also handy around the house and lends them his aid. The zymic, lying brat who dominates everyone around her through falsehoods and manipulation. The bubble-headed, hystrionic auntie who lives in the school, never stops talking, and gets everyone in trouble, only to disappear when she has a chance to rectify matters. The haughty aristocrat who is the catalyst of doom.The best role is that of the spoiled brat, Bonita Granville. Boy, is she mean. Of course she overacts, but then everyone overacts except maybe Joel McCrea as the doctor, who is his usual pleasant but earnest self throughout.I was interested in seeing how a movie made in 1936 would handle the lesbian subtext of the play. It does so rather neatly. Instead of two dykes making out, Bonita Granville claims she peeked through a key hole and saw Miriam Hopkins getting it on with McCrea, the fiancé of Merle Oberon. Shocking enough, I suppose, at the time.But Hellman's story is almost as manipulative and goal-oriented as Bonita Granville's brat. The stupidity runs riot throughout the script. A story that could avoid a calamity with a frank five-minute conversation, avoids the conversation instead. A remorseful old lady who begs forgiveness from the offended trio, is repulsed with a sneer and a curse. Everyone deserts everyone else for reasons that it would take second sight to discern.Still, the story was a shocker in its time and I can enjoy seeing these formulaic elements unreeled. There's something reassuring about a vision of life that sees nothing in it but rot -- and yet ends with two lovers in a clinch while triumphant music swells in the background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two friends (Miriam Hopkins and Merle Oberon) open up a school to teach young girls. Along the way Oberon falls for a handsome young doctor (a ridiculously pretty Joel McCrea). Unfortunately there's an evil young woman in school (Bonita Granville) who spreads a lie saying that Hopkins and McCrea are lovers behind Oberon's back...and their lives are destroyed.Cleaned up version of "The Children's Hour" by Lillian Hellman. In the original play the two women were accused being lesbians...but that couldn't be done on the screen in 1936 so they turn it into a love triangle. The play was filmed faithfully in 1962 by the same director. Still this movie is very good on its own. The dialogue is almost identical to the play with minor changes. The acting is great, it moves very quickly, McCrea is impossibly handsome and it just draws you in. Well-directed too. The 1962 version (under "The Children's Hour" title) is good too but this is well worth seeing. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"These Three" is taken from the play "The Children's Hour" and follows two friends, Martha (Miriam Hopkins) and Karen (Merle Oberon), who graduate from college and go to and old farm Karen's family owns and fix it up, with intentions of making it a school for young ladies. They meet, Joe Carden (Joel McCrea), a handsome doctor, and he falls in love with Karen, but Martha also falls for him, but it is unrequited. Joe and Karen eventually get engaged. The women open up their school, and with the help of Martha's gossipy Aunt Lily (Catherine Doucet), it become a success. There is however a ghastly little girl at the school named Mary Tilford, played eerily by Bonita Granville, who proves to be a problem when she formulates a lie about Martha and Joe, and it spirals out of control. The play the film was based on featured a rumor about lesbianism, but in 1936, with the Hays Code in full affect, that could not be done, so the play's author wrote this script instead. The changing of the rumor does not effect the message of the story, but the film would not have been what it was, had it not been for it's stellar cast. Alma Kruger is a strong presence as Mary Tilford's grandmother, and you really feel for her character by the end. Walter Brennan and Margaret Hamilton round out the cast in small roles, Brennan as a comic relief cab driver, and Hamilton as the maid at the Tilford home. Hopkins, Oberon, and McCrea all turn in wonderful performances, but it is Granville and young Marcia Mae Jones as the other main young girl, Rosalie, who truly hold their own with the pros. Granville, who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, was only 13, and Jones only 12 when production transpired on "These Three" and their performances are very impressive.The film does a fairly good job of not being melodramatic. There are some schmaltzy lines here and there, but for the most part it it a gripping and well acted drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of 2 great versions of this story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1934, Lillian Hellman wrote "The Children's Hour" as a stage play. Two years later it was decided to make the story into a film...but there were 2 problems in doing so, both related to the moral standards allowed in film at that time -- lesbianism and suicide.And so, today, one has 2 great choices -- this film or "The Children's' Hour".In this film, the 2 most controversial topics are sanitized. There is no suicide...the character just goes away. There is no lesbianism, instead, that theme is replaced by a heterosexual triangle.In "The Children's' Hour", the lesbianism is central to the plot, and one main character does commit suicide.In both films, the leading players are excellent. Here, the 2 female leads are superb -- Miriam Hopkins and Merle Oberon. In fact, their performances here are among the best, if not the best, of their respective careers. The male lead here is Joel McCrea, before his switch to almost all Westerns, and he is excellent, as well, although there are other films where he is even better. In "The Children's Hour" the female leads are Shirley MacLaine and Audrey Hepburn, and they are just as superb, thought it's over 2 decades later. The male lead in "The Children's' Hour" is James Garner, in one of his better roles.If one film is better than the other, my vote would go to "The Children's' Hour", and I would say because of the strength of the supporting players. In this film, Alma Kruger is really fine as the grandmother of the girl brat who spreads evil rumors. But, her performance is eclipsed by a stunning performance by Fay Bainter. Similarly, the brat here is played by Bonita Granville, while a better performance is turned in by Karen Balkin.One of the most interesting factors in comparing this film and "The Children's' Hour" is that where Miriam Hopkins is one of the female leads in this film, in the latter film she plays the part of the aunt and aging actress (which in this film is played by Catherine Doucet. Miriam Hopkins's film career suffered greatly in later years, but in this film she was in full tilt.I really encourage every lover of film to view both versions of the story. Both are excellent and worth a spot on your DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of both Granville's and Jones' performances is extraordinary!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "these three" of the title is a pretty mundane triangle with only Miriam Hopkins excelling as the sensitive Martha, caught up in a love affair between her dear friend Karen (Merle Oberon) and husky he-man, Dr. Cardin (Joel McCrea). What this film is remembered for are the spellbinding performances of the two young girls. Psychotic Mary Tilford was played by Bonita Granville who had been around since the early 30s, playing in films like "Silver Dollar" and "Cavalcade" (1933). Nothing prepared anyone for her knockout performance as Mary Tilford, a school yard bully supreme, who rules the weaker Rosalie (Marcia Mae Jones) through fear and intimidation. If anything Jones' portrayal is even more dynamic, as her Rosalie is pushed to the breaking point by being forced to betray a teacher she loves.Karen and Martha, friends and graduates of the same class, plan to set up a school in an old farm house that Karen has inherited. On their first day they meet charming Dr. Cardin and he is instantly attracted to Karen - shy Martha is also drawn to him. They also meet Mrs. Tilford, the most influential woman in the village - she is bringing her grand- daughter, Mary home from school (has she been expelled???) and suggests her as a pupil for their school. Mary becomes the school cheat and bully, singling out sweet Rosalie for her vicious attacks. Mary is fed up with what she feels is unfair treatment and runs away. She concocts a lie about the two teachers and Dr. Cardin and she tells her grandmother so she won't have to go back. The lie gets out of hand as Mrs Tilford is horrified and spreads the news around the town - suddenly parents are withdrawing their children from school and Karen and Martha don't know why!!! To clear their name they issue Mrs Tilford with a libel suit but, unfortunately, Mary is blackmailing Rosalie over the alleged theft of a missing bracelet, so she backs Mary's story and the teachers lose their case!!The power of both the children's performances is extraordinary. Marcia Mae Jones' Rosalie more than matches Bonita Granvilles' Mary in intensity and passion. By the end of the thirties Granville's roles were a far cry from Mary Tilford and she is remembered today for starring in a series built around that all American girl detective Nancy Drew. Marcia Mae Jones, who had been acting since she was a baby (her first role was as a baby in Dolores Costello's "Mannequin"(1926)) played memorable parts in 2 Shirley Temple movies (Klara in "Heidi" (1938) and a particularly horrible schoolgirl in "The Little Princess" (1939)) but nothing else of note. I think Miriam Hopkins portrayal of inhibited Martha is streets ahead of Merle Oberon' bland Karen but when the film was released they both received equal praise. Samuel Goldwyn, who thought this film would provide Miriam with the breakout role she needed, lost interest in her after this.Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This engaging, often very powerful drama was director William Wyler's first big success. While Lilian Helman's controversial play "The Children's Hour" was censored of lesbian themes due to the Production Code, and made into a triangle drama of two women in love with the one man, this is still a marvellous adaptation. It's a compelling, frightening look at how lies and suspicion can ruin several lives. The three leads are Miriam Hopkins, Merle Oberon and Joel McCrea. Oberon was never much of an actress but she was usually passable enough on screen, and here she outdoes herself, thanks to a good director and meaty material. McCrea is her fiancé that she suspects is having an affair with Hopkins, and he too turns in solid work. Hopkins gives a subtle performance that rises to a fever pitch as the accusations fly. However, it's Bonita Granville's poisonous schoolgirl who tells the lie who is truly unforgettable. Her Mary is surely one of the most spiteful little creatures ever put on screen. When Margaret Hamilton slaps her, I bet everyone would applaud! And this is from an actress who was best known as The Wicked Witch Of The West! Wyler worked with cinematographer Gregg Toland in this film as he would in the later "Wuthering Heights", "The Little Foxes" and "The Best Years Of Our Lives", and it's fair to say they work dramatic magic together. Toland was developing his famed deep-focus here, and the "triangle composition" within the shot works very well. Overall, there's not much to fault. It takes a little while to get into it though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Lies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THESE THREE (Samuel Goldwyn/United Artists, 1936), directed by William Wyler, based on "The Children's Hour" (1934) by Lillian Hellman, who also scripted the original story and screenplay, is a powerful drama expertly transferred to the screen with a timely message on how a spiteful teenager's lies can virtually destroy the lives and reputations of innocent people. Being more like something commonly depicted in 1950s cinema such as THE BAD SEED (1956) for example, THESE THREE can be categorized as ahead of its time.The story revolves around best friends Martha Dobie (Miriam Hopkins) and Karen Wright (Merle Oberon), first presented as classmates graduating from college. While Karen has no living relatives, Martha has her meddlesome aunt, Lily Mortar (Catherine Doucet), a former actress who theatrical manner gets on her nerves. Following their ceremony, the girls decide to work together as teachers by forming their very own school. Taking an old abandoned farm house in Lancet, Massachusetts, Karen has inherited by her late grandmother, they, with the help of Joseph Cardin (Joel McCrea), their neighboring doctor, beekeeper and handyman, help turn a run down building into an established Wright and Dolbie School. The teachers successfully acquire the much needed students to get themselves established. All goes well until Mary Tilford (Bonita Granville), a mischievous child of a rich aunt (Alma Kruger) creates trouble for those around her. Aside from stealing a bracelet belonging to Helen Burton (Mary Louise Cooper) and placing the blame on the innocent Rosalie Welles (Marcia Mae Jones), she fakes heart attacks so not to be punished for her actions, though both Karen and Martha through her as a compulsive lier who needs help and strict discipline. Hearing rumors involving "these three" are enough for Mary to avenge herself on them by stretching the truth out of proportion to her aunt, forcing Rosalie to back up her statements. With Martha and Karen finding their pupils being taken out of school, and the doctor losing his position in the hospital, "these three" join forces in a courtroom battle, to only find their lives and reputations ruined beyond repair.While the screen adaptation substitutes a romantic triangle over its original premise of Martha and Karen as suspected lesbians from the stage play, the film retains its powerful impact thanks to William Wyler's direction. When Wyler directed its remake, THE CHILDREN'S HOUR (1961) starring Audrey Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine and James Garner (along with Miriam Hopkins in the Doucet role), the story was not only brought up to date, but the lesbian theme retained. Comparing both versions, the original is no doubt the best of these two. Although the remake is well acted by the leading players, THE CHILDREN'S HOUR comes off as dreary, depressing and weakened by the lackluster performances by the children, especially Karen Balkin whose tantrums and outbursts can't parallel towards Granville's Academy Award nominated (supporting category) performance as the spiteful Mary Tilford. Before Granville played the lovable teenage sleuth Nancy Drew in four installments for Warner Brothers (1938-39), and other notable roles through her adulthood, she did a similar Mary Tilford portrayal in MAID OF SALEM (Paramount, 1937) as a vengeful girl whose spiteful lies lead to a Salem witch hunt. She proves herself a fine, intense young actress, especially when her motionless eyes show no remorse for her actions.Considering Hopkins and Oberon as possible contenders as Academy Award nominees, Hopkins is most notable as the stronger of the two due to her forceful performance. Aside from keeping her emotions to herself over the man she loves, her heated arguments with her aunt, after refusing to testify for her in court, are realistically done. It seems interesting how the script constantly substitutes "Be still" for either "Be quiet" or "Shut up!" While Hopkins, Oberon and McCrea are the only actors with their names presented in the opening credits, the supporting players, consisting of Walter Brennan who provides the film's lighter moments as a taxi driver who charges a dollar a mile; and Margaret Hamilton as Agatha, the Tilford Maid, in a brief but striking performance with the unruly child, are given the credit they deserve along with other members of the cast. The closing credits does not exist in the old 1986 VHS recording, though available in TV prints. Aside from presentations on commercial TV prior to 1990s, THESE THREE did have exposure on cable television throughout the years, ranging from Turner Network Television (1991-92); American Movie Classics (1992-1993); and Turner Classic Movies (2003-2005).In closing, THESE THREE is another great movie from the Samuel Goldwyn archives. Nothing in this 93 minute presentation drags and no scenes unnecessary. (****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a tendency ,unlike the other users,to like the remake best (made by Wyler too) .Probably because Lilian Hellman's play included hints at lesbianism,a subject which could not be treated in the thirties ,when Wyler was one of the specialists of the female melodrama.That's why I think that the 1963 movie was more exciting ,and still is ,still in 2007.I'm not sure that all the parents would accept a gay teacher ,but a ménage ? trois has lost its scandalous side.However "these three" is another Wyler's must,well acted by Merle Oberon ,Joel McCrea and Miriam Hopkins ,the latter being my favorite .Wyler is a master when it comes to tell a story.His depiction of the tiny school,of the manor are lovely.Maybe the horrid child overplays a bit -she is more convincing in the remake- but her young pal ,being blackmailed and afraid of being sent to a reform school ,is a good young actress.The scene when the two women meet McCrea for the first time is charming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the changes to Miss Hellman's play, the movie is grand!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Lillian Hellman's original play, THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, the scandal involved lesbianism--certainly NOT a topic they were allowed to address in Hollywood in the strengthened Production Code era. Starting around 1935, Hollywood bowed to pressure to clean up the movies and feature more wholesome images. While today some see this as a totally negative thing, you must understand that nudity, violence, crudeness and very adult topics were frequently used in films and there was no rating system. So, kids might go to the theaters and see rather graphic nude swimming scenes (TARZAN AND HIS MATE and BIRD OF PARADISE are good examples) or Frank McHugh giving someone "the finger" (PARATROOPER). As a result, SOME sort of system needed to be created, though I will admit some of the resulting products from Hollywood were a bit bland. In regard to THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, there was no way the studios would be allowed to discuss homosexuality during this era, so they changed the allegations to promiscuity between a man and a woman. This did NOT appreciably alter the play nor its impact and reportedly Miss Hellman was happy with the film despite this minor change--minor in that it resulted in only minor alterations to the script and kept the overall message intact.The resulting film, THESE THREE, was produced by David O. Selznick, directed by William Wyler and starred Miriam Hopkins, Merle Oberon and Joel McCrea. With this terrific combination of talents and the Hellman script, it certainly isn't much of a surprise that the film was excellent throughout--and one of the better pictures of the 1930s. About the only negative at all about the play was the performance of young Bonita Granville. While generally very good (earning her an Oscar nomination), it was at times also a tad over-the-top--and she acted so histrionic that you wonder what sane person would believe all of her lies!!! If this had been toned down just a bit (making her a little more subtle), the film would have earned a 10. As it is, it's still a terrific film with an original and wonderful script.</fullReview>

Now the school has shut down and the teachers face some hefty fines all because of this nasty little rich girl. The ending is what took my breath away most of all. Margaret Hamilton(The Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz)plays the little girl's grandmother's maid. When the grandmother realizes Mary has been lying all along she tells the maid(Hamilton) to send her up to her room. The little brat gets feisty with the maid, or at least TRYS to, and regrets it. Hamilton delivers one of the worlds most painful face slaps in the history of film. When she slapped Mary I couldn't help but cringe. There was NO sound effect and there was NOTHING fake about that face slap. It was genuine and REAL!! Another reason no one should ever mess with that woman. Even Dorothy knew she couldn't mess with her. But this movie was great. The young girl who plays Mary does an excellent job and I must say deserved an award. She was really convincing in her role and so was everyone else.</fullReview>

This version stars Merle Oberon and Miriam Hopkins as friends who open a school for young girls. Joel McCrea is a local doctor who loves Oberon and they get engaged but Hopkins loves him too and they don't know. Bonita Granville is a spoiled brat at the school who hates to be punished so she decides to get back at Oberon and Hopkins. Granville finds out Hopkins loves McCrea and she starts a rumor that Hopkins slept with McCrea and everyone finds out and takes their kids out of the school. In this version they leave out the part about them being lesbians like they had in the remake and this version has a much more upbeat ending then the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know.............as much as I love movies from the 30s and the 40s (and even some of the early talkies from the late 20s), I was disappointed in this film, after seeing the Audrey Hepburn/Shirley McLaine version, which came out 25 years later. Much of the acting was not very good, compared to the fine talent in "The Children's Hour"; especially in the case of Miriam Hopkins, who played Martha, and the actresses who played Martha's aunt and Mrs. Tilford (the grandmother who believed Mary Tilford's lie). Of these three actresses, the worst was the aunt. The best of these was the elderly lady who played Grandmother Tilford (so I'll admit, she was somewhat gifted). Actually, it wasn't so much that these actresses were so bad; it was just that their counterparts, in "The Children's Hour" were so great. I have no qualms with the 1936 version changing the theme from lesbianism to a heterosexual love triangle. Had the acting been outstanding (or better than the 1961 film), that would not have fazed me one bit.</fullReview>
