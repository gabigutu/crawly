		<shortDescription>Ripe for re-release!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A 'classic' film, (whatever that may be), can almost never be re-made in quite the same way again. It's something that we've thought about for quite a while, though - and noted filmmakers (including Gus Van Sant and Sydney Pollack) have tried and failed to re-make films to jazz up their appeal, and make them more accessible to a wider audience. It's something that passed through my mind quite a few times as I watched "The Children's Hour" today. Quite clearly, this is a film that more people deserve to see and know about, and it would certainly be interesting to try and re-make it, but we would definitely lose something in the translation.The largest reason for this is because it is a film of a definite period - the issues raised in the film are widely discussed these days, whereas in the period the film was set, homosexuality was something to be feared and despised. Similarly, we do not have the various elaborate codes of honour that are so prevalent in the film, and dictate the actions of almost all characters. It's a pity, then, that this film will be alien to lots of people today. The answer, however, is not in a re-make (the film is itself a re-make of a 1936 film by the same director called "These Three", and an adaptation of a play of the same name by Lillian Hellman), but a re-release of this fine example of moviemaking.Boasting a terrific cast including Audrey Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine and James Garner, "The Children's Hour" is the story of two teachers, Miss Dobie and Miss Wright, who found a school for young girls in an idyllic town in America. Then, out of boredom, spite and plain maliciousness, a child tells a vicious lie that will bring about the downfall of the school, the teachers, and all caught up in the horrible set of affairs. It is quite possible to see the creeping evil and hatred that stems from Mary, the child concerned (played wonderfully by Karen Balkin). Eventually, it reaches out and destroys all it touches.The photography is great (it was nominated for an Oscar) - there are many scenes which are so wonderfully composed that each frame paints a thousand words: the climax of the movie is a great example. The relationship between MacLaine and Hepburn is delicately and sensitively portrayed, especially for a cast who didn't know what they were doing (according to MacLaine in an interview for "The Celluloid Closet"). James Garner is also good in his role as the doctor about to marry Hepburn, although the movie is clearly not aimed at giving him the best lines. There are also many, many superb supporting roles - and the film's strength comes from a great ensemble performance.It doesn't really matter what the child accuses the teachers of (indeed we only find out a good hour into the film, although it has been strongly implied), because the film isn't really about homosexuality. As MacLaine points out in "The Celluloid Closet" (a cracking documentary about the history of homosexuality in the movies), it is about "a child's accusation". It is also about the power held by a town to bring about the downfall of two perfectly nice, perfectly ordinary young people. The are lines in the film that one should never forget and it should also make us think about the way our words shape the situations in which we live: ("unnatural" is a great example).All in all, a lovely film from director William Wyler ("Ben-Hur", "Roman Holiday", "Funny Girl"), and one that deserves to be seen by a wider audience - re-release, please!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very intriguing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched "The Children's Hour" for the first time this evening. I must say that I was very impressed. Hepburn and MacLaine gave brilliant performances as the two headmistresses of a girl's school. The cinema photography was outstanding and the direction and writing were fantastic.Turner Classic Movies ran this gorgeous film this evening and the comments that were made after the run brought several thoughts to mind. After viewing the movie, I decided to get on-line and see what others had to say about this film.The one comment that was made tonight was that it was thought that the film didn't really `appeal' to the heightened sensibility of the audiences of the 60's. However, I felt that the movie was timeless in its observations and portrayals of its two main characters. Grant it, homosexuality was NOT the main focus of this movie but it does play a very important, albeit, small role.In today's society, homosexuality is more widely accepted than it was at the time this play was written. However, there is one area in society that it is still 'taboo' to be gay and that is in the teaching profession. There are STILL, more than 40 years after this movie was made, teachers that cannot be who they really are for fear of losing their jobs, the respect of their peers and the trust of parents. Grant it this is not in every part of the country, in every town, but it is still as thus in small-town America. I know this for fact, as I am the life-partner of a teacher. I know what it is like for him to have to hide who he really is and the torture that he goes through because of it. Children can say some very vicious things and I have seen what it can do to a person first-hand. This is why I feel that this picture is very 'true to life'; because in so many ways this is still the way things are today.Indeed, more people should see this movie! Maybe people would think before spreading rumors. This is a prime example of what one comment can do to a person's life and how it can snowball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Tale Of Ruined Lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are spoilers in this review.What a dark, brilliant film. Audrey Hepburn, Shirley Maclaine, and James Garner are absolutely wonderful in this timeless gem of a movie. The immutable power of a child's false witness is seldom portrayed better than in this film. History has shown that just a few impressionable adults and one vengeful child can produce a mountain of misery: for example, witness the abominations of the Salem witch trials or the Wenatchee, Washington child sex ring.Karen Balkin is absolutely perfect in the role of Mary Tilford, the vicious little rich girl who easily puts Patricia McCormack from `The Bad Seed' to shame as she falsely accuses her teachers of having a lesbian relationship. She ruins several lives with her deceit, breaks up an engagement, shuts down a school, and destroys the loving bond of her family. It is wrenching to watch the desolation that ensues because of her bald-faced dishonesty: yokels stop in front of the abandoned school and point and stare, a delivery boy smirks at them, and the whole town turns their backs on them. The end of this film is unutterably sad and poignant; Maclaine, the best actor in the group, wrings every last bit of pathos from her character, and the devastation is unapologetically crystal-clear.The unfairness of life and its attendant majority group of people who readily accept easily-believed lies was never made more lucid than in this film. The sad thing is that this sort of thing goes on every day, all over the world, which makes this film a cautionary tale about judging your neighbor too quickly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A child's lie destroys lives, a parable for the present</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this remarkable film, a child's malicious lie destroys the lives of two young teachers. The child lies to avoid school because "everyone there hates me." The lie is believed because it is compounded by idle ramblings. Then it is upheld by a girl who is lying only to protect herself. This piece plays remarkably well today as it shows that children do lie even when they don't really know what they are talking about. Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine are remarkable in this work as they show the emotional upheaval that a simple lie can cause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Know Thyself - Not An Easy Task</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2007 in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia, a male teacher with seniority was politely asked to resign by the high school where he had worked for several years because his personal website (where his name did not even appear) contained suggestive photos of himself and his lover; it was somehow found and reported on to the principal. So you see, the premise of "The Children's Hour" is not at all out-of-date!What is absolutely fascinating about this film, and what makes it unique in all the dramas which have been made on the subject of homosexuality, is the treatment of the road of self-discovery taken by these two very different women.MacLaine wants Hepburn to buy some new clothes in an early scene, because she remembers how stylish her friend liked to be in her university days, and she even shares the memory of her first sight of Hepburn, when she said to herself, "What a pretty girl!" By the time the action of this movie begins, these two women have already lived and worked together for at least ten years. There was university together. Then, they both started teaching and accumulated several years' worth of experience; and it must certainly have taken a while to save up the money to set up the private girls' school of their dreams. That is a long relationship, a very committed relationship. Many similar career women in the 1960's, back to the 1870's (!) - famous women novelists, scientists, musicians, artists, poets - are now casually described in academia as lesbians, if they had any kind of a lengthy partnership with another woman at all. It has become a fashionable, politically correct label. But are these labels accurate?Years ago, a sisterly friendship was accepted as just that. Now some kind of sex act is required and assumed. Nobody is supposed to be able to exist without regular orgasms. Nonsense! The culture has turned us all into Pavlovian dogs who salivate on cue. It is not true that 'everybody is doing it.' It wasn't true in past generations, and it isn't even true today.The women in "The Children's Hour" were not 'doing it' either. But the movie is thrilling because it is not concerned with the spasms of body parts, but with the deep things of the heart.MacLaine adored Hepburn, and always had. Hepburn was surely conscious, at some level all those years, of that adoration. Every lasting friendship between two people has unspoken dynamics, reasons why the individuals relate strongly to one another, key roles they play in each others' life story; sex may or may not be involved at all.But, in this case, we can be sure that sex was involved, at a repressed level to start with. MacLaine came to realize that even touching Hepburn's hand was a pleasure which formerly she had chosen not to analyze too closely.Mary, the awful, precocious schoolchild, whom we have seen reading some 'dirty book' in bed at night with a flashlight, evidently got her hands on something very graphic indeed, and this is what horrified the grandmother when she whispered what she couldn't say aloud, in the back of the rich old lady's limousine. There was more to this account than merely a story of 'kissing'.As MacLaine says in her own great scene, somehow that monstrous little girl had sensed by intuition 'a grain of truth' to wrap her lie around. That 'grain of truth' becomes a snowball, by the end of the movie. MacLaine has confessed her love for Hepburn. Without histrionics, but with quiet honesty, Hepburn has confessed the same to her friend: "I love you, too." And Hepburn, even faced with total vindication and financial security from the libel award, never once considers contacting James Garner and putting their marriage plans back on track. Why not? The answer is that she herself has slowly come to a realization of her own need to make a life with MacLaine. She goes for her walk, ready for the future ahead.But it is MacLaine, looking lovingly out the window at Hepburn, almost blissfully, secure for the first time that she is loved and valued by the person she cares about the most, who still knows that the future ahead for the two of them will entail a higher price for her than she is willing to pay. She cannot face the inevitable physical expression of her love for Hepburn. She is also burdened by a dysfunctional family background, with her only relative being the crazed, delusional aunt who has sponged off of her, and then let her down when she ignored those telegrams pleading for her to come back to testify for the two of them.MacLaine and Hepburn do know, as they reveal in one of their final conversations, that there are lesbians, someplace, out there somewhere, who do accept themselves and who do somehow make lives for themselves. But MacLaine says, "We are not like that."Hepburn has the strength to try. MacLaine isn't strong enough.This is what Hepburn senses as she walks back towards the house, as she has been thinking things over on her walk. The aunt's calling out, looking for MacLaine, makes her really alarmed. But by the time she breaks down MacLaine's door, it is too late.Hepburn's second walk, after the funeral, so purposefully reminiscent of the previous walk, is the quick step of a soldier, marching to battle. She is not afraid. And she is free to make any choice she wants. The stick figures of the townspeople standing at the edge of the graveyard can never touch her again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, but intriguing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with several projects involving Lillian Helman, the backstory is nearly as interesting as the written work. In this case, her trailblazing play "The Children's Hour" was morphed into a film called "These Three". Because lesbianism was one aspect of the plot, the story had to be sanitized to meet the Hays Code in place at the time. The changes imposed on it actually resulted in a striking and memorable film. Years later, the same director (Wyler) attempted to tackle the original story in it's unaltered form, but, ironically, it was unable to match the level of the first movie. Here single, closely knit teachers Hepburn and MacLaine are just realizing their dream of running their own girls school when a bitter, vengeful child creates a snowballing, vicious rumor about them out of spite. Influential and "well-meaning" Bainter (the grandmother of the child) takes the rumor to heart and soon the school is in jeopardy, Hepburn faces losing her handsome doctor fiancée (Garner) and MacLaine is forced to face some painful truths about herself. The film is attractively shot and well-appointed in its details. Hepburn is lovely and does a fine job. MacLaine gets a meaty part with several strong moments. Garner shows surprising vulnerability along with his customary charm. Hopkins (a lead in "These Three") hams it up enjoyably as MacLaine's melodramatic aunt. Bainter lends her typically strong presence and was Oscar nominated (even if she occasionally looks like Herbert Marshall in drag.) Balkin (as the deplorable child) is appropriately spoiled and malicious, though it's hard to understand how the adults can't see through her machinations. One of her victims is Cartwright, who would later appear in "The Birds" and "Alien". Though the subject matter was still taboo even in 1961, enough of the elements come through in the film to get the points across. Unfortunately, the treatment of the subject is rather unenlightened and at times awkward. However, due to the timid approach to the material, creative use was made of visuals and unheard dialogue in order to avoid explicitly stating many of the details. Situated benignly into the dialogue (whether intentional or not one can't tell) are phrases like "in the closet" and "sissy". Alex North ingeniously interpolated the childhood song "Skip to My Loo" into his score whenever Balkin is around. (The song's lyrics detail spoilers like "fly's in the buttermilk" and "cat's in the cream jar" which are certainly in line with the type of ruination she causes everyone.) She must have been a little TOO annoying as she scarcely worked again after this. When all is said and done, the film is a well-heeled curiosity falling short of greatness, but offering a great early glimpse of attitudes toward homosexuality on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just an ounce of truth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Children's Hour More than just an ounce of truth... ((((SPOILERS))))) THE CHILDREN'S HOUR has gotten a rather bad rap over the years. It has gained this reputation that it is somehow a noble effort, but nonetheless a failure. That because of its subject matter and the era in which it was made, the need to gingerly handle the subject of lesbianism makes the end result seem dishonestly incomplete at best or just cowardly at worst. The fact that it is a tragedy which ends in the death of a gay character, underscores this need by some to devalue its importance and deride its power because it doesn't meet the harsher standards of political correctness.It is probable that if the film (or more accurately Lillian Hellman's original play) were to be filmed today, much of it would be altered. Even if a new version were set in the 1960s of the movie or the 1930s of the original play, the filmmakers would face considerable pressure to make the gay characters more defiant, the homophobic characters more transparently belligerent and the presumed nature of the lesbian relationship more explicit. And that would be the wrong thing to do. Even though the film was made on the eve of an era that saw censorship beginning to crumble, it depicts a time when homosexuality was barely mentioned, let alone something to inspire defiant pride. It has been suggested by Hellman, director William Wyler and star Shirley MacLaine that the gay angle of the story is really secondary to the story's main concern, that being the power of lies to destroy. I think this is more than a little disingenuous, a way of sidestepping the issue. Homophobia is the point of the story, whether the "lie" in the story is really a lie or not. That's why the 1936 film version, THESE THREE (also directed by Wyler), doesn't work, despite being well made and well acted. THE CHILDREN'S HOUR rings true, despite its evasive nature. Both films deal with two women who run a small, exclusive girls school whose lives and careers are destroyed by stories told by a couple of their pupils. In THESE THREE the story is sanitized so that it deals with accusations that one of the teachers has had an affair with the other's fiancé; THE CHILDREN'S HOUR returns to the play's original plot wherein the two teachers are accused of lesbianism. THESE THREE, though melodramatically played, has little dramatic weight: unsubstantiated accusations of an affair that everybody denies ever happened, might raise eyebrows, but hardly would carry such dire consequences, especially since the two children making the claims are shown to be so unstable and unreliable. And the film's desperate attempt at a happy ending doesn't help. Homosexuality has to be the linchpin of THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, because little else would create such irrational fear. The "lie" of the story would have to be so very threatening in 1961, otherwise it would not be credible that parents would overreact so fiercely or that the words of three upstanding citizens would be rejected over the claims of two foolish little girls. I think the film paints a fair and accurate picture of a time when homophobia wasn't considered a bigotry, but a logically parental concern. As such the film is neither pro-gay nor anti-gay, rather a consideration of a time of ignorance. Faye Bainter's Mrs. Tilford is what we would now call homophobic, but she is not an evil person. She is foolish to the extent that she can't see how manipulative and dishonest her grandchild is, but her actions against the school and its teachers are based on the prevailing social outlook of the time. She acts out of genuine concern, not hysterical outrage. Indeed, her view of homosexuality is not all that different from that of MacLaine's Martha Dobie, one of the accused teachers. It is Martha's suicide, upon admitting her true romantic feelings toward Audrey Hepburn's Karen Wright, that disturbs many who criticize the film. Martha is no more comfortable with homosexuality than Mrs. Tilford, but her fear of homosexuality is intensified and internalized. But Martha's death is not mandated to appease the moral atmosphere of the time, as some have suggested, nor because of her own self-hatred, but because that is the unfortunate logical path the story has to take. In a tormented confession, Martha reveals the contempt and shame she has for her feelings, but this is not meant to represent the honesty of homophobia, but rather the dishonesty of traditionally accepted mores. Pride and defiance are not options to Martha; she has neither the understanding nor the strength to endure the battle between her feelings and the moral convictions that society has taught her. As a tragic figure she is more than an appropriate symbol of her time. As a character, she is beautifully and sympathetically embodied by MacLaine in one of her finest performances.The film's message is not that homosexuality destroys Martha, but that ignorance poisons the waters. Martha's death is undeserved, but not a punishment of her lesbianism. Martha is a good person, a person who has our sympathy, not our pity. The injustice of her death confirms the film's empathy for the homosexual character. Unlike the faux happily-ever-after conclusion of THESE THREE, THE CHILDREN'S HOUR forces the viewer to question conventional morality. The film ends on a strangely ambiguous note. Martha confesses her feelings to Karen, but Karen evolves into an enigma. Even before Martha reveals her true feelings, Karen finally rejects her fiancé (played by James Garner), by forcing him to express the doubts about their relationship that she herself has apparently being harboring all along. But she accepts Martha's confession of love, yet makes no attempt to reciprocate. The film hints, but won't confirm that the "lie with the ounce of truth" is as true about Karen as it was about Martha. Karen seems to have gone from denying her feelings toward Martha to accepting them and then repressing them. The film ends with Karen leaving Martha's funeral, apparently strong-willed and defiant, but it is not clear just why. It's not likely that Karen feels vindication over Mrs. Tilford's apology, yet it is equally unlikely that Martha's death could possibly have inspired feelings of pride and defiance. The final shots of Hepburn possess an undeniable power, perhaps foreshadowing the changes in the way society would eventually view homosexuality. Martha's martyrdom makes Karen a stronger person, whatever her sexual inclination. It's not a happily-ever-after ending, but it is a promise of better endings to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Martha Dobie and Karen Wright are accused of lesbianism, they're entire world comes crashing down. Karen loses the man she loves and so happens to have been engaged to for two long years, Joe (James Gardner). Martha loses her life, basically, and everything that she's ever had. And this is all because of a vicious little brat that anyone with common sense wants to slap when they watch this movie, Mary Tilford. To say in the least, the end in completely unexpected. It makes you think that the world is over, and it takes time to adjust to the fact that this is"just a movie". But a terrificly wonderful movie at that. Heart breaking and wonderfully filmed, the "Children's Hour" is a terrific movie with outstanding actresses. Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MaClaine light up the screen! A definite 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The L word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler showed he wasn't afraid to tackle again this Lillian Hellman's play. He had directed the film years before, but the tone had been changed during the first version of "The Children's Hour". In fact, there is no gayness to speak of in the previous adaptation, "These Three".Even for 1961, when the film was released, lesbianism, was not treated, or seen, in the same fashion one encounters it everywhere today. In fact, the dialogue of the film doesn't include the word "lesbian" at all! Lillian Hellman was a woman committed to show the ills in society she lived in. Hypocrisy is dealt with in most of her work. In this film, she emphasizes the fatal consequences of how a lie can destroy lives, as it's the case here. Because of a brat's hatred for authority and discipline, Karen's and Martha's reputation suffer greatly because the adults are so bent into condemning them without much of an investigation to see if the accuser is lying, or not.Martha at the end reveals her feelings for Karen, which we suspected all along. There were no indications or tell tell signs between these two young women of any kind to substantiate the charges. In fact, Karen is extremely hurt by just being accused of being a lesbian, when she, for all appearances, is in love with young and handsome Dr. Cardin.When the truth is realized, we see how things change, but it's too late for Martha, who has taken things in her own hands. At the last scene we watch most of the people that have been instrumental in accusing Karen and Martha at the cemetery as they all feel guilty of what they have done to ruin these women.William Wyler got good acting in general of his small cast. Shirley MacLaine and Audrey Hepburn make good contributions as Martha and Karen. Miriam Hopkins is the self-centered aunt Lily. Fay Banter is Amerlia Tilford, the woman who is instrumental in ruining the women. James Garner is good as Dr. Cardin, and Karen Belkin makes an impression with her evil Mary Tilford.The film seems today as somehow dated. Mr. Wyler finally was able to do justice to Ms. Hellman's play.</fullReview>

The child who plays Mary Tilford is truly evil quite an excellent little drama queen. Her grandmother also plays an excellent role we truly feel for her when she realises her mistakes. We feel her pain. This film shows how what we build up life can be so easily destroyed and it shows society's prejudiced against love. A definite must see for the powerful acting.</fullReview>

The film is dated in that society today wouldn't bat an eyelash over such a sitation (in fact their school today would probably set attendance records) but you can substitute any minority or ethnic group for the 2 lead characters and see how people can suffer at the hand of discrimination.

		<fullReview>William Wyler's atmospheric drama has two teachers (Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine) be accused of lesbianism by a guileful schoolgirl, and then have that rumour ruin their job, their lives and their friendship.Somewhat of a taboo for the 60s, Wyler bravely tackles the subject with honesty and integrity, and his cast work well to bring the tense atmosphere to us. As the engaged, straight, Miss Wright, Audrey Hepburn suffers commendably, fighting always for the truth ? as she sees it, and as a result, losing her fiancée. Shirley MacLaine is the more ambiguous character of the two. It is not on whether the allegations were true (it is clear from the off that they are just slander of the worst kind from a bored, vindictive little girl) that the mystery of the film lies, but in whether her character does secretly love Hepburns', as more than a friend.The children are less apt in their roles. None of them have names worth remembering, but the main one who spreads the rumours does it with such exaggerated facial expressions that it is difficult at times of most intense drama not to laugh, and the other girl, who aids her in the spreading of lies, is also laughable in her "fear." However, if the intention was to make us dislike the children as much as possible, then they have succeeded.But the message is clear ? lies of such a powerful decree ? even if they are spawned off what is guessed to be the truth, will damage others. It's a hefty topic, and one that lacks slightly, due to the censorship of the time, no doubt, but the behaviour and actions of the characters still ring true today ? the hypocrisy of the kind aunt, the spreading of cruel lies just for fun, the boyfriend's abandonment, and how, at the end of the day, it is always the innocent that suffer, yet some, like Hepburn's character, are brave enough to walk out in the public, with their head held high in the air, because they know they were innocent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theme rings true even today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite various plot holes and other problems with the presentation, this film provides a sad tale of unrequited love gone horribly wrong due to the meddlings of a spoiled child.Hepburn as Wright is wonderful as usual but it is MacLaine as the burgeoning lesbian Dobie who provides a truly magnetic performance. The pair are co-owners and teachers in a small, exclusive boarding school, the Dobie-Wright School for Girls. Mary Tilford is a student there who is also something of a bully to the other girls; she regularly finds herself on the wrong side of her teachers. After a particular incident in which she is told told off for lying, she manages to concoct a story about Dobie and Wright being lesbian lovers. Naturally and predictably the story is passed around among the children's parents and the school is effectively closed.What follows is a sometimes overacted yet more often spot-on tale of the despair about being the victims of a powerful lie - one which alters the course of their lives forever. The fact that Dobie is a latent lesbian and has been in love with Wright complicates their plight, however it does provide the audience with a rarely-seen-on-film heartfelt "coming out" which rings sorely and sadly true even in our enlightened day.Interesting also to note that Veronica Cartwright (Lambert in 1979's "Alien") features as a girl bullied by Mary Tilford. Also Miriam Hopkins who plays Aunt Lily was in the 1936 version of this film ("These Three") as Martha Dobie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the Hays Code version of the 30s movie with Miriam Hopkins and Merle Oberon... and now the 1961 version ... I'm glad Wyler had a chance to bring out more of the theme. I've read some comments.... this is not at all dated if one knows the perils gay people have to teach.... and remember this was also a boarding school..... with the society moving toward anti-gay bashing again.... the reaction of a potential gay teacher at a school WOULD indeed raise eyebrows. For some reason society looks on gays as the sicko perverts that kill these poor little ones that are kidnapped out here ( oddly look at some recently...there are pedophiles... but not gay). Anyway the film is acted incredibly well. Shirley MacLaine gives a tour-de-force dramatic acting job in the film. I've rarely ever seen anything Hepburn was in that isn't interesting and leaves one with a curious scratching of the head to figure out the individual at the end ... her scene walking away at the end sparks a curiosity...might she have repressed a love beyond girl-hood friendship for MacLaine in the film. Fay Bainter, to me, though produces one of the best supporting roles in a movie to date. She was totally believable as the homophobic rich grandmother.... not unlike so many in society today ...... unless you are gay people... you have no idea of the Society disapproval and she is so right on. Miriam Hopkins captures the aunt in a far more tawdry, sleazy way than the original actress in the 30s version. Unfortunately if this movie is ever made again.... in my age, it will still be sanitized for Hollywood and ironically the 1961 version will probably be the truest to the original story. Garner is very innocent in his role as the love interest and very believable. The little grandchild reminds me of the girl -- in the Bad Seed...... if the 2 of them matched wits ... they'd be on Wide World of Wrestling -- Evil Children's star edition." This movie is excellent cinema, an actors' movie. A true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Love That Dare Not Even Be Thought About</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big screen finally got to see The Children's Hour as Lillian Hellman meant for it to be seen, a searing drama on the power of self hate of one's sexuality.This Pre-Stonewall gay drama is about two teachers who run a select school for wealthy young adolescent girls. One of them, Audrey Hepburn, has been engaged for a couple of years to Doctor James Garner, but she never quite gets around to getting married. The business of running the school with her friend and business partner Shirley MacLaine consumes all the time for both of them.A really bad seed of a kid, Karen Balkin, gets disciplined once to often as she sees it by Hepburn. The young girl concocts a story about seeing the two of them in a sex act and tells her guardian and grandmother Fay Bainter. Bainter does her own 'investigation' and confirms it in her eyes. The word spreads and the kids are withdrawn from the school rather than be tainted by being around those horrific lesbians.The Code was coming down. Though the word lesbian is never used in the film, that's what it's all about. Back in the day, Samuel Goldwyn took this story and made it a straight triangle story with Merle Oberon, Miriam Hopkins, and Joel McCrea. Back in the day the Code said that homosexuality could not even be discussed let alone dramatized. Now we're seeing what was a landmark drama about gay people, Lillian Hellman's vision as it really was. Just denying it isn't enough because there's a grain of truth to it. Repressed sexuality is a terrible thing and it's taking a strain on both of them. Shirley MacLaine finally cracks under it and admits that she's been crushing out on Hepburn ever since they first met in college. Remember that she lived in a society in the Thirties when The Children's Hour was first written where being gay was in some eyes worse than being an ax murderer. Finally coming out with it in the end was too much for her and it brings on terrible consequences for MacLaine.Back in the day when I was a working investigator for New York State Crime Victims Board, I recall a case where a man killed someone and wounded two other people. The Assistant District Attorney told me after the case was over that it was because the perpetrator was involved sexually with the deceased and the deceased was not in the closet whereas our perpetrator was. The victim wanted to tell the world about what he thought was the new love of his life. The perpetrator flipped out at the mention of it and killed him and wounded two friends. Self hate, internalized homophobia can be an awfully evil thing. Hellman could easily have written her play that way as well.Audrey Hepburn also, though she doesn't articulate it, wonders why is it she's stayed shut away in that school and doesn't commit to finally take the plunge and marry Garner. The Children's Hour is more than a play about the love that dare not speak its name, you can't even think it in the world of that time. MacLaine and Hepburn give two of their best performances of their respective careers. Miriam Hopkins who was in These Three, plays MacLaine's aunt who's a silly creature and who betrays the two women rather than be thought she condones the alleged lesbianism. Fay Bainter gave her final big screen performance here and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.William Wyler who directed These Three back in the day finally got to do the version as Hellman wrote it. He does as well for Hellman here as he did in The Little Foxes. He gets some of the best work out of all the players involved, even James Garner who's playing a distinct third fiddle here in a woman's picture in every sense of the word.The Children's Hour came to the screen in 1961. Brokeback Mountain which in many ways has the same themes as The Children's Hour for gay men was set originally in 1963. Both are great examples of the strides gay people have made in their quest for a place in the sunlight.Yet that case I described from my working years took place in the early Nineties. The closet might be thought of as a refuge, but it's a terrible prison for too many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cruel and Heartbreaking Story about the Destructive Power of a Lie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Karen Wright (Audrey Hepburn) and Martha Dobie (Shirley MacLaine) are best friends since college and they own the boarding school Wright and Dobie School for Girls with twenty students. They are working hard as headmistresses and teachers to grow the school and make it profitable. Karen is engaged with the local doctor Joe Cardin (James Garner), who is the nephew of the powerful and influent Mrs. Amelia Tilford (Fay Bainter). While the spiteful and liar Mary (Karen Balkin), who is Amelia's granddaughter and a bad influence to the other girls, is punished by Karen after telling a lie, Martha has an argument with her snoopy aunt Lily Mortar (Miriam Hopkins) in another room. Lily accuses Martha of being jealous and having an unnatural relationship with Karen. Mary's roommate Rosalie Wells (Veronica Cartwright) overhears the shouting and tells Mary what Mrs. Mortar had said about her niece. The malicious Mary accuses Karen and Martha of being lesbians to her grandmother and Amelia spreads the gossip to the parents of the students that withdraw them from the school. Karen and Martha lose a lawsuit against Amelia and have their lives destroyed. Further, Karen calls off her engagement with Joe when he asks her if what was said about Martha and she was true. The lie ends in a tragedy. "The Children's Hour" is a cruel and heartbreaking story that shows how destructive power of a lie may be. William Wyler is among my favorite directors and this film is a little gem with a magnificent screenplay. Shirley MacLaine has awesome performance in the role of a woman that does not accept her (homo) sexual preference and the girl Karen Balkin is amazing in the role of one of the meanest characters I have ever seen. In the mid 90's, in S?o Paulo, Brazil, the owners of the Escola Base were falsely accused of pedophilia in a national scandal and had their lives destroyed. Years later, it was proved that they were innocent, in a case of life copycatting fiction. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Infâmia" ("Infamy")</fullReview>

However, man did I get into this movie. This film was extremely controversial when it came out in the early 60's and has to do with gay rights. Definitely ahead of it's time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often that a director has an opportunity to remake his own film but with "The Children's Hour" (1962) William Wyler got a second crack at Lillian Hellman play about Martha and Karen, two schoolteachers (Shirley MacLaine and Audrey Hepburn) who are harmed by a resentful student. His first attempt was "These Three" (1936) and Hellman's lesbian elements were completely ignored. Not that they are dealt with that forthrightly in the remake but at least they get some attention. Interestingly Marian Hopkins, who plays MacLaine's aunt in the 1962 version, had MacLaine's role in the original. That film really belonged to child actors Bonita Granville (the original "Nancy Drew") and Marcia Mae Jones. There were actually three (not two) exceptional performances in "The Children's Hour". MacLaine and Fay Bainter are always mentioned in discussions about the film, but Veronica Cartwright's performance as the kelpto blackmail victim (Jones' part in the original) tends to get overlooked, simply because it was a smaller part and because she was a child actor. But Wyler really gets a stunning performance out of her; in what was probably the most challenging role in the whole production. Cartwright had considerably more acting for the camera experience (and innate talent) than Karen Balkin (who played Mary) and she is able to really showcase her skills in the scenes they have together.The film concerns two unmarried teachers who run a select school for wealthy pre-teen girls. Hepburn has been engaged to Joe, a local doctor (James Garner here-Joel McCrea in the original), for two years but has been evasive about setting a date for the marriage ceremony. When the school's only behavior problem, Mary (Karen Balkin in a somewhat one dimensional performance that will have you wishing for Granville but was probably what Wyler wanted this time around) is punished, she gets even by making scandalous accusations about the two teachers. These are compounded by the ill-advised remarks of Martha's aunt. Led by Mary's grandmother (Bainter) the whole town turns against the pair, Joe being the lone holdout. As the events play out Martha must eventually confront the fact that she is in love with Karen. Although "These Three" had a somewhat upbeat ending such is not the case with the 1962 version which at first glance seems to be saying that once you come out there is no option but suicide. Yet on closer examination you realize that Wyler has tacked on an almost expressionistic ending to his otherwise realistic film (note the off-kilter shots of Karen running toward the house and the shadow of Martha's body on the wall of her room). This stylistic change is to be read as an allegorical statement; that when a society banishes and ostracizes those who might deviate from normal convention, it denies such individuals a useful and productive place within its structure (in effect the right to exist).Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How gossip can destroy lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sad, well done movie about how the lies of a vengeful child can destroy everything they touch. The story concerns two single female teachers running a small girl's school. The school is finally making money and one of the teachers in newly engaged until a malicious student makes up lies about them to avoid being punished for her misdeeds. The lies spiral out of control and soon enough the school is out of business and the women find their lives ruined before it is finally realized that the student was lying all along, much to the horror of the adults who were all too ready to believe her.This movie is a strong reflection of the time it was made in. While even today, homosexuality is controversial, in this movie, it is only spoken of generally in code and hinted at with words like "unnatural acts." The story doesn't set out to lecture, but rather shows how easy it is for one lie to lead to another, and how idle gossip can become much more venomous if given the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Unfortunately Valid Today As It Was In The 1930s &amp; 1960s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and first staged in the 1930s, THE CHILDREN'S HOUR was master playwright Lillian Helman's first great success. It also provoked a scandal: the story concerned two women who run a school for girls--and who suffer scandal and personal tragedy when an unruly student accuses them of having a lesbian affair. The play was such a success that Hollywood wasted little time in buying the film rights, but the material was too hot for the 1930s film industry; the story was significantly rewritten into a fairly insipid love-triangle melodrama and was released under the title THESE THREE. It would be another thirty years before American film was ready to tackle the play head on.Many critics have noted that THE CHILDREN'S HOUR is not about lesbianism, but about the power of a lie. There is some truth to this, for the entire plot rests on the child's lie and its devastating effect. But Helman was not a superficial writer: once the knife goes in, she twists it several times, first in a series of emotional revelations between the leading characters and finally in a portrait of society that attacks any one perceived as different in any way--even to the point of driving them to death. Some complain that this is merely another Hollywood stereotype in which the gay character has to be punished by the film's conclusion, but I disagree; if anything, Helman's point remains as unfortunately valid today as it was in the 1930s and again in the 1960s.The cast ranges from solid to exceptional, and the supporting cast is exceptionally fine. Fay Bainter and Mirian Hopkins, both legendary actresses, give truly memorable performances in supporting roles; child actresses Karen Balkin and Veronica Cartwright also give remarkably powerful performances. And Audrey Hepburn and James Garner are rock solid as school teacher Karen Wright and her beau Dr. Cardin. But the raw power of the film comes from Shirley MacLaine, who gives one of the most inspired performances of her career as school teacher Martha Dobie. In this case superlatives are not enough: no one who sees the film will easily forget her tortured, passionate performance. Director William Wyler tells the story with great simplicity and to tremendous effect. Strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite Controversial Second Time Around.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler remade his own film version of Lillian Hellman's play THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, THESE THREE, and while it remains completely faithful to the literary source, it fails this time around despite the presence of Audrey Hepburn, James Garner, Shirley MacClaine, Fay Bainter, Veronica Cartright (in one of her child roles, playing Rosalie), and Miriam Hopkins portraying Mrs. Lily Mortar. It shows that sometimes the Hay's Code actually worked in favor of film making during the Depression years and not having so much explicitness conveyed the message much better and more effectively. Also, the transition Martha Dobie experiences during the film as she discovers her true sexual nature feels false and her decision to suddenly kill herself because she can't stand the guilt and shame she feels comes as forced by plot situations and the need to bring forth the tragedy, which today would be as unconvincing and dated as ever, but at least in her early years Shirley MacClaine shows she was ready for strong drama even if the material was not that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching melancholic love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn stars in William Wyler's film, based on Lillian Hellman's play, The Children's Hour. It's a story about a girls' school and its two teachers Karen Wright (Audrey Hepburn) and Martha Dobie (Shirley MacLaine). Things seem to be going well in their school until a trouble maker, Mary (Karen Balkin) makes up a rumor about the teachers' relationship, based on her thoughts and what she has heard. Everybody in the town start to believe in the story Mary has made up, leading Karen and Martha to despair.If you didn't guess already, this is a survey of homosexuality. In the movie, they don't dare to say the word out loud. But we see discussions behind doors and windows, we see the gestures of the characters. We follow the events as outsiders. To which the almost expressionistic black-and-white cinematography gives a great touch. The strong grip of nature, relying on the experience of an individual and simplified milieus fit for the story better than well.The rumor did much more harm than Mary could have guessed. It destroyed the relationship between Karen and her husband to-be Joe Cardin (James Garner). It destroyed everything they had worked hard for. But it also made Martha think about her real feelings about her good friend. The film is open for interpretation and it is not made clear whether the rumor was true or not in the first place. Or did the rumor just make Martha realize something, did it change her or did her mind change her because of the rumor. Wyler makes it clear that, actually, it doesn't matter whether the rumor is true or not. All the people are so shocked of this horrible sin that they blindly follow a child's story and drive two women into despair.Even that The Children's Hour approaches the case of being a lesbian carefully, I found this movie very brave. The censorship of Hollywood had loosened but still they had trouble bringing this up on the screen. I'm amazed with the result and I'm sure this touched many people in the 60's and made a lot of people broaden their horizons - and it still can. Many people even today are shocked to here about homosexuality. There still are many people who just can't accept it and that's what makes this movie timeless.The acting is superb - one of Hepburn's greatest performances but I liked the acting of Shirley MacLaine as well. Many people might know the director William Wyler as the director of Ben-hur; he's one of the greatest American filmmakers. This was another proof of his talents, The Children's Hour was very capturing, the characters were sympathetic - easy to relate to - and well built. It's no masterpiece but it is an incredibly capturing melodrama. Slightly expressionistic imagery and Wyler's calm, mature approach subject make this a remarkable film.The film's built on strong emotional scale. People scream, yell, cry and moan. It portrays pure grand emotions, and the topic's pretty harsh. But the director has placed a satirical twist to the film. Showing the people whispering, talking quietly about it but never saying it out loud. They're so afraid of it that they can't even say the word. Perhaps all the people are so insecure and vulnerable that they try to dodge the whole subject. Not even trying to search for themselves. It's never too late to find your identity and stop pretending. If looking at the film from this angle it breaks out from being just a provocative film about an unmentioned taboo. It's reaches an universal level studying the true identity of man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Wyler directs Lillian Hellman's provocative adapted play. A sensational story that exhausts emotions. The sensors must have really been put to task considering the early 1960's mores. Shirley McClaine and Audrey Hepburn, friends since high school, have partnered in running a private school for girls. Its been several years of operating without profit; but good news...the school has finally made some money and Hepburn becomes engaged to her doctor boyfriend James Garner. Things are all of the sudden no longer roses and wine, but poison ivy. Spoiled schoolgirl Karen Balkin decides to get back at her two teachers by spreading rumors that they are lesbians. The aggravating girl's grandmother Fay Bainter spreads the falsehood and all of the students are taken out of the school. Suspicion, tension and anxiety. Just how do you defend yourself against such sensational accusations? McClaine is flawless and Balkin is so real you want to reach out and grab her by the throat. Also in the cast: Miriam Hopkins, Veronica Cartwright, William Mims and Hope Summers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Children's Hour has subject matter relevant even today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this time weeks after California became the second state to recognize gay and lesbian marriages, I thought I'd finally get a look at a time when anyone even accused of loving someone of the same gender got him/her ostracized by watching The Children's Hour, a movie made in 1961 based on a play written by native New Orleanean Lilian Hellman in the 1930s. In this one, bratty girl Mary (Karen Balkin) lies to her grandmother (Fay Bainter) about a relationship between her teachers Karen Wright (Audrey Hepburn) and Martha Dobie (Shirley MacLaine). Another girl, Rosalie (Veronica Cartwright) gets roped to play along because she "borrows" some jewelry and doesn't want to get ratted out. A Dr. Joe Cardin (James Garner) defends fiancée Karen and Martha's honor in front of the rich grandmother but is unable to stop all the girl students from being sent elsewhere. And it doesn't help when Martha's actress aunt Lily (Miriam Hopkins) is conveniently away during most of the trial that results from a suit against the grandmother that she wins. This was a well done movie about how some lies can snowball to tragic consequences and how some truths can be found in those lies. Director William Wyler, who had previously filmed this as These Three but had to change some of the material to suit the Production Code of the time, brings his usual classy treatment to such sensitive material. Leads Hepburn and MacLaine, especially MacLaine, bring emotional power in their roles that challenge them to the fullest. Mr. Garner acquits himself nicely in his scenes with them. Hopkins and Bainter-with Ms. Hopkins a veteran of These Three-also provide fine support. As for the children, while Ms. Balkin does indeed seem too annoying as Mary to be convincingly charming even to her grandma, Ms. Cartwright is just the right side of frightful in her reluctance as Rosalie to cross Mary to her face. Of course, I think Grandma is so prejudiced that thinking what her granddaughter whispered was out-and-out lies was the last thing on her mind. And the difference between attitudes then and now is heartbreakingly brought out at the end when Martha reveals her true feelings to Karen before Karen takes a walk and then the aftermath when she runs back in... While homosexuality may be more open and accepted today, there's still some backlash that makes this movie even more relevant now. And seeing Garner back-to-back in this and Sayonara just now makes me appreciate how brave he was in appearing in these then-provocative films. So on that note, I highly recommend The Children's Hour. P.S. My condolences to Hepburn's and Mel Ferrer's son Sean on the recent death of his father at the age of 90.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are only a few films I would give a 9 out of 10 rating. This William Wyler gem is one of them. Based on the Lilian Hellman play, 'The Children's Hour' is basically about dirty lies and spoiled children in a small community setting. How lies can destroy the lives of individuals is a testimony to their power.Audrey Hepburn does a splendid job, and a lot of her acting is done with her eyes which are very expressive. There is no one better. Shirley Maclaine is also superb as Martha, one of the two principals accused of what was then considered 'unlawful, unnatural sexual knowledge of one another'. What an outstanding piece for these two powerful actresses! You can't ask for anything better. There is a little overacting (Maclaine's 'confession' to Karen) and James Garner at times (some thought he was miscast), but Faye Bainter gives one of the best performances on film as Mrs Tilford.While the theme may seem a little outdated, this film was great, and still stands strong when you view it again and again.</fullReview>

I believe it says a lot that over 40 years later, we still want to comment and view this movie (a movie that is not necessarily a popular classic that people know about). I had never heard of this movie until looking on Netflix and deciding to rent all the Audrey Hepburn movies. While she is fabulous, I thought Shirley M was the shining performance in this movie. James Garner is so genuinely loving and likable (as usual!) The other characters are also fabulous but for length I won't list them all! I highly recommend this film to someone who appreciates dramatic film with good character development. It is definitely not what I expected from something on an Audrey Hepburn list (which makes me love her more)! Some raters feel that this movie has homophobic undertones and is not appropriate for today's society (because we are so open minded now???). As someone who has worked with youth of today in a small town, I believe it is still relatable. I think it would open up a good discussion because I felt hope in the midst of tragedy (I don't want to give away anything but basically a "what could you have done instead" dialog).I weeped at the end but would watch it again as it is superb. I would give it a 10 but having only seen it once, I feel biased as I'm sure there are minor flaws somewhere! I give it a 9.9/10 instead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crucible Lillian Hellman Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lilliam Hellman was a modern female writers and ahead of all of the female writer of her time (except for my fave Zora Neale Hurston). The film "The Children's Hour" based on Hellman's play tells the story of two young women whose lives and reputations are destroyed after a horrible little girl tells everyone that the two young women are lesbians. In a time period from which the play was set does not use the words "lesbian" or "homosexual" and are substituted with "unnatural." Homosexuality in the play/film was treated the same way as it was back then: a tragic and horrible disease punishable by death for certain. It is a painful film to watch. Audrey Hepburn is lovely as always as Karen and she was also one of the few actresses who was not afraid to take on a role that was avaunt garde. She has tender and sweet moments with James Gardner, who is also wonderful as Dr. Joe Cardin, Karen's fiancée. And then there is my favorite: Shirley MacClaine who steals scenes with such agony as Martha, a young woman who realizes that she is in fact different and is a lesbian, but lives in a time and place that would not never allow her to be free to express her feelings. In a touching and agonizing scene, Martha reveals her true feelings for Karen. MacClaine breaks your heart and many can relate to her. She wins us over and breaks our hearts. Other supporting actors included are Fay Bainter as Mrs. Tilford, the rich and powerful woman who is made the pawn of spreading the lies told by her granddaughter; the wonderful Miriam Hopkins is Martha's judgmental and hypocritical Aunt Lilly Mortar; Veronica Cartwright is sweet and innocent as the young girl tortured into confirming the lie. And of course, the little girl we all love to hate: Mary played by Karen Balkin. Mary is a nasty little girl and throughout the film all you want to do is strangle her. Why the character of Mary Tilford didn't make the AFI list of 100 Greatest Villains I will never know because here is an "innocent" child telling a horrible lie without realizing the consequences of her actions. "The Children's Hour" is a very hard film to watch at times, but one of the most important films pivotal to the 1960s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Relevant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A riveting remake of the 1930's movie, both of which are derived from Lillian Helman's play. The Hays code in the 30's forced the movie to dance around the lesbian subtext of the play. In this 1960's remake, the issue was more directly addressed.Two women (Hepburn and Maclaine) run a boarding school for girls. Hepburn is engaged to a character played by James Garner. A sociopathic girl accuses the women of having a lesbian relationship, and their lives are ruined. Eventually the lie is found out, but everyone involved, including the accusers, is irrevocably harmed. In thinking about this type of situation today it is clear that the accusers would never have a sense of shame about ruining other people's lives. That sense of honor is the one big underlying motivation of this drama (really a very good melodrama) that is not contemporary.The despair and horror about the lesbian accusation is spot-on for 1960 (and before); the country having just gone through the McCarthy/Reagan/Cohn witch-hunts, which focused on both ruining and in many cases imprisoning gay men and women and alleged Communists. Lillian Helman was blacklisted for being a communist. So I can see how this story must have still resonated for her, years after writing the original play. She is credited for the screen adaptation. The story is surprisingly still contemporary.Today the religious right is actively pursuing these kinds of witch-hunts against gay men and women; and if you are raised in a family with these kinds of beliefs, the despair felt by such self realization can still literally be deadly.A few years back children in the McMartin preschool in Los Angles were coaxed into making outrageous claims that a respected older woman and her entire family actively molested children, and ran a preschool for the purpose of supplying her allegedly pedophile son. The government spent fifteen million dollars "investigating" and a six year criminal trial of this family and its school; with each week for two years bringing forth increasingly bizarre and horrible charges about sexual satanism, etc. etc. The school was closed, the family was ruined and some members died, temporarily went to jail, etc. All accusations later turned out to be fabrications of the children which were planted by supposed experts, and prosecuted by district attorneys thrilled to get the chance to further their careers with press exposure at the expense of the innocent. The press smeared the McMartin family. Although any sane person could tell the stories were literally impossible to be true (for several reasons), the so-called experts said "Children this age don't lie," which is exactly the premise of the movie for destroying the lives of the characters played by Hepburn, Macclain, and Garner. Like this movie, in the McMartin case, the children as adults almost all recounted their accusations. The original accusation was made by a paranoid schizophrenic, who also alleged that the abuse included having an elephant injure her son and having a pair of scissors stuck in his eye (of which there was no physical proof). Her psychotic delusions were withheld from the defense. As in the movie, all of the individuals involved were financially ruined, became pariahs, were the subject of press libel (Oprah, Giraldo, etc. etc.), and the schools were closed (and literally leveled).Although the times have changed a bit, this underlying premise of the movie is still spot-on. I was prepared to find the way the lesbianism was dealt with to be dated. It really was not, our president is behind efforts to rewrite the constitution to strip gay men and women of civil rights; and several states have recently passed laws to make it impossible for gay men and women to adopt children.As the movie came to its conclusion, the various story lines and the impact on the characters had to come to a dramatic conclusion. Mostly this was done with catastrophic consequences which were still dramatically successful, although a bit melodramatic on first glance by today's attitudes towards being gay or lesbian. There is also an extremely strong messages of hope and empowerment in Hepburns character, which balances the negative somewhat. However, thinking about some of the contemporary hysteria and prejudice (the MacMartin example and the writing new laws to prevent gay men and women from being around children); it is clear for a sizable part of our country, little has changed.This movie was both dramatically outstanding, beautifully filmed, and ultimately surprisingly thought provoking and contemporary.A winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Synopsis: Karen Wright, (Audrey Hepburn), and Martha Dobie, (Shirley MacLaine), have been best friends since they were seventeen. They open an elite girl's school together and are on their way to becoming moderately successful. Karen is engaged to Dr. Joe Cardin, (James Garner), but has refused to set a wedding date until the school is actually successful. Dr. Cardin has a young cousin, (once removed), Mary Tilford, (Karen Balkin), attending said school. Unfortunately, Mary is a compulsive liar with a spiteful nature. Mary proceeds to tell lies, made up of fact and fiction, to her loving grandmother, Mrs. Amelia Tilford, (Fay Bainter), in the hopes of not having to return to the school where she is continually disciplined for her obvious lies, (obvious to everyone but her grandmother). Mrs. Tilford, (who is Joe's aunt), believing her granddaughter, does the one thing she thinks to be morally right and that is to unknowingly spread these lies to other parents. Parents pull their kids from the school and Karen, Martha and Joe are left to defend themselves unsuccessfully against the lies of a little girl. The truth is finally revealed, but with the damage already done, only tragedy is left as the victor.Recommendations: Sensitively directed by William Wyler, this film was and is groundbreaking. Technically speaking it has authentic black and white art direction, perfect cinematography, believably authentic costumes and excellent work done by the sound engineers. Still it is the acting by the glorious Audrey Hepburn, the brilliant Shirley MacLaine, the sensitive James Garner and the annoyingly real Miriam Hopkins, who plays Martha's aunt and employee, who bring this movie to life. Having said all that, it is the supporting work of Fay Bainter that completes this film, with her heartbreaking grace and aching search for moral fortitude, she becomes the conscious of this film and the conscious of the times. She is brilliant. In closing, I know that the ending of this film has troubled many an opened minded individual who thinks that the decision taken by one of the two heroines is a painful and a seemingly easy cop out, but I say to those people that if you watch this film carefully you will realize that her decision is not the only option given, it is just the option that she regrettably chooses. This film, viewed with an open mind, even with its heartbreaking ending, did and does more for equality than is apparent to the eye. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent character and social study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a stage play by Lillian Hellman, The Children's Hour is a story about taboo, the implications of lies and the naive and selfish mentality of children. Being based on a play, the film is as melodramatic as you'd expect; but as the cast is made up of such a talented bunch of actors, the melodrama never gets in the way of the plot, or point of the film. The Children's Hour stars two of it's days biggest female stars; Audrey Hepburn and Shirley Maclaine, who play teachers, and owners, of a private girls boarding school. Their lives fall into disarray when a spiteful student accuses the two women of having a lesbian relationship. Nowadays, we've moved on a bit so the women of this film's problem wouldn't be all that great today; but when put into the context of the film's setting and the moods at the time, it gives the film a very potent social commentary. The film balances this with a character study of it's main characters, and together these two elements blend into one very good film indeed. Add a brilliant script and some fine acting performances into the mix; and you've got a film that's damn near perfect.Despite the fact that it stars two of the biggest stars of it's day in Audrey Hepburn and Shirley Maclaine; the standout performance of the film for me comes from the young Karen Balkin, in the role of the troublesome child at the centre of the scandal. Balkin steals every scene she's in, even when on screen with the two leads, and despite the fact that her character is repulsive; I always found myself waiting for her to come back on screen. It's a shame she only made one other film after this one. The film is really well written, and we delve into the character's nightmare; we get to learn more about them as people, as well as learning about the social implications of the scandal. The film balances these two elements perfectly, and this always ensures that the film has enough intrigue to keep the audience's interest. The central point of the implications of lies is very potent at all times, and this was the most interesting aspect of the movie to me. How so many people can form their opinions of someone on the words of a child is made more frightening by the fact that this sort of thing could, and most probably has, actually happened. On the whole; like most of Audrey Hepburn's work in the sixties - this is an excellent film and comes with high recommendations!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Children's Hour" is a great movie that was very much ahead of its time in 1961. Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine play teachers who are accused by a deceitful student of having a lesbian relationship. This causes much friction in the school community, as the two women are shunned. And as might be expected when your whole world is turned upside down, these rumors cause tragedy.Audrey Hepburn is radiant as always, and Shirley MacLaine gives one of her best, most underrated performances. James Garner and Fay Bainter are also great in their supporting performances. "The Children's Hour" is a fantastic drama that you definitely don't want to miss!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I definitely remember seeing this movie as a youngster, well before I had come out to friends and family, and it left an indelible impression on me and actually provided me with survival tools, all people, regardless of their differences would invariably need to effectively deal with societal intolerance. (As a matter of fact, being gay and African-American, an excellent companion piece to this film would be "A Raisin in the Sun." This constitutes inspiration of the highest order!!)The performances are spellbinding, most notably, Audrey Hepburn and Shirley McClaine. It was indeed ahead of its time and quite frankly I am surprised it has not been re-done. But on second thought, regardless of cast, there would be very little that a remake could lend. This would be a classic example of "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." This version does exactly what it was intended to do: open up a dialog. It is uncompromising and tastefully done with wrenching performances and is just as timely today as when it was first produced. I heartily recommend it as a thought-provoking and important film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot (SPOILERS HERE!): A tragic story about two woman whose life's destroyed by a gossip. Karen and Martha has a private school for young girls and an evil student after hearing things about Martha's opinion about Karen's and his boyfriend's marriage tells her grandmother that the 2 women are lesbians. Her grandma takes her from the school and tells the story to the other girls' parents, too. The school must close without students. Karen and Martha starts a legal action to prove they're not 'guilty', but lost the cause. Karen and his boyfriend break up because she think he'll never REALLY believe that she and Martha didn't do anything. Later, the truth turn out and everyone ask them to forgive but it's too late: Martha finds out that she really loves Karen and hangs herself.Some people say it's dated but we've always had the same problems since this damned world exist. Even a gossip can destroy someone's life... this is out worst quality, the people often tell unreal stories about other people without thinking about what can happen after it. In this two ladies' case, the results turned tragically.Audrey Hepburn was absolutely breathtaking as Karen. The way she looked when she found Martha dead...one of her underrated dramatic performances, I think she was just brilliant. Shirley MacLaine was also pretty good. The young girl who played Mary was very annoying (I wanted to come into the TV and hit her, lol), just as she had to be. The cast was good overall.It's a very true film and everyone who don't belive in Audrey's dramatic talent should see it.I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of a Lie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, "The Children's Hour," stunned me when I first saw it in 1961. Now, 45 years later, it still has that power because of not only the superior performances of all involved but also the power of John Michael Hayes's screenplay, which is equally strong, and William Wyler's fantastic direction.I am happy for Lillian Hellman's memory that the producers didn't make the same mistake that Paramount Pictures made when they originally filmed it -- a true sellout of an author and her excellent stage play -- as "These Three." Avoid that trinket at all costs!! Audrey Hepburn is remarkable as she plays one of the most difficult roles of her career. Never has Shirley Maclaine controlled her performance as well as she does in this film. James Garner is superb as a powerless dupe, the kind of role that he never played! Especially applauded also should be Fay Bainter as the wealthy woman whose spoiled, lying granddaughter causes the trouble and who, because she is drawn into the lie, goes through hell as the result of her subsequent actions. The scenery-chewing performance usually given by Miriam Hopkins, who played MacLaine's role in "These Three" and now plays MacLaine's trouble-causing aunt, has been wonderfully curtailed and controlled by director William Wyler. Karen Balkin plays the lying child so completely; the role was created brilliantly in "These Three" by Bonita Granville; Balkin lives up to Granville's standard in this version."The Children's Hour" is a magnetic, totally absorbing powerhouse of a film. If you haven't seen it, don't miss it. If you have seen it, renew your acquaintance with it. You will never be disappointed by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like movies where the collective is portrayed honestly, like in this one, where liars and morons are believed and innocent people are harmed but the truth comes out in the end. The direction and acting are superb, from top to bottom. There're no holes in either. So often actors, even good ones, are not all the way there in a performance. The tension is so well presented here also. Even the children are quite good. Another similarly themed movie is Stalag 17, one of my favorites. Both movies present a truth about society that many people refuse to accept in any other form, a smallness that is stifling, a quickness to the see the worst in people without sufficient investigation. It also reminds me of To Kill a Mockingbird for the same brutal reality of human frailty. To me these are the best kinds of movies, ones that depict archetypal themes in well laid out narratives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not dated at all !.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The themes explored in The Children's Hour are far from dated, so i just can't conspire to other writers who feel this way.Karen and Martha are best friends who share a home together, they also work at the same all Girls school. Mary Tilford is a spiteful little child, when she is caught out for a lie she is duly scolded. In retaliation she starts casting doubts about the nature of Karen &amp; Martha's relationship, pretty soon the gossip spirals out of control and the ladies are faced with empty classrooms and strained relations at home. A court case is in the air, but just what will be the outcome with a society so quick to frown on something that they deem unnatural?, regardless of it being truth or fiction.Coming as it did in 1961, The Children's Hour was something of a brave picture, possessing as it does, a plot strand about lesbianism. Yet the film is itself a remake of These Three from 1936, tho also penned by Lillian Hellman {William Wyler directing both pieces}, These Three was built around a heterosexual tryst. The force driving The Children's Hour on is its willingness to explore a then frowned upon topic, whilst simultaneously running a plot arc about the power of a devious tongue, the innocence of youth a cloak shielding bitter intentions. Audrey Hepburn is a wonderful piece of casting, her portrayal of Karen is very restrained, giving the character an aura of worth and gracefulness. James Garner plays Karen's beau, Dr. Joe Cardin, he's a crucial part of the story but Garner never really dominates the screen in the way you feel the character should, however in the face of the films best performance, it's probably understandable that Garner is hardly worth a second glance. That best performance comes from Shirley MacLaine, it's a towering acting job full of wrought emotion and steely determination, it's only during the films last quarter do you realise just how well MacLaine has layered Martha. MacLaine and Hepburn are very different in acting styles, and this makes The Children's Hour a character piece to savour in any decade. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Brokeback Mountain" of its day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the Orpheum Theater in Tulsa, Oklahoma the year it came out. Why is that memory so clear after forty-four years? Because "The Children's Hour" was controversial. And why was it controversial? Not because it was about children's lies, but because it was about the nature of those lies that involved an accusation of lesbianism. The movie stayed for a short run, and it was best to have seen it with a partner of the opposite sex, lest suspicion fall on you. A comment that summed up the majority attitude was, "Why would anyone want to see *that* kind of movie?" Such was the view from the heartland at the time. Independent from the surrounding controversy, this story of two women who run a school for young girls being brought down by a rumor started by a malicious student stands on its own.The casting is near perfect. Audrey Hepburn, known more for her roles in musicals, romantic comedies, and genial suspense yarns is cast in a real dramatic part here as Karen Wright, co-founder of the elite school for young girls. In contrast to her other movies where her beauty is accentuated and used as a selling point ("Funny Face" being a prime example), in her unadorned appearance here she has never been more attractive. The black and white photography is uniformly top notch and close-ups are used to great effect. That works to Hepburn's advantage in particular. Shirley MacLaine has never been better as the anguished and tragic Martha Dobie. James Garner, as Dr. Cardin, does well as Hepburn's fiancée; Fay Bainter's performance as MacLaine's mother I found to be a bit over-the-top; and Miriam Hopkins dominates every scene she is in. Karen Balkin as the malevolent little rumormonger does her job in making you truly hate her. Spite seems to be such a core element of her personality that one wonders if she would ever have regrets about the devastation she brought about with her accusations.Wyler uses a sledgehammer to pound his points home when a tap hammer might have worked better. For example, I think that hanging would not have been Martha's method of choice to end it all, but I suppose it makes for good drama.I liked the ambiguous ending. Why wasn't Dr. Cardin more aggressive in pursuing Karen? Did his desire to keep his job enter into that? Did he not trust Karen? Did Karen not trust him? Did Karen not trust herself? What was Karen's true feeling for Martha? Was her friendship with Martha truly strong enough that she would offer to go away and start from scratch with her?As mentioned in my opening paragraph, this movie has significance beyond its being just another movie. Movies such as "The Children's Hour" illustrate the intimate relationship between movies as reflecting culture and movies as effecting cultural change. For me, and I think a lot of people, this was the first movie with mainstream actors (and good actors at that) that dealt with homosexuality in a non-stereotypical way. Much has changed since, but much as stayed the same. Certainly homosexuality has gained more acceptance with each passing generation, but I wonder if the circumstance detailed in this movie were to exist now, whether the reaction might not be pretty much the same. There are still a lot of people who see homosexuality as a mental illness or view it as immoral. In any case, when you mix sexual behavior that differs from what is considered normal with young children, people get a bit skittish - consider that the Boy Scouts can ban gay scout leaders. Currently if a young child even hints at molestation, there will be hell to pay no matter what the truth is, so remaking "The Children's Hour" where the false accusation is molestation rather than lesbianism would play with believability today. And it is only with "Brokeback Mountain" that major stars were willing to take on non-stereotypical gay male roles, but even there the idea that gay relationships must end in tragedy is still present.So, I am not sure just how dated "The Children's Hour" is. Ironically, instead of its treatment of lesbianism, the single thing that seemed most obviously dated was that Dr. Cardin was a smoker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Children's Hour" (1961): First a warning: If you are UNWILLING to view this film in the social context of the 1930's-1960's, you will not appreciate it as you should. Shirley MacLaine, Audrey Hepburn, James Garner, Miriam Hopkins, and Fay Bainter, Karen Balkin; produced and directed by William Wyler; written and adapted for the screen by Lillian Hellman. Set in an all-girls school, we meet two dedicated young teachers trying to raise good young society girls for their parents. Of course, there are always bad apples in the barrel? and thus starts a handsomely photographed, dramatically scored story of rumor, gossip, and life-altering tragedies that appear to have the upper hand. It is indeed a sad story, and, if seen through the eyes of a 2008 viewer, could seem exaggerated or overly dramatic. Numerous innuendos are solved not in the dialog, but interesting visual ways. It is emotionally and intellectually/artistically a film worthy of your serious viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, this extraordinary film is not dated...It still rings heartbreakingly true.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This powerful, truly riveting, ultimately heartbreaking film rings true, even today. In the recent spate of teen suicides often linked to bullying where the favorite word of choice is "Fag!!", our so-called enlightened, more mature society is still too often the breeding ground of tremendous prejudice, where it is still OK to look on homosexuality as either a sickness, or a misguided "choice" of lifestyle, or, simply, a disgusting perversion. The tale begins as a fascinating look at a girls boarding school with its range of vividly defined characters among the students and staff...becomes a tremendously suspenseful tale where the viewer has no idea the direction it will take, causing the audience to really sit on the edge of their seats as the events unfold, and then, in an astonishing dramatic twist, becomes a tortured tale of those hidden personal feelings that well up in heartbreaking, searing emotion--made all the more powerful and gut-wrenching by the amazing performance of Shirley MacLaine and the carefully calibrated relationship she has with Audrey Hepburn. We are watching two of the greatest film actresses in the 20th century at their very peak, working with Lillian Helman's beautifully written dramatic tale-- this is a film that is definitely not dated. It is powerful, profound, sadly too true today as it was in the early 1960's...and it deserves to be called a classic. Shirley MacLaine's assessment of the film I think is wrong. She has stated that in making the film-- astonishingly the actors never even discussed the homosexual aspects of the film. That may be surprising by today's indeed more enlightened standards with regard to the behind-the- scenes story of the film. BUT with regard to the film itself, and the fact that the word Lesbian or Homosexual was not even stated out loud, or that Martha had to completely hide her feelings--that definitely does not ring hollow. That story line, even in today's slightly more understanding society, probably plays itself out thousands and thousands of times--with endings not necessarily as tragic--but still as sad and pathetic. The film works today, transcending its time and place, becoming universal in its understanding of human emotion, because it delves into the psyche of its characters-- examining their strong feelings, explicit or hidden, their fears, worries, their struggles with life, with personal relationships, with society..with being a human being in a sometimes uncaring or unsympathetic world where they simply want to love and be loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Wyler masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lillian Hellman wrote "The Children's Hour" in 1934, a play about two women who are accused of "improper homosexual relations" by a troublesome child. These allegations spread like wildfire, and pretty soon the two women are being persecuted by local townsfolk. Jewish, a communist and hounded by the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), Hellman intended her play as a comment on both Nazi Germany's persecution of Jews, and America's persecution of radical leftists. The play was adapted by director William Wyler in 1936. Titled "These Three", Wyler's version omits the overt lesbianism of Hellman's play but keeps her political metaphors intact.In 1961, Wyler would once again adapt Hellman's play. Now titled "The Children's Hour", this version starred Audrey Hepburn and Shirley Maclain as Karen and Martha, a pair of close friends who've founded a boarding school for girls. One vindictive student spreads a rumour that Martha and Karen are lesbians, a rumour which shocks their conservative, early 20th century New England town. This was, after-all, a time in which homosexuality was deemed "evil", "unnatural" and "unholy". To make matters worse, gays were often violently persecuted, castrated, beaten to death or even lobotomised.But Hellman was't really interested in homosexuality. Her play was less interested in "lesbians" than it was in being an anti-fascist allegory. In Hellman's hands, the mischievous, wealthy child who hurls accusations at Karen and Martha becomes emblematic of all manipulative, powerful entities who aid, abet and instigate different forms of racial, cultural or ideological persecution. The various characters who side with or uncritically believe this silver-tongued kid then become Hellman's version of what Hannah Arendt would later call the "banality of evil" - the ability of ordinary citizens to unknowingly or knowingly propagate evil.Wyler, though, is not interested in anti-fascist allegories. He is genuinely making a "film about lesbians". Indeed, he says he remade "The Children's Hour" specifically to restore the homosexuality missing from his earlier adaptation. The result is, arguably, not only the first masterpiece directly about homosexuality, but also the first great "coming out" film.And so in Wyler's hands, "The Children's Hour" becomes a romantic tragedy in which Martha has spent her life both loving Karen from afar and hiding her homosexuality. Worse still, she has spent her life being culturally programmed to hate herself. To see herself as a freak. A monster. An aberration. Indeed, Wyler's film works as well as it does largely because its first 90 minutes find Martha vehemently denying her homosexuality and disgusted by the accusation that she might be gay. The film's first three acts are so aghast at homosexuality, so homophobic and anti-gay, that the eventual revelation that Martha really is gay is all the more powerful. In an instant we feel the sheer weight she has been carrying, the sheer level of internalised hate, the sheer level of suffering, confusion, pain, panic, loneliness and sadness she and other homosexuals (particularly in her era) routinely endured."The Children's Hour" climaxes with Martha revealing to Karen that she has always loved her. In a long, powerful monologue, Martha bares her soul: "I lie in bed night after night praying that it isn't true. But I know it's there. I don't know how, I don't know why, but I did love you! I do love you!" Karen, who is heterosexual (though Wyler hints that she might not be), is shocked by this revelation, but never responds with anything less than total love and sympathy.Devastaingly tragic, "The Children's Hour" remains fresh, ahead of its time, and did well to challenge censorship rules in an era of crumbling discrimination. Unsurprisingly, it was poorly received by critics in 1961. They wanted more sensationalism, a more overt handling of a lesbian relationship, whilst modern audiences raised in the wake of various queer movements are perhaps less salacious, and seem to respond to the film on a deeper emotional level (as late as 2008, the film was coming first place in queer film festivals). Much of the film's modern fame seems to stem from its sensitive portrayal of an insecure woman's repression of her sexual orientation, an angle seldom explored in today's age of "proud, open homosexuality".Slow in its middle acts, "Hour" opens and closes strongly. The film is anchored by Hepburn and Maclaine's fine performances, Hepburn angular and frail, Maclaine soft and volatile. Now more cultural icons than actors, both women are admittedly only called upon to shine in couple scenes. The chisel-chinned James Garner elevates a thankless co-starring role.Wyler would direct a number of very good films ("The Big Country", "The Best Years of Their Lives", "Detective", "Dodsworth", "The Letter", "Ben Hur", "The Good Fairy", "Jezebel", "The Little Foxes", "Dead End", "Roman Holiday", "The Heiress"), but "The Children's Hour" remains one of his best. Around the same time, homosexual directors like George Cukor and Vincente Minnelli were negotiating similar material.8.9/10 ? See "Tea and Sympathy", "Some Came Running", "The Sandpiper", "Far From Heaven" and "Young Man With a Horn".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a 1934 Lillian Hellman play, formerly adapted by Wyler as These Three in 1936. He re-adapted it later on because the play deals with homosexuality, and originally it had to be heavily changed to make it to the theaters. The 1961 film stars Shirley MacLaine and Audrey Hepburn as two boarding school teachers. When student Karen Balkin gets in trouble, she embellishes a conversation she hears between MacLaine and her aunt (Miriam Hopkins, who starred in These Three), to make it seem like MacLaine and Hepburn are lesbian lovers. When Balkin's grandmother (Fay Bainter) hears about it, she takes her granddaughter out of the school and convinces other parents to do the same. Hepburn and MacLaine desperately try to counteract the rumors, but cannot defeat them. For a long time, I wasn't entirely involved in this. But I like where it went, and, in the end, it's quite moving. Hepburn and MacLaine are both wonderful. MacLaine should have gotten an Oscar nomination for it, I think (I'd say Hepburn, too, but she already had Breakfast at Tiffany's). The only actress who did get a nomination was Bainter, though, which I don't quite get. I'd go for Hopkins over her. Balkin is really awful as the kid. She's a horrible little overactor. James Garner is pretty dull as Hepburn's love interest.</fullReview>

And the angles used to cut the scenes were so dramatic! You will see what I mean when you watch it. My favorite cast member was Fay Bainter as Mrs. Amelia Tilford (the grandmother). I think I liked her because of her facial acting skills. I think I will start watching more black and white films. The title "The Children's Hour" doesn't seem to fit.

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Out of the closet and far more explicit then the original 1936 version of the Lillian Hellman play "These Three" the film "The Children's Hour" shocked audiences back in 1961 not just about its depiction of lesbianism but it evoking sympathy for the person exhibiting it! Which was light years ahead of any other film which were few in numbers about this long, at least in movies from out of Hollywood, unmentioned and taboo subject.Running the Wright-Dobie school for young girls both Martha Dobie, Shirley McLaine, and Karen Wright, Audrey Hepburn, were close friends since they were teenagers. This friendship was strained when Karen got engaged with the school's doctor on call young handsome and hunk of a man Dr. Joe Cardin, James Garner, which had her good friend Martha very upset about. It wasn't until problematic and always not telling the truth 12 year old student Mary Tilford, Fay Bainter, overheard Martha's Aunt Lily, Mariam Hopkins, say something very "queer" about Martha's strange relationship with her best friend Karen that things started to go sour for the two school headmistresses. Not quite fulling understanding what exactly Aunt Lily meant Mary in wanting to get even with Karen &amp; Martha for punishing her for her fibbing about herself, at the expense of others, went to her Grandma Mrs. Amelia Tilford, Fay Bainter, the most prominent person in town and tells her about both Karen &amp; Martha strange and, as Aunt Lily called it, unnatural relationship!All this talk by Mary would have been written off as a vicious childish prank but as they say where there's smoke there's fire and there was a lot of fire behind Mary's accusations! They in the end destroyed a beautiful friendship between the two women as well had Dr. Joe Cardin's forthcoming marriage to Karen! With an emotionally destroyed and grieving Karen walking out on him as the movie came to its tragic end!***SPOILERS*** Forthright and unflinching the film treated the relationship between Martha and Karen not as a crime, which it was in most states at the time, or sickness but treated those who were shocked by it, which included Dr. Cardin, as the villains in the film. Karen who was straight and had no inkling in what her good friend Martha looked upon her as, a lover, still didn't desert her like Dr. Cardin did when the truth came out, from Martha herself, about her sexuality. In fact Karen grew even closer to her friend in understanding her and excepting who she was not turning her back on her as if she was some kind of freak of nature; Which almost everyone in town thought she was.***MAJOR SPOILER*** The very sad ending of the movie has Martha freeing her friend Karen from suffering along with her in being falsely accused of being her lesbian lover by doing herself in. That's after Karen invited her to leave town together with whom she expected to be at that time her future husband Dr. Joe Cardin to a place where no one knows anything about her. Extremely moving final sequence with Karen in tears leaving the funeral of her best friend Martha and totally ignoring those present, who now realized that their actions lead to Martha's suicide, who made life a living hell for both of them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A revelation . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine have delivered consistently impressive performances throughout their careers (Miss MacLaine, still active, still does).In 1961, the year Miss Hepburn made "The Children's Hour," she was nominated for an Academy Award for "Breakfast at Tiffany's." Talk about acting versatility! (Sophia Loren won for "Two Women.") It's enlightening, on so many levels, to revisit "The Children's Hour" from today's perspective, fifty years later.Lillian Hellman's play was written 30 years before THAT: or EIGHTY years ago, from today.Obviously, attitudes about same-sex love have changed in a century, thanks to greater knowledge and human understanding. Yet the self-loathing depicted in "The Children's Hour" -- and yes, the suicide -- are honest for their time. And still today, sadly, in many locales.The script borders on soap-opera cliché and melodrama at times. But eighty years ago these WEREN'T clichés or melodrama. Lesbianism and the murderous prejudice against it (and same-sex love in general) had never been this directly addressed on Broadway before.The "revelation" is in the performances of trite lines that would fall flat and earn snickers in any other actors' hands but these, even in 1961, or under another director / producer than William Wyler. (And note the careful scenic compositions with his cinematographer, Franz Planer.) But it's the acting that packs a wallop. Audrey Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine, Fay Bainter and Karen Balkin as the girl. (Bainter was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.) These really are some amazing performances -- even in light of these actors' OTHER amazing performances. (Except for Karen Balkin, a terrific actress who never became a star.) James Garner is fine. He's not quite on a par with any of the lead women, simply because he can't quite fully inhabit these overwrought lines and situations. His acting chops aren't on the other three leads' level -- not a criticism; just an observation.Though MacLaine and Hepburn can tear your heart out with hackneyed lines like, "I feel so GUILTY (for loving you like that horrid little brat said), and "You're guilty of NOTHING!" . . . James Garner's not so convincing when the script requires him to break down in vulnerable sobs on the mantle in front of stoic Audrey. James Garner, actor, don't cry or do vulnerable so good.But that's fine because he's on the money in every other scene of his. And he always has been.Karen Belkin is wonderful. She goes a little obvious and broad (directed that way?) when she's in the midst of a lie (often), but she's frighteningly threatening in scheming malicious mode (again, often).Miriam Hopkins? Well, she never did quite drop her southern accent birthright completely, despite overlays of theatrical pseudo-British soft-r's. "Have a seat in that chay-ah." What a ham. Still, always watchable.Hepburn, MacLaine and Bainter in particular are consummate screen actors who understand the face, the camera, and underplaying. And, of course, so did Wyler.There are a lot of silences here. A lot of long motionless moments.What these old pros (then young) accomplish here is genuinely heartbreaking, devastating and breathtaking as much for their almost overwhelming acting technique as for the maudlin, dated words and situations they're required to portray.If you've forgotten how brilliant these performers were, and are, "The Children's Hour" is a revelation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subject matter of homosexual and lesbian behaviour should't distract from the universal truths found in the character studies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BEARING False Witness Against Your Neighbor is one of the Commandments that make the cornerstone of our Civilization. As a Community of Believers, we are taught that it is sinful to tell non-truths about our fellow man. As an extension to the Commandment, we are also cautioned about repeating things about another that we don't know to be truthful; or telling stories about one's fellow man which would be unnecessarily harmful to his reputation.THESE are powerful words to live by and we would all be much better off if both the the Spirit, as well as the Letter of the Law were observed.ALL of which brings us to today's subject film; which is the film of the Lillian Hellman play, THE CHILDREN'S HOUR (The Mirisch Corporation, 1961).IN the story, two women (portrayed by Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine), who are partners in an exclusive, upscale and apparently well established boarding-finishing school, are made victims of the willful and wanton spreading of untruthful stories about an "unholy and unnatural" relationship between the two.WITHOUT benefit of any real discussion or even of any open accusation, the two ladies loose their school as a mass exodus of students dries up any of the necessary operating capital. The story also costs the Audrey Hepburn character to lose her plans to marry fiancé, James Garner.AVOIDING telling the story any further; we'll defer the description of any other details to the readers' curiosity.INTERESTINGLY enough the story on screen runs some 147 minutes and yet there is never an instance where the words homosexual or lesbian are spoken. Although it is crystal clear that it is this sort of behavioural pattern which is the subject matter. Perhaps it is due to the time period and the social mores of the times that deigned the restrictive vocabulary that was allowed.ADDING to this is the old Hayes Office standards, which certainly wouldn't stand for that; which when contrasted with the way things are today, seem all to excessive and restrictive, WHEN we get past the homosexual aspect and look at the rest of the story; we can see that here we have a tale about how a smear campaign, be it in print, on the air waves or strictly spoken, can and will ruin a person, The whole idea brings us to thinking of some real life examples that have occurred in recent times.FOREMOST is the story of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. After enduring a long and deeply slanderous hearing before the Senate's Judicial Committee; he received both his Confirmation and word that he was exonerated of any wrong doing. He then asked, "Where do I go to get my good name back?" THE MORAL of the story is: think before you judge and then think twice again before speaking about some one else's life.POODLE SCHNITZ!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Setback Is No Fault of the Filmmakers'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the collective conscious thinks of homosexuality, it thinks only of the sexual aspect of it, which causes a double standard. This could be blamed on the semantics used when describing and discerning it from homosexuality. Gays are said to have "lifestyles" as opposed to "lives," and where straight people are said to have a "moral standard," gays have an "agenda." The more "straight" people mingle and work with, give birth to, and recognize the historically positive results of homosexuals in society, there will be more of a face given to the gay, bisexual, and lesbian community. They will see that they are of the same natural world, doubts, and needs as the rest of us.There was an overwhelming sadness and helplessness in homosexuals in the film's time and place, and the film is a bit of a let-down in that regard. Despite being very well made, it is disappointingly and maddeningly hindered by the ignorance, touchiness, and censorship of the time. It never truly touches on any idea of acceptance of the sort of sexuality, but rather glints with the frustrating social reaction to it and the characters' defense against the malicious gossip.Shirley MacLaine and Audrey Hepburn give wonderful performances as two sweet young teachers who have known each other since they were in school together. They have put together a parochial school for girls in old-fashioned New England. MacLaine's aunt, an aging out of work actress, stays with the two of them, and teaches acting to the girls. Following two years of engagement to a highly regarded gynecologist played by James Garner, Hepburn is at last longing in anticipation for their wedding. An aristocrat's granddaughter is also going to the school. The little girl is a difficult, scheming little brat, intimidating the other girls. Above all, she blackmails poor little Veronica Cartwright, whom she caught at stealing a bracelet.To exact revenge on Hepburn and MacLaine for punishing her for a wrongdoing, the little brat makes up a story about the two women being mixed up in a love affair. Her fabrication is derived from splinters of a tiff between MacLaine and her aunt, which were by chance overheard. The brat tells her grandmother that she saw Hepburn and MacLaine kissing each other. Her grandmother believes her, and without delay notifies the other parents. Consequently, all girls are removed from the school, without giving the two women any reasons. Questioning one father frankly, Hepburn at last gathers the true cause of this abrupt, totally unreasonable and infuriating, action taken by the parents. Through all of this and its aftermath, we are intended to be frustrated by the injustice toward the two teachers in all of this, however the content of the hellish girl's lie is not essentially intended to be perceived as intolerant, or the social reaction deplorable.The buzz is dispersed through the local media, outright devastating the names of the two teachers. No more than James Garner still maintains connection to the two women, MacLaine, who has taken all this a lot harder than Hepburn, place in her care that she, if truth be told, has felt more than camaraderie with her, and, subsequent to listening to the little brat's lie, becomes conscious that she is in love with her. And, though this is done with a lot of feeling and impact as one could well expect from director William Wyler and the pen of Lillian Hellmann, what follows is just not enough. We feel sympathy for her position but the story does not intend for us to necessarily understand it.I don't blame Wyler or Hellmann for this. This film was made during the twilight of the era when Hollywood was still under the repression of the Catholic Legion of Decency. Wyler, in fact, had attempted thirty years before to make an adaptation of Hellmann's play called These Three, but the homosexual element of the plot, the most essential part of it really, was prohibited. Where Hellmann's original play may have succeeded earnestly in its own medium, Wyler did come as close as he could to realizing its full potential on film. If only he had waited another five, ten years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent! Plus, insightful observation of late 50s-early 60s social mores.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We just watched this again last night for the Nth time; as with all excellent films, repeat viewings reveal new insights. For those who may not be aware, this is a remake of the 1936 movie "These Three," and for cinema enthusiasts, it's difficult not to make comparisons between the two -- but I won't here. Suffice to say that, watching either film, one just wants to reach through the screen and shake Mary, the psycho little trouble-maker. It's a chilling portrait of an evil-minded child, almost more so than "The Bad Seed." Both this movie and its predecessor are versions of Lillian Hellman's 1934 stage hit. I strongly urge anyone who enjoyed "The Children's Hour" to view the 1936 version; just one interesting factoid is that Miriam Hopkins, who turns in a brava performance as Martha's flaky (alcoholic?) aunt in this film, originally played the role of Martha in the earlier film, a stupendous casting coup, IMHO.As a child of the 1950's-60's, I am always grateful to have a chance to watch intelligent character studies which reflect the mores of the times, and this one is a stunning example. When I was growing up, male homosexuality was barely hinted at; lesbianism was totally verboten. The mood of the times is beautifully and sensitively reflected in the entire treatment in this screen play. The performances are outstanding. Hepburn and MacLaine need no comment, but I especially appreciated Fay Bainter as the grandmother, a very 'proper' lady of the day; loving her granddaughter, she is both unwilling and unable to see through Mary's quasi-demonic nature, and her apologia scene at the end may be her best on film ever.My only real gripe with this film was its dreadful editing--rarely have I seen such poor work in a film of its stature and pedigree; in some scenes, it's like a record skipping a beat or two. I suspect there was some pressure to shorten the film by a number of minutes, and it mostly occurs in tight scenes between 2 or 3 characters.However, it also bothers me that, in the intro page here, there is no mention of the actual screenwriter. In his post-film recap on TCM last night, Robert Osborne pointed out that Lillian Hellman was unable to rewrite the screenplay because Dashiell Hammett was ill; I am sorry I don't recall the screenwriter's name, but I can state that Osborne said Hellman felt this script was "too close" to her 1934 stage play, and should have gone further. Clearly, she was years ahead of her time, but I can only iterate what I said at the outset -- this film had its finger very much on the pulse of the time (1961).</fullReview>

It must have been quite shocking when it came out in 1961 when you couldn't even use the word pregnant on TV. What I did find upsetting was why Shirley MacLaine's character felt ashamed and dirty for having feelings for another women? Perhaps again it was the sign of the times but I found that disappointing and she got what every 'bad' girl in the movies get, either run over by a car or decides she can't go on living with her dirty little secret. Audrey Hepburn is certainly cast against type yet she gives a very touching performance, as does everyone else involved in this picture.

		<fullReview>A totally misguided attempt at dealing with a social issue that is still a compelling drama even if the trappings are dated. Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine play two women running a private boarding school for girls who find their lives destroyed when one wicked little girl tells a lie that the two teachers are lovers. Fay Bainter plays the concerned grandmother of the girl who quickly removes the girl from school, makes sure the other parents of the students do so as well, and proceeds to ruin the womens' very existence in their small town. The examination of why the allegation of lesbianism can ruin a person's life (or just be seen as so bad a thing) is never even fingerbrushed here, nor is it even stated-everything is worded so carefully it's like you're being told explicitly that this isn't something nice people talk about. On the other hand, Wyler's direction is tight enough and the actresses are so strong that I still find myself with my hands in tight fists by the time the story finally resolves itself. Nothing beats the scene where MacLaine finally lets auntie Miriam Hopkins know what she thinks of her! It's worth watching the film for that alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of a lie to destroy relationships...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main focus of THE CHILDREN'S HOUR is how the power of a lie can destroy meaningful relationships between innocent people and forever change their lives once the lie has spread.And yet, as gripping as Lillian Hellman's play is, this screen version fails to match the intensity and penetrating truths exposed in William Wyler's original version, THESE THREE ('36), so expertly crafted with fine performances by Merle Oberon, Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrea. There the lesbian theme was replaced by a heterosexual scandal and yet the story was no less effective. Wyler knew that the powerful lie was the center of the piece.While I admire Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine for giving sensitive performances here, it is really James Garner who impressed me most of all with what had to be a pretty thankless role. In less sympathetic hands, it might have been a weak spot in an otherwise strong tale. But Garner shows his backbone, integrity and a good sense of humor and makes the character come alive even more so than Joel McCrea was able to do in the '36 version. His natural performance is welcome in a film that has more than a few moments of overly ripe histrionics.And yet, for some strange reason, the film fails to impress as much as the original. Perhaps it's Fay Bainter's melodramatic grandmother that strikes a false note. Or is it Karen Balkin's caricature of a manipulative brat that is in no way as formidable or believable as Bonita Granville's turn in THESE THREE. Balkin tries hard but it seems like an artificial bit of performing. Nor are her schoolmates quite as vividly portrayed as they were in the original film. Miriam Hopkins is fine as the actress aunt who fails to give her niece the moral support she needs during hard times.Lillian Hellman was always an interesting playwright and this is one of her most serious works. Although the presentation is sincere and solemn, it simply doesn't stand up to Wyler's former version of the tale despite the impressive B&amp;W photography and high production values.</fullReview>

While the end does add a Shakespearean element to this story of secrets, manipulation, and doomed love, it suggests that Maclaine's character had to pay the ultimate price for being who she is and deciding to live in truth, momentarily, appeasing a homophobic audience that may have had some sympathy for the pair. Even in 1961, many women, and men, gathered the strength to live openly as lesbian/ gay, even after falling into an abyss of scandal. Shame doesn't have to end with a noose.Shirley MacLaine, by the way, gives one of the greatest performances I've seen on film.</fullReview>

Not only for Shirley Maclaine's fine performance, but the fact that Audrey Hepburn, screen legend and known more for playing romantic comedy leads was in the film. The only film which she plays opposite leading man (James Garner) and female co-star. And they are all brilliant in it. The supporting cast (Miriam Hopkins, Fay Bainter and all the child actors) were great and believable. Well told, brilliantly photographed, beautifully acted and even if it is seen as dated, there's a large part of the story that sill holds true today. Martha's confession scene seems so relatable for many people today as it was back then. Truly this is a film ahead of it's time. I've read reviews from as recent as 3 years ago which have all agreed. This is really classic story telling.</fullReview>

Everyone's reaction came across as "the homosexuals corrupt children", that they are insidious in nature, leading back to homosexuality being a choice. The main characters fought that, if passively, in the implication that Shirley Maclaine had no choice in the matter, as to who she loved. I hold very strongly that the mentality that society pushed at that time, and some still hold onto now, leads to the outcome of the movie. All I've been trying to say is that the movie is still incredibly pertinent after over 50 years, and I would love to see a time when this movie could be written off as just an historical piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1961's The Children's Hour is the second film of Lillian Hellman's play about how gossip and rumor can destroy lives.The play first came to the screen in 1936 as These Three, but this version is a little more faithful to the original play, though still slightly watered down for 1961 movie audiences.This is the story of Karen Wright (Audrey Hepburn) and Martha Dobie (Shirley MacLaine), two teachers who run a private girls' school. Tension between the ladies rises when Karen becomes engaged to a handsome doctor (James Garner) and Martha doesn't take the news very well. After eavesdropping on a conversation between Karen and Martha, a vicious student named Mary (Karen Balkin) starts a rumor that Karen and Martha are lovers, a rumor that reaches Mary's wealthy grandmother (Fay Bainter), a major benefactress of the school who makes sure that the women lose their jobs, even though there is no truth to the rumors. Things get even stickier when it is revealed that Martha really is a lesbian and really in love with Karen, though Karen does not return her feelings. The conflicted feelings of Karen, her fiancée's confusion and Martha's pain of living with this secret all combine to make for riveting drama.The stars are wonderful, with a particularly brilliant turn from MacLaine, who I think was robbed of an Oscar nomination for her performance as Martha. MacLaine is absolutely devastating throughout, especially in the scene where she confesses her true feelings to Karen. MacLaine ripped my guts out in this film and her performance alone makes the film worth watching. It should also be mentioned that Miriam Hopkins, who plays Lily Mortar, played one of the leads in These Three.A surprisingly adult drama that will wreak havoc on your emotions, due to the disturbing story and haunting performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Karen Wright (Audrey Hepburn) and Martha Dobie (Shirley MacLaine) are best friends with their own little boarding school Wright and Dobie School for Girls. Karen is engaged to Dr. Joe Cardin (James Garner) who is the nephew of Mrs. Amelia Tilford. Her granddaughter mean girl Mary Tilford goes to the school. She gets punished by Karen for telling a lie and refusing to admit it. Martha feels abandoned by Karen. Martha's argumentative aunt Lily Mortar accuses Martha of having an UNNATURAL relationship with Karen. Mary's roommates eavesdrops on the argument and tells Mary who in turn tells her grandmother Amelia. To avoid going back to school, she adds even more lies. Talkative aunt Mortar is leaving and adds even more fuel to the fire. The gossip quickly spreads to all the parents.The little girl Mary is so deliciously evil. Young Veronica Cartwright plays the other girl who stole a locket and threatened by Mary. The actors are great although the acting gets very melodramatic. It's also very intense. It doesn't let go. Everybody is just so insanely annoying. It's overwrought and proud of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How I know this is a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been a fan of Audrey Hepburn. Not saying I disliked her work...more I could take it or leave it, depending on the film. Not an actress that would lead me to the theater just because she was in a film.I generally dislike almost any performance by Miriam Hopkins. The one possible exception was when she starred with Bette Davis.I never cared for James Garner, either in the films or on television.Three strikes like that would typically make me simply not attend a film, or turn off the television. But I have watched this film several times, and am always fascinated with it.Audrey Hepburn is brilliant here; mostly an understated performance, and just perfect. Shirley MacLaine is not in a league with Hepburn here, but her performance is very good. James Garner is nigh on perfect in his part as the doctor and fiancé. Miriam Hopkins turns in a dead-on portrayal of a washed up actress and relative whose bitchiness precipitates the crisis.And special mention should be made of the performance by the wonderful Fay Bainter. Sometimes when this film is on TCM, I'll record it and just flip through her scenes. Possibly the best of her career, though certainly not the most lovable. Are you considering going to acting school. Don't bother. Just watch the pro steal every scene she's in...in fact, watch her steal the whole film! A lot has been made of the performances by the two key children actors here. I agree with those who feel that young Karen Balkin's performance was over the top. But, she was a young child. I'll have to criticize Willim Wyler (director) for that. On the other hand, Veronica Cartwright, was perfect as the child-victim.I don't want one to think that based on my last paragraph that William Wyler didn't direct a good film here. One error in judgment shouldn't be taken as an overall criticism. I can count an even 10 films of his that I personally revere (including this one), including his finest -- "Ben Hur".We shouldn't finish without almost praising author Lillian Hellman. Just another of Hellman's brilliant, though dark, masterpieces.This is a movie no serious film-goer should miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whistleblower Lillian Hellman rats out the "fair sex" . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . and gets to the original roots of "hysteria." Her CHILDREN'S HOUR spotlights every wart, from prevarication to perversity, from blackmail to back-stabbing, from kleptomania to clock-teasing, from malingering to maligning, from griping to gullibility, from steamrolling to slander, from harassment to hanging. When you Google "gossip," 89% of the first 200 references are female-related. For 95% of human history--and in much of the world even today--women have no legal standing in court. What we see THE CHILDREN'S HOUR depict on screen could be more aptly titled VICIOUS LITTLE VIXENS or WEE MALICIOUS WITCHES. Young Mary and Rosalie are sociopaths-in-training, under the careful guidance of cold Karen, frustrated Martha, loose-lipped Lily, and credulous Amelia. During their few minutes of involvement with this nut mixture, the men in this story seem mostly embarrassed even to be associated with such poor excuses for human beings. If a guy had written THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, feminists would have tar-and-feathered him as a misogynist. But Ms. Hellman boldly names her most egregious character after herself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrific 1961 remake of 1936's "These Three." Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine are just fabulous as the two victimized teachers of a student's accusations that they're lesbians. This is occurring at a girl's private school.Jim Garner is wonderful and rises to dramatic heights for the occasion portraying the town doctor engaged to the Hepburn character.Faye Bainter, who won the best supporting actress in 1938 as Aunt Belle in "Jezebel," was nominated again in this category as the grandmother who fell for her granddaughter's accusations with all hell breaking out as a result.Lillian Hellman, who wrote the book, wrote something very timely at a time when people were beginning to really question sexual behavior of others.The irony shown at the movie's end is terrific. Shall we say that the accusations may have struck a fatal chord?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Daring as it Could Be in the Early Sixties when the Production Code was Showing Signs of Crumbling, but Only Signs. This was and is a Powerful and Heart Wrenching Story of Sexual Preference and One's Personal Insight to its Manifestation and the Trauma brought on by Societal Persecution and Intolerance.It is Also Lays Out the Profound Damage Done by Accusations (true or not) and the Permanent Stain of Accusual. Even Today the Victims of False Witness are Forever Damaged Even if the Charges are Proved False Beyond Doubt. These Things are Attached and Destroy like a Cancer its Host and the Chance of Recovery is Minimal.Strong Performances are at the Nucleus of the Film's Difficult Subjects, Portrayed with an Intensity and Honesty from the Entire Cast and it All is Remarkably Believable and Touching. The Ending has been Criticized as being too Melodramatic and that it can Send a Mixed Message. But in the Early Sixties this is not Far Fetched and is Nowhere Near a Cop-Out.It is a Scathing, Sometimes Contrived Story that does let a lot of the Threads Off Screen Concerning the Trial, and the Aftermath of the Accusations, but these are Accepted as Necessary for Running Time and the Movie's Limitations. It does not, However, Shy Away from Exposing and Exploring the Personal Sexual Proclivities of the Two Friends and is a Stunning Story from a Time when Hollywood's Restrictions and Reluctance to Approach these Themes was Sacrosanct. It would Take a Cultural Revolution, just a Few Years Away, to Open the Door for More Insight and Inclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-acted At Times But a Memorable Hepburn Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prepare yourself for this film. Because although it is over 50 years old, it still can pull on your heart strings and hit the raw emotional highs you would hope for in a drama. Audrey Hepburn cant do wrong. I absolutely love anything she's in. She has that charisma on screen that demands our attention, similar to Streep and now Jennifer Lawrence. It only comes around every so often. Shirley Maclaine is also very likable in this role as they both play teachers who are accused of being lesbian lovers. For the time that is a daring topic to tackle. Women hadn't even been able to vote for long and our society just hadn't really accepted the gay community. But this movie did a great job at not overdoing it and shoving the conversation in our face. Its really not about teachers at all. It's really the issue of how far one lie can go and how lies can destroy lives.I really loved that they didn't go complete romance with this story. When Hepburn and Garner start talking about marriage it worried me a little bit because there are just so many romantic movies from this era. I appreciate that they went straight drama. Maclaine and Hepburn play well off each other, and I have to say, it was pretty clear from the beginning that Maclaine had something to hide. That kid? Yes very annoying, but did her job. It showed how kids at that age can easily fall into peer pressure, and if you do, you dig yourself deeper and deeper. The small role that Garner had, he was very effective. He was another good compliment to Hepburn. But lets face it, anybody acting with Audrey Hepburn will look 10x as good as they normally do.I only have a few minor complaints. Maclaine I thought over-acted at some points and didn't hit the emotional notes that Hepburn and the kids did. And also at this point in time can you actually lose your students because your lesbian? Wouldn't they have won that court battle for being discriminate? Or was it just because they were co-workers? Could have explained that better.This movie was really good. Mostly because of the late scenes with Hepburn, she sold me on the heartbreak moment. You can totally tell the relationship these co-workers have and it was a great moment on screen. (Hepburn is a good crier).8.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glimpse into a feminine psyche??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Children's Hour" on TCM this evening.It has many thoughtful and excellent reviews so I won't do another one. But I do want to raise another issue which intrigued me.In the scene towards the end i.e. when Karen (played by Audrey Hepburn)repeatedly pushes Joe (played by James Garner) to ask the question whether he ever had any doubt about the nature of her and Martha's (played by Shirley MacLaine) relationship as has publicly come to be known. Joe repeatedly states that he has no such questions. But Karen won't take no for an answer and ultimately succeeds in getting him to ask the question. Then Karen tells Joe that the two women do not have such a relationship, but she still pushes Joe away and viewers are led to believe (esp. in the last scene) that they have parted forever.Later when Martha asks Karen where Joe is as she has made dinner for the three of them, without any hesitation Karen tells her that Joe believed and/or had questions that the two of them (the women) had been in a lesbian relationship. The viewer gets some sense that Martha has guessed what may have happened (that Karen pushed the issue), but the conclusion is ambiguous. To me what was most intriguing is that first Karen virtually browbeats Joe into asking the question whether or not the two women have been in a lesbian relationship. And even after he asks it, and Karen tells him they don't she insists he leave and they break up their relationship, telling him it's for a few weeks.To me this provided an intriguing glimpse into Karen's psyche, that she has resolutely intuited that Joe has this question lurking somewhere in the back of his mind. This is perfectly reasonable to me. She then compels him to ask it, gives him an answer and then breaks their relationship up; later telling Martha that Joe had sought confirmation one way or another about the nature of the two womens' relationship.I can understand Karen intuiting what she does. But I don't see any clarity or reasoning in why Karen is convinced that it requires her to end her relationship with Joe. Or withholding the fact that she was the one to push him to ask the question.If any other reader/reviewer can explain what I am missing here I would very much appreciate that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a taboo needs to be broken!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wyler's second filmic adaption of Lillian Hellman's controversial play THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, the first attempt is THESE THREE (1936), 25 years later, he marshals his favorite girl Hepburn with the blossoming MacLaine to lead the pack and recounts the taboo lesbian tale with a more provocative approach. As an indoor drama with flourishes of false accusations, venomous manipulations, fierce rejoinders, highfalutin buffooneries and affecting confessions among its players, a somewhat gnawing touch of agitation originates from the setup of an evil child (Balkin), whose performance and mien is fiendishly maddening, perhaps it is an intentional option to cast an unappealing girl to magnify the dark side of a child, but if the utter repulsion is the aim, it absolutely scores the bullseye.Unlike in the sensational BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S (1961, 7/10) of the same year, Hepburn strips down to an unostentatious skeleton to portray a woman with unsullied discretion and devoted commitment to her friend, but her pride is too demanding for her spunky fiancé (Garner) to respect, the woman of independence theme runs gloriously in the ending where Hepburn's textbook smile and dignified swanking are emitting gratifying signals both on and off screen. Nevertheless, the obvious and more taxing work is from MacLaine, a closeted lesbian at that time, whose darkest secret has been catalyzed by a contumacious girl's fallacious slander, her confession scenes is one heck of a sensation which persists to impress audiences from generations on. Shamefully, the only acting nomination from the Academy is for the venerable Bainter, who is in every way deserves it and even the win as the moral yardstick at then to reprimand the "unspeakable sin" and becomes the victim of her own (and her granddaughter's) deeds, one may wonder, what will she act if ever she finds out the truth of the story, it's a vivid rendition full of nuances and certainly upgrades her role's credibility from a one-note slant. While Miriam Hopkins is a complete laughingstock here and it is also the big screen debut for the freckle-faced Veronica Cartwright, who can effortlessly give Balkin a good run for her money.In conclusion, Wyler and the team pluckily open the Pandora's box and lay bare the elephant in the room with calculated cautions, THE CHILDREN'S HOUR is a significantly edifying allegory should be seen by as many as us possible, and an essential prerequisite is if you can fast-forward all those scenes with Karen Balken in it (there are quite a few close-ups which overstay their welcome).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed But Compelling Film of Lillian Hellman's Landmark Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly thirty years after Lillian Hellman's first play made its auspicious and somewhat scandalous debut on Broadway, director William Wyler, who had already done a sanitized version in 1936 titled THESE THREE, with the Lesbian plot line changed (by Hellman, no less) to a heterosexual love triangle, decided to revisit the material he had done so successfully before, only this time he restored most of Hellman's original storyline. The results are a bit mixed but mostly successful.By now I think most people who are into film or theatre are familiar with the plot: Karen Wright (Hepburn) and Martha Dobie (MacLaine), two women who run a girls' school in an affluent suburb, are accused of being Lesbians by Mary Tilford (Karen Balkin in one of the brattiest performances ever delivered by a child actress, second only perhaps to Patty McCormack).How Mary gets the idea isn't clear, though she is reading a "forbidden" book at bedtime and she snoops around and sees Karen kiss Martha on the cheek once. Adding to this is the presence of Martha's aunt Lily Mortar (played to a fare-thee-well by the great Miriam Hopkins), an out of work actress who plays around at teaching at the school but spends most of her time irritating her niece while basically contributing nothing.Karen is engaged to Dr Joe Cardin (James Garner), a cousin, oddly enough, of the brat that starts the trouble. Martha tends to get snippy whenever Joe is around, and her aunt Lily, in a couple of long speeches to her niece, accuses her of "unnatural" behavior. And of course Mary overhears it.One day, angry at being punished, Mary runs home to her grandmother (Fay Bainter), who immediately bundles her into the car and heads back for the school. Before they can get there, Mary finally makes the connection between Mrs Mortar's use of the word "unnatural" and the things she has seen and whispers something in Mrs Tilford's ear that horrifies her and makes her turn around and head home. It isn't too difficult to figure out what Mary whispered to her, though it has not yet really been articulated.Upon returning home, Mrs Tilford begins phoning and by the end of the day the Wright-Dobie school is completely barren of students. Both Karen and Martha beg the parents for an explanation, but get nowhere until finally Karen corners one reluctant father who tells her just enough to get her to leave him alone, then hurries off.Karen and Martha, furious, descend on Mrs Tilford's house like a whirlwind, and the whole thing comes out, to coin a phrase. Joe, skeptical by nature, insists on questioning Mary himself despite her grandmother's protests. She sticks to her story, even though she gets caught in one lie regarding a keyhole, which she squirms out of fast.Also staying in the house is Rosalie Wells (Veronica Cartwright), who knows the truth and does not like Mary at all, but whose parents are not at home and she is stuck at the Tilfords' until they arrive. Mary has already taken care of her: she borrowed another student's bracelet and forgot to return it, and Mary has blackmailed her with threats of the police. So when she is questioned, under Mary's glare, she breaks down and corroborates Mary's tale even though she knows it isn't true.Not willing to go down without a fight, the two women sue. And they lose. They are left with nothing and unsure of where to go, since the trial has been in the press.Karen confronts Joe and makes him ask her the question she suspects he's been hiding, and when he does, she sends him away. When she tells Martha, Martha is horrified and tells her to go after him, but she won't. Devastated and guilty, Martha finally, for the first time, articulates the truth: that she does love Karen the way the girl said she did. Karen is heterosexual, of course, but Martha is forced into a confrontation with herself that she cannot deny.Mrs Tilford, meanwhile, discovers that her granddaughter has lied, and makes a desperate attempt to make amends. She is brutally rebuffed by Karen, and Martha breaks into hysterical laughter and runs to her room.I won't reveal the ending. As is usual with Wyler, he is meticulous and everything is in its place. Most particularly the performances of the five main female characters, all of whom are sensational. Garner is his usual stalwart self, which serves the film just fine. My only quibble is that the denouement is stretched out to an interminable length, so that the viewer pretty much knows what has happened before the characters do. I did not agree with this decision, which robbed what should have been a climactic moment of most of its suspense. But this is a minor complaint; for the most part this is a brutally honest and compelling film, beautifully written, acted, and shot, and definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the mouths of babes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's lots to appreciate in this solid, somewhat daring for its time examination of the taboo subject of lesbianism in high society as two likable go-ahead young female teachers (Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine) become the victim of the scandalous accusations of one of their young pupils, but for me somehow it falls short of delivering the effect it should, although I appreciate my expectations of the film might differ from other viewers. I'm familiar with playwright Lilian Hellman's work and read this play as a young man, although I haven't seen the first Hollywood adaptation "These Three" from the late 1930's (although I'd very much like to see how this subject was treated at an much earlier date in the century) so maybe my problem is with the writing and some of its integral plot devices on which the drama hinges, in particular, would a twisted young girl's gossip be taken as gospel by her aged grandmother and by extension every other parent of the children at the accused's school? That same leap of faith is also required for the better-known "The Crucible" by Arthur Miller, so I suppose what's good for one is good for the other...I did wonder how homosexuals then and now might feel about Maclaine's character, who "comes out" in the film, but up to that point seems the tougher of the two women even without the emotional back-up of a loving fiancé James Garner who attends on Hepburn, but who hangs herself at the tragic conclusion - the implication for me is too strong that this is her only way out as a revulsion against her own sexuality which weakens the moral purpose of the film.As a movie, the direction is surely handled by producer / director Wyler who tells his tale well. I could have done without the occasionally over-sentimental background music and a lot of the characters' speeches come across as just that, unsurprisingly given its stage origins. There are some fine directorial touches inserted though, none more so than Hepburn's discovery of MacLaine's body, conveyed with a single anguished look upwards - throughout in fact, great play is made of the extreme close-up shot.On the acting front, MacLaine occasionally goes over the top and comes off less well than Hepburn's dignified epicentre of the piece. James Garner shows convincing pathos as Hepburn's not-quite-strong enough lover although Miriam Hopkin's over-the-top portrayal of MacLaine's harridan aunt somewhat skewers the realism striven for elsewhere. The young girl who plays the horrid accuser Mary is most convincing as she bullies her weaker classmate into supporting her lies. Funnily enough though, as I watched, I wondered about how much more effective the drama may have seemed if the MacLaine and Hepburn roles had been reversed (the subtle inference that the more boyish, less pretty girl has to be the lesbian weakens the premise), ditto the afore-mentioned schoolgirls as scurrilous gossip doesn't just come out of ugly mouths.On the whole this, for me, was a convincing if flawed drama on an adult subject, slightly let down by some of the perceived failings I've indicated above. I did wonder occasionally though what that great tragedian Douglas Sirk (who made his last Hollywood movie around the time this was shot) would have made of this subject matter - in truth perhaps not a great deal more than William Wyler does here, which is to the latter's credit.</fullReview>

How do we move from inspiration to education with such limited treatment of the real subject? I found this script to be alarming in that it was as unexpected as Shirley's discovery.

		<shortDescription>The power of lies, the depths of suspicion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the finest films to come out of Hollywood in the early 1960s, and will remain a permanent classic, despite the social changes which have taken place since then. Directed with breathtaking brilliance by William Wyler for MGM, the film features intense and harrowing performances by Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine as the two young women who have been friends since they were 17 and who now run a private school for girls in New England. The film is based upon a famous play of the same title by Lillian Hellman, her first play in fact, which was first produced on Broadway in 1934. During the 1960s, when this film was so controversial, especially in light of the Oscars it won, it was in some commercial markets renamed THE LOUDEST WHISPER, to remove the reference to children in the original title, which was considered too provocative. The film deals with lesbianism, not even overt lesbianism, but 'closet lesbianism', i.e. where a close friendship between two young women which was purely Platonic in practice had sensual overtones of which they themselves had been unconscious. Or, as it is described by MacLaine when she speaks of the offense of which they have been falsely accused by a disturbed child in their school: 'We have been accused of having had unlawful sexual knowledge of one another!' Seeing this film today, when lesbianism is practically being taught in schools to five year-old girls and offered to them as a 'life-style choice' by their teachers with state approval, the social mores portrayed in this film appear nearly as mediaeval as those of present-day Saudi Arabia, and yet what we see is a picture of the United States as it really was before what is known as 'the sexual revolution' of the 1960s swept all before it in a tidal wave of hedonism. Wyler managed to take a story of the 1930s and transplant it successfully to circa 1960, but that was just about the last year when this would have been possible. The fact that this film is now obsolete as a social commentary on our current times in no way destroys its value. One might as well say that no one should read Melville's MOBY DICK anymore because of the decline of whale hunting, or that Chaucer is irrelevant because people do not go to Canterbury on pilgrimages these days and hence the stories told by a group of pilgrims on their way to Canterbury 'have no relevance to the modern world'. Indeed there is a permanent chorus of fools crying that nothing made, written or filmed before today has any relevance to that vast, and I must say crumbling, edifice, which in our pride we call 'the modern world in which we live'. Education in the West today steers away from 'classics' and tries to deal with 'relevance', narrowly defined as something which happened no less than five minutes ago and has no context. (The memory span of twenty-somethings today often seems to extend no further back than the last text message received on a portable electronic device.) As if human dramas of any age were irrelevant! As if we could navigate towards any future at all if we know nothing of the past whatever! I recently saw the stage revival of THE CHILDREN'S HOUR in London, where the two young women were played by Keira Knightley (the Hepburn role) and Elizabeth Moss (the MacLaine role). They were both upstaged by the unknown young actress playing the psychotic girl, and also by Ellen Burstyn as the grandmother. In the film, the most intense and remarkable performance is probably that of Fay Bainter as the grandmother. She 'knocks the socks off' Hepburn and MacLaine and shows what an old pro can really do when given the chance. And the psychotic girl played by Karen Balkin in the film is so scary, anyone would want to run from her. I have the script of the play, and the stage directions of Act One state: 'Seven girls, from twelve to fourteen years old, are informally grouped on chairs and sofa.' In the recent London revival, the girls were even older. But in the film, they are made much younger, approximately eight years old. This works in terms of the film, and intensifies the hysteria to an extraordinary degree. The screenplay, on which Hellman herself worked, concentrates the drama greatly, and the film is a far superior work than the play could ever be onstage. It rearranges the structure of the narrative, and thus greatly improves it. Nearly the entire first act of the play is chopped to bits and reinserted elsewhere in the story, which makes things work much better. It also eliminates the strange and unsatisfactory dichotomy of the play, whereby the first act is so dominated by the girls to the exclusion of the two young women that one wonders what the real story is, and who the main dramatic protagonists really are. In other words, the structure of the play itself is deeply flawed, and this fault was remedied for the film. Hellman's underlying message in this play is thus really the story of 'the power of the lie to destroy', or perhaps more properly, 'the power of whispers to destroy'. In this, she was highly prescient and it is as if she were anticipating the McCarthyism of the 1950s. Hellman was a member of the American Communist Party. I know this because when I was sorting the unpublished papers of the late James Agee many years ago, before they went to the University of Texas, I came across one autobiographical page in which he described attending a Communist Party meeting in Manhattan, at which Hellman was present, and he specifically stated that she was a Party member (whereas he never was). But in this early play, she was probably referring indirectly to the ominous rise of Fascism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly perfect and it manages to be better than the original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I hate remakes....absolutely hate them. However, in the case of "These Three" we have a peculiar situation. While this original film was wonderful (I gave it a 9 in my review), the film was incredibly sanitized because of the very restrictive Production Code. All hints at lesbianism were removed from the script and the film was purely about the way a lie snowballs and hurts many people. It was exceptional...but completely missed the gay angle. Well, by 1961, the Production Code was still in place (barely) but standards had changed and so had the enforcement of the Code. For example, in "The Apartment" (also with Shirley MacLain but made the year before), the main theme was adultery--something that NEVER would have been approved back in the 1930s when "These Three" was made...and if they wouldn't allow a theme involving adultery, they certainly would NOT have allowed even a hint of lesbianism. Now this is NOT to say that "The Children's Hour" doesn't also hold back (after all, the words 'lesbian' or 'homosexual' are never used), it strongly implies so much and goes so far as to say that the two women were being accused of being lovers--a very modern theme! Now I am sure some today may hate the film--as it could be construed as either pro- or anti-gay---I just admire its frankness for 1961.Audrey Hepburn and MacLaine play best friends who co-run a small boarding school for rich young ladies. MacLaine's aunt (Miriam Hopkins--who starred in the original film) works for them and is frankly of no help at all--she's self-centered and very histrionic. In this school there is one girl in particular who is a budding sociopath--she lies, is vicious and shows no evidence of any conscience. One day, after being caught and rebuked for lying, she then concocts a vicious lie and tells it rather masterfully to her gullible grandmother (Fay Bainter). The grandmother investigates and talks with Hopkins--who says many unwise things that are misconstrued by the grandmother as confirmation of her granddaughter's story. In response, she contacts all the parents who then remove all the kids from the school because of the accusations. No one even has the decency to ask the two teachers if it is true--they just sanctimoniously remove their kids (wow, that's enlightened!).When the child is confronted for her lies, she continues lying and manages to make her grandmother side with her when the girl blackmails another child to confirm her crazy accusations about the teachers kissing and carrying on an affair in front of the students. When the teachers sue, the selfish Aunt doesn't even bother to show up to court and the judgment goes against them. As a result, Helburn's relationship with her fiancé (James Garner) is a mess--as is her relationship with her friend (MacLaine). This leads to a conclusion with MANY great twists--but I won't say them here because it really would spoil the film. However, I loved how the film did NOT stop where "These Three" stopped but had a very emotional and tragic finale that, frankly, made it a better film. I'd score them both 9 (I can't give "The Children's Hour" a 10 because it still pulled a few punches).Some standouts in the film were MacLaine and Hopkins. Now I am NOT saying Hepburn was bad, but her part didn't give her as much chance to show off her acting abilities--it was very straight-forward and less complex. MacLaine, however, was brilliant. Her facial expressions and body language were great and she said a lot in many scenes where she actually said nothing out loud. Also, Hopkins managed to play a lady who was so easy to hate--she managed to play a self-centered and highly affected lady so well. I hate to say this, but I saw a documentary in which cast from the film talked about making this movie and apparently Hopkins pretty much played herself! Seriously. By the time the film was complete, everyone apparently hated her and the experience was NOT a positive one. But it also brought out some terrific tension in the film.Another standout was the masterful director, William Wyler. He directed both versions, but I liked the slow and deliberate way it was filmed (it could have been about 15 minutes shorter with another director) and I loved the composition. A lovely film from start to finish--and one well worth seeing. And, I must say, that I'd love to see this incredible Lillian Hellman story redone one final time--as nowadays you could say and do ANYTHING in the film! Heck, you could even add necrophilia or cannibalism if you'd like!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie for the first time and all I have to say is "Wow." That movie broke the barriers of censorship during the earlier 1960's. Sure you will hear an occasionally phrase like "hell" or "damn" but when it involves homosexuality that really took a huge risk on the movie screen.I was impressed that Miriam Hopkins plays the auntie in this remake even though she plays as one of the teacher in the original movie which it was named "These Three" with Merle Oberon.If anyone who saw "These Threes" it's the same exact plot of Children's Hour unfortunately they had to make it a love triangle between two teachers and a doctor instead of lesbianism.I will have to give the producers and directors props for showing that movie in 1961.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Children's Hour was good because it shows how homosexuality was unaccepted by society in those times. It was so unaccepted that the end result was tragic for one of the characters. I think it's a good movie for people to become more accepting of other lifestyles. It's not my favorite Audrey Hepburn movie, but it definitely makes you think about judging other people. It is a drama, unlike some of other Audrey's movies. If you are looking for a movie with such a plot, The Children's Hour is the way to go. If happy comedies are your thing, avoid this movie. I give it a seven out of ten. Also, if anyone can tell me why it's called The Children's Hour, please respond to my message on The Children's Hour board.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story (without giving away too much) is about school teachers Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine who run a girls school, and their lives are completely ruined by the lies of a little girl Mary (Karen Balkin). As everything they planned and everything they've achieved is taken away from them, more drama unfolds...I'm a huge fan of Audrey Hepburn (who isn't?), and because I saw 'How to steal a million' also directed by William Wyler, I was expecting to see another typical Audrey Hepburn movie. I was so desperately wrong, but I enjoyed the movie all the same. The real heroin is not Audrey Hepburn, though she is billed first, it is MacLaine, playing the school teacher with a dark secret (I won't say it, IMDB probably won't let me anyway).Hepburn is understated, and decided unglamourous for a change. Shirley MacLaine impressively portrays the augmenting melancholy with authority. The cast that includes James Garner as Hepburn's fiance and Veronica Cartwright as Rosalie (Lambert in 'Alien') is uniformly fine. William Wyler's direction is beautiful, and some neat touches, like focusing on the eyes of Mary, and showing the shadow of the noose as Hepburn frantically runs upstairs.All in all a fine drama, but, nah, I rather watch My Fair Lady.</fullReview>

Karen had a boy friend, James Garner( Dr. Joe Cardin),"Maverick",'94, who was engaged to Karen for two years and were going to get married and have children. However, a child seemed to make up a story about the relationship between Karen and Martha which created a complete disaster to their lives. Fay Bainter,(Mrs. Amelia Tilford),"Close to My Heart",'51 gave a great supporting role as a very rich lady, and unfortunately this veteran actress made her swan song with this picture. There are great lessons to be learned from this film, Love is very powerful and should be respected no matter what people will say about your sexual relationship.

		<shortDescription>Dated, somewhat clichéd but daring for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About a year ago, I remember seeing `These Three', the film The Children's Hour is based on. Both films deal with a scandal that brings down all of the characters involved, and both contain hideously screeching young girls, one who could be a sibling of the `Demon Seed' and another who is pathetically spineless and unwittingly seals the fate of people she admires and likes.*Spoilers within*The Children's Hour features a very stoic and serene Audrey Hepburn as Karen, who along with Martha, a high-strung and emotional woman played by Shirley MacLaine, found an exclusive boarding school for girls. They struggle from the start, but manage to attract a group of rich, privileged little girls - most of whom are compliant and harmless with the notable exception of a spoiled rotten child, Mary. By the time the school actually makes a tiny profit, Mary decides that she's had enough of being treated like everyone else and in a bid to get out of the school, tells her rich and influential grandmother, whose nephew Dr. Joe (James Garner) is about to marry Karen, that Karen and Martha are in love `that way' and are not hiding it from the students. The accusations swiftly bring down the school as well as the reputations of the two women and Dr. Joe who is guilty by association. The three sue unsuccessfully for libel, further damaging their standing and further edging them into financial ruin.The most glaring difference between this film and its predecessor is the introduction (or omission) of lesbianism between Karen and Martha. In `These Three', the `scandal' was that there was a love triangle among the two women and fiancée, but the women were in love with the man. In The Children's Hour, the word `lesbian' is never used, but Martha proclaims to Karen that she does indeed love Karen `that way'. It is not completely clear what Karen's final thoughts on the matter are - it is left fairly open to interpretation, but what is clear is that while being commendable and daring for introducing the hint of homosexuality in a mainstream film starring one of Hollywood's most beloved actresses, they fall into the cliché that the ONLY result of these feelings, unrequited or not, is going to be tragedy. Hollywood was not ready to be that progressive at that point, and really wasn't for another thirty years, but it is daring enough to still be relevant and noteworthy nonetheless.If you can put up with some histrionics, a bleak story and a couple of jarringly overdramatic children, it is more than worth it to watch this film. It is good, but not great yet is powerful and compelling enough to still garner a fairly strong reaction.--Shelly</fullReview>

It was too bad they didn't show of the two teachers kissing, it really was very backward in those days! It would've made a difference to Hollywood and open up a lot more but instead, everything shouldn't be talked about. It was such a disgrace then.I was so upset that Martha killed herself because of the fact, she couldn't have Karen and everyone just isolated them.

		<fullReview>The Children's Hour tackled a subject that was a taboo at it's time and is still relevant today. (I'm quite sure not many parents would appreciate a lesbian couple as headmistresses in an all-girls boarding school now, not even in my home country Germany with her relatively liberal attitude towards homosexuality.) Though I don't think the film is outright bad, it still has considerable flaws. The dialog is occasionally stiff and stilted, and the direction quite heavy-handed. Some of the plot elements seem completely unbelievable, such as Karen's decision to leave her fiancée, just because he has h a d an - understandable - shadow of a doubt. Also the film very much shows its origination in a stage play with only few but overly long and talky scenes - especially the one at Fay Bainter's home. Some of the characters seem one-dimensional to the point of caricature. Mary is so vicious and vicious-looking that nobody in his or her right mind would ever believe her. Especially unbelievable is her Grandma - who is aware of her grandchild's questionable character - and the others not noticing when Mary is pressuring Rosalie into confirming her lie. The acting is a mixed bag: Audrey Hepburn seems on autopilot with her constant soft, sweet demeanor and James Garner is utterly colorless. I contrast Miriam Hopkins' over-the-top turn is fun to watch and she steals every scene she's in (she has her best scene in the beginning when she is "conducting" the two piano-playing girls). Fay Bainter gets credit for lending some subtlety to a role that doesn't allow for much. But Shirley MacLaine is the best of all and adds a spark of modernity and spirit to the film, and she can't be blamed for the over-the-top scenes at the end, they're in the script. All in all the film feels at least ten years older than it is and the subject has been tackled much better before (especially in the excellent German movie "Mädchen in Uniform" ("Girls in Uniform") from the early thirties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rate this a good movie 7/10. Hepburn, MacLaine, and Bainter really made a quality act. The flaw, although not major, was still an eye roller. When the spoiled Mary Tilford was interrogated and found lying about witnessing romantic acts by the two teachers, she claimed it was her classmate Rosalie who actually saw everything and then told her about it. Keep in mind that sweet Rosalie was not even aware of the allegations about the teachers, much less detailed information. Also, Mary knew a secret of Rosalie's and threatened that if she didn't do Mary's bidding, she would spill the secret. So now Rosalie is questioned (in front of Mary instead of separately) and the questioners actually relate to Rosalie details about what she was suspected of seeing before they actually ask her if she saw it. She denies knowing about it until Mary glares and yells at her to admit she saw it. She then breaks down crying and says she did see it happen. Now, imagine if Rosalie had instead been questioned out of Mary's presence, and without filling her in on the facts first. There is no way she could admit to having seen something she knew nothing about. Write Lillian Hellman adapted her novel for this movie. And William Wyler is a great director, so I really am surprised they both let this unfold the way they did. All in all, though, a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Children's HourThe best way to keep your lesbian relationship secret is by telling everyone you're sisters.The lovers in this drama, however, choose to deny their passions outright.When a spiteful private school student spreads rumors that her teachers, Martha (Shirley MacLaine) and Karen (Audrey Hepburn), are lesbians, she puts Karen's engagement to Joe (James Garner) as well as both women's careers in jeopardy.As the validity of the allegations is scrutinized by the faculty so too do both women explore their own feelings for each other. But the shame for one is too much to bear.One of the first, and few, Hollywood movies to discuss homosexuality, this 1961 film adaptation of the infamous play is a well-acted think piece that cunningly expounds on the dangers of gossip.Besides, the best way to tell if a female teacher is a possible lesbian is by having them teach a gym class.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director William Wyler's lugubrious redoing of his own "These Three" from 1936 stars Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine as teachers who run an all-girl school; when a despicable youngster spreads a rumor about the two, nosey biddies start a witchhunt. Sadly, even in 1961, homosexuality was an extremely touchy subject for the movies, and the film shows that times had yet to catch up with Lillian Hellman's original play (Audrey says the word 'lovers', but we never hear 'lesbians'). Fascinating that Hepburn followed up her fashionable triumph in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" with this unglamorous soaper, which is overstated in all the wrong ways and yet timid where it shouldn't be. Wyler manages some effective sequences, and Hepburn and MacLaine are both good under the circumstances--which feel tampered with, watered down. As Audrey's beau, James Garner has far less to work with, his lethargic character rarely becoming active in the proceedings. The beady-eyed child at the center of the story is rather awful; yes, she does a good job at making you dislike her, but perhaps a more conniving, ambiguous little schemer might've added some compelling subtext. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a piece of misguided hooey this movie was.Right off the bat, let's change out one of the actresses to say it is a man and a woman who are running the girls school and now that woman is engaged to someone else.A little girl tells rumors about the two people actually being lovers.Totally shifts the entire focus of how it would be perceived, doesn't it? And now along the lines, the man running the school admits he really is in love with the woman engaged to the other fellow.Would he then kill himself? Was she denying any love she might have had for him? Any criticism for the film is clearly dismissed as being homophobic, case closed.There was no reason for MacLaine's character to kill herself as she did, gay or straight, and regardless of how *SOCIETY* (which using this term as something that has to be challenged is a major cop-out) may view her.I've not seen the original, but gather it takes a similar stance of what I proposed, but that was two women for one man.If the gossip spread the woman was marrying one man while she was having midnight liaisons with the other, we could follow the notion a pristine townsfolk could object to the pre-marital behavior going on at the school, even if it were hetero.This movie tried too hard to make the focus on the three persons involved, Hepburn, MacLaine and Garner. In truth, there seemed to be no focus on them, especially Garner.And it would actually have been better had Hepburn accused Garner of wondering if what the little girls said was true.And what about those little girls? The one who played Mary was dreadful, beyond dreadful. If anyone believes this little girl's behavior was a good representation of today's ideology of a hate crime, then congratulations, you are truly deluding yourself.Bainter and Hopkins were about the only characters worth following in this mess.When Garner and Hepburn were talking, I was bored to tears, same for Hepburn and MacLaine's dialogue. I've never seen such a flipped-over movie in my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She makes "Bad Seed" Rhoda look like Shirley Temple.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first moment you see Karen Balkin in this second film version of the classic Lillian Hellman play, you can tell something is off. Not with the young actress, but with the character. She is instantly up to something, and you don't trust her immediately. She's beyond temperamental, obviously not spoiled by her wealthy grandmother (Fay Bainter), but certainly intent on getting her own way in everything. Sent off to the new boarding school just opened by life-long friends Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine, Balkin's Mary is obviously resentful and sets out to make everybody's life a living hell. She has no qualms about blackmailing a roommate ("Lost in Space's" Veronica Cartwright) for stealing a necklace to go along with her plan to ruin the two ladies and shows definite signs of violence. Unlike Patty McCormick's subtle Rhoda in the earlier "The Bad Seed", you see through her immediately, and cheer when Uncle James Garner shows up as a doctor and gives the tantrum prone child a painful smack in the behind for causing problems. Rhoda in "The Bad Seed" was made to be more sinister because she was a demon child lurking behind manners and physical beauty.What is Mary's lie? It is something so vile that it is surprising that a child could ever put two and two together to come up with lesbianism. This isn't a play about lesbianism; It is a play about libel and how gossip can destroy lives. No matter your stance on homosexuality in any form, you can't help but feel disgusted that an adolescent child could be consumed with so much hate she would take things to the level that she does. Obviously Mary isn't as much shocked by what she hears MacLaine's pain in the rear aunt Miriam Hopkins tell her, only more delighted that she has gotten some leverage on two people who really do care about her. There's nothing comical about this character as there would be when Allison Arngrim's equally nasty character Nellie Olsen caused trouble for "Little House on the Prairie's" Laura Ingalls on TV over a decade later. Nellie would reform in later years; you get the real impression that Mary here is going to grow up to be even more sinister because she shows absolutely no remorse when her lie causes every parent of a student to pull them out, ostensibly closing the new school even before it completed its first year.Critically, this version of the play is not as praised as its earlier non-lesbian version, "These Three", in which two friends were both rumored to be in love with the same man. Ironically, Miriam Hopkins from that version is here, cast in the unfortunate role of the hated aunt whose indiscretions get into the child's ears to create the trouble which ruins all the lives in the first place. Hopkins hams it up to the point of becoming a a cartoon character at times. It is Fay Bainter as the troubled grandmother who wins acting honors here, showing emotional turmoil as she accepts the lie and realizes how it will destroy lives. Earlier, having defended the teachers to her granddaughter, you see she is not one to just give her granddaughter the benefit of the doubt, and this adds a true reality to her performance.MacLaine and Hepburn both give layered performances, but they are more reactors to the situation which is destroying their lives as opposed to having the power to correct things. As "victims", they become pathetic, and sadly, MacLaine's character is revealed to be so sad inside her cold shell which shakes her to the core. You see the rigid sexless young woman as not only wounded but one who considers herself a freak yet can't escape who she really is underneath. This dates the play terribly, and if revived today, it would have to be explained that this is a "period" piece even if set in the 20th Century. William Wyler, who has directed several adapt ions of Hellman's plays (including the original 1936 version), doesn't fully succeed in making this as gripping as it could be. Perhaps that is because the character of Mary is so garish in how she is presented rather than the subtlety that Bonita Granville had with the original cleaned up version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good screen adaptation of the Lillian Hellman play.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a good but not great screen adaptation of the Lillian Hellman play. The movie does a good job with sticking with the story. The problem is the cast. The performances by Audrey Hepburn and James Garner are so stagy that it almost undoes the movie. The movie is saved by the powerful and compelling performances by Karen Balkin as Mary the student who starts the rumor and Shirley MacLaine as the teacher who is one of the victims. The tension between these two characters keeps the story from going stale. The movie itself is filmed almost as a stage play, which in this case works, since the story is character-driven. James Garner is completely upstaged by the female cast, and the scene in which he confronts Mary, which is supposed to be climactic, is weak. Now, one could dismiss this story as being contrived, but it isn't. Guilt by innuendo is nothing new, and this movie dramatizes the catastrophic consequences of such vicious behavior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A devious student at an all-girls school begins a rumor that two teachers are lesbians, which leads to personal and professional tragedy. Certainly a film ahead of its time with plot, but dated in some aspect and overly acted by child actress Balkin. Filmed before by Wyler as These Three (1936), both based on a play by Lillian Hellman. *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fay Bainter (Mrs. Tilford) looked/acts reptilian in her adieu scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EYE (sic) must need to get my eyes examined! In Mrs. Amelia Tilford's final scene, where she visits the two main characters/teachers, her skin appeared at first very reptilian/"scaly." It's only when I realized she had a veiled hat that didn't appear to show in contrast below her face and dark dress (in a B&amp;W film) that I realized such scaliness wasn't her natural, old-age complexion! Maybe I need a higher-def tube to view the flick on, but I was so amused/alarmed at first by Fay's wrinkles appearing like a reptilian dermis. It was only in scenes after her close-up that I realized it wasn't (OR WAS IT???) a director's intent to have chameleon skin. Her last scene was rather chameleon (she needed to apologize for listening to kids' rumors which she acted upon to eventually have the school shut down and Shirley and Audreys' reputation ruined). Nice hat trick, Mrs. Tilford, but it didn't work because of past generations' shame against gays, lesbian and other "loves that dare not speak their names").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Big Hissy Fit of a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine star as fellow teachers in a girls' school, and the targets of malicious gossip by one of the students, in this William Wyler remake of his own 1936 film, "These Three," both based on the Lillian Hellman play.This updated version is more faithful to Hellman's play and is meant to be much more shocking. The little girl spreads rumors that the two teachers are involved in a lesbian relationship, though the word "lesbian" is never stated outright. Complicating matters is the fact that MacLaine's character actually does harbor lesbian tendencies, and does have feelings for Hepburn, even though she's got the hots for James Garner. Wyler wants us to take all of this very seriously, and he deserves credit for tackling a subject like homophobia and the hysteria it can produce before it was vogue to do so. But something gets lost in the translation. The movie feels over-emphatic and teeters on the brink of silliness, and the ending especially, with its doomsday music and shadowy lighting, comes across as very heavy handed, an unusual complaint about this usually reliable and sensitive director.Veronica Cartwright cries and slobbers her way through an early role as one of the children; she's as unwatchable as ever. Character actress Fay Bainter blusters her way imperiously through the film as grandmother of the hateful little brat who starts the whole thing. Hers is the only performance that solidly lands where it's supposed to.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miriam Hopkins Saves The Day -- again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've ever seen These Three (1936) note that it is the far better version of The Children's Hour. (1961) Both are film versions of the controversial play by Lillian Hellman.Of course back in 1936 they had to make sneaky with the lesbianism by tossing it and adding in a heterosexual love triangle. This 1961 version leaves the homosexual undertones pretty much intact, albeit with 1960s sensibilities -- Martha is stereotypically pathetic, lonely and bitter.Nice job by MacClaine (Martha Doby), a little shrill but actually quite good. She holds up pretty well even when she is put up against Miriam Hopkins -- and that ain't easy. Hopkins is quite possibly one of the greatest actresses of all time and she deftly takes over this film playing the oddly difficult part of the mooching Aunt Lily.Film buffs will note that Miriam Hopkins played MacClaine's part in These Three. She ruled that movie too. I think she may be the only actress to ever steal the show in a remake while at the same time playing a different part.Audrey Hepburn is wooden and terribly miscast in here. They don't bounce much dialogue between Hepburn and Hopkins because the director was smart enough to know that Hepburn could not keep up with Hopkins both in manner and nuance. Hopkins is pretty much on her own and that's as it should be.James Garner (Dr, Cardin) is annoying and he adds nothing to the film.Faye Bainter (Mrs. Tilford) offers up a flawless performance. Her encounter with Miriam Hopkins in the hallway of the school is classic cinema and is one of the reasons why this film is worth watching.So, Miriam Hopkins saves the day and makes this movie a watchable classic. If you don't know anything about Miriam Hopkins, take a look-see at some of her work, especially the original version of The Children's Hour (when it was called These Three). You will see that she owned the camera. That's why a lot of people didn't like her.Damien</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead of its time...but very dated now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two teachers (Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine) have their lives destroyed when an evil child wrongfully accuses them of being lesbians. This was pretty strong stuff in 1961 (in fact, the word "lesbian" is never even uttered!) but it doesn't date well. The reactions of people in this movie seem way overdone and the script can't overcome the fact that is was based on a stage play--I expected to see a curtain descending halfway through the movie! Also a crucial trial sequence was cut out by the studio before the film was released, so there's a big "hole" in the middle. However, the cinematography of Franz Planer is beautiful...the imagery tells you exactly what characters are thinking without a word of dialogue.The acting varies--Hepburn is too mannered (and seems very uncomfortable) and James Garner (as her boyfriend) walks through his role. However MacLaine is excellent (especially at the end) as is Miriam Hopkins (as a meddling aunt) and Fay Bainter (Oscar-nominated as a concerned parent and the main villainess).The main problem, as I said before, is the script. It's too damn stagy! Most of it sounds unrealistic. Also hated the tragic ending (but that's the only way it could end in its era). So, it was a trailblazer in terms of gay representation on the screen but (unfortunately) it doesn't hold up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Eye of the Beholder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoiler Alert***I watched this film for the first time last night. It was very late already and I was preparing for bed. But once I started watching, I couldn't turn it off. So I watched until the end, which didn't come until after 3:00 AM. I was so fascinated that there was a film back at that time that dealt with homosexuality in such an open and candid way. I watched, eager to see how this all played out. Surely there was dialogue that seemed disturbing by today's standards as it conveyed a message that homosexuality was something shameful and wrong. But the concluding moments of the film, with Martha's acknowledgment of her sexual identity, spoke truthfully of the personal torment and fear homosexuals did struggle with at that time, due to the bigotry then so pervasive in society. And with her ultimate suicide, the message seemed loud and clear: this is where an intolerant, narrow-minded and ignorant society leads, and it should be ashamed.I wondered about the water cooler conversation at that time surrounding this movie. Did people begin to understand and discuss the fact that people don't choose to be homosexual, and the cruelty of society's intolerance of homosexuality? It seemed like a conversation starter for a subject that had not been addressed before. But when I woke up this morning, an entirely different thought occurred to me: 1961 was twelve years before the APA decision to declassify homosexuality as a mental illness. People, by and large, still perceived it as such. So having Martha commit suicide fit well with that notion: homosexuality and suicidal tendencies are, as many believed, both rooted in mental illness. That, plus the fact that Martha concluded her life believing her homosexuality was wrong perhaps did nothing to move the ball forward and only reinforced the ignorance and prejudices of the era. So what on the surface may have seemed like a bold and progressive film may have actually been just the opposite. I give the film high marks for superior acting and photography, but low marks for the convoluted message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The loudest whisper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Known in the UK under the more evocative title The Loudest Whisper, The Children's Hour is director William Wylers second filming of Lillian Hellman's stage play. Filmed in 1936 as These Three, The Children's Hour was released in 1961 with a screenplay by John Michael Hayes, whose credits include Torch Song, Rear Window, Butterfield 8, The Carpetbaggers and Where Love Has Gone. Perhaps daring in its day, The Children's Hour is a heavy handed drama that is far from Wyler's best, and Pug-faced Karin Balkin who plays the villainous Mary is so obviously manipulative that it's impossible to believe any adult would be taken in by her. James Garner and Audrey Hephurn are dull and Miriam Hopkins chews the scenery. Wyler, who directed Hephurn to an Oscar in Roman Holiday, gets good performances from Shirley Maclaine, Veronica Cartwright(The Birds, Alien, Witches of Eastwick) and Fay Bainter, who received an Oscar nod for supporting actress. Poorly paced film is dirge-like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly melodramatic tripe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very surprised when I watched this movie recently....normally I am a big fan of William Wyler. But I actually thought this movie was bad, pretty much from start to finish, but especially the way the story ends. The characters were overly melodramatic, as if emotion equals good acting. I also thought the story was very clichéd. A child makes up a lie, and it causes great damage to lives. There was at best, a half-hearted attempt to investigate and / or repudiate the lie. The story focused rather on the effects the lie had on adult lives. But to be a good story, things have to make sense, and this one does not. I was a young teen when this movie was made, so I am familiar with the attitudes and mores of the times. Yes, things were different in 1961, but people still investigated serious accusations. By the time the truth comes out, self pity has overcome the leading characters, and they are poor examples of how to react in a situation. Basically, I just thought more could have been done with the premise, rather than have the characters simply give in to the personal destruction that resulted from the lie. Simplistic and moralistic, without being thoughtful or insightful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, the story is one thing. Probably shocking when the play was written in the 30's, a little less so in the 60's when this movie was made, it's just ridiculous to watch today.Lesbians! They're lesbians! They say they're not lesbians, but a little girl says they are so they must be...well...lesbians! The holes in the plot are about a million miles wide.But it's the acting that gets me. Audrey Hepburn acquits herself, but Shirley MacLaine is histrionic at best and James Garner seems to have no idea what he's doing there. Most of his notes are false. Fay Bainter's character is ridiculous though she makes the most of it. Miriam Hopkins is OK, but winds up taking a thankless role and doing very little with it.But really, this movie is such an anachronism, and so full of ridiculous relationships and decisions that it's best seen as a comedy.I like what Bosley Crowther of the New York Times said about it and mind you, this is what he said back in 1961: "IT is hard to believe that Lillian Hellman's famous stage play, "The Children's Hour," could have aged into such a cultural antique in the course of three decades as it looks in the new film version of it that came to the Astor and the Trans-Lux Fifty-second Street yesterday.But here it is, fidgeting and fuming, like some dotty old doll in bombazine with her mouth sagging open in shocked amazement at the batedly whispered hint that a couple of female schoolteachers could be attached to each other by an "unnatural" love."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Acting; Badly Dated Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was released when I had just started high school; because it was scandalous and risqué at the time and was not considered a "date" movie, I missed seeing it. Thank goodness! As a teenager just beginning to deal with my gay sexuality, I probably would've committed suicide or, at best, stayed in the closet for the rest of my life. Curious about it, I watched it for the first (and last) time recently on Turner Classic Movies. The acting is excellent; particularly Shirley MacLaine and Fay Bainter. Evil Little Mary, although obviously not copied from "Rhoda" in "The Bad Seed" (Hellman's play predates "The Bad Seed" by several years), is just as conniving and hateful. However, the lesbian undertones are now preposterously dated. Yes, it probably is more or less true to the "times" (when gay characters always committed suicide at the end of the movie), but such angst and self-loathing have no place in today's society. I demoted my vote by about 4 stars because of the tragic ending. Most movies from the Sixties of this ilk (The Sergeant, Reflections in A Golden Eye, The Fox, Boys in the Band, etc. come to mind) are laughable now for gay viewers. Put them back on the shelf in the closet where they belong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This peppy little number is Vito Russo's Exhibit A in the book/movie The Celluloid Closet, and as such I tried to cut it some slack, coming at it as a movie and a narrative rather than a harbinger or a tract. Yeah that clip of Shirl hatin' on her own closeted sexuality was total bug-eyed over the top, and cemented the only permissible attitude toward queers in Hollywood for about a quarter century; but of course the doc removed some context and complication from the whole work; I don't blame Gram Parsons for Glenn Frey so why should I blame Hathaway for The Boys in the Band; the filmcraft and performances are first rate, if a bit stodgy; and isn't Lillian Hellman a reputable writer or something? Well I can only hope her reputation wasn't based on this. Yeah, all right - the moneyed bullies and brats who gang up to ruin the lesbian's life are shown to be despicable and wrong, and bound up in their petty superficialities. And it's 'their fault' Maclaine snuffs herself, so shame on them. But there's no sense that life was at all worth living anyway, without the straights' withheld sanction: she's an object to be batted around, with her suicide the only effective act of resistance anyone can think to articulate. And actually even worse is this totally f*cked ending, where coveted hetero pal Audrey Hepburn gets to walk out of the funeral, head held high, silent and strong, to face the brand new day alone and liberated. Well, bully for her! Unfortunately there's this dead LESBIAN over here...@#$%!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no doubt that the people making this film meant well, but the message it leaves behind is truly abominable. Shirley MacLaine and Audrey Hepburn lose their school because a horrid little girl and her nasty grandmother spread the word that they are lesbians. This accusation is treated as the most horrible, awful, disgraceful shame imaginable. It's as if they killed someone!! In a well-acted scene Shirley confesses to Audrey that the little girl may have picked up on some unspoken feelings she did have about possibly being a lesbian. But rather than showing hope for this confused character (who calls herself "dirty" for having feelings for another woman), this story has her immediately commit suicide. What a horrible destructive message!! I cannot imagine the hurt this must have caused young gay questioning women and men who may have seen this at the time. Society's prejudice and bigotry is clearly reinforced as suicide is presented as the only option. This is interesting as a museum piece into the bigotry and hatred for gay people that existed in that time. How unfortunate that in some quarters this sort of hatred still exists, and how sad that some people seem to see a worthy film in this misguided, hateful, homophobic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is good reason why this movie is based on an idiotic play (written by a woman - this I instinctively knew) and not on a real-life case. There is very little that is realistic about the story. The dumb plot-device of that medallion falling is used TWICE. The little trouble-maker girl is far too cunning and manipulative for her age; they gave her the personality of a grown-up (apart from the screaming and yelling). She is like Shirley Temple's evil twin: a caricature of a child, as opposed to being a real one. It is idiotic (not to mention so predictable) that MacLaine should commit suicide and this she does AFTER the news arrives that the whole thing turned out to be a lie and that a public apology was being arranged, etc. And on the same afternoon! Plus, where did she get a rope that quickly? If she had planned it before, surely the good news of the apology (etc.) would have diminished her suicidal tendencies, not killed her off, or? But no: she kills herself because she can't bare to be in Hepburn's presence after the former had finally revealed her lesbian secret. How very Shakespearean. (No: actually in a Shakespeare play EVERYONE is dead at the end.) I also consider Hepburn's insistence that Garner leave her very illogical; in the real world, a woman in Hepburn's situation would be ultra-grateful to have such a fiancé standing loyally beside her. But in this movie's twisted world Hepburn actually tortures him into admitting that he had a slight suspicion. And so what if he had?! It's only natural, given the circumstances! MacLaine's actress-relative returning to the school (i.e. house): now, there's another totally absurd event. There is also a very dumb scene in which a delivery man enters the house and looks at Hepburn and MacLaine as if he'd just witnessed a UFO landing: utterly exaggerated.MacLaine is very good, Garner is pretty solid, and the two of them easily upstage Hepburn, whom I never considered anything more than mediocre. She seems to serve a sort of decorative purpose in her movies, or better put: she is a sort of anorexic decoration, if one accept this oxymoron. MacLaine is far better-looking.If you're interested in reading my "biographies" of Shirley MacLaine, Audrey Hepburn and other Hollywood personalities, contact me by e-mail.</fullReview>
