		<shortDescription>Not Quite Garden State 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't necessarily expect to see the next step in Andrew Largeman's life. While the trailer makes you think "Hey, it's Zach Braff playing another guy who is confused about his life, and not sure where to go from here", The Last Kiss does offer a little more. For one its much more mature, and the characters are all flawed (and not in cute 'Natlalie Portman lies to get people to like her' ways) and they are all real. The performances were far better than i expected, the entire cast shines. The movie succeeds in appealing to everyone. No matter who you are and what state your romantic life is in, you will find someone to relate too. Jacinda Barrett finally gets to show some acting skills, and comes through beautifully. Casey Affleck is great. Zach Braff makes me understand why he wants something different, despite the fact that Jacinda Barrett seems so lovable. And the biggest surprise is Rachael Bilson. Early on she seems as if she is playing Summer Roberts on the big screen, but as her character unfolds she simmers with sex appeal, and was able to break my heart with just a simple gesture.The Last Kiss succeeds in letting its actors shine, and if anything you should see it for its great soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I saw the 2001 Italian original, but didn't remember much about it until I saw Tony Goldwyn's remake and the scenes and story came back. And it then surprised me how much of the original I managed to remember. That's also possibly because Oscar-winner Paul Haggis' screenplay sticks awfully close to its Italian origins.I am a fan of Zach Braff's work. "Scrubs," for my dough, is the best half-hour comedy on TV and his directorial debut, "Garden State," was one of the best films of 2004."The Last Kiss" is not a romantic comedy by any stretch of the imagination, no matter what advertising campaign the studio launched. This is a well-acted, well-told story about the dumb things we men do to the women we love. And, of course, the consequences.The film delves deeply into the insecurities of its characters, never offering pat answers or easy resolutions. There are no Richard-Gere-climbing-the-fire-escape-to-get-Julia Roberts moments in the film.Braff plays Michael, a 30s man facing the harsh reality that the rest of his life has been plotted out and he longs for something different. Despite having a gorgeous fiancée Jenna (the lovely Jacinda Barrett), he finds temptation around the corner.The film balances its three subplots well. They never interfere with the Michael-Jenna saga, yet add to the complexities of the story.However, I found it interesting that while in the Italian film, the object of the protagonist's desire was a high-school Lolita, Haggis and Co. opted to make her - in this case, Kim (Rachel Bilson) - a college student. The Italian film tends to be a bit more potent on that level, though Michael's attraction to Kim is believable.The performances all find the right pitch. Braff is completely believable as the confused young man in search of meaning to his life. Barrett is heartbreakingly good. There also are some terrific supporting performances from Casey Affleck, Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson. Then again, when was the last time you saw Wilkinson perform badly?Couples should see this film. It's a mature, thoughtful, unpretentious, and sometimes even difficult, movie to see. But it is gratifyingly good. Don't go expecting a typical fluffy date movie. This film raises interesting and important questions about couplehood and then lets you figure out the answers. When was the last time a Hollywood film did that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is that the Last kiss? Is that it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival to a packed house!And what a showing it was!When I stepped in to watch this, I had no idea where the movie would go, nor if it would be remotely interesting. But it quickly started to make sense. An outdoor wedding by the lake, guys talking guy stuff, and cute girls chatting and flirting from the other table, and soon you know it's going to be about guy/girl relationships. And so the plot evolves.And while it's not an entirely unique story-line, there are unique things about it. The characters are distinct. The main cast of 4 guys all get enough screen time and have their own 'problems' that can easily interweave that the story could really jump from one character to the next. That's a good thing. A relatively predictable story then becomes slightly less so.If you're looking for a moderate movie -- nothing too serious, but then nothing too fluffy -- something that you can watch, maybe chuckle a few times, or maybe something that might get you to think more deeply about relationship (and in particular if you're considering getting into a long-term relationship, or if you're not sure a long-term relationship you're in), then this would be just the ticket. You get into the minds of the characters, and there are quite a few that you can get to know, which lets you empathize with them. Some questions that I pondered watching this: is avoidance an option in life? Is truth always the best policy?Anyways, women will find this to be an enjoyable watch, as there are a few distinct women's points of view that come forth through this which seemed quite honest.Anyways. Strong acting. A few giddy moments, but fun overall. The result was a story that moved along nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found myself actually enjoying this movie very much. Without giving anything away, it deals with the story of four male friends and how their relationships with women have evolved. They are all in their late 20's about to hit 30 and the reality of behaving and acting like an adult suddenly sets in.I liked the movie very much because I saw myself in the main character and how I used to be when I was his age. Entertaining! The ending was actually surprising--the movie dealt with how both men and women react when they are hurt by the ones we love.Go see it! Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mature Look at Relationships.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Kiss, a film by Tony Goldwyn (Yes son of Samuel Goldwyn) was adapted from the 2001 Italian film L'Ultimo bacio, and written for the screen by none other than Paul Haggis. The Last Kiss goes through a number of relationships, spanning a number of different ages, and dissects the hardships of those relationships. Zach Braff seems to have upgraded his acting from Garden State and might actually become a more dexterous and talented actor than previously perceived. Paul Haggis' wonderful dialog lends greatly to the reality and adversity that co-exist alluringly within this screenplay. This film has been incorrectly advertised as a romantic comedy that puts Braff in the middle of two girls, and he cannot decide which one he wants to continue his life with. This is simply not true. The film is about a group of people that have just seen what the rest of their lives are going to be like, and want to add a small bump in the road of life. Overall the film does a lot more than your average romantic comedy/buddy film, and shoves the afflictions and austerities of modern-day relationships in your face. This is not the greatest of date movies, like the trailer wants us to believe, and should be perceived as a more earnest and pensive film than it appears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slightly problematic, yet excellent and poignant coming-of age film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I could never pin-point the one "off thing" about Garden State, I still am in believe that it is one of the best films I have seen in the past few years. Zach Braff really showed his worth with that film, and being an off-fan of Scrubs as well, I looked forward to his next film. It has been two years, but finally we now have The Last Kiss, which was scripted by recent two-time Oscar winner Paul Haggis. I managed to win a double pass to see a sneak preview of the film, and after seeing it, I am very glad that I did.The Last Kiss centres around Michael (Braff). He is twenty-nine, and like anyone growing up, is conflicted about life. He has a wonderful girlfriend, Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), who just happens to be expecting their child, and life-long friends (the likes of which include Casey Affleck and Eric Christian Olsen). But as he is beginning to go through this crisis, he ends up meeting a young College student named Kim (Rachel Bilson), who becomes totally drawn to Michael after she lays eyes on him during a wedding.What follows is a somewhat poignant coming-of age story. It is a bit of a departure from the usual work Haggis does, but his work here is just as good as the rest. On one hand, it is nowhere near as good as Garden State, but on the other, it feels more realistic and more mature than it. These are real characters facing real problems, and the fact is that, almost anyone can identify with them. The film stays grounded in reality for its entirety, and rarely deviates off course (unlike some of the strange subplots in State). While it does focus on Braff's character mainly, there is special attention brought down in many cases to Affleck's character (as Olsen's soul purpose seems to be most of the comedy and/or sex scenes). It is honest and for the most part, absolutely heart-breaking to watch the characters go through life's challenges. But at it's core, like State, it is a film that speaks to the current generation, and tries to make an attempt at letting them know that everyone feels these anxieties, and that they truly are not easy to deal with. I would be lying if I did not say that I saw a little bit of myself and my thoughts in these characters.The excellent performance here from Braff only continues to prove why he will soon become one of Hollywood's most sought-after actors. While some of the things his character ends up doing over the course of the film may become slightly agitating, his performance does not. Although his facial expression barely changes throughout the film, you can see the genuine emotion he is conveying in his performance. His body language and demeanor is both touching and pitiful (in a good way) at the same time. You really do not know if you want to love or hate this guy through his anxiety-ridden phase, and as a result, Braff really strikes an emotion-chord that probably would never have been even nearly as well developed with any other actor.Barrett and Bilson really stand out as the women in Braff's characters life. They play their characters so they distinctly different to the point of it being deliciously delightful all at once. The two contrast each other magnificently, from Barrett's wholesomeness to Bilson's devilish sexiness. The happiness and sadness they have to go through is excellent, and again, really gives a sense of realism to the film. They really grow throughout the film, and their chemistry with Braff is an absolute wonder to witness. Supporting turns from Affleck, as well as Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson as Jenna's parents are all very well done (although slightly underplayed), and only complement the other three even more so.The only thing I can really find wrong with the film lies squarely with Haggis' script (which was reportedly edited slightly by Braff). While the film is great, it really does not stay solid on what it is trying to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? It is hard to tell, as scenes that should be purely whimsical are not all that funny, and devastatingly dramatic scenes have the audience laughing hysterically. This only happened in a few instances (the rest of the scenes are either funny or dramatic), but it was downright awkward in many cases. Braff managed to blend the two together quite well for Garden State, and we have seen how masterful Haggis' work is, so why does it all not totally come together here? It really makes for quite the serious question, as the film could have easily slipped in as the best of the year so far, but must contend with being just one of the best.While the film has a chillingly bizarre problem with its tone, the performances and story more than make up for it. This is an excellent and poignant coming-of age film, and yet another vehicle to show off the work of Braff and Haggis. And with a superb supporting cast to boot, I am unsure of what more to ask for.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"And he knew, before he could kiss her, he must drive something out of himself. And a touch of hate for her crept back again into his heart." D. H. Lawrence, Sons and LoversI don't know about you, but maintaining love amid the pressures of modern society makes me feel every time as if this is the last kiss, even in a long term relationship. Will she tire of me or I of her? Will a baby change everything? Will marriage lock me in to my future without my control?These and other contemporary issues such as realistically understanding parents' adult-love situations are the purview of The Last Kiss, an intense melodrama that watches the disintegration and sometimes rehabilitation of every relationship in the film, including a parents' seemingly perfect union. As writer Paul Haggis did with Million Dollar Baby and Crash, he fashions reality-like dialogue around common struggles, which he elevates to universals. For example: "The world is moving so fast now that we start freaking long before our parents did because we don't ever stop to breathe anymore." This is not Eugene O'Neill, but it may be closer to modern idiom than the noted playwright's work.In other words, these situations sound more real than reality TV, even though both are scripted, possibly because this film does not attempt to glamorize or accessorize the everyday challenges of maintaining love. Ibsen crossed with Pinter is the closest I can come to the style and tone of The Last Kiss, as good an explication of modern romance as we're going to get this year.Granted, the people in this film are better looking than we and have more leisure time to agonize than we do, but then the beauty of art is in excising the mundane and exposing the big issues often played out by the beautiful. I fault the film only for its absolute adherence to reality, which does not admit elevated language while other elements are heightened such as the beautiful parents' home and the temptress's unworldly seductiveness.Be prepared to face yourself if you have a last kiss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Last Kiss' is one of the better movies dealing with adulthood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Kiss; Michael is a frustrated architect on the brink of turning 30, who's spirits are dampened when he begins feeling as if his life is formulatic and planned. At a good friend's wedding, he meets Kim, a beautiful and charming college student. Michael's uncertanties with his fiancée Jenna lead to an unexpected affair with his new collegiate. However Michael is forced to deal with the consequences of his actions when his secret spills.The Last Kiss is a very good movie, although you're likely to be depressed leaving the theater if you are under the age of 30. Smart, engaging and honest, along with incredible acting and dead-on dialogue add up to a penetrating, insightful melodrama that isn't afraid to pull the punches.The movie is undeniably sad, but it's a certain type of sad in which you will probably find it hard to look away. The characters are interesting, flawed people just like you and me, and everyone stumbles onto something interesting from scene to scene.4 from 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the movies I have seen recently, trying to grasp a hint of real life experience, this delivers in a splendid and quite significant way. Not to mention the terrific acting, but the comparison of several different relationships really works. Zach Braff is awesome as usual, as well as Casey Affleck's unusual appeal as the "the very unhappy married man" but the real surprises for me were that of Jacinda Barrett and Rachel Bilson. Jacinda Barrett, aka Real World London hottie, who knew she had this in her? Her and Braff's fight scenes literally brought tears to my eyes because they were so true to life, the acting from her was phenomenal. And Rachel Bilson? Goodbye O.C., hello mistress of seduction. She really broke away from her only known role as Summer Roberts, and introduced the world to a more mature actress, willing to take risks that actually work!!! The ending is definitely left up to interpretation, which changes the age old myth, that all problems can be resolved in two hours time!! I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, My lucky streak is over...I finally rented a bad movie. Maybe it was because I was lazy, maybe its because my regular video store guy was there...who knows...The point is, The Last Kiss wasn't worth the effort. The acting was so-so, especially the performance from Rachel Bilson, who I secretly find really unattractive. Her and the lead Zach Braff have absolutely no chemistry, and the love scene between them is an awful, painful experience.I still enjoy Zach, though, and I'll forgive him for one bad movie.Highlights are really limited to Tom Wilkinson and Casey Affleck in supporting roles. Not big, but they make the movie a little more bearable.All in all, I wouldn't suggest this movie. I'd give it an Only if you had to, unless you're a huge Zach Braff fan. In which case, watch it to say you saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant look at real relationships and heart ache and coming of age that isn't teen age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in awhile a film appears and really surprises you with how intelligent and real it is and the powerful message it conveys. It's usually these films that you just find something that connects you to it and makes an impression on you and The Last Kiss certainly did that for me. The Last Kiss could perhaps be described as a dark comedy but I truly think it's comedic value simply comes from being a very true to life film...art imitating life as it were. The cast are all very strong and the story is riveting and important and has such a strong moral lesson behind it that everyone and anyone can get something from it. Most importantly it is in a very small selection of films that deals quite poignantly with the coming-of-age of a different sort. Most people consider coming-of-age somewhere in your teens...almost twenties but for a lot of twenty-somethings we know that becoming an adult sometimes takes a little longer and that is exactly what this film deals with.Zach Braff definitely demonstrates some serious acting chops with this film and pulls far away from his comedic roots although this isn't the first time. Braff is truly great as the anxious, overwhelmed late twenties guy Michael, who suddenly finds himself on the brink of leaving youth behind. He has marriage in front of him, friends that are on to different paths in their lives, and everything appears 'planned out.' Braff shows a confused, rather immature man who finds out he wants to grow up almost to late. He's a relate-able character to anyone watching the film. Jacinda Barrett plays Michael's long time girlfriend Jenna that everyone loves including Michael but he sees her as his final step into leaving youth behind. They share a wonderful relationship but Michael is scared. Braff and Barrett are perfect together and have terrific chemistry. Barrett is perfect as the hurt and devastated girlfriend in everything. Rachel Bilson plays the young, carefree, hot college student Kim that turns Michael upside down when she shows an interest in having a fling with him. Bilson is terrific in this role and probably had a difficult time with it considering she isn't exactly the character to like in the film. Nonetheless some may relate to her and see her for what she is. Her chemistry with Braff is also outstanding and comes across as more of an obsession than real which is perfect for the role. Michael's friends, each in their own stage of life, are played by Casey Affleck, Michael Weston and Eric Christian Olsen. The three of them do a great job in their small roles and each represent a different path in life that the four of them are looking onto.Legendary TV and screen writer Paul Haggis knows how to capture emotion and realism which is exactly what makes his stories so amazing and he puts exactly that into this film. On top of that the actors are perfectly cast, the story moves at the perfect pace and it's just all around a great film. The film is almost hard to watch because Braff's character makes so many errors that almost make you cringe but it's real life and everything unfolds like that. I think I might have enjoyed the film more had their been less of a happy or good ending because then it would have demonstrated consequences of Braff's actions but nonetheless the film is terrific. Definitely not much of a romance or a date film but a great movie to watch with anyone. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a filthy movie!! It definitely should not have been rated R -- NC-17 would have been more appropriate. I had to turn it off after only about 1/2 an hour because of the graphic (straight and gay) sex scenes! Seems like the intimacy could have been alluded to without being so graphic. It may have been a good story, but I'll never know because I was so disgusted by the sex. Very disappointing. I wish I could get my money back from Blockbuster! I love a good romance, and a good thought-provoking story, but really...if I'd wanted p0rn, I would have rented p0rn. I;m not against sex--please understand me--but I AM against having to see it so graphically portrayed in a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello but everyone on this website is talking as though this is the original film IT ISN'T (although most of the trailers fail to mention that) its basically a very average translation of a great Italian film called 'L'ultimo bacio' by Gabriele Muccino from 2001. In the original film Carlo is in a relationship with Giulia and they are going to have a baby together (sound familiar) over the top of the film there is Carlo's dialogue about growing up and reaching 30 how when he was young he dreamt of being grown up and how now he is there he realises he preferred being young bla bla bla. Anyway he's at a wedding where he meets, the young, but beautiful, Francesca and he is infatuated with her etcetcetc. To cut a long story short has an affair realises what he's done and goes grovelling back to his pregnant girlfriend who obviously takes him back. At the same time his friends love stories are unfolding and a group decide to go on a roadtrip to Africa, etc. Also Giulia's parents split up but get back together. The point I'm trying to make is that it is exactly the same movie but it unfortunately never reached anyone in the English speaking world. I'm not saying the remake is bad its not, its good. I just think its a shame that none of you probably know there is an original let alone seen it. The original is one of my favourite films and however many times they remake they can never beat it. It was a good try though! I hasten to add that this new version has no sign of being released here in Italy, I have never heard any mention of it. Swings and roundabouts as they say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trite, undeveloped, stunted, abysmal....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost need to develop a new vocabulary for how terrible this movie is.The characters are undeveloped, uninteresting, unmotivated, unbelievable, and unsympathetic. Every role is compromised in the writing to be shallow and flawed, though no reasons other than "life is hard" are given for the flaws.Does this make the movie "honest"? Hardly. It makes it a montage of clichés and stereotypes, with stilted dialog and horrible acting to go with it. Why do these characters even care about each other, much less me caring about them? That's just for starters. Even within any given scene, there are dialog and emotional inconsistencies. An actual line from what I think was supposed to be a dramatic break-up scene involves a woman opening a door and screaming "GET OUT!" to her husband. Seconds later, she says, "Go on, go if you want to!" What? Do you want him to get out, or go if he wants to? Again, I am sure plenty of folks (I am very negatively astounded that this movie impresses roughly 2/3rds of viewers) will consider that part "suitably confusing" and "true to the emotional nature of the scene". No. Well-written scenes remain consistent while still being packed with drama and real emotion. This was packed with TV-movie quality triteness, written by someone who apparently feels the need to preach at our faces and hit us over the head with how hard life is. Seriously, I have bruises.Underlying ALL of this aggravating cinema is a distinct feel of victim mentality. EVERY character is playing the victim in this film. Poor me, deciding about marriage is hard. Poor me, holding a marriage together (or not) is hard. Poor me, life is full of temptations. Poor me, I thought I had it all together and now I am using platitudes to try to describe it to the world. Oh dear, it really could not have been a worse movie if it had tried. Maybe it WAS trying to specifically represent the worst way in the world to spend 100 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Anti-Date Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that takes the characters where they don't usually go. It's not a romantic movie and if the hero makes a mistake it's not a sweet one, not one that the audience would adore. Still, "The Last Kiss" gives you more opportunities to identify with the main characters than most romcoms. We get a look at the phase after the romantic beginning. After the butterflies in your stomach have gone and it's actually hard work to keep your relationship alive.The way love is portrayed as something bleak here in five different story lines seems a bit forced at times and some characters are downright annoying. It probably would have been better to just concentrate on Zach Braff's story (and to avoid having Casey Affleck in the cast).The other mistake that "The Last Kiss" makes is that it's smart alec in certain parts of the dialog, spelling out things for you that you really could have thought of for yourself. For instance, one character is giving a speech at one point about how life is always getting faster, so people sleep into crisis at younger ages, blah blah blah. Yes, that's not really a revelation. The movie is much more interesting, when we just see the main character slipping deeper and deeper into trouble and being unable to resist his temptation. The target audience, if you want, for this movie are the twenty somethings going thirties. That point in your life when you realize you're really not that young anymore and you can't decide between growing up and enjoying the last days of your youth. Everyone in that age will find that "The Last Kiss" really speaks to him or her.Speaking of him or her: this is definitely not a movie you would want to watch with your partner as it's probably going to lead to some heated discussions. Women will probably very much identify with the female characters, while men will feel the pain of Braff and his friends.Unfortunately, I haven't seen "L'ultimo baccio", yet, so I cannot compare "The Last Kiss" to the original. Judging it by its own merit, however, I found the remake to be an overall thought-provoking and original movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't really too interested in seeing The Last Kiss, but I heard so many good things about it, especially from my best friend, so I decided to give the movie a shot. Even though it still felt like an American version of Love Actually, because it gave us a view of what different relationships are like with a little twist of how men, no matter how good their intentions are to stay with the same woman, there is always a falter. The Last Kiss is proof that there is always a grey area in relationships no matter how strong they may seem.We have 5 men, one is in a relationship with a woman who is carrying his child, but he meets another young college girl at wedding and discusses his fear of the relationship. One can't get enough loving and refuses to to commit. One is in a marriage with a new born baby and is feeling the hard core pressure from his wife to become a good father. One can't get over his ex and refuses to give up on her, but finally decides to do some traveling to see what's out there. And finally we have our long term married man who has taken his wife for granted.The Last Kiss turned out to be over all a good surprise and I think most adults could relate to in one way or another. Although the ending left us with some confusion, I think we could all interpret what happened, so it's all good. But I would recommend The Last Kiss for all movie lovers or even if you are just looking for a good movie, because let's face it, we do sometimes need a mirror to see what's going on in our lives.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Last Kiss is a movie about people, relationships and the human nature. It shows,in a very truth full way,some of our fears and anxieties when it comes to be with someone.The story revolves around 4 friends; Izzy, who is not dealing well with a recent break-up and is getting a hard time to let go,Kenny who goes trough life (and women) without committing,Chris a co-worker of Michael that can't handle the pressure of being a good father and the stress his wife creates and Michael who is married to Jenna in what looks like a perfect marriage.The sudden notice of Jenna's pregnancy makes Michael re-think his life and his goals and he starts to feel trapped.Then he meets a college girl and the 2 of them embark in a relationship without thinking trough.I think most of us can relate to what Zach Braff's character is going trough in the earlier beginning of the movie, sooner or later we all question our lives; where it is now and where its going.Not a masterpiece, but so much more then a chick flick. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Much Realism...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, I watched the Last Kiss on HBO and for me Jacinda Barret took a so-so film and made it into something special. It brought back memories that were 25 years old. I lived with the same girl (Barbara) for several years, but refused to married her and I certainly did not want kids. Barbara at the time was a beautiful girl and in many ways uncanny resemblance to Jacinda, with not only her looks, but her mannerisms and even her demeanor. Anyway?she caught me fooling around on her. She dumped me. At first, I could care less because it gave me a chance to play the field. The problem was when I was with another girl I couldn't help but think Barbara and wished I was really with her instead. I realized than that I made a horrible mistake and I begged her to take me back but to no avail. She wanted nothing more to do with an uncommitted loser like me!The Last Kiss, for me went back into time. The scene Jenna went to the house to consul a grieving friend where Chris couldn't lie to Jenna was incredible. The realism in that short scene was some of the best acting I had ever seen. Jenna is so sweet and somber and than going innocently into the kitchen to get some info from Chris on Michael's whereabouts. The way the camera runs after her. The way she turns to her cell phone to find answers. The dramatic change in Jenna's facial features, especially in her eyes, tells the whole story. The dialog is excellent and she pulls it off. When Jenna says "who is he with right now"? It is so real, so believable that you could literally see all that pain crashing down on her. The following scenes with Michael are equally spectacular. Jacinda shines throughout the movie and turns a 2 star film into a four star.Back to Barbara and me?I had totally given up on her coming back to me. I was getting ready to move out of state and called one of her friends and ask if one of my friends could come by Barbara's and pickup a couple family keepsakes of mine so he could mail them to me after I get settled in. The day I before I was leaving I was so depress because I was sure I would never see Barbara again. I remember getting on my knees, resting my head and hands on a couch and began to weeping like a baby (new to me because I hadn't cried once since I was 10). I than began to pray (this was also new to me since I was a professing atheist). I simply said "Jesus save me".That night Barbara called me?We have four wonderful sons that any father would be so proud of. I still love her so much! I also believe in miracles and forgiveness. I cannot say enough about Jacinda's outstanding performance. EdCopyright © 2003-2008. All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Haggis (Crash &amp; other major films) wrote the screenplay, taken from an obscure Italian movie (Which had to be funnier &amp; better).Tony Goldwyn (grandson of the legendary SAMUEL GOLDWYN) directed this idiocy (I can see Sam pointing NO-NO at grandchild )The women in this movie are all spoiled,think only of themselves &amp; basically hate men. The men all except one minor character seem to accept this as there fate in life.This could have been better if both the writer &amp; director loosened up &amp; realized this was a silly comedy NOT real life,This needed a satiric biting farce edge. As made, neither the serious points or the comic comic ones came across.Zack Graff is the lead,he needs better roles, Jacionda Barrett plays opposite him,she knows how to cry &amp; yell &amp; thats about it. NO CHEMISTRY whatsoever. Tom Wilkinson &amp; Blythe Danner are her parents &amp; as usual they are good. Also appearing is Casey Affleck (Ben's brother). He seems to improve in every film. Harold Ramis has a small role as well.I did not recognize him)Nie sets &amp; production values, Now if they only had a a funny script &amp; more accomplished leads, this may have been good, But it is not.Ratings ** (out of 4) 63 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a really bad copy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie that was supposed to be the English version of an other very fine movie, l'Ultimo Bacio, whose only sin was to be in Italian, Mr. Tony Goldwyn's motion picture is rather poor. Poor in style, in acting, and, amazingly, considering that is a copy, poor in writing. Zach Braff is OK, he is one of those actors that plays almost always the same character, yet his acting is sufficiently decent one could dare to say, although, if compared with the original character played by the gifted Stefano Accorsi then Mr. Braff loses the contest. Same story for Jacinda Barrett vs. Giovanna Mezzogiorno. Let alone the comparison between the young Rachel Bilson (who is beautiful!) and Martina Stella in the original. The movie's script is rather too bourgeois, notwithstanding the story, there is very little tension, even Ms Barrett's father and mother are very understanding of Mr. Braff's mistakes. What fine polite and condescend reality has Ms. Haggis been living in? Sure, we should never compare originals with remakes, but in this case I think is important because MR. Godwin's movie betrays the feeling and philosophy behind the original Muccino's Ultimo bacio, the romantic and dramatic loss farewell to youth, by giving us a shallow summary of the same concept. The last kiss is altogether a pale old Polaroid of L'ultimo bacio. If you have the chance, watch the original and forget this remake. When Hollywood will learn that originality is priceless?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"People Know The Truth. They Might Not Like It Or Want To Know It, But They Always Know. Lie And You'll Lose Her." --- Stephen (Tom Wilkinson)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last Kiss" (2006) Directed By: Tony Goldwyn Starring: Zach Braff, Jacinda Barrett, Casey Affleck, Rachel Bilson, Michael Weston, Eric Christian Olsen, Blythe Danner, Tom Wilkinson, &amp; Marley Shelton MPAA Rating: "R" (for sexuality, nudity and language) I didn't expect anything from "The Last Kiss". I didn't necessarily expect it to enjoy it, but I didn't necessarily expect to not enjoy it either. I was quite indifferent to this movie actually. So, imagine my surprise when I discovered that "The Last Kiss" is one of the most touching, poignant, and romantic films of 2006, achieving a complex understanding of human relationships and anxieties. It has great performances that are vulnerable and realistic. They give the movie a very authentic feel and, fortunately, all of the actors underplay it. They could have easily gone over-the-top with the emotional scenes and yet they do not. They allow sheer emotion to shine through, rather than masking it with tears, sobbing, and screaming. The only scene that does not follow this effect is handled in a different, yet effective way. I will not give it a way, but you will most certainly know which scene I speak of when you watch the movie. And you should watch this movie. It is a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted character study that is emotionally resonant and genuine.Michael (Braff) is a young man who is in love with Jenna (Barrett). The two are engaged and are expecting their first child?but Michael has many anxieties about settling down. He feels as though his old life will end when he is married?and what if he isn't ready to close the book on that part of his life? He happens upon a beautiful young college student named Kim (Bilson) and the two begin an innocent relationship. They are just friends?but Michael refuses to tell Jenna, wanting to keep the relationship a secret. At the same time, Jenna's parents are going through a spot of trouble. Her mother, Anna (Danner), is sick of feeling unloved and leaves Jenna's father, Stephen (Wilkinson). Michael's friends, all in various stages of relationships, also begin to have many problems with their loved ones. "The Last Kiss" tells of the drama that can exist between any couple in any stage of their relationship and that, ultimately, love is a leap of faith that must be made between two people together?or not at all.Zach Braff leads the cast admirably, making us feel for him even though he does a few unlikable things. Braff gives a layered and complex performance. Jacinda Barrett gives a sympathetic show. We could invest most of our emotions with her, because she was a relatable character. Barrett's controlled performance worked well here. Casey Affleck also does a good job. Not too long ago, I expressed my surprise that Mischa Barton did "The OH in Ohio" as a follow-up to her role in "The O.C." rather than a role in some teen comedy or slasher flick. I applauded her for doing so?and I do the same for Rachel Bilson. Bilson obviously wanted to prove her talent here, rather than just to stay in the limelight. She took a character that could have been an unlikable one and made it into something more. It worked very well.When "The Last Kiss" ended, I realized that I had watched an interesting study on characters and relationships that was very touching and realistic in its portrayal of love and humanity. It tells several beautiful stories, all connected, with great performances and excellent writing. It is a surprisingly effective and in-your-face drama that will make you take a deeper look inside of yourself as a result of your watching it. Some critics deemed the movie to be boring and fake, but I must say that they really missed the point. "The Last Kiss" does take a few liberties by having all of the various relationship problems presented in one group of people, but each problem is something that some couples face. This leads me to the movie's major flaw: some of the characters probably could have been deleted altogether. They and their rather unimportant problems, at times, overshadowed the two main story lines and I just didn't really see a point. But, really, what "The Last Kiss" has to offer is too important to turn down.Final Thought: "The Last Kiss" is a touching, romantic, but truthful portrayal of relationships.Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't see this with your boyfriend!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I very much enjoyed this film - I am so glad I didn't have my boyfriend with me when I watched it. This drama is entirely focused on the infidelity of human nature in relationships. Every character was at some stage of a relationship in the film. The film pretty much captured every stage from infatuation and puppy love(Rachel Bilson), the agonizing break-up and wanting someone back (guy at wedding, can't remember his name), a 30+ year marriage saturated with problems (Danner), a young marriage with a baby ridden with problems all resulting from that phase of their relationship and too frustrated to cope (Casey Affleck), the incessant sex and physical relationship b/t the long haired guy (again, don't remember his name) and girl who had met at the wedding that quickly ended when she wanted to introduce him to her parents, and of course the central couple (Zach Braff) about to have a baby. Almost every phase of a relationship was portrayed in this film - but not in a good way. The only person portrayed as legitimately in love, was Jacinda. And of course she was the one wronged. In retrospect, I'm not sure exactly what I liked about the movie other than it was definitely entertaining, and I'm a pretty tough critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, OK, but it's a remake!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I browsed through twenty-something user comments just to be sure, but not one of them seems to mention, that this film is actually a remake of the 2001 Italian film L'ultimo bacio. And although I can't say, that the American version is bad, but it is somewhat disappointing after seeing the original, which is far superior in every aspects.First of all, I don't deny, that Paul Haggis is an excellent script-writer, but he shouldn't be given credit for this one, for the plot line is pretty much the same (there are some differences, but they're, I think, for the worse - for example the college girl character is actually an 18-years-old high school student in the Italian version, and has somewhat different characteristics).Also, the acting of the Hollywood version ranges from OK to quite good, but the Italian cast simply blew me away - incredible performances all over.All in all, I don't want to diminish this film, I won't give it a bad rating, but I just can't think of an argument why this version should be preferred over the original, so if you have a choice, do yourself a favor and see L'ultimo bacio instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Kiss follows, tangentially, the stories of four buddies approaching thirty, and attempts to address the issues raised when they are forced to confront the gulf between their youthful dreams for their futures and the reality that they will really have to live in. Braff's Michael is the main story, and when we meet him he is panicking because his life feels very much planned out ? his longtime girlfriend is pregnant, he's about to turn thirty ? and he wonders what life will be like now that there are no surprises left. As Jenna (Jacinda Barrett) tries to draw him closer, we see him balk in subtle ways, until temptation reveals itself to him in the form of a college girl named Kim (Rachel Bilson, looking remarkably like a younger Katie Holmes). Kim is everything Jenna is not, and Michael finds himself attracted to this younger woman. The other stories interweave with his; another friend is only into one night stands and thinks he's found the perfect partner until she springs her parents on him at a surprise dinner. A second friend just can't get over his ex-girlfriend, and the last one is in a marriage that's falling apart, partially over their baby. So Michael at least has a lot of options to consider when he's mulling over his own situation.Last Kiss moves very slowly in spots, sometimes so slowly you find yourself reaching for the remote. While it purports to be an examination of relationships, the lesson that it teaches is that they are all hard work and compromise and little joy ? in fact, the only time anyone in the movie is having any fun at all is when they are fooling around on someone, an odd message in a relationship film. It can sometimes be difficult to understand why Michael wants to be with Jenna when every other relationship in the movie is portrayed as a confining trap.It doesn't help that Braff and Bennett have no chemistry ? in fact, Jenna is so thoroughly unlikable that it's hard to see what Michael sees in her other than stability, which, I can tell you from experience, is not that attractive to most 30-year old men. Another problem is that Braff has no chemistry with Bilson, either, so they never click as a couple. You don't really understand why he's with one girl over another, or why he'd choose to cheat with Kim, other than the fact that she's young and pretty and practically throws herself at him. Kim is meant to represent the promise of fading youth to Michael, another path which is merely fun and parties and fooling around, but the two are such a mismatch ? Michael seems forty when he's around Kim, not thirty ? that it's almost painful to watch, and the shallowness of that relationship is laid bare in five minutes. You can tell quite clearly that whatever Michael wants Kim can't give it to him, and you can see he's self-aware enough to realize that, and yet, there he is, fooling around with her.I wouldn't say the movie doesn't make sense, but the plot and characters bent to serve the message, which is, relationships are hard work, not fun, but compromising who you are is better than being alone. Since I fundamentally disagree with such a pessimistic view of love and relationships (and feel, frankly, that it is better to be alone than with the wrong person), I had a lot of trouble with this film, and the weakly sketched characters and situations didn't help. The performances were uneven as well ? Bilson injects Kim with a youthful vitality, but she's so shallow (her idea of a romantic gift is a mix-CD) it's hard to really like her. And Braff is all over here, never finding the character's center, always allowing himself to float along with the current. Only at the end, when Michael makes a firm decision about his life, is his character or the movie any good; but a strong five minutes at the end of a lackluster story can't save the movie. The Last Kiss is one you could easily do without, in this case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful look at relationship challenges and choices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I completely enjoyed this movie and so did my children, who only wanted to see it because Zach Braff was in it. I think this is an incredible insight into the challenges of young people to make the right choices, and also how most people (young and old) don't delve too deeply when they make choices that will affect their whole life. It also demonstrated that a lot of young people, superficial happiness is what they seem to be drawn to, in the name of love. To see Zach deal with his doubts and failing the test is quite insightful. I'm sure there are millions of young men and women who can identify with the characters. I feel the story is sensitive, and at the same time does not offer easy solutions for the issues that the characters deal with. I think the best line is from Blythe Danner (who I absolutely LOVE in anything she does) when she firmly tells her daughter "You have no clue what goes into a 30 year marriage!" She is wonderfully lost in what she wants out of her life at this stage in her life and it is balanced by Tom Wilkinson's quiet patience and wisdom, as he waits to catch his suffering wife. He plays a therapist, and I think they did a wonderful job of him not being the emotional voice of the movie, trying to teach people how to deal with relationships. One side effect is that Jacinda Barrett is from Australia with a distinct accent, and Tom Wilkinson is from the UK with a very distinct accent. It is wonderful to see so many actors from across the water who can actually pull off sounding very American.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best (anti-)date movie of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say right away that this is not a typical happy-ending movie about mending love. Those kind of movies are heavy cliché's by now.This movie is actually based on another Italian movie L' Ultimo Bacio, which was more surrounded around the issue of pregnancy before marriage, The Last Kiss kind of continues after that.I was attracted to this movie by Zach Braff (huge fan since Scrubs) and expected something along the lines of Garden State (which was also really good). Instead, I was hit with a huge dose of reality that could easily translate to many as depression.It doesn't just focus on one couple, rather, several others, from different generations as well. It's balanced in a way where you think all is well for one, another couple gets just as bad, or worse; and not for the same reasons either.The acting is well done, on all parts, and the emotion is presented at its highest sincerity.Couples should be forewarned before seeing this movie, as it could bring up a lot of personal questions, that's because this movie is that good, hitting all the notes on a real-life relationship crisis.I give this movie a perfect ten for presenting relationships without deluding them with cliché (artificial) happiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I strongly urge you all to watch Gabriele Muccino's original "L'ultimo baccio" of which this film is a remake, which is largely better. I thought Zachary Braff was a miscast (his Italian alter-ego is better). Rachel Bilson, however, is lovely and very much like the rookie blond girl in the original movie (her first appearance on screen). Jacinta Barret is great. still, the Italian original movie has more strength, warmth and is an overall better movie. And then, the emotional reactions, feelings and overall personalities of all characters in the film are 100 percent Italian (and Latin, for that matter), and parts of the script seem "forced" with the burden put on Americans</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Believable, Didn't Work For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting idea but not well executed. From the beginning, Zach's character is morose about his fortunate situation in life with a good job and a lovely pregnant girlfriend, as he's pushing 30. That in itself is not a problem. The plot revolves around his affair with a college Junior who seems to throw herself at him for no good reason. He may have had an attractive personality a month before the movie takes place, but when he meets Junior at the wedding, the director has him playing a very uninteresting person, not someone whom a beautiful, non-neurotic Junior would throw herself at.This could have worked if the director had him play a cooler guy who is still conflicted about the predictability of his life, like one of his friends, and if his pregnant girlfriend had a few real flaws. For all I know, the European movie that this is based on had those more realistic portrayals, as European movies are likely to do. Then the cheating might have been believable.Overall, the acting was pretty good which made it watchable, and I look forward to more movies with Casey, Jacinda and Rachel. However, you may not find it worth the time. I didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly decent acting, terrible premise for movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say first off, that I really enjoyed Garden State, and that I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Lo and behold, I found it at Walmart for $5 last week, so I snagged it up.Now I know why it was only $5.I think my biggest problem with this movie was that there was very little room for sympathizing with the main characters. Zach Braff's character, Michael, gets "scared" of the future, and allows himself to be tempted by a college-age twit played by Rachel Bilson. Bilson's character (Kim) is annoyingly forward from the first, and pursues Michael even when she knows he has a girlfriend. Michael's character is disgustingly weak - and those of you that cheered this movie for it's "honesty" should try to dig up your morals or self-worth if this is how you behave.The only character that was worth anything was Chris, played by Casey Affleck. I had previously written Affleck off as a goof, but he plays this part well, and his character actually has a story that normal (AKA not sleeping with every person that comes into your path) people can sympathize with.If you enjoy feeling agitated during a movie, mostly due to the stupidity of the characters, then by all means, waste your time and money on this movie. If not, just watch Garden State again and pretend Zach Braff never made this mistake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie takes you on a bumpy ride and leaves you in the middle of nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All i can say about this film is that it was a waste of my money. The story was so pointless and empty; just the way the plot unfolded was bland and it didn't take you anywhere. The story itself had somewhat potential, but the way the script was written and how everything played out with the characters in the movie barely scratched the surface. It didn't go deep enough into the relationship between the characters and the characters themselves. There was no connection from scene to scene and none of the characters went through a realistic "arch" and there was practically no real climax. It was as if the directer just put puzzle pieces together with his head in the water, giving us only a glimps of an actual story. I wouldn't even recommend this movie because it isn't even entertaining. The whole movie was just bland and shallow. It just takes you along this bumpy ride and leaves you in the middle of NOWHERE. The only reason I WOULD recommend watching this movie is because of Rachel Bilson. She looks HOT in this movie. I hope this comment helped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Last Kiss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you're in your twenties, you feel invincible. Fresh out of school, and with a world of opportunities ahead of you, the general feeling is that nothing can go wrong. At least that's how I felt. And so far, nothing drastic has knocked me off my feet, or grounded my perceived progress to a halt.That is, until you hit the big three-oh, and start wondering about a whole host of issues, like what you're going to do with your life, are you going to settle down with that someone special if he/she exists, and essentially, what the heck happened in the last 10 years which seem to just whizz by, as if the decade just passed by without any significant milestones. And the male characters in The Last Kiss, are about the same age as I am, and in this story, they take a long hard look and evaluate heir circumstances, albeit all from a relationship point of view.Adapted from a Spanish movie L'ultimo Bacio with a screenplay by Paul Haggis (who also wrote the screenplays for Casino Royale and Flags of Our Fathers now out in theatres), The Last Kiss stars Zach Braff as Michael, our guy who's stuck at the crossroads of his life. Everything's fine and dandy, great job, hybrid car, and living in with his pregnant girlfriend Jenna (Jacinda Barrett). However, that contemplation of life, of what's next, and his disbelief about marriage, has forced him to seriously think about the future. He's unsure, and in his vulnerable state, gets very tempted by a younger, beautiful girl, Kim (Rachel Bilson) when she throws herself at him.Yes, Rachel Bilson from TV's OC has followed in the footsteps of fellow OC hot babe Mischa Barton, playing yet another sweet nubile temptation in their big screen debut (Barton did her tour in The Oh in Ohio). As the seductress, her character totally loses herself in the company of Michael, and feminists in the audience would roll their eyes and find it hard pressed to find a valid reason to fall for that cad Michael, who is definitely tempted and should have stuck to his guns.Although the spotlight is definitely centered on this story arc, there are a few others which focus on Michael's friends, all hitting their 30s, and each facing dilemmas in their own right. Chris (Casey Affleck) is not getting along with his wife, who's high strung from taking care of their kid, Izzy (Michael Weston) cannot get over his ex girlfriend, and is actually an obsessive wuss, upset at her ability to move on so easily, and Eric Christian Olsen as Kenny the hipster player who's totally non-committal. Interactions between the guys are limited though, and each potential short story arc brings forth potential unexplored in full.But perhaps we have to leave it to the older folk to shed some light in this movie. Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson somehow light up the screen with their chemistry, as two elderly married couple who are at odds with each other, because of the lack of some tender loving affection showered upon the other. Harold Ramis makes a surprise appearance, and he's almost ballooned to twice the size since his lean Ghostbusters days.I'd actually thought I could easily identify with the broad issues faced by the host of characters here, but given it's focus just on relationships, it was a little below expectations. Nonetheless, it's one movie whose themes do set you thinking, especially about the touchy issue on fidelity (hence, who's the recipient of your very last kiss?), and even then it doesn't end by making any bold statements, but it chose to sit on the fence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do yourself a favor, see the original (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>L'ultimo bacio (the original film by Gabriele Muccino) happens to be one of my favourite Italian films, if only the last 6 years are counted. Its not a timeless masterpiece, but it's a very ironic, realistic, and entertaining look at the age through which I am presently going. I was already cheesed that a perfectly good movie has to be remade just because the original is not in English. But if you have to remake it,for god's sake, don't change a sarcastic, ANTIromantic film, with an ending cynical to the core, to a romantic comedy with a Hollywood ending.SPOILERS START HERE. For those of you who did not see the Italian film a) Kim was a naive 18 year old, certainly not a slutty 20somethingcollege student. b) When asked if "it was only a kiss", Michael looks sweetly in theeye of his would-be wife and says "yes, I swear". c) Then they happily get married. Right before the credits, however,a flash-forward leaves little doubt that the marriage will not beso different from that of the parents d) In this film, one can not understand at all why Chris left AriannaIn the original version, while he is still somewhat of a loser,its also hard not to feel some sympathy for him.And he leaves. At the end, during Michaels and Jennas wedding,they are shown to go into the sunset. e) The ONLY character who is reasonably similar, in personality and howhe relates to the other characters, to the original, is StephenI could go on. These are not details. They take the meaning of the film and turn it on its head. It would be fine if it was a different film, which was going to have a different message. But this is a "remake". Please, don't subsidize present Hollywood's lack of talent, and try to find the original film. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disgrace to our generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is made up of mere facades and tricks that attempt to emulate other quality films that deal with complex emotions and "coming of age" situations. In doing so, the film and its cast (headed by Zach "hack" Braff) paint the new generation of filmmakers/actors as a group lacking in knowledge of both human emotions and (more blatantly) a solid understanding of storytelling.For a good example of all that this film was trying to do, watch "Friends With Money". While it's nothing to put on your top ten list, "Friends" takes an ensemble cast of familiar yet unpredictable characters facing major decisions or turning points in their lives. Yet, unlike "Last Kiss", the film is filled with good dialogue and colorful characters who give us some insight into who they are, who they want to be, and what they had been doing for the 30+ years before the story begins. "Last Kiss" gives us none of this. NADA. The first hint of "Last Kiss's" staggering shallowness is in Braff's voice over (the only one we hear throughout the film) which tries to sum up all of the personal insight that the rest of the film won't show you.I refer to this film as a "disgrace" to our generation not only because of the film's vapid/sloppy/lazy/one-dimensional/gimmicky portrayal of serious issues; but also in response to all of the praise it has received on the IMDb comments. ARE YOU ALL BEING PAID!?!?!? Seriously, what gives? If I am alone, and the rest of America's twentysomethings think that this film is "touching" and "engaging" then maybe we deserve to be fed this crap.But I know I am not alone. In fact 4 of my friends walked away from the TV screen last night mid-film. Why did I watch it? I needed the ammo for this review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They cut out the only redeeming part of the movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to have lived in Italy at the time L'Ultimo Baccio -- the film this one is based on -- was released. And that's a great movie.This one follows, more or less, the same plot as the other. But they skip the final scene that literally changes everything. Without this scene, it's a pathetic and generic movie not worth checking out. With it, not only would the movie have been moderately good -- it also would have lived up to it's title! I cannot even begin to convey how disappointed I was in this movie.My advice? Skip this one and check out the original L'Ultimo Baccio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst. Movie. Ever. Don't waste your money or your time. It's every other movie you've ever seen about divorce, only this one stars Zach Braff and isn't remotely funny.The only reason I rented it was because of Garden State. I thought if Zach Braff can write/direct/star such a clever and amazing movie that any subsequent movie he was in would be golden. I was so wrong.The Last Kiss is a "slice of life" movie that tracks a few friends going thru rough patched in their relationships. It was clever or funny. It didn't make thoughtful comments about relationships or marriage. It was simply two hours of the most boring crap I've ever seen. I wanted to turn it off after the first 10 minutes but I held out strong desperately hoping for something, anything to make the movie worth the money, but there was nothing. Please please stop giving this movie good reviews. I would have for more people to come on this site, see the movie recommended, and then waste two hours of their lives and want to kill themselves out of pure boredom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Souring and Breakdown of Relationships 2006</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2001 there was a cute little Italian film 'L'ultimo bacio' that was a comedy of sorts about infidelity and the approach/avoidance conflict of relationships. As written by Gabriele Muccino it was a smart, sassy, genuinely entertaining movie. Now as adapted by Paul Haggis and directed by Tony Goldwyn as THE LAST KISS it becomes a sour, fatiguing, shallow examination of life and 'love' in the year 2006. The result is a fairly depressing movie, almost devoid of comedy, and a sad commentary on relationships.Michael (Zach Braff) lives with Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), avoiding marriage until an unplanned pregnancy changes their outlook. They announce their upcoming event to Jenna's parents Anna (Blythe Danner) and Stephen (Tom Wilkinson) who on the surface are delighted: below the surface brews a thirty-year marriage that has been anything but happy.There is a wedding party attended by Michael and Jenna and a cadre of Michael's old school chums: lothario Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen), unhappily married Chris (Casey Affleck), and jilted Izzy (Michael Weston). At the wedding Michael meets college sophomore Kim (Rachel Bilson) and a seduction begins. It seems the only happy couple in the story, Michael and Jenna, are threatened and indeed they are as Michael succumbs to Kim's advances and Jenna's discovery of the tryst leaves Michael on the street pondering his future. And all the rest is subplots of how each of these unhappy people copes with messy lives.There is some fine acting here: it would be difficult to not have good performances with the likes of Blythe Danner, Tom Wilkinson, and even Zach Braff on the set. But the plodding storyline varies from screaming sessions to passion-for-the-moment sessions and leaves little to admire about any of the characters. It is a sad summary of contemporary life and for this viewer it misses the boat. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The creative, idiosyncratic spark that elevated 2004's "Garden State" is rather lacking in Zach Braff's latest starring vehicle, a decidedly old-school dramedy with a new-fangled soundtrack. Granted he does not direct and write his latest. This time, actor Tony Goldwyn directs and Paul Haggis wrote the screenplay, and it has the familiar multi-character, stacked-deck approach that Haggis' script for "Crash" has. Unfortunately, this 2006 film also reflects the more pedestrian style Goldwyn exhibited with the 2001 Ashley Judd rom-com, "Someone Like You" than his textured work in his more impressive debut, 1999's "A Walk on the Moon".The plot revolves around four buddies nearing thirty, all grappling with growing up and moving to the next stage of their lives. The main focal point is Michael, an architect whose longtime girlfriend Jenna's unexpected pregnancy has him questioning his readiness for marital domesticity. The opening dinner scene where they announce their intentions to her parents is a terrific set-piece of nervous ambivalence and guarded enthusiasm. The film then has Michael facing the dilemma of an unsettling attraction to a comely coed Kim, whom he meets at a friend's wedding. Their burgeoning attraction is strictly all by-the-numbers, especially the necessary deceptive elements of it.Meanwhile, the clownish Izzy, unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend, cannot move on and decides to buy a used RV to travel to Tierra del Fuego. Already married with a baby, Chris regrets his commitments, as he cannot cope with his shrewish wife and constantly crying baby. As the least ready for any kind of commitment, hedonistic Kenny seems to find the ideal woman with similar sensibilities until she wants to introduce him to her parents. As an obvious counterpoint to Michael and Jenna's inevitable crisis, her parents Anna and Stephen face a mid-life crisis which forces Anna to seek solace from a former lover. But it is Michael's deceptive quagmire that takes up most of the film's running time, and the last ten minutes amount to a wonderfully executed sequence (the sandwich drop is a nice touch).Forced by the script to be rather elliptical in character, Braff comes across as more passive and frustrating than likable as Michael, especially as the story moves along. Jacinda Barrett gets to show more colors as Jenna, but the movie never explores how her character's puritanical nature may have contributed to Michael's wandering eye. As Kim, Rachel Bilson does what she can to make her youthful character compelling, but again her character is rather simplified to what our initial impression of her is. Michael Weston (Izzy), Eric Christian Olsen (Kenny) and helium-voiced Casey Affleck (Chris) play the other guys to their accustomed stereotypes, but Haggis's script doesn't allow us more than a cursory look at their dilemmas, especially Chris's where it seems his wife has a pretty solid case for her sour demeanor.Not too surprisingly, Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner add much-needed gravitas to the movie, though I have to admit Wilkinson seems to be repeating much of his performance as an impassive husband from Todd Field's "In the Bedroom". Danner, however, has been allowed more depth here than most of her big-screen appearances, and she seizes most of her moments, even if her implied affair with Harold Ramis is given short shrift. This movie will likely attract those who think they will be seeing a romantic comedy, but what they will see is a hodgepodge of male maturity issues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the trailer lied</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer is one big lie. That's the first thing to realize. It is not the film you picture in your head--that film I dare say would be much better. I'm trying to think of a way to describe it. Above all, it strikes me as a failed attempt at making the guy equivalent of a chick flick. The only problem is that while the vapid loneliness of the chicks portrayed in chick flicks is grading, the moral repugnance of the men in this film degrades the women they supposedly love or at least make love to. All in all the film would be worlds better if it didn't suffer from a unbelievable lack of subtext. Also, the cinematography struck me as amateurish; the angles, the depth of field, and frame choices were poorly chosen. There was even a scene in the beginning of a film where they broke the 180 degree line, and not in a purposeful way. The acting wasn't terrible. I guess at least the soundtrack was good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ew."The Last Kiss" thinks it is "The Graduate," an up-to-the minute, profound, truth-telling film about love and life.What it is is stupid, ugly, patronizing drek.Its "band of brothers," a group of guys who watch each other's backs, is as phony as a three dollar bill.One, a slacker who lives for anonymous flings, is much better looking than that type of guy is in real life -- he has the body of a 'roid-injecting, carb-shunning, gay stripper.One is meant to be the endearing guy who can't move on from his last relationship; in fact he is a creepy stalker who could, without any change to hair, makeup, or whiney voice, star in his own "Friday the 13" style horror films.The "decent one" in the clique dumps his wife just after she has given birth to their son. Counseling? Therapy? He doesn't bother. He just dumps her. And, remember, he's the decent one.In any case, not a single character in this movie makes any sense at all. Blythe Danner leaves her husband for no reason, and then reunites with him for no reason.Rachel Bilson is supposed to be a teenager -- ! -- who "falls in love with" Zach Braff, who is supposed to be much older. Bilson is no teenager and she can't pass for one. She and Zach Braff are not that much different in age. Bilson's personal total lack of charisma is made even creepier by her trying to pass as a teenager and a younger woman.I could go on pointing to the utterly illogical garbage that passes for plot in this mess, but suffice it to say that every ten minutes or so, like clock work, the movie shows you some woman naked.Okay, you're thinking, maybe I should see this movie. If you are thinking that, then this movie was made exactly for you -- someone who will believe garbage dialogue is profound, lousy acting is profound, and a pointless plot is profound, as long as every ten minutes, like clockwork, you get to look at a naked woman.Here's a thought -- why not just stay at home and surf the internet? This movie is so bad that sitting at home pathetically taking in internet porn is a veritable feast for the soul in comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Kiss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Kiss is a remake of the 2001 Italian film of the same name. The movie is about a group of best friends in their twenties who each are having a midlife crisis and don't know what they are going to do in the future with their relationships with the women they love and how they are going to face the things that come with marriage, having children, buying a house and other things we face as we get older and fall in love. The film focuses on the men finding themselves interested in other women, not sure of what they really want and in the end what they want to do with their lives. The movie also focuses on a middle age couple and how they handle their rocky relationship. The Last Kiss has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast and good original music. This past year I have already seen The Break Up a film about a couple who are thinking about breaking up and overall it wasn't a very good movie, but now we finally get a great movie about relationships and about the choices we have to make in the future. The performances in this film were all great and the direction and script (even though it was adapted from the earlier film) were also very good. The characters in this film were all very likable and believable characters and I for one could relate to things going on in their lives and things they said and I think a lot of people whether you are a young adult to middle age will be able to relate to this movie in some way and it may remind you of the fears and decisions you have had to make in your own life. I also felt for the characters and even though they made mistakes and did things that may not have been the best you still care for these characters and like them and hope that somehow things will manage out for them in the end. The film kept my interest for the entire running time of the movie and I really got compelled into this movie and the different characters. The film has a few comedic moments that work quite well and the dramatic moments are played out very well and are very realistic and at times represent people and life very well. I also found this to be a very honest movie and I liked how the movie didn't sugar coat things and make everything happy and like a family movie ending and without being too sappy or melodramatic. For being a movie that is entertaining, well made, well acted and that is a movie that is easy to relate to and for being such an honest and realistic film I really loved this movie. The Last Kiss is one of the best films of the year and I hope that the age group that this movie is intended for (both young adult and middle age) will see it and find it as rewarding an experience as I have.</fullReview>

It's essentially a movie about human relationships. The story, however, could have been more coherent if the side plots were more developed. By the end, you get the point the movie is trying to make, but the minor plots could have contributed to it better. The scene when Michael waits on the porch for forgiveness was appropriately emotive for a climax. A dialogue that I remember from this one:'You can't fail if you never give up.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Last Kiss (2006): Dir: Tony Goldwyn / Cast: Zach Braff, Jacinda Barrett,Tom Wilkinson, Blythe Danner, Rachel Bilson: Observant romance regarding moving from one faze of life to another. Zach Braff plays an architect turning thirty and feels life grinding to a halt when his girlfriend becomes pregnant. Her parents have their own issues regarding communication. His friends are reluctant to settle down and seek escape. Director Tony Goldwyn is backed with a screenplay that detail the character well. This is a huge improvement over films such as Someone Like You where relationships and intelligence are distant strangers. Excellent performance from Braff who struggles with infidelity with a college student who seems to promise freedom. Braff will take huge measures to prove himself. Jacinda Barrett plays his trusting girlfriend. Her parents are played by Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner. Wilkinson plays a counselor whose marriage is in trouble because he lacks good communication skills. Danner is a veteran of it all but must decide whether years of marriage is worth saving. Rachel Bilson steals her moments playing the female for whom Braff has the affair with. Strong message regards the unwillingness or reluctance to settle down and the reality that choices bring responsibility as Braff learns long after that forbidden last kiss.

Of course you will feel differently about the Remake and like it much more than my rating is suggesting at the moment. But if you take my advise you might see where I'm going with this.While Zach and others are doing a decent job, you'd expect the movie to capture the essence way better than it actually does. If you have seen Garden State you might even be disappointed by the lack of effort (or at least it feels like a lack).

		<fullReview>I don't know how this could have anything but an excellent rating! This movie is so well written, directed, and acted! It is so realistic and true to everyday relationships and the true nature of them and how we react to them, and in them. As a middle aged woman, I can truly relate in part to nearly every single character in the movie, and appreciate their perspective! It is also full of hilarious rhetoric between friends! The emotion, whether happy, sad, sexy, etc. is entirely believable and well acted and draws you in to caring about the relationships, as well as relating to all of them in different ways. I enjoyed every minute of this film, including the out of the ordinary, but extremely fulfilling ending. Each actor did a fantastic job, and with this cast, that isn't surprising. As much as I appreciate the authenticity and realism in this movie, the humor is equally enjoyable. Very witty, moving, funny, sad, everything you could ask for in a great movie!

		<shortDescription>As perfect as a movie as Jenna is as a girlfriend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last Kiss" had a lot of potential, at least judging from the trailer and the synopsis. I love this movie genre and I liked "Garden State", so I decided to give this a try, but, unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed almost from the beginning.I have read a lot of reviews saying that this movie portraits life as it is for couples in their late twenties, but I just could not feel the connection. According to this script, all women are either shameless, needy or simply maniac while all men seem immature and stupid.First, I don't know a lot of women who would flirt openly with a complete stranger at a wedding and then still encourage any type of connection after they know he had a girlfriend. I have read many people who feel sorry for Kim's character, but, really, what could she expect? This doesn't mean that Michael was right in any way, shape or form, but their connection seems just too forced and unreal. Unfortunately, it was the main plot of the movie, so it fails flat right there.Second, what was the point of that awful scene where Jenna starts freaking out and screaming at Izzy's house right after his father dies just because she thinks her boyfriend MIGHT be cheating on her? How can Jenna be described as the "perfect" girlfriend at any point, really? I can only see a needy, self-centred, immature and maniac brat. God forbid if that is the definition of a perfect girlfriend! What type of "good" person would be so disrespectful? Wouldn't it make a little more sense to leave and wait for your boyfriend to come back and then talk things over in private? What good does it make to scream your heart out, act like you have just run away from a mental hospital and threaten your boyfriend with a knife? Maybe it's just me, but, especially considering that she was pregnant, wouldn't it be preferable to break things up if they were not working any more and, I don't know, maybe think a bit more of the well-being of her child? I don't know a lot of people who would react like that in real life, and even if they would, I'm certain they would never have been universally praised as "perfect".Considering her mother also acts like a teenage girl even though she seems to be well into her 60s, maybe the point of the movie is really just to show how the world is a difficult place when you're a spoilt brat.All in all, I didn't feel this movie was realistic in any way. In real life, people try to deal with their problems as well as they know. Of course they screw up and make mistakes, but, at least from my experience, they either sit down and talk about or accept that things can't be fixed and move on with their lives as best as possible. That is what being an adult means, I think.Here you look at a series of characters who have no idea what they are doing and seem to insist on being miserable for no particular reason. Perhaps that was exactly the point of the movie and there are a lot of people who can relate to it, but I just couldn't relate to it.</fullReview>

It made me sick, really, how people toy around with each other and then say they're sorry etc. I've never written a review to a movie before, but this time I just felt I have to say - don't watch this! Unless you're a teenager who likes to watch unstable "grown-ups" in movies. I don't know, it was just so bad. I've seen bad movies before but none of them made me so angry at the characters. Nothing funny or romantic about it. These characters are horrible. I wanted to end my review but seems that I have to write at least 10 lines to submit this. Alrgiht, well, the most normal guy was the one who wasn't shown a lot and most of the time he was having sex with someone. He probably had mental issues like everyone else too but they just didn't show them. Okay I think this is enough now. Don't watch this movie.</fullReview>

It's not great or anything, but it's engrossing, and believable in the actions and emotions of its supporting characters, and there are some nail-biting scenes as various relationships are threatened, and it has Blythe Danner in it, which never hurts.What does hurt the movie somewhat is the credibility void at its centre. Zach Braff is a charming actor and I've got a lot of time for him, but his character here is so subdued and disconnected that I didn't believe that immature college girl Rachel Bilson would give him the time of day, let alone pursue him to the point of stalking and constantly tell him how amazing he is.

		<shortDescription>A film that gets there but not quite yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW SHOULD BE READ BY THOSE WHO'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THE MOVIE There are a lot of films that deal with mid-life crises in their own ways. Some come out great, some totally miss the point. But every now and then a film tries, and falls short. This is "The Last Kiss".What the writers and the director did for this movie pretty much reflects what the Zach Braff character said at the end of the movie, where the couple should at least try to make things work. I think that's what this movie tried to do as well.It's unfair to compare movies, therefore I won't go there. But this movie itself, was missing something. Maybe it needed to be longer, maybe it needed to a series, or a 2-part movie in order to delve into the characters and their issues a little bit more, but I feel like with the set-up they gave us at the beginning of the movie, this film could have done a lot more, had there been more time for it to do. It could have been better, because it had the potential but for whatever reason, the movie length was that length, and the choice of words coming out of Zach Braff's mouth (awful, just absolutely awful) were those words.This movie dealt with a good theme, and good initial story-lines but failed in its premise, and became too "movie-like" and less "real-world" if you know what I mean. This is an important point because that is what the movie was aiming at.And so for that reason, I'll give it a 2 out 4 stars. RIP Roger Ebert.</fullReview>

Zack Braff was good, but nowhere near good as he was in Garden State, and his character was childish, bad and just too unlikeable. His girlfriend, however, was plain terrible. I'm not sure if it was just bad acting on her part or the director's fault, but she sucked terribly. Rachel Bilson, unlike what I had expected, didn't stand out at all, but she wasn't terrible either.

		<shortDescription>My Take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I've been thinking about my life lately, and everything feels pretty planned out. There's no more surprises" ? this is the line of Zach Braff's character (Michael) in the movie The Last Kiss. And this is the line that almost took the love of his life, although it is the same line that made him realized that, yes - it is the love of his life.The Last Kiss is a movie about Love ? not romance. It is a movie about doing the right thing ? not the hot thing. It is a movie about Kindness being the source of True Love ? not passion or any commercialized cute adjectives.The Last Kiss is a honest take on the real perils of life ? in the same manner that it deals with surviving these perils and still achieving both true love and true life.In the movie, Zach Braff plays the character of Michael ? a twenty nine year old Architect who had a steady three years relationship with Jenna, who is three months pregnant and whom he's planning to marry. Everything seems smooth until Michael met Kim on his friends wedding. Kim is a sexy, free-spirited college chic (played by Rachel Bilson) who's hard to refuse if you're on Michael's pants, err, shoes.Both Michael and Jenna are surrounded with people dealing with difficulty of having a relationship be it a new or a thirty year old marriage. Michael's friend and co-worker Chris is full and fed up on his neurotic wife, Izzy who can't let go of his childhood sweetheart, and the handsome stud Kenny who is afraid of commitment. Jenna's parents on the other hand are almost on the brink of separation ? thanks to his father's Kindness (not understanding ? yes, this movie made me realized that it is not enough to understand the mistakes of the people around you, but to be kind enough to embrace these people, and accept and let go of the mistake ? the act that they committed).These situations added pressure on their relationship. As if it is no longer possible to live a life that is shaped by love, trust and commitment. Michael made the mistake. He chose to make that mistake. He also chooses to correct that mistake. The same mistake that Jenna's mother committed three years ago. Their lives did not end after committing these mistakes. It only started there.In the end, Michael and Jenna started ? again. This time they know better. They Love better. They will eventually live better.MY TAKE The movie's tagline is about making choices, and the good thing on this movie is that it provided honest inputs for the audience to ponder the better side of choices. The movie also put Love on its rightful place. Jenna's father, played by Tom Wilkinson is heart-warming. Some of my favorite lines from him are:Stop talking about love. Every asshole in the world says he loves somebody. It means nothing. It still doesn't mean anything. What you feel only matters to you. It's what you do to the people you say you love, that's what matters. It's the only thing that counts. (If you want something) Do whatever it takes. You can't fail if you don't give up. People know the truth. They may not like it or want to know it, but they always know. Lie and you'll lose her.Aside from the consistency of the story and the cast's brilliance ? the soundtrack complimented every scene which makes the movie more delightful to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Script and Dialog - So-So Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another turd of a script pooped out by Paul Haggis, "The Last Kiss" is not quite as poor as "Crash"'s script, is still a real turd. The sappy sitcom situations drawn up are contrived and forced replete with characters double-tracking, forgiving and screaming over and over again. To top it all off there's the clichéd "I'm growing older" wedding whining and soupy throughout. Lead Zach Braff in a similarly aloof goony character whom no one can identify with as in "Garden State" only this movie is not up to the task and unfocused comparatively to Garden State. We have too many characters and melodrama enough for 3 movies in this crud. Why did Tom Wilkerson stoop to the level of being in this horrid material. It's Grey's Anatomy sitcom clichéd crap. Wholly bad....Give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the 4 phases of what guys and relationships are all about..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is a nice film about the troubles of relationships guys have against women. this isn't your typical romantic comedy i don't think, because there are some powerful scenes including Zach Braff that really capture what a guy is really feeling/going through. the plot and acting were fair and everything else was pretty solid...i don't feel there is nothing you can be disappointed about since all the roles including the guys and women were pretty realistic and carried out well. This film was interestingly crafted, since all the characters i feel were given each problem that guys typically have, which was great. Overall if you are interested in what relationships are all about and want to find a cute movie between a guy and girl then this is pretty much it except it can be a little more mature since it involves marriage and babies. I recommend "Adventureland" for teenage romantic insight. A must see if your going through a relationship and want to know what its going to be like...for example, I was "Izzy" at one point..and now i'm a "Kenny" probably going to be a "Micheal" and in the end going to be a "Chris"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>JD says the 'f word'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This review contains spoilers"I, like many others I imagine, watched 'The Last Kiss' on the strength of 'Garden State' - a likable little movie that shares the same star Zach Braff. The similarities end there for The Last Kiss is an unsympathetic look at what happens when a 30 year old (Braff as Michael) chases one last fling to avoid the less attractive reality of a long term relationship with a pregnant woman (Jacinda Barrett) who actually, you know - expects him to behave like an adult. Enter Rachel Bilson, perfectly cast as the brunette temptress Kim who could offer a less final and responsible alternative.Michael's friends (though the film never convinces us that their ties run any deeper than attending the same schools) are also painfully suffering from their own assortment of commitment issues. There's the one married with child, the adulterous handsome one and the heart-broken loser of love. Tellingly each of these characters are infinitely more likable than the whiny, self-pitying Braff though there stories are anemically sparse in comparison. No one it seems is capable of a shred of happiness but their collective misery is at least slightly entertaining.The Last Kiss is a manipulative, insultingly simplified "drama" that is geared to sell off the already established 'Braff image' - you know, the deep thinking tortured soul who just needs his hair stroked by 'the one' (so long as she's ridiculously hot of course). In the films climax (or groan) Braff, having been locked out of the house by his spurned partner, waits and pines on the porch for just one chance of forgiveness. This involves heroically braving the rain, sleeping against the front door, relying on the neighbours for a sympathetic glass of water and all the while sound tracked with the laboured sentiments of Coldplay just to really hammer it home. You see, even when Braff plays a cheating misanthrope - he's still you know, heroically cool.He's not the only offender, Jacinda Barrett as his parter Jenna takes a lumpen script and somehow makes it sound even worse. When the two do finally square off it should have been the dramatic centre piece, it turns out to be in-appropriate and terribly unconvincing. Jenna pulls out a kitchen knife and charmingly proclaims she hopes Michael would 'catch AIDS'. JD, sorry Michael, retorts with possibly the most unintentionally comical sequence of expletives in cinematic history.The conflicts in failing relationships were portrayed infinitely better in 'Closer' so there is little reason in watching this damp squid of a drama.</fullReview>

I mean maybe 15+ ..... but the only greatest thing i liked in the film was Zach Braff ..... he surely was great looking and also was great in acting.the direction was great ..... with a not so great screenplay .... the background music was really good .... rest of the things are just okay- okay type overall the film can be seen once for Zach and his friends especially that troubled friend</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood, for lack of originality, sometimes resorts to remake European film hits. Alas, those efforts can be a hit or a miss, as it never can outdo something that was perfect before. While credit must go to Tony Goldwyn and the adapter of the original material, Paul Haggis, for the way they make it palatable for American audiences, some of the enjoyment is lacking in the finished product. Part of the blame is that some of the characters in this version are people one wouldn't like to meet in the first place.The story follows the Italian version of 2001 pretty much. This tale centers around four friends that, for all practical purposes, have refused to grow to accept their new realities. That seems to be what happened to Chris and his disenchanted wife. They find themselves in no-win situation with a child they probably weren't counting on. Whatever they thought about their marriage, is not working out.Michael who is fully aware what Chris is going through, has a good relationship with Jenna, his girlfriend, with whom he is living. To complicate things, Michael meets Kim at a wedding. She clearly knows about him, so he feels flattered by the attention this attractive woman, although younger, shows him. Little prepares him when Jenna tells him she's pregnant, something that he didn't expect. While her parents are elated, Michael begins an affair with the beautiful Kim, something that will change his life completely.The American cast on this remake is fairly attractive. Zach Braff, a personable actor who keeps reminding this viewer of a young Dustin Hoffman is a charmer that has proved he has talent to spare. His Michael goes through a gamut of emotions. Equally good is Jacinda Barrett, a personable and gorgeous actress that always delivers. Casey Affleck and Rachel Bilson play Chris and Kim showing sensitive to the material. The older cast includes the excellent Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson, two people that are a welcome addition to any film. Harold Ramis, the director, has a small role.We look forward to more things from director Tony Goldwyn, hoping he finds the right original material in which to show the range which he is capable of giving an audience to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not going to "last"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a pretty stereotypical, 20-something friends "come-of-manhood in marriage, relationships with women and selves" sort of film, loosely inspired by woody Allen marital dramatics and ruminations on extra-marital affairs. It probably only gathered the money to be made on the strength of leading man Zach braff's garden state success, but in this movie is acting is pretty much exactly as it was in that movie: wooden, awkward. This film however has no storyline about a childhood of lithium-induced emotional deadness or over-prescription on drugs to rationalize that, though.Film has a pretty good cast - even features drama between an older couple. But generally the plot is unrealistic and poorly written. A lot of the plot devices seemed poorly thought of, like someone based this on an idea they had while eating a bagel, or it was based on real-life events, but re-done around some do-it-yourself screen writing guide's tips on structure and etc. And the ending is terrible. It just all seems like it wouldn't really happen - Rachel bilson's horny co-ed is especially bad. 'oh no, Zach braff has gone to a crazy college party. he's lusting for this girl, but afraid of this world. he should just stick with his wife.' thats how it begins, and little changes. Jacinda Barret gives it her all as Zach's wife, but frankly, her scenes are painfully bad to watch. but at least tom Wilkinson has a cool accent, standing in for Ian holm as father figure. Also, weird bad soundtrack.However, why did I watch this movie? Two reasons, one called Casey affleck and one called Michael weston. Michael weston, well-remembered as the insane hitch-hiker who tortures Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under, has his usual crazy presence and is always fun to watch perform. His story is endearing and sympathetic. Casey Affleck, an actor who's been really coming into his own lately, is great - his role, I believe, is the most believable, and thus his ending is the most painfully dissatisfying and irritating. But maybe in years to come this film will be remembered by people wanting to watch young Casey.6/10, barely above 5, doesn't really deserve to be watched unless you're totally bored and alone and have literally NOTHING to do but watch this on HBO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm only giving this movie a 5, because it has a reasonably high production value and cinematography, etc. But, the movie was marketed as a comedy about relationships, and it ends up being a soap opera about relationships that are failing.After being through my own breakups in my life, I really didn't want to watch a movie centering around 4 breakups. But even worse was the yelling; there are plenty of good movies that have breakups that are sensibly acted and the actors aren't simply yelling at each other. Sure, I realize emotions are high in these situations and they are trying to be "true to life" but it was just overkill.In all, I felt like the writer recently went through a divorce and a custody battle, and was just trying to get their feelings out on screen. It was simply depressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Realistic and Moving Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know much about adult relationships, but whilst watching this movie I actually felt like I did. If the film makers were trying to make a movie that was thoroughly realistic, then they just about succeeded. None of the relationships in this movie have entirely smooth endings. Characters struggle with their inner emotions as they enter the unknown territories which make up adulthood. All of this and more combines to make a thoroughly entertaining and interesting movie. One of the best aspects of the movie is the screenplay. Written by Oscar-winner Paul Haggis, the dialogue is always 100% realistic, but also has flexibility on a scale that is not often found in a relationship movie. Haggis makes situations that could easily be overdone seem completely rooted in reality (a bedroom conversation, a wedding party, a group of friends watching two lesbian prostitutes having sex), yet manages to lend good jokes to these situations without losing the humanity involved. Haggis also makes it easy to identify with the characters. A man's infatuation with a beautiful girl leads him to decide that he needs a very, very long vacation, whilst his friend, who has been having a bit of fun with a girl (shown in the most explicit sex scenes in the movie), discovers that she thinks their relationship is serious, and does a runner for it. These are both situations that quite a few people have experienced, and the characters in the movie accept these situations in the same way that a normal human being would. However, Haggis doesn't shy away from the nasty sides of the characters in the movie. Braff's character makes some incredibly selfish and foolish decisions about his future. The reason why Haggis' script excels is that he paints the characters thoroughly grey. They aren't innocent, yet they aren't all out scumbags. I thoroughly respected Haggis' screenplay largely due to this fact. The acting is also top-notch. Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner excel in their roles as the struggling parents of the films main female character (Jacinda Barrett, giving a superbly quirky and touching performance). Even though I have watched a couple of episodes of "Scrubs", I wasn't entirely sure about how Zach Braff would pull off his performance as the lead in the movie. I am glad to say that I was happily surprised by his performance. Even though his work here is nothing groundbreaking, he still gives a very good, as well as vivid performance. And, whereas other actresses may have come across as lifeless or bland, Rachel Bilson gives life and energy to the college student temptress who causes the films hero to risk losing his girlfriend. The direction is fantastic. The director is a man called Tony Goldwyn, who I hadn't heard of until I saw the movie. But he does superbly well, nonetheless. He and Haggis make the characters' dilemmas gripping and difficult, and Goldwyn also manages to stage many of the movies scenes with unexpected flourish (the scene where Braff's character finally loses all resistance and has sex with Bilson's character is incredibly well shot and directed), without allowing any of them to go over the top. This is a impressive movie, but it has one major flaw. There is a brilliant build-up to the films ending, but when it finally arrives, it feels rushed and doesn't show what eventually happens to the main characters, whereas the supporting characters all have immensely satisfying climaxes before them. However, apart from that, this is an intellectual, moving and realistic movie that is much better and much more intelligent than most relationship dramas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed garden state and so unsurprisingly thought this would be a good flick to catch along similar lines. Unfortunately, the script in this movie is weak, there is poor chemistry between the actors and there is a glaring plot hole. While zach graff doesn't look like Quasimodo, there is no way a very sexy college girl is going to run up to him at a wedding and want to get his phone number and basically be all over him when a) she's very hot and could get any man she wants to b) he told her straight off the bat he had a girlfriend and c) i could maybe picture this if he was dressed very well and there was a chance encounter but this was her pursuing him. (sorry women just don't behave like this!) That aside, graff and barrett lacked a spark and I ended up not caring what happened to them. The producers probably realized this and tried to create some sub plots for his friends and the girlfriend's mum but this began to detract from the main point of the story and again, characters were not developed enough to make you care anyway. It was touching at the end to see him camped outside but even then the way she ultimately took him back left an unsatisfied taste in the mouth. This movie was a classic case of producers and writers being complacent and not going the extra mile or maybe graff should write, star in and direct all his own movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge "Scrubs" and Zach Braff fan, and after having been told "The Last Kiss" was a must-see, I finally got around to sitting down and watching it. I will say right now that everything you think will happen, does. There isn't much in the way of twists when it comes to this movie, but it finds a way to fight through the clichés and remain very solid. Behind a solid lead performance by Zach Braff as a 29-year-old suffering a premature midlife crisis, and the OC's Rachel Bilson as a hot college girl who throws herself into (Braff's) Michael's life, the movie manages to remain sincere and not as cliché as it would appear on paper. The very strong supporting cast includes Blythe Danner as Michael's girlfriend's (Jacinda Barret) mother, and his occasionally psychotic group of friends includes Erik Chrisian Olsen, Michael Weston, and the very good Casey Afleck. Although you know from the first time Bilson's Kim appears that Michael is going to cheat, you hold out hope that he will stay loyal. Like I said, it is a very predictable film but still manages to seriously entertain viewers for 90 minutes.</fullReview>

Lots of men cheat on their wives, very sad of course, and some want them back, and say sorry, and do anything, but you have to face it, you cheated on them, and you can't get them back! Well in this movie, you never find out, and that's what makes this movie kinda bad, because I really wanna know if she takes him back or not, and that's what makes me not like this movie too much. When I was watching this, I thought all the characters where great, and they did an amazing job on acting, one of the best acting I've seen in movies.

		<fullReview>The emotion and crisis these characters went through can only be truly understood by the people who had pretty much the same experiences. I've been there, I went through the similar things when i was 27, and I really enjoyed this movie as a play back of my own memories.The final commitment that the main characters made, which is about being MMMG(married, mature, monogamous and good), is a very important step in a man's live. As far as i know, really very few people understand what that is all about. Albert Einstein and W. S. Maugham must understand the idea of this movie, since they are the same type of person as the main character, except that Maugham is gay. Many people think that understand it, especially those guys with a very simple mind and lacks imagination. But unless you go through a violence phase in your relationship or figure out the whole thing in agony sometime early in your life, you just can't understand the idea of being MMMG. The movie goes quite deeply into this, and I appreciate the writer/director's intention to deliver this message.But there are still two problems that kills this movie. The first problem is that these guys are really stupid. Either these guys are spoiled, or they have not quite outstanding IQs. I guess it will be hard to find a community of idiots like this in reality (better than babel though, which is an idiot-show). The second problem is that the phase of turning into a MMMG is usually quite subtle, which is not precisely, or even hardly remotely, captured in this movie. What a shame.Overall, good movie with flaws. I like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good? Bad? How about... Inconsistent?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if I liked this movie or not! Some parts were amazingly REAL and the acting was, for the most part, really spot-on! However, other parts in the movie are too extreme or not believable. For example, in one scene between Michael and Jenna, when she is telling him to get out of the house (and I don't blame her!), she breaks out a freakin' butcher knife and shakes it at him pretty convincingly. Now, I don't know about you, but if I did that, no matter WHAT the circumstances, I'd never be able to live that one down... (and not to mention the legal consequences of such if ever charges were pressed.) And the Kim character is ridiculous. I do believe Rachel Bilson plays the character as written, but she's not written well. I mean, let's face it, Zach Braff is cute, but he's really only cute because of his mannerisms and self-deprecating nature... if you saw him on the street, you're not gonna lust after him. But a hot young college cutie out-of-the-blue taking every step known to all stalkers in order to bag Braff's character Michael? She came on so immediately strong that, at first, I thought she was hired by Jenna to "test" her man's commitment to her! Seriously! And then, knowing he has a girlfriend, still calls him late at night just to come over and "talk." Now, COME ON. Even college girl stalker-types understand the definition of discreet?? Right? Maybe I'm just too old.And finally, I can dig a good love/sex scene, but the only steamy sex scene in this film is the one where Michael is cheating on his PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND with Kim! I was disgusted by this scene and turned my head away. I've been a neglected pregnant girlfriend before, and I don't care HOW hot Rachel Bilson's backside is, I feel that scene was rude and thoughtless to be the scene to turn people on... there should have AT LEAST been another sex scene to equal it... and one between characters who actually CARED about each other! Why does "hot" always have to mean "cheap?!" Makes no sense to me...Otherwise, this movie was GREAT.. I truly did enjoy watching it. It was just completely inconsistent. One minute, I was applauding the film; the next, I was rolling my eyes or turning my head... a very strange couple hours, indeed.~Jen</fullReview>

I liked how the mother really explained to her daughter that she couldn't possibly understand what it takes to be together for thirty years. My own mother who has been married almost thirty years is constantly reminding me of the effort it takes. I though Braf's character was an asshole. I felt really bad for Rachel Bilson's character.

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie, and I'm not quite sure what to think. This is in no way a knock on the movie. The story arc was interesting and the acting was quite good. However, I'm just not sure that the story was quite sure what it wanted to do. Realistically, there are five main characters, and those stories seem to be reasonably well laid out. However, the story lines of Michael's friends seem a little out of place. Perhaps they are interesting stories, perhaps they contributed to the greater storyline, but they felt exceptionally out of place at times.The acting in this movie was pretty good. Zach Braff played Andrew Largeman further in life, equally insecure and unknowing. Frankly, it seems like a character he could play in his sleep. Jacinda Barrett was very good, except some of the emotional scenes seemed somewhat over-the-top at times. Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson played their roles very well, although nothing outside the normal realm for either actor. Rachel Bilson was a pleasant surprise and the way in which her character leaves seems a little hurried and leaves a bit of a bad taste in your mouth.I liked the movie, but it didn't feel like it was quite right. Whether that was the storyline, the editing or direction I'm not sure of. Its worth watching, but wasn't quite what I expected. 6.5/10</fullReview>

And some scenes I thought were very awkward:-His girlfriend brandishing a rather large knife against him. -His consequential decision to go back and sleep with the college girl after he "knew what he truly valued". -His last encounter with college girl at his office. -He never learns why he got busted (kinda important considering the circumstance / death). -Father-in-law (aka Robot Shrink) giving advice when its not clear he has any idea about how to show love to people. After all, didn't she cheat and leave him b/c he doesn't know how to show affection? They left this whole dilemma completely unresolved (again, just awkward). -Finally, his girlfriend leaving him stranded for 2+ days on the porch.Between his indecision (I love you, it was only a kiss, but let me go over for a quick bang later) and his girlfriends raging tantrums as a result. He's either going to wind up dead on the porch when he screws up in winter, or she's going to stab him 20 times in his sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a romantic comedy at all. I agree that it takes a realistic view of relationships. Zach Braff has a strong performance, but there are additional actors who are equally as powerful. There is quite a bit of nudity and strong language, but nothing that I found offensive. My only issue (and this may have been the writers intent) was that I felt no sympathy for Braff's character. The character seemed more like an insecure chicken sh!t then a confused young man trying to make sense of his life. This was not due however to Braff's acting he made the character very believable. I would recommend this movie, but beware it is such a true portrait of relationships that it can be awkward and even painful to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual story of cheating couples who seek redemption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched this on DVD with a teenager, and the best use of it was for us to periodically say, 'That's another example of how well-adjusted people do NOT behave.'Zach Braff is Michael, who finds out that his live in girlfriend, Jenna (Jacinda Barrett) is pregnant with their child. When they announce it to the parents, they hesitate a moment, but congratulations are in order. Then, soon after, Michael is attending a friend's wedding, hears the vows, and gets very cold feet, is he, at 30, ready for his life to be wrapped up and dictated by parenthood and life ever after with Jenna, who happens to be pretty and perfect.Things get very complicated when Rachel Bilson as Kim, a college student, follows him around and takes a keen interest during the wedding reception. Michael does nothing to encourage it, but finds himself wondering what it would be like.Casey Affleck is good as Chris, who is married with a young son, and we quickly find out that not everything is rosy.Blythe Danner as Anna and Tom Wilkinson as Stephen are good as Jenna's parents.The movie ends with a very good message, but leading up to it are lots of lying and cheating, lots of explicit sex, and foul language. Not one of my favorites.SPOILERS. Michael goes to meet Kim, only ends up kissing her, but gets caught in a big lie when there is an unexpected death. Jenna is so furious when she finds out, she chases him out, with a knife, and doesn't ever want to see him again. Distraught, he goes back to Kim, they have wild sex. When he gets to see Jenna again, and decides to tell her the truth, she becomes doubly angry. The saving dialog comes from the dad, when he explains that the 'feeling of love' is only important to one's self. What you do towards the object of your love is what counts. Michael camps out on Jenna's doorstep for several days, as a way to 'do whatever it takes' to convince her he has learned his lesson, and wants to spend his life with her. She finally takes him in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie yesterday and my emotions already calmed down but i steel feel a little sadness in my soul about our disappearing life, flowing away through our hands ... People is cruel often and they even don't understand it sometimes. They can hurt each other. But there's no theirs fault. It's in human nature. I can't take this part of life but it's truth. Life knows no justice. Good people suffers and their wounds will never recover completely. They have to forgive each other. They have to live with this pain. This movie about real life without clear love and easy-going relations. Its about problems mostly in every part of our being. Being a human is a painful. I see this main point in the movie. I saw it with 100% immersion into it. It's already something. We're just human and we will hurt innocent people and then they will hurt somebody else. It's sad truth of life. There's no way out of it. We have responsibility but we have weaknesses. We have love but we have temptations. We have everything but we have fears and boredom. Life is cruel and world is cruel. We just have to live it through. On the other side - its JUST a life.PS Sorry, friends, but my thoughts are not so clear because my English still very poor ... i'm working on it and soon it'll become better). And it's great movie to watch!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The DVD case refers to it as a comedy -- which it clearly is not. Some of the reviews listed referred to it as hilarious. Even the categorization on IMDb refers to it as a comedy (among other classifications). Those who think it's a comedy, need to seriously re-examine what comedy is.While the movie was well-done, it is hardly a comedy. It is at least 95% a drama. It is a thoughtful examination of relationships and the transitions of adult life. There is little about the movie that is light hearted. OK, so I chuckled once or twice, but I expect more than a few chuckles from a true comedy.Basically, while I generally liked the movie, it was not at all what I expected. The acting is good (not outstanding, but good), the story is not overly predictable, the characters are believable -- some even likable, but it's not a comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was hard to like this movie, and hard to not like it as well.If you pay attention to this very well acted movie, you will realize that it is about some very serious topics regarding inter-personal relationships between men and women(infidelity, for one) and that it ventures into territory that most chick-flicks have never gone and would never dare to. But if you simply watch it as a run of the mill 'guy and girl in love have crisis...problems and solutions ensue' type of movie you will get that too. Writer Paul Haggis has talent, there is no question, but how he was able to pack an adult drama into a chick-flick package, I will never know. But he did.This is serious fluff.</fullReview>

However, Braff gives an outstanding performance in The Last Kiss as middle-aged guy trying to figure out what he really wants in life. The thing I love most about this film is the fact that it's real. The film conquers any real problem that a couple could possibly go through whether it be cheating, or separation or commitment. Braff has also put together another stunning soundtrack with many unknown artists such as Jash Raidin and Cary Brothers. Actress Rachel Bilson co-starred in this film and being it her first feature film, I would say she made the transfer quite well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited a long time for this to come to video (my little town's theater didn't show it) and it was well worth the wait. This movie really hit home with me and I felt completely involved in the storyline. Some of the scenes between Zach and Jacinda made me feel like I was there... The acting was incredible- very real and powerful. Rarely do actors exhibit such raw vulnerability that viewers can actually 'feel'. I felt exhausted, emotionally drained and happy all at the same time and loved it. Casey Affleck was excellent as a friend going through his own hardship and realization. It was great to see him in a role that required more emotion and character depth. Blythe Danner was exceptional. The only thing I can think of that would have made this movie better was to work a little more on the regional dialect. It's set is Wisconsin, yet the characters didn't sound like they were from anywhere near there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Squeaks By As A Watchable "Guy" Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having enjoyed Zach Braff in GARDEN STATE, most viewers will eagerly snatch-up a copy of THE LAST KISS to see how far this young actor has come. Needless to say, Braff is still in fine form as far as his acting goes. In fact, the entire ensemble cast is excellent (from Blythe Danner as the embittered and confused wife of Tom Wilkinson, to Michael Weston's predatory antics toward his ex-girlfriend played by Marley Shelton). But acting needs a strong story, and this is where The Last Kiss stumbles badly.Relationship stories are often the groundwork for the inevitable "chick-flick." But here the story is on five men and how each of them deals with the challenges of the interpersonal relationships with their significant others. If this sounds a tad boring, you're not wrong. It is. But, as stated at the beginning of this review, it's the strong acting that'll keep you watching.The film starts out at a wedding of one of the five, an idyllic scene that contrasts sharply between what the other four are going through. Izzy (Michael Weston) is depressed and weepy because his long-time girl recently broke up with him. He deals with this situation by refusing to believe its over and crying at a bachelor party while watching two lesbians "go at it." Chris (Casey Affleck) is a married man with a new baby. He and his wife constant argue, and this upsets the baby who cries nonstop. Realizing that "something" has to happen, Chris takes the plunge and leaves his wife. Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) is the penultimate bachelor, working at a bar and getting laid on a regular basis. He can't (or won't) commit to anything resembling a relationship. Then there's our main character Michael (Zach Braff), who's been involved in a three year relationship with the perfect girl (who's also pregnant now). He's worried that his life is over, that nothing more is in store for him. No more surprises. His life is laid out for him. Until...Michael meets up with a sexy college co-ed named Kim (Rachel Bilson) who takes an immediate liking to him. The forbidden fruit dangles in front of Michael and one night he decides to pluck it, forgetting that this might permanently damage his three year relationship with his probable future wife. And, of course, it does do serious damage. Can he fix it? Are there still surprises left for Michael? Or should he reserve his life to that of commonality? And this is basically the entire premise of the flick. Although "interesting" it most certainly isn't engaging to ponder (at least not from a "guy" standpoint).Relationship stories are just too blah! to keep being resurrected time and again, and this is why The Last Kiss falters so badly. If it weren't for the stellar cast, this one would easily be forgettable and nearly unwatchable. But as it stands now, it's just barely worth your viewing time.</fullReview>

I absolutely loved how honest and real it was. It was very realistic to how people can really be and the ending I also liked. I know I read a lot of people's comments about the movie on here before seeing it and made me think it might not be that great...but it is a great movie. It is about people's relationships and how they can be very difficult and how people deal with them. It's also about forgiveness as well. It's from the co-writer of Crash...which is also an extraordinary movie that everyone should see if they haven't already. Overall just a great move, cast, acting, and everything else.

		<fullReview>I have read some of the comments about "The Last Kiss" recently posted. I agree that in a clinical, by the numbers way, this is not to be considered a movie that rises above being merely "good" and into the pantheon of greatness. We probably won't remember this movie as previous generations remember "The Graduate", "Slackers", and "Reality Bites." There are moments in "The Last Kiss" that are so saccharine and contrived as to possibly be a Zach Braff personal ad (look girls, I'm flawed but do the right thing in the end). I seriously had to look away at times. But I still love this movie. Forget about plot lines that go unfinished and Zach Braff's aforementioned vanity. Luckily, I am at the right point in my life as a twenty-four year old single guy who is putting off the rest of my life for a while. "The Last Kiss" didn't show me anything I didn't already know about, but seeing it on screen kind of opens it up for me. Each of the male actors was a little piece of my personality. The guy who got dumped and can't say goodbye when it is obviously over. The guy who bangs chicks as a way to feel alive and stops any real commitment before it starts. And the guy who is trying so hard to grow up and take responsibility, even though he's not ready, that he sabotages his own happiness. He is the most like me. In closing, "The Last Kiss" is a good movie, but if you are at that right moment in your life and if you are a guy, this is one of the best movies of the year. (And I've seen most of them.

		<shortDescription>Imitation Gray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love ambitious films and often forgive them for their flaws solely based on their strive to challenge ( and ultimately respect) their audience. But this one is tremendously ill conceived. I enjoyed Paul Haggis' "Crash" and actually would consider it a movie that strives for greatness and to a degree fails; however, it is in the end a poignant and challenging film that takes the often black-and-white ideas that people bring to notions of race relations and navigates the murky gray waters that reveal the complexity of the issue. "Crash"reveals the potentials for redemption in the individual characters lives and the catch 22 ideology that makes the possibilities for hope, the mere slivers of light, a blatant and beautiful driving force behind his film. However, I often felt that "Crash" felt more like a television show than a film, and while that sometimes benefited the narrative and the themes of the film it was also detrimental.Here, Haggis gives another film that feels like a television show and tries once again to navigate the murky gray waters, but this time the failings far outweigh the ambitions. The cinematography and the directing are quite poor. If one sees the film on DVD in a television format often times characters are almost entirely cut out of shots because they are separated by too much distance in the shot, so we simply see a corner of two peoples faces. This is not the fault of the director but it draws attention to the fact that all the shots consist of a series of close-ups, the film never makes use of its environments. It becomes quite boring visually over time. The director simply does not understand his script in the end or the subject matter.To return to Haggis, the worst thing about the film is the script, which was obviously never evolved and nurtured. This not to blame Haggis, but merely to suggest that in the end the reason the film falls flat is going to be blamed on the poor writing. Braff is not the best man for the job and often pulls out his comedic gesturing at the most inappropriate times detracting from serious moments of the film (ie as he fights with his girlfriend about his indiscretions). Bilson is totally wasted here. I have never really liked her, but thought she was quite good here. However, she is given a one-dimensional character and has little to work with. Ultimately, this film seems to confront the idea of people who feel trapped in their relationships. However, the central story of Braff's love triangle seems to drive the film, while the other stories are just excess fat that takes valuable screen time. None of the different stories advance one another in any way or compliment one another. The film cannot be called a meditation on its subject because it seems to try to force a plot on to the film. (Although, what has Braff or the audience really learned- or at least confronted- at the films close?).One of the producers said that "the film opens with a man getting married who has a seemingly perfect relationship". What? We see that character twice: at a bachelor party with two strippers, and at his wedding. Why on earth do we assume he is happy? He has one line of dialogue. This film doesn't explore anything or take a stance on anything. The fact that producer assumes that the audience will assume this character is happy reveals how flawed the film makers understanding of their subject really is. Isn't it a black and white notion to assume that someone who is married is content in their relationship? As though they have reached the finish line and snagged one for the long haul. In fact, isn't that sort of black and white ideal the very thing this movie is supposedly confronting? Simply put: See David Gordon Green's "All the Real Girls". It deals with the same themes and even ends in a similar fashion to this film. Green gets it and his work is a well crafted labour of love, this film is an unfocused mess that does not understand its characters, its own subject matter, or the genres that it is derived from</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deciding who you are and what you want isn't easy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Kiss could be compared to many other countless romantic comedies where a couple must decide who their relationship will work despite constant problems they face. However, Zach Braff leads a stellar cast and takes this film and genre to a more serious level which makes everyone ask if their life is really the way they want it.Michael (Zach Braff), has the ideal life. His "perfect" girlfriend Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), has discovered that she is pregnant and his has a well respected job. His friends Chris (Casey Affleck), Izzy (Michael Weston), and Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) have always been there since childhood and adding a sense of stability which Michael has always wanted. Good job, beautiful girlfriend, friends, what else could a man want? Well, it turns out a lot more. And Michael isn't the only one to realize that their lives are missing more then they first imagined.Everything for Michael changes when he meets Kim (Rachel Bilson) a college student who suddenly makes Michael realize that his life is almost too perfect. As a spark starts a fire, Kim unleashes a wave of fear and even regret as Michael realizes that he isn't sure if he is ready to be move on to the rest of his life. As Kim remarks shortly have their first meeting, everyone is moving so fast in their life that midlife crises start much sooner. Michael realizes this describes him.Micheal isn't the only one who faces a sudden life changing episode. Chris wants out of an emotionally draining marriage, Izzy is coming out of his own breakup which makes him realize he wants more out of life, while Kenny also sees that he is living a shallow life that circles around various empty relationships and his job at a bar. These four friends, all about to turn 30, see their lives for what they are and know they have to make some kind of change.More dramatic changes take place between Jenna's parents. Her mother Anna (Blyth Danner) and father Stephen (Tom Wilkinson) own marriage is about to fall apart after Anna realizes that after 30 years she has had enough. She moves out and attempts to make contact with an old flame who quickly informs her that he has moved on. Increasly alone, Anna and Stephen face the challenge that even 30 years isn't enough to give stability and promise happiness.What do we want? These are the questions that each of these characters much face in some various form. Its a question that only leads to more anger and even pain as Chris walks away from his marriage, Anna faces reality and realizes she can't be alone, and Michael does what he once thought was impossible. None of these characters are selfish in their own right. They each feel very real desires but the problem is that they, like real people, don't always know how to deal with them.The only negative aspect of the movie was the rather bland ending. After admitting to an affair with Kim, Michael camps outside the house that he and Jacinda share until she takes him back. Of course she does, but we don't really know if she really does or if their relationship will heal. Reality itself doesn't offer such nice conclusions all the time so maybe this was the point. However, more clarity of the situation between the two would have been better as well as with Kim who simply drops out of the movie towards the end and never shows up again.A lesson in modern day relationships, we are faced with the very real question of how do we share our lives with each other if we in the end don't know what we want. And do we ever really know? Maybe that is the real question.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great character-driven drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Kiss is a remake of the 2001 Italian film L'Ultimo Bacio. I have not seen it, so cannot compare the two. When judged on it's own, however, The Last Kiss is one hell of a great film.Comparisions to 2004's Garden State (written, directed and acted by Last Kiss star Zach Braff) are inevitable. Indeed, both films seem incredibly similar, yet completely different. So much in fact that many professional critics have dubbed this an "unofficial sequel" to Garden State, stating that this movie could show what happened to the characters in that movie a few years later.Where the movies strongly differ is that while Garden State dealt with the "discovery of love", The Last Kiss deals with "the doubting of love". Thus, some professional critics (while reviewing the film favorably) have labeled this film has having a pessimistic view on love. I don't agree.While one can't say that this is a joyful movie, hope inhabits it. The main focus of the movie is obviously the relationship between the newly-engaged Michael and Jenna (Zach Braff and Jacinda Barrett) but a lot of screen time and good scriptwriting is given to the supporting players, be it Jenna's parents, Michael's buddies, or of course temptation, in the form of the sweet Kim (Rachel Bilson).In short, The Last Kiss is a touching, honest drama, wonderfully adapted by screenwriter Paul Haggis (check out his other work) and featuring more-then-solid acting from it's main AND supporting cast. And from the opening shot full of walking legs to the hopeful ending, director Tony Goldwyn had me engaged.So, it may be a remake, but The Last Kiss nevertheless enters the realm of my favorite movies, as had Garden State before it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally do not understand why people were expecting a Garden State 2, Zach Braff is an extremely talented actor and as you can see from JD in Scrubs to Andrew Largeman in Garden State, he can clearly play different roles, easily.I originally went to see this film with a few friends, on the basis of seeing an amazing cast, I had not read much on the film, and was amazed with what I saw. It was in essence a way to pass the time that ended up showing me some of the most amazing things that I will need to know in the future.While the lighthearted comedy, at the start, is lost as the film matures, this is no problem as the actors ability to carry such serious roles on their shoulders is amazing, and as someone has previously said they 'shine through and create something amazing. The depth of plot in the film is brilliant and while Jacinda Barrets character Jenna is an amazing person, and you can see why Michael has fallen for her, you also see why he falters for Rachel Bilsons character.Besides the main storyline all the sub-plots involving Micheals friends, and Jenna's parents are worth paying attention to as while each is different in its own light the film stays its course of looking in depth at mid-life crises and how they can be avoided and why they occur.The film is a must see, it is warm and with the huge examples of real life events in real life circumstances everyone can draw something from the film, I recently went through what Michael went through, just with a different ending, so I myself drew a lot from this film.As a whole it was amazing and is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this film I can completely understand both the negative and positive feedback. I walked into this film thinking it was going to be a cutesy romantic comedy that maybe went a bit out of the box considering it starred Zach Braff. What you get is a quite emotional and realistic look at life and not exactly the sugary sweet romantic piece you expected. There were definitely scenes that were hard to endure emotionally but the truth is that I don't think there is one person who can't relate to one or more of the characters or the things they go through. As a film student past, I could appreciate the direction, the camera work, and some of the acting, but my friend who wanted to be entertained by a happy movie could have cared less and did not like the film. Overall, I think it was a great movie but you have to know what you are walking into. I'd say if you didn't like Unfaithful, Closer, and other movies with similar situations and raw emotion then don't bother seeing this movie. Otherwise, enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was somewhere in between a stereotypical mid-life crisis story and a very painful and extremely realistic mid-life crisis story. It's a less perfect version of Garden State that leaves you crying and sad instead of crying and happy, and where in Garden State the plot subtly revolved around the beginning of a relationship, here the plot blatantly revolves around the destruction of relationships. I think the movie would have been better if Braff had left out the subplot involving Jenna's parents, which felt forced. The acting and directing was great, I think Braff could become a great director in the near future, everyone's performance was dead on. The movie was basically a remake of an Italian movie by the same name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I'm a big fan of Zach Braff movies but this one was too all over the place for me. It tried to take the idea of different stories interweaving or .. something along those lines and mucked it up. It's a great movie with an interesting concept but it was very poorly executed. 'Fraid to say, I thought to myself halfway through 'what's the point of this?' Enjoyed it, but it needs more conclusion or a more thorough and better explained plot, or dare I say it, a better script. Maybe I'm just too simple to understand this 'complex' plot, but what ever happens to Kenny and Izzy? Do they find some spiritual awakening in Mexico? What about Izzy and his girlfriend? Would Lisa really turn from some overbearing, overprotective mother (who wouldn't even let the father have alone time with the kid) to a nonchalant 'oh, here ya go, return him Monday' person in only a few nights after splitting up? It didn't really add up. Though, my 'girl emotions' really adored the porch scene. I guess the movie gets a big ten for music-- Zach Braff and 'Indie' never fail, no sarcasm intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is best summed up as a dramatic romantic comedy. And that is not meant to sound negative. In fact, this movie is totally realistic and the dialogue is razor sharp and should be instinctively recognizable to any of us who has actually been in love. Credit for the witty yet heart-tugging storyline goes to Paul Haggis, the genius who wrote the Oscar-winners Million Dollar Baby and Crash, as once again, his knowledge and experience of human emotions come flooding through every scene.The basic premise of the movie is a showcase of how awkward the transition can be for men, from independent, party-lover to responsible, mature adult. For some of the characters though, when you add marriage and a child to the mix, their failure to face the impending end of "freedom" is spectacularly disastrous. None more so than the lead character of Michael, who is terrified of getting married and buying a house and growing up, plus having to deal with the fact that his girlfriend is pregnant. It all seems too much to face at once, until he meets Kim, a much younger college student who awakens feelings of freedom and independence within him, even though she knows he's in a relationship. Seeing how this plays out is funny and heartbreaking at the same time.Like any good romance story, there are many other inter-connected plot lines, and they are all handled with deft skill and infinite neutrality. Trying to pick sides in this story is quite hard, which is why romance is probably not as easy as it seems. The acting is first-rate, the story is unpredictable and you'll definitely pay more attention to your own relationship afterwards. Excellent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the concept of this movie a lot when I saw the trailer in the theaters back in 2006. But when it came out, it just didn't have the traction of other movies like Garden State. Now I know why.The casting overall is great. Rachel Bilson is hot, although I never watched her in O.C., she was a stunner in Jumper. But her ability to seduce Zach Braff's character is quite a bit off. I have never seen so little attraction take place to get a guy to fall for a girl when he's already in a really good relationship, it's ridiculous.The other things that really took away from the movie was the editing and the sound dept. I feel like the movie was shorten in scenes where they should have lengthen it, and after watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, it really confirmed it. The deleted treehouse scene is so much better (although the acting wasn't, the lines seem way too fast). There's also couple of other scenes, along with the alternate ending #2, which puts things together much better. As for the sound dept, there were just some scenes where the music starts blaring, and I just felt it wasn't necessary. The music overwhelmed the scene. The most obvious is the one near the ending, but it was happening through out the movie.Overall, a decent movie, but did not quite live up to its premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your time on this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Warning:This comment contains spoilers:Warning** Am I the only one who didn't like this film? I was told this film wasn't good, but my cousins got it anyway. So I watched it and hoped for the best. Most of the comments have been saying that it was really good and interesting, but I don't agree. So many of the characters annoyed me. Rachel Bilson was quite annoying and immature and basically she acted like a dumb blonde. Also I would NEVER EVER go out with a guy if I knew he had a girlfriend. I know obviously he's about 20 times more to blame because he's the one who actually has a girlfriend, but no matter how much a guy was willing to cheat on his girlfriend with me, I wouldn't cheat. I would have respect for the girlfriend. I think Jena over reacts when she finds out he kissed Kim. I can understand why she gets so annoyed when she learns that he slept with Kim, but before that when they had just kissed, she does over react. Also that character with the baby, is so moany and annoying. Every single scene that she's in, she's moaning , moaning and moaning some more. I couldn't stand her character. If she couldn't cope with the baby, she shouldn't have had one. I presume at the end of the film they get back together. But I would have liked to see more of the final scene to see if they do get back together. I kept wanting the film top end, and that is never a good sign and then it ends abruptly when I would have liked more detail. Anyway don't bother with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this was an excellent movie, it hit way too close to home. Subjects presented in this movie are way too real. And as someone who has survived this exact hell, I did not appreciate being misled thru previews and reviews. This was the last thing I needed to see on Valentine's Day.The acting was great, as was the writing, but seeing as how my husband and I went thru this just 2 years ago and still are in the process of healing, it was terrible. I am still trying to recover from the emotional damage it brought me back to. That was the worst time in our lives and we just lived it again in that movie. It is too real so if you don't know what it is about, you should not watch it.And my husband wants to know where our check is? How a movie got made that was so about us was really really disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of Italian movie (but better)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the remake of an homonymous Italian film from 2001 titled "L'ultimo bacio" (The Last Kiss). The script, the acting and the production as a whole have however a considerably higher standard.Dialogue, which was atrocious in the Italian version, is now bearable. Situations are lively, realistic and engaging, while in the original movie they were little more than melodramatic or farcical scenes.Most characters are lifelike and plausible, while in the Italian movie they were just predictable, grotesque caricatures lacking all subtlety. In short, ironic vs. heavy-handed.In this remake actors actually act (pretty well), instead of simply yelling and screaming throughout the whole movie. The acting is successful at conveying credible feelings of love, betrayal, anger and regret. Especially love is genuine and palpable, while the original movie comes across as rather cynical and disillusioned.In fact, it is not clear whether the Italian version primarily aims at being an entertaining romantic comedy or a serious piece of social criticism. This Hollywood remake clearly opts for the former, which gives it rhythm, unity and coherence.Another merit of this new version is that it offers a more equal and modern take on marriage and steady relationships, as opposed to the Italian strictly male chauvinistic dynamics. The male lead shows a greater depth and variety of feelings that goes beyond "feeling trapped" and "trying to escape." He appears to be truly sensitive, which makes it possible for the audience to ultimately sympathize with him as well.Even the movie's Casanova is better cast as a physically attractive bartender, instead of a shady Italo-Rastafarian. The only problem is that it is quite difficult to understand why such a finely chiseled, outgoing male model would even dream of taking off aboard an old RV on a humanitarian trip to Africa: It is completely off-character. In comparison, the motives of the Italian Rasta hippie were a bit more plausible. It is just not very reasonable to create a character who is both a hippie and a Casanova.The main flaw of this remake is in fact that all secondary characters are not at all well-developed, while in the original movie they had almost the same weight as the protagonist. It is for instance difficult to understand the young father who leaves wife and child because he feels inadequate and unappreciated, or to feel for the persistent lover who has a very hard time accepting having been dumped by his high-school sweetheart. The hippie-Casanova character is reduced to a mere excuse to add a few spicy sex scenes here and there. Even the trip itself is never truly explained.The original Italian version seems to have "given up", whilst this American remake ends on a hopeful and heart-warming note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a chick flick. It's a guy flick. It's the worst of both worlds.The male audience wants him to "do it" because potential wifey is a suffocating drag. The female audience wants them back together. Neither wants to get to the heart of why women are suffocating low-self-esteemed drags, trying to land a hubby who clearly is a big 5-year old; or why the male children of babyboomers remain juvenile idiots for so damned long. Get back together? Why? How could that possibly erase what a non-entity the girlfriend is? So, you got knocked up and you begin pestering your boyfriend for a house? It's a bit late to blame him for mistakes, when you've made that doozy. Get the order straight honey. This movie is only about heaping blame on the dumb guy. Well, there's a dumb girl in the equation too!This movies Boojie values require that the world be placed back in order without question, by the time the credits roll. As in the real world, it's the guy's job to meet some high-maintenance princess where she is, and say he's wrong; no discussion.You know what? Guys don't have a nesting instinct and shame on any woman for thinking excitement over a baby is enough to engage him. Any guy who says he's excited about a baby is on his way to being his girlfriends doormat.Perhaps you liked this movie back when it was another rotten movie called "Playing for Keeps," in which the guy (John Stewart!) was also an architect.Leave your brain at the door and watch the de-riguer montages portrayed wordlessly behind a tune or two, as writers (who can't write) and viewers (who can't think) prefer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, BAD script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I love Zach Braff. I love Scrubs. I loved Garden State. I think he's a great actor and in this movie he doesn't disappoint. All the actors are great. In fact, the scene where Michael (Zach Braff) and Jenna (Jacinda Barrett) get into that first huge fight, is probably one of the best and most realistic relationship fight scenes I've ever seen on film. That being said, this script blows. Michael goes out on a date with a younger girl and kisses her. Then he realizes what he's doing is wrong and goes home. Unfortunately, his girlfriend knows about it and they get into a huge fight (the above mentioned great scene). Here's where it gets completely stupid. Michael leaves the house, goes back to the younger girl...and sleeps with her!!!!! He just saw how upset his girlfriend (who happens to be carrying his child) got when he just kissed the other girl. Why would he immediately go and sleep with her? I'm all for flawed characters. They're more interesting. But this doesn't make him flawed, it makes him a jerk. And why would anyone root for a jerk. Also, they spent too much time developing the relationship between Michael and the girl he cheats with, so there wasn't enough time for a proper reconciliation. We're supposed to care about Michael and Jenna and want them to be together. Who he cheats with is irrelevant. It should have been a spur of the moment thing so that the story could focus on repairing the damage. As it was, there wasn't enough time, so Jenna just takes Michael back after he sits on the porch for a few days. That's a terrible ending. It's basically saying it's okay to go and cheat on your girlfriend, 'cause she'll just take you back.</fullReview>

Michael(Zach Braff) is turning thirty and hitting a crossroads in life. His now pregnant girlfriend, Jenna , played very well by Jacinda Barrett, is seeking more commitment and after meeting the starkly contrasting Kim (Rachel Bilson) Michael is becoming more and more unsure about what to do. While Michael is dealing with his problems his four friends are also meeting their mid-life crisis early. One with a break-up, another with a troubled marriage and a third with commitment issues. Also starring Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson. I rank this movie 5 out of 5. See it today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My feelings toward this movie are bittersweet; sweet because everything is so realistic to the point that it makes one question whether or not the relationship one is in is actually worth being in. The movie sort of gives the impression that any problem can be solved. I saw through all of the actor's eyes and felt that any element of this movie could actually be part of my life.My boyfriend and I have sort of established that we want to be together for the rest of our lives, and he always makes it clear to me that he has integrity and that he wants to be the best he can be. I have always believed him, but after watching this movie, I realized that ANYTHING is possible; that you can't live your life thinking that you know what is going to happen because you have it all planned out. So I guess the bitter part of it all really isn't so bitter. A reality check now and then keeps us grounded...I'm just glad that I didn't watch this with my boyfriend, though, because I feel it would give him second thoughts about being in a long-term relationship. This movie is that powerful! I feel it would discourage his willingness to stay faithful and I really do not want any of those thoughts to fill our minds because we are happy where we are right now.

		<fullReview>One of the best films of 2006. It was entirely marketed wrong. I avoided it in theaters because I thought it was a film about juvenile fantasies. It's so much more than that. The relationships felt real and multi-layered. Decisions aren't easy and they aren't black and white. None of the characters are heinous, but all are flawed. In most films, one of two women would be an awful person to give the hero an easy way out. Not here. I understood all of their decisions and felt empathy when the characters went through what they were going through. In most films, supporting characters have nothing to do. Here, the characters have stories that play off the main character's story. No one is window dressing or there to give our hero sage advice. Well done. This film should have been better received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what we have come to be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an amazing, yet sad and realistic movie. I think "The Last Kiss" serves as a wake up call for all of us. A lot of people go into relationships not knowing what they're getting themselves into, and a lot of people DON'T get themselves into relationships because they're scared of what they could be getting themselves into. Both sides of the coin are bad, yet we all flip to one side or the other at some point of our lives.I think this movie really does a great job of interpreting modern relationships. We live in a word where many people are just so confused, impatient...people who gravitate toward drama because they just can't get enough, but here's the one thing I have known for awhile which has only been reinforced by this movie: there are three categories of people. There are the people who have not gotten "it" out of their system (and by it, I mean "the party animal), there are those who may never have "it" out of their system, and there are those who have never had much of "it" in their system. If you know which category you currently fall into, you can avoid the act of cheating, and I'm telling you, it's as simple as not getting too close to someone if you still haven't gotten "it" out of your system...and well if you've had "it" in your system for years, it's probably time to get "it" out and grow up, but until then don't screw someone over when you still know you have a caged animal just waiting to get out and explore.Anyway, this may sound like ranting, but it is a concept I believe this movie teaches very well. "The Last Kiss" basically works as a mirror to show us who we really are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was a chick flick for guys.In my own opinion... it just felt like the guys were all able to justify why they were being pricks but every time a girl got upset (and usually understandably so) according to the guys it was all the girls' fault.Alright - so the girl pulled a knife on poor Zachwee's character. A little much - BUT! Has anyone ever felt that betrayal before? I haven't, but I've watched a friend go through getting pregnant, the man being so happy and then cheating on her. Just watching that happen to my friend has made ME want to pull a knife on him.And in the end, he's still convinced it's all her fault HE cheated.Don't get me wrong. I love watching movies that have unlikeable characters - as long as it doesn't feel like the people who made the movie are trying to justify their ridiculous behavior.That's simply the vibe I got from the movie. That it was made by a bunch of immature women haters who think us females should bow down and follow and never ever question their authoritay!

		<fullReview>I want to start out by saying that the film has its merits. The script is amazing. The actors are all perfectly assembled and directed. The movie, if you look at it as merely a movie, was a 10 star film. Honestly.BUT...I was so angry by the end of the film that I was ready to break the stupid DVD in half. The movie is very real, and it can touch some Extremely Raw Nerves. There is one scene in particular, where the main character is bald-faced lying to his girlfriend and she knows it, and he's patronizing her about it. I wanted to rip his bleeping head off.If it weren't for the fact that, as a film, it was so well done, I would have walked out very early on. I almost wish I had, because I was upset for hours. Even after watching an extremely stupid follow up film (the very silly "Idiocracy") that had me laughing the whole way through, I was still pi$$ed off.Not for those who have had hurtful relationship issues. And most people have had hurtful relationship issues.... if nothing else, not for those who still get upset even when it's just a movie (i.e., me)...And for those of you in a happy couple, don't watch this movie and expect to get laid later on in the night. Expect to have long talks about commitment issues instead. And don't watch this movie as a first date. It's good, but I would suggest seeing it with your friends rather than your significant other, if you have to see it at all.</fullReview>

I'm sure this one was better than something like You, Me, and Dupree, but there were still two problems:1. All of the scenarios were all blown out to the Nth degree. Normally, I'm thinking there would be some introspection, guy talk, and learning to live with and embrace the progression in their life. Instead, we get a 29-year-old cheating with a college student, a second character casually deciding to leave his wife and infant, a third character staging a home invasion to tell his ex how much he loves her, and a fourth buying an RV and going who knows where.2. Your life does not end when you get married. Your life does not end when you have a kid. The male characters in this movie believe their wedding is also their funeral, which is insane. I found myself annoyed with them after about half an hour. Just because you put Zach Braff and his puppy-dog face into your movie doesn't mean I'm going to side with him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "The Last Kiss" Zach Braff plays a twenty-nine year old dissatisfied with the adulthood that awaits him as he nears thirty. His situation is compounded when his girlfriend Jacinda Barrett gives him the old "I'm pregnant" routine and he meets Rachel Bilson, a clingy college coed, at a friend's wedding. The love-triangle twist is hardly a recent story idea, however, had the film not been bogged down by subplot upon subplot of all too similar circumstances occurring to relationships with little distance from our leads, perhaps "The Last Kiss" would not have felt so emotionally forced. Little or nothing about this film is the comedy it was advertised to be, but it fails dramatically as well. There is an unnecessary emotional distance put between the audience and all of the characters. The only gripping drama tends to involve varying degrees of whining and yelling. This "St. Elmo's Fire" level of self-loathing sounds so much better in French; or like this film's source material, Italian.</fullReview>

It is the darkest movie I have ever seen, that wasn't one smile to be had the entire time and you left this movie unhappy, upset, angry and otherwise mad.

I understand some people enjoy the non-traditional movie where it doesn't work out for ANYONE and everyone is upset and you feel like crap but not me.The characters weren't even gripping, you didn't really care about any of them and you didn't even root for there happiness.So plain and simple, if you are liking for a light feel good movie, this is not it. It you are angry at love and think no one in the world is ever happy then this is your movie. When this movie ended in the full theater someone yelled out so all could here, "THAT WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVRE SEEN!"

		<fullReview>THE LAST KISS Written by Paul Haggis Directed by Tony GoldwynIf you spend any time at all at Zach Braff's myspace page, you would read how excited and proud he is of his latest starring role in THE LAST KISS. In it, he plays Michael, a 29-year-old architect who has everything he's ever wanted. He has a great position at a large firm in a field he loves; he has a strong group of friends who are always there for each other; and he has a beautiful, intelligent girlfriend who loves him deeply. He knows he's a lucky man and his friends and family see how he's about to get luckier with his girlfriend pregnant with their first child. He has them all fooled though because he sees this baby more as permanency than possibility. In many ways, this is the perfect follow-up to GARDEN STATE, in which, in addition to writing and directing, he also plays a man in his mid-twenties who does not know where his life is headed. It is only natural to find a similar character a few years later facing the issues that confront you when you finally get your ducks in line. And whereas Michael's fear of never being surprised by life again is a real anxiety, the hollow characters that make up this ensemble lend little humanity to this reality. THE LAST KISS plays out, with rare exception, as a once-fresh tale that has been spoiled by one-dimensional characters, unmotivated actions, uninspired dialogue and an expectation that its deeper than it really is.From the way Braff goes on in his blog postings, one would almost think he wrote and directed this film too. Despite not having any way to test this theory, I wonder if the film would have been better if he had. Braff's creative influence on GARDEN STATE elevated it to a higher caliber of film making because of its innovative visuals, believably broken characters and timely musings. THE LAST KISS was written by two-time Academy Award winning writer, Paul Haggis (CRASH, MILLION DOLLAR BABY). Haggis juggled an even larger ensemble in CRASH and managed to give nearly every character enough backstory to make them tangible. Here, characters are more like symbolic signifiers for Braff's Michael to go through his own transformation. One of the more notable examples is his friend, Chris (played by Casey Affleck who brings more heart to his character than any of the other younger cast members). Chris is married and has a newborn, whom his wife has grown so attached to that she no longer has interest or patience for her husband. The insinuation that this hell is what awaits anyone who gets married and has a baby is groan-inducing. Yet another obvious purpose is served in the writing of Michael's future in-laws (played by the always subtle Tom Wilkinson and always fragile Blythe Danner). They remind Michael, and us of course, that a long term marriage is difficult at best but yet somehow still worthwhile if you work real hard and learn to forgive. Despite all these poorly hidden character devices, I believe that Haggis' script is only made worse by Tony Goldwyn's direction. The problems even begin in the opening shot. Feet stroll by in close-up from each end of the frame while the credits appear amidst the limbs. A car approaches very slowly behind them and the camera tilts up to reveal Michael and his girlfriend, Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), sitting silently. The movement is awkward but the effort is noble. She asks what he is thinking about and he replies that he was wondering how he got so lucky to have her in his life. As he says this, a bus pulls up along side with a lingerie ad on its side. Michael leers and it becomes immediately obvious that THE LAST KISS will be about a man who learns to stop thinking with his penis and start feeling with his heart. Only Braff exudes too much sensitivity for him to come off as a typically uncaring guy. By the time Michael meets Kim (Rachel Bilson) at a friend's wedding (an event that naturally depresses the typical male because it feels so final), he has cemented his stance as the man who has no idea what he wants. This is perfect because Kim is the younger temptress who knows what she wants but has no idea why. They sit in a tree house and exchange thoughts on how the world moves so fast that it is only natural that people break down far earlier than in past generations. It may be a contemporary theory but it feels as borrowed from GARDEN STATE as the film's soundtrack does.Zach Braff, post-GARDEN STATE, has become something of an easily identifiable every man. He filled the shoes for a generation unsure of its path and desperately in need of meaning. And though he merely plays a role in THE LAST KISS, he has become the face of the film thanks to all his praise and enthusiasm for it. I can understand his pride in his performance but his character is flat and unimpressive. The man he once personified may have been lost but was open minded and bravely forging out a fresh, new course for himself. The man he has now become walks down a run down street in worn out shoes and blends in with the crowd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'What Is This, Some Sort Of Sappy Love Story For Women?!...I Think Not...'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, clearly, as the title and brief synopsis suggest, the first impressions of this film through text make it sound like some 'smultchzy', weepy, emotional film aimed at women and sensitive males in which people love, have problems, love again and thus; happy ending. But this simply is not the case with this film, with such pre-conceptions it becomes easy for expectations to be exceeded rather soon. Initially this film seems like nothing special, we have some rapidly established characters, yet with minimal connection to the audience. This is fine, and you'd expect this to develop throughout the film; but it seems as if this doesn't develop quickly enough. After being briefly introduced to our characters and the central plot, we are at a wedding, and it is here where 'Michael' meets 'Kim'. The immediate chemistry between Braff and Bilson seemed to be not that disparate to the chemistry displayed between Braff and Natalie Portman in the highly acclaimed film 'Garden State', this is slightly disappointing, but only to those who have seen the film in question. This chemistry, however, successfully veers off into something more unique and intriguing as the film goes on. Also, in its opening scenes, there is nothing that shouts "I am great!" There are few nice shots and it's generally aesthetically ordinary. Much of the acting is fairly quotidian with the exception of a handful of cast members, and the script promptly seems quite plain with some nice bits of dialogue here and there. Yet with all these obvious flaws outlined very early on, there is still something quite captivating about this film, and at first thought, it's hard to pin-point exactly what it is.As mentioned, there is much to be desired of the acting; all the cast performed their roles very well, but there always felt like there was something missing in their performance. In particular, Rachel Bilson ('The O.C.'), who seems somewhat unconvincing at times. Braff gives a fantastic performance however, especially in some heavy scenes nearer the end of the film where he irrevocably portrays his emotions and facial expressions. Casey Affleck is quite surprising too, having not seen him in anything before myself, I expected him to be on par with his brother Ben Affleck in terms of acting ability. Casey is convincing in his role, he doesn't quite surmount his brother, but he definitely shows some promise, (despite his peculiarly effeminate voice.)One of the films underlying themes is how we treat our dreams and aspirations, as well as how we deal with the common dilemmas of modern day civilisation. It makes a point of arguing what is worth fighting for and why, as well as displaying the options of running away. You don't necessarily learn from these points, but for certain people it's not impossible to assume that it could put some viewers' individual real-life problems into some form of perspective in terms of how they're dealing with them. This is a great aspect, be it intentional or fluke. Though despite this, some character actions and behavioural traits don't seem to make complete sense. For example, 'Kim' knows that 'Michael' is in a committed relationship, yet she tries to seduce him anyway, and personally I can't comprehend why you would try to aide and incur the self sabotage of someone's relationship for personal gain. This made 'Kim' a mystery, and gives a very ambivalent feeling towards her, being that you enjoy aspects of her character, yet at the same time dislike her actions.This goes for most characters though; there is a great deal of ambivalence and even contempt for a lot of the cast, and in the films early moments it's hard to see why. As the film goes on, or more specifically, near the end, you realise something about the characters, and the artistic intentions with the characters involved. Throughout the film the contempt and ambivalence for the characters is consistent, assumedly this would be a bad thing, but this is in fact not a mistake. The only reason this is felt is because the mind expects to have a specified emotional attachment towards each of the characters dictated to it by the film. But this is one of those surprising elements; the film does not care whether you like the characters or not, it has a complete disregard for your personal feelings on how you wish the events to turn out as well as how you desire the characters to behave. The film basically says "Here is a story for you, but I don't care if you like it or not", the reason for this, is because every single character, good performance or not, is just incredibly human. Every character has a certain level of good qualities as well as a great deal of flaws, none of the characters are perfect, and none of them claim to be. This realisation makes any discontentment towards the characters vanish.In this instance, the film fantastically avoids being predictable, as well as being some kind of 'feel good' escapist film to enjoy every once in a while on a weekend afternoon. The film convincingly tells a story of human life, and common modern social behaviour in adulthood. This overall makes for a very surprising film, and at the end you're left feeling very satisfied, and the feeling that you greatly enjoyed the movie. Even though the acting and cinematography leave much to the imagination at times, the films avoidance of escapism and its unpredictability just make this film rather unique and highly enjoyable. It may require you stick with it however, but either way, 8 out of 10 for originality!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mature storyline....!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked this movie. It made me think about myself, As i believe every man and woman who is grown up enough could easily relate to this story line. Everyone will go through this phase of his/her life. Everyone suits perfectly in their characters. i loved the acting of Jacinda Barrett. Kind of felt that she over reacted a bit in the movie but that is what movie is all about other wise it wouldn't have lasted more than 30 minutes. It circulates around Love, faith, betray..etc in a relationship but in a well organized way. Makers divided all this contents in a very systematic way amongst all friends in the movie. I liked how the movie happily ended as it should have been. This movie gives a message of faith and Love to the people and shows the importance of trust in a relationship. Well this movie has a mature storyline and every grown up teenager should go see it if they want to have a happy future. i would give it 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what did I learn from this dumb movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really disliked this movie and was mad I bothered watching the whole thing. Usually like Zach Braff, but what a dope! Found it hard to imagine a pretty young thing being so drawn to him that much. Found the subplot with Jacinda's parents pointless. Thought maybe there would be some lesson passed on to Blythe's daughter when she acted like she could never forgive Zach, but no.Found almost everything pointless, except for maybe his friends and their problems. Was almost sorry to see Jacinda give in in the end. Guess all men are juvenile dopes and all women are way, way too emotional. A shame some very good actors ever signed on for this one. My suggestion is skip this movie unless there really is absolutely nothing else to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last Kiss- Peyton Place in Wisconsin? **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...And I actually thought that the television series "Picket Fences" showed plenty of what was going on in Wisconsin.This film primarily deals with commitments or really the lack of. It is about immaturity and problems among older and younger couples. That's the problem here. Too much is trying to be shown. Nonetheless director Tony Goldwyn should be applauded here for an admirable job and getting top performances by veterans Blythe Danner and former Oscar nominee Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom). As the frustrated 30 year wife, this is Danner's best part and performance in years. She pulls out every emotional stop as a woman whose married to a psychiatrist (Wilkinson) has been failing for years. Wilkinson is a brooding figure who finally speaks out when his pregnant daughter's fiancé has cheated on her.The story is also about friends of the young couple. One disenchanted guy whose affair has ended and has decided to leave on a whirlwind trip with a fellow pal, a 29 year old bartender. Casey Affleck and his wife can't stop arguing while they undergo the pains of trying to rear a baby.The film really centers around Zach Braff and his relationship with Barrett. Who are Barrett's parents to give advice after it is revealed that their marriage is on the rocks?The film had the potential to be a good one but it tries to convey too much. Too much immaturity and lack of commitment here.The ending scenes of sitting out in the rain to get his girl back are sometimes laughable at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zack Braff and Rachel Bilson are the only reasons to enjoy this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this movie about 20 minutes into it.From there it seemed very weird.The first few moments of screen time I saw were Eric Christian Olsen having sex on screen with a woman.I was surprised to see Casey Affleck (Bobby from Drowning Mona) in this movie and I sorta enjoyed it more because of him. He's a good actor.The whole story is about failing relationships. First off Jenna's mom's marriage begins to fail. Then Chris' relationship begins to go down. Then Kenny has commitment issues and finally Michael (Zack Braff) begins to cheat on Jenna with Rachel Bilson's character Kim. As all the relationships fail you begin to wonder what the moral is.Well the moral is: no matter how bad a relationship gets, if you love each other and never give up, it can work.Zack Braff's name was on the info button when I saw this movie was coming on. He's the reason I gave this a look. As the movie went on I saw Rachel Bilson in this film so it made me more interested.The acting however was overboard by the Jenna character. The writing was a little illogical and the plot was very odd. However after about 1 hour you begin to grow on the characters, acting and the story interests you so you can find out what will happen at the end.The ending itself is nothing. Literally, nothing happens. I wouldn't recommend this film, simply because its not very entertaining. If you happen to catch it sometime you might enjoy it. If you don't catch it, don't worry, you can still see Zack Braff on repeats of Scrubs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do kiss and tell others the brilliance of "The Last Kiss"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me give you lip on the romantic comedy "The Last Kiss", it is one of the entertaining film delights of the year. Why, you ask? For the many following reasons! Do not panic! I promise I will give it the K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple Stupid) writing method because most of my film reviews are written that way anyway. Zach Braff stars as Michael; a late 20's Wisconsiner who lives a utopia life; financial success as an architect, a beautiful girlfriend who is pregnant with his progeny, and supportive childhood friends whom are a close-knit group. Yes, most guys want to "Be Like Mike". However, Michael experiences the unavoidable Commitmentphobiasm that most male species catch when they know it is time they should ask the "I Do" pregunta to their significant other. In other words, he probably wants to experience the last bliss before he pops le question, if he ever does, to his gal Jenna (Jacinda Barrett). That is when the alluring youthful Kim (Rachel Bilson) comes in the picture. Michael meets Kim at one his best friend's wedding and eventually she becomes Michael's "kimotherapy" or one can say "The Last Temptation of Mike". The beauty of "The Last Kiss" is that is also salivated with other juicy story lines involving Michael's peeps. Chris, played by Casey Affleck, is residing in "Psycho Wife" Hotel by having a nagging wife who criticizes the weak Christian for not being a good father. Izzy, played by Michael Weston, iz residing in Elvis' infamous "Heartbreak Hotel" by obsessing on trying to get back his high school sweetheart. Kenny, played by Eric Christian Olsen, is residing in a version of Hugh Hefner's infamous "Playboy Mansion" Hotel by having sexual intercourse with beautiful girls in his slacker-type apartment (obviously, this takes the cake as the juiciest storyline and is Kenny not Michael who really resides in Utopiaville!). There is also an affectionate storyline involving Jenna's parents Stephen &amp; Anna played by the wonderful Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner. Paul Haggis, yes the "Crash" Paul Haggis, scripted out the accurate dialogue tongue action for "The Last Kiss". Director Tony Goldwyn also struck gold with the inventiveness and humanism that he puckered up to "The Last Kiss". I must also "kiss and tell" and state that the cast of "The Last Kiss" ranks up there as one the best ensemble acting groups of the year on film. Zach Braff is following Dustin Hoffman's footsteps in acting grandeur. Jacinda Barrett was a sweet surprise. Rachel Bilson, in her first movie role, proved that she is a must see besides the O.C. Affleck, Weston, and Olsen were a super support acting trio. Danner and Wilkinson were parentally perfect! To quote le great Prince, all you gotta do is find some extra time and go see "The Last Kisssssss". ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average film, messy plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is distinctly average. While a number of the cast turn in good performances, the plot is too messy and loses its way. Zach Braff gives a one-dimensional performance as Michael, a confused 30 year old on the brink on being a father and shows once again he should stick to what he is good at - comedy. The films redeeming qualities come from heartfelt performances from the majority of the rest of the cast, in particular Jacinda Barret, Casey Affleck and Blythe Danner. At the outset it appears that we are going to be shown multiple stories unwinding, but this soon gives way to the clichéd and frankly quite boring single focus of Braff, his girlfriend and a uni student (Bilson). Afflecks storyline is interesting, but it is given so little screen time that it is left feeling underdeveloped. Braffs other completely one-dimensional friends (played by Michael Weston and Eric Christian Olsen) are involved in an unnecessary and pointless subplot that feels completely out of place in the film. This film seems to have started a host of stories and after two hours of nothing really progressing I was left feeling frustrated and bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course it is because I am getting old. I don't give a d***, The last kiss is soooo booooring and predictable. I already knew what would happen within 5 minutes. Young couple gets married, life is no rosegarden, they threaten to split, end good all good. In between there is talking, talking and more talking. There are the wise, sensible parents (still not looking old of course) of the young couple, trying to help whenever possible. If The last kiss represents the average problem of the new generation, I am glad I am of the old one. But I don't believe it - I refuse to believe it. Anyhow, there is a lesson to be learnt. According Haggis and Goldwyn a married man can get away with adultery, if he is willing and prepared to spend two or three nights on the doorstep of the own house, where is wife still remains. Still this is only true for the new generation. I asked my girlfriend (not 25 anymore) and she replied: no way. Nah, when it is about relation problems, go see Kramer vs Kramer or read something of Homerus - the homecoming of Odysseus or the story of Agamemnon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing take on life and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not impressed by this movie. Although the acting was passable, I was surprised to find the dialog by usually strong screenwriter Paul Haggis highly unrealistic. The characters had no subtleties to them, the female characters were especially unbelievable in this movie. This film had the potential to be an introspective look at the way relationships really work, instead it was a typical cliché of the late twenties guy not wanting to grow up, and the more mature woman accepting that she'll never find a truly responsible man. The story about the parents was added to show that things can flip the other way as well, but these characters weren't explored enough to have any real in depth understanding of their relationship. Even the publicists saw that this movie missed the mark as an introspective drama which is why they were forced to pitch it as a romantic triangle film which it clearly wasn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bit better than OK.I kept finding myself growing annoyed with the excessive and hysterical reactions of many of the female characters, but I do prefer movies like this one, which attempts to imitate real life, to actually imitate real life. So love is crazy, but this film depicts women as highly irrational and super-sensitive beings, a phenomenon that was so excessive I began to abhor the female characters and, consequently, sympathize deeply with the males. This response in myself makes me agitated at the movie's unfair portrait of women; yes, women are emotional and sensitive, and they can be a bit mad when their hormones cause them to be, but this film so exaggerates the complex nature of woman that it inevitably leaves a false and negative impression on viewers.Other than this one fault, the movie is quite hilarious and insightful. I would definitely recommend seeing it, but one time is enough--at least for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fetal alcohol syndrome, cynical, and depressing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What the heck? In the opening scenes, one of the main characters announces she's pregnant, and then proceeds to drink champagne. Haven't the producers of this movie ever heard of fetal alcohol syndrome?Generally the film is set up to have the feel of a typical romantic comedy, but it's rather light on the comedy (it's kind of serious throughout), and is actually pretty depressing.At one point early on a character reflects that his life feels planned out, and there are no more surprises. That's kind of what this movie is like. Actually, I might characterize this movie as a very effective advertisement for remaining MarriageFree and ChildFree.A good tagline on a poster for this movie would be: "Are you a romantic? Then ABANDON ALL HOPE." Seriously, this movie plays on all our fears about infidelity, children ruining relationships, marriages falling apart... if you've pragmatically decided against getting married and having children, then this movie will reinforce your decisions.The acting overall is decent, and the movie does evoke emotion, it's just that none of that emotion is positive. Rather than being a "Romantic Comedy", this movie belongs in the category of "Romantic Horror". Maybe some people appreciate movies that make you feel cynical and depressed, but I generally try to choose entertainment that's uplifting and, well, entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disjointed and Pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just rented The Last Kiss (actually, my wife did). The problem is that the movie never decides to tell me what it is about - is it about a life crisis? It is about commitment, or lack of? Is it about last flings? In none of those possibilities does the film dwell enough to make me care. The main character's friends are of little help plot wise - they either do not give him advise, or support, or tips, or a kick in the arse... anything that may give them relevance. Looking at their antics was like seeing totally different movies. It was rather a waste of time even taking time to know these characters. I was kept wondering just what did the young girl that created the schism between the main character and his girlfriend ever saw on this guy - I may not be a girl, but even I can spot a geek when I see one. It was not like he had the best conversation on the planet, if good looks were not the issue, so what was it? I told my wife that maybe the girl lost a bet, or that she was dared by her girlfriends.I was drawn because of the generally good reviews for this film, but I must confess that I think those reviewers gave such reviews because they felt some comfort for their own idiotic decisions - like not taking responsibility for anything, having no interest in making a commitment, and other post-modernistic nightmares. I did not find one, not one single idea, situation or decision that redeemed any of the characters, making the movie an exercise in aggravation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just spent the last hour and half trying not to turn off my DVD. If it wasn't for Jacinda Barrett I would have. She is the only true bright spot to this surprisingly down movie. After enjoying Garden State so much, I eagerly awaited watching this movie. Even though they were made by different people,it was billed as something similar. Wrong!!! Zach Braff's character Michael is a total jerk start to finish. It was bad enough to date another woman, but then after getting caught, going back for more. When Jenna was threatening him with the knife, I was hoping she would stab him!! The rest of the cast was okay. But the characters were all totally unlikable, with maybe the exception of Kenny the bartender. He at least knew what he liked. Other than that, the rest were all over the map. Jenna was the only good person and yet she failed when she opens the door. I know it is only a movie, but she could do better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misguided in many aspects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general, I'm not a big fan of holding one movie up to another when reviewing it. But sometimes the nature of two films virtually demands those comparisons. Such was the case in part for "World Trade Center", and such is the case for "The Last Kiss"...Comparisons between "The Last Kiss" and "Garden State" are unavoidable, largely because Zach Braff stars in both movies, but also because both are wandering missives on particular stages of life. None of the characters are the same, but this movie is still a pseudo-sequel to "Garden State". While Braff did not direct or write "Kiss" as he did "State", his influence on many parts of the movie is undeniable, from quirky mannerisms to the laid-back soundtrack that he produced. His presence also lends more credence to the movie, because if he did not tote residual quality from "State", "Kiss" would feel like a cheap knock-off of his previous picture. Instead, it just feels cheap."Garden State" addressed that gray time in one's early twenties between school and adulthood, while "Last Kiss" focuses on the late twenties jump from young professional to marriage. Michael (Braff) and his girlfriend Jenna (Jacinda Barrett) have just learned they are pregnant. That news rolled together with the variables contributed by their semi-dysfunctional circle of friends and family leaves Michael a little uneasy about his planned future, an issue complicated by the sudden arrival of the sexy, care-free co-ed Kim (Rachel Bilson) into his life. Unfortunately though the veneers of "State" and "Kiss" are similar, they differ widely beneath the surface, and "Kiss" takes the worst of every comparison despite good work from a similarly solid cast."Garden State" seemed to genuinely explore a confusing time in life, while "Last Kiss" seems to have a message: that marriage as something to be dreaded rather than eagerly anticipated. Beyond just providing numerous negative examples, the movie treats such miserable relationships as normal and unavoidable, which is where the movie truly falls short. Much of the skepticism raised is legitimate when approached as means rather than ends. But rather than use those doubts as impetus to burrow into the coal mines of relationships with hopes of finding a diamond, "Kiss" turns off the lights and dams up the entrance, leaving everything dark and frightening with scarcely a ray of hope. It's enough to discourage anyone from getting hitched or even seriously involved with someone else. And that's bothersome. The negative aspects of marriage are emphasized, and the positives are largely ignored. The portrayal isn't aggressively negative, but seems to rise from a basic misunderstanding, probably from experience, of how marriage can and should work. It's impossible to get past this pessimistic view of an establishment that is in actuality so wonderful.(end soapbox)Beyond the moral issues of "Kiss", which I suppose are debatable, the movie lacks rationale, even by cinematic standards. Everything on screen doesn't have to be fully logical or sensible, but when characters possess only two disparate dimensions, normal and insane, they end up depressing and wearing out the audience, like the clueless mother in the supermarket who hasn't a chance of calming her screaming child. That inadequacy overshadows any positive elements "Kiss" might have presented."Garden State" had fantastic highs in its small moments. "Last Kiss" tries to match that potency in a few situations, but ends up looking like one of its characters, a college kid trying to fit into an adult life. At times the movie's sentiments are okay, but more often than not the accurate observations are drowned out by all the yelling. What's missing is a reasonable understanding of the big picture, which might have elevated the movie to watchable status. As is, "Kiss" is just not strong enough to reach nearly the same heights.Bottom Line: The only redeeming values here are the mellow soundtrack (artists like Imogen Heap and Coldplay), which is essentially Braff's latest mix tape, and how the movie can spur thoughts about relationships. But there are better ways to experience both. Obviously not recommended. 4 of 10.(And for the record, I gave "Garden State" a 7. Great moments, but an inconsistent film.)</fullReview>

You can understand and deeply empathize with all sides of this story - from Braff's frustration and eventual indiscretion to Affleck's knife-wielding anger - even if you don't agree with them. A real wake-up call for a generation that feels it knows everything and has it all under control. Laugh-out-loud moments sit comfortably alongside bitter-sweet tears - the relationship between the parents was very moving and beautifully contrasted with the shenanigans of the younger couple. Not as quirky as Garden State but a lot closer to the bone in terms of depicting real people in sometimes all too real situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Script with some shots at Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Paul Haggis has come a long way since his writings for "Walker, Texas Ranger". With "Crash" and "Million Dollar Baby" behind his name, he has earned respect and his films will always get a shot from real film-goers. Probably a lucky thing form me, because otherwise I would have had no interest in seeing this apparent chick flick.I say lucky because this is an excellent and complex script in regards to all relationships. Yes, it takes more than a few shots at us guys and our obvious inability to read the minds of any female - even if married for 30 years! Still the realistic situations and emotions are well captured in numerous scenes.There is a touch of "Diner" with the whole male-bonding thing and a very obvious tip of the cap to "Say Anything" with Zach Braff's porch scenario, but we never really have the feeling that we have seen all of this before. Most of the credit must go to Haggis, but the acting is fine throughout. Braff is believable in the lead and Jacinda Barrett is at times very powerful in her joy and pain. There a couple of scenes with Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson that will make every married couple cringe with recognition. Last, but certainly not least, welcome to the big screen Rachel Bilson (from "The OC", who looks like she could be Rachel McAdams little sister).Director Tony Goldwyn is known mostly as a supporting actor and TV director, but does a fine job of maintaining the pace of the Haggis script and not relying too much on facial close-ups which would have minimized some of the effective body language of the actors. Overall, a decent film without too much fluff or stereotyping - despite the obvious bias towards the woman's viewpoint. Downside is definitely a weak soundtrack that does nothing for the film.</fullReview>

There were hardly any likable characters, and just as soon as you think you like someone, they turn around and do something so awful that you hate them. The only character I could possibly relate to was Jacinda Barrett's Jenna, the pregnant girlfriend of Zach Braff's Michael. Even this likable character, however, was spoiled by Barrett's mediocre performance where her natural Australian accent peeked through one time too many. I went into this movie expecting something more along the lines of Garden State, and I was devastatingly disappointed. Moreso than wanting my money back, I want therapy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Haggis and Zach Braff, two men who in recent years have combined to bring us superb cinematic achievements, in Crash and Garden State respectively, epitomize the the sum equaling far less than the whole of the parts. Haggis' adaptation of the original Italian film pales in comparison to Crash. Crash examined real social issues, made the viewer think, and compelled you to like, and hate each character any any given moment of the film. In Garden State, Braff created characters who had depth, and managed to brilliantly portray one of those characters. However, in the Last Kiss, each man failed to give a repeat performance. With the exception of Tom Wilkenson, who gave a great performance, the characters lacked depth, or anything that resembled real emotion. In turn, Braff's character, Micheal, while facing certain issues in his life, portrays the emotions that he is experiencing poorly, failing to make them transcendent to the audience. In all, I would say this is not a horrible movie, but rather a run of the mill film from two leading men who have proved previously that they are capable of much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trying too hard to do too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm conflicted about this film. You see, I see a lot of good stuff in this film, but I see a lot of bad stuff in this film. The acting ranges from mediocre (many of the younger types) to solid (the elderly types). The direction is less than satisfactory. The writing has really solid ideas, but sometimes the execution seems forced and the characters a little too simple--too plot driven and losing out on the story and characters. And yet there's still some meaningful themes and honest-to-goodness reality thrown in the mix to help us examine the stupid decisions we make and the clear disillusionment that people in the age group faces.Decisions regarding relationships and self-discovery. Seeing the quarter-life meltdown in full effect and having to react to it ourselves or consider it ourselves. In some senses, I really like this film for its willingness to make the audience confront real issues that we face. It's just that the execution of these ideas isn't tight.In the film, the characters make decisions about their lives that don't seem entirely natural (hence forced), in order to make the writer's points. Decisions about marriage, divorce, staying together and staying apart. Furthermore, some secondary character plot lines receive lip service, despite the significance of their events and I wonder why the characters weren't further minimized so I didn't get distracted by the essentially insignificant plots.I want to like this film more than I do, but it's not awful either. It's just trying too hard to do too much and is lacking the capacity to pull off everything that it wants to. Nevertheless, I like the primary statement that it has to make about love. It's okay. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good Relationship Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This solidly written and acted relationship dramedy surprised me with its adult approach to material that has been done to death elsewhere.Zach Braff attempts to shed the goofball charm that makes him such an appealing heartthrob to college-age girls who know him primarily for his work on the television show "Scrubs," and knuckles down to play a man on the cusp of thirty who feels panic-stricken by all the life responsibilities that turning thirty implies. Things aren't helped by the fact that his girlfriend, who he's reluctant to marry, is pregnant. A stupid decision on his part threatens their relationship, and the happy Hollywood ending at least comes with enough uncertainty and bitterness to make it believable.This movie hasn't yet seemed to have found an audience, and I'm not surprised. Braff is at a funny place in his career. The twenty-somethings who like him because of "Scrubs" aren't mature enough to understand this movie -- a group of college girls behind me in the theatre did nothing but giggle through the whole thing and seemed disgruntled at the end that the whole movie was, in their words, "depressing." But Braff isn't yet old enough to make older audiences believe he has anything to tell them about life experience. This movie is pretty much squarely aimed at people my age -- that is, people just barely on either side of 30 -- despite the presence in the film of Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson, playing a married couple going through a crisis of their own.This film says a lot of honest things about relationships: how both men and women are scared about committing to one another and how each gender reacts to that fear; how we look to the examples in our lives for clues on how to deal with our own messes; how 30-year-olds think they know it all because they know more than they did when they were 20, yet know barely anything compared to those who are 50 and older. It's even a rather complicated film in that no one character is entirely likable or entirely unlikable. Virtually everyone in it makes some mistake at one point or another, but as the film makes crystal clear, to point a finger at someone else's mistakes means pointing a finger at your own.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie itself is very honest. I like Garden State and the thing it has in common with it is that their both very truthful. But i like this movie more. Probably cause I can relate to it. The movie shows that their's not always happy endings. That their are problems in life and that people make mistakes. This movie will capture your attention and makes you think about love and your life. The stories with all the people in the movie happens in real life. But i found myself not liking the Kim character cause it makes you realize their will always be girl's like that their. Each character has something different that they have to deal with, that they have to go through. I liked the movie cause it was very different compared to a lot of other movies i've seen. you should definitely go see it and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie because I can relate to it. Guys who are on their late twenties and early thirties facing life as it is. I had initial doubts on watching this film because the trailer was for me boring. But I was in a for a big surprise. This movie is above par the typical romantic comedies Hollywood makes. It makes you think. I believe that there is a personality of every character in the film in each one of us. From our age group aka the early thirties to even to those in their sixties. The entire cast was excellent - Zach Braff, Jacinda Barrett, the OC's Rachel Bilson, Casey Affleck, Tom Wilkinson, Blythe Danner and many more. A treasure of a movie, it should be discovered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie- Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I really enjoyed Braff's character in the Last Kiss as it was very relivable and reminiscent of what every individual goes through at one point during their life. The confusion and the indecisiveness was very heartfelt and real. The acting was great and one could really feel the pain and heartache each character went through individually. The storyline was real and believable. The music was great as well. I would for sure recommend everyone to see it. To some it may be cheesy and emotional but to those who ever have gone through a break up, have ever been faced with an obstacle, for those who need a mistake or a wake up call to realize what is important and whats not, for those who have been blind to the wonderful things in front of them and have realized the great loss when it is too late but still have faith and hope and who ever felt lost and confused about life and their role in it, it is absolutely fantastic.</fullReview>

It defines relationship truths... another rarity in movies. Excellent acting. Fabulous story. One I may see again. I experienced several emotions... laughing, heartbreak, etc. I don't know why it is compared to Garden State (another good one) as the only similarity is the leading actor... This movie has lots of quotable quotes too. One of my favorites comes from how they got the title. The cast is believable. Worth every penny to see it in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strong Dramatic Depiction of Relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Kiss exudes with powerful and provocative performances in revealing several relational scenarios. The power of love and sex is depicted in sometimes harsh, sometimes emotional ways that hit the audience with the striking energy that love and its resulting pain have done so many times to so many people. While the resolution at the movie's end is somewhat of a softlanding, perhaps it's time to have some suggestive hope for this emotion called "love." Overall, the essence of the relationships and the development of three or four of the couples focused on are a grown up men's version of last year's girl-movie entitled "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" (2005). This movie unfortunately doesn't fall onto the energy level such as "Crash" (2005), deflated somewhat by its ambivalence as a comedy drama that actually is more of a romantic drama than comedy drama. If this movie had had a more serious and realistic cinematographic approach like Crash, the movie could have had Oscar potential. Eight out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a seventeen year old female and I saw this yesterday with my boyfriend of over a year. Throughout the whole movie we exchanged very awkward and unsure glances. It was sort of uncomfortable. This movie started out right away and jumped right into the story. I was surprised by the amount of sex scenes: NOT a good movie to see with your parents. The movie had very realistic conversations and a wonderful soundtrack. But, there was a lot of fights in several relationships, and made it seem like all relationships are doomed to end with someone cheating, a divorce, separation, etc. It was depressing to see a movie that pretty much says that relationships suck. I did like the movie after it was over and the tension between my boyfriend and I was replaced by feelings of hope and love. Overall, it was a good movie that I would even like to see again, but DON'T go see it on a first date or with parents. Go see it with someone that you really love and feel comfortable with or with your girlfriends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely done contemporary, fresh drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that going into this movie I had fairly high expectations. I am a relatively big fan of Garden State, Braff's last film project, as well as a fan of many of the actors (Wilkinson, Affleck) and thought that the piece really had some potential. Luckily, this is one instance where my expectations were met and I'd even go as far as to say slightly exceeded.While it's fair to say that the portrayal of Michael's (Braff) struggle to cope with adulthood is a slightly unrealistic one due to his seemingly perfect life, I still think the film touched on some universal issues that aren't too far-fetched at all. Even with a seemingly perfect life its easy to wonder if you are content enough to be happy with things for the rest of your life. The film had some intense scenes which really made the characters and the relationships a lot more believable than lots of typical Hollywood love stories with their flowery endings and over the top romanticism.Most of the minor characters added to the film as a whole, and I thought Kim (Bilson) was pretty good in her first real movie gig, even if her role wasn't exactly a major stretch for her.I'd recommend this film to anyone who appreciates heartfelt drama that doesn't leave you with a so-sweet-its-sour feeling at the end, but rather challenges you to think about things in a more mature light. It certainly had its flaws at points, but it can serve as the starting point for this generation's drama/comedy for sure.</fullReview>

The only thing that they changed was the ending (which I enjoyed, but disappointed me because the Italian mystery was gone)! I do agree in that some of the characters didn't seem to have the same importance as in the original.. and Kim's character was just bad! i don't know if it was the acting or the writing, but the character was too childish, which doesn't correlate with the fact that in this film she is older. Overall, I have decided to think of it as two different movies, that are very a lot. L'Ultimo Bacio will always rule my heart, however The Last Kiss is up there especially because it's wonderful soundtrack!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well observed drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only watched this film because it takes place in Madison, WI, where I lived for a couple of years a while back. I was surprised to find a pretty good film. Zach Braff plays a man nearing 30 whose girlfriend is newly pregnant. Feeling trapped, he is easily seduced by a 20 year-old girl who throws herself at him. Meanwhile, his three best friends face the crises that come with that age. I thought the characters and situations were very well observed, and the acting was quite good. Casey Affleck in particular is great as the married friend with a 1 year-old who's starting to think that it might be for the best if he and his wife split up. My only real problem is with Braff's girlfriend's parents, played by Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson, who are having marital problems themselves. That subplot is poorly developed and poorly integrated into the rest of the film, and Danner overperforms her role terribly. Is it just me, or does she seem pickled drunk in every movie she's in? Must be me. The movie is a remake of a 2001 Italian drama of the same name, which I haven't seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging, but emotionally sterile at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What seemed like the next predictable step along neurotic romantic Zach Braff's limited though appealing budding film career landed him in the adulterous drama, posing that big question males face when settling down with the one they believe is true love. Ripped from the Italian original of five years ago, The Last Kiss tries to ask this question with dignity and grace, although the melodramatic tone may come across a little more staged then ought be. Despite Braff's always naturalistic tendencies, his near one-dimensionality is further compromised given the bland surroundings his apparently torturous affair fills this character conflict with. Any chemistry Braff and his college squeeze manage to elicit between each other completely falls by the wayside due to Rachel Bilson's inability to harness even the smallest amount of charisma, thereby rendering much of the film's buildup rote. Thankfully the seasoned subtleties of struggling couple played by Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson help amend the excessive pouting from the primarily young cast, though a few of Braff's old buddies play their stereotypical roles rather well. Gifted scribe Paul Haggis certainly holds things together enough, though a certain amount of oversimplification may have more questioning viewers reaching for the Italian version, I know that was my initial reaction after I had viewed the lukewarm emotional integrity throughout this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it may be a Tony Goldwyn directed movie, but for better or worse, it's Paul Haggis's Crash all over again, up to a point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Kiss should not really be called a romantic comedy as it isn't really all that funny. Little bits attempt for it, but they end up falling quite flat (the bit that's been seen in commercials and trailers, where Zack Braff's character Michael hits a tree in the midst of being in hot water with his fiancé). So it's really more of a romantic drama/relationship movie about various couples intertwined together through family or friends who deal with the problems of infidelity, trust, "growing-up" issues, and just being stunted in the period right before life "begins" for the next generation. And who better to take this on than Paul Haggis? Well, not really. It's almost strange that a film like the Last Kiss ends up being watchable at times and even well acted, but is also over-wrought and over-bearing at times with its dramatic points. Like Crash, Paul Haggis's film that catapulted him to great acclaim with fans and critics, The Last Kiss never focuses long enough on one relationship (until maybe the last half hour when it does settle in on Michael and Jacinda Barrett's Jenna), and like Crash, at least from my perspective, only allows for little bits of really truthful moments and genuine pathos to come through.And it ends up working in its bits because the actors, with maybe a couple of exceptions, almost know how to do this material better than the writer does himself. I wonder now how this holds up against the original 2001 Italian film of the same name, if perhaps the filmmakers behind that caught onto the dramatic wrenches thrown into affairs and loves of people on the edges of well-off lives. But at any rate, the Last Kiss isn't necessarily a bad movie. In fact, there are some scenes, like one between Jenna and her mother played by Blythe Danner where she lays it out simply for her daughter why she split from her father. Some scenes like that, like with Casey Affleck's storyline of being unable to cope with living with someone and raising a kid, have little moments that do click together through direction, script and acting. But these moments don't add up to something that really comes through well. And one character, Kim, played by Rachel Blisson in a very one-note way, casts a very un-realistic glow at times with her dialog (that scene with Braff and Blisson on the porch during the wedding, ugh).All of the relationships in the film are fractured and may or may not be repaired, but aside from the main storyline its hard to invest that much emotional interest in one before its jerked off into another. Michael Weston, for example, is a talented character actor who has a part here that could have more depth, but doesn't. And in the end, Haggis puts up major dramatic highpoints and sappy bits all in the last half hour, until it becomes a mish mash of honest moments where the actors do get it, where there's just too much going on in the scene to really be played right, and where just little things end up becoming irritable. One of those, overall, is the soundtrack. In small doses I could listen to some of these songs, but all put together to the images and scenes it just adds to the awkwardness and loses the edge of the drama (Coldplay for example). In the end, the Last Kiss leaves a favorable impression only for scenes and parts of performances, like Tom Wilkinson who's impervious to flawed screenplays, and may leave Braff fans divided. This isn't Garden State 2, this much is true. In fact, I'd say Garden State was better and through its own quirkiness more fulfilling on an entertainment level. Oscars or not, Haggis, for me, threatens to sink this big 20-something love story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE LAST KISS (2006) **1/2 Zach Braff, Jacinda Barrett, Casey Affleck, Rachel Bilson, Michael Weston, Blythe Danner, Tom Wilkinson, Eric Christian Olsen, Harold Ramis. "Diner" meets "Kicking &amp; Screaming" by way of "The Graduate" could have been the pitch for this middling dramedy about a group of four twentysomething buddies facing the Big Choices in Life including Braff's dalliance with a hottie young college co-ed (Bilson) despite having a pregnant girlfriend (Barrett) in the mix; Affleck facing a marriage that is not working; lovesick Weston making a knee-jerk reaction to take a long-distance road trip; and perpetually horny Olson looking for the next quick lay. Immature? Sure. Grow up. Most definitely. However the ensemble makes the most of their underscored atypical roles thanks to a list-less script by Paul Haggis (loosely based on an Italian film, "L'ultimo bacio") and sturdy direction by actor Tony Goldwyn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT-- I will never, ever like Zach Braff. I might always hate him. Let me sum this movie up for you. Men are cast as children. Women are cast as overemotional psychos (esp the redhead with the baby and- I suspect- the menopausal mother). In this alternate reality, men screw up, women go wild either sexually (the sex kitten the long-haired dude met at the wedding) or emotionally, and losers with big lips are forgiven in the end. God. This was worse than Garden State, just not as painful. Throw in the indie cred music, and my hatred for this movie in this post rivals the almost incoherently scathing review I wrote for Garden State in college.

Well, I don't know one Is about finding himself when he returns to his hometown for his mother's death, reunites with friends, he has Revelations, and finds love- in his early 20's. The last kiss I thought had more depth to it- while going through the almost "30" crisis. It was brutally honest, which I know some people don't like/can't deal with. Just because you're married, have a kid, and are happy, doesn't mean there aren't people out there who connected and understood what these characters were going through and feeling. It was realistic, but managed to still make you laugh even though you know you shouldn't be. I hated Kim's character, not because of her just the realness, and probability that there will always be that girl that makes men question everything... It's a remake apparently, but I still think it's original compared to all the other crappy predictable movies out right now. Some people don't like the end, how you don't know what happens to him and his girlfriend, what the 2 guys end up doing/going in the RV road-trip, what the married/separated guy does with the kid/ex situation, but you know what not to sound cheesy but that was the perfect ending because in life you don't know whats next, and it leaves your mind to actually think and imagine what the ending was... what you would imagine the ending to be. It's great. It makes you cry, laugh, and question everything in your life, your parents, friends, significant others (weither that be good or bad) It's honest, and you connect with everyone, and even if you don't- you want to understand them and get in their head and know what their really thinking...</fullReview>

The women in the film have their feet firmly planted on the ground (except the slutty home wrecker but she can be forgiven because she is 10 years younger and obviously stupid and therefore has a reason to be immature). These wonderful, long suffering women have their hands full with these jerks and you start to hate these women because they must be just as dumb to want to even be in relationships with such stupid men. So, you suffer through this whole film watching this guy cheat on his pregnant girlfriend whom he "loves" so much. And instead of realizing the error of his ways and growing up and finally asking her to marry him which is what she really wants, he lies by her door for 3 days and this is supposed to show her how much he loves her. She finally comes to the door and lets him in and that's the end! I mean how stupid is that? So he doesn't end up learning anything. He's still the dumb jerk he started out as and so is she for that matter. A truly ridiculous and pointless movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Last Kiss" is a poor remake filled with unlikable, one dimensional characters as well as an extremely sappy and predictable script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last Kiss" is a remake of a 2001 Italian film entitled "Ultimo bacio, L" aka "The Last Kiss." This film is about a man named Michael (Zach Braff) who seems to be in a great relationship with the woman of his dreams, Jenna (Jacinda Barrett). But when Jenna announces that she is pregnant with his child, Michael begins to think that his life from this point on will be very predictable. It isn't long before Michael makes the idiotic decision to get involved with a younger woman named Kim (Rachel Bilson). A dull soap-opera type film ensues?Yawn?is really the best way to describe my feelings on "The Last Kiss." When I first saw the trailer for the film, I immediately wanted to see the film because not only did it look great but it had a great cast as well. Unfortunately, the interesting marketing campaign which makes this film seem like it will be "Garden State 2" isn't true at all. So let me begin why I was disappointed with this film. First off, it's a remake of an Italian film which is far superior. A remake can be good because it has happened before but "The Last Kiss" isn't. Next, the characters in this film are all very unlikable, one dimensional, selfish, and overall extremely stereotypical. When all was said and done I didn't care about any of the characters and I didn't care what happened to them. Thirdly, the film was so extremely predictable to the point where the members in the screening actually began laughing at the fact of how predictable it was. There were so many predictable scenes that it was almost like they were taken from previous movies. But what made it even funnier was the fact that so many people in the audience were just calling out every scene. Lastly, the movie felt overly long and boring even though it only ran an hour and 45 minutes. Many scenes felt overly long and dragged out, and there were a number of other scenes I could have done without like some of the sex scenes which seemed more like time fillers than anything else. Also the best friend played by Eric Christian Olsen was a completely pointless and meaningless character.Moving on to the acting, I don't know if I should blame the actors, the script or director on this one. But I will say this; I think Rachel Bilson is a mediocre actress who really should remain on television in TV shows like The O.C. because her on-screen presence isn't good. Also I have to ask how does Eric Christian Olsen keep getting roles? He is such a horrible actor who plays the same character in every movie! Also I am beginning to think that if this film becomes a big hit, Zach Braff will continue to play the same depressed and confused character over and over again. It's a shame because I think he has a potential to be great actor but he seems to be type-casted or maybe he just always looks depressed for no reason. Also I don't know why but almost every scene with Blythe Danner was laughably bad, which I don't get because she definitely is a good actress so I can only guess the material she had just wasn't good for her. Lastly, Tom Wilkinson's character was almost a complete waste of a character and to have him in this film and not use him to his full potential is definitely a major let down. Like I said most of the cast is talented but they are just poorly used. Besides the talented actors and actresses who were wasted in this film, what made me even more disappointed with the film was the fact that this movie was written by Paul Haggis. Haggis is the man who wrote academy award winning films like "Crash" and "Million Dollar Baby" but I guess he couldn't go 3 for 3. Thinking back on "Crash" he just put together a bunch of stereotypical racist characters. He did the same thing with this film without the characters being racist. The problem is unlike in "Crash" none of the characters had any redeeming qualities and the story wasn't anywhere as interesting. Its amazing how poorly written and predictable this film was because as I previously stated there were so many scenes that the audience just started screaming out what was going to happen next which made it funny when it wasn't suppose to be.In conclusion, "The Last Kiss" was a huge disappointment in my eyes. I was expecting a great movie since the trailers made the film look outstanding. Also the cast and writer Paul Haggis had me believing that this movie would in fact be one of my favorite films of the year. But instead I have to agree with Edward Douglas from Comingsoon.net who said "Bring a barf bag and a razor blade, because you'll need one or both by the time you're done with this." I would have to agree because I couldn't wait for this film to end. It was so dull and the characters were so lame and unlikable that after 30 minutes of this film, I hoped they all died in a car accident so the film would end. It was definitely a disappointment and if anyone feels the urge to see this, I highly recommend that you wait till DVD because many will be disappointed with the fact that they spent their hard earned money on this average film that seemed like a soap opera or a made for television movie that would be shown on the lifetime network. MovieManMenzel's final rating for "The Last Kiss" is a 4/10, a disappointing remake that is filled with unlikable characters and a dull and predictable story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Kiss is a must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Kiss is a film of complex relationships. It's about 5 relationships though the main focus is that of Michael (Zach Braff,)a confused man not knowing what he wants out of life and his pregnant girlfriend Jenna (Jacinda Barrett,) a woman who believes that her relationship is perfect.All five relationships are tested to see how strong they are. Some will survive, some will fall, some won't even get off the ground.Though not original, this film succeeds because of the great writing an fine performances. It was written by Paul Haggis (Million Dollar Baby.) The plot is rich in story and rich in characters. The dialogue never tries to be over dramatic. It's not a typical "chick flick" as the film deals with a lot of genuine issues that both men and women face.Zach Braff and Jacinda Barrett are simply terrific in this film but the supporting cast is where there film really shows strength. Casey Affleck (Brother of Ben Affleck) and Marley Shelton are terrific as a married couple with child, struggling to make their marriage work. Rachel Bilson (OC) plays Kim, a young college student who is the temptation for Michael. And Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner (Meet The Parents) play Jenna's parents who have been married for 30 + years yet they too are having their problems.The Last Kiss was directed by Tony Goldwyn (Most notably Carl from Ghost.) He has come a long way since his acting debut in Friday The 13th Part VI: Jason Lives. Hopfully he continues to direct more films because he is quite good at it.This is a film I definitely recommend. It's a great coming of age story, especially for those who have or will be turning 30 sometime soon and are in some kind of relationship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the call of sidney poitier part 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>last time, I said famous black "saint" Sir sidney poitier should give those stupid young guys a good lesson about life and love..now I 'm afraid, our dear, honorable, respected Sir needs to come out again for another teach....the people in this movie mostly are ugly. the three guys Michael,Izzy, Kenny are obnoxiously ugly looking,Chris a pretty boy but a token gay(the director let you guess, though he got away from PC board himself) Marley Shelton is good looking but her screen time is too short. Blythe Danner, phenomenally gorgeous screen mom wastes pathetically.the guys in this movie suck the hell though most of them are over 30, still dress ,act ,talk like 20. all they can do is to be like slackers..their clothes are dirty, their personal hygiene is disgusting and dangerous(actually not their problem, they are still kids, living with their dad and mom)for the acting, Zach Braff probably did least lousy among the guys, but what a isosceles trapezoid looking ugly face!! with "albino" looking eyes. must be a loser in real life..watching those people who are less intelligent, less attractive, less moral than myself in cinema is so painful.well,sidney , take any girl you want..I know you will take good care of her, your words are not needed, I trust you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>painfully real...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Kiss, though at (many) times very funny, evoking much laughter and giggles from the audience, shadows us in doubt and darkness, painfully remaining parallel to the realistic screw-ups and cruelties in life. I wanted so much to step back into the sunshine, but like real life, I couldn't ignore the "crises" that lurked behind every scene--every action, everything. So. It's not one of those "feel-good" romantic comedies, (which I knew from the beginning, but secretly hoped I was wrong). But it is real, and it is true. And I mean, what more could you ask from a romantic movie, that shows "romance" in its real light? I guess in retrospect, this movie is not about romance. It's about love. The kind of love that messes a person up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was great. Zach did a wonderful job playing a character you love to hate. You see this movie from another point of view which is refreshing. Most people, unfortunately, can relate to this movie, whether you are cheating on someone or being cheated on or just stuck in a place in which you have no idea where you are. The movie is not intended to be a romantic comedy so ignore the comment above. Yes, the movie has some funny parts to it, but whose life doesn't. It is a wonderful movie and will get you to appreciate your partner and your life a little more. To all those who do wish to see this movie, I do not suggest you see it with your significant other as a date movie, go yourself....cry a little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hollow remake lacks punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "l'ultimo bacio" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265930/) is a truly excellent film. The writer and director have managed to evoke in the viewer a sense of internal conflict about each of the central characters. The differing threads of differing relationships are all bound intricately to deliver a strong central message. The morally challenging scenarios are strong and evoking, dividing the audience. It is the confronting nature of these scenarios and the characters within that MAKE this a great film.I had high hopes for the remake, being a big fan of several of the actors. However, once again this is a perfect example of how a director has been unable(?) to commit to the grittiness of the script, through censor pressure or otherwise, and as a result we are left with a shallow shell of a great film repackaged as a poor, weak swinging romance drama.Do yourself a favour and rent the original. It's great. I give the remake a 3 solely for the fact that it draws attention to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>totally sux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yo!!! I love Scrubs... And i thought that this movie will be something interesting as scrubs. But as i started watching this movie i realized that it is totally sucks.there are four stages taken from a real life. one of the guys is just breaking up with girlfriend and other one is nearly married...just married and last married and having a kid. Nothing special. I think this movie is mostly appretiated by girls. Cmn gents, tell me that this totally crap. Moreover, this kind of movies are specially shot to scare people. I mean nowadays, a lot of people are living without a family or married but no kids. So, this kind of movies drives people's attention and brainwashes most of 'em. All we know that having a family is a great thing. and having a kid/s in your family is the greatest thing. What else u guys wanna live for in this life???NAZARIK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible message for young girls and guys!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a very rare day that I ever rate a movie awful but this one deserves it. My friend and I went to this and we sat there in shock at the end, we could NOT believe what we had just watched, that that beautiful, kind-hearted young woman took that cheating dirt bag back. This movie teaches guys that it's okay to cheat as long as you say you're sorry. But much worse than that, it teaches young women that it's okay to allow a man to cheat on you, treat you like garbage and then take them back because "you are somehow partly responsible for their cheating." PUHLEASE!!!!! I have never been more disgusted by the terrible message that this movie is sending to young people! For all you young girls and guys who have watched this movie, I have a message for you: DON'T LISTEN TO THIS MOVIE! It is NEVER your fault that your partner cheats on you. Both partners have a part in a bad relationship, certainly; but only ONE partner has fault in the conscious choice to CHEAT! Cheating is NEVER the right choice. Do not be sucked in by this sappy movie. It's a disgrace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Start Your Date by Proving How Much Relationships Suck! Yeah, That's Perfect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Zach Braff. I love Tom Wilkinson. I even think Casey Affleck's not that bad and perhaps even better than his brother. But this movie... it's garbage. While it starts out as a seemingly simple dramedy with a pretty good script that makes the relationship between Braff's and Barrett's characters seem fairly realistic, this movie does nothing more than seek to give you no hope for relationships. Divorce, infidelity, pain... it's all here. And while by the end of the film they say you need to do "all that it takes," no one displays what that looks like anywhere through this film (unless you count sleeping on a porch "all that it takes" to keep a relationship together).The movie is depressing and nowhere near as powerful or likable as other films of its kind (if you want to see a better movie on infidelity and forgiveness, rent The Ice Storm). The only reasons I give this 3 stars out of 10 are the decent dialogue and okay performances. But seriously, this isn't an uplifting flick to take your date to. Avoid it if you can unless you think that all relationships (and especially marriages) suck, like these filmmakers apparently do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is A Remake, not a rip off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all you out there that keep stating that it maybe a rip off of the Italian movie 'L'ultimo Bacio', well i would like to tell you its not a rip off, its a remake.All the script writer has done is updated it for the 21st century. Just search for 'L'ultimo Bacio' on IMDb and read the plot summary.But for all those of you that cant be bothered, Here it is:'Carlo (Stefano Accorsi) is a twenty-nine-year-old man who works in an advertisement agency and has been living with his girlfriend Giulia (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) for three years. When she gets pregnant and he meets the stunning eighteen-year-old Francesca (Martina Stella), his relationship with Giulia moves into a crisis, since he is not ready to reach adulthood. Francesca has a crush on Carlo and dreams of him. His three best friends also have problems with their mates: Adriano (Giorgio Pasotti) has just had a son and has problems with taking the responsibilities of fatherhood, while his wife Livia (Sabrina Impacciatore) becomes very connected to the baby, neglecting their marriage; Alberto (Marco Cocci) has no ties with any woman, limiting to use them sexually; and Paolo (Claudio Santamaria) has a passion for his former lover. Meanwhile, Giulia's mother Anna (Stefania Sandrelli) has a middle-age crisis, jeopardising her marriage.'Anyway hope that helped clear that up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most honest movie about relationships for any generation...very funny moments, and some that make you cringe because they are too real. I highly recommend it...enough to register in order to comment.This will be a defining movie of our generation, a great follow up to Garden State. This movie doesn't tell you anything that you don't already know...but you will reexamine how you feel about love and how you show your love and commitment to those you are in love with. The parents help carry this movie, and while this might be too brutally honest for my parents to watch...I think it should be required watching for anyone thinking about getting married.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Kiss was watchable because</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>now if you look at who this movie isn't written by you think of Crash and Million Dollar baby and you start to put very high standards on this movie. Now I did not do that this movie is not perfect but it is very good and pretty funny while at the same time remaining serious. The acting was great, and the story compelling it is by no means extraordinary or even a new story but it is very well done, so no matter what critics say I suggest you find out for yourself. I saw it at a free screening Wednesday night and the crowd was enthusiastic, I mean a bunch of college kids are automatically drawn to Zach Braff movies after the Garden State, but don't compare this to Garden State it isn't the same thing. In its core it is about relationships and choices and what it is to make a wrong choice. Do not expect a life changing experience but it is enjoyable, a solid movie and a good story meant to be enjoyed perhaps a little reflection. One thing to keep in mind the preview for this movie is absolute crap and does not at all show its potential. Check it out for yourself</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>L'Ultimo Baccio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the original Italian version called, L'ultimo baccio, many times, and it's so much better!! It has always been one of my favorite movies. Maybe because I don't need the subtitles, but the American version really disappointed me. I really didn't feel that it had to be remade into an American version. That and the fact that I can't stand zach braff. Steffano Accorsi the Italian counterpart, is so much more convincing than zach. Actually everyone in the Italian movie is so much more convincing. From Giulia(the wife) to francesca, the young girl he falls for, well everyone in the movie for that matter.But that's just my opinion. But If you liked this movie though, check out the Original Italian version. You'll really appreciate it.The End</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just a reply</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I'm missing the point of the IMDb comments, but I have to say this. Maybe this film is a bit different than what its based on, but this was originally a French film, wasn't it? So if it degrades family values at all you should realize Americans aren't the only ones with these issues. Anywho, superj80, your reading too much into it just to be on the soapbox. People don't see foreign films and say, "Wow, Americans have really bad morals because this film depicts them making light of divorce and infidelity, I hate Americans after seeing this." I'd say if anything they'd wonder why we're so bothered by nudity and yet so obsessed with violence and vulgar humor (I say this admitting to my love of both). I better stop, but lastly I should I wonder how you can possibly imagine this American MOVIE can affect soldiers in other COUNTRIES...Hope no one minds my rant but I just don't think a movie deserves this rating because of these implications. Its like giving a porn flick a rating of 0 because you think porn is wrong. If you don't like the subject, its not for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Kiss was nothing more than a film about cheating deceit and lies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie not only showed but supported cheating, divorce, deceitfulness and lying. IT made it appear that the average American family is shallow and meaningless. If this is what Americans are all about, how can we expect to have any respect from other nationalities especially people who are our enemies. Half of the world is against America as it is, how can our soldiers have respectable authority in over seas countries when we make movies supporting immoral lifestyles. This movie is a disrespect to good loyal families who are trying to live a respectable lifestyle, You could not pay me to see this movie again! This is not a religious comment or a political comment in any way. I am just a concerned American sick of seeing us degrade ourselves on film for entertainment!!</fullReview>
