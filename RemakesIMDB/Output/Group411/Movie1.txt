		<shortDescription>Great movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GI Samurai was a great movie. Fans of Sonny Chiba should love this movie as did I. Basically, its about this platoon that is sent back in time to feudal Japan. Sonny Chiba plays the platoon's captain. The platoon is forced to fight the samurai clans, its cool to see the army weaponry going up against spears &amp; catapults. Forget plot, this movie doesn't need it, its chock full of war carnage &amp; some unbelievable special effects. The film ultimately turns anti-war with an unexpected ending that will stay with you for days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching the 139 min version (widescreen) with some friends and we were blown away. I won't bother repeating what others have said. What the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. The huge battle is exhausting. Afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didn't keep us from being completely involved and entertained.There is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific music/songs. Blues, Country/Folk and Rock Ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter. It's hideous. You have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you grounded.There are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many uses of silence as well as slow-motion photography that work beautifully. I really wish I could erase the music but alas.Seek this out. It's fun, it's different and it takes you to places you wouldn't expect and that's very refreshing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest tanks vs. Samurais movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pop quiz: you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history. What do you do? Well, if you're a Hollywood studio, you change the Japanese G.I.s in G.I. Samurai (aka Timeslip) to the crew of an American aircraft carrier, have them debate stopping the attack on Pearl Harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no-one reminds you that Japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this Sonny Chiba movie. But unlike its Hollywood counterpart The Final Countdown, this sees its premise through: thrown back 400 years into the Japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country ? cue lots of tank and helicopter vs. samurai action, including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other. And yes, there are decapitations.Of course, things don't go as planned, and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers. Even before that, the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the Hell of it. Impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through, the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they feature English lyrics sung by Japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language, but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner.Optimum's UK DVD is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would firstly say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood, I couldn't read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I did really like the concept. If you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie. That said, having just watched the restored 137 minute version on DVD I have to say I enjoyed it, though not as much as when I was seven ( I remembered the ending ). There are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism , the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments, my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music ( listen to the lyrics ). For an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll. By the ending of the movie I had decided that this was a good thing, when seven I though the 'relationship' guff was a bad thing.For an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action, especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of Shogun era warriors. The makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, lets face it, humorous. I thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when I was a kid, and I am not ashamed to say that I still do.I also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general don't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum, they've got heavy calibre machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, a tank and a helicopter and they're hell bent on making feudal Japan theirs. Which is what I'd like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots.In short the movies worth watching, it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise, and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like G.I. Samurai is so unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge body count and terrific entertainment. What more would you ask from a movie called G.I. Samurai?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if a platoon of G.I.'s from the Japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the Tokugawa Shogunate? Great pitch right? The movie does exactly what it says on the tin.Thankfully the writers didn't bother to explain the, usually ridiculous in sci-fi movies, scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport. No how's or why's. They just did. However the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful, if not a bit dated. Not as silly as one would imagine.The rest of the movie follows the premise to a T. But while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the G.I.s arrival to medieval Japan, it picks up with a devastating battle sequence. Undoubtedly it's the main order of the day. The whole concept and by extension the movie itself, was probably originated from this simple pitch: what if G.I.'s equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais? And boy does it deliver.The main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of THE best of its kind in 70's action/war movies. Not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length, it's also a terrific mish-mash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like G.I. Samurai can deliver. I mean, where else would you get the chance to feature tanks, ninjas complete with shuriikens, a helicopter and samurais in the same shot? The G.I. platoon led by lieutenant Iba tears literally through hundreds of extras, gunning them down with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks.This mish-mash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai-geki epic of Kurosawa's Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Banners, while the other is in western action and war movies. There are stylistic touches (like the wonderful slow-motion shots and bloody violence) that bring Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari circa Keoma to mind. Japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other Hollywood works and vice versa, and G.I. Samurai effortlessly turns this east-meets-west melting pot into an exciting film.The film-makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it. Not that tongue-in-cheek mentality is completely absent, it's just that it doesn't try to pander to so-bad-it's-good audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies. The budget was probably hefty, as it is evident in the hundreds of extras, elaborate costumes (very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai-geki) and special effects. The camera-work and editing are all top notch, almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves.It's not withouts its flaws either of course. There are many "song" scenes, where all sorts of 70's Japanese rock, disco and country songs play over montages (there's a bonding scene, a love-interest scene, a "war is hell" scene etc). The songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing. Although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes, it flies like a bullet for the most part. Still some scenes, flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect.The cast also deserves a mention, featuring such prominent names as Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin, Samurai Wolf), Tsunehiko Watase (The Yakuza Papers) and Hiroyuki Sanada, all of them hitting the right notes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the samurai genre meets time travel and modern weapons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GI SAMURAI is a film revolving around a platoon of japanese soldiers on manuvers with a helicopter, jeeps, and a tank who get time warped to the past during the fuedal era of the samurai. This film mixes the samurai martial arts genre with a tale of modern weapons against waves of 1000's japanese samurai on horses and on foot. A fantasy film that was fun to watch. The modern japanese troops end up battling for their lives in the past of japan. One of SONNY CHIBA's better films after the popular STREET FIGHTER series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More madness from Toho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"GI Samurai" sees Sonny Chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken feudal Japan for no particular reason, and much carnage ensues. It's a rather over the top essay of sword vs. machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting results.The plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title; initial fish-out-the-water antics ("what is this flying metal box?" etc etc), "aren't we better off here" discussions and ultimately a huge battle. The latter is proof that the film doesn't take itself seriously at all, the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles Chiba's platoon; a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to overwhelm with its inventiveness and extravagance. It's certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and doesn't drag despite its extended length.Chiba gives a gruff performance as Iba, initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him. This is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific CV. By the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers, as they seem to be asking "weren't we better off back then?'. But this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of (almost) non stop action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite Japanese films - up there with Battle Royale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typically intense ? not to mention insane ? example of a Japanese B-movie, that actually feels like an EPIC thanks to its non-stop action, carnage, chaos, and plenty more besides. The plot is one of those simplistic one sentence ideas you can just imagine some powerful executive in an office had "let's see a war fought between samurai soldiers and modern army officers!". The execution is splendid, gory, violent, and everything else that you could hope for. The time slip itself is hilarious, a plethora of cheap flashing lights and plenty other weirdness which set the time of production firmly within the 1970s.Once the action starts to beef up it doesn't let up at all, right until the climax. The last thirty-forty minutes depicts a war between modern and ancient soldiers and is as gratuitous, exciting and adrenaline-pumping as you could ever hope for. Top-notch choreography by martial arts legend Sonny Chiba and some outstanding makeup effects/costumes help add to the realism. Hard man hero Chiba also stars as Iba, the tough, power-hungry lieutenant who leads the modern day army, and his acting skills are as good as ever. I love the scene where he turns into a hard-ass at the end of the film, riding horses and kicking backside all over the shop. It's one of his best performance and I would put this up there with THE STREET FIGHTER as his two best movies. "Don't cry ? fight!" is one of the many classic lines he gets to deliver at the film progresses.Those of a squeamish disposition note, this film is full of gory bullet hits and some damned explicit decapitations which seem to come out of nowhere! Gotta love those arrow hits, though, which are truly hilarious. Anyone who has seen a '70s Japanese samurai film will know the level of violence to expect from this one. The war itself is the best part of the film, a truly frenetic and often horrific experience showing the true terrors of warfare; the action and death is often enhanced by an experimental soundtrack in which moments of dead silence add to the viewing experience. Animal-lovers would also be well advised to look elsewhere as the film has dozens of violent horse falls, where the horse's legs are yanked out with wire leaving the horses crippled and likely to be sent to the knacker's yard. No wonder this was extensively cut ? in an extremely bizarre way ? for its 18 certificate UK release. Cut or not, this is an outrageous and dramatic movie which despite being downbeat offers up an amazing good time. Check it out!NB: Since I wrote this review, I've bought the DVD under the better title, G. I. SAMURAI. Seen in a widescreen print, with an extra thirty minutes added to the proceedings, I'm now convinced this is a masterpiece which belies its B-movie budget. The cost of kitting out the hundreds of Samurai warriors must have been huge and the authenticity is spot on throughout. The opening time-slip isn't too bad and in fact is the only moment in the whole film that the thing feels cheesy. Elsewhere the viewer runs the gamut of emotions from A-Z, from happiness, and outlandish joy, through to sadness, and downbeat misery. Suspense is top-notch throughout and great performances from an entire cast ? especially the actor who plays the samurai commander ally. I love this film to bits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What time is it? It's Chiba time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Who is Sonny Chiba? He is... he is bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies today". So explains Clarence Worley in True Romance, a man who clearly knows his shizzle when it comes to Asian action stars. G.I. Samurai is the third flick I've seen from the dirt-cheap, 4-film Chiba box-set I bought from ebay, and it's the third winner in a row, a hugely entertaining sci-fi tinged action/adventure that ploughs through its 139 minutes like a 50-calibre machine gun through an army of warring-era Japanese soldiers.Chiba plays Lt. Yoshiaki Iba, leader of a Japan Ground Self-Defense Force squadron that 'slips' through time, arriving in feudal Japan, where they join forces with a power hungry samurai planning to become the country's next ruler. The script doesn't concern itself with the whys and wherefores of the squadron's predicament, quickly glossing over the time travel nonsense in order to concentrate on the job at hand: pitting the modern-day soldiers, with their powerful weaponry, against hordes of warriors armed with swords, arrows, spears and throwing stars (oh yes, there will be ninjas!).A couple of quieter moments do allow for that other all important staple of exploitative Japanese cinema?gratuitous female nudity?as several of Iba's men go AWOL for a rape and pillage spree, while a few others pay a visit to an obliging local widower; for the most part, however, it's loud, relentless, and bloody stuff, with Chiba proving Clarence to be right on the money with his assessment of the star: whether suspended from a helicopter firing a machine gun, riding a horse while firing a bow and arrow, or taking on a warlord with a broken sword, Sonny kicks serious ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Samurai Night Fever..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got the Sonny Chiba, 4 disc collection because of one movie..."G.I.Samurai". I was not disappointed. The plot in a nutshell is... a small group of Japanese Defense Force soldiers go back in time 400 years and fight samurais. Made in 1979, this movie delivers some ultra-battle action! The group of about twenty guys, led by Sonny Chiba, whose character's name I can no longer remember, find themselves propelled backwards, somehow, to feudal Japan, via a "Time Slip", (this movies alternate title, among others). The special effects are somewhat shoddy but they work. Not only are the men flung back into time but get this, a tank, half-track, jeep with .50 cal. machine gun, supply truck, helicopter and a freakin' patrol boat also! They find themselves in the middle of a feud between the local warlords, one of whom takes a fancy to them. They decide to team up with this guy and take over ancient Japan. Forget about messing with the space/time continuum,in battle after battle, many, many samurais and foot soldiers are gunned down, blowed up, and generally done away with, without regard to the historical consequences. The soldiers have a seemingly inexhaustible supply of ammo. Clocking in at over two hours, we have all sorts of Japanese tomfoolery to contend with. There is some truly awful music sprinkled throughout,some with English lyrics. I liked this movie, a lot. There are so many things about this movie to like and few reasons not to. I cannot remember all the elements in this movie...there was just too much going on. Ha. The soundtrack was Japanese with English subtitles. I understand there is a chopped up, English language version out there too, which should be avoided.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japan Defense Force soldiers finds themselves in Feudal Era Japan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a novel by Ryo Hanmura, Sengoku Jieitai is a story about a unit of Japanese Defence Force that finds themselves in the middle of feudal era Japan due to time slip.21 Japan Defence Force (JDF) soldiers who were on a training mission in Toyama prefecture suddenly gets transported to feudal era Japan and meets Nagao Kagetora (Isao Natsuyagi) - a feudal era warlord. Capt. Iba (Shinichi Chiba) of JDF gets an ambition to take over the country using superior weaponry of modern JDF force.This was the fourth attempt by Kadokawa Publishing to be in the movie business. Toho movie studio became the distributor of this movie so Toho's logo appears in the beginning, but the movie is made by Kadokawa. Producer Haruki Kadokawa himself makes an appearance as one of the JDF soldier.Producer Haruki Kadokawa wanted to create a movie that had appeal to the younger viewers, and inserted blues and rock and roll based music into the movie even if it interrupted the flow of the movie. Young musicians and singers of the era such as Hiromitsu Suzuki, Hiroshi Kamayatsu, Ryudo Uzaki, Akira Nishikino, and Nana Okada made appearance in the movie to support this end.The novel was the first science fiction that tried to accurately explore the "What if" scenario of modern technology making its way into past history. Other works have followed since such as "Jipang", and "Konpeki no Kantai". The movie follows its original intent and depict the interaction between JDF soldiers and the samurai as realistically as possible.The movie was cut into 95 minutes in the US released version titled "GI Samurai". The original Japanese version runs for 139 minutes.The movie version ends differently from the novel. In the original novel, the crew of JDF soldiers ends up altering their version of "history" to ironically match the known history. The original story showed how small human intent is compared to the wisdom of nature. Idea of matching modern soldiers against samurai is a novel idea which makes this an interesting movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie partially ruined with cheesy screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The battle sequence which comprises almost half of the movie is breathtaking, it can't be better than that, no one in Hollywood can claim that he or she can create something better however the movie suffered from some facts.1. A battle group travels in time for unknown reason. I can buy that. You can give the audience every possible "Make sense" fact for the time travel but at the end, time travel is still considered a myth and no one knows if it's even possible, some argue it's not as we had no visitors from the future in the known well documented history so not giving the audience any fact for time travel is not really a problem. It just happened. It's OK.2.Iba suppressed the mutiny and regained control of the patrol boat. Then he made the most ridiculous and insane move. He blew the boat. Even if he had no use for the boat, he had to keep so he can use the diesel in the tank and tucks, yet he blew the boat with all the fuel and I assume with everything inside it including the ammo.3. It is a known fact that tanks are short range vehicles. You can't just marsh half of the country with a tank in single tank of fuel. It is just impossible. In the beginning we see that they just march with the tank back and forth (wasting the fuel) and then marching with the tank to the battle. Even by 1940s standard, that was just ridiculous.4. Same thing goes with the helicopter. Helicopters do not fly on nuclear fuel, they run on gas and they are not a regional passenger jet. Again we see that he flies the copter just to show off like there is no future.5. They waste ammo just to show off!6. Iba marches with the entire battle group without protecting his rear. Japan is not a big country. He had to save the patrol boat for escape and if he wanted march, he had to do it along the coast line so at least he had protected back. Coming from the future, he had the precise map of Japan's coast line so he could find a strategic peninsula, secured from 3 sides with water and gun boat and entrench on the land connection, try to lure the enemy to his position. Of course if they wanted to play it right, they had to re wright the whole screenplay but considering the insane effort they put into creating such awesome battle sequence, it was worth it. This movie had the potential of being a cinematic epic/classic.7. So he marches inland with his battle group which in reality suffered from shortage of ammo an fuel with absolutely no supply line. They got encircled and... It was very well made. They lost everything. Historically such thing happened in WWII when Germans sneaked into soviet line to Stalingrad and everyone knows the outcome. No army commander sneaks into enemy line without having a solid and well protected supply line unless he is on suicide mission! So, aside from some entertainment factor, the movie was a total disaster.Soundtrack was good except for the fact that the Japanese singer was singing the mix of English and Japanese... Whenever I heard a song, I wanted to hit my head to the wall.Overall the concept was good, we saw the concept in several western movies like the "Timeline" and I bet we will continue to see more movies based on similar concept in the future. I would say 6/10. The production was so good that I can not downgrade the movie as much as I like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from controversial acting, directing, plot etc. there is one particular aspect of this movie thats is actually bad unconditionally.If one would judge by "Sengoku Jieitai", one would conclude that JGSDF is the worst disciplined and trained army in the world, assembled by drafting idiots with criminal tendencies.Samurai tactics against modern soldiers, shown in the movie, is remarkably decent to my surprise. It might even work IRL - well, if modern soldiers were indeed that stupid and untrained. Modern soldiers' tactics is just plain ridiculous - "WTF are they doing?!!" was all I could think about watching the otherwise spectacular final battle.In my opinion, this movie creates a very bad image of JGSDF.It also seems that there's not even single one positive character - anyone who's not an extra is either plain bad or just repulsive person. Even Lt. Iba (Sonny Chiba) - being badass - is also bad and an ass. Well, at least we have two badass guys here.</fullReview>

My copy barely hits 60 mins and the hacked editing shows in a very obvious way. There is little explanation of what is going on; the prostitute from the past seems to be still working at the brothel in the late 1970s; a Samurai appears riding a horse down the street in the 1970s for NO reason and while the ending is reminiscent of Macbeth there is a much a much stronger feeling of MacDuff to the whole finished product.

There is nothing wrong with the idea, modern day Japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of Busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything. When the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say "Hey my watch has stopped"? Imagine lines like that being repeated 15+ times before they say anything else and you have the movie's lack of greatness in a nutshell.</fullReview>
