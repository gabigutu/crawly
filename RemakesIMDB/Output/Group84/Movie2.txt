		<shortDescription>Nice easy viewing light hearted musical skating comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice musical comedy starring great skater Sonja Henie as a false countess and Olga San Juan as her maid looking for fun in a ski resort. Pay special attention to the Carmen Miranda style number, including non skating routines that miss Henie plays pretty well. Not being an actress she plays the role in a very convincing way. Also a mention to Olga San Juan, an underrated actress that sadly made only a few films although her comedy talent deserved better roles. Michael Kirby as Henie's love interest and Hugh French as her partner in crime do also play their roles properly. Character actor Arthur O'Connell -here without moustache- plays an assistant director in his usual well doing way. Other appearances include Ray Teal -Bonanza sheriff- and Dorothy Hart as Michael Kirby's fiancée. A pity that it wasn't filmed in bright Technicolor as it was originally planned to be.</fullReview>
