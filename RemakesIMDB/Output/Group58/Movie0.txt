		<shortDescription>A Truly Unforgettable Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death and what it means is the theme of the haunting and sensuous Ballad of Narayama, a Cannes Film Festival Grand prize winner from 1982 by Shohei Imamaura (Black Rain, The Eel, Dr. Akagi). Based on a novel by Shichiro Fukazawa, this spellbinding film takes place in a rural mountainous area in northern Japan about one hundred years ago. Because the villager's rice crop is meager and starvation is a chronic threat, according to village custom, the elderly must go to die on the summit of Mount Narayama when they reach the age of 70. Group survival depends on it and death is accepted as a fact of life in the village. I must admit I had a hard time during the first hour being engaged with this film and sorting out all the characters. I found the graphic depiction of the cruel realities of village life to be ugly and often vulgar. For example, one character has sex with a village dog, an entire family is buried alive because they have been accused of stealing, and two snakes copulate next to a couple's sexual encounter in the woods. As the film progressed, however, I found it easier to accept how the brutal struggle for survival ensures continuance and self-preservation.The story concerns Orin (Sumiko Sakamota) who, in her seventieth year, must complete all the loose ends in her life before she goes to die. One widowed son must find a new wife, another has to sleep with a woman for the first time, and the third needs to be taught manners. When Orin realizes it is her time to be taken to Narayama, her son Tatsuhei (Ken Ogata) carries his mother to the mountain on his back in scenes of ethereal beauty reminiscent of Sokurov's Mother and Son. The resistance of Tatsuhei to his mother's death is familiar, yet nonetheless deeply moving. At the end of the journey, Orin clings to her resolve with tenacity and reconciliation to the inevitable. Sitting on the mountain close to her God, she is rewarded by the sudden grace of the silent snow.Watching Ballad of Narayama I was forced to confront my own feelings about the morality of suicide. Both during and since viewing the film, I have been haunted by the idea of a loved one slowly freezing to death on a mountain--for my benefit. Although I do not approve of taking one's life as a general ethic, I found Imamura's conception to be so deeply human that it became both tragic and immensely moving. The film functions on a level well beyond pat moralizing, showing the extremes that people will go to out of love for each other, and the grace that can be bestowed on such acts of sacrifice. It is truly unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my five favorite movies ever - What is uniquely human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With beautiful photography and sensitive, elegant acting, this is perhaps the best exploration of what it means to be human. As usual, Shohei Imamura draws direct parallels between the basic drives &amp; instincts (hunger, greed, lust, anger, envy) of people and other animals. I have friends who have walked out of this movie because they found these comparisons so depressing when shown in the desperately poor rural Japan during the late 19th century. What they missed was the core intelligence, caring, self sacrifice, clear thinking and love that enabled that community, and by extension the human race, to survive such difficult times.This sympathetic portrayal of a family in a rural village is the best of ten films I have seen from Imamura, with an epic scale of Akira Kurosawa and all of the subtlety of Ozu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, yes. Captivating, certainly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about a culture that has evolved to deal with food scarcity. The people of the village have taken their choices to the extreme. Food is so hard to get (and keep) that the very old and very young must leave. Babiy boys are left to die in the snow, baby girls are raised only to be sold, and the old are brought to the mountain to die. The only thing there is plenty of is sex, for all but one man called Stinker by his peers.The villagers are intent to secure life for themselves and their family and will do anything necessary. In the middle of this all lives an old lady, almost 70 (the dying age) but healthy and strong. She does not want to burden the family, so she gives up her place in order for the young ones to live.Imamura registers all this without judgment. This is a lesson to most people, filmmakers in particular. See, feel, but don't judge right away. See, feel, think, and then try to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harsh yet beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually an extraordinarily beautiful film, if one has even the remotest understanding of Japanese culture around that time period. The harshness of life in Japan made the sort of society in which people went to "be with their loved-ones" and "be with the God of the Mountain" at age 70 completely necessary. The focus of the film is the struggle for survival, and more than that, prospering, in the harsh environment of c. XIX Tohoku. The exploration of this topic takes the viewer into a study of survival through strict rules, and prospering through sexual relationships. The scenes of sexual intercourse serve to portray that even in sexual situations, the Japanese as a people have never viewed nature and animals as separate from ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough stuff but asks the basic questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little surprised by a few of the negative comments below since I don't consider this film to be at all slow or dull. Many foreign and Asian films (Tsai Ming-Liang, Apitchatpong Weerasethakul, Hou Hsiao-Hsien for example)are far more grueling and slow whereas this film is loaded with narrative events, humor, eroticism (of various sorts, not all involving contact between humans and other humans)and a profound meditation on community, responsibility and mortality. If one finds this slow then I'd imagine most foreign films besides Amelie would be off-limits. I have rarely seen a film that forces one to confront such disturbing yet important subjects. In this village where scarcity forces all over 70 to be taken to Narayama mountain to die, a 69 year old woman who is still energetic and capable must settle her son's affairs before taking her final journey. Pondering how one would live in a place where for years one would know that at 70 this would happen is one key question. Further, what are the final things one must do before dying. Finally, the film makes us confront the literal truth of bodily decay and corruption in the scenes at Narayama Mountain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most beautiful and moving motion pictures I have ever seen. The extreme hardships faced by the people in this story are presented frankly and unsentimentally. The cinematography is absolutely exquisite, particularly the last 10-15 minutes. Although the film never gives in to or panders to sentimentality (sentimentality, Imamura?), the end is really a tear-jerker. As much as I hate to make lists of my "favorite things", this movie would definitely rate among my top ten of all times. Do yourself a favor and see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shohei Imamura : A true master of human emotions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On numerous occasions Japanese filmmaker Shohei Imamura has confessed that he is more interested in filming tales of despicable low lives than narrating stories of hypocrite Japanese middle class.This is precisely what makes his film special.It must be mentioned that an earlier version of this film was made in 1958 by veteran Japanese film maker Kinoshita Keisuke.Imamura has often stated that his film is more sensual than that of Kinoshita as it featured a Kabuki style narration of events.Ballad of Narayama is a film about ancient traditions which are hard to follow.It takes place in a Japanese village where a majority of inhabitants are low lives who lead a not so decent life.As traditions are to be respected there is a lot of respect for elders. The highlight of the film is the existential dilemma of a Japanese man whose task consists of leaving his old mother in the mountains of Narayama to be eaten alive by vultures.It is believed that forthcoming generations will live when sacrifices are made by old people.It is amazing how Imamura has managed to recreate a vivid life of ancient Japanese village.Ken Ogata is a joy to watch as an obedient son who hesitates to see his old mother die.A truly great film to learn about the eccentricities of human mind especially of the oriental kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Ballad of Narayama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not difficult to understand why Ballad of Narayama won the Palme d'Or in 1983. Beautifully filmed and probably just about having a little something for everyone, I felt that this was without a doubt the best of the Shohei Imamura movies shown today to commemorate his passing last year, and on what would have been a celebration of his birthday should he still be alive today.Like the timeless setting in The Profound Desire of the Gods, Imamura's story, a reinterpretation of the book Men of Tohoku by Fukuzawa Shichiro, takes place ambiguously "100 years ago" within a self-supporting nomad group of villagers atop a mountain, where tribal life, ritualistic and tightly knit, involves a peculiar practice when one reaches the age of 70. There's forceful retirement, where the elderly has to ascend Narayama and live out the rest of the days there. The mountain top is the senior citizen's home, and everyone dutifully follows this without question.And I'd like to reflect on this particular point before dwelling on the others. Watching Ballad brings to mind the thought of death, and how would one decide how to go meet the maker. There's absolutely nothing worse than anticipating the coming of death, or to the point of sadism, to actually add a catalyst to it. The final 30 minutes is nothing short of powerful, where son Tatsuhei (Ken Ogata) journeys with mother Orin (Sumiko Sakamota) up the incline. It balances the stoic, unspoken bonds (one of the conditions in the ascent is to maintain silence) of love with the coming of the reaper with every step inching closer to the summit where the gods are, set against beautiful mountainous scenery. My words fall short of describing this awesome moment, and it's something you just have to see for yourself. And with that, comes the point of dying with dignity. If I choose to go, that's the way I would prefer too, rather than screaming, kicking up a fuss, and cursing everyone else.The movie follows through this anticipation of the journey with preparation, and showcases the life of Orin and her family, which is nothing short of entertaining with the many facets thrown in. It's drama, comedy and loads of sex in the veins of the 40 Year Old Virgin, but these are basically there as Orin tries her best to tie up loose ends and puts in place some continuity within her family members before her time is up. Things like taking an involvement to ensure one of her sons doesn't stay a virgin (this bit is just plain hilarious with the way it was developed), and with lots of love, teaching her daughter-in-law how to provide for the family.It's curious to note that Imamura has plenty of National Geographic like shots of various animals, like snakes, toads, owls and crows, and more often than not, showing them in various stages of copulation, or worse, devouring one another. These shots are used as fillers, as if to either remind you before or after a scene, that when boiled down to basics, we are still animals with our primal instincts still very much intact. And if we're left to our own community devices, mob justice, just like the one in Profound, is often very brutal with emotions running high, and this particular thread, including the cunning involvement of Orin, was one that I found quite hard to sit through - the motivation for a daughter-in-law (one that she didn't approve of) was basically to provide for her own kin, but the stark punishment met out, in my opinion, unforgettable, unforgivable, and very excessive.Ballad of Naray ama deserves every accolade bestowed upon it, and amongst the Imamura movies seen to date, this is something that I would recommend without hesitation. Forget the synopsis which made it sound boring, the real deal is within the film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shocking, depressing, and even humorous depiction of a villages efforts to survive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ballad of Narayama" is ultimately a film about survival.Set during the Meiji Period, the inhabitants of a tiny Japanese farming village are forced to embrace extreme tactics to ensure that they stay alive.Male babies are instantly killed with hardly any remorse, while females are usually sold. Stealing food is punishable by death, which we see in a very disturbing scene where an entire family are buried alive due their father's crime.And, ultimately, the elderly are sent to die at the base of a mountain called Narayama when they reach the age of 70.Despite the depressing tone, there is a lot of humor in this film, as well. The songs that the villagers sing about each other are pretty funny, and it's difficult not to laugh at Old Orin trying to knock her own teeth out with a rock.Speaking of Old Orin, the actress who player her (Sumiko Sakamoto) gives a wonderful performance in this film. She had her teeth surgically removed for this role, and gives a realistic depiction of a 70-year-old woman even though she was in her 40s when the film was made."Ballad of Narayama" is indeed a depressing film in many aspects, but it's also filled with humor and offers a better understanding of what life must be like in these types of situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based of the old and unusual Japanese legend, Shohei Imamura's "The Ballade of Narayama" won the Golden Palm in 1983 Cannes Festival. Set in the 19th century in a remote mountain village in the north of the country, it tells of the custom according to which when a person reached 70 years old they were taken to the top of Mount Narayama and left there to die.When I saw "The Ballade of Narayama" back in the 80s, I did not know anything about it. There were no commercials; the film was not widely released. I think it was only two shows in the theater near our house in Moscow. All we knew that the film was a Cannes Festival winner. Our sons were little then, we did not have a babysitter, and we bought tickets to two different shows. My husband went first, and when he came back, I waited for him at the door, ready to leave. He looked quiet, serious and withdrawn when he returned home. I asked him how the movie was and he said to me to go and see it, and then we'd talk...After I came home, I did not want to talk, I did not know what to say, I was overwhelmed - with the unique style of film-making that I did not know even existed, with the images, but also with the very simplicity of the story and with the whole concept of surviving above everything else. Among the most devastating scenes for me was the old woman readily and happily accepting her turn to be taken to Narayma. The woman of perfect health and mind, the one who is perhaps the sanest in her family is so tired of this life that she on purpose knocks out one of her teeth just to seem older, more fragile, helpless, and ill and to be taken to the long -awaited rest. But before she is taken to Naryama, she will take care of her three grown sons' problems.There are many unforgettable scenes in the film, both bleak and life-affirming. One stands out after all these years. There is a shining brilliant spring day, and every living creature in sight is engaged in love, young couple on the swing, birds, animals, and snakes - the whole nature celebrates life and longing and love. And soon after that, as the contrast, the horrifying scene where the family of thieves who had stolen some food from the neighbors are buried alive.And there is the final part - the ascent to Narayama, the middle-aged son carries his mother to her final resting place, the last minutes between a son and his mother, and then, the snow in the end, white and pure, covering the earth and preparing it for the long sleep, and covering the old Orin, comforting her softly and preparing her for eternity...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a person visits cinema to see a movie, he/she usually expects to see filmed version of some story, whatever the film story shall be. So, let's go and see the Narajama story! Well, Legend of Narajama to me was much more than that. It's expressiveness is above the term "story", "film" etc. It is one o the most incredible things I have seen in my life (beside Rodin's Kiss in his Paris museum, and Trier's Dancer in the dark and few more exceptional works of ... let's use the word "art"). Shockingly naturalizing presentation of way of living in rural part of Japan, simpleness of characters' acceptance of facts of life (giving life for others' survival), nativeness of roles are probably main attributes.I've seen it in the year 1984/85, fortunate me, for until tonight's IMDb's Narajama appearance to me this movie has been totally gone. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a shocker, which opens on a villager finding a dead newborn boy on his field? His only resentment is: why HIS field was chosen? The fact of murdering a baby doesn't seem to concern anyone in this hunger-stricken small village, population of which must adhere to rather radical if cruel set of regulations in order to secure the survival of their community. Set in the late 19th Century, this film will leave you to ponder the structure of our own society as you'll find many parallels with modern day. An unforgettable experience! This masterpiece is not for those who expect to be entertained. Be prepared to be haunted by the scenes of brutality and sexual fervor long after the movie is over.

		<shortDescription>Brutally Basic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed on DVD. Restoration = ten (10) stars; subtitles =eight (8) stars. Director Shouhei Imamura's imaginative view of what life might have been like in a dirt-poor, isolated, small village during Japan's feudal era. The film operates at two basic levels: entertainment and cultural analysis. The Director introduces and nourishes a pretty full range of very fundamental human emotions and life conditions in this cinematic Petri Dish including superstitious behavior and sexual worship. Acting is a bit on the hammy side and some scenes are too long. The latter is especially the case for the sequence depicting the village's solution to the problem of an aging population: haul/backpack healthy seniors to a distant mountain bone yard and leave them there to die from starvation and the elements. Cinematography (wide screen, color) and set design are good given that exteriors seem to have been shot entirely on location (often in what seems to be five feet--or more--of snow). The overly-long opening sequence shot from a helicopter, though, is a bit shaky. Jump-cut editing can be sloppy with snow banks incredulously appearing in or disappearing from contiguous scenes. Subtitles consist of two information streams: at the top of the screen appear thoughtful notes on culture and language while the bottom presents reasonably edited translations of dialog (either or both streams can be turned off). Score is sporadic but okay. Interior scene lighting can be on the dim side. Recommend viewing this gem a couple of times to discover all it has to offer. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ballad of Narayama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this Japanese film in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I read the description of the story and found the title intriguing, and I hoped it would deserve four stars out of five critics give it. Basically in a small rural village in 19th century Japan, according to tradition, once a man or woman reaches the age of 70 they must go through a practise known as ubasute, where they will travel to a remote mountain to die of starvation. The story follows 69-year- old Orin (Sumiko Sakamoto) and in sound health of course, but she knows that a neighbour father had to be dragged up the mountain by his son. Orin resolves to avoid clinging onto life beyond her term and spending a year arranging all her family affairs and the village for when she passes away. These include Orin severely punishing a family who are hoarding food, and helping her younger son lose his virginity, but in the end she ultimately faces up to tradition and is taken up the mountain. Also starring Ken Ogata as Tatsuhei, Tonpei Hidari as Risuke "Smelly", Aki Takejô as Tamayan, Shôichi Ozawa as Katsuzô / Shozo, Sanshô Shinsui as Zeniya no Tadayan, Seiji Kurasaki as Kesakichi and Junko Takada as Matsuyan. The story is interesting with harsh moments with the subjects of rape, famine, mortality, birth and death, throughout it all there also cutaways to the natural world, with animals, ultimately it is about trying to evade the final journey, I may have lost track slightly, but overall it is a splendid drama.

		<shortDescription>The Ballad of Narayama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Shichiro Fukazawa's novel (which was already adapted by Keisuke Kinoshita in 1958), Shohei Imamura's The Ballad of Narayama follows a rural 19th century village whose people barely survive on their rations each year and life is a constant struggle. The magnificent aerial shots of winter landscape in the beginning almost lose their charm after we witness the brutal life conditions down in the village.The main character is an old woman named Orin, who is almost 70 and therefore should prepare for climbing a nearby mountain called Narayama to die there, according to a cruel tradition known as "ubasute". She's in fairly good health, but nevertheless insists on dying on the mountain top. She isn't painted as a completely positive character, but even though she can be ruthless, she's one of the few characters who do have a moral code. The heart of the film is the 30-minute ending sequence where Orin, carried by her son, haphazardly treks through the path to her death, and finally sits to die in midst of a crow infested, open graveyard of a cave. This long sequence has almost no dialogue, but is very substantial, meditative and wonderful in its own way.There are quite a few provocative images - a dead baby in the snow, a family getting buried alive for stealing, or the sight of Orin's sexually frustrated grandson having sex with a dog. The village scenes are often interrupted by the scenes of various animals hunting, copulating and giving birth, which respectively correspond to the scenes of human characters hunting, having sex and discussing pregnancy. Imamura shows us that there's a thin line between humans and other animals, which gets even more enhanced by the village's hard core life conditions. The only thing that distances humans from animals are the village traditions, which may seem brutal, but are viewed as necessary by the villagers (most of them).All four seasons change throughout the film and we see their influence on the natural landscapes, which is set to Shinichiro Ikebe's excellent soundtrack. The movie both begins and ends coated in snow, which makes its world seem more cyclical and rhythmical. There are short bits played in slow motion and some scenes in which the colors switch to shades of blue. The visual approach is overall pretty interesting. The movie may be too long, but it's still a great family tale about cultural traditions clashing with the individuals' desires in a harsh setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life, Life In Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not, as of this writing, seen Kinoshita's 1958 film, but I'm able to remedy that since Criterion are releasing it on Blu-ray in February. It'll be interesting to compare.Imamura's film is, as one might expect, quite explicit, not least because of his naturalistic documentarian eye. This is way too explicit for my taste, but on the other hand it successfully captures that certain apprehensiveness that perhaps should be evoked in the face of the kind of deleterious brutality that society is capable of, the connivance and all.But first and foremost it all crescendoes to the climatic mountain scenes, the most lucid film-making in Imamura's oeuvre, and absolutely among the most shockingly meaningful, moving and unforgettable images ever put to film. There is the pit (echoing an earlier Imamura film), but it's the mountain that from very early on becomes the leading motif: the mundane vs. the sacred/traditional, the beastly vs. the elevated spirit, life vs. life in death, and so on. But Imamura's sly sense of humanity reminds us where we're coming from after we have started descending from the mountain. The counterpoint of what happens (Tatsuhei is the dumbstruck witness of this) just after we have departed from Orin is genius in its intensity and, yes, brutality. The contrasting elements of peace and violence, dignity and ignobility, solemnity and bitter farce, are so expertly threaded through that the effect of that one short moment left a deep mark in me. I can't say that for many moments in film, no matter how wonderful images I've witnessed. I can see myself visiting that sumptuous ending for years to come.Released on Blu-ray in Region B by the Masters of Cinema series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite very high ratings, the sledgehammer symbolism and overall unpleasantness are serious problems with this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of "The Ballad of Narayama" has a very respectable rating of 7.7 and lots of very positive reviews. However, I found the film to be an endurance contest of unpleasantness. It also made its point through TONS of what my daughter terms 'sledgehammer symbolism'--where the director tries so hard to put forth their symbolism that it all becomes too tiresome and too obvious. Subtle this movie isn't! This film is set in a time and place in Japan where life is very, very hard and starvation is the norm. To deal with this, the lovely people in these mountains have a tradition--that their elderly should go up in the mountains to die when they reach 70 so that they aren't a burden. Additionally, infanticide, stealing food and all other forms of nastiness abound in this hellish place. But director/writer Shôhei Imamura doesn't stop there--the film also has scenes of bestiality, LOTS of sex scenes (not the sexy kind, either), a family being buried alive, a woman knocking out her own teeth, a guy tossing his father down a mountain and animal abuse! Somehow Imamura seems to have forgotten necrophilia and incest! As far as the symbolism goes, Imamura shows innumerable scenes of animals eating each other or copulating. It's VERY obvious he's trying to draw a parallel to say that these people are living like animals...too obvious. Plus, call me crazy, but I don't want to see all these scenes of animals killing each other or having sex!! Life is too short to watch stuff like this and although "The Ballad of Narayama" has nice production values, the thoroughly unpleasant nature of the film make it hard to recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AnimEigo's June 2008 DVD release of The BALLAD of NARAYAMA has been eagerly awaited for many years. Unfortunately, and for reasons that are as infuriating as they are inexplicable, the company which has released the film (AnimEigo) has issued it in "full screen format" and not in Anamorphic Widescreen. This is particularly annoying for two rather considerable reasons: 1) On the box, it says "Anamorphic Widescreen," - that is "letterboxed" - but it clearly is not; I have checked out the print sent to me by NetFlicks and then at a local Video shop. 2) The film's enormously high reputation is based in great measure on its superlative cinematography and this butchered version released by AnimEigo ruins the imagery and the enjoyment of the film.The company should not be allowed to assert that the film is in ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN when it is not.

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film documents a feudal village in the distant past that lays below the mountain Narayama. By tradition, when people reach the age of 70, they are carried up the mountain by their oldest son and left their to die. Sumiko Sakamoto starts the film as a 69 year-old woman, and the film takes place over the final year of her life. The film ends with the aforementioned trek. The rest of it just shows how these people exist. There is a horrible threat of starvation for everyone there, and their entire lives revolve around it. Only the oldest child (Ken Ogata in Sakamoto's case) is allowed to marry and reproduce. The second child (Tonpei Hidari in the main family) only exists to help with farm work. Any other male children are generally left to die from exposure as infants. Girl children can be sold to salt merchants if a family so decides. I really like stories about societies that are forced to live in harsh conditions. This film is reminiscent of things like Man of Aran and Kaneto Shindo's The Island. It's quite a bit harsher than those, actually. Yet Imamura finds a deep humanity in these people, and he weaves a beautiful mosaic of how they exist within the natural world. The world of the film is so vivid that it really draws you in. Kinoshita previously made a film of the same novel in 1958 which I would love to see, but Imamura's version is pretty much a perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living in the wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie kind of reminded me of Walkabout, only for later in life as opposed to a coming-of-age story. True, the concerns and formal elements are different between the two movies, but movies have a near obsessive relationship to animal and natural grotesqueries in the area the characters inhabit to make a point about the danger and painfulness of life. In the case of Ballad of Narayama, citizens of a remote village are forced to struggle daily just to live, and in their habits and rules are even sometimes driven to disturbing heights of passion in order just to survive.I saw this movie as part of a sort of double feature of Imamura movies with Vengeance is Mine, and one thing I really like about both movies is the way Imamura holds the camera back and lets the frame be filled with lush visuals of everything that's going on and matters to the characters. In this case, the distance helps remove the viewer to become something of a spectator of the village life, kind of like a National Geographic documentary only with much more poetic and surreal visuals. Some of the more horrifying acts committed by the characters are made sensible and believable simply through the near-objective use of the camera.But the movie isn't all disturbing and painful, it's also warmly humanistic. The characters in the village all find ways of revealing their love and compassion to their fellow townspeople in some way or the other, most especially in the lengthy final sequence where Tatsuhei takes Orin up the mountain. This sequence has the justification of being given the title because of the characters striving to gain their own cultural Mount Olympus. And, as is shown quite graphically, not everyone succeeds at getting there. It takes enormous will and compassion, as well as passion and destruction, to survive in the world.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gratuitous Displays of Senseless Brutality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an odd movie in which scenes of natural predation are pretentiously interspersed between innocuous, routine events, serving as thematic signposts that attempt to define and legitimize the director's morbid fascination with senseless brutality. The disheveled, unkempt, often filthy characters never gain our sympathy. Even those who come closest ultimately become immersed in the brutality of the story. The kindly grandmother casually tricks her youngest son's pregnant paramour into spending the night with a thieving family whom she knows are about to be executed by the murderous villagers. Her strong-willed son, the only person who briefly displays any palpable sentiment, participates in the execution with little concern even for the grandchild that will never be born. The victims aren't merely killed but captured in nets, thrown in a hole, and buried alive, a brutal twist to the supposed necessity of the horrible collective deed. Later, the healthy grandmother bashes her front teeth out so she'll look the part when it's her time to "go to the mountain." All through the movie, this "final journey" is alluded to as if going off to die on a mountainside up in the clouds, a place of ethereal beauty, is somehow a sacrifice fraught with spiritual significance. Unfortunately, the place where the old people are carried is nothing more than a grotesque, stinking bone yard full of broken skeletons and decomposing bodies, serviced by a flock of fat, greedy crows that pick at the dead and impatiently await their next meal. After hauling his mom up the mountain on a pack-board, the strong son simply leaves her there because she insists once again that is how it must be. Before leaving, he sees his selfish neighbor dropping off his troublesome, disabled father, kicking the terrified old man over a cliff while yelling, "Dad, go to the mountain!" The poor, senile old man, trussed up in a net, goes tumbling down the rocks like a cartwheel, bashing his brains out on the way down. This depressing story is supposed to uplift us? This is "beautiful? It's a real comment on the emptiness of our times that so many here would even begin to believe that. I'm skeptical of the notion that this film was based on fact. It comes off like an exercise in racist propaganda. I may be wrong but I think it doubtful that even primitive and isolated Japanese peasants were that uncaring and brutal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad? How we can give an opinion about a Japanese film without knowing their cultural background? As I already said in my opinions about films out of the US, there is a fundamental lack of history about nations, languages, women and man. How is this possible? Such a lack ? I don't known, but I think the US intellectual people has to understand that not only the US exists in this world. By the way I love your culture and I would not give the impression that I am saying something badly about your people. But the lack in appreciating other cultures is astonishing! Why, for gods sake! Why always like it looks the supremacy of one culture over an other? The ballad of Narayama is just the opposite. Let's talk about the export of pornography out of the US?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vicious, Nasty, Brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many glorious, wonderful movies celebrating the courage, honor and spirit of the Japanese peasant in the face of overwhelming adversity. This is not one of them. Where to begin. Well, at the beginning, where we are treated to the bloated body of a dead child, left by its parents to rot in a rice paddy. This is followed by multiple variations on the same theme: patricide, matricide, and further infanticide. At least two innocent children are buried alive. Daughters are raised to be sold into slavery. There is a little self-mutilation. Add in some gleeful animal cruelty - beating a horse and bestiality with a dog, the latter intended as comic relief. The "wise" old matriarch of the central family intentionally, by trickery and without a shred of remorse, causes the murder of one son's pregnant "wife." This is a masterpiece? This depravity won the Palme d'Or? And don't tell me "You just don't understand." I understand it completely. I "get" it. One commenter states "See, feel, don't judge." Are you kidding me? I saw it and I felt ashamed. I will grant that the acting job by Ken Ogata as the eldest son was terrific. His was the only character with an iota of conscience. And yes, the mountains and the snow were beautiful during the main title sequence and at the conclusion. However, they amounted to nothing more than fancy bookends for two hours of inhumanity and cruelty. No thanks. Give me Messrs. Ozu and Mizoguchi. Please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very boring "masterpiece".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating movies has always been a highly subjective procedure. I mean, "The Ballad of Narayama" would get only a *1/2 rating from me for being a grueling, extremely boring, completely unengaging experience, but there are undoubtedly many people that would consider this a masterpiece. Judge for yourself. It does have some memorable/shocking images that you're not likely to have seen before (they shouldn't be revealed here - just to get an idea, we see two snakes making love)....but isn't it a huge problem when we can't even tell the characters apart?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a creepy, muddled, sadistic film. Just the idea of you needing to hitch your parent when he/she turns 70 to some god forsaken mountain where crows come and eat you while you wither up and die. Now that's just the summary. There is a ton of pointless sex, and the plot never is sturdy. It tends to jump around a lot. The photography is great, but that's it. Some may like it, I don't know how. An at least decent film by the same director to rent is "Black Rain" (not Michael Douglas).</fullReview>
