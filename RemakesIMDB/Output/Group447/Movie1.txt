		<shortDescription>One of the most enjoyable movies in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly got swept up in the story and the characters. It was wonderful seeing an adult movie without all the foul language that seems to overwhelm Hollywood at the moment. The acting was just perfect from everyone. I would watch this movie over and over again. Of course I like to eat and the food scenes reminded me of watching Emeril Live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice little movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Better than the ordinary Hollywood movie, this family comedy does a very nice job of presenting a variety of characters in the throes of pursuing their own version of the American Dream. That the family is Mexican-American adds a welcome difference. The camera loves the food being prepared, the Latin-flavored music score enlivens the proceedings, and the acting is quite serviceable. Jacqueline Obrador and Elizabeth Pena shine as the older daughters in the family, the always-reliable Hector Elizondo is fine in a rare leading role. Of greatest interest, however, may be Raquel Welch, playing her age and her ethnicity for the first time in my memory. It is her role, not her performance, that mars the movie. She is a caricature of an older-middle-aged unattached woman, the butt of unkind jokes. And it is the unwitting bias toward the older woman character that undermines the otherwise upbeat, happy ending intended. Still, this one's worth the cost of a rental. Not great art but at least it doesn't insult the viewers' intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. We had wanted to see this when it first came to video/DVD but didn't get to it. Frankly, I then forgot about it. Last week, I was reminded of the movie and went out and rented it.I have not seen the Ang Lee movie, "Eat, Drink, Man, Woman" so can not comment on how it compares. But we really liked "Tortilla Soup" The performance by the cast of Elizondo, Pena, Obradors and unknown (to me) Mello; was very good. Raquel Welch was a bit over the top, but all in good fun. The interaction between the father (Elizondo) and daughters was believable and you could sense the love he had for them under his stern exterior (and you knew his daughters knew it too).As others have mentioned, the food preparation and serving scenes were colorful and very beautiful. Shows there is a lot more to Mexican cuisine than what you run into at most restaurants.This movie will make you smile, like enjoying a good meal. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has a wonderful plot. The father of grown daughters suffers the generational clash and cultural clash of old vs. new. This is an hispanic (but English language)remake of the Chinese film "Eat Drink, Man, Women". Both show the writing credits of Ang Lee. This falls far short of the original.I saw "Eat, Drink..." a few years ago. Although, my wife tends to dislike subtitled movies, she tolerated this one for me. We both loved it. It was well written, directed and acted. "Tortilla Soup" is an ok movie, but failed to keep my attention in the same way that "Eat, Drink..." did. The acting was OK. The direction seemed ok as well. I can't put my finger on why, exactly, but this movie just isn't as good.Unless you absolutely refuse to view subtitled movies, definitely forego this in favor of "Eat, Drink, Man, Women".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake of Eat Drink Man &amp; Woman, both are excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an exact almost word for word copy of Eat Drink Man Woman, a 1994 Twainese production. Both movies are great, but Tortilla soup looses points for lack of originality. Both movies offer sharp portrayals of their various cuisines, and your preference may be Mexican vs.Chinese, however if you can tolerate the fast pace Chinese dialog (subtitles), see the original first. I also preferred the scenery of the original (Eat Drink Man Woman), but perhaps that is because Taiwan is the orient and the architecture is spectacular.Finally, both movies are well acted although the lifestyle portrayed in the story line may be somewhat more believable in the Southern California setting of Tortilla Soup.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, well, it's hard to describe this film. Sometimes you always feel good when you're watching a film. I don't know exactly the reason. I just know that in some occasions you fell not so good because of the events that occur in one film. Here it's about feeling good.It's very comforting to see Hector Elizondo here. I have always liked him. And I have never thought of his acting qualities, or evaluated him as an actor, I just have always had fun watching him on screen. This movie is no exception. I gotta give him the fact that he actually looks like a cook (chef). He actually seems to enjoy the meals he prepares daily. And also seems his family, people who love him. And there wouldn't be much a film without this love.Martin's (Elizondo) three daughters are the center of the film, of course, including their dad. Tamara Bello is beautiful. It's the first time I see her in a movie, but there's such charm in her face, and she makes Maribel the kind of girl some teenagers may identify with.Leticia (Pe?a) is also some kind of misteryous, but understandable. We get her situation, and maybe know there's no way out. But we are also by her side, when she has the time to improve. She has kept his feelings for too long, as if she was obliged to, and know she's desperate to let them go.Carmen (Obradors) might be the opposite. She has let her feelings go, but has kept some of them inside also. It is like she knows she must take some decisions, and she takes them, only she may not be so sure, she may just think she is.The rest of the actors are perfect choices, and make each of the characters they play another part of this charming film.I'm hungry...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly recommend "Tortilla Soup" to anyone that is a fan of great films. Hector Elizondo is perfect as the veteran chef who has to accept that his three grown daughters are finally moving on with their lives. The cast runs smoothly throughout the whole movie, and by the time it ends you feel better about life. It is a very up-lifting and feel-good movie, and I think it is perfect to anyone that either needs that or wants that in their life. Enjoy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Years, I Put off seeing SOUP Because It Was a Remake of EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN. Big Mistake, That!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.......................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FLWhen Maribel (Tamara Mello) learns her Brazilian boyfriend Andy (Nikolai Kinski) speaks 5 languages. She's duly impressed. She zings a question: "What do you call a person who speaks several languages?" He quickly responds: "A polyglot?"..."OK," She continues, "and a person who speaks 2 languages?"..."Ahhh, BEE-lingual?" He says, flubbing the pronunciation. Her final question: "And what about a person who speaks only ONE Language?" "Ahhhhh" He pauses, prompting her to answer her own rhetorical question/cultural joke: "?An American!" In a way, this joke almost sums up the movie. Those of you who are fluent in 2 or more languages, will probably get it. Many of you who are MONO-lingual might shrug your shoulders, smirk, and simply say..."Yeah, So WHAT?!?" For years, I have put off seeing SOUP because it was a remake of EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN. Big mistake, that! Now just because I've rated this 9* (vs.8.5* for EAT DRINK) doesn't mean I expect most of you to rate it 8* or higher! Look, SOUP takes place in L.A., where I grew up. Also, all my life I've been exposed to bilingual/bicultural Hispanic families from many different countries! Certainly, SOUP is far from perfect, but I loved it. WHY? First, I thought Raquel Welch (Birth name: Jo Raquel Tejada, of Bolivian/Irish parents) was absolutely hilarious. What a talented comedienne?What uncanny timing and delivery! Such a tragedy she isn't offered more juicy roles, like this one.She was 60 years old when this was made! WOW! BTW-You wouldn't happen to have her phone number, would you? Interesting Wikipedia fact: Welch was the last star created under the star system! Well integrated cast (no pun intended) delivering a delightful ensemble performance. Hector Elizondo's Spanish, oddly enough, was slightly off and belied the fact that his character was an immigrant, but his nuanced performance made that easy to overlook. WARNING: Don't watch this movie with an appetite! It would be torture?9*STARS*...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!

		<shortDescription>Interesting and entertaining family drama with the chef father as the central character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed on Netflix streaming video.Hector Elizondo is Martin Naranjo, superb chef for Mexican food, not the type we get from the inexpensive corner Mexican restaurants all over Texas, but real gourmet Mexican food. He has been a widow for 15 years and raising 3 daughters in the Los Angeles area.Martin is a traditionalist. Every Sunday he cooks a gourmet dinner for his family, and they use the setting for family conversation. It seems recently that each Sunday dinner is accompanied by a big surprise. The youngest daughter may not want to go to college right away, instead taking a year off "to find herself." Daughter number two is considering taking a great opportunity in Barcelona. The oldest, a teacher, finds a new boyfriend, the baseball coach at school.The daughters are Jacqueline Obradors as Carmen, Tamara Mello as Maribel, and Elizabeth Pe?a as Leticia. Adding spice is Raquel Welch as Hortensia, the single mother of a family friend and who has her eye on Martin.Good movie, explores family dynamics and each member "finding themselves."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoy while the soup's hot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies just make you feel good. 'Tortilla Soup' is certainly one of those.It is the story of a widowed master chef living with his three grown daughters (The premise made me think of the classic Charles Laughton film 'Hobson's Choice.') A fun film, with good dialogue, a sparkling cast and a sweet spirit, it is both hilarious and touching.Hector Elzondo plays Martin Naranjo, a master chef who has lost most of his sense of smell and taste. (I'm still not sure if he still owns his restaurant, or if he now only helps out there.) He is still living with his daughters, who appear to range in age from about 18 to 30.Leticia (Elizabeth Pena) is the oldest, an old-maid chemistry teacher who is devoutly devoted to God, her dad and her teaching. Carmen (Jacqueline Obradors) is the middle daughter, who loves to cook, but whom her father has pressed to get an MBA and pursue a career in big business. Maribel (Tamara Mello) has apparently just graduated from high school and is expected to start college soon.The family is wonderful together. Martin insists on family dinners being respected. He prepares huge restraint-style Mexican meals and expects everyone to be on time and pleasant. With three women under one roof for too many years, though, that isn't often possible.As the story progresses, everyone finds romance, including Martin. The sisters are fantastic together and each one is fun to watch individually. Stand-up comic Paul Rodriguez is perfect as the high school baseball coach who steals Letty's heart, while Nikolai Kinski is very good as Maribel's Brazilian heartthrob. Former bombshell Raquel Welsh, meanwhile, shows guts at age 60 in playing an over-the-hill near-floozy to perfection. (I am reminded of 1930s love goddess Dorothy Lamour's similar role in 'Donovan's Reef.') Constance Marie, meanwhile, is totally lovable as her daughter Yolando.Director Maria Ripoll, who has only directed a handful of films, showed an amazingly deft touch ? both in the dramatic scenes and especially in the comedic sequences. There are some wonderful moments, including the final dinner together, when Letty and Orlando (Rodriguez) attempt to explain their situation. Elzondo's expression is simply priceless. The same can be said each time he waits to give the 'amen' to Letty's ever-longer blessings before meals.This is another fine little film that went under the radar. Like 'Off the Map,' 'Eulogy,' 'The Shipping News,' 'An Unfinished Life' and a handful of other little-seen gems of the past decade, this is a delight for anyone who stumbles across it. I recommend at least one large helping of 'Tortilla Soup.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never saw the original (was that a good thing?).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Hector Elizondo ever since I saw him in "Pretty Woman" and this movie is definitely no exception.All right, I admit it. I like "chick flicks" and I'm not afraid to admit it. I can sit in front of this computer and glance at the television screen each time the scene changes and not have to look back. This is one of those films, but when Elizondo gets to cooking, all I can do is sit there and stare in envy at some of the things he can do with food. As much as he's succeeded with his profession in the kitchen, he sort of feel likes he's failed in the family department; not so much because any of his three daughters have failed at anything (quite the contrary), but because he feels like he's failed in teaching his family heritage to them and its values. He also feels pride in his work as a very accomplished chef, even though, as we find out early on, he's lost his sense of taste.Change happens in all families, and this family is no exception, but, as with everything else, change either brings us closer together in trying to overcome different adversities and obstacles, or drives us further apart. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wonders about their values and where they should be going in life.9 out of 10 stars!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Soup Has A Zesty Taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tortilla Soup is a Mexican-American remake of Ang Lee's earlier Eat Drink Man Woman. Hector Elizondo stars as a family patriarch facing a late life crisis, living with three adult daughters: Elizabeth Pena, Jacqueline Obradors, and Tamara Mello. Each daughter has her own interpersonal crisis to face as well: Being socially withdrawn, trying to please one's parent instead of one's self, and trying to find one's identity distinct from one's family. Mexican cuisine is at the center of the comedy/drama prepared by Elizondo's chef character for each Sunday dinner. At each gathering, a different person expresses proposals to the others present as solutions to their dilemmas. Throw a sizzling, marriage-minded widow into the mix, played by Raquel Welch, and stir with her adult daughter (Constance Marie) who is a single mother and the soup is just right. The script is somewhat weak and formulaic because this is simply a remake, but the actors all shine and make the most of the material, especially Elizabeth Pena (as a withdrawn schoolteacher) and Paul Rodriguez (as a high school coach). The cinematography is sumptuous, especially the food scenes; the colors are reminiscent of Mexican culture. The music is wonderfully lively with ethnic flavoring, especially the very famous Spanish song "Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps". *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best performance by Hector Elizondo! All of the cast was excellent. I found the movie to be very moving and witty. I never saw the original version but the adaptation is just great. To me this is one of the all time great movies, it brings you along with the sentiments of the family. The cooking scenes are excellent! The story is fantastic! There are some twists and turns that help the movie along, I would rather not give away the ending nor too much information so I won't reveal too much. I would say that as a Hispanic this movie just blew me away and as a single father of four girls with two at home, I can relate to it just fine. The credits say that the song is sung by Doris Day and it may be but for the credits, I just have to believe that it is not her!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A father with three very different kind of daughters, the food that binds the family together...what more can you ask for in this movie?Though Mexican-American Martin has lost his sense of taste, he always manages to whip up great Mexican dinner for his three single daughters. The eldest - a career-minded woman, the middle child - a teacher and the youngest - still a student. The three daughters have always wanted to find their real purpose in life, outside of the family's circles. This is where the clashes occurred, especially between the youngest one and the father.While the girls tried to find their real identity, their father is also seeking out another woman in his life since his wife passed away years ago.And they all much later realised that there's more than it meets the eye in terms of family ties.I had actually no idea that this is a remake of Ang Lee's 'Eat Drink Man Woman' till I saw the opening credits. I had never seen that one yet though. Anyhow, this movie is just beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming Latinization of Ang Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tortilla Soup" is a Chicano adaptation of Ang Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman" and I enjoyed it just as much if not more, partly because it was nice to see Latino actors and actresses playing Latinos, as they don't always get to do, such as Hector Elizondo, and because they really felt like a family. In the Lee original, I felt the patriarch's gorgeous home meal preparation was the same as his restaurant work, while here I got much more of a sense of a family gathering and eating, as in "What's Cooking."The family announcements at each meal accentuate that eating at home with a parent isn't just an aesthetic experience, but a psychological and sociological one. The audience, including me, really got into the three sisters' romantic and housekeeping travails, with each making their own way in a realistic world, yet reflecting their father's upbringing, each in her sexy own way.Latino and Brazilian music is beautifully used to reflect each family member's romance and the sisters together. But the credits didn't really answer if Elizondo had a stunt double for all that deft slicing and dicing. (originally written 9/9/2001)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the neverending search for grist for the mill of evening video entertainment for me and my sweet wife, I was pleased to find this (to me) obscure title. The cast is sound, the performances believable and enjoyable, and the plot gentle and real-life.The food scenes still swim before my vision: sheesh, I'm not a gourmand but this movie really makes food spectacular! Just watching Hector (or his 'stunt' double!) cook is a passion-evoking experience. Like seeing any master craftsperson doing what s/he loves, it is delightful. Racquel is really charming and plays a memorably wacky character.As a lover of reality shows (mostly), I think of this as one of the genre of movies most like a reality show: a grown-up evening's watch. The plotting means you'll have some closure after the 90-120 minutes, and the characters and situations are real enough that you can just sit back and have a good time watching these folks live out their interesting lives.Did I mention the FOOD? :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry, folks: I cannot seem to get past the lack in "Tortilla Soup" of the strong passion that was apparent in this film's original incarnation: "Eat Drink Man Woman." The original is best. It has more depth to characters, more turmoil and often more depressing themes where love triumphs nevertheless. Tortilla Soup is manipulated to be more mainstream American and lighter hearted. It's ok, it just doesn't carry the same profound messages that "Eat Drink.." brought to the screen. I suggest that, if this is the only incarnation of this story that you have seen and you liked it, you would be doing yourself a favor to see Ang Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman." It's got more soul!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living as we do in Australia this movie was totally unknown to us before I borrowed it at the video shop yesterday and watched it tonight. My wife and I loved it completely from the opening with Hector Elizondo preparing a meal for his family to the ending with the preparation of another meal-bookends for a brilliant film.The movie was about family and people coming together and maneuvering around the family problems that will be immediately recognized by any viewer.I was struck by the fact that this was a female look at family life and not the traditional male slant on everything which is the general rule out of Hollywood-this emphasis gave the movie an extraordinary refreshing appeal.This fact along with the wonderful shot selection by the director, Maria Ripoll, of the many cooking sequences made for a marvelously enticing film.The director formed a wonderfully sensitive examination of a crucial time in the lives of this wonderful family and I highly recommend Tortilla Soup to all movie lovers-action thriller it's not, thoughtful and richly satisfying it is.</fullReview>

A great deal of attention is paid to accents in Spanish. For a Basque-Puertoriqueno , ELizondo's Mexican accent is absolutely believable, as is the Cuban accent of Julio Mechoso. Only one linguistic error occurs. In "daughter" Carmen's (Jacqueline Obradors) planned move to Barcelona, she says that she already speaks the language. She doesn't, because Spanish is not the official---nor the legal---language in Barcelona: it is Catalan (a Provencal Language, seemingly half-French and half-Spanish). But that's a minor point. Raquel Welch is wonderful as the woman pursuing Elizondo. This is a wholly believable film, and wonderful entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good movie, but not quite up to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original movie was, I think, better, but this is still quite entertaining. The cast is very solid, and it was nice to see Raquel Welch playing an Hispanic, but she's such a babe that the character wasn't quite as funny as in "Eat, Drink, Man, Woman". I was a little disappointed that the DVD didn't have a commentary track. I've seen a couple of interviews of Hector Elizondo, and he's a very interesting guy, so I was hoping to listen to him talk about the movie.As in the original the food is amazing, but somehow it just made me hungry this time. In "Eat, Drink, Man, Woman" the food is so elaborate and there is so much of it that it is comic...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only is delectable food savoring in the backdrop of this comedy, so are wanted desires.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A widowed man successfully raises three daughters while owning and being master chef at an elegant Mexican restaurant. After the death of his wife (over a decade ago) he not only lost his zest for life but his sense of taste and smell. Despite this he still manages to maintain control of his restaurant, prepare mouth-watering gourmet meals for his daughters and skillfully control his household. While their lives appear to be running smoothly things begin to unravel. The daughters who were once so willing and permissible to dad's control are developing the need for independence and the urge to experience life. All of them struggle with cultural customs that discourage independence and self-fulfillment. So not only is delectable food savoring in the backdrop of this comedy, so are wanted desires.While the youngest daughter is trying to insert her independence; the oldest is on a crusade for sainthood (her way of deterring love), and the middle one is oozing with intelligence and is being forced into a life she doesn't want. The daughters are forced to take charge of their lives when fate takes over. This leaves the father having to make a decision about his own needs. He can remain in the house alone or begin a new life. It's not until he releases control of his Daughters lives that he is able to regain his own, finding love and his sense of taste and smell.) In the end they all learn a very valuable lesson, the importance of pursuing desires of the heart. This is truly an enjoyable and collectable movie. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tortilla Soup Leave Moviegoers Hungry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've got to wonder about a film that pitches its food as the star. Not that the dishes, prepared by the `Too Hot Tamales' Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, fall short of expectations. Tortilla Soup is rife with cooking and dinner scenes that feature both classic Mexican and Mexican fusion dishes. But nobody eats film, so the magnitude of the food's presen ce distracts from the story line. Or maybe the story line distracts from the story line.Lying beneath it all, is a story about a family of Mexican-Americans and their abruptly changing lives. Hector Elizondo (Chicago Hope) is Martin Naranjo, a semi-retired chef and the father of three young women. Every Sunday his three daughters are required to join him for a grand meal, which he spends the day preparing. His eldest daughter Leticia, played by Elizabeth Pena, is a devout Christian and a schoolteacher. She's the daddy's girl. The middle child Carmen (Jacqueline Obradors) is a successful executive, with an eccentric style of cooking that aggravates her father. The youngest daughter Maribel (Tamara Mello, She's All That) is a fun loving high school student that longs to see the world. Soon Leticia starts receiving love letters, Carmen gets offered a job in Barcelona, and Maribel decides to run off with her new boyfriend. Nothing is as it once was. People begin to miss Sunday dinner, which aggravates Martin, whose taste is dead and health may be failing. Martin decides to fill his new free time with the courtship of the mother of a family friend. Hortensia (Raquel Welch) seeks Martin as her fourth husband.The dining scenes are extensive, acting as segues into the major conversations in the film. The cooking scenes battle the dialogue for time on the screen. The soundtrack, most audible when food is either being prepared or being eaten, turns out to be the hidden star of Tortilla Soup. It's light Latino fare, showcasing `Si En Un Final' by Eliades Ochoa of the Buena Vista Social Club and a Spanglish version of `Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps,' by Lila Downs. It's a warm fuzzy moment when the girls sing a song together during post-dinner KP duty. That's what sisterhood is all about. It's about the love, the support, and the cleaning.Everything seems to work out for the characters, as they often do in movies. I'm not going to give anything away, but I will say that it involves both `living happily' and `forever after.' There's a twist, which the written documents sponsored by the film all boast as unpredictable, and this can be attributed to its lack of support throughout the film. The cast, despite a high level of talent, fails to perk up dialogue that teeters on the edge of cheesy. In one scene, Leticia and Carmen discuss their father's disdain for Christianity. Martin, a Catholic, feels that Christians worship Christ, rather than Christianity as a whole. Carmen mentions that Christ was a Christian, and both girls are surprised when the hairdresser reminds them that Christ was a Jew. Wouldn't the `devout' Leticia have known that?One of the more tactfully placed cultural snippets is the persistent use of Spanglish, the Spanish/English hybrid, which Martin shuns. His demands for either English or Spanish to be spoken in his household serves the character well, reinforcing the juxtaposition of Martin's loyalty to tradition and his Americanization of the daughters. A great deal of Tortilla Soup seeks to enrich the audience with factual knowledge about Hispanic culture and religion, but most of it is presented it so conspicuously as to make it appear forced and excessive.The film's saving grace is the relationships between the characters. While the characters as individuals are peppered with stereotyping, the entire Naranjo family and their friends blend together nicely. Through thick and thin, sisters are sisters, and offer each other unwavering support. Their father, who struggles with his own faults, seeks to find the line between helping and suffocating his children. As his family changes, so must he, and for a man seeped in tradition, change comes slowly. Martin is aided through this transition by the hand of a young girl, a daughter of a friend, whom he visits at school daily to bring a home cooked lunch. The young girl quells Martin's empty nest syndrome and also plays a roll in the `surprise' ending. And that's the best hint you'll get the whole movie.It's difficult to say whom Tortilla Soup was written for. It's rated PG-13 for sexual content, but it leans toward PG. It's really a family movie, a daytime matinee. Maybe something to do in the afternoon before having a nice sociable dinner. Then again, the food in the film looks so good, dinner will probably be a disappointment. Directed by Maria Ripoll. 102 Min. Rated PG-13.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other then one bad rating, I can't believe that anyone could dislike this movie. I intend to write an email to IMDB to investigate and make sure there isn't some sort of mistake here. Usually the ratings are more accurate then this.I would also like to compliment the rest of the reviews which seem to be getting not only better, more accurate. Maybe we are all becoming better afficinados as well as writers!Now on to my take!Being a fan of Eat Drink Man and Woman, I was lagging inspiration to go see "just" another remake, but in truth I was quite taken by how great this movie works. I'm sure it has a lot to do with the fact I live and grew up in the Los Angeles area and how well the mvie portrays the characters as well as the food! This being as my best friends own a certain LA famoso Mexican eatery and whose lives are just as interesting as eccentric as these characters in this movie.How great it is to go see a movie that not only entertains, but must have had a reasonable for Hollywood standards--budget that was spent entirely on food! Just delicious looking stuff!As far as acting, it is a delight to see the talented Hector Elizondo finally get his due. Forget the silly awards that only showcase commercial viability. Hector surpasses them here quite nicely.As someone accurately measured, it is nice to see Raquel Welch in a role that was perfectly cast for her both visually and in character with her natural persona.Now on to the real fun stuff!Jaquline Obradors, Elizabeth Pena, and Tamara Mello are just a delight to see on screen. What happens here is a spacing of characters to cover diverse generations. Pena's character, obviously a child born in the 60's, Obradors' from the 70's and Mello's of the 80's. Despite the flaws and eccentrics of each of their characters, they still are the family unit, even going to the length of still residing at home despite there differing lives. The greatness here is the depiction of a well-rounded family despite all of the minute flaws that really do enjoy one another. (LOVE!)What a great change from the head bashing action movies that seem to be green-lighted from anyone wanting to make a profit. The movie has a character and a class that just like it's predecessor maintains a decency about modern film-making, and that it isn't all smoke, mirrors and computer graphics.You will all have to excuse me now, I have to go eat!(Yes, I just did return from seeing this movie!)</fullReview>

This was just too sickening to stomach. Filled with bad acting, trite dialog, two-dimensional characters, and sometimes-amateurish cinematography and film editing. Examples: A kitchen quarrel amongst the sisters is resolved by playfully breaking dishes on the floor and the three singing and dancing over the shards arm in arm. Just too cute. A character demonstrates her zest for life by standing up in a sports car with the wind blowing in her hair and squealing, "Woo-hoo-o-o-o-o!" Just too trite. And not only did I walk out after 50 minutes, but it was my wife (a "chick-flick" aficionado) who suggested we get out of the theater before she became physically ill from this turkey grande.</fullReview>

Maybe the lack of fowl language and raw scenes of violence and sex turned them off. But, if you want to see the insides of a family in transition, done well, this is the movie.

		<shortDescription>Hispanic re-telling of Ang Lee's kitchen-based comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tortilla Soup" does a wonderful job translating Ang Lee's romantic comedy "Eat Drink Man Woman" from China to a Hispanic community in the U.S. It retells the story fairly closely, retaining many of the scenes from the original (though it does drop one story-line completely, which improves the flow of the film a great deal). In fact, most of the changes made to the movie improve on the original, and while original films are almost always more appealing than their descendants, I preferred "Tortilla Soup" in almost every way (the movie misses the pristine visual composition of the original, but this is a small tradeoff, and more than made up for by the handsome production design). It's often said that comedy is much more difficult to translate than drama, but a movie as enjoyable as "Tortilla Soup" doesn't need to justify it's existence as a remake. The cast is filled with actors that have proven their capability time and time again, and they interact here with a low-key assurance that radiates throughout the production and fills the screen with warmth and festive good spirit.Standing out from the rest of the excellent cast is Hector Elizondo, whose portrayal of a man whose life consists, in about equal measures, of running the kitchen of a highly successful restaurant and the lives of his three daughters. Mr. Elizondo projects calm, complete authority in every scene he is in; even in the cooking scenes, he moves through the kitchen, handles the food, checks the army of bubbling pots with the assurance of the master chef. Throughout his career, Mr. Elizondo has combined his dignified appearance with a precise comic timing that has led to many scene-stealing supporting roles as a slow-burning straight man. Between his perfectly manicured goatee and his gleaming bald head, he has given his characters a look that simultaneously penetrates his co-actors and twinkles just enough to let the audiences members know that he is not just in on the joke, but knows it better than the stars themselves. In this movie, he is the star, and it is wonderful to see him use that cultivated persona in new and enriching ways. He finds perfect credibility as a man who uses the strength of his will to make food transform itself according to his wishes, and yet finds himself baffled when the same approach fails with his daughters.The movie itself finds comic moments throughout based on the confusion generated when men and women try to interact with each other and the inability of one side to understand how the other works. Fortunately, though, they do (work, that is), and it's a relief to see a comedy that's equally as perceptive of both men and women, and while the plot of the film hinges on the clashes between the members of the family, the characters themselves remain wholly, delightfully functional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tasty Movie with Soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that I did not understand a lot in Eat Drink Man Woman, I am not familiar with life in Taipei, but I am familiar with life of Mexican's. That is one of the reason Tortilla Soup is so good, it takes Ang Lee's script and keeps the soul but adds some spice. The cast of Tortilla Soup is souper (I mean super): The elegant Hector Elizondo plays the hardworking single father of three independent girls; he is stern father with his girls but shows a softer side with the 10-year-old daughter of a cute neighbor played by the sexy Constance Marie. Plus he is one hell of a cook. Elizabeth Pe?a plays the overly religious older daughter Leticia, she tries to hide and hold down her passion but a handsome baseball coach, played by Paul Rodriguez, brings out the love in her. The other two daughters are played by Jacqueline Obradors, as the second eldest Carmen, who has her life mapped out by her father but she does not need a map. Tamara Mello as the sickly thin baby of the family Maribel who is ignored by her family and almost everyone else. Tortilla is great fun and has lots of heart, but has a soul to match. The surprises in this movie will make you laugh and smile days after the movie is over. A tasty 8 out of 10</fullReview>

Mello is so cute I could puke, Welch is silly, Obradors is just another pretty face talking like a smart person, and the only distaff who nailed her role (as usual) was Pena.

		<fullReview>Tortilla soup is all about family and food (dinner) and how each really draws inspiration from the other. The food is the hub from which the drama, and the laughs, turn. Three daughters, each at different phases of their lives, are torn between their home lives ruled by their stern but loving father and the outside world. Dad, a chef, spoils them with some of the best nuevo spanish cuisine any latina daughter could ever possibly hope for, and has instilled in each an appreciation of food, and life. Dad is single, realizes he is about to lose the core of his family one by one and food is all he has, or so he thinks. Just when you think he'll be alone to cook for himself, surprises come in spades. And, as always, it's the food that draws them all back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I greatly enjoyed Eat, Drink, Man, Woman. I found Tortilla Soup a failed attempt to adapt this film to a different audience. First off, I think the plot development is hinged on the relationship between the father and the daughters. However, it is important to note that this dynamic that drives the conflict and action is not so easily found in Latin-American culture as it has been (re)established in LA. With the Asian family in Asia, the father-dauthers dynamic was on the money. The new cultural paradigm for Tortilla Soup simply lacks that essential element. From this, the development of the film is beyond the realm of belief. Adding to my disappointment, was the discovery that the scripts for Eat, Drink, Man, Woman and Tortilla Soup are practically identical. The variations are few and far between, and I think the duo that put in such hard work scripting this film should have stuck to their Asian success.</fullReview>

Gives a good number of enjoyable moments and sweet natured performances to pass the time nicely, althought it often also skims a little too much on the comedy/drama line.

		<shortDescription>Cliched rip-off of earlier movies in the genre. Poorly executed, amateurish work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tortilla Soup" tries hard to be a better movie. It has assembled many of the elements needed for that: Great cast, good settings, fine POTENTIAL topic area. Despite the promising beginnings, this flick falls flat. The writing includes so many wooden cliches and tired old tropes that the movie comes off as something a very talented 16 year-old girl (with access to a Hollywood studio) would produce.Several times during the DVD viewing I thought I recognized the movie: Was it that I HAD indeed seen before, but had simply forgotten about it? That does happen, of course. I'd see some scene or other and then think, "Oh--- I saw this 5 or 8 years ago, and the new DVD is merely a re-issue of that older movie." Wrong! I had not seen it, I finally figured out. The release date is 2001, and my memory isn't THAT bad. Those moments of DVD deja vu and recollected story simply show how cliched this movie really is. The movie's writer and/or director somehow managed to include passages from many past flicks of the genre. A more rigorous and careful script review and production plan would have caught those gaffes. But this movie, again, has the amateurish feel of a bright child's first effort, so the gaffes would have been understood coming from a high school student, but not from a supposed adult professional.The themes of family, belonging, growing up and moving out, deciding on a future, etc. deserved more care and skill in their depiction. The truly wonderful cast deserved more. The paying audience deserved more. As a "one shot" TV movie that appears one night, gets a possible rerun a few months later, and then disappears forever--- "Tortilla Soup" might have been adequate. But one would think the producers would have known better than to make a corny, derivative, and cliched movie into a "permanent" DVD release.</fullReview>

(Dir: Maria Ripoll)Hector Elizondo is one of those actors you love to see showing up onscreen no matter what the film or show is about because he's always interesting to watch. He's a character actor who've you've seen countless times before and I'm sure you'll agree as well that no matter what it is he's in, you've enjoyed his work. Until now Elizondo has made a serviceable, Yeoman-like career as an actor primarily appearing in practically all of Garry Marshall's projects (he's best known as the father-figure hotel manager to Julia Roberts' Cinderella prostitute in "Pretty Woman" and his Emmy-winning turn on the David E. Kelley tv drama "Chicago Hope"). Finally here is a film where he gets to headline and allow his gift truly flow. Cast as the paterfamilias Martin Naranjo, a vastly talented chef, with a brood of three grown up daughters all driving him crazy despite his deeply felt love for his family even as they are becoming more and more independent. His youngest, Maribel (Mello) is a free-spirited type (here two-toned hair a dead giveway to rebellion) who works as a record store cashier and desires something ? anything ? to give her life direction and meaning; his middle daughter Carmen (Obradors) is a pretty, sexually active, successful businesswoman facing a new challenge in a possible job venture in Europe and his eldest ? and perhaps most troubled ? Leticia (Pena in one of her finest roles) ? a school teacher whose only solace is church and her future teetering on spinsterhood. To make things even more interesting Martin's sense of taste and smell has been impaired (apparently he hasn't been the same since his wife passed some years back; an apt metaphor for his life in transition as well) and relying on his best friend and old restaurant partner Gomez (equally wonderful character actor Mechoso, who gives the story a nice balance of common sense to the nuttiness ensuing; he anchors Martin nicely) who is busy running their catering establishment to keep things afloat. If that were not enough, Martin's pretty young neighbor Yolanda (the fetching Marie) is in the middle of her divorce and has her sexpot widowed mother Hortensia (the gravity defying, remarkably well-preserved sex bomb Welch having fun here) visiting to help her with her little girl Eden (Herrera) and a reason for Hortensia to visit Martin, hoping he gets her signals straight (she wants him to be her next husband). If all this sounds vaguely familiar it should be. The film is based on Ang Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman" that centered on a Chinese family with the same storyline basically here transplanted as a Latino clan in Los Angeles and the cuisine Mexican. The cast is splendid overall particularly Elizondo commanding with his usual charming gravitas as the center figure to his in flux familia as are Pena as the stoop shouldered, long-suffering sister who finally finds happiness in the form of fellow colleague Rodriguez, the school gym teacher and her realization is a thing of unrefined beauty in her ability to go from newfound bravado to sudden shock and humiliation to jubilation. Perhaps the real star is the mouth-watering meals on display and in particular the meticulous preparation Elizondos' Martin takes whether its for his nightly dinners or a special lunch for Eden, the envy of her classmates in the cafeteria. (The on-camera creations deserve kudos to Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger from the Food Network who do incredible things with the delicious looking apparitions on display).What makes the film such a success is believing the ensemble as the family going through their daily routines and extraordinary occurrences throughout including a death, an impromptu marriage, a sudden departure from the nest and an unexpected (well I wasn't totally shocked but some might be) engagement announcement ? most done at the dinner table or familiar surroundings. The comedy is that all families are a bit eccentric and put to full tests here with one recognizing our foibles and frailties yet laughing along as we overcome them (and the Naranjos too). Alongside subgenre films like "Soul Food", "Big Night" and last year's "What's Cooking?" you're funny bone will be tickled and your taste buds savoring for the post-screening dash to the nearest eatery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable comedy with a bad after-taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scene at the end where Elizondo humiliates the character played by Raquel Welch (Hortensia) is an insult to women. This is an ugly and mean-spirited male-chauvinist-pig movie masquarading as a "liberated" comedy. I hope it doesn't reflect the hispano-american values, although I have to admit that the food looked mightily appetizing. But can I trust what I see or will it leave a bad after taste just like the movie itself???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a pretty screwed up mechanical remaking of ang lee's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i saw this film on star-movie channel accidentally in a boring night,and i have to say that i was totally confused about the meaningless mechanical remaking of ang lee's previous movie,you will never figure out how bloody spoiled the remaking was if you never saw the original one before and in the mean time you are not a Chinese.Tortilla Soup has exactly the same plot with lee's original movie and was pretty much a bad "copy" or "translation",apparently you could merely notice only a few differences between the two versions including cast,languages and locations where the stories taken place etc,but they are not important compared with the losing of the soul which was supposed to be expressed to people!the original movie that was filmed by ang lee was a story about a family in Taipei,and the main idea was to tell people the importance of the family value and also question some of the unhealthy city life styles right there in Taipei from a few aspects.so the plot of that movie was meant to be happened to a specific group of people at a specific time and in a specific place,you know you couldn't just copy it and make the movie replaced with a brand new cast and something else,this is definitely meaningless and stupid even if you liked the plot so much.well i kinda get a good expression to all this stuff,you see it just like you know a person very well and you liked him very much,when someday you found out that the person had become a "walking dead" after taking a plastic surgery,though you could still recognize him.maybe the expression is a little bit weird and creepy,but just that it helps reflect the truth.</fullReview>
