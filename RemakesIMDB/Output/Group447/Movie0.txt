		<shortDescription>Ang Lee Sets The Table Of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A veritable smorgasbord of all the things that make life worthwhile, including good friendship, love, food and sex, can be found in Ang Lee's `Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,' the story of a widower who has raised three daughters on his own, and now that they are grown is ready to move on with his life. Chu (Sihung Lung), a celebrated chef who runs the kitchen of a huge restaurant, finds himself at an impasse however; his daughters, Jia-Jen (Kuei-Mei Yang), the eldest, a teacher, Jia-Chen (Chien-lien Wu), his second, an airline executive, and Jia-Ning (Yu-Wen Wang), the youngest, who works at a fast food restaurant, all still live with their father, and though they are adults (all in their twenties), he feels responsible for them, as they are still under his roof. They, on the other hand, feel responsible for him; he'll soon be retired, and they fear age is catching up with him. And it makes them each, in turn, think twice about career opportunities and any romantic entanglements that may appear on the horizon. it's a situation they all realize is not conducive to a happy, fulfilling and fully functional family life; the love is there, but it's seasoned with frustration, and no one seems to know what to do about it. Lee has crafted and delivered a complex, involving film, laced with poignancy and humor that deals with the kinds of problems most people face during the course of their lives. And, of course, there's the love, the many faces of which are all explored here. Food is the metaphor; Chu sets his table with a variety of tantalizing and exotic offerings, even as the table of life is set with like fare, and once set, it is up to the individual to sample what they will. Fittingly, it is at the dinner table that many of the meaningful events in the lives of the family members are revealed. Working from a screenplay written by Lee, James Schamus and Hui-Ling Wang, Lee uses the intricate emotional weave of the story to optimum effect with his ability to illuminate the sensibilities of his characters, and that he does it so well demonstrates the depth of his own insight into human nature. And that he can so proficiently transfer the emotions of the written page to the screen demonstrates his mastery of the art of film directing. As he proves with this film (as with films like `The Ice Storm' and `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'), he is simply one of the best directors in the business. Lee's unique touch is also felt in the performances he exacts from his actors, a number of which are outstanding in this film, beginning with Lung, who brings Chu so credibly to life. Wang, Wu and Yang are also exemplary in their portrayals of Chu's daughters. To their credit-- as well as Lee's-- there's not a false moment to be found in their performances, all of which stand up to even the closest scrutiny. These are all very real people in a very real setting, which enables the audience to identify and relate to the characters and their story, assuring that connection which makes this film such a satisfying experience. The supporting cast includes Sylvia Chang (Jin-Rong), Winston Chao (Li Kai), Chao-jung Chen (Guo Lun), Lester Chit-Man Chan (Raymond), Yu Chen (Rachel), Jui Wang (Old Wen) and Ah Lei Gua (Madame Ling). As with real life, `Eat, Drink, Man, Woman' is far from predictable, and is filled with twists and turns, including a surprise at the end that equals anything M. Night Shyamalan could come up with. In the final analysis, this film is a delightful, entertaining reflection upon the human condition that will awaken your taste buds and prepare you for the feast of life. And, like life, it is there for the taking; grab it with both hands and embrace it. By the end, you'll be glad you did. I rate this one 10/10.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ang Lee's cinematic banquet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ang Lee has turned what might have been merely an extended Taiwanese soap opera into a wise and warm exploration of family relationships, love and friendship, against the backdrop of a traditional society adapting to the modern world. Fascinating in themselves, the food preparation sequences serve as a metaphor for the skill required to transform bare existence into a rich life (and perhaps also as a metaphor for film making, where similar care and deftness are required). The film focuses on the strained relations between master chef Chu (Sihung Lung) and his three unmarried daughters, and on the relationships of all four in love and at work. These relationships run the gamut from first love to love the second time around; from those based almost solely on sex to those based on none. (Some of the most touching scenes are those between Chu and his older colleague Wen (Jui Wang.))Via the various workplaces Lee subtly shows us the changing face of Taiwanese society. Despite her father's profession, and seemingly with his approval, his youngest daughter works in a fast-food outlet; the eldest has converted to Christianity, and teaches science to boys, who treat her with a mixture of traditional deference and western-style insolence; the middle daughter is a successful airline executive, but only because time-honoured attitudes debarred her, as a woman, from following in her father's footsteps as a cook.Unlike the classic Hollywood film, there is little out-and-out conflict in this movie, which seems to be based more on the Chinese philosophical concept of Yin and Yang, mutually dependent opposites. But whatever its underlying cinematic rationale, it is a masterpiece. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The well-traveled metaphor of food as communication is given a tender, appealing treatment in Ang Lee's finely observed film about a widower whose aging and loneliness have caused him to lose touch with his three grown daughters, each of whom is looking for love in modern-day Taiwan. The father (a gallant Sihung Lung) is a master chef who has begun to lose his sense of taste while attempting to come to grips with his daughters' increasing independence and the failing health of his best friend (Jui Wang); he begins to question the basis of existence, namely love and food. The daughters, meanwhile, feeling cramped by their father's distance, begin to explore notions of freedom from their cramped quarters. Lee is in a positive, sympathetic frame of mind here, articulately exploring the theme of alienation that he would later revisit with a much more gloomy perspective in `The Ice Storm' and though the film holds virtually no surprises, it is a stylistic success, easy to like and moving effortlessly with a superior sense of rhythm; it's always pleasing, even when the content feels overly familiar. He demonstrates a healthy respect for his characters (with the exception of a divorcee whose bitter views of marriage don't stop her from pursuing Lung)--everyone gets to play out their lives with dignity and happiness and without an ounce of filmmaker moralizing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a beautiful and endearing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Taiwanese movie is about the best film I have seen about the generational gap between traditional and modern Chinese cultures. The father in the movie is a widower and a superb cook who has unfortunately begun to lose his sense of taste--needing to have his assistants taste his food to get the flavor right. Much of the movie centers on the love life of him as well as his daughters, as well as the older man's friendship with a cute neighbor girl and her mother.I loved this movie because the material was handled so gently and realistically--making you really care about most of the characters. About the only one you DON'T care for is the obnoxious older lady that has set her sights on Dad! How the many relationships are resolved is masterful and provided me with a good laugh! This is a terrific movie for anyone looking for a slice of life, a movie about world cultures or someone wanting to watch a cute romantic movie. Guys--relax!!! You'll enjoy this one, too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tasting the spice of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is usually nothing that gets me away from my newspapers on a Sunday Morning. I usually spend several hours on my back porch immersed in news and entertainment. I flipped on the TV to see what was happening in the third round of the Masters and I noticed a movie on the Indie channel that I hadn't seen and it looked interesting. Big mistake! It Was And Lee's Yin shi nan nu (Eat Drink Man Woman). The paper got put aside as I couldn't tear my eyes away from the story. It was captivating, to say the least. How a widowed father deals with three daughters was the classic relationship film.In addition, the subplot, how everyone was doing something that they thought was "what was expected," instead of what they really wanted to do was a simple definition of life out of balance. Only when life is in balance can you taste the spice. You'll have to invest some time in watching this great film to understand that fully, and it will be time well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Austen movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I finally got around to seeing this on TV a few nights ago, I had completely forgotten that Ang Lee had been the somewhat unusual (it was thought at the time) choice to direct a well-reviewed remake of Jane Austen's "Sense &amp; Sensibility." But as I watched, it struck me quite forcefully that EDMW was an updated version of an Austen movie, and a very clever one. The marriageable daughters are there, the beleaguered father, the talkative woman--in this case the neighbor with designs on Mr. Chu, and I felt that her somewhat over-the top performance was the most Austenesque of the lot. The treatment throughout is delicate, sophisticated and affectionate, and some of the twists--the religious daughter who has lied about her "past" to make herself seem less pathetic--truly original. Lovely performances, pretty young actresses and a good script. I wish I'd seen it earlier, but I'm grateful to a no-commercial station for putting it on now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a female Asian American (1st generation), I definitely relate to the movie, especially the three daughters' devotion to their father and of maintaining and continuing family tradition. I loved the differences amongst the daughters: The older religious teacher daughter, the power executive daughter, and the teen aged daughter. However, no matter how their lives diverged, they were always brought back to the table by their ever-patient father. The little neighbor girl was absolutely adorable and the relationship between her and the father is endearing. The best scene is when she brings her lunch to school and the food is so lovely, tall of the children crowd around her and she's the hit of lunch period. Besides this movie, other Ang Lee films that are great are The Wedding Banquet and The Ice Storm and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon - need to see Sense and Sensibility and Brokeback Mountain (maybe even the Hulk), but this movie is my all time favorite - it makes me sad and wistful at times, but in the end, it always brings a smile to my face and touches my heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is full of surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a visually sumptuous confection served up by Ang Lee as a follow-up to The Wedding Banquet.While some people may be put off that the film is in Mandarin with subtitles (and the DVD does not have a dubbing option), the film is so strong visually that you forget about the subtitles and just admire the thoroughly delightful story.I found the film's theme very interesting...that life constantly surprises, especially if one opens themselves up to life's possibilities.Nothing in this film plays out like you expect it to. It is the single common thread between the multiple story lines. If this film has a flaw it is that too many of the changes happen too suddenly, without an examination of the processes that led to the sudden developments.The food scenes in this film are to die for. In this case, as opposed to being a primarily carnal sensual experience as it is in films like "Chocolat" and "Like Water For Chocolate," food also takes on a rhythmic intensity and meter here. There is amazing energy and balance displayed in the preparation and presentation of the meal. Sort of like Feng Shui for the tummy.Bon Appetit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my All Time Favorites!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eat, Drink, Man, Woman is one of the best films of all time. It has all the elements of a great movie. From the opening shot to the final I was absolutely riveted to this compelling, truthful, beautiful, and humorous look into the lives of a Taiwanese family. Ang Lee, known quite famously now for "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and the upcoming "Hulk" has done a masterful job of directing and storytelling. The cinematography is INCREDIBLE. The movie as mentioned focuses on on Widower, Master Chef Chu, who is having a hard time relating to his three independent daughters. He attempts to communicate his love for them by creating these incredible gourmet dinners. The daughters are very defined, each with a different personality. The eldest, is a Christian, which is the first time in a movie I have ever seen, where a Christian is portrayed in a favorable light. She is struggling with being an old maid and the fear of leaving her Father uncared for if she does get married. The second daughter is wild and rebellious. She is portrayed extremely well by the ultra sexy Chien Lien Wu. This woman is absolutely stunning!!! She is torn between three things, her career, her desire to be independent, and her liason's with two men, one who is married. The third daughter is portrayed sweetly and innocent who ends up stealing her best friends boyfriend away. There are many plot twists and turns, but in the end, the movie finishes in a beautiful and happy way. I have now watched this movie twenty times and I think it is a great contribution to the film world. I wish more people knew about it here in the States. This movie can move you to being a better person. On a side note, I highly recommend you order some Chinese food, because you will be starving for it before the movie is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving insight into family and tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came across Yin Shi Nan Nu just by chance, when one day I was sorting DVD's in my local store. I was curious about the name in Spanish, and I have seen other movies by Ang Lee, but I have never repented for my sudden decision to take the movie home. This is a brilliant portrait of a family on the verge of being torn apart by their personal differences and the ominous presence of modernity, which has started to undermine the roots of the traditional Taiwanese family life. The presence of traditional Chinese Cuisine, in which Chu is both a master and the heir to hundreds of years of knowledge, serves as the perfect background to place the characters, as a metaphor for a way of life that is quickly disappearing, threatened by fast food and changes in family values. The director does not, however, focuses on mellow or sweetened scenes to show the conflict, but he maintains a humorous tone throughout the movie, placing the actors' performances on subtle gestures and witty lines which rely heavily on understatement and comedy-like situations. The basic premise of the movie suggests that change is not only inevitable but also necessary. However, the old values still need to be cherished and passed on to the next generation since they are the foundations which give sense and meaning to a life which tends to assimilate happiness to disposable items and economic success. In doing so, Chu and her daughters get reconciled, as well as their traditional background comes to terms with modernity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming window into Taiwanese home and personal life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful and touching movie. I give it a 9/10.In some ways similar to Babette's Feast, this movie is far more emotionally warm throughout, with none of the austere northern European Calvanism as is the backdrop needing (and getting) some thawing in that movie. It is also more engaging as a foodie movie, since the traditional high Chinese cooking pervades the whole movie, as the long widowed father's and hence the family's principal focus for emotionally communicating, sharing and supporting his three twenty and thirty something daughters. He has raised them since the youngest, 20 by the movie, was 4, almost entirely by himself -- and has obviously created a warm, thoroughly gentile, and loving, if somewhat reserved (perhaps a cultural norm?) household. He has devoted that part of his life not working in his restaurant entirely to caring for and loving his daughters -- and making them endless and routine family feasts, each Sunday and other times besides.*Spoiler*The ending is most life affirming as well. If there was ever a fifty something or perhaps sixty year old widower who deserved to effortlessly win a young woman the age of one of his older daughters (mid 30's?), initially by adopting her 9 year old or so daughter as almost his own grand daughter, it is Mr. Chu. Charmingly, the little girl derives status by bringing lunch pails stuffed with minor versions of his feasts to share at her school. As the movie ends, his new wife is giving the papa another daughter on the way, a little sister for his adopted "grandchild".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout this film, I was reminded of the film "Tokyo Story", in that it deals with how the changes in a child's life affects the parent(s). In this film, lensed in Taipei, the widowed father prepares Sunday dinner for his three daughters, all of whom experience life changes during the film. At first you do not like the eldest daughter, whose beauty reminds me a bit of the late, lamented Anita Mui, but she grows on you. What makes this film a delight is that during the film, as the story unfolds, you want to see something good happen to all of them. That is truly the mark of a well made film. The film has a richness that keeps you interested. In terms of scope, I also liken this film to the wonderful "YI YI". Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ang Lee's love poem to Taiwan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare films that came along and knocked me on my ass because of simply how close it is to my heart. My father is a chef from Taiwan and owned his own restaurant so I grew up around the sights and sounds that you could see in the movie. Even though our family unit is nothing like Chu's in the movie I could identify very well with the humorous and fatalistic trials and tribulations of your typical Chinese household. Eat Drink Man Woman also captured the hectic life of Taiwan fairly well.Ang Lee proves again what a master he is at blending his skilled hand at film making with contemporary and ancient eastern traditions to come up with this warm-hearted spirited movie. This is simply put a movie about life and enjoying the simple pleasures of family, food, and friends while you can while overcoming a narrow outlook to see the bigger picture. The message is simple but it's the delivery of it that counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hungry For Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To make the long story short, in this movie is shown the cycle of life: youth, maturity, old age, and how interact between them, with its ups and downs. Family, love, agreements, disagreements, relationships, friendship, birth and death.&nbsp; Despite the generational gaps, there is a common ground: the art of cooking, which appears as the silent and dispassionate observer which brings people and families together, and around which the life cycle unfolds.Quite apart from this, i am an Asian food lover and this movie was a torture since i saw it with my empty stomach. Cooked meals depicted in the film are the epitome of culinary delight. One can do nothing but feeling irresistibly tempted by this festival of colors and flavors.Probably they had hired traditional Chinese/Taiwanese food professional cooks.Having said that, I turn off my computer, and go to dinner to a Korean restaurant next door to my place. : )8,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ang Lee's lavish cuisine drama is at the top of his game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ang Lee's third feature film and the final chapter of his "family trilogy" in Taiwan before launching an outstanding career in Hollywood, after his debut PUSHING HAND (1992) and THE WEDDING BANQUET (1993, 9/10), EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN is consummately charming, and profoundly endearing, plus it is an unabashed food porn of Chinese cuisine. Ang Lee's regular screen patriarch Lung stars as Mr. Chu, is a 60-ish widower, an excellent chef with three grown-but-unwed daughters, the eldest one is Jia-Jen (Yang), a vocational school's chemistry teacher in her 30s with a dour looking, devoted to her Christian religion and fabricates a heartbroken story as an excuse to conceal the deepest embarrassment of her repressed yearning for a man inside her life, until she meets the new gym teacher Ming- Dao (Lu). Jia-Ning (Wang) is the youngest one, merely 20-years-old and works in a fast- food chain, unpremeditatedly steals her best friends' boyfriend Guo-Lun (Chen), Wang and Chen reunite here after their leading roles in Ming-liang Tsai's REBELS OF THE NEON GOD (1992, 6/10). Jia-Chien (Wu), the middle daughter, is Chu's favourite, a modern and independent woman secures an important position in an international airline company and receives a covetous promotion in Amsterdam, she engages a no-strings-attached relationship with her ex- boyfriend Raymond (Chan) and finds out Jia-Jen's secret through her dubious liaison with her new college Kai (Chao). Conspicuously, the linchpin of the film lies between Jia-Chien and Chu, their daughter-father connection is being dissected poignantly through Ang Lee's tender lens. There is also, Jin-Rong (Sylvia Chang), their neighbour and Jia-Jen's best friend from school, a divorcée bringing up a young daughter, and her recently-back-from-America mother Madame Liang (a Changsha-dialect-speaking Kuei), who never shies away from her (not-so-sublte) intention to remarry Mr. Chu, and she is the true comic relief and a great scene-stealer. All the main characters share one common trait: single-hood, no wonder the upshot is three marriages (or four if one considers one subplot) and two new babies. Ang Lee and his co-screenwriters shrewdly leave little hints intermittently from the beginning until the big revelation near the end during the whole family banquet, the script strikes a chord with the universal relevance of affections between blood relations. Embroidered with heartfelt leading performances from Lung and Wu, greatly impressive supporting turns from Yang and Kuei, as long as the appetising dishes enticing both our senses of taste and vision, Ang Lee cooks up another exquisite main course with his impeccable intuition and even-handed execution, 1994 is eminently a stunning year for cineastes, both in the Orient and the Occident.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film's major opening scene is Master Chu preparing Sunday dinner for his three distracted daughters. Watching the meal being prepared is something I can do over and over and over, and I have. It's not just a meal - it's a culinary masterpiece...a mouthwatering work of art. Every meal he prepares throughout the film is the same. He pours his whole being into feeding his girls; I think it's the most effective tool he has for telling him that he loves them, when he doesn't seem to know how to do it any other way.I loved every little moment of this film. The character development is quietly effective, the interplay of the actors is beautiful, even little Shan-Shan is wonderful.This is another film that I've added to my personal collection. I love trying to pick up Chinese words and phrases, and I'm getting better and better every time I see the film. I've probably seen it 10 times at the time I'm writing this.It's a very engaging slice of Chinese life. And in my limited understanding of the Chinese language and culture, the title of the film seems perfect. Eat Drink Man Woman. Yes, exactly.Give it a try. I think you'll be glad you did.Thanks for reading my review, and ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eat drink man woman is one of the nicest romance movies I have ever seen. The three sisters, all so different and all so unique trying to deal with their hen-like culinary Papa was no less than a delight.I think this is my favorite movie by Ang Lee for several reasons?one being the "different" direction for each sister and the father. Each was alike a separately constructed movie?the best being the father's own story, and the goofy but endearing "religious" sister, the eldest who I think is called Jia-Jen. Jia-Jen's story is almost directed like a documentary of a mysterious country in the midst of dictatorship! Just perfect for her personality and the way she is living. She is remote and repressed and clings to Christianity, even shunning her sisters at times. At school she is an ice maiden?which is not lost on her students, and the boy's coach who is respectfully sweet to her despite her coldness towards him. One day at school..she gets an anonymous love note and more follow. While there is some hope there for the withdrawn Jia-Jen, she also can't really handle the fact that she has no control over it. One day she finds out the truth and is left crying in her classroom. The coach tries to comfort her and she explodes maybe for the first time in a good way and the coach doesn't have much choice in the matter.The nicest and most poignant story was Chef Chu himself?but I won't describe that as it was the best surprise of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lee's 'Yin Shi Nan Nu' is one of the tastiest movies I've seen in recent times. Food is served as a metaphor here. Just the way you need the right ingredients to create a delicious dish, it's the same with life. Ingredients like friendship, love, food, sex and work are essential for life. However, merely knowing the ingredients isn't enough. It's the quality coupled with quantity that proves crucial.'Yin Shi Nan Nu' tells the story of a father, Chu, who is a celebrated chef, and his three daughters Jen, Chen and Ning. All three daughters are in their twenties and they still live with their father. Even though each are adults and have their own job, Chu feels responsible for them. They in turn feel responsible for their father and this feeling of obligation stands as a barrier between in their career path and romantic relationships.The daughters clearly love their father but there is too much frustration for the family to be functional.Lee gives his film a one-of-a-kind touch. It's very poetic, metaphoric, poignant and funny. The story is very down to earth and the movie looks and feels authentic. The characters and their dilemma are very recognizable. Lee gives a glimpse of the depth of his insight into human nature. He is truly a unique (and versatile) filmmaker.The food in the film is exotic and you'll crave for some Chinese. Perhaps you can order or have some homemade Chinese dish while watching this delightful recipe of life. In addition, this might sound a little out of place but the cinematography is stupendous.Sihung Lung is spellbinding as the patriarch of the family and master chef who is looking for some peace of mind while burdened by the responsibility of taking care of his daughters. Kuei-Mei Yang, Chien-lien Wu and Yu-Wen Wang are brilliant as the three daughters. The supporting cast is splendid.Overall, this is one delicious little film. Get ready for some Chinese while you experience this slice, no, recipe of life that Ang Lee involves you in. Yummy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most exquisite films about cooking and life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film again recently on DVD, for the first time in years. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed it.First and foremost, the filming of the cooking scenes are some of the most exquisitely shot scenes you will ever see. Ang Lee in this film reveals himself to be a master chef of cinema.The film's theme, having to do with the interaction of cooking with the unexpected ebb and flow of life and relationships, makes this a must-see film for me. I think I loved the continually surprising turning of events as much as anything and was as satisfied at the end as if I had just finished a multi-course meal, prepared, as I wrote, by a master chef. Nothing in this movie turns out as you expect it to. That is part of the film's genius."Eat Drink, Man Woman" is a treat on so many levels. It is a film that celebrates all the flavors of life and family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ang Lee's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ang Lee's talent comes together in this movie. He sets the stage in his native Taiwan, but makes powerhouse of delivery that's convincing to the western audience as well. Beautiful cinematography is part of Ang Lee's style, and we are treated to some of the best sceneries around Taipei in this movie.The story is about a father (who is a master chef) with three daughters, and a family history spanning two generations. Each finds love in their sometimes not so conventional ways, with deceit being hidden ingredient in all of them. The story's plot is excellent, and creates one of the best drama ever told on screen.Chien Lien Wu makes knock out delivery of the part as young executive working in Taipei.Last of Ang Lee's "Father knows best" trilogy, this was the defining movie for Ang Lee that set his career as Oscar winning director. One of the best Asian/Hollywood movie to come out, this little gem of a movie deserves to be a classic in both categories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>subtle work of genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone had commented how Austenian this one is, and the comparison is apt -- there's the irony and interpersonal intricacy, worries of marriage and woefully obnoxious neighbors. But there's a crucial difference, I think, between this and Sense and Sensibility, which reflects Ang Lee's genius. The difference is what Lee identifies as the thread to set his picture *against.* In Austen, Lee accurately mined out the latent savagery of Imperial society -- the most memorable moments are shots of Winslet on the windswept moor and Thompson's face, contorted with happy tears, when she finds that she's got a chance for her love. His magic is setting the picture in the exact opposite realm -- but in a way that throws that thread in pure, visceral relief.In Eat, Drink, Man, Woman, I think it's the competing virtues of romantic and filial love, which represent old and new values of contemporary China. The way Lee chooses to end the film is particularly telling. The sequence with daughter Jia-Chen comes at the end -- after the scene with Jin-Rong, the new wife for whom Chu is selling his old house -- and notice the way Lee lingers on Chu's face at his parting with Jin-Rong. She says, "love you," but he can only smile back -- it's the inescapable tug of old China and filial values that prevents complete fulfillment of this new role. It's only with Jia-Chen and their final, mutual acknowledgment that catharsis can take place. It's the affirmation of old values that has been the true thread of the movie and not the escape into new values, as enacted by the daughters' pursuit of lives away from their father. The movie works so well because Lee understands, as Chu does, how impossible it is to declare the truth -- he casts it into relief, and the result is subtle, noble, and loving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Eroticism of Chinese Dining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The eroticism of exquisitely prepared and presented food underlies Ang Lee's early film, "Eat Drink Man Woman." Although little is consumed, meals are the focal point for gatherings of a widowed chef, his three unmarried daughters, and a divorced neighbor and her young daughter. Lee's film has little plot other than the romantic pairings of the family. Members announce events over the obligatory Sunday dinner, and little by little each reaches independence apart from the group, yet remaining tied to the family.While the cuisine is Chinese, the story is universal, and, like life, not every string is neatly tied. However, the food is colorful, appetizing, and beautifully arranged. Not since "Babette's Feast" has food starred so spectacularly in a film. Although the sight of live frogs, chickens, and fish waiting for the knife may disturb some viewers, no animals are killed on screen. This family is definitely not vegetarian. The hours consumed in preparation do seem excessive given how little is eaten and how much is thrown out or given away. However, Chu, the father and chef, is an artist, a painter who works in food, a sculptor of comestibles. One character even describes him as a living cookbook.Filmed in Taiwan with Mandarin dialog and English subtitles, "Eat Drink Man Woman" is a low-key, but outstanding, family drama set against a tapestry of mouth-watering Chinese dishes. At least three of the cast appeared in Lee's earlier film, "The Wedding Banquet," and the charm and delights that imbued that 1993 film are even more evident in this more polished work. Few will finish a viewing without hugging their siblings and going out together for a Chinese meal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Description of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think, with negative-help of being somehow truly-realistic, the message of this movie has not reached to the destination well.This movie is really easy-watching, as the "story(!)" seems quite daily. Characters play good enough, and things happen convincingly.Although every member of family tells us her/his story arbitrarily, I believe there is only one single idea out there, and it is: Eat, Drink, Man and Woman!... But skip the words Eat and Drink here; they are just describers. This movie is all about Man and Woman.(Sorry for not remembering characters' names.)Father: In theory, he is a semi-living dead. He had only one noticeable thing in his lifespan, and it was his wife, who is now dead. A completely traditional guy, of whom life is not so "enjoyable", except a true love; and now she is dead. Moreover, his profession now left him too: He has lost her sense of taste, and feels he is no good cook any more, which is a really big loss for him, as being a cook is a big part of his life.. At the end he acts very surprisingly and gets married with the most unexpected woman! Elder sister: A religious, although being a Far-Eastern she is a Christian, girl. She is a kind of person who brings you a feeling of trust convincingly. But she is not. Absurdly, she has a big lie saying her first and only boyfriend left her and gone to USA with another girl, nine years ago. She has been resentful to life since then. The guy in fact did those things exactly, but to her confidant friend, not her!.. She told the story as if it happened to her. The reason can be anything surely, perhaps she was deeply in love with that guy, and just imagining that he had been with her, or she was just a masochist who just fake up a lie and made everybody believe, including herself, or anything else... She addicted the love notes and believed that they were from the sports teacher, but they were not... I believe, then again she made herself believe another day dream. She deeply kissed the guy, in contrast to knowing that he was not the love-letter-writer. But she believed in that, he must be him). All in all, she is someone that the effect of love on her life is clearly perceptible.Girl The Career: Angry to his father, that's the biggest info about her. This anger reflects her anger to men, as she has no happy love life. Being squished between her insincere work life and cold relation with the boyfriend, she is unhappy. By a good accident, the felt in love with another guy about whom her sister lied. She is another directly-or-indirectly-love-is-a-matter-in-my-life person.Youngest sister: The most innocent one! She is really young and the smallest of the family. Moreover, there is always a subject about leaving the family in their house, and normally she seems like the most probable to left his father last. But she dated with her friend's boyfriend, and got pregnant. Then she became the one who left the house first.As sum, there is a high effect of man and woman relations on every character in this movie.People eat and drink, always. And they are men and women, with a strong connection in between. This is so well-known that we are not surprised so much by picturesque things, like short stories in this movie.Very sensitive movie of Ang Lee, and I believe it deserves a ********* (9).</fullReview>

Their father, Chu, (Sihung Lung) who is a famous chef loves to cook for his girls on Sunday's and prepares many dishes of Taiwan food. This story begins to dwell on each of the daughter's lives, some of them are interested in young men and want to get married and others want to succeed in the business world and one even wants to become a religious person and another loves her father very much and wishes to live with him and take care of him. There is plenty of romance, sex and very upsetting happenings in the modern day world of Taiwan. Very entertaining film with comedy, drama and romance. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Family Love in Taiwan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eat Drink Man Woman1994 - Taiwan In 1993, Ang Lee had delighted audiences worldwide with his witty tale of generation conflicts in 'The Wedding Banquet.'In 'Eat Drink Man Woman' he quickly followed up with another story of how parents and children struggle to resolve value conflicts in modern Asia. Sihung Lung, the center of the film portrays Master Chu, a famous chef in Taiwan who is widowed and deeply loves his three daughters. They are young adults, however, and fiercely independent?..just like him. He does not know how to express his love, but he obligates them to come to his home for his banquet dinner every weekend. (By the way, don't see this film on an empty stomach, or it will be painful for you to watch the preparation of delicious Chinese cuisine. Ang Lee filmed the hands of the most famous chefs in Taiwan as they created their specialties for the family feasts.)Yet, the daughters don't like the ritual, referring to it as 'the Sunday torture.' They punctuate the ordeal with formal announcements, which are followed by yet another long silence.The most strong-minded of these, his eldest daughter, is a school teacher. After many years of disinterest in men, she suddenly pursues a handsome, free-spirited volleyball coach and, after their marriage, bullies him into becoming a timid, devout Christian. The youngest steals the boyfriend away from a college schoolmate. She later creates quite a stir at the family dinner when she quietly says, 'I have an announcement; I'm going to have a baby.'The story, however, centers on the complicated, loving relationship between Master Chu and his third daughter, Jia-Chien, a successful airline executive. Like him in many ways, she always had wanted to be a master chef, but he bowed to the tradition against women in this profession.After a traumatic love affair with a philanderer, she almost decides to take a job promotion with the airline and relocate to Europe. Yet, she stays on in Taiwan to help her father recover from the death of his fellow chef and best friend.Then she tries to find a new wife for him, unwisely targeting an obnoxious older woman who lives nearby. However, he is the next to make a startling family announcement???he is engaged to be married instead to the woman's daughter!!This modern tale proceeds to take many delightful twists and turns. At the end, Master Chu and Jia-Chien learn to understand each other. He recognizes that she???his daughter but just like him??..should be the next master chef of his restaurant. She comprehends the depth of his special love for her. As the camera fades away, they address each other simply as 'daughter' and 'father.' They have no more 'announcements' ?only with honest and open declarations of love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People come and go, family is forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read some comment from Douban, or Chinese version of IMDb indicating that Ang Lee had predicted the emerging conflicts between the traditional Chinese family with the western civilization in 1990's, while some domestic Chinese soup opera today still try to discuss about the same topics. Ang lee is incredible director, in his ever first period of career, he tried to elucidate the complex Chinese concept of family. Eat and drink represent a metaphor of conservative Chinese's view towards the live, food is the origin of sweet, sour, spicy and bitter, just like the family for ever family member. The Chinese cuisine is elaborated and ritual, in which announcement&#x3001;quarrel result from. The chef father lose his taste and retain in the happy ending, he mentioned in one episode that what he taste is sentiment, not the taste itself, which pertain to the metaphor of getting rid of the routine life and gain another one. Some comments interpret the Electra complex inclination of the neighbor sister, namely Jing Rong, the chef finally get out of the conservative fence of marriage, so did his three daughters, I believe the origin insight result from the cultivation procedure of family, the effect is bilateral actually, the girls learn the responsibility of father, the father get encourage from his daughters' affair. The round table represents the relationship of the father and daughter: people come and go, the family is forever, just like a circle, and the food within the circle, the taste of it, the memory of the food.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A senior chef (Sihung Lung) lives with his three grown daughters; the middle one (Jacklyn Wu) finds her future plans affected by unexpected events and the life changes of the other household members.Hal Hinson wrote, "As the relationships evolve and deepen, there seems to be a surprise around every corner?for both the characters and the audience. But what is most surprising, perhaps, is how involved we become with these people. As satisfying as food can be, the fullness we feel at the end here is far richer and more complex than that offered by the most extravagant meal." I loved the blend or sights and sounds. The colors are vibrant, especially when focused on the food. And the sounds are not what we might expect from an Asian setting; some come across as more Latin American. This strengthens the film, really making it something of an international flavor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of food, family, and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master Chef Chu is a semi-retired Chinese chef at the Taipei Grand Hotel, and also has three daughters. The eldest Jia-Jen is a Chemistry teacher who has been converted to Christianity while nursing a broken heart from nine years ago during her college days, the middle one Jia-Chien is an airline executive who is a career woman at the same time, the youngest Jia-Ning is a student who works at a fast food restaurant.There is a tradition where every Sunday, Chu and his three daughters will gather round for an elaborate dinner with the dishes he has prepared. When the film begins, the three daughters encounter a new man in their respective work lives. There is also the arrival of their family friend Jin-Rong, her daughter Shan-Shan and her mother Madam Liang. Jin-Rong has returned back to Taipei after getting a divorce from her American husband in the United States.As the three daughters especially the middle one Jia-Chien trying to seek lives of their own, Chu found solace in his colleague and friend Old Wen with the latter trying to talk sense into Chu as the semi-retired chef began to lose his sense of taste of the food he has always cooked and the daughters who are seeking independent lives outside of the house they have always lived in, even after their mother had died 16 years prior to before the film begins.But as much as it is about Chu trying to come to terms with his daughters wanting to seek independent lives, it is also about the daughters trying to find their purpose in life especially for the eldest two. Then there is also the element of the mother of their family friend Madam Liang as she became shocked over what would become of her daughter.The film title may seem out of place, but it is actually a quote from one of the Confucian classics Book of Rites or Li Ji, when it is actually referring to the basic human desires and accepting them as natural. As the film progresses, there is a sense that even Chu is trying to accept the fact that there will come a day his daughters will be leaving the house with their future respective husbands. Is seeking love as that straightforward as it is when it comes to everyone gathering round the table for a meal together? There is always something about food which brings people together, and it is the case when it comes to a family looking at life in a different way after reaching a certain stage in their respective lives. And it is the case in this heart-warming film as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crowd pleaser from Ang Lee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie was released in the 1990s I like it a lot; it's about three Taiwanese sisters (whose age range from the early thirties to the late teens) living in Taipei with their widowed father, a famous chef who has lost his sense of taste. All the three sisters are single, so a major theme of the plot is about their relationships (or lack of) with men. The most interesting of the three is in my opinion the older and plainer sister, who works as a teacher in a high school and is a practicing Christian. She is the most emotionally troubled of the three (though nothing really serious happen to her of to anybody in the film) and is played by Yang Kuei Mei (who would later play many risky roles in Tsai Ming Liang's movies). The middle sister is a young executive in some corporation while the younger sister seems to be still in high school. Seeing it now, I can see the movie is nothing spectacular, but is pleasing and well filmed by Ang Lee (Chinese food and its preparation is a motif of the movie, though it's not what I find particularly interesting about the film)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film-maker Ang Lee scores a win with this film about a widower master chef and his three attractive 20-something daughters. "Eat Drink Man Woman" is a sensitive portrayal of emotional dynamics as the daughters wrestle with leaving the nest, whether physically or psychologically. In this somewhat stiff, formal family, people communicate - or fail to communicate - through food; and the viewer is treated to many sensuous culinary scenes. Yet as the movie progresses, we witness the characters' growing drive to verbalize what they mean and feel. The beauty of the daughters is depicted in a very restrained manner, so if you're looking for Chinese eroticism, best to look elsewhere. Give this fine movie a chance. "Eat Drink Man Woman" will have added appeal for most female viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With one possible exception (and you know well what that is),Ang Lee has certainly crafted his lion's share of fine film fare over the years. From 'The Wedding Feast',through 'Brokeback Mountain',he has put his blood,sweat &amp; tears into each of his films. 'Eat,Drink,Man,Woman' is another shining example. Tao Chu (played by Sihung Lung)is a semi retired chef that has worked at a posh Taipei restaurant for most of his life,is a widower with three adult daughters,who has lost most of his sense of taste (to the extent that his second in command is expected to taste each &amp; every dish). Dao's three daughters are strong,independent women,who seem to have really,really bad luck with their choices in men. In addition,Dao oversees a young, newly divorced mother with an overbearing mother who every body loves to hate. What I admired about this film was the individual stories about the three daughters (kind of like what Wayne Wang did with his version of 'The Joy Luck Club'),and of course,all of that food being prepared &amp; enjoyed on screen (another film to undertake after enjoying a full meal,as you'll be roaring hungry afterward). The film benefits from a well written screenplay (written by Ang Lee, with his frequent collaborator,James Schamus &amp; Hui-Ling Wang),and some sumptuous photography that makes the proceedings look really good on film). Worth seeking out either on DVD,or even better (if there's a revival)on screen. Spoken in Mandarin with English subtitles. Rated PG,by the MPAA for a bit of rough language,and some adult situations</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is one of the rare foreign films that are not denied to capitalize on their little different concept because of slow pace?bad casting or dull visuals. This movie is good combination of drama and comedy? the movie revolves around a family of four..a father and his 3 daughters and shows how differently human beings can become even though they were born and brought up under the same roof. The eagerness starts from the first scene itself where you just see somebody cooking and cooking some great looking Chinese food..you keep wondering how would this scene be connected to a movie. The editing of the movie is also great since every scene you see something moving forward for a character, in a round robin fashion. I am sure the movie would have been more fun had I known Chinese myself but still it was far better quality than any other colored drama-comedy foreign films I have watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Eat Drink Man Woman" is a sweet little drama that is one of those little treasures that only comes when you least expect it.The story about an older man who keeps all of his emotions bottled up inside of him, which is probably for the best since his three beautiful daughters could really care less. But throughout the course of the movie, events happen that cause all of them to re-examine their lives and their relationships.Ang Lee is definitely one of the most gifted directors around, and this movie gives evidence to that. It's a strong movie in every respect; thematically, symbolically, and especially in its characters. All of the characters are three dimensional, and all are brought to life with brilliant performances. It's only in the hands of Ang Lee that all of these people could have been developed so strongly and evenly. The three daughters experience the most change. In the beginning of the film, all of them are only concerned with their own lives and can't stand the weekly Sunday dinner with their father (despite the fact that their father works tirelessly in the kitchen to create some of the most gorgeous looking meals ever to grace the screen). But throughout the course of the movie, they start to care more about people other than themselves, especially their father.In a more mainstream film, everything would have been treated more heavily, but Ang Lee resists that temptation and uses a lot of restraint. This gives the film a great dose of realism, so much that it doesn't seem like a film, but instead an examination of the lives of some ordinary people. This also helps create the tone, which is rather light and pleasant.If you're looking for a film without any subtlety or big stars, or where big things happen at regular intervals, this film isn't for you. It's not that kind of a movie. But definitely check it out. It really is a wonderful film.</fullReview>

There are other food movies such as Barbettes feast, Like Water for Chocolate and Antonia's line which I definitely say you should all go and see the fact of a chef loosing his sense of smell and then regaining it is a good basis for a movie but this goes so much deeper than that because that is just the coating for the three daughters who live in the house and the way they were brought up, remember if watching this at home Chinese takeout is a must accompaniment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrary to what the other viewer said, THIS IS NOT A "CHICK FLICK" whatever the hell that means~ If anything this is ultimately a movie about a man.This is a movie about men and women and our common needs to be loved by someone, to love and to taste great food (Eat, Drink, Man, Woman...the basic needs of all humans).The acting and wonderfully real dialogue makes up for the lack of explosions and guns (maybe this is why it's a "chick flick" rolls eyes~).I've seen this movie 5 times and it's still so good every time. I think that it's inspired how we also get a very insightful look at life from an older generations' point of view. Sihung Lung (the father) is so charming, I personally think he makes the movie. He looks like someone everyone would love to have as a Father. Very likable and a great actor. I'm amazed at his acting every time.I thought that all the actresses (daughters) were brilliant. My favorite is always the second airline executive daughter (ChienLien Wu).All of the supporting cast is so good as well. The lovely piano piece at the end captures the mood of this movie perfectly.All in all, this is a 10/10 movie with something for everyone because it touches on so many levels. It's insightful, confident, deep, touching, and most importantly it's easy to watch and follow. A graceful movie that explores complex themes. I always leave this movie feeling refreshed and hopeful.

Ang Lee, using food as a metaphor, created an environment filled with tension, love and emotions. Tastebuds, basically, represents happiness, and when the father lost his taste buds, he lost his happiness in life. Especially since his spouse died when she was young and a great friend of his died of a heart attack. He and his daughters use their Sunday "torture" dinners to communicate with each other and to exchange emotions and feelings. Great movie, great actor and great director.-8/10-</fullReview>

Oh, and the food is to die for (excepting the soup cauldron...).If you are expecting a thriller or a mystery, this is only mildly mysterious and not at all thrilling.

		<fullReview>A successful feel-good movie is a difficult feat to pull off, and for a while there I thought the only person who had really mastered the art was Woody Allen; but with Eat Drink Man Woman (1994), director Ang Lee proves that he can do it just as well. Eat Drink Man Woman is a sort of Chinese version of Hannah and Her Sisters, telling the story of an aging chef and his three daughters as they manage to find love in their dull lives. Like a good Woody Allen film, all of the characters are written so that we see ourselves (and others) in them: the eldest daughter is a chemistry teacher who converted to Christianity and worries that she will spend the rest of her life taking care of her father; the second oldest is a businesswoman who's caught between her current lover and a new assistant at work; and the youngest works at a fast food restaurant and is unexperienced in the ways of love, knowing only the manipulative infatuation of childhood. Intriguing as they all are, the most fascinating character of the film is that of the father: struggling to keep his family together as they all begin to go their separate ways, he is a loving parent in search of the same thing as his children. Eat Drink Man Woman is a seductive and beautiful movie, filmed lusciously by cinematographer Jong Lin (who also worked on Lee's previous two films, The Wedding Banquet and Pushing Hands). The screenplay is smart and insightful -- a delicate balance of emotion and hilarity; the plot moves unexpectedly but never loses its balance, and while the direction of the story may seem ambiguous at first, the conclusion ties everything together in a moving final scene. One thing I always enjoy about foreign films is that I am often unfamiliar with any of their actors, so my mind isn't distracted by preconceived notions; even though I have seen some of the actors here in other films (Sihung Lung, who plays the father, was also in Lee's first two movies), each performance still appears seamless, and the actors submerge themselves entirely into their roles. If these aren't enough reasons for you to see it, then its genuine love for life should clinch it; it is a poignant and often funny slice-of-life drama with an optimistic edge that never belies reality. Eat Drink Man Woman earned a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film, and it is truly one of the best pictures of the year. The title for the film comes from a scene in which the father complains, "Eat, drink, man, woman ... is that all there is to life?" After watching this movie, that doesn't sound like such a terrible thing.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Different people suffer from different problems, but the solutions may have no difference. The chef, despite his age, is brave enough to forget the past and start a new life. Barrier of course is inevitable. Leaving the house full of memory is no easy task. The second daughter, on the contrary, is brave enough to enter into her own past. She wants to be modern but modern suits her not quite well. No way she can escape when seeing her father in the hospital. It's a scene very moving. Her upbringing is a part of her world, and no one can escape from the world of themselves. I am happy to see that she has no need to pretend anymore. Some excellent movies Ang Lee has made in recent years, but the one I like the most is still Eat Drink Man Woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leaving home, fulfilling family's expectation, leading a life probably against your own will, feeling your aging father and his love... I find myself in tears everytime I watch the love and conflict between the old patriarch and his son/daughter in the first three films by Ang Lee. Instead of dealing with the relationship between father and only son (as in "Pushing hands" and "The Wedding Banquet"), "Eat Drink Man Woman" tells a story about a father and his three daughters who are about to leave their home. It gives you the taste of food as well as the taste of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely one of my favourites. It has a permanent place on the shelf, where I keep a handful of other cinematic treasures. It's such a heartwarming story of a family, and so familiar to me - the gathering of the family over dinner, the problems, the friction between a parent and a child. Of course, can't not mention the food, which plays an important part. It was fabulous! The pace here is different, there is not much of the so called "action", no grand schemes, convoluted mysteries. Yet, the story-telling is so absorbing, it pulls you gently in, and lets you explore the relationships. It's a feast for the eyes and the soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! Beautiful and intelligent women, beautiful food and touching stories that intertwine with some unexpected turns. I don't usually have the patience for sub-titled movies (I'm much less fond of dubbing), but this one really grabbed me. If only we could master more than a couple of languages and schools in the US would teach multiple languages like the European schools do, but I digress. Three daughters and their widower father share the family home. One roof covers many separate lives. The mother has been dead for 16 years. The youngest is in school and is 20 years old. You really feel the middle daughter's pain as she tries to reconcile her desire for leaving home and finding love against her success at work. The oldest daughter, a teacher, too has trouble with love, since her "heart is still broken after nine years."The father is also ill and his failing palate is not supporting his fantastic cooking skills. This first shows up in the Sunday night family dining ritual. He is a Master Chef in a huge restaurant with his brother Wen and he loves to cook lunches for a little girl that is the daughter of an old family friend. She is his virtual granddaughter, or is she? The food is as much of a character as any of the others. It looks so good that you wish that you could reach out for some of it. This family has difficulty talking about what is really happening to them in their personal lives. They communicate only when they are eating during the family ritual. This family has many emotional hills to climb and we get to watch as they learn to open up with each other and grow together.I would gladly watch this movie many times and appreciate getting to hear the language since it is sub-titled instead of dubbed. This film has broad appeal to many audiences and cultures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie Full Of Humour And Significant Insight! Also Warmhearted!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several Ang Lee's films I have seen recently. "Eat Drink Man Woman" is one of them. May not be the best but definitely has the plot most warm-hearted and entertaining. This movie is great in a number of ways. The food preparation of course livens up the film very much, but the thing that really makes this movie very watchable for me is the way Lee describes the transformation of the chef's second daughter - the character most complex in this movie. Nothing I find unmotivated in her transformation, and too measured also. The development creates a sense of coherence in a manner very natural. Representing a typical youth of oriental societies, whom both oriental tradition and western culture influences her greatly, the character must find a way to balance those influence. No doubt a matter not so easy to handle. Escaping from the past is a way very usual, but absolutely not the one very suitable, to tackle such kind of difficulty. Aspiring to remove from the old house and the failure of this attempt symbolize this point clearly. Busy everyday but I saw no direction of her life. However, unexpectedly meeting her father in hospital makes a turning point and her life is also salvaged after that. Two scenes here I like very much - rejecting her so-called boy friend and starting a friendship, pure and sincere, to her colleague. Contrarily, her elder sister hides herself in the past, more accurately, the imaginary past, shows another kind of escapist. Tradition for such kind of people is nothing but an excuse to avoid the challenge in fact inevitable. The description to the chef is also interesting. Indeed a story very mediocre. But Ang Lee gives it life and thought and thus nothing vulgar can be found. Absolutely not a level that a metter-en-scene can achieve. Also full of humour and no doubt a movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eat Drink Man Woman is the Film that turned me on to Ang Lee. The tale of a Father and his 3 daughters in Taiwan, it cleverly shows the erosion of the traditional family due to changes in society, due to the influence of Religion, Music, Technology, Sexual Liberation, and the 'Westernisation' of Taiwanese Culture.The family does, however, retain one ritual, one which is sadly missing from most families now, the evening meal. And what meals! The fathers existence seems to rotate around the preparation of the meal, as his other roles within the family diminish. And, of course, the meals are a hotbed of discussion, mainly on the subject of relationships.Each member of the family has their own relationship, and each with a very different person. This causes no end of conflict, and ultimately a neat surprise.Involving, Touching and Light Hearted, Eat Drink Man Woman is a beautiful film, beautifully observed. It's a simple story, but all the better for it.At least 9/10</fullReview>

Like all humans they have their strengths and their frailties and Ang Lee allowed us a glimpse of these through the inter-personal relationships the characters have with each other. The introduction of the obnoxious mother of the 'neighbour' adds a twist that brings about the unexpected announcement near the end of the movie. It's funny, sad, uplifting and of course mouth watering. The sub-titles don't take much away from the experience. See it now. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ang Lee is an incredibly talented director who has demonstrated his range by directing several excellent, but striking different (from one another) movies. "Eat, Drink, Man, Woman" is an example of a remarkable movie that was probably very inexpensive to produce, and so well done, that it is easy to forget that I watched it reading English subtitles.In relating the story of an elderly Chef and his 3 adult daughters, this movie is populated by complex, real characters that are well acted and believable. As an added bonus, the cooking scenes are spectacular! Watching this movie on an empty stomach would be torture, but I would recommend being a little bit hungry in order to really appreciate the film.If you liked "Sense and Sensibility" (another of Ang Lee's superb films), I would recommend giving this one a try. If your idea of a good movie is "the Mummy Returns" then this might not be your favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly the most beautiful film I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ang Lee is, I think, the best director around today, and Eat, Drink, Man, Woman, is the height of his achievements to date. It is a story of a man entering retirement and his three daughters, who are all coming to terms with adulthood. As in all Ang Lee films the cinematography is spectacular, and the opening sequence is a wonderful demonstration of Chinese culinary excellence (as well, of course, as Lee's extraordinary talent), and it is almost impossible not to stop the film right there, go and get some chinese takeaway to eat, and come back to enjoy the film without the cravings that this film inevitably produces. The Characters are complex and likeable, and the relationships between them is what this film (and every other one of Ang Lee's masterpieces) is all about. The family is slightly dysfunctional and communication is often strained but as the movie develops these dialogs become more heartfelt, and the love between the characters becomes more and more apparent.There is a healthy mixture of humour and drama in this film. Basically a slice of life film, portraying a family living their lives together, nothing 'happens' in the film, we simply see a family coming of age, dealing with tragedy both from the past and as it is dealt to them. (Of course the films where, as i say, 'nothing' happens are often the best, since this allows space for us to see characters reveal themselves slowly and much more deliberately than in more quickly paced films). There are a few nice plot twists in the film, the main one of which is genuinely surprising and funny, and ties in superbly with the opening scene of the movie. Finally the story is wrapped up in a stunningly sincere and beautiful scene between father and daughter, which invariably leaves me sitting in total silence until the end of the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chinese Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chu is the number one chef in Taipei, a master with no equal. Widowed, he lives comfortably with his three young-adult daughters. Each is a very independent woman, and each is very different from the other. And all three are on the verge of stretching their wings and going out in the world on their own. This poses dilemmas for all, and these personal trials are the focus of Ang Lee's movie; they're his story. Nothing overly dramatic, just modern urban people, successful people, coping and getting along.The only difficulty I had with the film is that I'm not familiar with the actors; especially those playing the three daughters. Obviously they're all Chinese and speak Mandarin. The film is heavy into conversation so the viewer reads lots of sub-titles. I frequently lost the point of a conversation because I didn't realize who was talking; I was too busy reading. It's a small complaint. On the plus side the movie delivers an ending. Often these 'slice of life' movies just end, there are no real plot elements to resolve and life goes on. Not here, Mr. Lee delivers an ending that will have you smiling after the Home Theater is darkened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (CTHD) last week, I made a point to get to the local Video Store to rent other titles by this talented American director. What a great slice of culinary delights! I really admire this director, Ang Lee! He had me tricked about the unusual directions the plot would shift into overdrive about; the CTHD surprises are nowhere to be found. This is a fun movie about food, family, aspirations, and modern sexual attractions that never crosses the line into anything distasteful. It is a voyeuristic trip into kitchens and restaurants, schools and an airline corporate office of some sort. Surprisingly for most monolingual/chauvinistic Americans, we even visit a "Wendy's Restaurant" and a "Toys-R-Us" store in Taipei. I will recommend this film to all who enjoy Chinese food (doesn't everyone?) and who have siblings. It provided me with the pace and look that CTHD lacked. I didn't need any breathless flying sequences to keep me on track in my springtime resolution to see all of this director's available films on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found nothing interesting about this film but the food. The story and craft are all fine, just not memorable. But the food was rich, and that alone makes this an important film.Film is a solvent art. Successful film leverages senses and emotions outside of itself, moreso than other arts. Only dance and architecture are similar in the directness and externalness. Violence, sex, celebrity, betrayal are the usual suspects. Food has been done before, but it appears to be difficult to evoke the sense of taste as richly through vision as we need.Lee has the advantage of Chinese cuisine, the preparation of which is strange and intriguing to Americans at least. He captures us by the mystery of what is going on by showing a lengthy preparation session before the first "story" scene, so we are in suspense about context.But Lee also has real art in what and how he has placed the images. He understands that it doesn't work to focus on the food itself. He gives us rich sounds -- gosh, what sound editing skills! He gives us movement as edibles slide from one implement to another. He gives us aromatic visions as things sizzle and smoke. He gives us ceremony in the presentation, but all BEFORE the table, made special meditations because once things get near the table, they are treated casually.Here is an echo of the hundredtwenty year old debate in the academy concerning easel painting. Portraits (character studies) are acceptable, human art. Landscapes are "real" art (in film, think of "Lawrence," "Out of Africa"... Ford westerns... maybe 1/4 of all films). But, so the academics held, "domestic still lifes" cannot be real art. At least we know this form is difficult and therefore rare in painting. More difficult and rare in film. Lee is an intelligent student of film, so understands this well. Experience this film; you won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raising daughters is like cooking a meal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, above all, a story about love. It shows several different renditions of love and how it effects each of us. All of our characters in this story are in love or about to experience love and will each deal with it in their own way. Father Chu lost his wife many years ago, and has been handed the task of caring for his three girls. He has not had the proper guidance in how to bring them up, and he always put his cooking before them, so it comes as no surprise that these three girls have grown up as three individual women. Each carries their own passions and secrets in life. The eldest, Jia-Jen is a teacher that claims to have lost love a very long time ago and has never had the urge to rediscover it. The middle child, Jia-Chien is a very powerful airline executive that does wonders in the working environment, but is lost in the outside world (especially the world surrounding her family). Finally, there is the youngest, Jia-Ning, a student and fast food worker that wants what others have. Together, these four people make up a family, and Lee tells their story.If you are new to Ang Lee films, it may be hard to watch this movie without enjoying the presence of a huge green man jumping mountains. For those veteran viewers of his work, this film will be seen as no surprise. This is a classic Ang Lee film. The themes of family, struggle, and love are dominant throughout all of his films. Eat Drink Man Woman is no exception. Lee does a fabulous job of crafting the boundaries of the family, providing the viewer with those awkwardly tense moments that make you feel that you are actually sitting there with the family as they air their 'dirty laundry'. By pulling us into this film and giving us some raw performances by the actors, you cannot help but somehow feel connected to this film. We have all experienced love (or even lust) at one point in our lives and understand the hardships that follow this joyous experience, especially if you grow up in a house similar to the one run by Father Chu. On an emotional level, this film works very well, but it is the other areas where this film does not succeed.Pacing, inconsistency, and underdeveloped center are what hurt this film in the long run. Lee has built a structure with this film by creating a powerful beginning and a heart wrenching conclusion, but what lies in the middle is nothing but leftovers. Our main characters are inconsistent, jumping from one unsuspecting emotion to the next as they finally reach their one 'true' moment. This is due in part by Lee's direction. When I first started this film, I felt that the story, camera, and direction were tight. It was flowing very well and my attention was focused directly on the film. About forty-five minutes in, I found my eyes wandering. I felt less connected with the characters as they stumbled through their lives and into love. Suddenly, it was as if Lee had awakened, and his style and power was reinstated for the last couple of scenes. This was my only complaint about this film. I needed more structure and development in the center so that I could fully enjoy the ending, but it never happened.Overall, Lee did an average job with this film. He has pure talent, and it is seen in his later films, but in this one I just couldn't put my arms around the middle of this film. I would suggest at least one viewing if you are an Ang Lee fan, but definitely not worth a second.Grade: ** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening scene, I thought I was going to like this movie. The scene was artfully filmed and the music was great accompaniment. I did have some problems with the carp preparation and especially the chicken preparation. Those scenes were strong advocacy for vegetarianism.After the first scene, the movie started going wrong for me. There was too much emphasis on food preparation. I often had to ask myself if I was watching a movie, or the cooking channel. For example, the meal prepared in the first scene could easily have fed a dozen people and seemed out of proportion to the occasion. I saw two whole chickens, a half dozen frogs, crab dumplings, a whole fish, ham, vegetables, and more.After sitting through most of the movie going through the love affairs of the three daughters, which were quite unimaginative and hardly above the level of a TV sit-com, it finally looked like we might at least get a watered-down version of King Lear. The old man, alienated by the changes he saw in society, abandoned by his daughters, feeling inadequate to pursue his profession, was faced with a situation to challenge his character and courage. I was interested to see how he would handle it. But what did we get, a totally bogus marriage to a woman the age of his daughters followed by a pregnancy. What a cop-out. The ending rally irritated me--I felt totally taken advantage of.The message of the movie seems to be that food and sex are the only meaningful things in life. I agree that they fuel much of what goes on, but there are a lot more things to enjoy as well.I give it a star for being well filmed and edited, a star for the music, and a star for giving us a look at modern Taipei--which looks pretty much like the U.S.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's two kinds of filmmakers. Those who just tell stories (Ron Howard, Edward Zwick) and those who try pushing the boundaries of film (David Lynch, Ralph Bakshi). This war between the "story" and "art" has been going on for over a century. Unfortunately, the "story" people took over when the medium was in its youth, thanks to the ignorance of Edison--the Jerry Bruckheimer of his day. Society is still suffering from this gross negligence.So, the "art" folks must disguise their efforts. Bakshi failed to get respect though he worked harder than Disney. Lynch succeeded with 'Elephant Man'. Scott had 'Blackhawk'. Kubrick had '2001'. Mendes is making himself known through "serious drama". Some, like Malick, have found their own cultural niche. Others, like Coppola, are lost.Spoiler minefield ahead...Ang Lee has been extremely successful in masking his efforts, his timing is also pretty convenient. 'Hulk' was the 'Batman' syndrome. 'Crouching Tiger' caught on the 'Matrix'/Bruce Lee fad. Here he tries the 'Moonstruck' spiel.This movie isn't the love letter that it initially looks like. If you examine the framing, it's actually about the Father cooking while he either A) meditates on past events or B) imagines how the evening will be. Pretty clever, huh?Watch Lee's use of the camera as a fluid medium, particularly in the kitchen. We examine the recipes, the cook, the ingredients, the process, everything falls under a discriminating eye to make certain it works. I have rarely seen such concentration on film.With those points in mind, see this to understand how we think about food and film. The best thing is you can watch this on a date and enjoy it in depth while your partner will be oblivious to these forces. Now you can say you're smarter.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good aperitif but a boring movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superb food saga and nothing much beyond that. The characters are incomparably more languid than the meals they are consuming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terribly boring film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help but feel there's something missing from this film... oh, yes, it's a plot. We're given three shallow girls, their boring dad and several other uninteresting characters, and we watch them all try to get boyfriends for two hours. This movie was downright painful to watch. Avoid this one.</fullReview>
