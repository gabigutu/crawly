		<fullReview>George (James Brolin) and Kathleen Lutz (Margot Kidder) buy a "dream house" in Amityville, New York for a "dream price". Unfortunately, the price was low because just a year before, the house was the location of the Ronald DeFeo Jr. murders--he killed his entire family while they were sleeping. As a priest, Father Delaney (Rod Steiger), blesses the home, he realizes with horror that something evil is lingering there. The dream house is turning into a nightmare.Sometimes our affection for or aversion to an artwork that we've been exposed to a number of times over the years is inextricably enmeshed with our historical, emotional experiences, whether we admit this or not. For example, I strongly dislike soap operas, or indeed any dramas that resemble soap operas. This is probably due to the fact that for years my only exposure to soap operas was when I was home sick from school as a kid. These were the days before cable television and home video. In the middle of a weekday afternoon, you either watched soap operas or you didn't watch television. Subconsciously, I associate soap operas with a feeling of illness.Likewise, Jay Anson's Amityville Horror novel appeared when I was still a teen. I loved it. I can still remember reading it in one long sitting--something I rarely did--in the family car as we drove from Florida to Ohio to visit relatives. I was excited when the film appeared, and liked it a lot at the time.So although I can see many faults with Amityville Horror now, I still have a deep affection for it that triggers my brain to go into an apologetic mode and defend the film. I just can't bring myself to give it lower than an 8 out of 10, and even that seems low to me. But I can easily see how audiences lacking a history with the film might dislike it. It is relatively slow, uneventful and meandering--with a modern perspective, the pacing and "subtlety" are reminiscent of some recent Asian horror. At the same time, maybe paradoxically, scenery chewing has only rarely had a greater ally.Just a couple days ago MGM released newly remastered widescreen versions of Amityville 1, 2 and 3. I haven't seen the film look this good since seeing it in the theater in 1979, and it probably didn't even look this good then. The first thing that struck me was how incredible much of the cinematography is. Director Stuart Rosenberg had an amazing knack for finding intriguing angles for shots and imbuing them with beautiful colors.Unlike recent trends, Rosenberg's colors are not narrowed down to a single scheme. For example, in some shots, such as some of the interiors of the famed Amityville house, we get fabulous combinations of pale greens and yellows. In others, such as many exterior shots near the house, we get intense combinations of fall foliage colors. There are also a number of beautiful shots of the famed "eye window" exterior of the house in differently tinted "negative" colors.Rosenberg evidences a great eye for placing his cast in the frame and shooting scenes to create depth and symbolism via objects that partially block or surround the frame. He also has a knack for creating winding, receding patterns of objects that enhance depth through perspective. My affection for this aspect of the film has little nostalgic attachment, as I didn't pay attention to such things as a kid (I didn't start noticing them more until I started painting, far into my adult years), and the positive aspects of the cinematography were hardly discernible on the previous, ridiculously bad pan &amp; scan VHS release.Of course, most people aren't watching a film like this for the aesthetics of the visual composition. This is one of the most famous haunted house films, after all. The horror is handled somewhat awkwardly, occasionally absurdly, but it still works well enough for me, as understated as it is (I'm not referring to the acting, just the horror "objects"). Aspects such as the ubiquitous flies reminded me of similar motifs, such as water, in Hideo Nakata's horror films (such as Ringu, 1998 and Dark Water, 2002). The beginning of the film, showing the Defeo murders, still has a lot of shock value, despite its relative post-Tarantino tameness. Most of the horror elements are more portentous, but they're regular and interesting enough to hold your attention, as long as you don't mind subtlety.Subtlety, however, was the furthest thing from the cast's minds. Brolin, Kidder and especially Steiger shout their lines more often than they speak them. "Overacting" is not in their vocabularies. Kidder comments on an accompanying documentary that the horror genre walks a fine line between intensity and camp. That may or may not be true in general, but in Amityville Horror, camp is frequently broached. For me, it has a certain charm. I'm a fan of camp and "so bad it's good"; Amityville's performances often attain both.The commentary on the new DVD is amusing given the 1970s publicity that the book and film depicted a true haunting and the subsequent, thorough debunking by persons such as Stephen Kaplan. Hans Holzer, a parapsychologist who has been involved with the story since the early days, and the author of a book upon which Amityville II was based, provides the commentary. He presents himself as an academic, but he obviously seems to have little concern for "objectivity" or skepticism. He not only still talks about the story as true, he invents supernatural excuses for the DeFeo murders and then some, barely mentioning detractors such as Kaplan.If you haven't seen the film yet, you should base your viewing decision on whether you have a taste for deliberately paced horror as well as a tolerance for extremely over-the-top performances. The film is historically important in the genre, as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True, the special effects aren't so special these days. True, the girl with the braces brings tears of laughter rather than terror. But nonetheless, this movie remains a creepy gem from my young days... Everyone misses the point that the real 'star' of the movie is the house! The building is both attractive and sinister - truly gothic in the importance of the setting. Whether the story is true or not, if you want a movie to snuggle on the couch in the dark, eating popcorn, feeling the thrill of a ghost story scare, this is one for you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excited about the remake I decided to go out and just but the original Amityville Horror. Being a huge horror buff, I just had to and besides I had only seen some of it's absurd sequels. hearing mixed reviews from friends and critics from terrifying to hilarious I turned it on with my boyfriend at the time and prepared myself for something scary. I must say that I was quite impressed. And although slightly disappointed in some of the films scenes ultimately I must say this is one old fashioned scary flick! I can hugely recognize the appeal it had in it's it's hey day. With the exception of Texas chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, the Omen and some others I rarely see what people did in their horror classics nowadays. Like The Exorcist, pretty damn boring and funny in my opinion. But getting back to this film. It builds a creeping mood filled with fright inducing suspense. The effects are simple but effective and the performances are somewhat over the top but necessarily wacky. The film's overall lasting appeal has little to do with the film's apparent campiness. it has more to do with the real terror inducing legend that inspired it. Like the Chainsaw remake the new ones looks to amp up the horror and intensity which would be greatly welcomed. Although a great horror classic Amityville's finale is somewhat anti climactic and after a long and impressively scary build-up it fails to deliver the end goods. But whoa some of the scenes from the imaginary friend Jody flying out the window, to the visitor at the door, to the voice in the house and just everything in the basement this film is all about delivering some authentic chills. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George and Kathy Lutz are looking for a place to anchor down and raise a family. The Lutz's and their children (Kathy's from a previous marriage) settle on an impossibly cheap, large and beautiful shore house. But 28 days later the macabre and scary happenings force them to leave?leaving all their earthly possession behind. During the course of those 28 days, the family goes through all kinds of hell a room full of flies, demonic voices and a pig with glowing red eyes. What kind of past does that house have that would make everything horribly wrong. Based on a true story.Real or hoax, you decide but "The Amityville Horror" has all the trappings of an excellent haunted house story. Too bad that the filmmakers falter a bit with a lack of character development that also ends up stifling the actors in the film, that would have helped out immensely. A creepy music score (the one rejected for "The Exorcist") and several good set-pieces help out but the end of the second act kind of gets stale. A good supernatural thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was but a timid lad of 14 when taken to a drive-in theater to see this incredibly effective horror film.There is no better monster to create a film around than the Devil himself.When Rod Steiger's character,Father Delaney is in the process of blessing the house,and was greeted by a resounding shout of "Get Out!",I almost took it literally,it was that effective.The Devil is indeed one unwelcome houseguest that is very hard to kick out,as you will see when you watch this film.James Brolin and Margo Kidder head a young family who are the new inhabitants of a home where brutal murders had taken place years before.Soon,strange happenings begin to haunt the family,as the house has trouble letting go of what had happened there.This movie is definitely in my top 10 horror films that I have seen,and if you enjoy being scared out of your wits,this film will do it for you.Give it a look!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stuart Rosenberg's "The Amityville Horror" should have catapulted him to the throne of the King of the Surreal, because this disjointed, shrill, and inexplicable flick is just as weird, if not weirder than, the oddest work of current King David Lynch. I'm not sure what the hell was going on in Rosenberg's life at the time, but this same year he directed another weird, cartoonish-yet-lethargic genre film, the Charles Bronson revenge vehicle, "Love and Bullets." Also both "Horror" and "Bullets" share totally inappropriate and WAY over the top performances by the great &amp; unique Rod Steiger. VERY MINOR POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD(if such is possible with a movie that makes no sense)Nothing much happens in "Amityville Horror" until the climax, just a lot of odd little things. But when that climax comes, and the movie suddenly ends, you realize that it answered no questions and, more importantly, made no sense at all! The film has no logic but dream logic--perfect surrealism. Characters float about aimlessly in search of some kind of coherent story, crying, screaming, chopping wood. The secondary characters appear and disappear without having any impact on the plot and without really doing anything, much the way characters in a dream come and go, shift and change for no reason. A psychic has visions--nothing comes of it. A cop has suspicions--he does nothing with them. a child has an imaginary ghost friend who may be at the root of it all--or not. A priest's life is ruined--because there were flies on the window! And--there's an evil pig in the window! I'll repeat myself--There's AN EVIL PIG IN THE WINDOW!! An EVIL PIG THAT DOES NOTHING! Really, the film is fascinating--all the more so since it is obvious that its fascinating qualities are entirely unintentional. A CLASSIC!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was based on the true story and it did a great job of re-creating what actually happened. The creepy way the little girl talks to the seemingly empty rocking chair and the 3:15 am horrifying nightmares over and over again would make anyone feel a little freaked out. The reaction of anyone who has anything to do with the church should have been a sign to get out of this house. The flies, cold spots, and eyes peering in and outside of the windows are all things that actually happened inside that house in Amityville Long Island. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a scary movie or for anyone who has been freightened of a house before. This movie does the trick without any fancy special effects.l</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who says the Lutz's don't throw wild parties?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Semi-classic thriller of the 70's, requires some patience from the audience but ultimately becomes a nicely moody film about America's most infamous haunted house.Couple moves their family into a Long Island house, where the previous owners where murdered, and begins to believe that there are evil forces at work in the new home.Based upon Jay Anson's novel, which itself is supposedly a true story, The Amityville Horror is a film that largely relies upon it's eerie, unsettling atmosphere to induce chills and it often works well. It also packs the occasional good shock. While some may see this films subtlety and occasional weirdness as a senseless plot, it really helps to create a rattling sense of dread. It plays out well, building tension slowly to a climatic finale and a open conclusion that leaves a great sense of mystery. Kudos also go to a wonderfully chilling musical score. The cast is fairly good, stars Brolin and Kidder are in top-form.While it may be bashed by many critics, The Amityville Horror has remained one of the 70's better horror oddities, and has become a cult classic for good reason. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Amityville Horror: An Entertaining Haunted House Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, I have truly enjoyed "The Amityville Horror," a 1979 haunted house flick that has been critically, and unfairly, bashed. Since it's based on a true story, the critics have found that they dislike the movie based on their knowledge of the movie's inspiration. Now, here's my opinion: fiction or non-fiction, Stuart Rosenberg managed to make a fun, campy, and all around creepy horror film that resonates as one of the most famous haunted house movies ever created.Everyone knows the legend about that house in Amityville, New York, the Dutch Colonial on 112 Ocean Avenue. The movie begins in 1974, when Ronnie DeFeo Jr. murdered his family in the house at 3:15 am, shooting them all in their sleep. A year later, George and Kathy Lutz bought the house and moved in with their three children and their dog, Harry. Aware of the tragedy that occurred in the home, George and his wife planned to fix it up and start a new life after their recent marriage. After all, "houses don't have memories." But then, things went wrong. Horribly wrong. And after 28 days, the family left the house and fled Amityville, never turning back.Of course, Jay Anson's novel was a bestseller. I've personally read it myself, and it's written well. But there are several different variations on what happened during those 28 days, even with George and Kathy Lutz. So, for those of you who know the story before you watch the movie, it's hard to distinguish what is and isn't true. Some of you may not believe it at all. However, I am one of those people that believe in this account of a suburban haunted house, after watching rather truthful and intelligent interviews with the Lutzes and other paranormal investigators. But aside from that, what matters most about "The Amityville Horror" is how it works as a movie.First of all, the setting means everything. Filmed in New Jersey, and not actually filmed in Amityville, the house is a particularly creepy abode to look at, especially during night scenes. Those two windows become a character all their own. They stare out into the night, and give the viewer the horrible feeling that they're being watched.Also, there is definitely enough paranormal activity going on to keep you interested. However, the ghostly phenomenon doesn't start right away. In fact, it builds sporadically, creating a wonderful sense of dread. If you can appreciate a good build-up without much special effects(until the dynamite ending), then you will probably like the movie.James Brolin and Margot Kidder are a joy to watch as George and Kathy Lutz. They are not perfect performances by far(there are moments when their performances go a little too over the top). But there are great things to see here between Brolin and Kidder. They have sincere moments together as husband and wife. Other times when things get frightening, their shock and fear comes off naturally. Then we are scared for George and Kathy. Basically, Brolin and Kidder give mostly good performances.We also have Rod Steiger's performance as Father Delaney to judge. Sandor Stern's script has limited this character, and therefore, Steiger is not in the movie too much, but he makes the most with the screen time he has. In fact, he makes the role larger, and we're not just scared for the Lutz family, but for him also.Obviously, some events in "The Amityville Horror" are slightly exaggerated when you compare them with the book's events or the perspectives of others who have experienced the haunting. But that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining. I look past its flaws, and embrace it for what it is: a cult classic that has gotten some damn good attention over the years. It's not a masterpiece, but I continue to love and believe in "The Amityville Horror."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective chiller about a strange house located in Long Island that causes creepy goings-on in a family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the classic version about the infamous Amityville house with lots of screams and weird deeds in which a family falls into supernatural terror . The story starts with a grisly mass murder ; years later , a family moves to Long Island where is purchased a Victorian home , their house of dreams but they find only devilish horror and full of nightmares . Longtime ago, there occurred a grisly mass killing based on an allegedly real life occurrence in Amityville that turns out to be a haven for demonic forces . And now a possessed father (James Brolin) is plunged by demonic forces into supernatural attitude driving him to mistreat and beat the kiddies . The wife (Margot Kidder) begins experiencing frightening and vivid dreams of killings . Meantime ,the father is attempting to find out the bottom of events by ways of the cellar . While , an exorcist priest (a hysteric Rod Steiger who steals the show as scene-chewing ) tries praying to vanquish the malignant spirit , staggering from room to room with the doors mysteriously slam . And soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks before deciding to utilize its powers to possess the father and attack the family .The film contains restless terror and great loads of gore and blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the curse and the usual ghastly shenanigans result to be the cracking pipelines , wall ooze icky stuff, flies swarm manifest as attackers, and doors suddenly slam , among others . It is produced with acceptable budget by Samuel Z Arkoff (AIP)and well recreated with high grade special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . It's actually halfway decent terror movie that achieved big success at the box office and it will appeal to ghostly and eerie events fonds. The picture packs a colorful cinematography by Fred Koenekamp and eerie musical score by Lalo Schifrin that will be used in the innumerable sequels . The original ¨Exorcist¨ film (by Friedkin) spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as ¨Changeling¨ (by Peter Medak), ¨Amytiville ¨(by Stuart Rosemberg) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Following a great number of clumsy, stupid sequels directed by Damiano Damiani , Richard Fleischer ,Sandor Stern ( screenwriter of Amityville), Anthony Hitchcock.. And the bad followings just go on and on attempting to cash in on the success of the first movie . However , recently is made a good new adaptation by Andrew Douglas with Ryan Reynolds (James Brolin role ) , Melissa George ( Margot Kidder character) and Philip Baker Hall (Rod Steiger), though this is a new take on from previous film, it's one of the highest earning horror movie of the last years and like the¨ Amityville ¨ original became a box office biggie . Rating : Aceeptable and passable .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror is about a large house on the coast of Long Island where newly weds George and Kathy Lutz and their three children move into the house that they hope will be their dream house but it ends up in terror.Despite full disclosure by the real estate agent of the home's history, George and Kathy buy the house. George says, "Houses don't have memories," but they turn to their family priest Father Delaney who believes the house is haunted and performs an exorcism on the house.But the evil spirit in the house causes him to become blind and makes him very ill.George and Kathy with the help of another priest Father Bolen and a police detective they face the fears of the house, but not knowing the spirit is planning to possess George and then the children...The story may or may not be true, but there is no denying the fact that the story is creepy and effective. James Brolin (who looks uncannily like Christian Bale) is great as Lutz, the man who is slowly being overwhelmed by the house.It's not a scary film to watch, in fact it's quite funny in some scenes, but it's just the after effect the film has, and it makes you think. Not much happens on screen, it's the fact that Lutz poses such a threat throughout the movie is what makes the film so tense.With great support from a very beautiful Kidder and Rod Steiger, the film is highly underrated, and is complimented by a very good remake too.Plus it includes the funniest vomit scene ever committed to film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regardless as to whether or not the story is true, The Amityville Horror is an underrated horror classic and the definitive haunted house movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Amityville Case is no doubt the most famous ghost story of all time. The case was fascinating, yet baseless as far as legitimate evidence goes and the novel was a huge success. It made the way for this 1979 film that was a box office hit that was ripped apart by critics. It doesn't matter whether or not you believe the story to be true because either way The Amityville Horror can be seen as a great horror film that has a fair few faults that restrict it from achieving the status of being amazing.The story is basic. Ronald DeFeo Jr murders his entire family in the middle of the night and his house is sold off to George and Kathy Lutz and their children a year later. What supposedly goes on during the next thirty days is a series of paranormal occurrences that eventually drive the Lutz family into sheer terror and influence them to abandon their dream home never to return.Maybe it isn't the most original plot ever, but it is efficient for the haunted house genre and the fact that it was based off of supposedly true events makes it more engaging. As a studier on the Amityville case, it was really interesting to see this film brought to life with accuracy to the claims of the real life Lutz family. Seeing what I read about at that time on the TV screen was actually really exciting for me, but as I've grown older and become more critical of films I am able to point out flaws that critics identified. Even though I still like this movie a lot, I can respect critics opinions on it since I see where they are coming from.Firstly, the acting is stiff. Margot Kidder and James Brolin aren't very good actors, and what's worse is that their chemistry is blunt and ineffective. This is sadly accentuated even more by the fact that some of the dialogue for the George and Kathy Lutz characters is cheesy and laughable ("You make me feel like a kid in the back seat of a car"). The fact that these two are the main characters is really off putting and it just draws your interest towards seeing creepy things happen in the house even more. However, I did quite like Rod Steiger's performance as the priest. I would have loved to see more of him in the movie.Another issue is the fact that the film moves rather slowly, especially in the middle. The film wastes a lot of time on unengaging drama and sometimes forgets that it is trying to be a haunted house movie. Also, at other times the editing came off as being amateurish and even laughable. These are salient flaws.As far as positives go, I'd like to commend the creepy atmosphere present in many scenes. The use of dark lighting in the house alongside the music was really effective and certainly made me fear the house. On top of that, the house looks just like the real house in Amityville. I also really love the fact that the filmmakers really put in the effort to present the Lutz family's claims on the big screen. The walls dripped with ooze, 'Jody' was often mentioned and briefly seen, George woke up at 3:00 AM all the time, the flies were appearing, supernatural voices were heard etc. It was great to see them make a film adaptation that was accurate to claimed events.Sure, The Amityville Horror isn't the best horror movie ever made, but outside of the glaring faults it can be viewed as the essential haunted house movie. It really doesn't matter whether or not the story is true. I recommend seeing it especially if you are a horror fan and avoid the letdown of the 2005 remake.8/10</fullReview>

Nothing in their so-called "haunted house' seems to match the documented accounts of true haunted houses.The movie proves it,the story is fiction.On the other hand,this neat little movie does set up a convincing psychological basis as James Brolin is slowly and methodically being driven mad by:a new marriage, obnoxious kids, a failing business, lack of money and then, just to push him over, a strange house and weird events.Great movie,great score [that nah-nah,nah-nah score would creep me out alone] and great build-up to a fevered ending. 9 out of 10 Stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the semi-true story of the Lutz family, "The Amityville Horror" tells the tale of a newlywed couple who move their nuclear family into a spacious and gorgeous house they purchased on the cheap. Things aren't quite as simple as they seem, as the previous tenants were all brutally murdered in their sleep by one of their own. This part of the story is true, this much we know. What follows is either a shared hallucination by the Lutz family, a clever scam, or an unexplainable phenomenon.While "The Amityville Horror" isn't quite on par with other classics of its era such as "The Omen" or "The Exorcist," it's still good for a few quality late-night scares. The special effects are pretty decent for their time, and even when they aren't achieved with the most sophisticated of means (see: eyes in the window) they still manage to send shivers down the spine. James Brolin and Margot Kidder play the unfortunate married couple and have enough on-screen chemistry to make the story believable. Brolin gives a performance so intense that the "South Park" boys likely fantasize about him going Amityville on Barbara Streisand. Kidder isn't given much to do other than act like a clueless hippie, but perhaps this is a trait carried amongst Lutz women. Rod Steiger appears as a priest who serves no other purpose than to slow down the plot. There is probably a good half-hour devoted to this character that could have been shaved off the final product, and the film would have been the better for it.The film is a slow-burner for sure. Unfortunately, what we get in the end is barely worth the 28-day build-up (2 hours for us). Common sense instills in us that leaving the house a few weeks earlier would have been the smart move, but I guess you just can't walk away from a "killer" deal, huh? The film inspired a slew of dumb sequels, some of which were admittedly more entertaining than their predecessor, as well as a Michael Bay-produced remake that is actually pretty good. It may not have held up as well as others from its time, but "The Amityville Horror" is an intriguing story that is worth re-visiting from time to time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1970's produced some great horror films. Classic horror staples like The Exorcist, Carrie, and Halloween came from this decade. However, the 1970's produced its fair share of cheap exploitation films that were a complete mockery to the genre which had such potential. Thankfully, The Amityville Horror is an example of the former. Coming in at the very end of the polarized decade, 1979 saw the disturbing and harrowing story of a family of five moving into an old country house, which they soon find out is possessed. One year before this family bought the house, the previous owners had been brutally murdered by a person with motives unknown. They seek the help of the church and their family priest, Father Delaney (Robert Steiger), but this only creates more problems as the horror grows into a creepy and exciting horror flick.Now the overhanging question on the mind of anyone who watches this film will surely be... why didn't the family just move the hell away? I thought about it and, honestly, the best answer I can come up with is, because there wouldn't have been a movie if they did. It can be a frustrating question, but if you let yourself get too caught up in it, it distracts from everything else about this movie that is really good. Sure it would have been nice if they had just quickly written in an answer to this question, and for all I know maybe they did and I just missed it. Either way, if you avoid getting caught up in this issue, it makes the film a lot better. Trust me.The Amityville Horror really does tell a great story, one which is allegedly based upon a true one. I'll take that tidbit of information with a hefty grain of salt (hooray for oxymorons) but I'm not here to speculate so... moving on. The story arc of this film stays plenty interesting the whole way through. It's got an ominously dark setup and quickly heads down a disturbing path to horror and insanity. All the characters are affected in one way or another by this house, and we get to see every moment of it. We get a great look into the spiraling insanity of this terrified family, as well as their friends, and especially Father Delaney, who must wage war against the possessed house as well as the church who won't believe a thing he tells them as he tries to save the family. The Amityville Horror succeeds in being subtly creepy for the majority of the film. The house is essentially alive, as it is possessed by a demon, and it is very impressive how much is accomplished through one intelligent architectural decision. The two windows on the front of the house may look harmless, but used in the right context they are extremely foreboding. There are plenty of shots of these two ominous windows, which are practically the insignia for this movie. Kudos need to be given to whoever decided on this look for the film that is wonderfully effective, without being overdone.A lot of what drives The Amityville Horror is the solid performances dished out by the lead actors. James Brolin (father of the very talented Josh Brolin) plays the father of the family alongside Margot Kidder, the mother. These two are great together and their chemistry moves perfectly throughout the film. At the beginning they are happy sunny newlyweds who are so eager to move into their own house to live the rest of their lives together in. Yet as the house takes hold of their psyches, we see them grow farther and farther apart as everyone begins to lose their mind and the true horror sets in. Rod Steiger, who could be considered a legend to some, plays his character of the family priest very well also. It is a slightly over-dramatic role, but Steiger captures it just right, so as to stay convincing the entire way through. Roles like these are often seen overplayed, but the cast of The Amityville Horror, play the parts at just the right level, making the film a much more convincing and exciting experience.Unfortunately, the lowest point of this film is the ending. It's abrupt and overdoes what should have been a consistently subtle horror. When the credits rolled I felt somewhat cheated and disappointed that it didn't pack a more solid punch than the misconstrued mess I received. It didn't kill the film by any means, and it didn't make me reconsider my opinion of the film, I just couldn't help but wish for more. An ending that was better thought out could have turned this good film into a great film, but whats done is done, and I still enjoyed The Amityville Horror a lot. It is a fine example of horror done well and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the classics of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Amityville Horror-1979</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to HMV one day and decided to buy a horror movie. I had heard all about Amityville Horror. It was always on TV, but I never had the interest to watch it. So I bought the 2000 MGM DVD for $9.99. The movie is about a couple that moves into a new house, but little do they know, it is haunted. All of this was apparently a true story. Wonderful acting by Rod Stieger. This movie is not really a horror movie. It does not have the chills of a horror movie. The reason I never watched it was because I heard it was a bit of a bore. This movie is not what you may think it is. Don't go buying this if you think you will get a really scary movie. The DVD has a great picture. Probably a step up from the VHS version. If you are interested in the story of Amityville, then go out and get it. Do not expect a movie with blood and gore, because this movie is almost free of it. The 2000 DVD version is a bit of a disappointment in terms of features. Only the trailer is included. There are 8 sequels.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the horror movies that gets as much as it can out of those "things that go bump in the night." A family of a woman with her two boys and one daughter and her recently wed husband move into a steal of a deal house where, oh by the way, a year ago a guy blew his parents and siblings away. The story is the story of the family that buys the house after the Defeo killings - the Lutzes. They were consultants on the film and their 28 days in the house serve as the basis for the script. Both now - strangely perhaps - are no longer with us having died in the mid-2000s. Anyway. The house it appears is haunted - perhaps a gateway to Hell or the place of an Indian burial ground or the property of a former Salem Witch. Who knows? But what I do know is that director Stuart Rosenberg who directed films like The Pope of Grenwich Village, Voyage of the Damned, and the awesome Cool Hand Luke along with mega-producer Samuel Z. Arkoff make one heck of an atmospheric film here and bring to the screen one of the most menacing, sessile monsters in film to us - the Amityville House. The house looks haunted and creepy. Rosenberg does a great job feeding that tension to the viewers with scenes that are subtle and then go way over the top. High production values( for an Arkoff film - I once heard him say this movie was one with which he had the most pride) and credible acting from leads James Brolin and a very perky and pretty Margot Kidder along with Don Stroud, Murray Hamilton, and Val Avery and a mega-performance from Rod Steiger as Father Delaney who goes out to the house and is treated to flies, voices, vomit, and a burning hand holding a phone later all make this film one worth seeing. Steiger is a slice of ham to be sure but his scenes were for me some of the most memorable if but for nothing more than his commanding voice with dubious dialog. The Amityville Horror is fraught with continuity issues and stretches of logic and relies way too heavily on feeling rather than story, but it stays afloat nonetheless and would spawn several sequels - none rivaling it in any category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Amityville Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a gruesome mass murder takes place in a big house in a nice neighbourhood, the house is sold for a very affordable price to the Lutzes, an average stepfamily of five. Soon after moving in, strange things start occurring: doors, windows and furniture move by themselves, strange sounds are heard and the family members start behaving oddly. Especially George (James Brolin), the stepfather, becomes sullen and brooding over a couple of weeks, upsetting his wife Kathy (Margot Kidder) and her kids. A local priest (Rod Steiger) also notices something gravely wrong about the house, but doesn't seem to be able to help the Lutzes despite his efforts. As the eerie incidents keep getting more and more distressing, how will the Lutzes cope with the situation?Based on Jay Anson's book about the experiences of the real-life Lutzes, the movie maintains a somewhat down-to-earth approach to the supposedly true story. It begins so slowly that I was already becoming quite disappointed with it, even though I'm generally supportive of creeping atmosphere in cinema. However, after a while it becomes obvious that it's actually better seen as a character study as opposed to horror: George's menacing change of nature can be seen as a reaction to the stressful life situation he's going through: raising a family, running a business, moving into a new house and getting the bills paid. The bearded James Brolin captures George's emotions very effectively, essentially carrying the whole film with his performance. Rod Steiger's character Father Delaney goes through an even more drastic phase of anxiety and Steiger plays the role with all the necessary intensity, especially during his desperate call for help in a degrading church. Margot Kidder's character receives less attention, but she does her job decently too.The film quickly leads thoughts to other religious horrors of the era, such as The Omen and The Exorcist, but also bears a resemblance to The Shining, even though the latter only came out after it. A theme of a family man slowly losing his mind and, more obviously, an axe-swinging finale are more fascinatingly handled in Kubrick's film, but The Amityville Horror reaches a decent amount of suspense at its best too. The music by Lalo Schifrin is perfectly in tune with the atmosphere and when it finally starts in the last minutes of the movie, the action looks OK as well. The very ending comes across as rather abrupt though, even though the last shot of the family's car from afar suits the mood well.In summary, I think The Amityville Horror is a watchable movie, but more so as a character study than a flat out horror. What the film loses in action and gore, it wins back in the actors' performances and music. When watched with this in mind, it may prove out to be an enjoyable experience, even if it's not ultimately quite as great as the horror classics mentioned in the previous paragraph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunted house infamy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the most infamous haunted house movie, this is alleged to be based on a true story, though how accurate that is is hard to tell.A seemingly perfect family, the Lutz's, move into a new house, fully aware that a grisly murder took place there. Despite the wife's reservations, Mr. Lutz explains that they would not have been able to afford the place were it not for the reluctance of others to inhabit the property.Well, it's not long before the brooding forces of evil still present in the house start to show their hand: a priest covered in flies, a mysterious sickness, a hand trapped in a window frame, a cupboard door that won't open. The tension builds to a dramatic conclusion as the family are forced to flee, to save their very lives.Muhahahahaha.Whilst the movie has dated quite badly, the storyline is still a powerful one, tapping into the most primal of fears: how can you be at peace, when even in your own home you do not feel safe and secure.The performances are all more than acceptable, and even the child actors do not grate too harshly, and Margot 'Lois Lane' Kidder looks decidedly foxy throughout, especially in her striped cheer-leader style skirt.Gimme an I. Gimme an N. Gimme an S. Gimme an A. Gimme an N. Gimme an E.Whilst not as creepy as I was hoping, and overly long, with a script that drags its heels in places, this is nevertheless an effective chiller, and it is easy to see why it spawned the seemingly never ending line of sequels.Yet to see the remake, though I've got it lined up, I enjoyed this movie more than I genuinely expected to</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find Horror's from this and last 2 decade's weak but this for me is a refreshing exception.The film is well produced and visually very effective as it conveys a feeling of conflict, hope, confusion and of course fear.Very good story line and most importantly...well acted so therefore.....convincing but if the whole package doesn't for some bizarre reason convince you then bare in mind that this film is based on a true story.The Film focuses on a young boy who has cancer and must be treated by his parents who make the daily journey from New York to Connecticut. (around 290 Miles)The daily drive to and fro starts to take its toll so common sense prevails and the parents look to rent a place near the hospital. They move in and are relieved and feel they've made good decision but Matt(the boy)starts to behave differently...he gets stranger, negative...maybe giving up hope but also darker by the day so the parents are very concerned and place him in hospital fearing for his mental state. I won't ruin the film but things get worse and worse and the parents in grief turn to church for help...anyway go get it, was very impressed by film...I love a good scare! You'll jump, heart will miss a few beats, be scared and of course entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair Adaptation of the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of us who read Jay Anson's book before seeing the film, the success of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR rather depends on how much of the book you believe, a question I have been wrestling with since 1977 and to this day I have not been able to decide. There is a lot left unexplained, not the least of which is the priest involved in the case actually going on record and talking about it on the television show "In Search Of..."; also the basic facts of the tale seem to be undisputed: That the Lutzes moved into the house in late December 1975 and fled twenty-eight days later, leaving all their belongings behind. Their property was later retrieved by a moving company but the Lutzes themselves never set foot in the house again after January 1976. This really remains the unanswered question, because nobody moves into a house that they bought for a bargain price only to leave in less than a month unless SOMETHING happened.The book attempts to make a connection between the Lutzes' experience in the house and the murders of the DeFeo family in the same house a little over a year previously; some mention is made of a physical resemblance between Ronnie DeFeo, who murdered his family, and George Lutz, but it's not very convincing. As for the rest, it's mostly your standard horror novel stuff; Anson's writing is persuasive but not compelling, and in the end we're left wondering what really happened.Now to the film. As an adaptation of the book, it is a decent picture, even quite good in some spots, though with James Brolin and Margot Kidder headlining the cast, this was definitely a B project from jump; the presence of Rod Steiger as the priest lends it a touch of class, but director Stuart Rosenberg allows him to overact shamelessly, making what should have been scary somewhat ridiculous. In point of fact it is Brolin and Kidder who acquit themselves fairly well here; Kidder is perfectly believable as the increasingly-terrified wife and mother, and Brolin in particular stands out as the house seems to be doing odd things to George's mind; his silences are at once eloquent and truly scary.Paradoxically, however, the film, while mostly faithful to the book, sort of works against itself in the credibility department, because all the horror movie clichés of time are in place. THE EXORCIST, remember, had created quite the sensation (and gave rise to a million copycats) a scant few years earlier, and at times some of the stuff that happens to the on-screen Lutz family tends to give the viewer a sense of déj? vu.There has been a LOT of controversy about this story, both as told in Anson's book and Rosenberg's film. At the end of the day, trying to decide if any of it actually happened is a frustrating business; there's a lot of contradictory testimony out there, but the basic fact that the Lutzes only lived in the house for twenty-eight days has not as far as I know been disputed, which leaves the obvious question: SOMETHING must have happened in that house, but WHAT? And we'll probably never know for sure. George and Kathy Lutz are both dead now, as is Jay Anson, and I have never come across any statements from Kathy's three children, so it is impossible to decide whether their parents made the whole thing up or they are just too freaked to talk about it.The film itself isn't bad, really. It would have been far better for all concerned had Anson's book (and this film) been marketed as fiction rather than fact; as a movie, it is an effective enough B style horror film, with an attractive and not untalented cast, and what few visual effects there are are pulled off both stylishly and convincingly. So perhaps the proper reaction to this story is to enjoy it for what it is and not to look for evidence of anything deeper than a good haunted house tale.Incidentally this thing was remade in 2005; that movie was so bad I didn't make it through the first twenty minutes.</fullReview>

Sure, it's a little fake, but come on! It's the seventies!In light of all the remakes of classic 80's films recently, I just want to say that they shouldn't be doing that. The subtlety and suspense has gone from movies. The atmosphere in this film is great, and it tells a story, another thing modern films has forgotten about.Overall this is a good, fun horror film that you'll enjoy.

		<shortDescription>Decent at best, but even the book was much better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: A slow-moving haunted house film that ain't the classic other say it is, but has its moments.It wasn't long before people realize that it was The Amityville Hoax, not The Amityville Horror, that has 'terrorized' audiences and readers of the story of the Lutzes flee from their seemingly harmless and perfect home at the coast of Long Island. But whether I believed it or not, fact or fake may it be, I both read the 'autobiographical' book by Jay Anson and saw the 1979 film adaptation based on the novel. Actually, I saw the film first, then by chance of curiosity, I purchased the novel of which the film was based on.The novel wasn't the finest piece of literature, and neither was it great or impressive on a technical level, but it was a decent page-turner trying to tell a story. I was thinking that reading the book may widen my appeal and understanding of the film (same thing I did with THE EXORCIST), which was muddled, pretty dull and mostly weak when it came to actually tell the story. It did, quite, make a few things clearer after reading the book. I bet it probably pays to read the print source first, since the movie, creepy and eerie it might have been (as a pure 70's film), doesn't really lay the point down. There's the story, but we got a little lost on the telling.Considered a classic, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR has severely dated, maybe because it wasn't exactly high-quality film-making when it was made back during the 70's. While it had a large hype upon its release, earning it a couple of bucks or so to make it a hit, the film is nothing different from a B-grade horror flick William Castle dreams up overnight. Cheap scare tactics and not-so-special effects are all tied up for one tame night at the horror drive-in. Not to mention the over-the-top to totally sub-par performances (Rod Steiger should be at least proud of himself, considering that the other performers were much worse than he was). But despite its datedness, there's a certain charm that drew me in THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, therefore it ain't that bad a film (even if, by today's standards, this is bad movie). The film is not without its redeeming qualities.But even in comparison, the novel was actually better. Other than a few changes with the character names (not that the names of "those involved" are already changed), the film is a short departure from the novel. The cheap scare tactics are there, only the book adding a sense of chill the film sorrily lacked (even if you see it back then or now). The characters were weak in the novel, hence nothing has much changed in the film. I slightly recommend THE AMITYVILLE HORROR for some revisiting, but I guess reading the novel first may prove to be a better excursion.Rating: *** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cult movie based on supposed true events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from a book that is claimed to be based on true events, AMITYVILLE HORROR is the movie that tells us the story of Lutz family, which supposedly experienced paranormal phenomena in an old house on Amityville.As far as I learned, the film just follows what was described by the Lutz family, as it was a report of the events. Even so, there are some holes in the plot that are a bit not understandable (For example: when they found the red room, why didn't they explore it a little more? They acted as it had no importance, after discovering it!) This film is a classic, a cult movie, but, even not remembering of the dated production which has some natural clichés of the 70's horror films, I think it should be better to earn that "status". Mentioning some of the reasons to this appreciation I can refer the acting, which could have been a little better in my point of view, or even the lack of great suspense scenes!I will score this film with some extra score because of its accuracy to the supposed "true events", because as a movie itself I found it nothing special?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Haunted House Story Based Loosely On Real Life Events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror is a supernatural film with ties to real life events based on the murderer Ronald DeFeo, who confessed to killing his entire family(6 members in all)while they slept with a high-powered rifle. Once captured, facing murder charges, DeFeo told authorities that the malevolent force of an evil spirit spoke to him and controlled him while he murdered each family member. He tried to use the insanity plea but was ultimately found guilty of 6 first-degree murder charges and sentenced to 150 years in prison.The film itself uses other events that supposedly happened to another family that lived in the house. Claims were made, by the Lutz family, that the evil in the house told them to leave and after 28 days of living there, they did just that. So the stage was set for a haunted house movie that was hailed as being "Based on True Events." As a movie, The Amityville Horror is one of the better and well known haunted house films of all time. It has spawned several sequels and a remake in 2005. While it is your typical haunted house movie, its ties with the real-life murders by Ronald DeFeo and the claims by the Lutz family is intriguing enough to keep your interest throughout. This is a solid supernatural film well worth the 2 hours of viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody knows the story of 112 Ocean Avenue, a three-story Dutch Colonial home in Amityville, New York. However, most believe that the only awful thing that happened there that's actually true is the night Ronald DeFeo, Jr. murdered his entire family there, claiming he was possessed. A year later George and Kathy Lutz, and Kathy's three children moved into what they thought was the home of their dreams. Almos a month later they fled and told of hearing voices, feeling an unusual cold that wouldn't go away, seeing demons, etc. Now I don't want to get into whether or not I believe their story and why or why not, but I will say this: It's a really frightening story either way. As for the 1979 film based on the bestseller by Jay Anson, it was great for it's time and made a nice chunk of money. Today it's just a pretty good haunted house movie. Nothing more, nothing less.Pros: The score by Academy Award winning composer Lalo Schifrin is both elegant and eerie. Excellent performances by the two leads and the supporting cast. Moves at a slow, but steady pace without any bumps along the way. Late director Stuart Rosenberg does a good job of giving the movie a feeling of doom by using filters and keeping the house nice and dark. Plenty of goosebump-inducing moments and images. Instead of using a lot of elaborate effects and set-pieces the filmmakers use subtlety and atmosphere to scare the viewer. Nice cinematography, including beautiful shots of New Jersey in Autumn.Cons: Some subplots, like the one with the detective for example, are either dropped or not fleshed out well. Rod Steiger's performance is over-the-top to the point of embarrassment. Though there are some chilling scenes and happening, this film is nowhere near as terrifying as the book or other films of this kind. They should have upped the ante in terms of scares.Final thoughts: May not be as effective as it was in the time it was released, especially after all the talk of the events being a hoax, but if thought of as just a haunted house movie you might find it to be a minor treat. It's also better than most of it's sequels and even the 2005 remake, which sadly strayed even further from the superior novel. Watch this one with the lights off and see if you can make it through.My rating: 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think people are a little too hard on this movie for reasons unknown to me. It is a "good" horror flick compared to those that we have today. The movie leaves you wondering if the horror contained inside the house is the house itself, an old Indian Chief, the evil from the murders or hell itself. Most people don't believe the story is true, obviously even if something happened to the Lutz's, Hollywood stretched the story even more to make the film. I don't necessarily believe in the supernatural but shouldn't we all have an open mind? The best I can put it is what it as just a movie, nothing more.

		<fullReview>I first saw AMITYVILLE as a horror-loving 12-year-old, steeped in the Hammer films, Universal monsters, ghost stories, and all the atomic monsters you can imagine. This movie scared me then, and still feels creepy today. The stark, cold New England setting, Lalo Schifrin's score (still brings chills), and the less-is-more imagery do it for me. For it's day, it really did it. What it leaves up to the audience to fill in is just right for the most part, but some connections in the material, as translated to film, are tenuous. Thought they should have either dropped the late night stupor of the George character or somehow shown what happened to him. Thought the treatment of Jodi was right on, and still gives me the willies. Anyway, happened to catch it the other day and remembered why it's stuck with me all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much maligned but actually quite effective demonic chiller of the late '70s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's main problem is that it came out at the wrong time. In 1979, the age of the slasher flick was at hand: body-counts were racing up, blood was suddenly spattering our movie screens. As a result of which, one of this film's strengths ? its subtle approach to the horror ? became unfairly identified as its main weakness.There are certainly technical faults on show. The investigating policeman thread leads nowhere, Rod Steiger overacts terribly as the tortured priest, Father Delaney, and the final appearance of the demon ? so frightening in the book ? is jettisoned in favour of a much less satisfying finale.But otherwise, the slow-burn atmosphere works very well. The idea that there's something utterly evil yet at the same time intangible in the Amityville house is far more frightening than the glib, cartoon-like explanations offered in the 2005 remake. There's also a feeling of authenticity. Modern accounts of haunting suggest that the main effects on people so afflicted is sickness and disorientation. Those who are genuinely supposed to be possessed go through personality changes and become tired and ill-tempered, rather than turning into leering, Nicholsonesque maniacs. All of this is reflected here.The dreary Autumnal setting, while it isn't OTT, creates a sensation that these people are alone, that their lives have suddenly taken a turn for the worse, that time is running out for them, while Schifrin's understated score has now become a classic in the history of horror movies.Something this film is often accused of is looking like a TV movie, and in some respects that may be true, but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment. This is no roller-coaster ride full of special effects and ghoulish monsters; it's more like a documentary analysis of a real-life haunting, which at the time many viewers believed it was. And on that level it hits the mark. If only they hadn't stuck with that rather lame, uneventful ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't buy beautiful homes that have been abandoned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing I've learned in life that is: if it sounds to good to be true then it usually is. A big beautiful house in the country for an amazingly low price... what's the catch? Oh, it's just haunted that's all. I'd have to put Amityville Horror amongst the top scary movies. I know that I am far from an authority on scary movies (they are usually 3rd or 4th on my list of genre when renting a movie) but I have seen enough horror films to know a good one, and Amityville Horror was good. Even better is that although the movie was made in 1979, I didn't even see it until 2006 and I still liked it. I usually judge scary movies by how much it can startle me or frighten me without excessive blood and gore. Amityville Horror really gave me the feeling that the house had an ominous presence. George Brolin did an excellent job in his role, and I liked that it was never revealed what exactly was in the house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first stumbled upon the story of Amityville at a young age, so was aware of it's content prior to watching. The film does it's disturbing true story justice.I then watched the remake starring Ryan Reynolds, and i have to say, was greatly disappointed. The beauty of the original is its honesty. The remake, however,sadly only finds time to delve straight into over-dramatising the entire plot, making it just another modern day horror which will soon be forgotten. I found the only upside to be Ryan Reynolds displayed without clothing often.Of course, I could be wrong in my judgement; the other people watching both films with me agreed the remake was above it's previous candidate. However, for me, this 70's version is the definite master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly good haunted house horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haunted house movies seem to be tricky. Most of them stink. An obvious highlight is The Haunting (1963, not the remake) and a film called The Legend of Hell House, a British chiller I find immensely enjoyable and suspenseful. It just seems to be a very difficult task at making a house all that creepy.The Amityville Horror scared the living daylights out of me when I was a kid. When the house said "Get out" I did, the living room anyway. But many years, and horror films, later I could make it through the film without it giving me nightmares. I found out that it's actually not that scary. But still I find it pretty good and I always enjoy it, multiple viewings don't ruin it for me.It's got a very creepy beginning. When the house's history is revealed early on, the creepy mood is set in motion and is admirably sustained for most of it's screen time. The side story, involving Rod Steiger as the Priest, is mostly worthless and should have been scaled down (the one thing that the remake did better). But overall the eerie atmosphere is well handled, the house does take on a personality (those eyes still stay with me) and there are some genuinely creepy moments floating around. Of course the ending is a let down, every haunted house movie except for The Haunting doesn't seem to know exactly how to end on a high note.I've always thought that James Brolin was pretty underrated in his day. He's a fine actor and gives a good performance here. His descent into madness is well handled.Overall I think The Amityville Horror is a very decent horror film, it's certainly better than the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's creepy enough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror is one of the first haunted house/possession stories. It's not a brilliant film but I think it is good enough to be regarded as a horror classic. It has a few creepy moments but most of the scares are quite hokey and dated.Most people would have heard of the "true" story of the Amityville house that was supposedly cursed and caused the previous occupants to move. Well, this is what this movie is about. The Lutz family move in to the house that holds a very interesting and horrific past. Soon after they move in there are many strange occurrences and George (James Brolin) starts to lose it.The Amityville Horror, although not spectacular film-making, is a fairly good horror movie. I think what really stands out is the cinematography, which is fantastic. The house really looks creepy and the director uses that to his advantage. The acting is a little poor, but it's not too horrible to watch. There are a few genuinely creepy scenes but the movie does lack a few things to make it a truly great 70's horror film.3/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think most people know what The Amityville Horror is about, so I won't go into the plot. I will only say that it is based on a true story.And when I say based, I mean LOOSELY based on a true story. I am a ghost investigator and I have spoken personally to one of the investigators on the case.A lot of the paranormal events depicted in the movie were accurate, some were almost accurate, and some were just made up to make the movie scarier.Even though I only gave this movie a 6, I did like it. I just don't think it's a great movie. It tries too hard to be scary. It relies too much on the special effects to move the plot along. The script was week, and I didn't like how they minimized the role of Ed and Lorraine Warren in the case. I know enough about the Warren's to know that they would NEVER abandon someone who needed help, and that's what it seems like happens here.Bottom line, this is a good movie, but not a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning of the film, there was an excellent full shot of the house standing through the evening and coming into the morning.I just LOVED that Sephia vision of the house! Those third-story windows looked like EYES! Spooky. And at 3:15 a.m. on the 13th of November 1974 , the De Feos were shot by their 23 year old son, Ronnie De Feo Jr.One year later, a family called the Lutz were shown around the house and they decided to buy it. Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) was married for the second time. And the the house was a full house and they bought for $8000.One month later, the Lutz settled into their dream home. And when a priest named Father Delaney (Rod Steiger)came to bless the house. He went upstairs into the room on the right. Suddenly, flies started to buzz around the window and the door slammed. And when Delaney began to bless the room, he felt noxious and flies buzzed everywhere and they covered him. And then, the door opened and he heard someone say: "GET OUT!" And he did, he went outside and he vomited! That night, when Father Delaney called the Lutz residence, the phone broke up and Delaney mysteriously got burnt. 4th day, Thusday. Mrs. Lutz could sense something was around, but she couldn't see it. And when Amy appeared, she said she had a friend named Jody. And when Aunt Helena (Irene Dailey) came over, Mr.Lutz and the kids were wondering why all the toilets had a smelly substance which poured out when flushed! Back down stairs, Helena walked under the chandeliers and they tinkled, she then shot out of the house, drove off, stopped the car and she vomited.6th day, Saturday. Father Bolan (Don Stroud) and Delaney were driving and the steering wheel locked, the bonnet flew open and then they crashed! This happened due to a fly which came from the house was in the car. And when the Lutz family when to Jimmy's (Marc Vahanian) wedding, Amy was left at home with her babysitter, Jackie (Amy Wright). And when Amy went into Amy's closet to get her pajamas. The rocking chair began to rock and then, Jackie was locked in the closet by the invisible Jody. At the wedding, Mr.Lutz fell ill and he and the family decided to split. And when they returned home, Mr.Lutz heard Jackie screaming in the closet and when he let her out, she looked awful! You have to see it! Jackie said that she was locked in, but there was no lock! And Amy said that Jody wouldn't let her let Jackie out.8th day, Monday. Delaney told the Head Priest about Ronald DE Feo and how he killed his family due to hearing voices in the house. Delaney also heard the voices. 11th day, Thursday. Carolyn (Helen Shaver). And when Carolyn saw the house, she thought it was creepy. And it was psycho seeing Gregory's (K.C Martel) hand being slammed down by a window. And soon, Mr.Lutz began to change! And when George woke up at 3:15 a.m. , he went into the sowing room and he saw flies buzzing around the open window. And when he tried to close it, the basement door began to move and when George was able to close the window, the front door broke open! And when Kathy and George went downstairs and saw the door, George went back upstairs into the sowing room, the flies were gone.And George found his dog Harry scratching the basement wall and he wouldn't leave it alone.12th day, Friday. And then she said that Jody wanted them to live there forever so she and Jody can play together. And in the evening, Kathy was listening to Amy singing a son. And when Kathy came in, Amy said that Kathy scared Jody and she went out the window. And when Kathy went to the window, she heard a grunt and a pair of pigs eyes! And not so soon, George felt the wall in the basement, there was something there. He found the passage to hell. And when Harry was alone in the basement, he went up the stairs and growled. And when Kathy and George went into the sowing room, they found the cross upside down! And they went room from room, blessing the house. And when they entered the sowing room again, the cross dropped by a force and when Kathy touched the cross, it was cold! 17th day, Wednesday. As Bolan and Delaney prayed in the church, the angel's face from the ceiling began to crumple each time when Delany said: "Give them health of mind and body that they may do your will with perfect love!" And then, Delaney went blind and the angel was as good as new.And on the 18th night, Thursday. George heard drumbeats coming from the lounge and when he entered the lounge. The noise stopped. 19th day, Friday. Kathy discovered bloody teeth marks on George's foot. And on the final night, Kathy came home and she looked for George and the kids. And when George came out of the boathouse with an Axe, he saw Jody at Amy's window! And when George looked for Amy, the walls began to bleed.Amy was hiding with Gregory and her other brother Matthew (Meeno Peluce) in the attic.And suddenly, the basement floor blew up and a lightning bolt hit one of the attic's window's. The house began to rumble and when George went to go get Harry, he wen down the stairs of the basement , they broke and he fell into a huge pool of blood. And Harry helped George out of the muck and George broke through the window with a chair and he took Harry with him. And the family took off abandoning their house and their belongings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this film because it creates a subtle setting of discomfort and uneasiness without over stimulating the viewer. Compared to Legend of Hell House, Amityville more so takes it's time to scare the viewer by building up the anticipation of whats going to happen to the family. During the film you are given small doses of paranormal activity that eventually lead to the rather "gory" ending (IE the blood starting to spill from the walls and stairs) which only causes the family to leave the house for good without so much as a care in the world to retrieve their belongings; The evil in the house did that good of a job at scaring them. I like Amityville Horror and will continue to recommend it to those wanting a good "based on a true story" ghost film. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For God's Sakes Don't Watch This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true example of a bad movie. Absolutely everything in this movie is bad and at times even worse. Like all bad horror movies a lot of the stuff is just a very poor imitation of things used in better films. (THE EXCORCIST, THE HAUNTING etc.) It's pretty much like they took every annoying horror movie cliche and then compacted them together into this film. Everything is handled at the most simplistic and obvious level. It's good vs evil theology is handled on the mindset of a first grader. Any sophisticated viewer will laugh at it's very heavy handed approach. It's also missing the one ingredient that makes any haunted house movie good and that is atmosphere. This film simply does not have any of it. It's all flatly photographed and mechanical. When the 'scares' do happen they rapidly become more and more fantastical and over the top. Eventually it just loses all credibility. It ends up looking like some out of control sci-fi film than a horror movie. The film is based on the book which is based on the dubious claims of the Lutz family who lived in the house for a very short time in 1975. It is interesting to note that the actual house was built in 1926 and was lived in for four and half decades without any report of any paranormal activity. Also since the house was 'abandoned' by the Lutz family in early 1976, it has been lived in by several different owners and none of them have reported any unusual activity either. The house stills stands at it's same location, but it's very pronounced attic windows have been altered to avoid the occasional curiosity seeker. The house used in the movie is located in New Jersey. Those attic windows have also been altered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original controversial haunted house movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the book depicting events that took place following the actual case of the 1974 Ronald Defeo murders of the New York suburban town of Amityville. George and Kathy Lutz and family move into their dream home and subsequently fall victim to paranormal forces that seem to be demonic in nature, and aggressive and violent incidents plague the poor family and their psychological well-being. Fans and skeptics doubt the credulity of the Lutz family's claims, but this film sparked an interest in the paranormal that is historically relevant.This was a time (1979) when haunted house films of this nature had a substantial impact on our culture due to a fear of the unknown that has not quite developed into what it is today with countless paranormal reality T.V. shows like "Ghost Hunters" and "The Haunted". Margot Kidder and James Brolin are sympathetic as the unbeknownst couple who must struggle with the past experiences of their home's previous occupants and the angry forces that may continue too inhabit it. Most of the plot devices seem quite clichéd for today's audiences, including bleeding walls, demonic voices crying "get out!!", and an unforgettable scene with priest, Rod Steiger attacked by flies and forced out of the home by the malevolent presence. With all inconsistencies and haunted house clichés aside, this is late 70's horror at its hammy best, with a very creepy musical score and overall unsettling ambient feel that continues to entertain paranormal and demonology enthusiasts to this day. The history of the "true" story behind the Defeo murders is undeniably scary, and the performances are convincing enough. The house with its second story windows looking like animalistic eyes is creepy in itself, and its' suspense is overwhelming. Fans of old school haunted house films will consider this a classic, newer generation ghost story seekers may find it boring and dated. Nevertheless, its a historical film-making experience with a solid cast and a thought-provoking argument between parapsychology, religion and reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror is a supposedly frightening but actually rather hilarious account of what might have happened to George And Kathleen Lutz when they moved into the Defeo house at Amityville, Long Island with their 3 children. Rather than fleeing in terror from their new home after 28 days, plagued by demonic presences, they obviously succumbed to an almost unrelenting assault of bad acting.Indeed in the movie version of the famous fictional, sorry, true story, virtually all the protagonists get their own turn at swallowing the scenery.Exhibit A. Rod Steiger, once famed method actor, deservedly awarded an Oscar for In The Heat Of The Night, screams about HOW EVIL THE HOUSE IS (sorry but I need a much bigger font-size to convey it. Rod here makes William Shatner looked restrained.Exhibit B. Margot Kidder "ARRRGGGHHH! SHE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD!!!!". Margot is a very good actress. She doesn't deserve this.Exhibit C. James BROLIN - "I'M COMING APAAARRRRT!" Poor Jimbo, spending almost the entire film polishing his axe, getting up a 3:15 am, and generally looking like a half-drowned Yeti. Margo at least has a half undressed calisthenics scene, which is about the only thing worth watching in the entire movie.Please look out for a cameo from what looks like a papier mache Miss Piggy. Hellish? I've seen better puppets from an infant school art class. Oh, yeah, there's also a puking nun. Who later plays basketball. Steiger's priest-character also upchucks, before acting like a flypaper advert, going blind, and wearing a Jedi Knight costume. Nice one, Rod.The only ghosts you're likely to find in Amityville are those of disgruntled estate agents/lawyers and paranormal investigators who let a fortune slip through their fingers. Jay Anson's book on which the film is based is actually rather good, although the whole thing is FICTION. If you believe it's a true story you really need to get out more...There have been about 142 sequels to this film. Are they all true as well? One saving grace - great music score from Lalo Schifrin. The rest of this movie is pretty dire.</fullReview>

Now with their and their souls in danger, the Lutzes must leave their supposed dream house or stay victim to it's terrifying power This film starred James Brolin, Margot Kidder &amp; Rod Steiger.In my opinion this was a very good film it makes you think if there were supernatural occurrences happening at 112 ocean avenue i have read the book and seen all of The Amityville films some of them are a bit stupid but I like them overall.****/***** very good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the very few Horror Films that you may see people be bipolar around. Tons hate it, tons love it. Me? I didn't hate it, but I didn't care for it all. My main problem with Amityville Horror is that it's way too boring. It often moved like molasses for me. The house is creepy enough by itself, that it doesn't need a whole lot of other theatrics. But a consistent pace would have certainly helped matters. There is always suspension of disbelief when it comes to Horror movies, but I had trouble with a lot of the stuff that commenced in this movie. Why did the family take so long to stay in that house? I would have been gone at the first sign of trouble. Could Rod Steiger have been any more hammier as the priest? I dig intensity, but don't overact with it. It was embarrassing. The little subplot between the priests just didn't interest me. The good thing about this movie is the two leads. James Brolin is the reason I stuck with this movie as long as I did. That epic beard to go along with his creepily intense show was great stuff. The Brolin rocks! I've always dug Margot Kidder, despite her reputation. She played the caring wife to a T. Final Thoughts: Boring and overlong to boot. The only reason to see this is James Brolin's terrific performance. I would recommend the remake over this one. It's not great, but at least it's fairly entertaining. This is a mediocre film with very little entertainment or thrills4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie can serve as a lesson. Never marry a woman with three kids who then makes you change your religion and then have you move into a home that is the scene of a murder. Well all kidding aside this movie was just okay. I am guessing it made over eighty million because people thought it was a true story. Not that it was bad, but it really was not a very graphic haunted house movie and it does not even stand out all that much. For what it was though I enjoyed it. It has this couple and they buy the house...apparently when discussing houses with their realtor they never asked the realtor to not show them houses possessed by Satan. They move in and a bunch of weird stuff starts to happen. First, their priest has a strange experience in their house. After this though the priest keeps turning up and I have to agree with the one reviewer he seems kind of pointless. After the fly scene there was no need for him in the rest of the movie. They could have just written him out by having him have a conversation with the mother and saying he was sorry, but there was nothing he could do. There was also a police chief that seemed to be doing something, but it never came to anything. Most of the movie it is just subtle things happening here and there with something a bit major happening every now and then. Brolin is a bit bland at first, but as the movie goes he seems to become a bit more insane. All in all a rather good movie that does not do anything to rough other than this one dream sequence. I am guessing that is the main reason it was R. Unless Kidder got naked at some point, I would not have seen that as I watched it on AMC. The ending is kind of anticlimactic, but not to bad. I guess they wanted it believable rather than shocking, though I was surprised when he went back for the dog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Haunted Houses are done right, they are down right scary. When they are special effects laden, the suck. Amityville Horror is done right. This film has lots of atmosphere and the dark hallways, creepy voices and strange happenings make it quite chilling. The camera work is very well done too. Although I have to admit that I would agree with Eddie Murphy when he did his standup routine about this film. I would have been out of there as soon as the blood came out of the taps. I have seen too many horror films by now and that would just be a dead give away. Brolin and Kidder are good in their roles. Brolin slowly disintegrates into madness and it is his metamorphisis that is key to the film. We change along with him as he discovers all the nasty things about the house. The house has a personality of its own and it should be one the stars of the movie. Amittyville Horror is very creepy and it should be seen again after all these years. From voices, to bugs, to "Judy" to madness, this film does an excellent job of spooking us all out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A horror film based on the novel about a house so evil the Luz family had to leave their home in terror.A newly married couple moves into their new home only to experience strange events unfolding every day as the house becomes alive and tries to swallow them whole.What made this truly unique is how it sets a sense of dead from the walks that bleed to the creaky noises in the night until it becomes a whirlwind of frights that don't stop until the credits roll. Kidder and Brolin have excellent chemistry making their marriage feel realistic and full of wild passion.The music was sensational haunting and has contempt for the audience.The themes keep you interested on a human level as you see a family try to fit in a new surrounding, to form a new family and deal with personal demons not covered in marriage counseling. It shares many similarities to Halloween in this regard to characters you root for, a scary house, Mr. Luz being driven crazy until he considers murdering his family.While the story is up for debate on rather it really happened or not and bashed by naysayers as a fake not worth taking seriously it is a tale of horror. A classic to enjoy every Halloween.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came up with an idea. I'm going to watch all the old "Amityville horror"-movies. And they're not that bad. I started up with the first one and here's my review:"The Amityville Horror" (1979) is a story about a family, who moves to a new house. Weird thing start happened to the family. Things no one can explain. It is really enjoyable to watch a movie like this. It have an atmosphere, which horror movies from the 70's and 80's have. You're not gonna find a movie today with the same atmosphere. And that's a shame. I call those movies: "Classics". And it is a horror classic. If you're a movie fan like me, you just have to watch movies like: "Gone with the wind" or "Ben-Hur" just to come up with some examples. If you're talking about 'Horror classic' you're talking about "The Exorcist" or The Texas chainsaw massacre" and especially "The Amityville Horror" This movie just stand through from beginning to the ending. It had a little flop in the middle, but the ending lifted it up. The performances is just amazing. James Brolin killed the role as George Lutz, which is the father in the family. He performed so good. You could really feel his passion and how he felt. The other performances was also pretty good. But none of them was as good as James Brolin. Compared to the movie is more than 30 years old, the effects was pretty good. It had scary moments where you sitting close to the screen and almost screaming to them. I can only recommend this movie to all, who loves a good Horror classic. It is one of the better horror movies to date."The Amityville Horror" gets 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I assume that audiences in the 1970s were na?ve and easily scared. Between The Omen and this garbage traipsing in at the end of the decade it boggles my mind they are both so popular. I pair them together as they sort of share similar themes and prey upon weak minds to buy into their nonsense.There is truth to the Amityville Horror, but there is a LOT of conjecture and immeasurable amounts of fabrication. Yes, murders did take place there and the Lutz family who moved in afterwards claim that the hauntings they experienced were real, and they took that claim to their graves. The Lutz family signed off on allowing Jay Anson to write a novel based on their experiences only for him to embellish it with fiction. This movie is based on that book but further expands it with pure fantasy. Calling this awful film "based on truth" is like saying that The Human Centipede is based on Winnie the Pooh.The fictional George and Kathy Lutz move into 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, New York and hope to start a new chapter in their lives. But as soon as a priest (played by Rod Steiger who apparently has no idea he's slumming it in a static horror film) comes around to bless the place a poorly ADR-ed voice tells him to "GET OUT!". Not taking well to being menaced by amateurishly dubbed-on dialogue the priest flees the house and hides in the church while the movie infrequently cuts back to him overacting so outrageously it seems straight out of a Carry-On film.George and Kathy are puzzled why no contact can be made with Father Steiger. Little do they know it's because of "ghost powers" messing up the phone line. Their youngest child makes friends with an invisible pig called Jodie while George develops a bit of a short temper. The extent of the haunting doesn't push past this for much of the two- hour running time, a length this material (fiction or not) simply cannot sustain. Towards the end the walls bleed and crosses on the wall go upside down. Wow! Scary! George also cannot find money that's been lost in the living room. This would be low-wattage drama even for a 1970s episode of Crossroads.On the final night George goes mad and preempts The Shining by hacking through the bathroom door with an axe while his wife and children panic. He comes to his senses, they flee, but not before George gets gunged in a remarkably unterrifying moment straight out of Noel's House Party.The Lutz family have never went into detail about what really happened on that final night, but ANYTHING would have been better than this. There is so much opportunity to make a frightening and classic horror film out of this premise and it's all fumbled by hack director Stuart Rosenberg who handles the material with all of the credibility of a cheap TV movie. The "house with eyes" motif is all he has going for him and boy does he overdo it. The atmosphere is flat and boring when the true story had much more potential. We see Ronald Defeo murder his family in the beginning, a scene which is correctly labelled as being November 1974. Then we cut to one year later when the Lutz family examine the house. Then we cut ahead another month to the correct date of December 1975 for their brief 28-day tenure. The movie is clearly shot during an Indian summer, the Christmas atmosphere is non- existent. What a joke! Stuart Rosenberg just wanted a paycheck, the actual quality of the movie meant nothing to him.The Amityville Horror is a drag - a boring, amateurish slog through unimaginative horror tropes that seem quaint and dated by today's standards. It should rightly be forgotten, though as George Lutz himself said, when compared to the 2005 Michael Bay film the 1979 camp-fest is like a "goddamn documentary".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Horror Flick!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger star in this 1979 horror film based on the book. This begins on a rainy night with a family being murdered. One year later, we meet George (Brolin) and Kathy Lutz (Kidder) who move into the same house with their 3 young children where the terrible incident took place. Soon, strange things occur and George starts behaving differently. George and Kathy discover that their house is haunted by an evil spirit of one of the deceased family members trying to possess them. The late, Steiger (End of Days) plays Priest, Father Delaney. This is a good horror flick with a decent cast and creepy effects. I recommend this for horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat overblown and overrated effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After moving into a new house together, a woman grows increasingly concerned about her husband's new behavior around and comes to believe their new house is haunted forcing her to find a way of stopping it from continuing.On the whole this is one of the more overrated efforts in the genre. There's not a whole lot here that works, and nearly all of that is tied in with the different supernatural antics on display which are only mildly suspenseful and thrilling. As the most notorious scene here for a reason, the encounter in the room with the flies manages to work incredibly well as the progressing swarm around his face and the louder buzzing get great suspense built up within here which naturally sets up the booming evil whispers which really comes off as creepy and chilling as possible. Elsewhere, other scenes here that come of nicely are all in the finale, from the howling voices and demented workload trying to get out of the basement as the growing pit and spackled wall coming down are off-set with the realization of the creepy back-story and the action to get away which is pretty much all that works here, along with the overall look and appearance of the house for the film's positives. There's a few flaws here that makes this one very troubling, most of which is tied in the film's insistence that his activities are chilling when they're really not. From his constant complaining about being cold, to constantly chopping firewood, snapping angrily at her, the kids, family or anyone around him and turning everything around him into the biggest deal doesn't come off as scary despite being set-up as the main scares here, as well as being boring and quite unimpressive at building an interesting story. This carries into the rest of the scare attempts here which are just as bland and boring by focusing on utterly non- threatening scare attempts as everyone here claims something's off about the house but nothing is done to ensure that these are creepy since everyone simply mentions something but is never paid off. Others are brought up and simply ignored, which makes them questionable inclusions as well, all furthering the fact that there's absolutely nothing that should keep the family in the house as long as what happens here and should've forced them out sooner regardless of how effective they are as scares. These here are what hold this down.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Brief Nudity, a long but very mild sex scene, and Adult Language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's certainly a lot to admire, but the repetitive and tedious nature of the narrative was a problem for me (and may be a problem for others)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amityville Horror gets off to a rather clichéd start where our fairly average suburban family move into their new home (James Brolin and Margot Kidder complete with 2.4 children). However, soon after they move into the house strange things begin to happen which not only affect many of those within the immediate family, but also to several other people who visit the house.I'll be honest here and say that I'm probably over-selling this when I say that anything happens 'soon' in this film, because let's face it it doesn't. The biggest problem with this film is that the narrative for the most part is tedious and repetitive. Our family move into the house and we're treated to many minor creepy/shock moments which is all well and good, but these moments seem to do very little to advance the story and there are many occasions when the film seems like it's stuck in some kind of loop. Even though the narrative is the weakest part of the film, the writers do enough to keep you involved in the proceedings by at least making many of the characters interesting and for the most part more than one dimensional. Amityville Horror has many moments where it is very creepy and I'll admit that this film passed my own Horror film test (that feeling where you get that shudder down your spine). I think the main reason this film worked for me is that it used the characters and their experiences to create the scares rather than just using cheap tricks such as slamming a door or having an evil being appear out of nowhere (this is something that seems to plague many recent horror films and I'm glad that the writers didn't go down that road).The biggest selling point with this film lies with the acting; firstly, I thought Brolin was fantastic; whether he was playing the every day family man, or the psychotic man possessed by the demons he was simply terrific - he had a crazy convincing look in his eye that few actors seem to be able to pull off. Margot Kidder was also great and very convincing in her respective role.Going back to problems and one must ask themselves if this film really needed to be nearly 2 hours; I honestly feel that films of this nature should run somewhere between 80 and 100 minutes and the elongated running time of this film isn't helped by what appears on screen; Day 1... Day 5.... Day 8... Day 12.... Yawn!! Face Palm. Give me a break. This demon wants them out of the house, but it takes nearly 3 weeks for the family to finally up and leave. Really?Even though I've panned this a lot I have to admit that there is an awful lot to enjoy; the characters are interesting, the film is very creepy for the most part, there's never a dull moment and the performances from all that are involved are excellent. I'll be honest and admit that I even found the house to be creepy (although it was probably a selected filming location for that very reason).Yes, this is a flawed film, but when it's good it's very good and the good far outweighs the bad. It's not perfect, but it's far better than lot of the rubbish that we see nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy haunted house classic and one of the genre's most effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for a good old-fashioned haunted house movie and THE AMITYVILLE HORROR is one of those all right ? with the added frisson of being (supposedly) based on a true story! It's a film made at the tail-end of the 1970s replete with that fine '70s atmosphere. And atmosphere is what this film is all about; it creates a truly sinister look and feel as it depicts what happens to the innocent Lutz family after they move into a house that was the site of a previous massacre. From the title cards telling us the days of the week (building up a fine sense of foreboding) to the constant weird things going on, this film is predictable and entertainingly so. Swarms of bluebottles appearing out of nowhere, a sinister hidden room in the basement, a priest haunted by a sinister spirit, a weird pig-creature in the window, blood pouring down the walls, a crucifix turning upside down, a guy getting possessed by a killer spirit and more besides?what's not to love here? Okay, so the film has some rough edges. For the most part, though, it's surprisingly undated, especially as the special effects are kept simple and down to earth. The cast is also decent: I don't like Margot Kidder, but she gives a suitably scared turn here, although Christian Bale look-alike James Brolin has the stand-out turn as the guy becoming increasingly deranged. Rod Steiger is good value, as always, as the priest enduring a run of extremely bad luck.I first saw this film a good decade ago and found it creepy and powerful and seeing it now in the modern age I find it just as creepy, with the demonic voice shouting 'get out!' still the scary highlight. Up there with THE ENTITY and POLTERGEIST as the best this genre has to offer. This is also one of the rare instances in which the remake (released in 2005) manages to be as good, if not better, as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of great ideas but it falls flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at this movie 35 years after it's release, it's very easy to see it's influence on movies made since, especially more recent (last ten years) horror, including movies like Insidious, paranormal activity etc. There are so many great ideas in this movie, I particularly like the relationship the child has with the spirit, that only she can see, an idea that has been used countless times since. But I feel like it was never fully followed through, it almost seems like they didn't know how to end this movie, how to tie it all together. The plot with the priest just fizzles out, the plot with the ghost on the child can see fizzles out, the idea that the husband is going to kill everyone fizzles out.. it just fizzles. It's just such a shame considering the possibilities. I also think it's overly long, and quite boring in some parts. There are a few jump scares early on but nothing spectacular. I kept waiting for things to get scary but most parts just seemed comical, like when the lead actor saw a ghost head of himself hovering in the cavity behind the wall in the basement. It even had a cheesy bit of music to go with it. I feel like maybe they were channeling some of the exorcist here with the priest plot lines, but it just didn't work. In the end, it was a totally unsatisfying movie, with a really weak ending. Having said that, I have to give it kudos for inspiring the movie makers of today, and I think modern horror is so much better for the ones that went before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real life tragedy exploited for the screen, but I dare you to turn away...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A whole family has been massacred by one of its own, and years later, the spooky looking house where these gruesome crimes took place is back on the market. Will tragedy repeat itself as the new owner seems to become possessed with the spirit of the dead killer? Possibly, since both of them had Charles Manson like beards. James Brolin, that great emotional actor, gives another stirring performance as the husband and father whose house may or may not be possessed. His wife is the smoky voiced Margot Kidder, straight from "Superman", giving a sensual performance in the romantic scenes with Brolin and a frantic portrayal of a woman who comes to her wits end thanks to the real estate mistake she made with hubby Brolin.The real star of the film is the spooky score by Lalo Schifrin, up there with "The Exorcist" as something I wouldn't want to hear while alone in the middle of the night. The house appears to have huge eyes, and some of the effects are truly horrific. As happens with most haunted house movies, there's a frantic priest (Rod Steiger in an extremely hammy part) and Kidder's nun aunt ("Another World's" Irene Dailey), both becoming psychological victims of the house's horrific evil.Having seen this in its original run and having been truly horrified at the time, I guess over the years, I've become immune to the type of effects this utilizes. Of course, there have been better horror movies with the house as monster ("The Haunting", "Poltergeist") which makes this one seem pretty insignificant in comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early morning hours on November 13, 1974 a young man murders his father, mother and four of his siblings while they are sleeping in their beds at home. About a year later a young couple by the names of "George Lutz" (James Brolin) and "Kathy Lutz" (Margot Kidder) buy the house and move in. Unfortunately, strange things begin to happen almost immediately afterward. For example, when a priest named "Father Delaney" (Rod Steiger) comes to bless the house he sees a swarm of flies in one particular room (even though it's in the middle of winter) and hears a voice commanding him to "Get out!" Feeling both shocked and quite ill he leaves immediately. Something similar happens when a nun by the name of "Aunt Helena" (Irene Dailey) comes by to see her sister, Kathy. She too becomes extremely sick and has to leave right away. And then things begin to get progressively worse. Now, rather than reveal too much of the story and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a pretty good psychological horror film. Admittedly, some parts were rather long and slow but the movie still managed to keep my attention for the most part. Along with that I also thought James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger performed rather well. All things considered then, I rate this film as slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call me a sucker for the 70s New Hollywood style, but I really dig the aesthetic for this film. Tellingly, this was released in 1979, and by this point that aesthetic had trickled down to even lowest-common-denominator genre films... for the better, I would argue.The Amityville Horror, like The Exorcist before it, situates itself in the idyllic, almost rustic, family life that it will soon reveal as harbouring a deep violence. A slow pacing also benefits The Amityville Horror, showing the gradual transformation of Josh Brolin's George into a territorial madman. Ironically, this film was blasted as being mindless violence when it was first released, but now it seems more cerebral and deliberate than the bulk of popular movies today.It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination -- the characters are two-dimensional and the acting doesn't help, and the conclusion in particular seems rushed. Other than the genuinely frightening bits with the flies, the movie is never able to really deliver the scares it hints at. To call this a horror classic is to perhaps do a disservice to the horror genre.But despite all this, it's not such a bad movie after all, and certainly deserves more than the initial round of condemnation. The Amityville Horror is a good evening of genre entertainment, providing a little to think on while the bodily thrills get to you, and that's all that we can really ask from a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Amityville Horror" is a generally creepy, but definitely overrated horror film from yester-year? Doesn't quite hold up to its reputation?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger star in director Stuart Rosenberg's 1979 thriller "The Amityville Horror", based on the alleged true story of the famed Amityville haunted house and the events that surrounded it. The film is a very well known haunted-house "classic", spawning numerous sequels (including one that just recently came out direct-to-DVD) and even a big-budget theatrical remake a few years back. And while it is still a well-known and widely-loved film, I just can't quite put my finger on why it is so highly regarded. It's a good haunted house film, sure? but it didn't seem all that special to me.It follows George and Kathy Lutz, a young couple raising Kathy's young children from a previous relationship, as they move into a large, cozy home in Amityville, Long Island in New York. At first the house seems perfect, even though it has a history- a year prior, the previous family was murdered inside, but the Lutz are willing to try and forget this. However, strange events begin to plague them, including odd sounds and bizarre feelings of anger, and George seems to be changing? becoming more violent.The film is, to its credit, pretty effective for a horror movie. Rosenberg's direction is more than adequate, and in particular, veteran composer Lalo Schifrin's haunting and iconic "singing girls" theme song is absolutely chilling. The film does have quite a bit of atmosphere, and there are some frightening moments, including a troubling scene where a babysitter is locked in a dark closet by some unknown force.The acting is all very solid. Brolin plays the role of George well, and you can tell he cares about the family even though he's a bit too hard on them and himself. And when the house begins to affect him, he does become fairly frightening. Kidder is also great in her role, and is quite lovely and caring. But I feel the film doesn't give her enough to do for her talent. She's there for you to feel scared for, and nothing more, it seems.I'm also a little torn on a few other aspects of the film. For one, though interesting, I do find the story to be? a bit? boring at times. The film is about two hours long, and it feels like 10-15 minutes of filler could have been taken out, easily. In addition, some of the scares are a bit silly. From a goofy scene with glowing eyeballs that looks like Christmas-tree lights, to the infamous "special effects pig in the window", some of the more effects-driven scares in the film fall flat. Finally, for a horror film, there isn't that much to really scare you? More often than not, the house and the evil "forces/spirits" don't feel like credible threats outside of one or two sequences. Also, the "rules" aren't established well, which caused me a lot of confusion. (Ex. The house is haunted, yet it can also apparently "curse" anyone who goes inside, yet it doesn't always do this?) But all-in-all, though flawed, "The Amityville Horror" is a pretty solid haunted-house ride. I'd give it a pretty good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to fans of horror.</fullReview>

The movie I got was a fairly well made story of a family who had moved into a house where murders had taken place. The actors were unknown to me although I had seen James Brolin and Rod Steiger briefly in other works.While not offering any horror or scares, the Amityville "horror" story kept my interest throughout and I can't really fault a film that had good acting (especially from Rod Steiger), didn't get boring and had a well structured story.The Amityville Horror was a better film than I was expecting but I believe it's been mislabelled as a horror film when it is really a thriller.</fullReview>

George let's his business fall, by allowing over due bills to pile up &amp; begins waking up at 3:15 a.m. the same time the murders of the family that lived there a year prior occurred, he spends most of his days sharpening his Ax &amp; cutting wood, while seemingly getting sicker &amp; more worn down &amp; very moody &amp; darker as time goes on, black ooze emanates from the toilets, the walls &amp; staircases bleed, doors are ripped off their hinges, windows explode, chandeliers move by themselves, chairs movie by themselves, haunting glowing eyes from a demonic pig, that stares at Kathy through a window sill at night, strangers appearing at their door &amp; then disappearing, missing money, one of the kids has a window pane mysteriously &amp; violently, slammed on his fingers, flies showing up when their not in season, the phones malfunction &amp; goes static when others try to warn the family of the dangers they are in, a priest's car malfunctions on the highway when they set out to warn the family &amp; almost winds up killing them, the youngest daughter's window keeps opening after it's been shut by the parents, the house is almost unbearably cold at times, despite being well insulated, the family dog constantly scratching at a basement wall until it's paws bleed, trying to get behind it, crosses are turned upside down, etc. The house is trying to get George to repeat the grisly happenings that occurred there a year prior, only this time in an even more heinous fashion.THE AMITYVILLE HORROR is a pretty entertaining horror film, released during the supernatural horror craze that gripped the horror film industry in the 1970's. The film's opening briefly shows the aftermath that occurred on November 13th 1974 &amp; then re-visits that horrible night in brief flashbacks, when the Lutz explore the house with a Realtor. The film boasts some pretty good effective chills however, a shrieking cat leaps into frame, chairs that move by themselves, freakish pig monsters that stare through windows &amp; LALO SCHIFRIN'S score (He also provided a truly wonderful one for THE EXORCIST) is pretty haunting with a child like melody that plays over the proceedings. But let's talk about that house! not only is it super creepy looking, but it's ominous presence could so easily be classified as a horror icon itself! The film itself in truth really isn't a film, more or less a documentary recounting the events that occurred there &amp; bears an almost made for TV movie feel to it. Director STUART ROSENBERG manages to deliver several cool shots &amp; despite it's over length, always manages to make the film creepy &amp; always has something going on to keep you hooked. The acting is really good here &amp; We get a pretty chilling background on the history of the land the house was built on &amp; a possible reason behind the supernatural occurrences &amp; the fact that the house might possibly be situated on a well, that is actually a portal to enter hell itself.On the downside however the film tends to overstay it's welcome, clocking in at the two hour mark! &amp; to be truthful, the film has no real story structure to it, it merely is just scene after scene of oddball supernatural occurrences &amp; since it's based on a true story, anyone who knows of it, knows that all the Lutz family members made it out alive, which immediately kills off any type of suspense, tension, terror &amp; momentum that the film might have had, as it regards a possible horrible fate that might befall the family members &amp; the film admittedly gets a bit hokey, a little corny at times.All in all, I highly recommend this movie, I really enjoyed it &amp; is one of the best horror films to emerge from the 1970's era. What should be noted is how the name "Amityville" is the name of a real town on Long Island New York, as a result the name cannot be copyrighted, which is why practically every film studio in town &amp; their producers later hitched their wagon's to this hit, by dropping the word "Horror" out of the title &amp; just calling them "Amityville movies" so they would not have to pay author Jay Anson every time they wanted to make a sequel (all the sequels had very little to do with the actual happenings anyways) A box office smash, despite the fact that the Lutz account of supernatural events that plagued them &amp; their children was later found out to be a hoax, (revealed after a series of appearances on the talk show circuits that helped make their story a sensation) that did not stop Hollywood from remaking the film in 2005 &amp; Following it up with various documentaries, as well as holding the record for the most sequels ever made to a horror franchise (eighteen thus far!) &amp; one prequel: AMITYVILLE II: THE POSSESSION***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting flick, not quite what I was expecting, though...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While searching on the web yesterday I ran across a link for Amityville, and of course it made me think of the Amityville horror story, which I had seen one of the sequels for, but not the original. So, off to the video store I go after reading about it. Ghost pig in the window, bleeding walls, demonic voices, etc..etc... sounds scary enough. And, of course, I suppose if these things happened in real life it would be to the insane asylum I go,but these scenes were no more than a flash, at best.(Esp. the pig...in fact, it happened so fast, had I not read about it before watching I would have missed it completely!I also never actually saw a pig, just some glowey eyes...I have the tape for another week, maybe I'll watch it again to see if I see it.) And also, it seemed I had seen this movie before, but it wasn't the same. I was about 11 or 12 at the time, but I remember the kids being much older and they were living in the creepy eye windowed part of the house, and didn't the brother start messing with his sister or cousin or something? Or am I thinking of another movie altogether? Or am I somehow splicing a movie with Amityville? It was so long ago, but I remember the real estate woman and the dog Harry(he looks pretty scary when he barks!) and I remember the Dad saving Harry and I remember the Nun but I don't remember anything else about it. I swear I remember some older, teenage kids. Was that a sequel??? Bottom line, it was long, interesting for sure, spooky, but not what I would call 'horror', and some of the parts were just boring..the spooky parts were spooky for sure, but it wasn't what I had expected. Sometime I will read the book. It's almost always true that movies never live up to the book. Oh, and, why, oh why would they tease with side shots only of Kidder's breasts? I mean, goodness, let's have a look, they're halfway out! Not to sound perverted or anything but they show half and just move on to another scene just when you're taking a closer look. &gt;sigh&lt; If you don't have a lot to do, check it out, it's alright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read Jay Anson's novel when I was in fifth grade, it terrified me and kept me up for days. Later I hear there's a movie and I'm like "Yes!" and I go buy it for 7 bucks and put it in the vcr. When it starts I'm all excited, the opening shot looks creepy and the music of course is the only real good thing about this movie is good. Goes okay for the next few scenes but then something happens.......George complains it is cold in house and the movie just implodes. Its nothing like the book, nothing! They rearrange certain things to make them fit into their version which is crap. It takes the basic elements of the novel, coldness, flies, Jodie, and pokes at them for almost 2 hours, it never delves into the origins of the threats, it only trinkles it here and there along with a chandelier moving slightly! It is seriously just a huge long endless line of semi scary stuff happening, oh I sense something in the room which is of course accompanied by a low rumble noise. It's plot less, and as so many here have pointed out pointless. Nothing is resolved, the house didn't even seem haunted for god's sakes, and nothing happens. Characters are put in and taken out and only used when they're needed which makes them virtually extras. I mean I cannot explain how pointless this movie is, hopefully the remake will be better but just seeing the trailer I already spotted several non-book stuff and different things not in the book. We'll just have to wait and see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair Movie That Could Have Been Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of whether the story is true or not, the premise of living in an evil haunted house after 6 murders took place could have made a great movie. Margot Kidder is the best actor in the movie with James Brolin in second place. Rod Steiger does his best with the dialog he has as Father Delaney, but unfortunately that part of the plot is never closed. Why doesn't Kathy Lutz pursue finding Father Delaney for answers? Why doesn't Father Delaney ask another priest to visit Amityville? And most importantly, when awful things start happening to the Lutz Family, why do they stay? The fact that they stay turns a decent movie into silliness. It would be better if they were somehow imprisoned in the house and unable to escape as a way to explain their stupidity, especially Kathy Lutz's since she never gets sick or evilly affected. I think the first half of the movie is best. It builds up slowly but steadily. The second half has most the flaws in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>based on a then true story of a haunted house in amityville new york in 1975 by a couple,the lutzes, who lived there. some good scares but seems to be overdone. later on revealed to be a hoax made up by the lutzes to gain fame and fortune. seems that alot of the things that the lutzes reported going on in the house were suspect. for example the police were never called , there was no such priest named mancuso,and no priests blessed the house period. plus the attorney for the man who killed his family in the house prior to the lutzes moving in had a nice bottle of booze with george lutz and made up alot of the story .. so a hoax ,decide for yourself ..not a bad horror flick but very average compared to classics like the exorcist and rosemarys baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm coming apart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the line I'll always remember from this movie! Although many think it wasn't done as good as it could have been and I agree somewhat I still enjoyed it-some parts WERE scary,(very scary in fact.)This is not a movie I'd recommend watching alone. I've also read the book and the book maybe more frightening then the movie. Amityville horror also had the right mood to it and besides being scary at times was genuinely disturbing.But there were some moments that were maybe unintentionally funny as well and the "I'm coming apart" line is one of them. There are a lot of similarities to "The Shining" here though I think "The Shining" is a better movie overall. Still Amityville is worth seeing.I'm glad it's being remade and I shall look forward to seeing the updated version-hopefully they'll skip the comedy this time. It is difficult for me to imagine others in these roles though. Amityville Horror was an original When it came out and definitely stands as a memorable story. My vote's 7 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About a week or so ago, I was rooting through some boxes of old videos when to my delight I came across my old copy of The Amityville Horror. Not having seen this movie for the best part of fifteen years, I immediately decided to watch one of my old favourites...what a mistake!I first read Jay Anson's The Amityville Horror when I was eleven. It was the first proper horror story I ever read, and it was soon followed by as many battered old Stephen King paperbacks, copies of The Omen, The Exorcist and as many other seminal novels as I could find. Being hooked at such a tender age, I naturally went on to hunt down all the movies, one of the earliest of which was The Amityville Horror. As I said, I'm sure I loved the movie when I was twelve.Let's just say it hasn't aged well. After a promising and essentially fact-based start dealing with the murder of the house's occupants, the De Feos, the film kind of just tapers off into a mind-numbingly dull trot through every haunted house cliche imaginable.******SPOILERS********I'm not really going to spoil the movie for anyone here. A loving couple, the Lutzes, move into the abandoned property at 112 Ocean Avenue (ironically named "High Hopes") and proceed to settle as any ordinary family would, with cats, dogs and three kids in tow. All seems to be fine, ("It's a pity all those people died here" says Kathy Lutz in the cinematic understatement of all time)until their friendly neighbourhood priest comes along to either bless the house or rehearse for a pantomime version of The Exorcist. Rod Steiger as Father Whatever-his-name-is chews more scenery here than he did in Mars Attacks, choking, gagging and breaking out in boils as flies buzz around his head and a voice cries "Get Out!" (presumably his agent.) And here's where the basic trouble begins.Whatever lives in the house obviously doesn't like the clergy (it pulls the same stunt on a visiting nun)and from now on it really goes to town - shutting doors, shaking chandeliers, making husband Big Beardy George feel a bit cold. Frightening stuff. I think it's trying to possess George or something, albeit half-heartedly, as in between shivering he likes to walk around with an axe, no doubt wishing he'd been given Jack Nicholson's role in The Shining. Meanwhile the daughter is talking to an invisible pig named Jody and Kathy occasionally snaps at George, or the kids, or whoever's around. Father Steiger can't visit to bless the house, being stricken with stigmata and blindness, and a fat cop who investigated the murders starts hanging around after the front door blew off it's hinges. The Lutzes are clearly doomed...Throw in a few jumpy moments, like a startled cat and a dog that barks at nothing, and you have a poor mix of several slightly better films. That this film and indeed the book purport to be based on real events is pretty laughable, especially if you do a little background reading, and does nothing to add to the "horror". The real George Lutz has been denounced as a fraud by everyone involved (although not by me, if you're reading - I believe it all!) The only frightening thing about this movie is it's made me wonder whether or not all my other old favourite movies are this crappy.Anyway, this torment of broken vases, rattly windows and backed-up toilets continues for twenty-eight days (in the book at least) until they do the smart thing and jump in the car and hit the road. When the family finally escapes, into a raging thunderstorm, naturally, the dog is somehow trapped in the basement, and here's where George the Hair Bear makes the exact same mistake I did - he returns to the house. He, and I, should just have left well alone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Amityville Movie Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a movie is such a good idea (or comes from such a good book) that it would seem impossible to screw it up when it came time to put the story on film. Then there's the Amityville Horror. Who edited this film? There's weird, unnecessary jump cuts during scenes that make what's going in the film almost impossible to understand. You only realize what was going on after the fact when you read the book or research the story on the net! Oh, the lion statue actually bit Mr. Lutz on the foot, thus the teeth marks? Tell it to us in the film! There's a floating pig outside the window? Really, I just saw two dots. There needs to be scenes added to the existing scenes just to make them make sense. And what about the story elements that ultimately come to nothing. The cigar-chomping cop who stakes out their house? He needs a scene at the end - he needs to witness some phenomena or help out the family in a pinch, but his character does nothing! And poor Rod Steiger (the best thing about the film) - he is supposed to be sacrificed in order to help the family (in an ideal movie, such as the priest in The Exorcist), but he never even meets them! His character just goes crazy and blind, and helps no one. What a waste! And what's with all the dumb vomiting? Also badly edited! I'll say this last. James Brolin is probably the most useless actor in history. I've never seen him in a role that required any acting talent whatsoever. Why was he even chosen for this film? Probably because he would work for the least amount of cash. Same with Margot Kidder, but at least she wasn't as clueless as her husband ("Hey, let's just pack up our stuff and get the hell outta here?"). Plus, she was good in Superman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat underrated, still not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE AMITYVILLE HORROR has the potential to be a truly terrifying psychological horror movie. It has several moments that are charged with bone-chilling terror, but the bulk of the movie is quite mediocre. This is mostly due to a sloppy screenplay that offers next to no character development, though scattershot direction and uneven performances don't help much either.As the young couple who have just bought the infamous house, James Brolin and Margot Kidder both turn in top notch performances. Brolin's performance received some criticism for being over-the-top, but I don't agree. I think he plays the part perfectly, and brings an intensity and creepiness to the character that many viewers apparently missed. On the other hand, Rod Steiger's manic performance is unintentionally funny at times.POSSIBLE SPOILERSThere are several individual moments of this movie that are genuinely frightening. Kidder enters her daughters bedroom, where the girl is talking to her "imaginary friend." She complains that Kidder scared her away and she went out the window. When Kidder goes to the window to appease her daughter, she is shocked to see two red eyes staring at her. Another scene has Kidder suffering a nightmare about the infamous murders that took place and awakening with a blood curdling scream. And, toward the end of the movie, Brolin has been enraged to the point where the malevolent spirits in the house no longer scare him. He walks to the house carrying an axe, and is angered, rather than frightened, when he sees a ghostly apparition looking at him from an upstairs bedroom. It's a good, eerie moment.The movie often manages to create an atmosphere of eeriness and evil, without ever really showing a ghost (except toward the end). Unfortunately, there's at least as many poorly executed sequences as effective ones. But if you can look past the shortcomings, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR is a decent haunted house movie with some good moments.If anyone believes that any of this stuff really happened, though, they're crazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Amityville Horror Thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read this book and seen the movie many of times along with its sequels..the 1st 2 have kept my interest of the movie but the following sequels drifted more away from the origin of the story.Its about the truth of the story that created the book and movie that has me quite intrigued.A disturbed,demented man in his mid 20's who plotted a plan to kill his mother,father and 4 siblings on the night of 11/13/74 in the family home located on Long Island,New York (village of Amityville). In execution style,he entered each bedroom of sleeping family members with a high powered rifle and with one gun shot to each of the sleeping bodies at approximately beginning at 3am. This is the given truth of the Amity murders at 112 Ocean Ave.I have serious doubts about the way "hollywood" recreated and reacted the movie from its truth to consider it a "haunted" house,but the average person(s) is going to refer to any murder/crime scene haunted following the aftermath and large volume of rumors and exhaggerations.From what I researched from theinternet pertaining to this story and topic regarding..there has been several owners of the house since the murders, may have been vacant for months between new owners..but from what I understand,the only discomfort and strange annoyance the families experienced is tourist trying to get as much information they can and trying to intrude visits unwelcomed/unexpected.The house is smaller than the movie has enlarged it and several remodels were made to try and disguise it from visitors,mainly the "eye" shaped top front windows were replaced. But its been 29 yrs since Ive heard about "The house on Amityville" and I'm still intrigued by the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS THROUGHOUT* I must say that this was not the movie I was looking for when it advertised itself as "the ultimate haunted house movie". Horror classic my ass, this movie is probably one of the worst haunted house films I have ever seen. Released in 1979, the same year as THE EXORCIST, this film doesn't manage to cough up a single scare throughout its entire running time of 118 minutes. And holy hell, did those 118 minutes go by slow! After about half the film, I was begging for it to end!The acting is mediocre for a horror film, but the special effects are pretty good. Eerily similar to Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING, there is everything from Kubrick's masterpiece from the crazy husband to chopping down the door with an axe. Possibly inspired by Stephen King's novel a little bit? I know it was based on a book itself, but maybe it was also inspired by King's novel a little bit (I say novel only because the movie had not yet come to be).There were some decent visual effects in here, but the script was very poorly written. It mainly consists of a bunch of people sitting around doing ordinary everyday things. There is a somewhat interesting scene about every twenty minutes or so. And even during the few parts of the film that are actually exciting, they only last about five minutes at the most. Just when the scene starts to get good, it ends abruptly.The end of the film is the best part of the entire thing as they all try to escape from the house like it's going to kill them, when absolutely nothing is happening other than a very hard wind blowing. But, still, this is the most enthralling part of the entire bogus film.This is a film that tries to be another film like THE EXORCIST as it tries oh so hard to make people religiously scared by trying to make them believe that there is a demonic presence or something like that. Rod Steiger is entirely wasted as he never even crosses paths with the other central characters. All he really does is get in a car accident, get attacked by "killer" flies, and scream "Our Lord Jesus Christ!!" at the church ceiling really loud. His part in the film was basically pointless. This film is for the more mellow horror crowd as there are no scares, hardly any nudity which is traditional in horror flicks (I was happy to see that this did not follow the basic outline of horror films as people die, stuff happens and then repeat, but actually kept the story moving---kept it moving very slowly, but at least it was moving) and not very much blood or gore.Certainly not a movie for everyone, I would hardly call this film a classic, but I will admit that it is one of the better horror flicks of the late '70s, but it was just not good enough to compete with all of the better films coming out today.THE AMITYVILLE HORROR gets 2/5. (OK, not the greatest.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but entertaining horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror "phenomenon" was the first of tons of sequels, and a lot of controversy about the supernatural at the time of it's release. (possible spoilers ahead) Basically it's about a newlywed family,(headed by Brolin and Kidder) who move into the famous Amityville house where murders had been commited. There strange things start to happen, starting with a priest (played by Rod Steiger) dscovering that the house is haunted and being turned away in terror. Then George starts to wake up for no reason at precisely 3:15 a.m, the same time that the murders were commited. Slowly he starts to become possessed by the spirits in the house, and takes on the look of the previous killer in his appearence and his behaviour.The Amityville Horror is helped tremendously by Lalo Schifrin's (Oscar-nominated) score, that was previously turned down by The Exorcist(!). The music is haunting and very effective, and it provides the right shocks to keep the film going. The movie itself is a bit slow-moving at times, but there is always a sense of fear and menace in the proceedings. The most disturbing part of the whole film is George's possession. To see him slowly being possessed by spirits and taking on the appearence of the murderer who lived in the house is, at times, truly terrifying.Margot Kidder is great in her role, and James Brolin also acts very well, while Rod Steiger is over-the-top as the priest. Yes, it may be a rip-off of The Exorcist and other movies about haunted houses and demonic possession, but this is still an effective, disturbing horror movie.</fullReview>

But why make a film about a haunted house if its not going to be haunted? It certainly didn't seem haunted. It was like, 'Quick - we've gotta get out of this house - quick - quick!!!!!' Why? What exactly were they running from? Acting-wise - Margot Kidder was good, James Brolin was passable - the remaining cast were completly over the top.

		<shortDescription>A film with a nature of evil...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most interesting aspects of "The Amityville Horror" is how the natural scenery is used to create a contradictory effect. Beautiful sky, lush woods and a calm lake go against the grain of what is happening inside the house. Storms appear during the most crucial times, as if the house can control the weather when it chooses to do so.James Brolin (as George Lutz) compliments this theme by slowly transforming into a form of the house's worst evil. Kathleen Lutz (Margot Kidder) is stuck in the middle of her husband's changes and the actions of characters who sense the unseen dark forces. She reaches out for help, but no one is there.Rod Steiger balances compassion with ire as a Priest who tries in vain to fight the evil off. Don Stroud's character, Father Bolin, was a bit bland, but over-all this film was an excellent production based upon a true story.</fullReview>

I loved it because it terrified me but there should be no reason to belittle it. Everything in general is in fact neutral and rather good for it's time period. James Brolin and Margot Kidder are good actors and there were a few scary moments like the screeching of the demon's voice when the priest was trying to bless the room and when that psychic lady's voice turned into a demonic tone when they were in the basement. I recommend you to see this movie only if you have the time so you can see the storyline and plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read a lot of the comments for "The Amityville Horror" and was surprised to hear that many people thought that it was not real. The movie of course was not real and neither was anything shown in the movie. But, as a resident of Long Island, NY where this movie takes place I can tell you that a gruesome murder did in fact take place. The house where the murders did took place is still intact and a family does in fact live in it. About 25 years ago a man in his 20's killed his family (Defeo's). His sister helped him. The man did not want to kill the children but the sister wanted to so she could move away with the boyfriend. So I would just like to say that the movie was in fact based on an actual event.</fullReview>

I Enjoyed Watching the Transition Of James Brolin's Character The Most. He Starts Off Like Any Normal Guy And Becomes A Charlie Manson Carbon Copy.

		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror. Okay this movie wasn't one of the best classical horror films, and wouldn't ever meet up with The Exorcist or The Shining, but the movie did have some scary moments, which all horror films have to have. I was very surprised to see that James Brolin is the father of Josh Brolin who was in movies such as The Mod Squad and Hollow Man. This movie is not one of the most "chilling tales ever told" or "the scariest haunted house movie ever", but on my scale met up to an averege, hardcore horror film. I give The Amityville Horror an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I heard of the Amityville Horror was when I managed to get my sister to tape me Amityville 4 in 1995. An entertaining film for when I was 13, let me tell you. Later that year, skipping through a paranormal book in the library, I found that there was truth behind the original story, of a house in Amityville supposedly `haunted' by demons and evil spirits.I decided to read Jay Ansons book. I was absolutely glued within its pages and couldn't stop reading. Never had I been so terrified in all my life. I thought it was absolutely shocking, that this story was believed in the first place. When you're that age you want to believe in the paranormal, and it made me convinced that evil forces were at work in that house because the owners fled within an inch of their lives. When I saw the film, it was a completely different affair. It lacks something, focussing on George and Kathy Lutz's relationship rather then the evil spirits. Who cares if the father starts to go crazy, we want to know what kind of evil forces lurk in the house! But this is supposed to be an account of a true story, you say. Well, the film seems entirely different to the book. Where did the bit where the priest become blind come from? Or where the claustrophobic baby-sitter enters the house and gets locked in the cupboard?I disliked the cast. James Brolin's beard looks atrocious, and you become more concerned for his shocking resemblance of a woodland creature then his character. The kids are boring, they didn't match the expectations of the book, especially `Missy'. I thought she was a very important character in the book because she brought in the `imaginary friend' theme, of Jodie the pig. Then in the book she talks of an imaginary friend telling her about the boy that used to live in the house who was shot. So the boy that was shot is one of the ghosts in the house? This is the sort of creepiness that made the book so wonderful. Here, Missy has the acting talent of a toilet seat.I know this review seems more-like a comparison between the book of the film, but the film could have been so much better. The book left things to your imagination. Here, those things that spun around in your head are brought to you on a plate, and become not half as satisfactory as you imagined them. Like for example, the well that was supposed to be the gateway to hell. The manhole cover in our back yard looks more terrifying. Or the `red room'. Come on, it's a storage area for tools that was painted red. And I don't want crude 2D floating images of George Lutz's face (even if they didn't have anything better in 1979). This film didn't need special effects, visual effects are more suitable and believable then computerised ones. Best scene in the film is where the medium discovers the well, and mutters something in a truly terrifying voice: `This is the well? It is the path? to hell!' combined with the intense music, this will wipe the smile of anyone's face. The worst scene is the ending, where they just run out of the house with black slime oozing out of the walls. What's this now, the house wanted them to flee for their lives, why didn't it ooze black Toymaster gunge in the first place?Best book I have ever read. Once more, you can buy the book from a second hand store for as little as 35p. Now THAT's a bargain! As for the film, it's worth a look, but it's certainly no classic and deeply average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A decent chiller based on a sensationalised "True" Story. The film is very atmospheric and has genuinely chilling (yet not truly scary) moments. At Two Hours long the film does threaten to become a little dull at times but manages to hold you attention. James Brolin and Margot Kidder both give tremendous performances, but Rod Steiger is hammy as the priest. A solid, creepy, well directed movie well worth watching. The films astonishing $86 million box office taking is bizarre. The sequel AMITYVILLE II - THE POSSESSION (really a pre-quel) was even better. All the other sequels were terrible.

Brought back old memories of when I saw it when I was younger. The rocking chair that rocks by itself, the swarming flies, toilets gushing goo, the ghostly voices, the puking nun (!!)...this has an atmosphere to it that absolutely blows me away. And..the beginning of the film is so creepy I would frequently put a blanket over my eyes. Some may call me weird, and say this isn't a good film.

		<fullReview>It's just a shame the film didn't cause the amount of terror I felt when I read the original book by Jay Anson. It is a half decent film - the acting is good, the direction is adequate, the music is sufficiently creepy enough - but there was just something lacking. The book worked so well because it played on your imagination, and this is where the film was doomed from the start. Some of the film's scenes don't seem to make a great deal of sense due to the fact that the watcher isn't given a sense of what the hell is going on. The special effects also left a lot to be desired too. However: the film is a good version of the book in which a family is nearly torn apart by malevolent spirits, and so is worth watching from that aspect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that the story of the Lutz's has been deemed a hoax, the film has lost its allure for many. I have read many comments posted on various web sites about the Amityville Horror, and most of them trash the movie for its poor acting, cheap special effects, and lack of direction; but most importantly, they trash the movie for not being scary. How, then, did it do so well at the box office and scare the bejezus out of people if it wasn't (isn't) that great? Simple: at the time of its release, the story had credibility, and if you believed in the paranormal at all, you were hooked. After all, some in the field of parapsychology had lent credence to what "happened" to George and Kathy Lutz in their Long Island home, and the media was all over the event like a three-ring circus; and we all know what kind of influence the media has over the people of this country. Hollywood executives knew this as well, and knew they could make a low-budget horror film based on the story due to people's willingness to believe. They didn't need the biggest stars, or the most expensive sets, or the best directing, they just needed something on film for people to see; and that's exactly what they did. The concept of the story being real filled in all the blanks. Now, if you strip the Amityville Horror of its "true story" concept, then all you're left with is an egg shell. And unfortunately, or fortunately (depending on how you view it), that's all we have left. Thank you, that is all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peace to this house and all who enter in it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George and Kathy Lutz (James Brolin, Margot Kidder) move their family into a creepy-looking Long Island house. The house was cheap so they ignore the stories of how there were murders there the year before. However, as soon as they move in strange things start happening. A priest that comes to bless the house is attacked by a swarm of flies and later suffers one thing after another as he tries to help the family. The kids talk to imaginary friends that tell them about the murders. George Lutz becomes withdrawn and sullen and obsessed with his axe. It quickly becomes obvious the Lutzes are not the only residents at 112 Ocean Avenue.Huge hit at the time of its release and based off of a best-selling book, The Amityville Horror's claim to fame is that it is supposedly based on a true story. Over the years a lot has come out to shed doubt on that claim, not surprisingly. But that doesn't taint the movie for me as I knew going in I wasn't watching a docudrama. Anyway, the movie is an OK piece of entertainment whose legacy has surpassed its quality. It's certainly not the bad movie many make it out to be these days (perhaps out of spite re: the hoax accusations). That being said, it isn't a great movie either. The performances are mostly adequate, though I will single out Rod Steiger for ridicule. He's an actor that, over time, became increasingly over-the-top. Thankfully, he's not in this much.Give it a shot if you're curious about it and you like haunted house movies. It's an enjoyable piece of entertainment that, when viewed in the proper conditions, can still give you a few scares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic haunted house tale with a shallow ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally went to see this classic and it didn't disappoint my expectations.Movie is well-paced, keeping you on the edge at all times. James Brolin &amp; Margot Kidder lead the cast well with great performances, specially from James.I never read the book, but I guess the movie is a more or less faithful adaptation from it, with a somewhat disappointing ending (was expecting a bigger climax in the end).Movie goes strong till the discovery in the basement, then goes downhill from there, building a false climax in the end and leaving me wanting more.The role I didn't catch was that of father Delaney (Rod Steiger), they seemed to build up his character as the movie progresses, to a shallow destiny without purpose.The bizarre looking detective was also a hit and miss role, discovering nothing in the process and disappearing suddenly from the scene.It seems the budget went low towards the end and they had to rush the movie somehow. No conclusions, nothing.... just a family running away from a "problematic" home (at least they didn't die and that was a pleasant surprise).6 for some good performances, overall mood &amp; keeping me alert till the end.As a side-note, I wonder if this movie influenced Kubrick on "The Shining" one year after. The scene with blood from the walls, Brolin smashing the door with an Axe was all too familiar.... although "The Shining" is a much superior movie, i was disappointed at the thought of taking ideas from this one.</fullReview>

They got the house cheap because of a brutal series of murders that had occurred there recently, and rumors of demonic possession.

		<fullReview>Based on a true place where a guy committed a mass killing on his family claiming to be terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there.In the movie, George (James Brolin) and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) move their family into a house even though the previous family suffered a mass killing. Their family priest Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) believes the house is haunted. The demonic spirits are powerful, fellow priest Father Bolen (Don Stroud) tries to help but Father Ryan (Murray Hamilton) is unconvinced.This movie came out in 1979 right in the middle of the Golden Age of horror. Halloween (78) came in the year before and Friday the 13th (80) came in the year right after. Masters of horrors like John Carpenter and Wes Craven are starting to emerge. This one just pales in comparison. They can't expect people to be afraid of flies. This is just not scary. The only good thing is that it is actually a professionally made movie. We have top acting talents. There's no complaining about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Would you move into a house knowing full well that it had been the site of a gruesome shotgun massacre thirteen months earlier? No, me neither, but that's what the Lutz family did in the winter of '75, spending less than a month in their new home before fleeing the property, claiming to have suffered a series of terrifying supernatural occurrences in the interim. Were the Lutz's brave, stupid, or simply after a lucrative book deal and a cut of the profits from the inevitable movie? You decide...The Amityville Horror, based on Jay Anson's best-selling account of the Lutz's ordeal, was one of the biggest horror hits of the 70s and has since spawned loads of sequels and a remake; it's an effectively creepy, well acted, and competently directed effort that succeeds in delivering a few scares and quite a bit of atmosphere, but it is also a rather frustrating affair, one that builds the tension to breaking point only to round things off with an anti-climactic ending that sees the Lutz family simply clearing out of the house, presumably in a hurry to get to the publishers and sign a deal for a sensational bestseller based on their experiences.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 purely for the scene where Margot Kidder does stretches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American International production of "The Amityville Horror" is a decent enough horror flick that at the very least features one of the most distinctive and iconic residences, not just in horror cinema, but in real life. It sure makes for one Hell of a poster image. Many people by now are familiar with this notorious story, based on the incident of the alleged haunting of a Long Island house. A year after one of the residents shot the rest of his family to death, a new family moves in, including newlyweds George (played by James Brolin) and Kathy (played by Margot Kidder) and her three children from a previous marriage. Soon ominous phenomena take place in this house, but they fail to inspire much terror; at the most they inspire some discomfort, as the walls and stairs are seen to bleed, the toilets vomit up black goo, and a room becomes filled with flies. A local priest, Father Delaney (Rod Steiger, who tears the scenery to pieces) becomes easily convinced that the house contains evil spirits and that the Lutz family is now in danger. Adding to that danger is the fact that George, who incidentally resembles the murderer, starts losing it and losing it so his loved ones have to deal with the potential for harm from somebody they know. So this movie does deal with that sort of familial issue quite well, although some viewers may tire of episodes such as a disappearing wad of money and having to watch characters it's hard to care that much about. On the plus side, we get Margot baring a bit of breast and exercising in a pair of bikini panties and one white stocking, as well as a DEEPLY committed set of performances; the supporting cast also features Murray Hamilton, Don Stroud, John Larch, Michael Sacks, Helen Shaver, Amy Wright, Val Avery, Eddie Barth, Hank Garrett, James Tolkan, and Peter Maloney. The movie is also not exactly without atmosphere and gets more and more interesting, and amusing, as it goes along, with the best parts tending to be reserved for the second half (although that beginning is great), with a reasonably intense finale. Sometimes, though, the response it will provoke may well be laughter. The haunting Lalo Schifrin music score is so incredibly catchy that this reviewer can still hear it in his head as he types this. Flaws and all, this is still a fairly entertaining film that may motivate intrigued audiences to look into the "real" story, the topic of some debate over the years. Six out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Amityville Horror' was a best selling book by Jay Anson which purported to be based on real events. George and Kathy Lutz and their children moved into a quaint and charming house on 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville, Long Island, New York, only to flee in terror after only twenty-eight days, claiming the place was haunted. What gave their bizarre claim spurious credibility was the fact that the house had been the setting for a mass murder. In 1974, deranged Ronald DeFeo brutally massacred all six members of his family. George bought the place cheap, claiming that 'houses don't have memories'. Soon he undergoes a personality change - chopping wood endlessly, shouting at his children, hitting his wife, and complaining of being cold. When Kathy reads an old newspaper account of the DeFeo murders, she sees that the killer looked exactly like her husband...Hollywood bought the rights to the story, and the result was this movie, one of the '70's last horror blockbusters. Stuart Rosenberg, the director, was responsible for one of my all-time favourite pictures - 'Cool Hand Luke' starring Paul Newman. The cast was headed by James Brolin ( a television actor who never made it as a movie star ) and Margot Kidder ( fresh from 'Superman' in which she played Lois Lane ). Also in there is Rod Steiger, slicing the ham thick as a priest who is besieged by flies when he tries to bless the house.On its release in Britain, the film was attacked by tabloid newspapers for bending the truth ( they can talk! ). "Amityville Hoaxville" was the headline on one such 'expose'. I'm not going to enter the debate over whether the story is true or not. I don't care frankly. What is of more concern to me is its viability as a film. It is basically just another movie about the supernatural, which probably would not have been so successful without the notoriety of the story behind it. Some events - such as blood oozing out of the walls - never happened. They were written in just to beef up the horror.It is hard not to laugh though as George starts whining "I'm coming apart!" and Steiger's yells of 'Jesus Christ' as bits of a church statue fall off and hit him squarely in the eye.On the plus side, Lalo Schifrin's music is good ( that opening theme will be following you around for days ), and the film manages a couple of genuine scares, but overall its nothing special. Michael Winner's underrated 'The Sentinel' ( 1977 ) knocks spots off it.The people who moved into the house after the Lutzes have never reported encountering any evil spirits. What I want to know is this - is the place was haunted, how did the Lutzes manage to stay there a full twenty-eight days? I'd have been out of there within the first weekend.</fullReview>

In my opinion the directors really backed away from the central character in the movie, that being the house, whereas the director in the original film concentrated solely on the house in the original film and that's what made the original film so spooky.As for Brolin, Kidder and Steiger, in the original film they may have been overly campy, but the more I watch the film the more brilliant their acting becomes to me. My god Margot Kidder was gorgeous when she was younger. One poster commented that all she could say in the movies was "kryptonite" but that is totally wrong. Margot Kidder is/was Canadian (is she still alive, I'm not sure). Ever heard of the famous Canadian movie "Black Christmas"? It was her one of her first movies, if not her breakthrough movie, directed by Bob Clarke. You might want to check that film out too for creepiness.So, I rate this film very highly and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a classic haunted house film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film... eh... I saw it when I was about twelve, and at the time, I absolutely loved it. It wasn't my favorite, but it was pretty darn unique to me. Now, however, I find it pretty good, but I'm not liking it quite as much compared to some of the more modern haunted-house flicks, and I'm an old-fashioned person, so that's saying something.The acting isn't perfect, and it does take some time to actually move along, and on top of that, it isn't very exciting when you get right down into it unless you've never seen a haunted-house film or at least very few.I suppose what's really nice about it is the idea of how the Amityville horror became what it is, or is believed by many to be. Also, how the suspense and dramatic feelings for the characters grow throughout the movie all the way up until the end is quite admirable.So I say it's certainly a good film. It's not the best, but it IS a horror classic of the late 70's/early 80's, and I'm sure it will continue to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yes i admit...it may not be the scariest thing you ever see. However, considering the facts that 1) it was made in 1979 with no intention to be a big hit, 2) the movie was made to show what was a "true story" and therefore was not expected to have a great story line and 3) the producer tried to make it as interesting as possible while still reflecting on the book (which i may add...is boring)...and the story from the Klutz...oops I mean ...the Lutz, which can also be false. If you consider the facts, the movie was not that bad. It had decent actors, with a decent script, okay "horro" moments, that will scare the crap out of a teen in 1979...just not now. I liked the movie, its the best ever...but it good!</fullReview>

George actually went back for the dog just before they left the home at the end.. In other words, this movie is described as " scary as hell" in my opinion</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the classic version of the grizzly nightmare in Long Island. Though there were several differences in this version and the update I recently saw, are the plots. The babysitter was a braceface and the priest got the house in the beginning of the movie. It's hard to say which was scarier. The 1979 version really shows how evil the house is, and the 2005 version has the full details. The sink and the commode scenes set everything apart form one another and I think the car scene was another factor as well. I was only a baby when the murders took place and I foretold by my mother about living near that dreaded area. Though I lived in a haunted house myself, we were more fortunate than the Lutzs. And I do feel sorry for them. This movie has the creep factor, the 2005 version had both the sex and the creep factor as well. They were equally entertaining but I think the intensity is kinda hard to match. Rating 3 out of 5 stars. 1979 Rating 3 out of 5 stars. 2005 Enjoy them Both!</fullReview>

The story could have used a bit of work, but the result is that The Amityville Horror is one of the most entertaining non-brainers ever made in the 70's. Even though there were a lot of flaws, the acting is superb. The effects were good enough and there's a lot of suspense to keep you chilled. There were a bit of scares in the movie. Not much, but it was freaky at times. The movie may not be incredibly voilent, but hell, it did'nt need that much anyway. Overall, an entertaining movie, lets hope The Amityville Horror remake is better. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a desperately dull yawnfest that, in light of recent reports on the internet exposing it as nothing more than a very elaborate hoax, is rendered even more ludicrous than it already was when first released. It truly is staggering that a film where so very little happens was so successful, and gained such a following. It looks cheap and badly-produced, the performances are unconvincing (Rod Steiger is the worst offender, hamming it up big time as the overwrought priest Father Delaney), and the legendary house, while it looks the part, has to be the most boring haunted house in the history of haunted houses (a few mild rumblings and some dodgy plumbing are not what I would call scary). If you're seeking some genuine thrills from a movie in this vein, I'd recommend the far superior "The Haunting" (the 1960 original, not the vacuous 1999 remake). It pushes all the right buttons, is subtle without being tedious, and is genuinely creepy. But avoid this trashy bore at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. After all the hype about this movie being based on a "real life haunted house" where a killer kills his whole family and then gets carried off is like no other story thats different than the stories we see on the news or in the paper. There are many houses where people are killed by family members. I don't know about them being haunted though but this movie is just a rip off of all those stories we see in real life. The actors are terrible where did they get this James Brolin guy as the father? He looks like a cross between a wild caveman and a mountainman or some wild rebel. Anyway he comes across as being the efectionate husband with a wife and her three bad kids and then turns into someone possessed and all the sudden turns on her. Then he snaps out of it and doesn't what to think or what he's become. And the wife Margot Kidder who just plays the part of a sweet, careing mother who you just want to smack around to get her back into reality and to stop makeing the movie even more boring and slow why is she even chosen for this part? And then they had the nerve to put a little story in the ending saying that the family has moved and left all their stuff in the house and that the story was real. Huh!!! It's a fake!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It should have been easy to make the book "The Amityville Horror" into a movie. It's written simply, so it's creepy images are easy to see in your head and would be easy to translate to the big screen. The scares are simple, and wouldn't require a lot of special effects. It would take a real dullard to muck up a film adaptation of it.Not that I'm calling the folks who made this movie dullards. Although I'm pressed to explain how they managed to make such a stupid, ugly, and not-scary-at-all movie based on such rich source material. I guess the screenwriter and director should hold the blame for messing up the story. I mean, they eliminated such great parts from the book like the white hooded figure with half a face, and the subtle, spooky imagery of the whole family sleeping in the same positions as the victims of a mass murder who died earlier in the cursed house. Instead they just to make the father of the family (a pre-Striesand James Brolin) into a Shining-style ax-wielding maniac, but he snaps out of it almost instantly. They didn't put any thought into anything. Nothing interesting happens in this bore-fest, except for a puking nun, and we don't actually get to see the nun vomit, we just hear it.The cast is pretty wretched. Brolin is a hairy zombie for most scenes, and Rod Steiger is embarrassingly bad as the priest (who's part in the book was much more sympathetic and human, and didn't just yell all the time like Steiger). Margot Kidder is bland and spooky looking. The scariest scene in the movie is seeing her in odd underpants and dopey leg warmers.I guess what I'm saying is, if you ever get the urge to rent this, rent the superior "Poltergeist" again. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The poster for "The Amityville Horror" tells us ? practically screams at us ? the words "For God's Sake, Get Out!" Having seen the movie, I'm not sure if that is meant for the characters or the audience.The Amityville Horror is a haunted house movie with termites. It doesn't really move so much as it slowly ambles its way from one cliché to the next and about every 20 minutes an object will move by itself. The characters here have no personality and no energy to speak of. Even the ghosts exude a measure of lethargy and compared to the actors that's pretty swift. If you can imagine a Corona commercial that runs 117 minutes you get the idea.The story is based on the real-life murder case of Ron DeFeo, who early on the morning of November 13, 1974 murdered his family with a double barreled shotgun. Eleven months later, The George and Kathy Lutz moved into the house (which they bought as a suspiciously low low price) and 21 weeks later fled in terror leaving their belongings behind claiming that an unseen evil force drove them from their home For years, the Lutz family stuck to their story and it was only a few years ago that they went public again to say "Ya know, we gotta be honest here . . . we may have stretched some of the facts juuuuuust a weensy little bit." I wish they had done that before the world got inundated with the crappiest nine-movie franchise this side of Friday the 13th. Thanks for nothing guys.After the Lutz's made their story public it was put into the hands of Jay Ansen who turned into a book that got turned into this movie. It is pretty faithful to the book except that, ya know, reading scenes in which characters walk around the house and scenes of chopping wood and scenes of sitting in front of the fireplace and scenes of aerobic exercise do not really translate well when you're making a HORROR MOVIE!! It's a sad state of affairs when the scariest thing in a haunted house movie is hard rain.George and Kathy are played by James Brolin (the only straight man in the world who can freely admit a love for Barbara Streisand without getting quizzical stares) and Margot Kidder (trying to star in at least one movie that doesn't contain the word "Kryptonite"). This is an odd couple: He has a weird fascination with the fireplace and she has an affinity for fetish-wear (pigtails, schoolgirl outfits etc). That's about the limit of their quirkiness. Everything else about them is about as exciting as drywall.Seriously, this is the most boring couple I've ever seen in a movie. They don't do anything . . . I mean, nothing . . . ever. It's so bad that even when they run for their lives they drag their heels. Their function in the movie: Get nervous, look shocked, argue, reiterate plot points, rinse and repeat.The Lutz's haven't even unpacked when ominous things begin to slooooooooooooowly reveal themselves, like a chair that rocks by itself, blood the wells up in the toilet and 1500 dollars that suddenly disappears. I still haven't figured out what the evil force in the house stole a fistful of cash but the fact that I pondered that question just goes to prove that I have too much time on my hands, so I'll move on.Rod Steiger arrives early in the film, walks into the house when no one is there and is soon forced out of the house by violent vomiting and a plague of flies. He spends the rest of the movie slowly losing his health and little bits of his mind. He tries to warn Kathy but the demons are apparently working at the phone company because all she gets is static.I was also puzzled why after these terrible events: Brolin becoming temporarily possessed and nearly takes out the family with a double-bladed axe; blood burping up in the toilet, the walls bleeding; the priest coming down with a state of catatonia, it's only then that Kathy suddenly comes to the brilliant conclusion "Maybe we should move". Watching the movie I said, before I thought "Good! I'll help ya pack!" The movie is a trial, its so deadbeat that you scratch your head to figure out how it became a hit at the box office. At 117 minutes it's Hell to watch and even worse to ponder. The worst thing about the movie, the subtitles which inform us that it's "The 10th Day", "The 17th Day", "The Last Day". Bad enough when a bad movie seems endless, worse when it reminds you how endless it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Amityville Snore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, what we have here, folks, is the mega-dreary, and totally un-scary, original, 1979 version of The Amityville Horror (or TAH, for short).Following its release (over a period of time that would span 15 years) this film has spawned 7 equally awful sequels. And, then, of course, there was the year 2005 when the dreaded remake of TAH inevitably happened, which, naturally, wasn't a hell of a lot better than the original.(Why-Oh-Why do they continually persist with junk such as this?) For anyone who isn't hip - This film's story is based on the alleged "real-life" experiences of the Lutz family who (under full knowledge) bought the home on 112 Ocean Avenue, Long Island, where a mass murder had been committed a year earlier, in 1974.Shortly after the Lutz family moved into this place, they were reportedly subjected to a series of frightening paranormal occurrences, which eventually caused them to flee for their lives from the house only 28 days after checking in.As one can well-imagine - The validity of these so-called paranormal occurrences have been subject to much controversy, and several vicious lawsuits concerning truthfulness, as well.Actor James Brolin, who played the movie-role of George Lutz (the father of the family), had actually met the real Mr. Lutz while the filming of TAH was still in progress. It certainly didn't take much time for Brolin to come to the conclusion that Lutz's story about a possessed house was "highly" doubtful.This "highly" doubtful assumption of Brolin's was probably quite accurate, indeed, when you seriously consider that the Cromarty's who moved into the house in 1977 had never had any complaints about unnatural "disturbances", and such, nor had anyone else who has moved into this house since.As unbelievable as it may sound - At the time of its release, TAH was one of the highest grossing "indie" films of all time, raking in a whopping $86 million, worldwide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never really been a fan of horror movies that become a large series of repetitive franchises (Resident Evil, Paranormal Activity, Insidious, etc.) but what makes me love this 1979 film isn't so much the plot, it's more the way the story is presented that I loved.The plot is as basic a horror flick as you're gonna get, a Kodak moment-type family moves into a large house in the country despite the fact that another family was previously murdered there. Soon some odd events start happening, getting more and more sinister each day. Anyone could come up with that story, it would be easier than anything. But the film presents the horrific events in ways so intense that it makes this movie stand out above the others in its genre. For example, when one of the kids has a window slam shut on his fingers. It's graphic, sad and incredibly disturbing, the poor boy screams in terror as blood oozes out from his trapped fingers and his parents frantically scream for help. On the version of the film I bought, the sounds of people screaming are enhanced to be louder than the rest of the film, making for many jump scares. The soundtrack is haunting, eerie and beautiful and the 1970's atmosphere makes me want to do up my hair in a feathered hairstyle, grab a super 8 camera and a ticket stub to Star Wars, some disco vinyl records and go back in time to when days were better! This movie has certainly been replicated, remade and butchered far too many times (The Conjuring is the rip-off that stands out the most), but this version is a true cult classic and a campfire-style horror story that will probably keep affecting viewers for generations to come. I also recommend watching Sinister (2012), Pet Sematary (1989), The Shining (1980) and The Messengers (2007) if you're looking for similar movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Amityville Horror is a classic haunted house chiller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Newlyweds move into a house where a murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away. Based on a true story that was claimed by writer Jay Anson, The Amityville Horror is about a large house on the coast of Long Island where newly weds George and Kathy Lutz and their three children move into the house that they hope will be their dream house but it ends up in terror. Despite full disclosure by the real estate agent of the home's history, George and Kathy buy the house. George says, "Houses don't have memories," but they turn to their family priest Father Delaney who believes the house is haunted and performs an exorcism on the house. But the evil spirit in the house causes him to become blind and makes him very ill. George and Kathy with the help of another priest Father Bolen and a police detective they face the fears of the house, but not knowing the spirit is planning to possess George and then the children. Roger Ebert wrote "The problem with "The Amityville Horror" is that, in a very real sense, there's nothing there. We watch two hours of people being frightened and dismayed, and we ask ourselves... what for? If it's real, let it have happened to them. Too bad, Lutzes! If it's made up, make it more entertaining. If they can't make up their minds... why should we?" The Amityville Horror has remained one of the 70's better horror oddities, and has become a cult classic for good reason. The Amityville Horror is a classic "haunted house" movie that has stood the test of time and is still rated as one of the best "ghost stories" ever filmed. I can easily recommend to anyone that is intrigued with haunted places and creepy horror movies. The movie is not perfect but it is still good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DIS MOVEEH DUMB AS HELL (Lol, don't worry I don't actually write like this)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm generally not a fan of the whole "haunted-house" genre, but I figured since this one's a classic- it'b be alright. First off. I knew this was gonna be a bad movie after: A: a fly caused two priests to spin out of control while they were driving (Hi--llerious) and B: after the ghost(s) stole $1500 from a groom on his wedding day. Wtf? Since when do people need to worry about ghosts stealing money. This movie gets annoying real fast. And here are some reasons why: -None of the characters know how to open doors. -No one can hold an object long enough to NOT drop it. -The kids in this movie have NO personality; and basically act as fillers until they get shot in the end; and they're ALL stupid as hell (P.S little girl; when your babysitter is locked in a closet literally three feet away from you, maybe you should do something as opposed to just sitting there like a nu-bis). -Margot Kidder is way too hot for this movie. -James Brolin looks like a homeless man (yet his legs have no hair/ looks like it all migrated to his face, loll). -Every priest/nun in this movie is bonkers (just cause your a priest doesn't mean you can just waltz right into a house completely unannounced---"But i'm blessing it".."Oh, swell man, we got a doorbell." F#**%in Creep. -The house seems to give everybody "the creeps" --even during the daytime. Oh Jinkies.-There's way too much foreshadowing--the whole movie is basically one giant spoiler. -Apparently, this movie has rewritten the boundaries of anatomy and now blood just squirts out of the epidermis- or anywhere for that matter (the walls). -George is pretty much an a**hole the whole movie. -George goes to the hospital, but doesn't bother to ask about his apparent "flu". -Nothing scary happens in the first hour of the movie. Overall, the 70's was a breeding ground for excellent, stylish horror movies (i.e, The Omen, Black Christmas, The Exorcist, Halloween, Evil Dead, Chainsaw Massacre..etc) that would define the genre and mold it into the billion dollar industry it is today (blah,blah, blah I have no idea what i'm talking about.) The fact of the matter is...this film is not one of those movies. It was born at the turn of the decade, and just missed it's mark, I guess. I think this was the point when horror movies started becoming methodical instead of original. There's the deep drone of a bassist before every startling incident; fake-out jump scares; actual jump-scares; stupid- a** kids with imaginary friends, there's blood. blood..ooh so much blood. So yeah. Just not that great of a movie.Go watch it! ;P</fullReview>

Despite being debunked and discredited, the story has become part of our popular culture and has inspired documentaries, novels and a slew of films of which Samuel Z. Arkoff's production of The Amityville Horror was the first. Fuelled by the best-selling book and sensational media coverage this rather ordinary PG rated ghost story became a huge box office hit and even managed to score an Oscar nomination for Best Music.

		<shortDescription>It's no masterpiece - but it works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far the best film in a series that sustained any kind of quality for precisely one instalment, 'The Amityville Horror' is a solid shocker that doesn't add up to much or stay with you when the lights come on, but it really works all the same. Based on an ostensibly true story that is, obviously, utter tosh, director Stuart Rosenberg tells it in a straight, unblinking way that's ultimately really persuasive; none of this actually happened but while the movie's on I could almost believe that it did.James Brolin and Margot Kidder make a likable and attractive couple who move into a house they got for a bargain price due to the murder spree that happened there a few years earlier. The lingering bad vibes result in such apparently random haunting staples as blood running down the walls, black goop bubbling up in the toilet and an infestation of flies, and while all that's going on Brolin goes bonkers and turns on Kidder and her kids.Rosenberg stages the shootings in a really effective way, with the gunshots lighting up the windows during a lightning storm, and as we're given a tour of the house the movie cuts back and forth between the cosy description of each room and the awful things that happened in them. His direction throughout isn't flashy, but nor is it flavourless; it's matter-of-fact, but in a really good way. Together with Robert Brown's well-paced editing the movie comes off as far less ridiculous than it could have been.There are plenty of moments here that genuinely freak me out: the red eyes at the window; the disembodied voice growling 'Get out!' at Rod Steiger's priest; the front door tearing off its hinges; the scene where the babysitter is trapped in the closet; the expression on Brolin and Helen Shaver's faces when they break down the basement wall. Even the house is creepy, with those weird windows. It might be pretty silly stuff, and in the cold light of day it certainly seems that way, but in the moment this stuff is genuinely effective. Even the frickin' goofy bit with the pig staring down at Brolin is sinister as anything. The movie builds with a growing intensity, and so the simple scares ? a couple of red lights and a growl, for instance ? come when the foreboding atmosphere has us primed. There are drawbacks: it's too long, for one thing; the subplot with Steiger suffering the after effects of the haunting goes on a couple of scenes after its natural conclusion. The connection between Brolin and the previous occupant of the house adds an unnecessary layer of fate to the proceedings. And Brolin has some hammy moments (although I'm not sure anyone could have sold that 'I'm coming apart!!!!' scene). In the main, though, he and Kidder and the children are convincingly terrified, which helps further sell it all. It's quite an impressive film in its own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly good movie, couple things wrong with it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sticks fairly close to Jay Anson's novelized account of the Lutz family's ordeal at 112 Ocean Avenue. There are some slight changes, as noted in other reviews, to heighten dramatic effect; however, none as horribly disfigured as the 2005 remake, which completely obliterated the "known" facts about the incident. My problems with it, personally, are their choice of Margot Kidder to play Kathleen Lutz. I didn't even care for her performances in the Superman franchise. Just something about her rubs me the wrong way. Much of the incidents revealed in the novel were omitted from the movie mostly because it was a low-budget film, the last from MGM before they merged, and the money just wasn't there to make it into a high-grade spectacle that would do it justice. Still, stripped to the bare bones, it conveys the basic message of the story and, in my opinion, is the best of the entire Amityville franchise. My suggestion: read the book first!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When it comes to imagination nothing can beat reality !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of Horror. Though, I sat to watch it from a historical point of view. I read about it before, heard about its sequels and remake. I wanted to know what is so special about it. And initially; there isn't ! I mean this is the most uncomplicated movie ever. Everything is so simple. It looks sometimes so horrific for its TV-ish atmosphere ! What's the plot ? True that it's sometimes a bit Hitchcockian when you set afraid of the shock to come, imagining what it could be, or what it could do (the situation of the babysitter), but it ended up as just a shock after another. The end is poor. And as nearly billion of viewers had said over the years "WHY THEY DIDN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE PREVIOUSLY ?!!". What's the mystery's answer ? The movie puts no understandable monster, certain powers, or known demands for the spirits. We didn't know is it evil for evil or not. Now, let me think, did all of that cause the movie's big success ? Was this kind of abstract horror something different and thrilling ?? Which leads to the second, deeper, look. Despite anything this movie's talent of being creepy is totally undeniable. So, what's the secret of it ? I believe it's under the surface. Clear and sharp; it's its fact as a based-on-true-story. Its realistic factor is the most important, creative and effective thing about it. According to this; its silent pace, simple look and plot-less condition seem harmonic and work finely, being close to docu-drama more than the typical haunted house drama. That stagnant, no flashy, surface someway served the notion of realistic horror best. It's as surprisingly spooky as life itself. Don't wonder, because life is the original source of all the fear's kinds. And just remember something I used to say since years and years : even legends came from reality. It only waits for the right artist to bring it up. And in (The Amityville Horror) they were lucky too.P.S : The thing that distinguished this movie is lost in its sequels (7 in the next 17 years), they were all fancy exploitative horror, so mostly straight-to-video as well !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy But Slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Amityville Horror" is the story of the Lutz family, who moves into a house where a man killed his whole family a year before. Soon, bizarre and eerie things begin happening, and a local priest believes that the Lutz family may be in danger. This movie had its creepy moments, but the movie took a bit long to get going. The acting was believable, and it managed to keep me watching for the whole 117 minutes. The special effects where pretty dopey, but they were probably pretty good when the film first came out. I recommend this film to horror fans, just don't go expecting gratuitous gore.Rated: R for Violence, Brief Nudity, and Some Sexuality.Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Goo and flies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know they want you to think this was a true story, and that this really happened to the family who lived there (lutz's)over the course of 31 days or so. That black goo really came out of the toilet and walls, that there were tons of flies in the sewing room upstairs, that demon voices were heard telling a priest to get out, that a small statue of a lion came to life and chewed on Mr. Lutz's leg. If you believe all that than you must believe pigs can fly....oh wait there is also a demon pig with red eyes that likes to look into the windows of the house.If you treat this as a better than average horror film than it is not all that bad. James Brolin and Margto Kidder play the parts of Mr and Mrs lutz the owners who claim this really happened to them, however there have been reports in recent years that the real Lutz's made the hoax up due to financial reasons and the large mortgage they were strapped to. Maybe they saw an opportunity with dollar signs to build on the already infamous status the house had. For those that are not familiar with that story there was a family that was murdered in the house about a year or so prior to the Lutz's moving in. It was a 28 year man who killed his whole family after voices that he claimed told him to do it. Would have made no difference to me if the dog told him to do it. In any case an above average horror story if it is treated just as that....above average and fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not over-hyped but its horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK first of all this film needs to be regarded within its genre as all horror films should. This film is excellent for a horror film. It starts off with the previous murders in the house which I thought was pretty cheesy and made me have expectations about the level of Phantasm (which is really enjoyably bad) for this movie. However the acting isn't bad at all and while the flies are silly the other events that happen in the house actually create a good amount of suspense and the end is just great and I don't think over-hyped at all. It certainly is better than the mindless gore-fests that are put out so often these days. In fact its pretty artfully done and reminds me a lot of other 70s classics.This movie has two good points. One is the stand out performance of the priest, father Delaney. He singularly pulls you into the plot and gives the movie a fantastic creepy feel. At least when hes on screen, without him the movie would be pretty vapid. It is his performance that makes the film worth watching at all and his growing mental deterioration and stress is particularly stirring. There is just something about him that makes him immediately empathetic and thus keeps you tied to the movie as he attempts to fight the evil in the house. Hes given a cheesy part, especially in the church scene (a rather silly &amp; weak scene) but hes a believable character.The second good point of the movie is the ending which is classic horror and really fantastic for the date in which it was done. The whole movie is worth sitting through just for the end. The effects show a very surprising restraint keeping from killing or dating the movie with too many sub par effects. Really, the movie is really well done, its just the plot that is weak.All in all its a horror flick. Of course the burial ground, Indian past, Satan worshiper and passage to hell aspects of the plot are cliché, but this is horror. At least this cliché is from the 70s (thus attempts to be artistically portray silly horror stuff like the Stepford Wives) and relies more on suspense than weak effects and has decent continuity. The acting isn't terrible but after watching the most memorable character to me besides the priest was the dog. The eye like windows on the house are a nice touch and the silly effects like the demon pig are kept to a minimum. The blood through the walls and really the whole ending is classic and some of the makeup is great for when it was made. Amityville Horror is filmed well and definitely worth a watch but all in all the strong points don't entirely overcome a silly plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror has been the subject of nine films, which are as follows:The Amityville Horror (1979) Amityville II: The Possession (1982) Amityville 3D (1983) (this film was made in 3-D, and has also been released as Amityville III: The Demon) Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes (1989) (This was made for television) The Amityville Curse (1990) Amityville 1992: It's About Time (1992) Amityville: A New Generation (1993) Amityville Dollhouse: Evil Never Dies (1996) The Amityville Horror (2005) (remake). The best known of these films is the first version, which was released in July 1979. The film was made by the independent production company American International Pictures headed by Samuel Z. Arkoff, and directed by Stuart Rosenberg. It starred James Brolin and Margot Kidder as George and Kathy Lutz. The part of the priest who blesses the house was played by Rod Steiger, whose name in the film is Father Delaney. The 1979 version and its two sequels were filmed at a house in Toms River, New Jersey which had been converted to look like 112 Ocean Avenue after the authorities in Amityville denied permission for location filming. The music score for the film was composed by Lalo Schifrin and nominated for an Academy Award, but lost out to the score for A Little Romance by Georges Delerue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great horror film for its time!!!. I loved this movie because it scared me so bad. I had watched this with my friends after watching dawn of the dead (i reviewed that to)so it made up for the scares dawn of the dead didn't have. I didn't like how there wasn't any gore. But the windows the hole to hell the flies on the window the fact the guy looked like grizzly Adams made me change pant a number of times. I also thought that it was a rather realistic movie for the time. I gave it a 9 because it was creepy but it Kinna of lost the hole sense of a relentless non stop gore show that not only scared you but made u sick that movie with that fact deserves a 10 but this wasn't violent and it also didn't make u think to hard.

		<shortDescription>28 Days Of Dread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*The Amityville SPOILERS* November 1974; Ronald DeFeo, Jr. kills his parents, two younger brothers and two younger sister in their home at 112 Ocean Drive, Amityville, New York.December 1975; George Lutz (James Brolin) and his wife Kathy (Margot Kidder) move into the house with Kathy's two sons and daughter from her first marriage, and soon they understand that something's definitely *not* right with the house, as does the Priest (Rod Steiger) who tries to bless the house; 28 days later, they left, not taking any of their belongings with them nor reclaiming them ever again.Why? This movie was based on a book written on one of the most controversial haunting stories ever happened; nobody knows exactly if the Lutz' claim that the house was haunted was true or false (and probably we'll never know, because both George and Kathy have passed away recently - Kathy in 2004, during the shooting of the Amityville Horror remake, and George a few months ago).What I can say is; the movie manages to create an eerie atmosphere with the score (the main theme in particular), and throughout some situations (the priest's attempt at blessing the house, or the infamous 'babysitter' scene), but the actors seem to have no shame about overacting (especially Margot Kidder, who seems to practically act Kathy if she was a cross between Nancy Drew and that dement Nonnie Parry from The Poseidon Adventure), and the ending is a total letdown (the kids look like they're bored instead of scared out of their minds - and why is the girl smiling when George runs back to the house to get the useless dog?).Amityville Horror (1979): 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but some parts proved to be made up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilers: Some parts of the movie seem to be made up. For example, the Lutz family moved into the house in December. I live on long Island and, though sometimes it rains that time of year, it does not lightning or thunder. In this movie,it looked like the middle of spring. Not that its a big deal, but if the story is true, I do not know why they would change that. Also, if they thought the husband was possessed, why would they let him drive the car away from the house? The acting was good. This version is much better than the remake. It was scary, and there were constant surprises. It showed that house as scary, rather than showing the step-father/husband as mean ans scary, as it did in the remake. Though the babysitter was not exactly as beautiful and glamorous as in the remake, she acted well. She was believable, in comparison to the second one. I liked that the dog was not killed in the first one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A commentary track is a selling point for me when it comes to DVDs. But the "expert" they have doing commentary for this movie Dr. Hans Holzer reacts like he hasn't seen the movie or hasn't for a long time and seems to be pushing a theme deriding organized religion as a business, while clearly he has a business himself as a "medium." Listening to him, I'm not sure what a Phd. is worth. He contradicts himself by saying that a spirit such as "The Indian" whose burial ground has been violated can't haunt or have impact outside of those grounds but that when Hans visited the prison, The Indian interfered with hypnosis of a man who murdered his family.The commentary track has long stretches where apparently Dr. Holzer is silent and the viewer might think he is done. He sounds like a sleepy guy trying to ask for a job, but not especially inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trivia about the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanted to let all the fans of this great movie is that it was not filmed at the original Amityville house in New York but, was shot in Toms River New Jersey. The house still stands to this day but has been moved from its original address. They actually moved house and all around the corner and out of direct view from traffic off Water St. If you look hard enough you can still see it or you can turn off on to the side street that is on now. My father who was a police officer in Dover Township which is Toms River worked the security detail and was able to meet the entire cast and film crew. My father was actually in the movie before it was edited. It was only a very small part where he was filmed riding his Harley Davidson past the bar that James Brolin went into during the movie. Also, just a little piece of info James Brolin also borrowed my fathers Harley to go for rides to clear his head and my father also took the kids from the movie for rides. Just wanted to add this because it's my fables little claim to fame. We have an un-cut version of the movie that shows the scene of him riding up the street and past the bar just as James's Brolin pulled up. My sister has autographs from Rod Steiger, James Brolin, and Margo Kidder. Non of these are for sale and never will be. So, if you ever find yourself in Toms River, New Jersey check out the house. The last time I showed somebody the house the owners were very hospitable and didn't mind the attention. Thanks for herein me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We should have seen the "Muppet Movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 13 years old in 1979, my younger brother was 8. Our stepfather was going to bring us to the movies, my older brother and I convinced our younger brother (much to step dad's disapproval) to see "The Amityville Horror". Stuart Rosenberg's vision comes to life, when a middle class family (The Lutz') moves into a beautiful home with a price tag that makes no sense. Soon things are not right, cold air and lots of bumps in the night force the family to believe that they might not be alone in this wonderful beach front home. The acting is good, James Brolin is quite believable as the dad, who's beginning to lose his mind, and Margot Kidder does a fine job (before she really lost her mind). Right from the get-go, the film has the creepiest music in film history, and we know we're in for a ride. About a half an hour into the film, my younger brother was turned around in his seat with his hands over his eyes, repeating the words: "We should have seen the Muppet Movie"! By the late seventies, the book was a classic and the film added fuel to the fire. This movie scared the crap out of all of us, even my big brother and myself. I own the movie and it has scared my children, as hopefully it will scare theirs some day. Maybe we should have seen the Muppet Movie indeed....</fullReview>

The parents and the kids suck!! And as another user mentioned, as a viewer you don't know what the hell is going on half the time. Spoiler: and how come its never explained why George Lutz looks exactly like the guy that killed his own family a year before???? I was so bored that I found myself laughing at the 70-ies haircuts. Lutzes and his wives brother. Other than that this movie stinks. Just like another 70ies-movie that has been remade recently: Assault on percent 13 which is even more boring than this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (1979)starring: James Brolin, Margot Kidder, Rod Steiger.plot: George (James Brolin) and Kathy (Margot Kidder) Lutz move into the famous Long Island home which was the place that Ronald DeFeo (or in the prequel's case Sonny Montelli) murdered his entire family, claiming to have been possessed. Throughout twenty-eight days, ghostly phenomenons take place, and soon Kathy and the kids realize that George is acting very strange.the good: I could care less if these events were true or not, I see this as a horror film and not a real life story. So I'm just going to judge it on what it is, a ghost film.The main thing I loved about this film was the characters and acting. James Brolin and Margot Kidder were great as the leads. Brolin especially impressed me when his personality began to change. I hear Margot Kidder was not happy with her part, that does not show, she plays it perfectly! I loved to get to know these newly-weds.I also enjoyed the subtle scares. This is not the special effects show that the prequel and sequels are, it scares us with what he hear and how we feel, there was the occasional glowy eyes in the dark but that's about it.The atmosphere was also very great, that house was creepy, inside and out!The directing is very atmospheric and the score is great! With all that what more could you ask for in a haunted house movie?***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better than the 2005 Remake!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you that have not yet seen either movie, think hard about which one you want to see first. It had been well over 10 years since I had seen the original and I remembered very, very little of it.Thus, we went to see the 2005 version first. The movie is a great horror flick in the sense that it isn't your typical everyday horror movie. It is the script that makes the movie great. Van Wilder, I mean Ryan Reynolds, was great in the movie and is becoming a blooming actor.Immediately after watching the new version, we came home and watched the original version on DVD.This is the biggest difference: The original assumes the viewer is intelligent while the new version needs to go to great lengths to spell everything out for the viewer.Some examples (warning mini-spoilers involved): 1) The clock: In the original, you see that he keeps waking up at a certain time, while in the new version, they show you the alarm clock stuck at that time from the start.2) The murders: In the original, you don't actually see the murders in a graphic fashion, while the new one shows everything. Psycho is one of the best thrillers of all time, yet Hitchcock shows no violence... his genius is that he leaves it all up to the viewers' imaginations.3) The babysitter: In the original, she is a geek with braces complete with matching headgear. In the new version, she is a hooch who wants to hook up with a boy much younger than her. (Though I must admit she was a cool addition.) :) 4) Characters: In the original, there are a bunch of characters that make up the core of the movie. In the new version, the number of important characters are reduced to a minimum. Once again, this is a way to play "down" to the audience as if we can't handle processing a larger number of characters.5) Supernatural: The original is much more religious in nature. The original is much more like the Exorcist or the Omen. The new version is more focused on the shock value. The new version is more like a Freddie or a Jason movie in that regard when comparing the original and new versions.And those 5 items listed above are just the tip of the iceberg.After seeing the new version, we came home and watched the original. The verdict?: NO COMPARISON. While the new version is very good, it pales in comparison to the original. The original just has a much better storyline and will leave you more scared, despite doing so with less on screen violence. The original is more "spooky" while the new version is more "shocking" and far less spooky.In conclusion, if you saw the new version and liked it, make sure to go and rent the original... you'll be in a for a pleasant surprise! And since the story lines are completely different, it is like watching an entirely different movie.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror is easily one of the best horror movies ever made, regardless of whether you believe the Lutz's story or not. It's visual effectswere not amazing but it still scared the hell out of me. Many horror movies today have spectacular effects but still are not scary or creepy in any wayex. The Ring, Darkness Falls, The Grudge, etc. The three ingredients for a good horror movie are 1)Plot 2) Good Acting 3) Good Directing and the Amityville Horror comes up short in none of these categories. And what these three do is cause it to stay with you, cause you to look over your shoulder when walking to your car at night and pick up the pace in a dark hallway. I put it up with the Halloween series for best horror pictures ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still bothers me to this day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in 5th grade (about 20 years ago) I had a friend say that he saw this movie called the Amityville horror...and that there were these eyes in the window that scared the hell out of him. Quite frankly, I thought that the name Amityville Horror almost sounded like a comedy. Well, a few months later, my sister and I were at my grandparents' house and I checked the TV schedule and sure enough, The Amityville Horror was on HBO or Showtime..whatever. So we decided to watch it. I figured it couldn't be that scary. Well..needless to say, at the age of 11 or 12, I got the wits scared out of me. I've noticed a lot of people on this board saying the movie was terrible, didn't make sense, cheesy, etc etc etc. The bottom line is, the movie is pretty cheesy when you compare to modern day horror flicks, and the special effects that these movie makers today have at their disposal. What the other reviewers are forgetting to mention, is that when a young, impressionable person sees this movie the first time, it is scary..period. The first thing I saw was that it was based on a true story...so that in itself, was scary enough. (I didn't know at the time that the whole thing was a hoax). But more important than that, there's something to be said about older horror flicks...especially those that were made in the 70s. Something about the way people look, and the sound effects that make these movies much more scary than they really are. To this day, when I hear those high pitched school girls singing in the beginning of the movie, or the devil voices during the priest scene, or in the basement...it truly gives me goosebumps. I also tend to be most affected by Satan based movies. He (or she ;) is the ultimate villain. The truth is, if I saw this movie today for the first time, it probably wouldn't affect me the same way, although, as I said earlier, the 70s horror movies do tend to scare me more than any others. So that being the case, I can only comment on how the movie affected me. Either way, if you're a fan of "devil" movies (i.e. the exorcist, the omen, etc) this one is similar, if only in that it was made during the same era.</fullReview>

For the famous movie that it is, people seem to forget all of the flaws it had. For one, there was no plot. Two, grainy photography. Three, bad acting. Four, no depiction of real horror. The only good thing about this was Lalo Shcirffin's score. And people don't even care about that. This is by no means scary, and by no means good. The story is completely made up. If you want a good haunted house film, you're better off with two movies that came out the year after, "The Shining" or "The Changeling." If your looking for horror films from 1979, ditch this piece of garbage and rent "Alien" or "Dawn Of The Dead." This User's Rating: 1.5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic, underrated horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Small spoilers. Based on a true story that was claimed by writer Jay Anson, The Amityville Horror is about a large house on the coast of Long Island where newly weds George and Kathy Lutz and their three children move into the house that they hope will be their dream house but it ends up in terror. Not aware that a murder took place in the house several years back, George and Kathy turn to their family priest Father Delaney who believes the house is haunted and performs an exorcism on the house. But the evil spirit in the house causes him to become blind and makes him very ill. George and Kathy with the help of another priest Father Bolen and a police detective they face the fears of the house, but not knowing the spirit is planning to possess George and then the children. Stuart Rosenberg's "The Amityville horror" is a great suspense tale that features some terrifying scenes (The discovery of the room under the stairs) some cheesy scenes (The monster at the window with glowing red eyes) and whether it's a scary or cheesy scene I'm watching, I loved it. And the score was excellent! 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-directed bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to laugh at many of the comments. For me too, The Amityville Horror was the first "R" rated movie and horror film I saw in the theatre (my parents took me when I was 8), and it terrified me. But it seems to be more than a coincidence--this film seems to be Generation X's right of passage for horror movies.**Possible very minor Spoilers below** (as if you haven't seen it)Watched it again and, as suspected, it's not quite the same experience. The script is awful, and the whole thing really doesn't make much sense. Much of it is incomprehensible for those who haven't read the book. Other parts are incomprehensible for everyone. And unlike the book, it has to play up the "satan/devil" angle to fit in with the 70's pre-slasher horror movie trend of the time. I challenge anyone to make sense of scenes like the one where Kathleen (Kidder) finds the newspaper clipping/picture of Defeo that looks like Lutz, or the scene in the basement where they see the face in the "red room". Speaking of, James Streisand looks great, but is AWFUL as George Lutz, the beleaguered man of the house who is slowly spiraling into madness because that's what the script tells him to do.I've made it sound like a terrible movie, and well, I guess it kind of is. But to its credit, it has a lot of effective stuff in it. It's really well-directed, making the film as good as the script could possibly allow. Much of it is creepy, and a few scenes are absolutely chilling. The famous "Get Out" scene is effective, and the scene showing the Lutz's go through the house with the real estate agent with the flashbacks to the violence that occurred before is very unsettling. I also liked the fact that we're not bombarded with special effects and action throughout the film. The result is often quite a bit of tension. What else is good? Margot Kidder is great in this movie. Very sexy and convincing. It's also fun to watch Steiger chew the scenery in an earnest, over the top performance that reminds me of Donald Pleasance in "Halloween." It's almost like he realizes that even Olivier couldn't pull off these ridiculous lines, so he might as well go for it and ham it up as much as possible. The scene where he's blinded is a hoot.So I would give it 2.5 stars out of 4. Turn out all the lights, curl up,and check your brain (don't even try to analyze the plot). For a true 4 star haunted house flick, check out "The Changeling."</fullReview>

I saw the Jason vs Freddy movie. That is a good example of how this world works today compared to yesterday. The only quality in movies today is film quality. As far as the content? The worst trash that basically just invades and exploits our minds. It can't just be a simple fright. Society has our children so used to violence on tv and in the news that they have to put extreme violence in movies to sell tickets(sellout society). What? Why am I getting political in this review? There is nothing you can do or see in this world without being offended and critical. As parents and mature people we need to stand together, not just against violence in schools, public, or overseas, but, also stand against violence in movies. I believe it will happenand I will be standing in the front of the line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and you have the long island hoax special! Came out during the golden era of horror movies. The Shining, Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Omen, The Howling, Carrie. This one, however, played the "true story" card. A tip for those who are struggling with mortgages during this down economy...ghosts live in more than just New York. Nothing like a bottle of wine to get the imagination going...make sure you get a good second rate author to hack a book, seal some screen rights, and of course sequel city. Of course tell every one you left all your belonging behind. Then go back (during the day of course, since the evil house likes rain and thunder a lot) and get all your belongings...don't forget the axe, that'll make a great ebay auction.The movie? Well, I think there is a great drinking game here somewhere. The music is excellent, ranks up there in the horror soundtrack hall of fame. Although it's nice to see evil progress in newer movies via semail and the internet, nothing beats the old phone call hang up...pure evil. Oh, and a portal to hell in the basement? Well, that's just plain priceless.</fullReview>

But there have been so many superior and and far more suspenseful films since, I found myself usually rolling my eyes. It's not the lack of technology that's to blame.

It has an awesome cast with James Brolin, Margret Kidder, and Rod Steiger as well as John Larch (from Dirty Harry and other Clint Eastwood movies). This whole movie is very creepy, from the beginning credits where the house is shown in the background to the end where George escapes with their dog Harry from the "alive" mansion! Lalo Schiffrin's music is also very memorable, ableit a bit tinsy at times. I easily place this title in the top ten best horror movies I've seen. Highly recomended for all horror fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real or imagined?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a short statement at the end of the credits to 'The Amityville Horror' which is the key to the conflict within the film itself. That statement reads, "characters and events have been changed to heighten dramatic effect", and it is indicative of the problem with any 'true story' to film adaptation - just how much do you twist the 'facts' to keep the viewer entertained? When you have a story that is, in itself, terrifying enough, it would seem detrimental to pile on the horror movie cliches just to get a few extra scares. Here, the makers of 'The Amityville Horror' have been slightly over anxious to use every one of those cliches. While it's clear that there is a long list of strange occurrences within the house, they have strung them all together with very little cohesion or continuity. So, while the premise offers much to a horror movie, the end result is only intermittently effective.It's the story's 'truth' that really determines how much one gets from the film. Much in the same way that 'The Blair Witch Project' loses most of it's scares when you know it's all acting, 'The Amityville Horror' too, relinquishes it's horror to some blatant audience 'stings'. It needs to rely on the credibility of the original story rather than it's crowd-pleasing histrionics. To some degree it succeeds with the documentary style day-to-day structure, and some of the 'quieter' moments, like the inverted cross, and the front door bursting outwards, are certainly chilling. But, as documentary it is too indecisive and , as horror movie it is too unimaginative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When I read the book I was scared, and the movie was pretty scary too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first read Jay Ansen's book about this house in Amityville that was haunted I was pretty freaked out. Then I found out that the book was a hoax for money and fame and now it's just a movie for chill's and kicks. I still like the book, it doesn't scare me like it used to, but it's still pretty scary for horror flicks...the goo on the stairs, the dog digging at the cellar wall, and the flys and the preacher. It was pretty good and spooky in it's own way, I liked this one out of all the rest of the Amityvilles, because they just turned the actual storyline around and went into Hollywood fame. I did like the Amityville about the Dollhouse that one was pretty good. The actors were good in this one, the dad was frightening with the axe and the children were cute, they didnt' go into much detail about the make-believe pig, Jody. I guess that was the glowing red eyes you see in the window...Anyhow I give it a 71/2 out of 10, maybe just because I've seen it a lot more times, because that is all they play on basic cable where I'm from. I have it dubbed too. Anyhow good movie if you haven't seen it, it will scare the younger generation that's for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Possible spoilers** I saw "The Amityville Horror" when it came out in 1979. I was a 14 year old kid at the time and I was quite taken by the whole thing. The entire premise scared me: the voices, the goo, the upside-down crucifix, the flies, the distorted "GET!!! OUT!!!"... Not to mention that, at the time, we all had heard that this was based on a true story and we all WANTED SO BAD to believe that it really was.Fast forward to this year, 2002. I buy the DVD, pop it in, welcome it again as I would an old friend... and find myself terrified again. But wait: I'm 37 and a Dad and a homeowner... This movie should have been called "The Mortgage of Doom"! As it turns out, I feel that this movie SHOULD be scary for grown-ups, a spine-tingling economic horror. I'm watching it and thinking: "Oh no! They sunk all their money into this! Oh no! Don't axe down the basement wall - think of the price of getting the whole thing up again! Oh no! The basement stairs were eaten away by termites! Oh no! The plumbing system has to be upgraded! Oh no! What will it cost to clean up the blood and goo from the walls and stairs?"You get my drift.Scary, scary stuff, man. Just give it a shot. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**!!SPOILERS AHEAD**!! The story of the Amityville Horror consists of a family moving into a haunted house where, a few years before, some people were murdered while they slept. For the first day or so after moving in, everything is fine; the kids play in the yard with the dog, and the husband makes love to his wife. Then strange things begin to happen; the wind blows stronger than usual, it gets cold in the house, flies buzz around, and the phones don't work. None of this is scary in the slightest respect, and we never even learn why this is happening. I guess this is just what haunted houses do. The script is exceptionally lame, introducing characters and situations that never pay off, such as the missing fifteen hundred dollars, the little girl and her evil imaginary friend, the murderer who looks identical to the James Brolin character, etc. Lots of strange things happen, but we never actually see anything scary, unless you count the glowing pig eyes in the barn. Something can be said for not showing the monster until the end of the film, such as in Jaws, but to never show the audience anything is a sign of poor filmmaking indeed. This film borrows a lot from the Exorcist, with the priests and the Columbo-like detective ("Fadda, could I ax you some questions?") and what not, but it doesn't add up to anything. I couldn't believe the film was over at the end. The family just packs up and leaves. That's it. Nobody dies, no ghosts show up, and the house doesn't even catch on fire and explode (a typical ending in modern horror films when no other ending is obvious). Sure, the dad falls into a pit of goo in the basement, and it's raining really hard, but that just doesn't cut it. And the old "Give-me-a-break-it-was-made-in-the-70s" excuse doesn't work because Jaws, The Exorcist, and Halloween were all made in the '70s as well. Surprisingly, the writer and director were not children (as one might suspect from watching this film) when they made The Amityville Horror. They were full-grown adults, aged 52 and 43, respectively. Yet they collaborated to make one of the slowest, most boring, most amateurish, and most childish horror films I have ever seen. Watch this movie only if you are an aspiring filmmaker who wants to know how NOT to make a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AN APPEAL TO THE INDUSTRY TO REMAKE THE AMITYVILLE HORROR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attention horror filmmakers, industry moguls, and anyone who gets paid to scare the hell out of people: In 1976, Jay Anson penned one of the most frightening and fascinating accounts of demonic persecution ever written. Despite the fact that the whole thing had been cooked up by a self-employed Long Island surveyor desperately short on monetary resources, the book version of The Amityville Horror still has the power to chill due to the documentary-style approach that makes its hooded demons and red-eyed ghost pigs seem frighteningly plausible. Unfortunately, the 1979 movie version sodomizes the whole point of the book and instead focuses mostly on the deterioration of George Lutz's mental state and Father Delaney's health. One insider at the time claimed that the 117-minute running time was too short to show all the events in the house. Well, good God, it doesn't take a Steven Spielberg to figure out that 117 minutes is more than enough time if they just took out the puking nun, 95% of Rod Steiger's scenes of him screaming profanity at his monsignor and being blinded by a falling piece of church statuary, as well as that cliched sequence with Brolin climbing up the stairs with an axe and coming close to using it on his wife. If they had axed those scenes there would have been time to stage that spooky dream sequence from the book in which the hooded demon has the face of George with his face torn in two, as well as the scene in which the same entity burns its image into the fireplace, in addition to the levitations. Not to mention the final night scene which was one of the most unnerving sections of the book and alone could have made this movie kick some major butt. Instead because of all the unnecessary decorations die-hard fans of the Anson book are left with two corny fly scenes, some glowing eyes,and a brief shot of a ghost pig in the window. And I know darn well that something pretty creepy was excised from that scene where the family is fleeing down the oozing staircase. Kidder throws open the door to the second flight of stairs and her and the kids scream but the viewer sees nothing. They get downstairs by the door and from Kidder pointing frantically to the stairs it's pretty obvious there's something nasty up there. I'll bet in some landfill in Hollywood there is a few feet of film of a pig ghost lifting Amy off her feet and trying to kill her or something. But does the viewer get to see anything like this? Hell no, because this film harkens back to the stone age of horror films when the Hays Office wouldn't let Frankenstein chuck the little girl into the lake in its obvious insistence that anyone who has read the book and not gone mad from the nightmares should still be coddled to like some halfwit who doesn't know the vomit coming out of Regan's mouth from babys***! But we are not living in such puritanical times anymore. This is the age in which Amityville can be redone in a way that will scare the pants off of even the most hard-core skeptics So this is an appeal to all horror filmmakers, especially the indies looking for a quick buck. If you want to make a NUMBINGLY SPOOKY movie that will gross in the millions and put your name right up there with John Carpenter and James Whale: REMAKE THE AMITYVILLE HORROR AND MAKE IT A MORE FAITHFUL ADAPTATION OF ONE OF THE SCARIEST BOOKS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY!!!!!!!P.S. One of these fine days, I have a mind to get permission from the Anson estate to write a screenplay based on the book and put that on the market.</fullReview>

However I did not watch amityville horror again until I became an adult It had me scared for years there are some houses in chicago that resembles that house on 129 ocean street in amityville alot and chills go through me every time I see those houses I think that movie was superb and outrageous with its terror moments thumbs up to the directing and the producers still today I only watch it once a year. * (THE ACTING WAS EXCELLENT) *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror is based on the late Jay Anson's best-seller focusing on a haunted house in the small town of Amityville in Long Island, New York. However, reading the novel and watching the film are very different experiences. I happened to read the novel after watching the film, and I felt the latter lacked substance at every turn.The film is about the Lutz family, who moves into the house a year after a young man murdered his family-of-six there. They get a very good offer on the house and move in immediately. What follows are many strange occurrences, such as doors opening on their own, the phones not working, the house always being cold, an imaginary friend who is really a ghost, and so on. As the movie progresses, the occurrences become worse and more often.James Brolin's portrayal of George Lutz and his progressive transformation from a nice, family man to a possessed, evil, murderous man is the best thing about this film. Rod Steiger's performance as the priest is a little over-dramatic and leaves something to be desired. Margot Kidder's talents are wasted in her portrayal as Kathy Lutz.The film spawned 7 sequels, with more to come, I'm sure. My rating: 6</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel, and despite the annoying commercial interruptions, I liked this. I recently bought the book at a used book store, and have yet to read it, but the movie was not bad.James Brolin and Margot Kidder play a newly married couple, George and Kathy Lutz, moving into an old house on Long Island that is said to have a murderous history. With them is Kathy's three children from her previous marraige. Things at the house are going fine, until a local priest is plagued with numerous ailments, including a vicious attack of flies in one bedroom. Then different things start happening to the family members, right down to George being seemingly possessed by the boy who killed his family in that same house. As things escalate even further, things get even worse, right up to the 25th and final day they stay there.The movie was alright. Not the scariest thing I've seen, but creepy. What impressed me the most was the acting. Margot Kidder and James Brolin are so realistic as a newly married couple, right down to the lifelike dialogue. There are some creepy moments. The scene of the babysitter locked in the closet while the little girl watches on motionlessly, upon orders from her "invisible friend" Jody, and when the flies stop attacking the priest (I forgot his character name!) and the voice tells him, "Get out!" That was very scary. The biggest flaw was the climax. The first half of it was fine, but the second half in which *next sentence fragment a spoiler* George goes back for the dog, is hard to swallow. But still, an alright movie, and recommended. Now I just have to get the courage to see the said to be horrible sequels....</fullReview>

It's very slow going and poorly acted. Whatever's haunting this house clearly doesn't know how to effectively scare its inhabitants, since it begins by backing up toilets, shutting windows and stealing $15. Not very effective since those things can be easily seen as accidents. The house itself looks imposing enough, but I wasn't scared once during the movie.The one good thing I can say about this movie is that the score was good. Other than that, it's a waste of time. I was surprised to hear that this film made so much money when it was released. Maybe people were more easily scared back then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror was the first film in a series of 7 or 8 films to grace the horror genre since 1979. George and Kathleen Lutz move into a creepy looking house, complete with "eyes" where murders took place. It seems that a year before, a young man killed his entire family with a shotgun after hearing "voices" in the house that told him to kill them. The Lutzes disregard this, thinking that nothing bad will happen to them. Wrong. Soon after they move in, cold winds start flying through the house, toilets fill with smelly black gunk and the walls bleed that same substance, doors get ripped off it's hinges, the youngest daughter starts playing with her new friend named "Jody", and George starts exhibiting a complete 360 degree personality change. After 28 days of living in the house, things got so bad that the Lutzes fled with nothing but the clothes on their backs. All of the performances were good, and the music was pretty creepy, although the ending with the dog was kinda lame. This movie isn't completely scary, but it does have it's moments. It would have been scarier if it was actually a TRUE story instead of a money-making hoax.</fullReview>

(with the cops surrounding the area) Amityville Horror is on the long side (2 hours for a horror movie is unheard of) Its coverage of events (like the imaginary friend Judy, the basement, and ooze is tedious and lacks action. (don't all the amityville movies seem the same? HOWEVER, this one is at least distinct--) The film has a feel of a (pseudo-)documentary, including screen type of "one month later", "thursday,day four", "The Lutz's now live in another state and have never returned to reclaim the house or their/its possessions." In this case the story strings you along wondering what will finally occur. Yet disappointingly, nothing does really happen. George Lutz's deterioration throughout the film and the way stress builds during the movie adds to the tension and wonderment, but running back to save the dog and falling into the well just isn't terribly exciting (something like the end of Amityville 3-D, without the fly, would have been more exciting). Overall the movie is worth seeing though as James Brolin, Margot Kidder, and Rod Steiger are credible in this Acadamy Award nominated (best original screen-play) story about a family moving into the Amityville, Long Island house, the priest that be-friends them, and paranomial activity that gets in the way. Based on the Jay Anson book and true events.</fullReview>

It must have held my attention somehow but at the end I couldn't believe I had stayed up just for that. By far the worst part is the ending - where's the climax?

The movie wasn't a total crash though. The way George Lutz deteriorates during the film is great. You can actually see his stress build through the movie. Overall the movie is worth seeing just to prepare you for the sequel which I feel captures your attention more so than this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The other day I had nothing else to watch so I decided to watch the Amityville Horror on the WB. I do not think I was ever so confused. This story makes no sense. First, they say the house was where a 'witch' once lived and it was where Satanic rituals were held. Next, it has the passage to Hell in its basement. Then they bring in the original aspect of the story, which was a guy killed his family in this house but the husband looks exactly like the guy! To top it all off, the husband tries to kill the little girl, Amy and assaults the wife and the wife wants to escape with him! The graphics were absolutely horrible, especially the giant pig. There is so many things that are positively awful in this movie that I can' even list them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scariest thing in this movie is James Brolin in his tighty-whities. EW!This is another one of those "it could have been really good" movies. Based on an allegedly true story, The Amityville Horror has everything going for it; a sinister house with attic windows that look like evil eyes, an infestation of flies and the gagging stench of defecation and decay, a secret room in the cellar, painted red and walled up. But NOTHING HAPPENS! This movie is BORING! Margot Kidder chain smokes and looks scared. James Brolin, he of the aforementioned tighty-whities, looks like an emotionless Neanderthal with nary a facial expression to spare. You can't really tell when he begins to descend into madness - he still looks and acts the same! I kept waiting for him to go out and club a mammoth to death for dinner or something. The kids are just too too pwecious, the priest is unintentionally hysterical and the pig...well, suffice it to say that Porky is scarier, especially with the whole No Pants angle he has going on. This movie is a wasted shame. We never get any explanations, we never feel threatened, we don't care about the family (except maybe the poor dog, who didn't ask to be in this wretched film) and the only part of the whole film that unnerved me for all of two seconds was the menacing bass voice in the sewing room, uttering the trademark line: "GET OUT!" Good advice, indeed. I mean, I'm assuming that line was intended for the movie-going audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I reviewed this for a large daily newspaper when it first came out, and my opinion hasn't changed. It is not scary. It is not particularly well acted or plotted. It is ultimately boring as hell. Brolin is embarrassing as an unbalanced husband living with his family in a possessed house on Long Island (AMITYVILLE II explains why the house is possessed). Perhaps the effort to make this seem real rather than imagined, since it is supposed to be based on a true story, did it in. Who knows? The book sucks too. Watch THE CAR with Brolin instead. Now that's scary!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film took in an awful lot of people when it was released in 1979. I remember that even In Search Of... had an episode on it. However, this film is nothing more then a cheaply made, poorly made horror film that is a work of fiction. There was a book that came out a few years ago called The Amityville Conspiracy that uncovered this hoax engineered by the Lutz's and Jay Anson the author of the book. The acting in this film is so bad as to be almost comical. It was almost like everyone went out of there way to be as hammy as possible. Rod Stieger is perfectly wasted. Margot Kidder and James Brolin are not the least bit believable as husband and wife, I don't believe it for a second. The only true part of this film sadly is the brutal murders that took place in that house.</fullReview>

Newlyweds James Brolin and Margot Kidder move with their children to the titled house and strange things start happening. A haunted house film for the 1970s that bores more than it scares. Rod Steiger is wasted as the priest who is fighting the evil spirits. Followed by an almost innumerable amount of sequels that fit in well with this cinematic dud. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the never ending movie, two hours of boring acting and choppy scenes. Spoiler! The baby sitter getting locked in the closet was the only scary scene, well that and when they showed James Brolin in his underwear. Yuck! This movie has lots of problems and the main one is redundancy. George is always complaining that the house is cold, yet you never see him putting on a coat, and you never see his breath. He's constantly fussing with the fire place and then chopping wood, sharpening the axe and always with the axe.Anyone who lives in a house, and especially if you live on long Island, there's no way you can heat a house that size with a fire place anyway. Evertime Margot Kidder goes in her kid's room, she has to close a window, constantly closing windows. I guess there's just something scary about an open window. The messy dialogue between the catholic priests was especially time consuming and wasteful. At one point their hollering at each other like football coaches, in some vain attempt to ham it up and make their arguments more intense. Eventually the priest is yelling is head off in the church and then some gargoyle chips break off and fall on him making him go blind. Maybe he shouldn't have yelled so loud. I found this movie really boring and was relieved when it was over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newlyweds (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) move into a house where a murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away.This is easily the most successful film ever connected with American International and Sam Arkoff. Even their Corman days cannot compare to how huge this was, just judging by the sequels -- without even counting the box office receipts. Whoever picked up and produced this title was brilliant. Whatever effect the book had on people, the film did one hundredfold -- who does not have that house's image burned in their brain, even if they never even saw the movie? I do like that there is not much focus on the kids. The remake tends to give the daughter more screen time, while here it is more like a subplot. A child-focused haunting film is different than an adult-focused haunting films, and I think it really comes out in this one.The Blu-Ray from Scream Factory is amazing and a must-own. Besides the improved picture and sound, there is a twenty-minute documentary with Brolin and Kidder that really hits hard behind the scenes -- from the Lutz family, to the ghost pig, they cover everything.</fullReview>

To begin with it seems like a dream house but slowly mysterious episodes shake the family apart such as a babysitter being locked in a room with no lock on the door and voices in the empty rooms and the family come to realise they are sharing their new home with some unearthly and evil demonic forces. A terrific horror film which builds tension brilliantly and shocks the nerves when it wants to. The filmmakers do an excellent job of showing the disintegration of the family's relationship as the horrific events drive them to near insanity.

		<fullReview>If you're wondering about it being "true"... Jay Anson, the author of the book, has since come forward with the "Lutzs" to verify that they contrived the entire story. So the truth is, no. The story is pure fiction.But if you are looking for a good horror story this is one to choose.The movie does not rely on special effects. The movie instead relies upon good storytelling. The original is better than the remake. For someone who gave a cheesy performance as Lois Lane in the Christopher Reeves Superman movies Margot Kidder's performance in this movie really stands out as one of her best performances. But the best performance of the entire movie goes to James Brolin.Although the actors in this remake gave a great performance they don't hold a candle to the original. 9 out of 10 stars (would have been 10 but they perpetuated the story as real for many, many years: I.E. - they lied).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts out with a family all being shot to death during the stormy night to set the scary tone. One year later, newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz and Kathy's three children from a previous marriage move into the same home the murders occurred. The day after they move in, a priest and friend of Kathly Lutz, Father Delaney, comes to bless the house. He makes his way into the sewing room, where he gets locked inside and gets terrorized by an unseen evil force, and is then demandingly told to get out by a creepy evil voice. From that moment on, Father Delaney suffers through a mysterious illness. After a while, we see George's personality starts to change and he too becomes somewhat ill. As George becomes more and more violent and ill-tempered, Kathy realizes they need to leave the house, but George refuses. Meanwhile, the youngest child, Amy, starts to develop a bond to her "imaginary friend" Jodie, who is later revealed to be a pig-like creature. Towards the end, Father Delaney gives his last hope of faith, as he tries to help the Lutz' one last time through prayer, but that doesn't end well for him at all. In the end, after a scary night, the Lutz' finally decide to leave the home.All in all, I find the movie to be the best haunted house movie of all-time. A lot of people may disagree, but everyone has different tastes, I suppose. Unlike the remake, the original didn't need fancy visual graphics to scare the viewer. This movie did that with something that wasn't even there. They left that up to the viewer's imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very creepy and atmospheric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not expecting this film to scare me anything like as much as it did, I don't get scared easily and I was 22 when I first watched it in the year 2006, it made me lose at least four hours sleep! It's so much better than the poor 2005 remake.The Amityville Horror is different from most haunted house horror films because it is much more mysterious and focuses on the real reason why hauntings are scary, it's the fear of the unknown, the strange, the unexplained. Rougher than having a house haunted by just ghosts of human beings, there is something far worse, an evil force possibly demonic in origin. I love the way that as the film progresses we see more and more strange manifestations and events, some of them are very bizarre, more so than in most haunted house films. Some of these are the horrible mysterious black substance, the appearance of flies around a window that seem to be able to attack people, the various visitors to the house that are made physically ill, the eyes seen outside of the window by Kathy in Amy's room, the huge teeth marks in Georges leg.The behaviour of George is very creepy, the way he becomes obsessed with the fire place and aggressively chopping the fire wood, plus the idea of someone being possessed and brain washed into killing their own family is just absolutely horrific. This is even more disturbing when you consider that the family is in danger of going to hell and not just losing there lives. These interesting and strange events have a negative impact on the family and they are gradually presented to us as the film progresses so we come to suspect that what ever is in the house is something very bad. As we get roughly just over half way through the film we hear about how the house is built on an area with a dark history of devil worship and sacrifice, I think this is a very intriguing connection with the events that go on in the house. I much prefer a horror that is distinctly supernatural in nature and The Amityville Horror is one of them, more so than most haunted house horrors.The structure of this film is very good and the intrigue and suspense is built up very nicely, the acting is very strong most of the time. There is little to no special effects in this film such as CGI which usually ruins haunted house films. I also think the audio tracks in the film are very effective and creepy in places such as when Aunt Helena enters the house and looks up at the shaking chandelier and when the blood is oozing out on the stairs towards the end. Other examples of when the music/sound tracks are distinctly creepy is when Kathy starts saying a prayer indoors and we see a mysterious breeze of wind blow over her and when the family are just about to leave the house for good and come running out of the front door, also at the beginning when Father Delaney is being attacked by the flies. Sometimes the music is a bit cheesy psycho like in places but on the whole I really like it. The theme music is the creepiest music I've ever heard for an intro and end credits music on a film, it really conjures up the feeling of a creepy haunting. The dialogue is great too "what I saw was not a cat" I really got the impression that Kathy was frightened. I really did get scared when that psychic woman was talking about how there's a passage to hell in the house, it really made my imagination go wild.One of the most frightening story elements in the film is the fact that this evil couldn't be beaten and the family had to just get up and leave. The evil was still mysterious when they left, and throughout their time in the house they don't gain any understanding of what they are up against. When George is able to come back to his senses after trying to chop Kathy near the end of the film, there is a suggestion provided that isn't something cliché such as a priest saying a prayer that takes the possession off of him, it's as if he just snaps out of it possibly because the sight of his beloved wife was enough to bring him back to himself. God knows what would have happened if the family had stayed there.There's so much to say about why this film is great but I don't fancy writing a book!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes ... for all the skeptics out there who thought that this was just another fictional piece of work.... no you're very wrong! The house at 112 Ocean Avenue does in fact have its history. I've read many accounts where the priest who went to bless the house DID INDEED experience those problems with the unknown presence who told him to "get out!" I really don't think a priest would lie about something like that.... trust me.I believe everything that the Lutzes went through for those 28 days and nights! And he wasn't interested in making a film out of all this just for the sole reason of wanting money! True... he made a little. But that was never his plan. He genuinely wanted to get the word out to the public as much as he could and I believe he did an excellent job of doing that. Sadly, Mr. Lutz passed on in May 2006 while Mrs. Lutz passed on 2 years earlier. We'll never know for sure what went on during those last few days there. Apparently Mr. Lutz didn't want to talk about it because he said it was "too frightening", and I believe him.I also firmly believe that the house was built on sacred, traditional Native burial land although the local Native Elders say that they don't know of any such facts. I think the burial site exists and that the spirits of the ancestors just didn't want anyone to occupy that piece of land because it was so sacred. Before the house was originally built in 1928, I think Native Elders in the area should have come forward to tell the builders to be wary of constructing a house directly on top of a burial site. Back in those days, people would have known more about the land and if it caused any problems for others before and during that time. Determining this is very important since it would help answer some questions that have been shrouded in mystery. I'm very sure that the Amityville Historical Society knows all about the history of the area before 1928 but WILL NOT expose it to the public for doing so may cause a lot of controversy. They would be able to see if there were any land disputes of any kind with the local Native American population. But that's a different matter altogether.ANYWAY...... I really liked this film and that's my reasoning for giving it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

The Lutz's and their children (Kathy's from a previous marriage) settle on an impossibly cheap, large and beautiful shore house. But 28 days later the macabre and scary happenings force them to leave&#x2026;leaving all their earthly possession behind. During the course of those 28 days, the family goes through all kinds of hell a room full of flies, demonic voices and a pig with glowing red eyes. What kind of past does that house have that would make everything horribly wrong. Based on a true story.Real or hoax, you decide but "The Amityville Horror" has all the trappings of an excellent haunted house story. Too bad that the filmmakers falter a bit with a lack of character development that also ends up stifling the actors in the film, that would have helped out immensely. A creepy music score (the one rejected for "The Exorcist") and several good set-pieces help out but the end of the second act kind of gets stale. A good supernatural thriller.Rated R for Graphic Violence and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original Amityville Horror:A house possessed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An entire family is murdered, with no apparent motive, by the oldest son. The Lutz family, headed by George(James Brolin)and Kathy(Margot Kidder), move in and are immediately greeted with supernatural occurrences. The house's evil presence doesn't like the company of anyone affiliated with the Catholic church as we can see by how Father Delaney(Rod Steiger, whose hysteria's at a fever pitch)is greeted rudely when he tries to bless the house. Kathy's Aunt Helena(Irene Dailey)is also given a unwelcome sickness which creates an unwillingness to stay in the house. Other happenings occur such as how the babysitter is locked in the bathroom while banging on the door in fear until her knuckles bled, a window slams on Kathy's son from another man, flies which plague Delaney and George, George's steadily declining physical and mental condition, and Jody, the ghostly best friend to Kathy's daughter. And, there's something fishy about that basement.But, the evil gives a considerable licking to Delaney who loses his sight and slowly, bit by bit, his sanity until he's just a formal shell of who he once was. And, George can not shake off the cold he gets when in the living room or his desire for keeping his ax sharp. The Lutz's marriage also is becoming effected by all of the torment brought on by the house. They soon find out through a friend named Carolyn(Helen Shaver), into the occult, that the Amityville home is built where a Satanist, John Ketchum resided after fleeing Salem. Also located in the basement is an ancient burial ground.Lalo Schifrin's chilling score is the best thing about this flick which is essentially about showing supernatural effects such as walls that bleed, doors that explode open, etc. At times, the flick is unintentionally hilarious such as when Carolyn is taken over by another and tells, through someone else's voice that the "well leads to hell." The film is a bit long-in-the-tooth and doesn't really ever quite get going despite building up an ominously declining Brolin who looks like he could snap any moment with that ax in tow. The score, however, provides a lingering unsettled feeling that gets under the skin. The house is also photographed quite well to bring chills particularly how the windows toward the top resemble evil eyes piercing at anyone who dares to draw near.</fullReview>

Believing it really happened has inspired ME in the past to pay closer attention to it but a fact-finding search will reveal that this story NEVER happened. The same is true for any Toby Hooper movie. Toby Hooper is a great producer but he twists the truth. Just as the Lutzs" did with Amityville Horror. Be more careful when reading labels and seeing stuff like "based on a real incident" or "based on true events".The Amityville Horror is a GREAT movie but the promotion and legends of its authenticity are based upon wishful thinking and good PR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky and Realistic Haunted House Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: The Amytiville Horror Director: Stars: Margot Kidder, James Brolin Review: There are some films you watch as a kid that scare you and stay with you and in your memory for the rest of your life. But then you watch them again and realize that you were a fool to be scared of that film, because now under your adult eyes you see its really not that scary. While other films remain scary even when you are an adult. The Amytiville Horror is one of those movies for me. Maybe that's just me, movies that deal with unseen presences and voices always had a way of getting to me. Somehow they feel more real to me.It's the story of a newlywed couple who buy there first house in the town of Amytiville on Long Island New York. They even know that the house previous owners were murdered there by their own son with a shotgun without any apparent reason, yet they go ahead and buy the house, they figure that what happened in the house before they bought has nothing to do with them. "Houses don't have memories" Boy are they wrong! The house is cursed with an Evil Presence that just wants to kill and torture anybody who even tries to live there.Basically it's a haunted house movie, but told from a slightly more realistic point of view. Its not there to wow us with its fx or showing us its spooks and monsters running around the house, the film relies more on what we don't see. The unknown. Something is there, we don't know what it is but its there, rocking the chandelier, moving the rocking chairs and spying through the windows. Somehow I found those little details scarier then any special effect, though I love a good special effects laden movie, I also admire films like Amytiville Horror because they can deliver the chills and shivers without the razzle dazzle. That ain't easy to do. Kudos to director for conveying that feeling of horror by not showing us everything.Strange occurrences begin, people start hating each other and fighting, things go wrong, kids start seeing ghosts?spooky things happen and with every passing occurrence the new home owners realize that hey something is very damn wrong with this house.One thing with religiously themed horror movies from the 70s, the evil presence, power, demon, or whatever it is that's attacking always seems to be more powerful then the good. Not for a moment do you think that the priest will get rid of the evil presence which is pestering the Lutz family. From the first scene where he comes to the house to bless it the poor priest gets his ass whooped. Every time he tries to help boom! The demons stop him some how and I find this element very unnerving because as a viewer you feel so powerless, you want Margot Kidder to contact the priest, so he can help her, but there's nothing you can do! The evil always wins. This film has this in common with films like The Omen, The Exorcist and The Entity.Also cool, is how the evil makes little things in the house go wrong, like money disappearing, interfering with the couples sexual life or making people want to leave because they immediately get a bad feeling as soon as they step inside the house. Whatever this presence is?its powerful and knows what things to do to disrupt the families happiness and peace. Its very obvious from the beginning of the movie that this couple loves each other. But that is put through the test as the film progresses.Good performances all through out here, the actor who played priest did a bang up job, specially with those scenes where he is in the church praying to God for help. Screaming to God for help. Also Margot Kidder (apart for being a hotty back in those days) did a good job of showing us fear. And her husband played by did a good job, metamorphosing into a darker, evil person as the movie progresses. Good stuff from everybody here.All in all a genuinely spooky film for those who enjoy a good haunted house film, told from a slightly more subtle point of view and that doesn't necessarily make it less horrifying.Rating: 5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary as Hell...when I was a kid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's is amazing what 23 years will do to a classic horror flick. When I was a kid, all I could could see was those glowing red eyes. They haunted me day and night. I swore I would never watch this flick again. Well I did, and well it was just downright boring. A few inspired moments (including the glowing red eyes) save this flick from a super low grade. Don't get me wrong, if you haven't seen it - give it shot. My grade: 5/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this first at the age of 9 and being freaked out for days if not months after. I rated this a 10 because of the fact that I remember being freaked out about it for so long.I hate seeing all these negative reviews of older movies. So often it seems the reviewers don't place themselves in the timeline these movies were made in. I would also be pleasantly suprised if any were to give a comparison/contrast using a movie from the same timeline.As far as I'm concerned, Amityville held far more "scare value" than both "The Omen" or "The Exorcist" by use of a decentralized, non-human force. Actually, as far as I'm concerned (for it's time) I think it ranks above "Signs".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was reading over the other comments on Amityville Horror. Yes it is a slow movie, but a good one. It is one of the best horror movies. It is right up there with Black Christmas 1974, The Exorcist 1973, Halloween 1978, and The Shining 1980. How this movie met not be the scarest one, but bring base on a true story make it a little scary. Not seeing ghosts fly around. Not having little girl's head turn around. Not having spirits talk to you and to tell you to kill your family. Not having those things in Amityville Horror made it a horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am reading all these scathing reviewsm and I just don't get it! I am a horror movie fan. I LOVE a good thriller. I am also an a overall movie lover of all genres. Additionally, I am a film maker. That said, this movie is one of the freakiest, scariest, well-acted, well-directed, well-produced horror movies of all time. Do people just have this need to bash things? Ever heard about if you don't have something nice to say . . . Whether these things in the movie really occurred to the Lutz family or was just a hoax, the movie itself is definitely scary - especially so if you think it might be real. The music is so chilling, it gives me goosebumps to this day. Margot Kidder is one of the greatest actresses to ever grace the screen. And, by the way, Rod Steiger was AMAZING! This is a truly great actor. People say he overdid the church scene. NOOO!!! He was acting like a priest who knew something evil was in that house, and none of his superiors would believe him. He was pleading to God with all of his might and every ounce of his faith to help that family get out before it was too late. People just don't get the fact that actors are supposed to act as though they are really in that situation. And, if you were a priest - a man who devoted your entire life to serving God - and you went to bless a friend's house, and the house felt evil and you became violently ill, and every time you tried to warn them, something would happen to stop you. On top of that, a young man had murdered his entire family in the same house a year earlier, AND a voice in the house had told you to GET OUT!!! Then, your superiots think you are crazy, and no one will help this family. It is your JOB as a servant of the Lord to pray for these people - to pray for mercy upon them, to pray for them to have the strength and the faith to save themselves. Additionally, the woman was a friend of his, so there was apersonal connection. Considering all these factors, how exactly should one act when praying in the church? I suppose they should be calm and collected? Or maybe he should've just toned it down a bit? I don't think so! If you were really in that situation, then you could make a better assessment. Until then, get over yourselves. What is it that you people don't like? Was there not enough blood (until the very end)? Did you need to actually see a killer to be scared? What makes this movie so scary to me is that you can't see what's doing this to them. You can't even be sure if it is really happenning. I'm sure this is how the characters felt. If anyone has ever been exposed to the paranormal, you know there are things in the universe we cannot explain. And, sometimes there are malevolent spirits. One thing we do know is that kid really did kill his entire family in that house. And the real-life George Lutz really did have an uncanny resemblance to the kid. Whether it happened or not, I just like to watch the movie and imagine that it did. That's why I watch movies - to pretend that what I am seeing is real. I think this movie did an exemplary job. And, it does rank alongside classics like "The Omen." In fact, I can't even think of an example of a better horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is a question to be asked. When we watch a movie we some time say "-o get away, dont go there" and stuff like that. This film is kind of like that (But in a good way). Maybe like many simular horror flicks this is not unique, but this story evolves very nice, and if you think of whats actually happening in this film, i start to get really scared of things.When you start asking yourself the questions above "-why dont they leave", the answer comes falling from the sky... well they paid all there money into the house, and come on, who believes that something supernatural can actually happen to you... really happen!?When you see a movie, time does matter in what mood you are in, and i was in complete harmony for a regular horror movie. This is by far a good film, there are a lot of horror flicks with good and bad themes but this is my NO:1 for the moment. If you have a dark evening free? See it......The story is about a couple who are about to buy there first house. They got three kids and they all seems to be happy for the first days. But evil is stirring in the house and they got hell waiting for them. The plot is fairly simple, nothing special. But it evolves very smooth and got that atmosphere of evil and scary stuff that keeps me in the chair, "-just watching the house gives me the creeps" someone says, and its true!How will it end? Why did it start?....will they all survive or are they all going to die? Who is Amy´s new friend Jody? Will the Priest Tom find the strength he needs? Will the mystery be solved?... .se it and find out.And learn the golden horror rule: dont start asking yourself how/why in a horror movie.... because you really just mess up an exiting story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still scares me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horror movie, whether it be fiction or non-fiction, is supposed to scare. That is its' job and this movie does that surprisingly well. There are only a few movies I have seen that match the haunting overtones of this film and none elicit the kind of debate this one does. I cant say whether I honestly believe all the things that went on in this house(supposedly), but thats secondary. Of primary interest is whether or not Im scared and by that measuring, it succeeds. On the notes of whether this is an authentic movie, it would be a stretch in many different directions to have someone pull off such a hoax, but its certainly possible. It is an equal stretch to have the things happen, since they would stand at the pinnacle of supernatural happenings. Both stories are equally convincing and not convincing. The truth probably lays somewhere in the middle, dipping into both for the collective reasonings. I do think that something supernatural happened for one simple reason. There were eyewitnesses, other than the Lutzs' who stood in front of a judge and swore under oath the happenings. That, for me, seems to be a prudent measure that all was not well at that house. Even if it were not true, it makes for a very good scare story, and everyone likes to be scared once in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate haunted house film ****out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my top ten horror films of all time. I love it. I know the actual case very well and while the movie doesn't show us everything that happened and makes up others, it still is an excellent horror film.Let's first bring up the subject of music. Music is a very important element in a film, ESPECIALLY a horror film. Lalo Schifrin did a fantastic job and is a shining example of film scoring.The acting here by James Brolin, Margot Kidder, and Rod Steiger are top notch. The cinematography and direction is excellent.As for the remake, that's another story and the review for it is a little longer because I do rant quite a bit.As for sequels, Amityville II: The Possession is a decent film overall, even though it exaggerates on the DeFeo story to the extreme. Amityville 3-D is a very well made movie and is the only truly good sequel, even though it is a complete work of fiction. But those are other reviews for another time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The House on Ocean Avenue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) "The Amityville Horror" would have been an average "Hunted House" movie if it weren't for the fact that a real massacre happened there back in 1974. Young 23 year-old Ronald "Butch" DeFeo quietly went berserk as he calmly took a shotgun and shot to death his entire family, six persons, some time after 3:15AM in the early morning of November 13, 1974. The movie isn't really that much based on the DeFeo killings but on the George Lutz, James Brolin, family who moved into the Defeo home a year later. George and his wife Kathy, Margot Kidder, and their three children lived in the Amityville "Horror" house for just three weeks and then left, taking their pet dog Larry with them, leaving everything behind but the clothes on their back and the van that they drove out of there with and, in the movie at least, were never seen or heard from again. The movie and book on the Lutz's experience at that house was so effective that Ronald DeFeo's lawyer tried to use the unprecedented defense that his client was demoniacally possessed to get DeFeo off by using an insanity defense.The movie has a number of shocking scenes but all and all it never really takes off and leaves you wondering just what's happening on the screen, is it real or is it the Lutz's imagination. We have the story of the Lutz's little girl calming to see Jody all through the movie and later Kathy even sees "Jody's" eyes in the night window that look like a pair of glowing oranges. Later George actually sees Jody in the window of his daughters room looking like a giant version of Porky Pig but whats the bottom line about "Jody"? Is she real or just an hallucination on the part of the Lutz's? There are also a number of scenes of blood oozing out of the houses walls and stairway thats so gross that it cause the Lutz's to slip and fall trying to run out of it, is that also real or just their, the Lutz's, imagination? The fact that the movie is said to be based on a "True Story" makes you begin to wonder if these scenes, and many others in the film, really happened. Were also told later that the Amityville Horror House was built on a sacred Indian burial ground by this Shawn Ketchum who was driven out of Salem back in the 1690's and settled on long Island. It's there where Ketchum used that site, that was a hidden red room in the houses basement, to practice Whichcraft and Satanism and it's that reason that the house was haunted all these years. Still up until the DeFeo murders, some 300 years later, nothing worthwhile or newsworthy seemed to have happened there?Besides what the Lutz's went through in the movie regarding the "Amityville Horror" poor Father Delaney, Rod Steiger, went through a lot more and he didn't even live there. Going to the house, at Kathy's insistence, to bless it Father Delaney gets attacked, after being locked in a room in the house, by an awful odor from thousands of flies who magically appearer out of nowhere! Getting back to his church Father Delaney tries to call the Lutz's to tell them to leave the house as soon as possible only to have his hand badly burned by the telephone! Trying to get his superiors in the church to believe him, and have a possible exorcism on the house, Father Delaey is told by Father Ryan, Murray Hamilton, to go take a long vacation and forget to come back. The poor man in a last act of desperation tries to pray for help at his church only to freak out and hallucinate a vision of the church collapsing on top of his head. We last see Father Delaney sitting on a bench in the park, a broken and beaten man, with his assistant Father Bolen, Don Stroud, trying to cheer him up by telling him about how great the sunset is which only will upset him even more since he lost his sight during his traumatic experience in the church where he thought that the world came to an end and in a way it did, for Father Delany.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Weird people."That's a quote from this 'classic.'I could never agree more...In 1974, Ronald DeFeo, Jr. shot &amp; killed six members of his family. The massacre happened in an old house on the river's edge of Long Island.One year later, a family of five (excluding Harry, the dog) moved into the house. Within 21 days, paranormal, possibly supernatural events took place in &amp; around the 'home' which made the family flee from the house in horror to another state.This film is based on the book by Jay Anson which is based on the supposingly true events above. What i'm saying is that this is an old fashioned haunted house movie. Regarded as a classic in the horror genre.Well, i can see why this is a 'classic'. Though the story is simple yet unoriginal the flick has its moments. But not enough moments. Anyway the location &amp; the house is really creepy. The atmosphere &amp; score is really creepy. This whole movie is really creepy. It also contains a scary scene which involves a babysitter. The direction is very good. The acting is fine. But there are no characters to care for. Also the film just drags that it becomes kinda depressing. The dull picture doesn't help. And the movie uses at least one cliché &amp; it was predictable at least two times. Yet the things that really bugged me about The Amityville Horror is that the not-so-developed characters do things that normal people wouldn't do. They also commit odd acts &amp; act in a strange way but that wasn't the case with all characters (-thank God!). Also the movie as i stated several times before is really creepy. Creepy. Not scary or even spooky. Can you say overrated? I can.I don't understand why this movie is more popular than the underrated but superior haunted house flick, The Legend of Hell House (1973). It's also very stupid that this movie has been rated 'scarier than The Excorcist (1972)')..........you just can't compare this flick to the others mentioned.I don't think that i could stand another viewing...2 out of five stars.PS: There is not much gore in The Amityville Horror. You get some dead, bloody bodies, a bloody scene involving an axe, gallons (possibly) of blood, pouring all over the staircase &amp; a little bit more. But it is a violent movie. People get shot, axed...but those apects of this movie do not stand out.Followed by a sequel, Amityville II: The Possession (1981).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I though this was a very average film to say the least. As I say it could have been allot better. I haven't seen the re-make yet but I have a feeling it is a bit better. I didn't find any of the film scary but I really did expect it to be. The concept (which is apparently based on a true story) is quite creepy and the house does look quite scary but they failed to make it a scary film. I noticed that this version goes on for 2 hours and the re-make goes on for only and hour and a half. Maybe in the re-make they cut out allot of unnecessary stuff. I also thought that allot of the 'scary' parts in the film are ridiculous. Like having a path to hell in their basement, which don't get me wrong would be quite cool! But it is just a bit stupid. I mean, just because there was a murder in the house years ago shouldn't mean you get all this weird stuff happening in your house.I was really disappointed with this film because it could've been sooo much better and I was expecting a classic horror film. I wouldn't recommend it as a horror but it's average as a film I suppose. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't the place to get into the validity (or more accurately, lack thereof) of George and Kathy Lutz's claims about supernatural events in their former home on Long Island. That being said, not even the Lutz's staunchest supporters can keep a straight face when discussing this patently ridiculous movie. Neither as suspenseful as Hitchcock, nor as disturbing as Last house on the Left or The Texas Chainsaw Massacare, the only thing this film has going for it, is the supposedly true story it's based upon. This film is shot in that grainy, dark 1970's color we are all too familiar with, almost ruining any attempt to create a creepy atmosphere (saved only by the incredible, eerie score by Lalo Schifrin) and the late, great Rod Steiger takes it a bit far as the priest although the other actors do a reasonable job. The main problem with this film is that it's poorly developed, with only a handful of truly good scenes that may make the hair on the back of your neck stand up (and only then if you're easy to scare). The audience is never pulled into the action or the suspense, the family never seems to be in any real danger, and the background of the house and why it's haunted or by what is never fully explained. This film could have been excellent if the filmakers could have decided whether they wanted a suspenseful, psychological thriller (a la Hitchcock, or Jaws even), or a demonic thriller (a la Exorcist). They tried to make both, they got neither.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While much of the account of the Lutz's case portrayed in the movie The Amityville Horror, its many sequels that followed, and the book of the same name, was proved to be a fabricated hoax, the movie provides some decent B-grade scares for fans of this era of horror movies.In real life, the Lutz's had financial problems paying the mortgage on their house and used the Defeo murders, (one of the few REAL things about the case.) to fabricate a ghost story that made them one of the most well known haunted house owners of all time! Most know the story: Newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz buy a supposed "dream home" at a greatly reduced price, although away of the Defeo killings a year earlier, the Lutz's believe that the home would be perfect for their family.Unexplained phenomenon begins to happen. George Lutz becomes isolated, withdrawn, and short-tempered. Toilets and walls ooze black goo, windows open and close by themselves, flies appear on windows with no explanation, and anyone with any type of religious background gets very sick when visiting or going to visit the house. The Lutz's young daughter sees and communicates with a spirit called "Jodie" that no one else can see. This was the original haunted-house story.The acting while corny is probably the best effort that could be done under the circumstances of a weak and muddled script with a proved mostly-fictitious storyline. When you refuse to acknowledge that this is a "true story?" and can accept the film as just a fun B-grade haunted house tale, you'll like it much better! Some scenes are actually funny! (i.e where else can you see a nun playing basketball?! LOL) The Amityville Horror is not a classic by any means, but it can provide fun for fans looking for a haunted house movie. I always try to watch it on repeat viewings.However, Everyone should be sure to avoid the God-Awful remake of this film with Ryan Reynolds as George Lutz. It's so far removed from any resemblance of the Lutz's story, that it makes the original film look like the Gospel truth!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If there's one good thing to say about this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is that Ron "Butch" DeFeo Jr will never ever ever in a million years make parole because of all the publicity the Amityville Horror krep has generated. I've seen the A&amp;E interview with him a few months ago and I can only hope the prison he's locked up in screens this movie in heavy rotation just to taunt him.Otherwise the movie doesn't have much going for it. According to stuff I've found online, Jay Anson did his book and subsequent screenplay from tape recordings (now sadly lost) made by the Lutz family after moving out as a sort of "debriefing" therapy. It would seem that he exaggerated what he was given for the book than exaggerated what he wrote in the book to make the screenplay. And still the movie is a tad on the dull side...Right off, I could imagine a more effective movie being made by moving the camera through empty rooms in the house as the taped Lutz narrative rolls with flash-cuts to emphasize the various "hauntings" - which by the way really don't seem much like leave the house and move out of state hauntings. Just leave an open book of Frank Gehry architecture on the coffee table and the demonic spirits would look for better digs in the Hamptons - nothing scares a possessed house like the prospect of being Frank Gehry'd - and he's remodeled a Dutch Colonial.Indeed the priest seems to be getting the worst of it - with Rod Steiger's JUST YELL IT REALLY LOUD method of acting, Jodi the pig was doing us a favor there. Given that the Lutzes had almost no contact with the priest during their stay at "La Casa Diablo" his tales of woe wouldn'tve figured much in their experience with the place. And you would think that a former Marine like George Lutz could've taken a little thing like a haunted house. I bet if R Lee Ermey had bought the place, Jodi the pig would be ham-steaks, pork chops and bacon by day 1 and 1/2. The movie would end in 5 minutes with R Lee's wife stacking the cupboards with cans of Jodi-spam.Incedentally the house has a curious post-script to history. One of the families that lived there from the mid-80s to the mid-90s lost a son in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center - he worked in the South Tower - which in theory gave him enough warning to GET OUT!. They were the ones that replaced the "evil eye" windows with square ones. They had sold the place to put him through college too. A Beverly Hills 90210 cast member, Christine Belford lived in the place with her parents in the early 60s. She had to work alongside Tori Spelling which I suppose was punishment enough...If you pay attention to the opening scene where Ron DeFeo is blasting his way through the house you will note that he fires first into what was the DeFeo's TV room (where he'd been watching a movie by himself), then into his parent's room before going upstairs to shoot twice into his own bedroom (he had the room with the "evil eye" windows).It should also be noted the "face" part of the house in the movie is facing the wrong direction. The "evil eye" windows and enclosed porch are on the street side of 112 Ocean Ave and not the Amityville Creek side.Obviously this is the result of having to use another location (Toms River, New Jersey because the Town of Amityville refused to let them film there). At any rate it photographs better to see the house from the river side. Incedentally they actually built a Dutch Colonial "slip-cover" over the house they used in the movie (which was an ordinary Colonial house) which got removed and put in storage between the production sessions of the first two sequels.The Toms River house was moved over by one lot when the owner opted to replace it with a bigger house to give to his daughter. It was painted blue and while it no longer has the third floor slipcover it still has a set of "evil eye" windows in the attic storey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tepid film at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must at the outset mention that I watched this film after reading Jay Ansons' book of the same name. The book was excellent - mostly because it was so factual, almost like an essay rather than a novel. And this made it all the more compelling because it was actually about something so unearthly as a haunted house.The film, unfortunately doesn't even begin to compare with the book. Perhaps it was good at the time it was released in 1979 (I really couldn't say) but it doesn't even begin to compare with modern horror like "The Ring". The storyline deviates from the book in a few places (which is to be expected, I suppose), but it absolutely lacks the gripping, real, gritty quality that the book possessed (a film having the same feel would be "The Blair Witch Project"). A good horror film is scary because it is very, very plausible, has good cinematography, has "wreack havoc with the subconscious" scenes (remember the fly on the TV screen in "The Ring"?) and has a good background score. Or, it is the simple sudden-loud-noise-make-you-jump variety. This film tries to avoid being the latter, but doesn't quite achieve the former. Had it been made to look and feel like a documentary, following the lines of the novel, I'm sure it would have packed a far greater punch. But stuck somewhere in between, it totally fails to scare you in any way at all - unless, of course, you are the kind to be scared by a disembodied voice whispering "For God's Sake, Get Out!", as the tag line says. One can but hope that the 2005 remake will be better. Of course, it would have to try quite hard to do worse than the original...</fullReview>

Sure, sure, there were good scenes, good times, but I still think it could've been better. My parents had watched it once, they said it was good, but still, it wasn't that spectacular at all. Nothing to be mad about, nothing to get excited for, nothing to hate. Just a regular, popular-yet-horrid horror movie with little potential. Still fun to watch the first time, but not after that.

		<shortDescription>A Been-There-Done-That Haunted House Movie Kind of Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes it's inevitable to show mercy towards the clichés in haunted house movies. The story lines tend to follow the same pattern: (1) A group of people buy a house, (2) Strange things happen in the house, (3) The residents try to figure it out, (4) The people finally get out after all the time they wasted beforehand. But I look for both old and new content to see what filmmakers can make out of their movies and how they set them in motion. Director Stuart Rosenberg does not develop much originality in "The Amityville Horror" which drags with an unstable story, bullet-ridden by plot-holes. Yet the horror in the movie should keep you from walking away.In 1974, a gunman executes his family in his Amityville home during the dead of night (3:15 am to be exact), supposedly motivated by the will of demons. One year later, the house is purchased by the Lutzes, a normal family starting a new life. They are aware of the history of their new residence but believe "houses don't have memories." After moving in, the residents experience paranormal activity and are threatened by hostile spirits during the course of their stay. Much of the Lutzes' testimony has been called to question and is still debated to this day. Watching this movie will create doubts for most viewers but the Lutzes have claimed that much of the events in the film are fictionally altered from their version. I'm a sucker for ghost stories but I also ask questions.The patriarch of the Lutz family, George, is played by a desolate and distant James Brolin. When he's not building fires and acting as inhuman as possible, he's scaring loved ones with his frequent mood swings. If that's not enough for you to start worrying, George regularly wakes up at 3:15 am. Is this the doing of evil spirits or just the problems of an insecure man? Well, according to George, nothing is wrong even if he and his family get hurt. Margot Kidder is cast as Kathy Lutz, George's wife, to provide a sympathizing character for us. She is the only voice of reason in the family yet remains supportive of her husband. But Brolin and Kidder fail to develop the chemistry of a relationship since there are minimal moments when they have the chance to build it. Nevertheless, Kidder pulls off with a decent performance and shrill screams.What wounds the direction of the story is the distracting focus on unnecessary supporting characters. The detective of Amityville (played by Val Avery) has no real purpose in the film; he's just a bystander of the events yet he is treated as if he might be a part of the story. But I think it's the through-the-roof acting and behavior that helps the supporting cast wreck their roles especially the one for Rod Steiger. He plays as a Catholic priest who is the first visitor to experience the horrors of the house and is the most followed character outside the Lutz family. Steiger's rambunctious yelling topped with his manic, complaining demeanor doesn't give us any reason to take him seriously. His performance makes him look psychotic more than angry and passionate.The logic in "The Amityville Horror" lacks a deal of common sense and, in turn, damages the storytelling. For instance, the spirits of the house attack guests more than the homeowners. Shouldn't they be terrorizing the people who live in the house and not those who merely visit it? But it is more baffling that some of the visitors would not even bother telling the Lutzes of their suspicions. It also seems odd that the spirits continue to inflict harm upon former visitors when they are nowhere near the house. I guess the dead are easy to offend and hold a strong grudge against the living. Despite its persistent shortcomings in cast and story, "The Amityville Horror" offers settings and scenery which are impressive for an independent, low-budget film. We see places where darkness cannot lurk such as a bright, lush sanctuary and then we enter the Lutz home. There, the evil finds refuge and interior shadows serve as decorative boundaries during the night. Moods of the settings are effectively reinforced by the music of Lalo Schifrin which swings back and forth from a childlike tune to a more ominous tone. The most iconic image in the movie is the back-end of the house. The design of the back resembles a half-finished Jack-o-lantern with a pair of semi-circular windows for the glaring eyes. Sometimes a red shot of this form gives the house a more sinister look. I would rather live in an apartment in Downtown Los Angeles than a house with a menacing stare. I would normally rate a movie such as "The Amityville Horror" with a 4/10 but, this time, I'll award it a 5/10 for the scare tactics. The horror, as a whole, relies on an unpredictable environment. Quiet moments are followed by enormous bursts of noise guaranteeing a jump or two. There are times when mere people or animals startle you in the most unlikely of places but when the spirits are roused (particularly the ending), you will be ambushed by many frightening sequences that can stick to you like flypaper.My Rating: 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelmed after the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the same regards as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I was disappointed in the original after witnessing the remake. Granted it is not fair to judge a film released in the 70s by today's standards, but the story-telling in this movie is jumpy at best. There are many aspects that are introduced and go nowhere and you are left wondering why they made a point to include it at all. They introduced and reintroduced the priests too many times with little to no payoff. I understand the contrast of the heaven and hell aspect, but the remake retells this story better and in a more direct and eery way. If you have a choice in Amityville Horror's to watch, check out the latest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was more comedy than horror. The realtor showing the house to George and Kathy Lutz could be mistaken for Mrs. Doubtfire, or Scott Thompson in drag (Kids in the Hall). James Brolin as George Lutz appears in an apparition as a cheap looking Satan with horns. The facial expressions of all adult characters are comedic as they try to convey the terror they are experiencing. The only true expression of horror comes when George takes a swing at wife Kathy (Margot Kidder) with an axe. The shriveled look on her face as she lets out a finger nail on the blackboard scream is truly terrifying - I would not want to wake up next to that...bluuuuhhh. The little girl, Amy, and dog Larry, are the best actors in this cheap and poorly made film which fails to tell with any accuracy the Lutz family's actual experiences as occupants of the Defeo murder house. Director Stuart Rosenberg must have been an Ed Wood prodigy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>too many things in this film are not true about the real amity ville event that happened to the family. It's not scary at all, there's nothing specially supernatural about the house other than the ghost girl, bloody staircase, and the psychological changing of George.I first got interested in this film after I saw a documentary about the house. According to the documentary, the priest who got mad in the film dies shortly after he left the house. The family called him when they started to feel sonething spooky about the house. The priest goes in then suddenly leaves in pain. Soon he calls up the family and right before his death, he warns them not to go in to the room he went in. One day the family's son goes into the room screams and the couple sees a teeth wound on his leg. This wound is on George in the film and never explains where he really got it from. In the real event, The sounded son declared the small lion statue came alive and bit him. Surprisingly the little lion had some blood on its teeth. This is really creepy This film is totally fake. Bad ending, no explanation for supernatural within the house. this film is a waste of time, very disappointing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every imaginable cliché of the horror film in supposedly true story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time the end credits roll on THE AMITYVILLE HORROR you feel as though you've been taken in by deception. Yes, it's based on a true story (at least that's what the Lutz family claimed in the book they wrote), but it has been turned into the kind of horror film that keeps repeating every cliché of the standard horror flick we've seen over the years.Menacing music, thunderstorms with cruel flashes of lightning, plumbing that doesn't work, windows with peering faces, a bottomless pit in the basement, stairs that drip with blood--it's all here so that everything that could frighten a family into leaving a house once and for all is on full display.The trouble is, none of it seems credible. Maybe it's the indifferent performances from JAMES BROLIN and MARGOT KIDDER and the kids, or maybe it's the hilariously over-the-top ROD STEIGER as a local priest who shouts over the telephone. Or maybe it's just that too much has been piled onto the story to give it the nightmarish horror the title implies. Whatever, it's a train wreck of a movie and nothing director Stuart Rosenberg does can do anything to dispel the notion that we've been had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diabolical post-Exorcist crap; the kind of film that gives horror movies a bad name. Supposedly based on real events, this is the kind of film that doesn't so much play on our primal fears as on our gullibility. The house the Lutz's move into is plagued by flies, black gunge in the toilet, doors that blow open and closed by themselves and windows that fall on people's hands. In other words what you might expect from any ancient pile. However, in this house several people were murdered, (and only a year before the Lutz' move in), so you can't blame them for suspecting that it's all down to witches and demons. Personally, I would have moved out after the second plague of flies.Nobody in this movie comes off well. Not Margot Kidder, who screams effectively enough to know she's in a pile of horse manure; not Mr Barbra Striesand whose eyes keep getting more and more bloodshot as the devil does his worst, and certainly not Rod Steiger who cuts the ham so thick you swear you're watching the whole pig. Diabolical and then some.</fullReview>

Books sometimes do not translate well into movies. All the actors did well with the script they had to work with. The story is unbelievable. When I was a kid these movies scared us, I could not watch the whole film. When one gets older they mature and I guess what scares changes. Maybe, all the years at the post office has harden me.

Strange things began to happen to the family and the house that ultimately reaches a breaking point within the family. Yes, that is Lois Lane in a shirt and knickers smoking a heater and that is Mr. Streisand toting an axe. Believe it or not that is Mr. Steiger wearing a collar and lugging a bible.Is it worth watching? Just once so you'll know to never watch it again. Why did it get such a reputation?

		<shortDescription>Put some pants on, Brolin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror if nothing else is a perfect example of what happens when yelling is substituted for acting. Our (supposedly true) story deals with a family moving into a creepy old home on Long Island and the terror which ensues. It seems that the last family to live there was murdered by one of its members, and he looked exactly like the guy whose family just moved in! (gasp) The house also rests on what was once the spot where the Shinnecock Indians housed their insane tribal members. Oh, and there is a passage way to hell underneath the basement stairs, too. Take my word for it: This is not a good house to live in!Simply put, this film is not very good. James Brolin as the family patriarch is mean-spirited, dour, and looks like a zombie. He spends most of his time chopping wood, sharpening his ax, and walking around in his underwear. His wife is well-played by Margot Kidder. She seems the most upbeat of these characters until the whole experience overwhelms her, also. Rod Steiger shouts most of his lines, and basically turns in an unconvincing performance until he goes blind. But by far the worst performance is turned in by the woman portraying the psychic girlfriend of Brolin's employee. (Helen Shaver, I think). Overall, nobody is that convincing.The effects are pretty hokey throughout. We see rooms full of flies, a black cat, a pair of fake-looking red eyes, and blood dripping out of the walls. None of these things are remotely scary.There is one legitimately frightening scene, though. In it, a babysitter is trapped in a closet. She repeatedly pounds on the door to get out until her hands begin to bleed. Then, the light goes out on her and she lets out an anguished scream. For some reason, that scene scares the heck out of me.Alas, one scary scene does not a horror film make! I'll give it 4 of 10 stars.ps: another classic line delivered with a shout:Brolin sitting in a chair begins yelling "I'M COMING APART!!!!!!!!!" for no discernible reason. There are plenty of better horror films to watch this time of year.So sayeth the Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Brolin Sure Can Sharpen An Axe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was amazed that this movie had attained such status in the horror genre. The fact that something like this movie could spawn so many sequels is amazing; I do understand the appeal of James Brolin sharpening an axe for what seemed to be half of the movie, and the desire to see more of him with a beard (as hard as that would be)...but really beyond that the movie really didn't do much; however, I did enjoy how the "Ultimate Evil" house stole money...that really proved to me that the house was evil.Now I shouldn't be too critical as I was not born when this movie was made (thus never seeing it in theaters in all of its axe-sharpening glory) but the fact of the matter appears to be that this movie was used to get a whole bunch of horror movie clichés thrown together in one big yawn-filled feature... Even though it is filmed in such a straight forward, documentary-esque style (with little artistic appeal beyond those glowing windows and the repetitive shot of the house with some flowers), there were so many different story lines that were not pursued that one is left to ponder a great deal of the film, that apparently happened for no reason, after its over (whether you wanted to or not).I can understand how some of the effects may have frightened viewers at the time, but what surprises me is how this could even be seen as shocking when it is released 6 years after The Exorcist (and two years after The Exorcist II, which...yeah we'll focus on the first one). Did no one go to see The Exorcist, as it looked too scary and just went with Amityville? Well I guess if you're terrified by James Brolin chopping wood and a cat, this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew I had to try this film because I had seen the spoof moments in Scary Movie 2, oh, and because it is better to see the original before the remake, from director Stuart Rosenberg (The Drowning Pool). Basically newlyweds George (James Brolin - who I saw screen test to be James Bond, when Sir Roger Moore threatened to leave before Octopussy) and Kathy Lutz (Superman's Margot Kidder) and their three kids have found their dream house, and they bought it knowing it had a history. Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) believes the house is haunted, but he can't do anything to help the new owners when he becomes blinded and ill because of the evil spirit. The couple soon have the evil of the house endangering them, and they try to get the help of Father Bolen (Don Stroud), knowing the spirit will possess George, and then the kids. It is a little too chatty for most of the film, but it makes up with the nasty bloody moments, including the staircase and walls themselves bleeding. Also starring Natasha Ryan as Amy, K.C. Martel as Greg, Meeno Peluce as Matt, Michael Sacks as Jeff, Helen Shaver as Carolyn, Val Avery as Sgt. Gionfriddo, Amy Wright as Jackie, Murray Hamilton as Father Ryan, John Larch as Father Nuncio and Irene Dailey as Aunt Helena. I don't know if the fact that it is based on a true story is true, but it is not a bad film, and I can see why it was a cinema hit, with good performances from Brolin, Kidder and Steiger, and a very good opening and closing theme tune. The spoof moment of Scary Movie 2 by the way is the priest in the toilet with flying going on his face as he does a blessing. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Music - Original Score for Lalo Schifrin. Okay!</fullReview>

Throughout the movie, I tended to laugh more than be frightened.Personally, it did not help that I used to lived a few miles away from where the movie was set.

		<fullReview>From what I hear The Amityville Horror seems like the definition of a marmite film. Opinion is neatly divided into those that love it and those that hate it. I side with the latter.Its about a haunting but at the same time isn't really about anything at all. There is no structure, no real beginning middle and end - no POINT to it basically. Its boils down to a series of set pieces which are meant to be scary. Maybe the film is so subdued because its supposedly based on true events. I say supposedly because its obvious to anyone who has read into it that it was an obvious hoax. If the Lutz's story had any more holes in it you could use it as a soup strainer. And if you are in the habit of making stuff up then at least go whole hog and make something remotely scary. Beardy men chopping wood and evil pigs (yes pig) are not scary. Neither is someone tampering with your front door. That just makes you want to install a burglar alarm not consult your bible.However the most annoying thing about it is that it had such great potential. That was one seriously creepy house. The shot of it standing there in the dark with those quarter moon shaped windows looking like eyes alone demanded a better film. Thankfully this years remake sounds like it is a far better film and does the haunted house justice.Don't even get me started on that sequel with the lamp stand....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk About A Movie That Needs A Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: *1/2 out of ****.If there was ever a film that needed a remake, Amityville Horror is it. I cannot believe I heard somewhere that this was a classic(WTF????) To be fair, the film is not completely without merit, but the bad significantly(and I mean significantly) outweighs the good.So whats the problem with the film? The first problem is that the pacing is uneven. At first, the film moves slowly but not too slowly. However, at other times it moves at a glacial pace and threatens to put the viewer to sleep.The acting is also highly uneven. However, someone should be given an A for effort. That person is Margot Kidder. Kidder gives a convincing performance but it belongs in a better film. James Brolin gives it a try and is occasionally creepy, but a bit stiff on other occasions. Everyone else in the film is forgettable.The biggest flaws in the film are its overlong running time and a meandering script. First off, there is some useless material in the script. The scenes that deal with Rod Steiger's character. Are they really necessary at all? They just seem like a way to get the movie a nearly full two-hour running time. They could have been excised and nothing would not have changed. It would have made the film a little more bearable.Also, who the hell thought some of this sh*t was scary? Lots of Flies? 1500 dollars just disappearing? I do not find any of that stuff scary. What the hell would a house want with 1500 dollars? There is a scene where the babysitter is trapped in a closet that is a little creepy. However, then there are two ridiculous scenes. The Red Eyes? That could have been a creepy scene but it comes off as rather corny. The Psycho-type music is jarringly out of place. Also, the ending fails to generate any tension. What the hell is that thing in the addict? I heard somewhere it was a pig. Again, thats not scary.Amityville Horror does have a nice amount of atmosphere. It at least got that right. A remake is in the making and it would be interesting to see if the filmmakers could do some improvements. It really needs alot. Amityville Horror is not unwatchable but I cannot find a good enough reason to recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the classic horror movie I was expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing The Amityville Horror as a classic example of the genre in the 70's. What I got was an incoherent,flaccid mess. Amityville wants very desperately to be scary and almost delivers at times but is sunk by the nearly glacial pace of the movie and is forced to fall back on cheap scares like startling you. There are times where the movie is a bit creepy but that doesn't carry over into the next scene. Rod Steiger just seems to be coasting here, Margot Kidder is just annoying, and James Brolin just seems stoned. The kids were an unneccesary addition to the flick by the way. I was just straight out disappointed. This movie sucks and doesn't live up to the hype. Bottom Line: If this is on cable then go ahead and watch it if you really feel the need but don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I rented this one last Halloween, and wasn't sure what to expect from it. It got some bad reviews, but I thought if some horror fans liked it, I would too. Man was I wrong!I won't get into the part about whether or not is real, I frankly don't care. The fact is, it's so boring! In case you don't know it's about some family that moves in a house where a multiple murder took place some years earlier. The film plays like a low-rent version of "The Shining," as the father (James Brolin), under supernatural influence, finds it more and more difficult to resist his urge to slaughter his family.For the most part, "The Amityville Horror" slogs on for two hours, with few breaks in the monotony. Rod Steiger is embarrassingly over-the-top as a priest, but at least he distracts from the tediousness.Why this stinker spawned all these sequels is a mystery for the ages.* (out of ****)Released by American International Pictures</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, boring, unscary horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I can imagine this film was ever popular was that it was widely believed to be based on a true story. Well, Jay Anson's "non-fiction" book was a ludicrously exaggerated account of the Lutz family's claims that their new house was haunted. And the family later admitted the whole thing was a hoax!When stripped of the non-fiction designation, what are we left with? A boring, unscary movie about family members who are always vaguely unpleasant to each other, even before the allegedly evil house starts possessing them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sub-par haunted house movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 10/23/2007, 4 out of 10(Dir-Stuart Rosenberg): Sub-par haunted house movie supposedly based on a true story. The movie starts out with a preview of what happened a year prior when a 20-year old kills his entire family apparently without a motive and claiming that voices told him to do it. A new family enters into this steal-of-a-bargain house not caring that the murders happened just 1 year ago. Of course, strange things start happening like the typical church-associated person not being able to enter the house without getting sick, flies appearing at various times for no apparent reason, the daughter picking up an imaginary friend that tells her things that she shouldn't know otherwise, and a secret bricked-up room in the basement that holds "all-evil!!" The father and husband, played by James Brolin, gets physically and mentally sicker as each day passes, boiling up to a point where you know he's going to go off his rocker. There is really nothing wrong with the performances in this movie, but the story gets increasingly more far-fetched as it goes along including an over-the-top scene where an empathic-type woman screams out that the basement extra room is a DOORWAY TO HELL!! We also are given hints that the house was built on an old Salem witchcraft burial site which increases our perception of it being an evil place. OK --- so it's evil -- we get the point, well why don't they just burnt the freakin thing to the ground!! Of course, they don't, and as viewers we have to bear through all the typical haunting-house trappings until the very end. How this movie spawned so many sequels I don't know... I think it probably was just the "real story" advertising that hooked the viewers -- I personally am not looking forward to viewing any of the sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the point of even making this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently decided to rent the Amityville Horror hoping for some classic horror viewing. Despite reading mixed reviews about the film I was hopeful that I could look beyond a few flaws and still appreciate what The Amityville Horror had to offer. If only.Two hours later I was left not only wanting a refund, but more importantly an explanation of what I'd just seen. The Amityville Horror can be summed up in two words "zero plot". The film throws numerous characters, subplots, and strange happenings at us, yet never once makes any effort to piece them together in any sort of coherent way. No, this isn't one of those films like Donnie Darko or 12 Monkeys where multiple viewings and a bit of self assessment are needed to put the pieces together, this film plain and simple doesn't make any sense and no amount of viewing will change that..The main characters are never meaningfully developed and the supporting characters have little or no relevance. I came away without feeling anything for anyone. What is the point of the suspicious police chief for instance, George's recent religious conversion, the mysterious disappearance of the wedding money, George's business troubles, etc? Why even mention these things if you're not going to use them to advance the plot or develop the characters? It's as if the film makers were given a checklist of all the supposed occurrences at the house and then proceeded to randomly cram as many of them as possible into the film for the sole purpose of eating up time. The Simpsons Halloween episode, which parodies The Amityville Horror, is scarier and more interesting than the actual film. Know why? Because it focuses on and develops the paranormal events, instead of wasting time on a bunch of pointless subplots which have no relevance to anything and contribute nothing to the story. Why doesn't the house continue to say "get out" and harass the inhabitants instead of saying it once than abandoning a potentially great concept? And let's not forget the infamous "pig in the window scene" or should I say blip in the window. For all the time put into hyping "Jodie" this is the closest thing we get to a payoff. Is it real, a hallucination? Your guess is as good as mine. What I do know is that the thing occurs so briefly and obscurely I couldn't even tell what it was. It wasn't until I did some research on the real Amityville events (in a vain attempt to make sense of this mess) that I heard about it.The pacing of the film is horrendously slow. Not to say that slow pacing is always a bad thing, it can be a very effective way of building suspense before the big horror payoff. The problem with The Amityville Horror as I've stated is that there is absolutely, "No Payoff". For 2 hours I waited patiently for something, anything, to happen but nothing did. The only things in this film of any interest were the bleeding walls (more weird than anything else), the voice saying "get out", and the babysitter getting locked in the closest. Nothing was really scary and I found myself struggling against boredom the majority of the time. Case in point The Amityville Horror = Boring not Suspenseful.As for the acting, it is cheesy, unnatural, and completely unconvincing. It ranges from James Brolin's boring lifeless portrayal of George Lutz (perhaps he realized he was in a stinker?), Rod Steiger's ridiculous over acting, and worst of all Helen Shaver's mind numbingly bad performance as the psychic girlfriend of George's business partner. Granted the script's dialogue is pretty lame to begin with, but nonetheless terrible acting.In my opinion the only redeeming thing about The Amityville Horror is that the camera work is actually quite good. The film is very effective at capturing the menacing image of the house against the calm fall environment of Amityville (probably why the image of the house became so infamous to begin with). The film also makes uses of a wide variety of interesting and creative camera angles. Unfortunately a few nice visuals here and there can't carry the rest of this mess.Maybe I'm missing something, but I just can't for the life of me understand how anyone could honestly like this film. Why The Amityville Horror isn't lost and forgotten to time like so many other crappy horror flicks, we may never know. Forgot this stinker and stick to films like The Shining, Alien, and The Evil Dead if you want a good horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ROOSTERZ REVIEW This is a real disappointment to the horror genre. It really is sad that this scared people back in 79. The movie has quite a lot of boring parts in it and it seemed like 3 hours to me(117 minutes). There are no scary parts in it the only thing that happens is he gets angry sometimes, how do we even know he was possessed he probably just has a mood disorder. The only part in it where i was semi thrilled is were he's carrying the axe around and kills his son but it's only a dream by his wife.Final verdict Really really really boring, Stay away from this movie it is a drama not a horror.Rated R, Some Violence some language and sexual situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can a movie to a decent remake be so boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the remake was decent, and better than most of the films that came out this year. I decided to give this movie a try, and believe me it was a bad choice. I got so bored of this movie, and fell asleep while watching the first half hour. Margot Kidder was dreadful in this movie, but she did look sexy though. The lead actor was boring, and not convincing as a man who is controlled by the mansion. Rod Steiger is totally wasted here, and looked like he only wanted the money. I would suggest skipping this poor excuse of a movie, and going straight to watching the remake when it comes out on DVD, because I can assure you that it's a much better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no real horror in this 1979 flick, all be it deemed a classic?? I personally have no idea why. Two boring hours, with the cheesiest effects ever attempted, a movie that made me crave a refund?? I can honestly say that I was disappointed with this movie. It wasn't the movie I was hoping for. And in addition, I have not seen the remake yet, but I hope they've juiced it up a bit more. James Brolin and Margot Kidder star as newlyweds who move into an empty home on Long Island, and are gradually affected by the legacy of a murder committed on the property. The most horrifying part of the movie in my opinion, was the totally unnecessary sight of James Brolin approaching the camera in his underwear?? three times!!!! You'll end up watching this "Horror" flick from a distance, instead of feeling involved, which I'm sure was intended.If you do rent this one, wait?? if you buy this one, put it on the shelf and leave it there, better yet?? don't buy or rent it, it's not worth the lint in your pocket! There are many, many worse ways to spend two hours of your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. So numbingly dull if defies description. I watched this in bed while sick on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and I allowed these two hours of my life to be taken away. I promise, I will one day make up for that 2 hours. James Brolin was decent in "The Car" but appears in this with absolutely no direction or guidance. Does Streisand know about this movie? Does she know about "The Car" as well? Rumor is that there will be a sequel to "The Car" but the mystery is whether or not she lets him do it. I wonder if she would have allowed him to do "The Amityville Horror." I incidentally drove past the actual house, like a million other chumps, because a friend I was with at the time from around there knew where to go past. Glancing at the house was actually still not as dull as this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would You Believe This Movie Was A Hit?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had one of my students research the Amityville hoax as an exercise in critical thinking, and he wound up watching the movie as part of the project--poor kid. He told me, and I must agree, that the scariest part of the film is when the occultist neighbor woman exposes her teeth during one of the "red room" scenes. They were horrifying, and they haunt me to this day. The rest of the movie, well, doesn't. In some ways they would have been better off if they hadn't played the "It's a true story" card, but even as a fiction it's derivative and at times silly (do you notice how little time they seem to spend working on the house, dealing with utility people, or shopping for new housewares). Also, when the house spills blood or black goo all over everything, they never seem to have to call carpet cleaners or even give the walls a good once over with a sponge (and wouldn't some of that stuff prompt an angry call to the Realtor?) The Lutz's and their ghost-writers, the only ghosts involved in this story, never really seemed to think this sort of stuff through. The only other frightening part of the movie is when the house, presumably, rips off George Lutz for a cool grand. I can't blame the house for doing it. Apparently it repairs all the crap it breaks on its own. It must cost. Still, it puts Lutz and his family in desperate economic straits, and that was something everyone feared in 1979. I think Stephen King suggested calling this movie "The Terror of the Shrinking Bank Account". It might have been better. As it is, we have to chalk it up as yet another thing we can't believe was popular in the seventies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror is quite bad. It's boring, pointless and plotless. However, the acting is O.K, same with the music, and it will provide fans of the supernatural with some shocks. The scariest thing about it is the amount of money it raked in. It had no stars, or anything a good movie needs. Maybe it was because it felt like a good movie. It wasn't laughable, too, but it wasn't scary either. You may be able to sit through it on TV, because at least you think something good will happen next. What could have been a good movie turns into a forgettable mess. Just rent The Changeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's assume you want to make a film called Amityville Horror. First, you get some pointless scenes from whatever B-movies available then, add some corny religious symbols from the The Exorcist, an uncalled for nudity scene from Rosemary's Baby and finish with a theme music from one of those lovely 1970s porn movies!! I mean seriously, every time that stupid music starts "Laa laa la la laaaa la" I expect the characters to start taking off their clothes then have explicit sex while speaking in dubbed German language!! I will not speak about the actors because they were hideous. The only good thing was that the lead female looked like Courtney Cox. Just watching any of them acting 'fear' on their faces made me laugh. A performance directly out of a school play.What I'll speak of is how I did not find a single scene that had a point, one of those movies where cutting off 30 scenes won't make any difference. What was it with the aunt escaping? What with the friend's wife deciding to stay in the car because she senses a "presence"? What was it with the priest suffocating and fleeing the house? Were the family the only ones who could not feel the "presence"? So, the bad guy is a talking house, which could send bad vibes to scare people away, release some foul smell that brings flies and gives people breathing problems. But unlike other lame haunted houses that could only effect those in the house or around it, this talking house can effect stuff far away from it's location including making cars go banana... Makes you wonder what's stopping it from taking over the entire world, especially that it can talk, make phone calls and probably dance too! Still, that amazing house could not kill anyone, did not order anyone to do anything and had no purpose what so ever with all that insanity.You gotta love the explanation that psychic woman gave at the bar, although it did not help me or anyone else understand either. Here is what she said and please tell me if there is anything in it that has something to do with another; * John Ketchum * They ran him out of Salem for being a witch.* he built his house exactly where you're living.* You're living on some sort of special ground.* devil worship...death... sacrifice.* Britney spears... Ipod....Breasts.....British Airways OK... OK, I made that last line up, but did you feel anything wrong with it? Was it any more random than the previous ones? What on earth was that? What was that pit in the basement with faces appearing in the air? What was the well he was asked to search for? Why didn't he search? Who is Jody? What was she trying to accomplish? Shouldn't she had some purpose like catching her killer or directing them to her body for proper burial? Why did the wife tell him that she saw his picture in the newspaper from the past year? And why did he accept this? Was he the one who killed the family? How did he escape prison? How did he join that new family and why didn't the policeman recognise him? What was that confrontation between the clergymen? What made the statue on the wall attack the priest? Why leaving him blind? Why did he choose to live in the park? What's the point of the policeman following the shorty to the priest's location? What did we get from this? Where did the friend and his wife disappear after the discovering the pit in the basement? Why did the babysitter get locked in the closet? Where did the money go? Oh, wait... I might have found an answer for that last one, the house probably needed the money to buy crack !! See, exactly what I've said at the beginning, random scenes, totally pointless, none of them is connected to the other and none was related to anything that followed.I called movies stupid, I have thrown DVDs in the trash can, I have successfully got refunds for movies I did not like and called others crap and worse, but Amityville Horror left me with a feeling I never had before; HATE ! I hate and despise this movie for being such a worthless waste of space, I hate the fact that I have paid real money for it, and I hate it that since The Exorcist every cheap movie used some religious symbols that every time were entirely out of place and looked dumb and meaningless.It is beyond me how this was remade in 2005, but as far as I'm concerned, I will try my best to forget this insult and hope you pray for me to succeed. Now, don't get alarmed if you find your crosses hanging upside down, just scream "crappy movie in da-house!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hello? We're being attacked by harmless bugs and bad plumbing! ...stop laughing!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lutz' are newlyweds that move into a house. People died there a year ago... still, it's a reasonable price(no, really, that's their logic). Occasionally, the real estate agent is interrupted by gunshots killing the other family. This sets the tone for the rest of this... in other words, it tries too hard, and it basically isn't eerie(partially because there's next to no normalcy) or unsettling. They stay there for weeks, ignoring the supposed supernatural phenomena... then again, those are that regular flies gather in one area once or twice, that toilets flush with black goo and that the phone apparently doesn't work(or is it only when the priest is on the other line? It's never made clear), so maybe they just didn't take it as seriously as those who read the novel(I haven't, nor do I intend to) and everyone else who choose to not think there's a rational reason for what happens in this. Those are the two problems here... this only works if you insist on believing it(if you don't make an effort to convince me, and/or you don't make it effective, I don't enjoy these flicks, as I am not superstitious), meaning that everyone who doesn't won't care much, and that *no one ever does anything in this, no one reacts to anything*. Things happen, minor or otherwise, and they stay, they don't contact someone to fix the things, they don't take a night at a motel to get away from it, and they don't confront what they are faced with in any way. You know, I don't *like* the tendency today in fantasy horror where everything is connected(the ghost(or whatever) comes back in the same place, attacks in a way related to how it died, kills people similar to those that killed it, etc.), but at least those do have structure and are coherent. This just throws a bunch of occurrences at us, nothing in common between them, no hint of an explanation(yes, I've heard that the real building is claimed(and disproven) to be on top of an ancient Indian burial ground... I don't remember hearing that mentioned in this), and even what we do find out about it *is not followed up on*. Maybe you've already heard that George becomes aggressive in this... yes. Until he changes back. And back to angry. You see, this is so busy just doing a bunch of ominous things that it won't bother to build anything up or have any consistency. I don't care how close that is to what is said to have happened... this is a film, and the story-telling is poor in this regard. And before you think that I am complaining and hate anything like this... the following are from the same period and far surpass this: The Exorcist, Poltergeist, The Shining(*that* is where you go for a terrifying husband-turned-psycho!) and Rosemary's Baby. I hear The Omen is great, I haven't watched it. All of those are in a similar vein to this. The acting is good, Brolin and Kidder do well. "Their" kids are OK. The use of sound to intimidate is meh, and this relies on jump-scares that don't pay off(Hollywood's favorite use for cats) or brief odd things that just aren't that memorable(several are silly). There are no consequences and this doesn't leave an impression. At the end of the 110 minutes, you realize that essentially *nothing* happened in this. The FX aren't bad. Much of the time, you can't tell who to sympathize with, who is normal and who is being taken over. There are a few creepy angles, and at least as many awkward ones(who did the framing on this, and were they fired? And then not replaced?). This is the same director as on Cool Hand Luke, and I hear that is a classic. Maybe he was certain this was true? There isn't a lot of tension or suspense(it's too "busy", nothing gets to sink in... with that said, the pacing isn't overly fast). There is some disturbing content, blood and violence in this. The 2-Disc Special Edition comes with a commentary track by Hans Holzer, a doctor with a p.H.d. in parapsychology and an intro to it(he talks trash about religion a little, though otherwise, he just sits there and talks about how it differs from the book(that he doesn't challenge the legitimacy of)), three documentaries(two of them have their own pages here on the site, and I will review them there), including History's Mysteries ? Amityville: Horror or Hoax(it's OK, really inconclusive and they basically just all assert that they're correct, whether they think it's real or not), a 5 and a half minute sneak preview of the 2005 remake, 3 and a half minute of radio spots(7, of around 30 seconds each) and the theatrical trailer. I recommend this only to those who want to see anything like this... quality or otherwise. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this haunted house gives people colds and swipes money from their pockets like a mischievous prankster? Oooh, spooky! I liked Amityville 3 better. At least I felt sorry for some of those characters. And Lori Loughlin was great. Why was the first Amityville a bigger hit? Because of the lie that it was based on a true story. Without that thought to creep you out, this is a pretty incompetent horror movie. I'm not one who craves blood and gore, and I appreciate more subtle, slow-building movies like The Haunting (directed by Robert Wise). But The Amityville Horror is not in that league at all. The characterization is non-existent, and the pacing... my god, the pacing. It's not a good sign when even the edited-for-TV version of this movie feels *way* too long. Was the extra time devoted to making us care about the characters? Nope. I kinda hoped they'd die, particularly the whiny kids. Especially the little girl who seemed more creepy to me than any ghostly presence that may have been haunting the house. The evidence: She calmly leaves her babysitter locked in a closet and is totally immune to her hysterical screams. Oh sure, her ghost pal wouldn't *let* her open the door. But I didn't see her trying to change ghostie's mind, or feeling remorseful afterwards (or even reacting normally with fear/disgust when babysitter comes flying at her with bloody fists). Also, Little Miss Innocent seems smugly satisfied at the thought of her dad being in danger. And *then* the little brat sends him back into the house for the freakin' dog. I'm supposed to believe this demon-child who hasn't cared about anybody else, cares about the dog? Not only that, when they're all escaping at the end, she's got a choke-hold on Margot Kidder's neck, slowing her down, while her brothers slip and slide down the bloody stairs by themselves. So why does the little girl need to be carried, huh? Evil! Oh, almost forgot: right after bugging his sister by dangling a fake spider through a window, who should happen to get his hand smooshed in that window? Coincidence? Ha!Ahem. Anyway, I couldn't root for the parents either. James Brolin's possessed...by the Spirit Of Wooden Acting (An affinity for wood may explain the constant fireplace-gazing and axe-chopping). Margot Kidder takes forever to actually try to *do* something. Like, the obvious things a horror movie character should know to do right away: talk to a priest and do some research about the real-life murder that took place in your house. Duh! She waits 'til the last minute.The best thing I can say about this movie is that the tagline is very appropriate, because you too will find yourself screaming at the stupid characters to just Get Out Of The House already. Much is left unexplained, and I'm pretty sure it's a result of bad filmmaking, as opposed to scenes cut for time in the TV version. Or, y'know, trying to build mystery/create suspense.Why does James Brolin's co-worker's wife/girlfriend suddenly switch from "I can't go in the house...bad feeling! I'll just shiver in the car, okay?" to "Ooh, let *me* lead the Scooby Gang down to the basement, which my psychic sense tells me is the source of all evil. Whee, this is exciting!" Why does the dog keep digging away, with bloody paws, to uncover the Tunnel To Hell, and then as soon as it's uncovered...what? He whimpers and hides? Why'd you wanna get in then, boy? Huh, boy? Come to think of it, I'm not a dog-owner, but I hear they can be indecisive about going outside for a walk/to do their business...pawing at the door and then changing their minds after it's opened. So I guess the dog behaves most realistically of all, and I'm glad he survived.Why does the younger priest not try to help Margot Kidder when she's looking for the older priest who's a friend of hers? I mean, the guy *knows* Rod Steiger wanted to warn Margot's family about the house, and was supernaturally foiled in his attempts to reach them. So, even if he doesn't want to disclose Rod's location, why not pass the message on, since she's so conveniently shown up? Not that she shouldn't be able to figure out that they should move out of the house, without being told by a priest, but still. Why does the cop want to talk to the priest, and then just give up? Why does the cop station himself outside the house and then just disappear? Why the pointless scenes that go nowhere? Why such incompetent filmmaking?!The movie fails to scare, but I fear these questions will haunt me and keep me up at night. Not really.</fullReview>

While I realize an entire book cannot be included in film form without the film being several days long, this would be the art of adaptation, wouldn't it? What bits of the book make it into this movie are so incredibly out of sequence and chopped up and cobbled back together all wrong and for no good reason, we are left with something that is not only not scary, but rarely even makes sense.You wanna good scare, read the book.

		<fullReview>I recently bought THE AMITYVILLE HORROR since I remembered it as being a horror classic. However, after I re-watched it, it wasn't exactly the horror classic I remember it being. It's seemed, well, dated. Unlike some horror movies like THE EXORCIST and HALLOWEEN that seem timeless, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR doesn't quite stand the test of time. It might have been great in 1979, but in 2005 the movie seems cheesy and over-the-top. It's not a bad movie, it's just a so-so movie. That said, there are still some effective scenes and there is a fair amount of suspenseful tension throughout. I'd recommend it to fans of the haunted house genre. Stay away from the 2005 Michael Bay produced remake. Two stars out of four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Amityville Horror for the first time yesterday and I must say that I thought it was horrible. It wasn't even scary like I expected it to be. There were a few creepy moments like the pig with the weird eyes and when the cat jumps on the window when the audience is not expecting it. Besides those two times in the movie, the movie is not scary at all. I don't know why a movie studio even made this horrible movie. If you want to see a good horror flick do not watch this one, you will be very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lutzes and Their Bogus Experience Make for a Dull Horror Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And here we go again. Before THE SHINING, which in book form and in Stanley Kubrick's film version told the story of a haunted house and the doomed family trapped within its ghostly horrors, there was THE AMITYVILLE HORROR. For those who aren't aware of it there is a house in Long Island purported to be haunted. George and Kathy Lutz lived in that house for approximately a month before driven out into the night with what they had on because they were being tormented by its ghosts. Of course, it would have been better had they been truthful to the fact that they couldn't keep up with the payments and needed to bail out so what better way than to concoct a cock-and-bull story of "things that go bump in the night." Anyway, it made for a pretty lousy read and it makes for an even lousier movie that incredibly has given way to a variety of sequels, prequels, and a recent Hollywood remake barely making it now to DVD for the winter of 2005.</fullReview>

The ending of the new remake scared me so much, this one however left me a bit disappointed. Although the voice in the house scared me to death in this one, there not enough of it. And it doesn't even seem to go in depth with him trying to kill him family, its not a horrible movie, and for any horror collector it's a good movie to have, so you can see where it all started out.

		<fullReview>Who knew that Margot Kidder had such a nice rack? Not me. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I can say about this movie. Yes. Really.I can't understand what everyone is going on about when it comes to this flick. Ohhhhhh, it's supposedly based on a true story, so it must be scary. Well, color me unimpressed. I've seen a few documentaries on the subject, and I think the real George Lutz was a huckster and self-promoter. In fact, one of the biggest flaws of this movie is that James Brolin's version of George Lutz pales in comparison to the character of the real guy. Lutz is supposed to be a blissful newly-married and love his new wife's kids, but that part of his character is uneven at best. In one scene he's the loving step dad and in another he looks upset that he read for the part. And don't give me that crap about the house supposedly affecting his behavior: he acts aloof and bored the very first time they're in the house, before they even buy it or move in. His acting is just poison in the well as far as I'm concerned.Perhaps I'm judging it too harshly and need to see it again, but when the only positive that you can think of is that it changed your mind--well actually caused you to think for the very first time--about Margot Kidder's breasts, the movie has some serious problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In our writing and strange events going on at ZolaEnterprises.com we have found that totally true ghost and paranormal events are always so much more spooky than any movie even if it was from an actual event or house that one did happen in as such. To do a movie that is 100 percent true and stick to it would be sure hard we know but, true video and sightings are always so different than any special effects. ZolaEnterprises.Com has seen real sightings of ghostly events since our live ghost board session and I can say that to us and the views it was way more spooky than a movie. Maybe check out our live board session or ghost webcams to see the difference in reality and movies. Now for us reality is spooky and movies that were fun are no longer fun.

What did they have to do with the murders from a year previously? As another person has suggested, James Brolin walks around like he's asleep, and is very unappealing. The rest of the cast is so-so.

		<fullReview>I came into this movie right after watching the remake. And after the remake finished I thought to myself..." Remakes are always worse than the originals so therefore the 70's Amytiville won't be so bad." Boy was I wrong. The first half of the movie scares the viewer with empty rooms and distant noises while the second half is just a jumbled mess. The only thing that kept me watching was the sheer fact that the main guy looked like Christian Bale. The acting was bad, the plot started good ended bad, and the ending to the film is absolutely atrocious(don't know if i spelled that right). If you want my advice stay away from this film as well as the remake, they both suck and are a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In retrospect, the Amityville Horror is not deserving of its notoriety, nor of the influence this film has exerted on the horror film genre. Though this film utterly terrified me as a 10 year old child when I first saw this film, I rented this film recently and was forced to fight off the nods rather than the chills. I could not have suspended my disbelief on wires while watching this film about a man who bought a house he could not afford, had a wife he could not live with, and a family he barely had the patience to tolerate. George Lutz was a man looking to blame someone or something for his own personal problems, and the house proved to be a convenient and timely target.The plot, as it stands, is that the murder of the DeFeo family (a very real tragedy) sparked a confrontation with the devil, an Indian burial ground, and the ghosts of the recently deceased family and 21 days or so after moving in, depending on which of the different accounts given by the Lutzes, they ran screaming from the house in the middle of the night terrified out of their minds. It is an eerie coincidence that the mortgage payment was due; unfortunately, a marginally self-employed George Lutz was just a few pesos short on making the payment.For nostalgias sake, I really, really, wanted the Amityville Horror to be better than what it actually was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghosties, ghoulies and things that go bump in the night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the success of "The Exorcist" and "The Omen", ghosties, ghoulies and things that go bump in the night were very much in vogue in the cinema of the seventies. It was, therefore, perhaps inevitable that when Jay Anson's book "The Amityville Horror" about certain paranormal events which had supposedly occurred on Long Island became a huge bestseller in 1977 it would very quickly serve as the basis for a film.In November 1974 a young man named Ronald DeFeo junior shot and killed his parents and his four siblings at the family home, 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville. The following year a couple named George and Kathy Lutz bought the house and moved into it with Kathy's three children from an earlier marriage. During their brief stay in December 1975 and January 1976 the Lutz family allegedly underwent a series of frightening supernatural experiences which forced them to flee the house in terror. Personally, I have never believed that the Lutzes ever experienced anything supernatural; quite apart from my normal scepticism where claims of the paranormal are concerned, there is also the fact that no subsequent occupiers have ever reported any psychic disturbances. Nevertheless, these alleged events were widely reported and believed in some quarters at the time. They provided Anson with the material for his novel and were dramatised in this film.The film virtually created the formula for the modern haunted house movie, followed in later films such as the "Poltergeist" series and the recent "The Haunting in Connecticut"- ideal all-American family (Mum, Dad, several cute kids plus dog), idyllic-seeming suburban setting, various inexplicable happenings creating a mounting sense of terror, spooky-sounding music (in this case by Lalo Schifrin). Despite poor reviews from many critics, it was a huge box office success and (inevitably, given that the 1980s were the golden age of the long-running film franchise) spawned several sequels.So who were right, the critics who panned the film or the audiences who flocked to see it? As such things go, the film is not a bad one; director Stuart Rosenberg is able to conjure up considerable tension during the latter part of the film and doubtless the whole setup looked fresher in 1979 than it does today when movies of this type have become so formulaic that they are apt to produce a "seen it all before" feeling. This film is certainly better than the recent remake (someone obviously felt that enough interest in the Amityville saga still persisted to justify a remake in 2005) or than "Amityville Horror II: The Possession", which is the only one of the numerous sequels I have seen. Nevertheless, I couldn't help feeling that "The Amityville Horror" represented something of a comedown for Rosenberg, who started his career by making "Cool Hand Luke", one of the finest films of the sixties. Whereas some of the other horror films of the seventies have qualities which still make them worth watching today, such as Gregory Peck's excellent acting performance in "The Omen", "The Amityville Horror", to my mind at least, now looks like a dated period piece, a relic of the seventies horror craze and a record of a now-discredited book. 5/10</fullReview>

Although they self-righteously declare that the movie is based on a true story, the real story couldn't have been like what the movie portrays. The movie is essentially two hours of people shouting scared comments, and it uses special effects where they could have character development. Most people will probably agree that "The Shining" significantly improved on this idea. I wouldn't be surprised if James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger chose not to emphasize this movie when discussing their careers.No, it's not a terrible movie.

		<shortDescription>When not providing laughs, it's The Amityville Snore...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First presented in a best-selling "nonfiction" book, this is the story of a family who buys a house on the coast of Long Island where, previously, a young man killed his parents and four siblings. Shortly after moving in, they experience various upsetting events and phenomena, eventually having to run for their lives. The book was a massive success, marketed as a true story, and the film came on the heels of successful religious thrillers as "The Exorcist" and "The Omen", and it attempted to join their ranks as a first-class horror film. Unfortunately, the level of talent in the writing, editing and acting wasn't even close to that of the other films and the story itself was stuck in the mud, thanks to no one having been killed in the "true story". (It's a little tough to sell the threat of evil when it's a forgone conclusion in the tale that no one was harmed beyond a few scratches and some vomiting.) A fairly vivid opening, in which the murders are depicted, is followed by a rather creepy tour of the home (which includes more graphic scenes of the killings.) Then tedium and ridiculousness set in as the family is tormented by events in the home. Brolin looks fairly deranged even at the beginning when he looks through the gate of the boathouse. His only change, as he descends into a type of possession, is that his hair gets more and more unattractive and he is a bit more pale. Kidder attempts to give a down to earth performance, but is undone by the cruddy script and by an instantaneously preposterous approach to her hair and wardrobe. She, as a divorced mother of three, wears a selection of schoolgirl get-ups and wears her hair in ponytails (not to mention the instance when she, bizarrely, sports ONE leg warmer while doing ballet moves in an unbuttoned top!) The bratty kids are no help either, though at least Ryan is unsettlingly strange. Worst (best?) of all is Steiger who does the impossible. He actually tops his indulgent, hammy role in "Waterloo" by portraying a feverish, troubled priest who runs into significant trouble when attempting to bless the house. Dailey has a small, but equally hammy, role as a nun who also heaves within moments of setting foot inside. Would everything have been fine if the family had been Baptist instead of Catholic?? Stroud (perhaps the least likely candidate to portray a man of the cloth) is unconvincing in his sketchy role. There are a few jolts sprinkled in amongst the dreariness and Schifrin's score (along with the imposing house itself) adds some atmosphere, but too often it's either preposterous or unintentionally funny. By the time blood seeps out of the walls and Brolin is swimming in black gunk, it's already lost what little sense it had. Perhaps devoutly religious people may get more shock out of it all (though the entire enterprise has since been revealed as a total hoax.) Brolin is to be credited, however, with one extended scene in his tightie-whitie briefs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the first two Amityville horrors films. No intention of seeing any more of the sequels. Honestly, I don't see how some films attain their status. I'm under the impression that anything horror-related out of the 70s is good by definition. This along with TCM and Last House really failed to move me. I find it very disappointing since I rent these films with the expectation of seeing something worthwhile, and I found Halloween and Exorcist to be quite the extraordinary experience. Amityville falls into the category of old school disappointments.In a nutshell, the film is a series of unrelated freaky events supposedly based on a true story. How true is the story? That'll be debated for awhile to come by the people with a enough free time to care. Still though, Amityville had potential, and I don't feel it's necessarily a bad film. It's average at best and undeserving of the hype, that's all.Strengths include an intriguingly delicate yet eerie, score provided by Lalo Schiffrin - quite easily the best aspect of the film. This is a dreamlike score that combines childlike innocence with a shadow hiding something. Very well crafted despite most the rest of Amityville not pulling its weight. Other highlights - I liked the `demon eyes' windows, especially lit up at night. That aspect of the house came across as intimidating. Then later in the film when the father sees a red eyed bore inside the house sent a chill down my spine. Beyond that, though, Amityville didn't provide much in the way of narrative, characters, or visual style that really gripped me. I'd comment on the acting, but any regular visitor to the horror section of their video store knows what I'm going to say so what's the point?This film needed a stronger connection between events; it needed a sense of moving somewhere - either take liberties with the truth or drop the `based on a true story' banner. It needed more interesting characters, and it needed more imagery to match the quality of the music. But as is, it's just `okay with a few good points.'</fullReview>

You can't have a suspenseful get-out-of-the-house-it's-haunted flick with a bunch of dullards at the center. The opening moments, showing the early murders in the residence, aren't grisly but they are disturbing--scarier than any of the bleeding walls or red-eyed pigs which come later. That's the thing these movie-makers haven't grasped: that a warped human condition is more terrifying than any of the supernatural nonsense they can cook up. Just as with the "non-fiction" cause celeb bestseller this is based upon, the movie is a scrap-heap of spooky clichés only frightening to the gullible. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Amityville Horror" is a typical haunted house movie with the 'based on a true story' claim branded on it, which may be the largest reason for it's success. The film concerns George and Kathy Lutz (James Brolin and Margot Kidder), both newlyweds who decide to buy a grand Dutch colonial house in Amityville, Long Island, New York. They are aware that a year earlier, the savage slaughter of an entire family took place in the house, but they try to push that aside and make the house their own. After moving in, strange things begin to happen, and George becomes increasingly violent with both Kathy and her children, and the evil entity dwelling within the house begins to consume the family's lives. The terrified family ends up fleeing their house after only spending twenty-eight days there.While the large popularity for this film more than likely rests with it's claim that it was supposedly based on an actual haunting, "The Amityville Horror" is a slightly above-average (but really not by that much) haunted house film. I've heard people claim this film to be one of the horror greats, but in all honesty, I just didn't find this film to be anything quite so mind-blowing. It was decent and just a minimal notch above average, but it was very far from perfection. The story is based on Jay Anson's novel, and while the book itself is fairly well-written (yes, I have read it), this film adaptation is a little choppy. The main idea gets across, but there are many little things that the audience feels the need to pick-up on, only to have them receive no explanation afterwards. The strange happenings in the house turn out to be related to something to do with an Indian burial ground, but that's all we really know, because none of it is ever elaborated on, and things begin to become a little too meandering.It isn't all bad though, it has some redeeming qualities. There is a handful of really spooky and memorable scenes and some nice cinematography to be seen. While the script has some holes, the main story is actually very scary. The 'true story' claim may be real truth or just plain fiction, I'm not really sure what the think about it, but things like this tend to spook me so I found the entire premise to be fairly creepy. The acting in the film is decent overall, but not anything award-worthy. James Brolin's performance becomes a little silly during his morphing stage in the film, and is very clearly overacting in quite a large amount of the movie. Margot Kidder does this as well, shouting her lines quite often, but I liked her performance better. Rod Steiger plays the role of the priest rather well, probably turning in the best performance of the film.Overall, "The Amityville Horror" has it's pluses and minuses, but I can't give it an overly high rating. It's a decent but flawed haunted house film, and it's a "classic" by popularity. If the film wasn't supposedly based on actual events, I don't think that it would have received the hype or status that it did. It's not a horrible film and I'd recommend it to horror fans, but it's not great either. Just a tad above average, but worth seeing at least once. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A family (James Brolin is the dad...Margot Kidder is the mom) move into a beautiful house in Long Island NY. Naturally it turns out to be haunted. This is a (bad) adaptation of a very good book. Supposedly the book was accepted as being true...we all know now that it's totally fictional. The book was a quick, scary read. The movie takes the book, jettisons almost all of the scary material, and ends up being a VERY dull mess. What was the studio thinking? Why take a good book and totally destroy it?The acting doesn't really help. Brolin appears drugged out during the entire movie and Rod Steiger REALLY overacts as a priest. Margot Kidder is very good--she gives this movie a much better performance than it deserves. And it IS kind of fun to see Murray Hamilton and Don Stroud as priests.The film does have a few good moments: there's an opening multiple murder scene which jolts you and a certain dream Kidder has is nice and gory (and not in the book). Also the film looks beautiful--especially the house. This was AIP's (American International Pictures) last film--it was also their biggest hit. THAT'S scarier than anything in this movie. Basically a dull, big-budget horror movie. Let's hope the remake is better. This is a 1 all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this the other day because of its "classic" status. This is the antithesis of "The Exorcist": laughable performances in a half-baked script. The direction is way off, and things happen for inexplicable reasons. We never get a clear answer about situations, which in some films may be considered "intelligent" because it makes you ponder on the ideas, while here it is just plain idiotic. James Brolin makes the stupidest faces I have ever seen on film (and I don't mean in a Jim Carrey sense; just plain stupid) and makes me wonder how he got into acting in the first place. Margot Kidder is very underutilized in the film. Basically, it looks like the director and the cast/crew were all on drugs while making this film. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>much ado about nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just visited the actual house in Amityville, NY, and then I watched the original film. Terrible, but not totally unwatchable, film. Nothing "scary", just a lot of doors and windows bangin' shut, flies, sludge in toilets, the daughter has a (supposedly) imaginary evil friend, and a "red room" is discovered in the basement. Rather dull and much too long at 2+ hours. Of course the actors (James Brolin, Margot Kidder, Rod Steiger) totally emote. The most hilarious scene is of the braces-wearing, pony-tailed babysitter getting locked in a closet. The door slams shut behind her and she can't get out. So what does she do? She doesn't try to push the door open using her full body weight. Instead she pounds and knocks on the door over and over while sobbing. Oh yeah, THAT'S how you open a stuck door! FAKE.The movie was filmed in Toms River, NJ, *not* at the actual house in Amityville, NY. It's so obvious (to me) that the movie house isn't the real thing. The movie house's crescent-shaped windows are HUGE, the crescent-shaped windows face the water (river) in back of the house and not the street (as they did in real life), and the movie house's yard is much larger than the real life house's yard. FAKE.Plus in real life, the Lutz family lived in the house from mid-December 1975 until late January 1976. But in the film there is no snow, there is no Christmas tree in the house, and everyone is outside without coats on. FAKE.I think in real life the married couple concocted the "evilness" with the help of their priest. I wonder how the three individuals came into contact with the book's author and how much the three individuals were paid for their collaboration (conspiracy).I think the REAL story, if there is an actual "real" story, is that the married couple could not handle the psychological burden of knowing that they were living in a house where six murders took place only one year before they moved in. At first they were happy to buy the house at such a good (heavily discounted) price but slowly they came to grips with the eeriness of living in such an infamous place. I want to remake the film and focus the story on how the family (and priest) became more and more unhinged by this psychological burden and NOT by clichéd acts of the devil they supposedly witnessed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Horror Flick That Somehow Became a Hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amityville Horror, The (1979) * 1/2 (out of 4) Newlywed couple George and Kathleen Lutz (James Brolin, Margot Kidder) move themselves and their three kids into their dream house but soon they start to realize that something there isn't quite right. A few years earlier a man killed six people inside the house and it appears that something is possessing George. With the best-selling book behind it, it's easy to see why this AIP-horror flick became a huge hit but when viewing it today it's easy to see why it was considered a bad movie then and time certainly hasn't done it any favors. This is certainly one example where we should be grateful for remakes because the 2005 film was much better even if it stayed away from the original story somewhat. Back to this film, I think a lot of the blame has to go towards director Rosenberg because I found the majority of his "directing" to be quite bad. Whenever you watch a scary movie you expect to be scared but not once does that happen here. There are certainly a lot of "ghostly" moments that occur but none of them are very effective. We have a young child playing with an "imaginary friend" but we know who this friend actually is. We have the father growing more and more deadly. We have a mother trying to protect her children from these "things". We have doors and windows being opened and closed by unseen forces. We have blood coming from walls. We even have a dog digging at something in the basement. There are all sorts of possible moments to make us jump or grow scared but none of them ever happen. I don't know if the filmmaker was forced to rush things to get this in the theater while the story was still hot but he adds nothing. There's not any atmosphere, there's no suspense and there's not even a hint of drama. The special effects that are displayed are all pretty weak but then again a ghost story shouldn't really need those. There's certainly elements of a psychological drama but sadly the majority of the performances can't pull this off. Brolin is pretty dry in the role of the father and when we see him "acting" as if he's going crazy, I must admit that it made me laugh. I never really believed him in this role and especially once the crazed look starts to come over his face. Kidder is pretty good in her part but sadly the screenplay doesn't do her any justice as the part is clearly underwritten. Rod Steiger plays a priest who is "worried" about the house but he doesn't get to do much either. Don Stroud, Val Avery and Murray Hamilton round out the cast. THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, the actual case, will always be debated by people. Some believe the events while others see it as a way for the couple in the house to get rid of it and make money of a fake story. No matter what you believe I think it's clear that the majority will be bored to tears by this sloppy film that has nothing going for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say this is the worst film I have ever seen. Having seen the remake (which I thoroughly enjoyed) I expected the original to be at least watchable. I was wrong. For a start It wasn't scary. The filmmakers attempts at trying to scare the audience fail every time. Worst still the acting is terrible and the two main characters (James Brolin &amp; Margot Kidder) fail to portray the feelings of the Lutz family during their 28 day stay in the house. The best thing you can do is to avoid this so-called "classic" of the genre as the remake is far better. The only positive point I can think of is the unintentionally hilarious priest (Rod Steiger) whose story is a pivotal part of the second half of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the poorest famous horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror is a case of a film whose fame far out-weighs its quality. The reason for this is surely down to the fact that the movie was based on 'real events'. The book of the same name had been published not too long before the release of the film, and it had been a best-seller. The idea that such terrifying supernatural events could have actually happened was a massive selling point for the book and subsequently the film. And as a result both were highly successful. Since then, however, there has been much criticism about the supposed authenticity of the events depicted, with many people of the opinion that the Lutz family had fabricated the whole thing. Personally, I don't believe a word of the story and think that the whole thing is one big giant hoax. Nevertheless, that is no reason whatsoever for the film being so lame and lifeless.The story is basically about a family who move into a house whose previous occupants died in a blood-bath a year previously. Immediately on arrival, the new tenants experience all sorts of extreme paranormal activity.For what must have been quite a big budget production, The Amityville Horror comes across as a low-budget trashy B-movie. It's not well directed at all and never capitalizes on the potential that the scary material presents. There is not even one stand-out moment of tension or inventive horror. Instead the film is just a succession of poorly executed horror movie clichés (the very idea that this schlock could ever have happened in real life is pretty laughable). One of the film's few saving graces is the soundtrack by the ever-reliable Lalo Schifrin; it's eerie and memorable, something that certainly can't be said for the film as a whole.The Amityville Horror is without doubt one of the least essential big horror films from the past. It may have made an impact back in the day but this must surely have been to do with clever marketing, and the frightening idea that it was all true. It most certainly is not due to it's excellence as a horror movie. While not entirely devoid of entertainment value ? it's OK as a B-grade horror cheese-fest ? it should be noted that this is seriously far removed from being good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie was first released in 1979, I saw it in the theaters. It is not a bad little slice of the entertainment cheese, but it was unfortunate that they had to lie to make it hit.On the big screen, and at home (alone hiding under the covers in my bed reading the book late at night), it was an immensely scary venture into the world of the vengeful poltergeist. The main element which made this attempt more frightening than it really was, was the (then accepted) fact that this work centered around true events. It was sold to the world as a "True Story."As it turned out, the only events which were true were the gruesome murders which were perpetrated before the Lutz's had ever heard of the house; and that the Lutz's, the house, and Amityville all exist. The events which happened to the Lutz's described both in the book and the film, were lies. It was proved in court that the writer, "took (generous) liberties," with the truth. Had this movie been released as fiction, it would not have left those of us who were truly frightened by the implications of this work, feeling betrayed and would still have a somewhat decent following today.We were able to overlook the horrid cinematography, the cheesy dialog, the plastic acting, and the obvious bad timing of delivery throughout this movie because we BELIEVED. We forgave it all because we were told it was a true story. It couldn't be the writer's or the director's fault because it wasn't a contrived plot; it was real! Now, we know it's all just a lie, and I (frankly) have no stomach left for it.Now, they're doing a remake. Frankly, I can understand a remake. It is horribly dated, and awful. It NEEDS a remake. But to perpetuate a lie? I think not. There are far more worthy films in the studio vaults than this. Perhaps this newest generation of "young adults" will buy into the lie just like we did but for their sakes, I hope not.This rates a 1.0/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did this show in theaters?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been revisiting some old movies from my childhood to see how they hold up. Horror movies are interesting because so many of the films that were scary back then are not anymore. I rented this film with my girlfriend promising her an old cult horror movie.It turns out I didn't remember the movie at all. I'm not even sure I'd seen it. I think the film just resonated in my memories because people spoke about it and so many sequels were made. If I had remembered it, I would have never rented it again.The film has the look of a low budget made-for-tv-movie. My girlfriend and I were reading the DVD box trying to figure out if this was ever shown in a theater.The film was surprisingly funny. Special effects of 'the horror' seemed to have been made by hanging red lightbulbs out a window. The acting consisted of two emotional states; talking in a normal voice or dramatic yelling. Every character had to yell at some point in the movie, even if it seemed inappropriate. One character would make a loud and convincing point only to beaten down by the overacting (in other words, the other character yelled more)of another. It was very funny.It was never truly scary. I can't say I was entirely bored. I was kept interested the entire time because I kept thinking the next scene would be the one that made this movie famous. Also, we laughed quite a bit. That famous scene never came. Just more laughs.The only positive thing I credit to this film is that it may be the first film to use what have now become cliched haunted house conventions; bleeding walls, muck in the plumbing, etc. In reality, I am only speculating about this. Perhaps this was cliched even then? Yet, it's the only way I can figure that this movie had any popularity and spawned sequels.If you rent it, do so to see a film artifact that has not aged well. Also, rent it with a bunch of friends to laugh. But if you want to rent a horror classic and hope to be scared, rent the Shining or the Exorcist.</fullReview>

Ed Wood movies are even better than this, 'cause at least they're comically bad. This was just.... It's one of those movies where I'm just constantly boggled by how the director could possibly think, "Yeah, that's the take I wanted, right there. Nailed it."

		<shortDescription>Why the hell were there so many sequels?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you hear that The Amityville Horror is a horror classic? You heard wrong. The Amityville Horror actually starts off pretty good, with a fairly well done murder scene at the famous house with eyes. However, this is probably the scene (perfectly placed right at the beginning) that put so many people off, particularly the critics. I think that this is a film meant for a younger audience, because most people with families of their own are likely to be disgusted by the carnage that is presented in the opening moments of this movie. This effectively disturbing murder scene is soon followed by a scene where the prospective tenants (some time later) are given a tour of the house by the real estate lady, which makes for a good and well placed way to show the audience around the increasingly creepy house. On the other hand, this was evidently also taken as another opportunity to offend the more mature audience by editing some grisly scenes from the brutal murders into the tour, although it was a fairly effective technique.(spoilers) Once the family has moved in, the strange events begin almost immediately. When the priest, a friend of the family, comes over, he walks into the house, not knowing that the whole family is outside. As he calls out to see if anyone is home, he hears children laughing upstairs. The audience knows that everyone is outside, and this is probably one of the more chilling moments of the film. Why are the ghosts of children so much more unnerving than those of adults? I can never figure that out exactly, but it gets me every time. This was one of the things that made for the scariest moments in countless other films, such as the more recent Blair Witch Project.Unfortunately, after that scene with the children's voices, the film seems to go precipitously downhill, and the ending is the nearly audible crash landing. There are so many cliched scares that were thrown randomly into this film with no forethought that they nearly ruined the entire movie single-handedly. You have the Waking Up Screaming scare, you have the inexplicable Screeching Cat scare, the slamming doors, the mysteriously locked windows and doors, the bumps in the night, the cold rooms, the empty rocking chair, the constantly sweaty father, the list goes on and on. And the things that were actually original made little to no sense at all. For example, we never get any explanation for why that one room upstairs is occasionally filled with hundreds and hundreds of flies. Are we to assume that the rotting corpses of the murdered family are somehow returning to the house? At one point, the toilets in the house spout some sort of tar-like substance, which is also never explained. In another scene, it seems that the house steals $1500 from the oldest son, which he had planned to use to pay the caterer at his wedding (that better have been a damn good caterer). Was this a crime of profit? Committed by the evil house?! Then we have the one scene where the house viciously yells at the priest to "Get Out!" This wouldn't have been so ineffective had it not been such a completely isolated event. And what exactly was that thing that George, the sweaty father, saw in the upstairs window near the end of the film, some kind of gigantic ghost-pig with glowing eyes? Was that thing supposed to have been superimposed into a different film, and got into The Amityville Horror by accident?I admit that most of this stuff can just fit into the category of the house itself, which is clearly alive in some way, trying everything possible to scare the people away. But on the other hand, why does it want some people gone and others to stay? It tells the priest to get out, but then burns his hand and cuts the connection when he tries to call and warn the family about what happened while he was there. Maybe it wanted George there, because he looks exactly like the guy who killed his family in the house in the opening of the film. Or maybe that similar resemblance is just the first of many ideas that were taken directly from The Shining. The Amityville Horror is strikingly similar in many ways (including the vast majority of the storyline) to The Shining, which leads me to suspect some sort of plagiarism. Kind of makes you wonder... And not only that, but most if not all of the sound effects during scary scenes seem to have been taken directly from the Psycho soundtrack.The impression that The Amityville Horror gives is that of a movie that presents a good story that appears to have been taken from someone else and badly presented in a slightly altered form. Some scenes were unnecessary at best, if not completely exploitative. Did we really need to see the nun loudly vomiting in the middle of the road? George is made to look like some sort of mountain man with no time to respect helmet laws, the guy looks like a freakin' grizzly bear. Who cares that he nearly axed his wife to death in a fit of temporary insanity, he went back and heroically saved the dog at the end, so he's a good guy again, right? That's crap. And how about that ending? Was the script-writer hit by a truck? They may as well have just said "They got away." I'll admit that The Amityville Horror is not an utter failure. There were a few scenes (emphasis on "few") that actually delivered chills, but unless you are absolutely determined to see this movie, you may be best advised to watch The Shining instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember how this movie terrified you when you were 10? And remember how you're not 10 anymore? First, a few of the steaming elements in this potent brew: The movie begins with flashbacks of the previous occupants being shot in their beds. Then, a few minutes later, as James and Margot are looking through the rooms, we get the same quick flashbacks again, in case you're just too stupid to realize that these are the very same rooms where the murders took place.Yikes! What about those hideously tacky mirrors in the master bedroom! Is that the horror the title is talking about? The film's lamentable gesture toward "sensuality" is horribly wrong-footed. First we have Margot Kidder with a daisy in her hair (okay fine, it's the 70s) practicing her ballet moves in front of the aforementioned hideous bedroom mirrors in her panties and thigh-high white stockings. Then James Brolin, looking like the lost Brother Gibb, comes in and they make "sensuous" out-of-focus love as reflected in the hideous mirrors. It doesn't look like it's very fun, and the stupid daisy stays in Margot's hair the whole time.This film features not one, but two clean vomitings! Where someone pukes behind a car door, and amazingly their face is lickably clean just after! You just don't see too many performances in orthodontic headgear anymore.Huh, they sure do have a comprehensive concert lighting system deployed in that attic room! Hey, and did anyone else notice that the lights on in that attic room kind of look like eyes? Kind of like the house is, you know, watching you? That's one of the subtle and underplayed touches that set this film apart from the rest.This evil house steals petty cash! Murray Hamilton may have to worry about getting typecast as the patronizing guy who tells you to stop all that nonsense about sharks/ghosts so as not to disrupt the tourists/clergy. Or maybe that's just in movies that take place in a town with "Amity" in the name.Rod Steiger sets the monologue intensity bar at the top, then sails over it again and again! The wicked house makes crank phone calls! There's a weird thing I noticed where, in the scene where Brolin is going nuts and swings the axe at Kidder (on the floor), they are both shown in old-age makeup. It only lasts for a second, and when the attack is over, it's gone. Surely just another masterstroke of the director. That fails.The main problem with the movie is that its "and then, and then, and then" structure makes it feel like absolutely nothing is happening, even though it sometimes is. I think it was a mistake to structure the movie around the days in the house (Day 1, Day 2, etc.) because it adds to the feeling of tedium, it inspires feelings of "It's only day 7, Jeez, how long is this going to last?," and finally, it makes it seem like SO MUCH is happening in the house that these people are plumb nuts not to leave. It also results in a bad effect from the sudden jump, about two-thirds of the way through, to "the last night," with a corresponding leap in the intensity of the ghostly goings-on. It leaves an impression that the days in between were just too boring, or they were too similar to the first days, or that the filmmakers recognize that the audience would just be getting bored. The remake has the sense to limit itself to the beginning, the middle, and the end.One thing that I think is just flat-out careless film-making is that the panes of the upper "eye-like" windows are shown intact, many times, after those windows have CLEARLY been blown out.You do know that this story was proved to be a hoax years ago, don't you? You can do a quick search and find info on that, I don't have the interest to look it up for you. But when you think of it like that, jeez folks, cut back on the sheer amount and variety of phenomena a little bit, this is getting ridiculous.So, as for this story they invented, and how it was presented in the movie, I think a curious subtext emerges. The Brolin character, James Lutz, is presented as having converted from Judiasm to Catholicism to marry Margot, and the movie develops a lot of tension from his adjusting to his life with her and her kids. The house is on Long Island, traditionally a very WASP-y community. I'm not sure it's intended, but the actions of the house can be interpreted as a repulsive reaction to a Jew, and worse than that, a Jew who forswore his religion, attempting to enter the community. I'm sure Brolin's dunk into the blood at the end has something to do with this, but I'm so down on my religious texts I can't spell it out.The only other thing I should mention is that the director also did Cool Hand Luke.Hey, there's lots more reviews of bad and cheesy movies on my website, Cinema de Merde, which you can find by using the URL in my email address.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Amityville Horror" has all the ingredients for a good movie of its type - solid actors, a respected director, a creepy story - but somehow, it utterly fails to gel. Individual scenes simply die on their feet, and never successfully work together to build suspense. It's...dull! The main problem is that our protagonists, competently played by Margot Kidder and James Brolin, are underdeveloped characters. We see them in stereotypical "happy" mode for only a few scenes before the haunted house aspects take over and overshadow all else. One especially thin plot strand suggests that Kidder and a local priest (overplayed by the usually great Rod Steiger) are good friends; this claim is somewhat undermined by the reality that they're never seen on screen together. In fact, Steiger seems to inhabit his own little side movie, complete with long, pointless arguments about theology with Murray Hamilton, who was at this point clearly typecast as an obstructive twit (see also "Jaws").This sad little package is rounded out by some of the very worst special effects I've seen in a movie - the "phantom pig" proving the most risible of all. It's too bad, really, as I'm usually a fan of intelligent, slow-paced horror. This movie's got the slow pacing down, but is somewhat lacking in the brains department. I wonder if the remake is better...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lutz family have just bought a new house. Its huge and has everything they need. Though the house is marked with a gruesome murder; where a son killed his parents and brothers and sister with a shotgun. Thinking that its stuck in history they will be fine and move into the house. Not soon after George starts to act strange. He is always feeling cold and every day looking paler and distraught. When Father Delaney comes to bless the house, we find there is a malevolent force in the house. The young girl can also talk to the dead girl Jody who was killed in the house. Over the days the amount of coincidences start to mound up and Kathy realise there is a spiritual force at work.Amityville Horror while might have horror status, it has so much of its potency that it doesn't resonate that horror feel. Watching it now it is very mediocre and has become a gimmick almost. The acting is so over played that there is no impact from it. The sales woman and Father Delaney are comical; i found myself laughing at them they were so over done. James Brolin just doesn't seem scary, he doesn't have that disturbing madman feel, instead he just look eccentric. Margot Kidder screaming fits get annoying real fast and she doesn't evoke much sympathy for her characters dilemma.The pacing of the film is so slow too. While most good horror films do take time to build up to its climax, its to over drawn and the ending is a let down. One thing that was out of place is the demonic pig. It just appears in the end and your not given a meaning as to what its meant to represent. Its also repetitive seeing people showing up and then running away from feeling the malevolent force.The Amityville Horror is not what it use to be and has lost its impact, but it did set the mark for all the haunted house movies to follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror starts as George (James Brolin) &amp; Cathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) decide to by a large house in Amityville on Long Island upstate New York, the fact that it was the place where multiple murders were committed is seen as unimportant. They move in along with Cathy's three young children but there's something evil in the house, something which wants to destroy the lives of the Lutz family &amp; anyone who tries to stop it. The Lutz family quickly discover the house has a terrible past that has come back to literally haunt them...Directed by Stuart Rosenberg I think The Amityville Horror was average at best despite it's classic status amongst some. The script by Sandor Stern was based on the best selling novel 'The Amityville Horror: A True Story' by Jay Anson which was a telling of the true events which supposedly happened to the real George &amp; Cathy Lutz although it has since been proved to have been a hoax. Anyway, this is a pretty straight forward haunted house horror &amp; a dull one at that with a script that has various ideas but doesn't know what to do with them. For instance there's a police inspector who becomes involved towards the end for no particular reason &amp; is then totally forgotten making his scenes pointless, then there's Father Delaney who pops up every so often in another character who seems like he's there to pad the film out &amp; not actually do anything. Then there's the plot or lack of it, the murders during the opening sequence are never explained, why the house is haunted is never explained, what that red room to hell thing is never explained &amp; the significance why Goerge looks exactly the same as the guy who committed the previous murders is never explained or expanded upon other than another cheap throw away 'isn't this spooky' moment. At almost two hours it goes on for far too long &amp; provides all the haunted house genre clichés you expect like doors opening closing by themselves &amp; blood pouring from cracks in the floor. Overall a disappointment.Director Rosenberg directs like a made-for-TV film &amp; it looks rather bland &amp; forgettable, there certainly isn't any style or visual flair to it. There may be one or two bit which might creep a few people out but for the most part this is pretty tame, tensionless stuff without any atmosphere. There's no gore apart from a dream sequence when George puts an axe into Cathy's head.Technically the film is fine but rather flat &amp; uninteresting, it's well made but nothing stands out as being spectacular. The acting is alright but Brolin as George is just so unlikeable it's hard not to root for the ghosts &amp; Rod Steiger as Father Delaney in a terrible performance overacts horribly.The Amityville Horror is a fair haunted house horror film that tells it's story reasonably enough but never really grabs you, definitely not the classic many make out. Followed by seven sequels, Amityville II: The Possession (1982), Amityville 3-D (1983), the made-for-TV Amityville: The Evil Escapes (1989) &amp; then the straight-to-video The Amityville Curse (1990), Amityville 1992: It's About Time (1992), Amyityville: A New Generation (1993) &amp; finally for the time being Amityville: Dollhouse (1996) although it was remade by Hollywood itself as The Amityville Horror (2005).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very lacking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Amityville Horror is often regarded as something of a minor classic within the horror genre; but this is an unfounded viewpoint, as this film is largely rubbish. The first hour and a half at least are boring, and when it finally does begin to get exciting; you're already too bored to care. The plot follows a family consisting of a mother, a stepfather and a couple of kids. They move into a house where someone killed their family (good opening gets your hopes up) in a small town called Amityville. However, all does not go well and soon after moving in, the family starts to experience a couple (and I mean 'a couple') of slightly odd happenings. This then gets them thinking that the ghost of the man that killed his family is in the house somehow and we've got a horror film on our hands. Or at least we should have...In a film that focuses on having the horror moving at a slow pace, you've got to expect a lot of it's running time to focus on building it's characters. However; the 'down time' here does no such thing. Instead, it concentrates on (trying to) make itself frightening with one ridiculous and boring scene after another. The kid locks the babysitter in the closet, some flies attack a priest, James Brolin (the actor who plays the central character) looks "malevolent" etc etc, and it gets boring fast. The Amityville Horror is the next horror film up for a remake, and for once this may be a good thing as this film completely fails to capitalise on it's premise. Of course, ghost stories often make for rubbish films; but this one fails to even be a good ghost story. To it's credit; the house does look foreboding and the film builds the atmosphere surrounding it up well, but there's not much else in the way of good things that can be said for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Amityville" a classic?? Didn't think so?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some incomprehensible reason, "The Amityville Horror" enjoys the modest status of being a classic horror film and, moreover, some big shots in Hollywood even considered it profitable enough to remake it in 2005. Well, maybe I just don't know anything about good horror, but this just a very average movie with a limited amount of thrills and truly antipathetic characters, if you ask me. Supposedly based on the factual events as described in Jay Anson's novel, the story handles about a relatively young family that moves into a giant Long Island mansion with a doubtful past. The previous owners ? a family of six ? were brutally slaughtered by a maniac, who happens to look a lot like the new occupant, George Lutz. The house has a will of its own and it soon starts with terrorizing the entire family and everybody else who sets foot inside, like a bunch of religious people and colleagues of George. "The Amityville Horror" is nowhere near original, since it borrows nearly all its good elements (including every cliché) from earlier successes such as "The Exorcist", "the Omen" and "The Haunting". The screenplay also contains too many dead-ends and underdeveloped ideas and the weak acting ? although coming from a respectable cast ? undercuts the little tension that's left. There're some atmospheric sequences (the bleeding walls!) but generally speaking this is an unspectacular thriller that won't haunt you in your dreams. The score is really good and the house itself makes a wonderful horror location, yet this is not nearly enough to label this film a horror classic. And?whatever you do, avoid the dreadful sequels?All of them!</fullReview>
