		<shortDescription>The mystery of it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No computer generated images, small 1:33 ratio black and white screen and yet there is nothing in the world that comes close to the intimacy of this experience. Just look at Gary Cooper listening, trying to understand. Look at Jean Arthur falling in love. We have lost something very important along the way and it's not just innocence. How is it possible that nobody can get anywhere near this simple magic trick? They used to call Capra films "Capracorn" I wonder what they call Adam Sandler, Freddy Prinze Jr, and Jennifer Love Hewit comedies today? I want to jump into a time machine and go to those days, the days of Mr Deeds, Gary Cooper, Jean Arthur and Frank Capra.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all Capra's films this is the one I like the best, partly, I think, because there has never been anybody in the history of cinema to match Gary Cooper at putting on the boyish charm. As Longfellow Deeds, a man who inherits a lot of money he does not need and therefore does not want, Cooper is just right, a hick, but not a fool, a gentle man but not one who will let the wool be pulled over his eyes. The films' pertinence arises from its' depiction of a rich man prepared to give his wealth away to benefit his fellow man. It was a fantasy then, and is as much a fantasy now, because we do not learn, least of all from pictures even as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tuba player inherits fortune and becomes a Cinderella Man and gets pixiliated in Manhattan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Frank Capra's strengths as a film director was the great team he assembled. Not only did he have a great technical group behind him, but his casts combined talent that went from the major stars to the bit players.In this fable, Mr. Capra gives an answer to those of us that always pondered: what would one do if one inherited a lot of money, or if one won the lottery (fat chance!) It must be terrifying to suddenly have a lot of wealth, in this case 20 million during the worst days of the Great Depression. Sometimes it's better to stay poor rather than have to deal with strangers that have designs on one's newly found wealth!Gary Cooper has never been as charming as the tuba playing, country bumpkin whose life is changed dramatically when he has to go to Manhattan to claim his inheritance. His Longfellow Deeds gets to see first hand how the high society, his uncle belonged to, deals with this unsophisticated greeting card writing poet. Jean Arthur was a natural comedienne. She is wonderful in this movie as the reporter who tricks Deeds into speaking with her and in the process falls in love with the man, the object of the ridicule she writes about.Leonard Standing, one of the best character actors of the era, is equally effective as Cobb, the man who knows a thing or two about those society folks. George Bancroft was also good as MacWade.The film has a pace that never lets the viewer down. In comparison with what passes today as film comedy, this is a masterpiece. It shows the genius of Frank Capra in charge of this group of people that make us treasure films like this one even if it's pure nonsense, which after all, was what the director was looking for to make us laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or is it my favorite?!Just a wholesome, thought-provoking expose on the weirdness of typical American city thinking and behavior, being brought to light by a na?ve young man who has down-to-earth small-town common sense!From the IMDB age-bracket reviews, it seems this movie might not appeal to the younger, especially girls under 18 (go figure).A great Frank Capra-directed film. I also really like "You can't take it with you", but that film is more off-beat and goofy.Enjoy this film when you're in the mood for something to remind you of "goodness". Whatever that is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra knew that Gary Cooper was made for the part of Longfellow Deeds, he waited until Harry Cohn could get him from Paramount before making this film. It certainly is a once in a lifetime role and it got Gary Cooper his first nomination for Best Actor. He lost that year to Paul Muni for The Story of Louis Pasteur. But Capra won for Best Director that year.Cooper, poet laureate of Mandrake Falls, inherits 20 million dollars from a rich uncle. He's not terribly impressed with that as he feels he's living just fine in Mandrake Falls. But he goes down to New York City to settle the estate and gets put up in grand style at his late uncle's mansion. The executor of the estate, Douglass Dumbrille, is one smooth talking, white shoe bottom feeder. This is probably Dumbrille's best known classic villain, John Cedar. He wants Cooper's power of attorney real bad to cover up some dipping he's done. Cooper isn't giving it to him right away though.In the meantime his inheritance has become news and local editor George Bancroft has dispatched sob sister reporter Jean Arthur to invade his inner sanctum. That's a common thread in the Capra populist trilogy, a woman sent to invade the inner sanctum of the hero and ends up falling for him. Jean Arthur did it again to James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Cooper had it done to him again by Barbara Stanwyck in Meet John Doe.After a whole lot of silly incidents which Arthur duly reports on, Cooper gets a real wake up call from one of what the current president then called a forgotten man. John Wray, a desperate farmer, tossed off his land and there were plenty of those in the twenties and thirties tells him off good and proper in a very powerful scene. Cooper, his own values questioned, decides to set up a fund to save the family farm as an institution. Then he's called insane and Dumbrille takes as clients other heirs who want to contest the will. Which leads to Cooper's hearing in court to determine his sanity.The values of Mr. Deeds are certainly eternal, honesty and decency don't and should never go out of style. Unfortunately the family farm is a thing of the past, there are less and less of them every year. It's agribusiness now so a faithful remake could never work today.Yet the original still has a charm that cannot be denied, due to Frank Capra's vision and the way he got great performances out of the whole cast. One performance that shocked me was Raymond Walburn who usually plays avuncular, loquacious types. He plays the butler to Cooper's uncle and now to Cooper himself. To those who expect the usual Walburn we know and love, this is one different Walburn.Even though Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is rooted firmly in the Thirties it should still be seen and studied today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pure Heart and Strong Morals Are the True Keys to Happiness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra (Oscar-winning for directing) created one of the earlier Hollywood masterpieces with "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town". The film follows a good-hearted small-town Vermont man (Oscar-nominee Gary Cooper) who inherits a fortune from a relative he never knew. Now he must go to New York and take over his late uncle's estate, but he must also contend with a whole host of opportunistic bigwigs who want to take advantage of Cooper's kindness. Cooper is not as slow-witted as he appears though as he seems to outsmart all those around him. When reporter Jean Arthur comes along, Cooper falls hard for her and lets his guard down and forgetting himself, he may lose a part of himself that is priceless. Frank Capra dominated the 1930s and 1940s with life-affirming productions that were just simple human stories that would always strike emotional nerves for the audience. "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" is no exception. The remake should cause many to check this one out. This one stands up much higher than Adam Sandler's under-achiever. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unvrivalled in the history of cinema and having just watched it again for the umpteenth time, I thought a short review on IMDb was necessary. I have watched the film regularly for the last twenty years and never tire of its humour, its tenderness, its wit, its romance, its general actors' performance and the originality of its subject matter. Never have tears and laughs been so much intermingled in the same film..I was gushing tears in the scene where Deeds hands a poem which Babe reads in the fog on her doorstep ... a few minutes later Deeds goes running off home, tripping up over a dustbin in the process and I was howling with laughter ... likewise the long passage in the courtroom when Deeds finally decides to "speak up" has me in fits of laughter over its finesse and wit. The final scene, where Deeds comes back to the almost empty courtroom to "collect" Babe who had been sitting by herself there once again started off my waterworks as he picks her up and tenderly embraces her all over the place. Indeed that final "kiss" is one of the photos featured on France's 3rd TV channel's "Cinéma-Club" on most Sunday nights.They are truly indeed a BEAUTIFUL couple in all senses of the world. I will not go through the story of the film again as this has been more than amply related by others but suffice it to say I have never seen any other film made with quite this calibre and actors' performance. Ineed this is the type of film that could only be made once ! Each character is extremely well developed and each actor/actress has exactly the physique of the character they play - an absolutely perfect match, one of those "one-off" films where everything combines to make for the spectator's perfect pleasure.What a shame that in the twenty first century we cannot produce films of this calibre using story line, actors' performance and plot alone - to obtain thrills from present-day audiences, large quantities of excessive noise, flashing lights and especially computer-generated imagery are necessary .... all this at the expense of plot and of the humour and witty lines. But, with modern technology being a double-edged knife, we should nevertheless thank God for it's enabling us to henceforth be able to appreciate these "golden oldies" for years to come !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For he's a jolly good Longfellow---10/10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think of 'Mr. Deeds Goes To Town' as the happier, shinier side of a 'Gary Cooper coin' that features 'Meet John Doe' as the cynical, grubby under side. Both movies feature women who use newspaper stories to distort or manipulate the two leading males, both played by Cooper. In each movie, the two women (Barbara Stanwyck in 'Doe' and Jean Arthur in 'Deeds') end up falling in love with Cooper, as the women start believing in their creation, or in the case of 'Deeds', finally seeing Deeds as he really is. Furthermore, both movies turn an everyday man into a hero of the people. It would seem that Cooper was the perfect fit for whatever vehicle Frank Capra had in mind, so long as it was about a 'hero of the people'.But as far as 'Mr. Deeds' is concerned, there's so much to like about this film that it hardly matters at all to point out any minor detraction of the film. Capra works his usual magic from a well-assembled cast that includes Jean Arthur as Louis 'Babe' Bennett, and in one of his best roles to date, Lionel Standard as Cornelius Cobb. Fans of Standard may see a similarity between the character of 'Cornelius Cobb' and that of the 'Bodyguard' he played in Harold Lloyd's, 'The Milky Way'. Lloyd's film came out only two month's prior to the release of 'Mr. Deeds'. With Capra's magic touch we are able to see a wonderful transformation take place inside the courtroom. Stacked with the odds against him, Deeds outwits his detractors by simply pointing out the idiosyncrasies of everyone in the courtroom involved in his virtual lynching. His simple homespun logic and mannerly approach to the proceedings works like Kryptonite over the jaded and corrupt super city slickers looking for the soft spot on his neck.Although it is true that Capra has a 'magic touch' for appealing to the film going masses of yesterday, as well as today, his deftness in the art of emotional manipulation is a chief by product of that 'magic touch'. How can you not feel good about the character Longfellow Deeds when he's leaving his hometown while the local concert band is playing the song, "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow"? To add more emotional punch to the send off, Capra has Deeds playing tuba to his own going away party. Deeds also plays, "Auld Lang Syne" at his hometown farewell. It would appear that Capra enjoyed using this tune, as he also did so in 'It's A Wonderful Life' ten years later.Watch the scene where Deeds gets the hired help to yell and whoop it up inside his mansion just so they can all hear and enjoy the sound of their own voices echoing from wall to wall. It is a fantastic scene, but just one of many in this movie where you can feel layers upon layers of cynicism melting away from your soul. 10/10. Clark Richards</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank you Library of Congress for restoring this wonderful film. Initially, I expected this Frank Capra flick to overwhelm me with sentimentality and false, overly contrived setups. Well, yes and yes with two huge buts: Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur. The acting is so good, so right in tone, humor, pace -- it makes everything believable (even the silly court scene at the end). It's a feel-good movie that still has a bitter-sweet message. Jean Arthur's acting is beyond anything I've recently seen -- every emotion is perfectly telegraphed with just the right intonation. Gary Cooper (who was nominated for best actor) sprinkles his complex role with the necessary amount of macho pixie dust. Highly recommended. Can't wait to see Mr. Smith goes to Washington.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gary Cooper plays the title character here perfectly, even though the character lacks credibility in terms of how he is so astute about some things and yet so na?ve about others. Jean Arthur also has an interesting character - one for whom we are not sure when and when not she is pretending. The romance between these two characters is simple formulaic and predictable, but the messages that the film has help to pull it through. It is a slight satire on the media, the justice system, and generally the way in which we function as individual human beings. The film also ends on a high note, with many laughs towards the end of the courtroom sequences. It is a bit fanciful, and arguably Stander is added in just for laughs, plus there are a few other minor imperfections. However 'minor' is the key word here: it is overall enjoyable and well made stuff either way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, a far superior work compared to that other Capra populist film `Mr. Smith Goes To Washington' (even Jean Arthur seems fresher her in a role that is a virtual remake of the aforementioned film). We like the story because we can identify with parvenus such as Mr. Deeds and this pulls us through all the way to the predictable, yet delightful and satisfying conclusion that takes place in that good ol' American institution, the courtroom. Just what the doctor ordered to battle a case of cynicism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confirmed My Love For Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes we all just need to be reminded of the important things in life. Sometimes we need to be happy. Sometimes we need inspiration.As a film-maker, Frank Capra understood those elements brilliantly. His films are often dismissed as 'Capra-corn', and that they are not. Yes, they contain a good dose of sentimentality and what has been termed as 'corn' (Capra's favorite tune 'Auld Lang Syne' gets it's first run-out here, along with a slice of 'For He's A Jolly Good Fellow'), yet they are films with a real message, and real characters. Capra celebrates the common man and the spirit of man like no other.Here we have Gary Cooper as Longfellow Deeds, a small-town hick idealist who inherits $20 million. He is brought to the the city of New York, and of course the leeches start to grab on immediately. This good-natured, harmless man is then taken for a ride by the town- most notably by top journalist 'Babe' Bennet (the wonderful Jean Arthur)- who eat up his boyish innocence with mirth. Yet, 'Babe' softens and realizes the good in this man, and the true qualities he possesses- in doing so, she falls in love with him. But the vultures are already pecking on Deeds as he is absurdly committed to an insane asylum for planning to give away his fortune to the poor- the essential practice of 'noblesse oblige'.My favorite Capra film behind 'It's A Wonderful Life', 'Mr Deeds' argues against big-city cynicism and the emphasis on capital gain. It also celebrates the individual, and those that possess the quality of 'goodness'. Longfellow Deeds, naive as he is, has this trait, and he is one of cinema's most heroic and enduring characters. Cooper is excellent in the role, and gives a subtle and measured performance. Deeds' courtroom speech would have been a lesser actor's excuse to put on the theatrics, yet Cooper captures and maintain's his character's quiet integrity throughout.Arthur, one of my favorite actresses, is also excellent as the cynic reporter. Arhur's best asset, her unique voice, delivers many sassy lines and serves her brilliantly. She's comedic, dramatic, light-hearted and emotional in the role- truly a multi-faceted performance. And is she beautiful!...this woman was 36 when this film was made, and she looks gorgeous. Timeless. The chemistry and playing between her and Cooper is wonderful- watching them fall in love is one of the infinite joys of classic cinema.Capra's range of interesting supporting characters are used to the hilt here, and he has the benefit of a sharp script. Never one for visual style, Capra based his success on characters and story-telling. Yet his films did develop a unique structure and look, exemplified in his trademark use of 'Auld Lang Syne' and newsreels that jump to the screen to convey the narrative. He also did an excellent close-up.This film is truly one of the greats. It will bring tears to your eyes, make you laugh, love.It will inspire you, make you realize the important things in life. It will make you realize the importance of caring for others, and the power a lone individual can have if he/she stands up for their beliefs. Yes, Capra simplifies his message and makes it all look so easy, but even if we can take one tiny piece of 'good' away from this film and place it in our everyday lives we will reach someone.Idealistic, moralistic film-making, yes. Crap? No.An absolute classic.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Sousaphone, not a Tuba!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, that was a minor complaint, but an excellent come-on.I did not realize until after I saw this film how many movies similar to this that Frank Capra directed: You Can't Take It With You, Mr Deeds Goes to Town, Meet John Doe, Mr Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life... pure formula. Some are better than others. It's difficult not to get sentimental over It's a Wonderful Life, for me, largely because of the romance between Stewart and Donna Reed. The quirkiness of the characters in You Can't Take it With You are much more endearing than the others. The common thread of the Everyman taking on the Powers That Be is a draw for just about anyone. Nevertheless, I think this particular movie does not deserve it's lofty ranking compared to Capra's other works. It Happened One Night is a far superior story, eschewing all the hypersentimentalization of many Depression-era films. Mr Deeds goes out of it's way to romanticize "small-town virtues" and quirkiness to ridiculous extremes. This, and the squeaky-clean script (which people forget was enforced by self-appointed moral police) is why many people look to films like this as a standard of entertainment. However, many parts of the film are utterly flawed. The courtroom scene is a ridiculous mess, with witnesses and spectators jumping up to make frenzied speeches that would never have been permitted in a real court. The protagonist (Cooper) who spends most the film outwitting opponents, breaks down and punches his opponent at a trial to establish his own mental competence -- and gets away with it! Pure fantasy. I'm sure it played well with people who felt trodden upon by big business in the Great Depression (and I would have been sympathetic), but this doesn't excuse the ludicrous story. Lionel Standler has the best role as Deeds' 'handler' Cornelius Cobb, displaying a nice combination of empathy and protectiveness, and comes off as the only sympathetic (if hard-boiled) character in the film. Jean Arthur does well as the reporter who traps Deeds and ultimately regrets the sleazy act, but the role falls apart in hysterics during the competency hearing. Cooper somehow comes off as both a sharpie and an over-trusting naif, which is quite a stretch. It's hard to tell whether his performance is authentic or wooden. Unfortunately, this is one of those films that had fine sentiments, but cemented the myth of what the "real America" was supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The flaws are covered by the warming effect and the sheer charm of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a famous millionaire dies the media is aflame with the identity of his missing heir. The lawyers are just as interested and track him down to none other than small-town, simple-living Longfellow Deeds. He is more bemused than anything else about his sudden wealth and goes to New York to find out more. Once there he finds no end of people offering him services or selling him things and he tries to find some humanity within the city and the sharks around him. He believes he has found it with women-in-distress Mary Dawson but little does he know that she is really "Babe" Bennett ? the sharpest reporter on the streets.Unfair to watch this film with wholly modern eyes as some have done ? berating it for its celebration of small-town values and perhaps depicting a naivety that is beyond the pale. Likewise though, I don't think that we should embrace it unquestioningly as many do. At its heart it is a Frank Capra film and it presents us with everything that we have come to expect from a film with that description. A simple man (many would say a "good" man) is confronted and to an extent crushed by examples of modern society that fly contrary to his moral and solid existence. That's it. It doesn't really matter what the specifics happen to be here as this is all you really need to know. To some extent of course this is all a bit obvious and na?ve and indeed to some viewer it will be hard to get past that but in its favour it does manage to presence this homely cliché with an enormous wedge of charm.This charm is evident throughout the film but one of the best examples of it is in the courtroom scene that manages to just about avoid being preachy due to the sheer cheering quality it has to it. Capra's direction and Riskin's script bring this out really well although I would question the tagline "rocking America with laughter" ? it was amusing and warming but not hilarious by any means. I'm not entirely sold on Cooper in the lead and certainly not as enamoured as some are here. For my money he plays the "aw shucks ma'am" stuff just a bit too heavily, forgetting to give me a character to go along with it. Jean Arthur is better as she has more to play with, while Bancroft is fun in a bit of a cliché but a fun one. The rest of the cast do what you would expect whether they be simple men inspired, crooked men confronted or serving men treated with respect ? all good but nothing earth shattering.Overall then this is an obvious film that does just what you expect it to and watching it purely with modern eyes will kill it for many viewers. It is best watched with a mind to the period even if not total forgiveness ? because it is not without flaws. The charm and the warming effect it has makes it though and, while not the Capra I would point the newcomer to, it is certainly an example of what we mean when we now say something is Capra-esquire (which is quite something ? to have your name used as a descriptive word so many years later!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, Worthwhile Offbeat Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The combination of story, cast, and director make this an entertaining offbeat comedy, and one that also has a few worthwhile things to say. Gary Cooper does well in a somewhat atypical role for him, Jean Arthur does well in the kind of role that she often played very well, and Frank Capra applies his usual touch to hold it all together.The story has a light but interesting premise, with Cooper as the naive Mr. Deeds who is confronted with the consequences of sudden wealth. He and Arthur work surprisingly well in their scenes together, and they make both the premise and their relationship tangle-ups believable.It's probably not as easy as it looks to make this kind of material work, as the rather ill-conceived 2002 remake demonstrated. The remake actually started better than expected, and for quite a while Adam Sandler was surprisingly bearable in the lead role. But eventually it lost its balance, inserting too much extraneous material that either did not work or that did not fit in with the tone and themes of the rest of the movie.Capra, on the other hand, keeps a good balance between the light, gentle tone and the sometimes far-fetched plot developments. He winds it up in good fashion with a funny courtroom scene that also provides a couple of good, if uncomplicated, observations on human nature.Capra and the stars all made other movies that worked even better than this one does, but "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" itself still remains one of the better movies of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Deeds Goes To Town is a true classic. It is not as famous as other Capra films like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington or It's a Wonderful Life, but it is more entertaining than either of those. Gary Cooper's best role was in High Noon, but Mr. Deeds is probably his most enjoyable role. This is a movie I can watch repeatedly and not get tired of. Cooper and Jean Arthur are wonderful together in this film. It ranks with Meet John Doe &amp; You Can't Take it With You as my favorite Capra filmns. It follows a favorite theme of Capra's: a simple man is exploited by rich, corrupt people. In this case, they are trying to take away the inheritance Longfellow has recieved from a distant relative.There is nothing bad I can say about this movie. It's hilarious, touching and very entertaining. Gary Cooper is my favorite movie actor and here he completely shines. Mr. Deeds is another gem from Frank Capra.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie. It may have been made in 1936, but watching it for the first time in the year 2000 I found that it hasn't dated the slightest bit. Its message is timeless: the good, honest, kind-hearted guy is usually the one persecuted, laughed at, by a society who "doesn't even know what it wants" (a quote from one of the main characters in the film). Gary Cooper is excellent as the shy, humble guy in question. While he's definitely not painted as an angel (he has the tendency to hit people, a lot, but always with just cause ;) he nevertheless manages to wonderfully convey the character's innocence in terms of his exposure to "true" human nature. Of course, while the plot might seem like it would be a downer, this is still a Frank Capra film we're talking about. Capra manages to balance the comedy and drama so well I'm speechless..Really, a charming movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town represents an era in Hollywood that has long since been forgotten. When I heard this romantic comedy about a small town guy who inherites a fortune was being remade by Adam Sandler I felt like killing someone. What is wrong with people that makes them feel they have to deface a classic in order to make money. Hollywood should not be remaking films like this but using them as examples of how to make a great movie. Most romantic comedies today are filled with dirty jokes and skanky sex, and the more of them I see the more I long for another Mr. Deeds. A movie built on charm and innocence, a concept that seems foreign these days. It's one of the best films I have ever seen and maybe Capra's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those guilty pleasures that you may mock today, but will win you over with its slightly sentimental view of triumph of the spirit.Gary Cooper was a master of this type of character and he gives maybe his best performance here. He looked slightly awkward in one of his most famous roles, that of Lou Gehrig, but here he is absolutely believable. As he was nothing like this in real life, it just makes the performance all the more incredible.We all know the formula. Man is taken for a fool and all sorts of seedy people will do anything to exploit that. Woman thinks the same thing but is gradually enchanted by the man.There is not many surprises in the plot. Good will triumph over evil and the hero will get the girl. Therefore, I found myself a little surprised that I liked this so much. We belong in a more cynical era, I guess, and people like Longfellow Deeds would surely be ridiculed today as well. That is why this film is strangely relevant today as it was then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm blown away. First of all, I didn't even know there WAS an original Mr. Deeds until a few weeks ago. Then to watch the original and see what they based the modern one off of just makes me mad. I mean the 1936 version just does something to you inside...it's like a warm hug from a person you love. I sure didn't feel that from the modern version. Hell, I don't remember feeling that anytime I watch modern movies. I sure haven't seen many black and whites but off the top of my head, It's a Wonderful Life, 12 Angry Men and a few others really make you long for something similar to be made today. I use to HATE when my older sister would watch black and whites....I guess the taste buds do change with age. I want to compile all the great black and whites of the day and have my future kids watch one a week, this stuff should NEVER die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the past, I have sometimes found myself able to enjoy Capra's populism and sometimes unable. I go back and forth on the philosophy, as well as the director's sentimentalism. The day I watched Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, I just wasn't buying it. Gary Cooper plays a bumpkin who inherits $20 million from an uncle he didn't even know. He's spirited off to New York City, where the media are chomping at the bit to find out more about him. Reporter Jean Arthur pretends to be another stranger in the city and befriends Cooper, secretly writing newspaper articles about how dumb he is behind his back (a plot line that the Coen Brothers adopted for The Hudsucker Proxy). The movie is never particularly bad. I enjoyed it at some points. But I can't say I was ever really interested in it. And it devolves into my single least favorite classic movie cliché, a courtroom sequence where the audience laughs uproariously at every revelation. Cooper, of whom I'm not a big fan, gives one of his better performances, and Arthur, of whom I am a big fan, is, as always, wonderful. The film got a bunch of Oscar nominations, but Arthur was sadly left out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an amazing film and perfect casting by Frank Capra who knew that Gary Cooper was destined for the part of Longfellow Deeds. He was proved correct in that it earned Gary Cooper his first Best Actor nomination. Deeds, corny postcard poet of Mandrake Falls, inherits 20 million dollars from a rich uncle. He is urged to move to New York into his late uncle's mansion so that he can settle the estate and tie up all the loose ends.His inheritance becomes huge news and the hot shot reporter Babe Bennett played with gusto by Jean Arthur is soon hot on the trail of her target and nicknames him "Cinderella Man".Naturally, they fall in love, naturally he finds out how she has been deceiving him all the time by pretending she is someone else.But in the meantime, he is impressed by the plight of the ordinary farmers in the massive Depression that has hit the U.S.A. and starts to set up help for them.He is soon deemed insane and a court hearing is heard where all the plot threads are then tied up, and very neatly too.What delights and surprises me on the many viewings I've had of this movie over the years is that it is not the simple cornfed aw-shucks type of Capra movie that some make it out to be. I find there is a darker side, the sudden erupting cruel rages of the hero, Longfellow, the stubbornness in court, the quite awful poetry and the fact that he is obviously no one's fool. I am truly pixillated by him.9 out of 10. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But that's okay because "Mr. Deeds Goes To Town," is a wonderfully poetic, romantic and screwball comedy that will make even the most hardened person smile.Based on a serialized novel called "Opera Hat" by Charles Budington (heh) Kelland, the film opens with the car-related death of financier Martin Semple. Newspapers are more than eager to know the relative who inherits Semple's $20 million fortune, annoying the estate holders, the law firm, Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington (again, heh). Lead shyster John Cedar (Douglas Drumbille) has to find the lucky person because of the firm's $500,000 debt, due to their "creative bookkeeping". The firm really needs attorney power over the cash. Cedar and two assistants find the person in Mandrake Falls, a small hamlet in Vermont: 28-year-old Longfellow Deeds (an earnest Gary Cooper, who got an Oscar nomination for the role), a shy, eccentric, non-smoking, non-drinking, tuba-playing poet. He loves his hometown, and the people there love him. When Deeds comes to New York City to claim the fortune, he stands out as an easy mark, a yokel. He's even dubbed in news articles as "The Cinderella Man" by streetwise reporter, Louise "Babe" Bennett (a sweet, lamb-like Jean Arthur), after her enchanting night-outs, under the guise of poor luck girl Mary Dawson, with the naive Deeds. To the city, he's a goofball, but, after some more time, Bennett sees Deeds as a misunderstood, reflective, sensitive and beautiful soul. He's also two-fisted, verbally and physically, striking down phonies who ridicule him while unaware he's fallen in love with one. Bennett knows she's one, She can't take the words back, but falls for him regardless, and love and humanity conquers all.Thanks to Oscar-winning director Frank Capra (It Happened One Night, Meet John Doe {with Cooper} and It's a Wonderful Life) and his witty scribe pal Bob Riskin, "Deeds" is a smart and smart-aleck satire that celebrates the underdog, giving him wealth and fame, but retaining his dignity and honor. Cynics and money-loving sharks may pounce on him, but Deeds stands tall and strong, even with friends like the law firm's gravel-voiced P.R. man, Cornelius "Corny" Cobb (Lionel Stander, who later played Max the car driver of the romantic detective TV series, "Hart To Hart") and baby-faced lead butler Walter (Raymond Walburn) and, later, Bennett herself, during the film's climax. The cast is fun (look out for Western character actor George "Gabby" Hayes as a luckless farmer), the story echoes Shakespeare while being socially conscious (Deeds helps out the victims of the Great Depression, in a way that irks the firm) and Capra and Riskin had a good time orchestrating it.Stay far away from the Adam Sandler remake. He and his comic sensibilities pollute the original film's humanism and individualism while going for cheap laughs from his usual audience who ignorantly equate black and white films with horse poop. The superior pseudo-remake, the Coen Brothers' "The Hudsucker Proxy", starring Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh (who's cute in nylons and heels and sports a funny Kate Hepburn drawl) and a gruff Paul Newman, is delightful as "Deeds" itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My absolute favorite film of all time. Capra did a number of films which are rightly considered classics (as well as a number of challenging if flawed pieces at both the beginning and end of his directing career). Every single scene sends me into paroxysms of joy. Gary Cooper was probably the sexiest man to have ever lived, and I could be content to watch him eat a bag of potato chips -- but oh the dialogue! I am a sucker for good dialogue. And how simply and elegantly the ideas are presented! Capra refrains from becoming too heavy-handed here; there are melodramatics, of course, but only when it's absolutely appropriate, and it absolutely is, every time.Jean Arthur is great as always; thoughtful but not overbearing, emotive without the ham. She has an excellent understanding of exactly what is needed in each scene, and she delivers.So completely wonderful and satisfying in every way. Absolutely the best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Longfellow Deeds is a single man living in a small town during the Great Depression, though he is doing all right thanks to his careers in a local tallow factory, as well as a commercial verse writer for advertisements and greeting cards, and he also plays tuba for the town band. A group of lawyers comes to visit him to tell him that he had inherited a $20 million fortune from a rich uncle, while his other nephew inherits nothing. Deeds is indifferent to inheriting the fortune, but follows the lawyers to New York City.Once there, he is overwhelmed by the trappings of wealth his late uncle had had, but he proves a quick study. He gets suspicious of people who demand money from him and fails to fall into traps that treacherous people set for him. All except for one set by a female newspaper reporter whom he falls in love with...The movie provides laughs without losing sight of its subject matter, and all performances are topnotch, especially by the actor who plays Cobb, a genuinely loyal employee of Deeds. The story may be fiction, but there are plenty of real life stories of people who have received fortunes only to come to grief by them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think of Gary Cooper, I picture him from this movie more than any other. He was at the top of his craft when he stepped away from his usual vehicle to star in this little screwball comedy with a simple plot and a lot of heart. Frank Capra knew what he was doing when he halted production to wait for Cooper. The man is Longfellow Deeds. It's amazing to think that this movie was released two years before Superman first appeared in Action Comics. Longfellow and Superman share common morals. Longfellow even has this romantic notion of saving a woman in distress and then falling in love with her, like Superman did. Both women happened to be spunky reporters.Capra directs this film with all the admiration for everyday characters and rainy day morals that we expect from him. Few directors can capture pure magic and the innocent emotions in scenes, Capra somehow manages to string entire films along with it; always fondly and never preachy. After watching this film, you know if Superman were real, he'd look and act a lot like Longfellow Deeds - if he were lucky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper) is a simple, small-town man who spends part of his time writing greeting-card poems, and part practising his tuba-playing. When he suddenly inherits a heft $20 million from a wealthy uncle, Deeds becomes the most famous man in New York, and practically everybody in the city tries to think up a way to get their hands on the money. Deeds' shifty lawyer, John Cedar (Douglass Dumbrille), believes that he can coax this perceived simpleton into handing over the power-of-attorney, in order to hide the thousands of dollars that he has been systematically stealing; Deeds' cousins, Mr. Semple (Jameson Thomas), and his annoying wife, (Mayo Methot), plot a scheme to prove themselves entitled to the amount of the inheritance. Deeds, however, though perhaps a bit naive on first impression, is shrewd enough to know when somebody is trying to swindle him, and he's not afraid to use his fist to show his disagreement.Frank Capra was undoubtedly one of the greatest directors to tackle the screwball comedy, and 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town' is one of his most fondly-remembered. It follows the director's patented style of "Capra-corn," with an innocent young man from a small-town suddenly being given a great responsibility, facing seemingly-insurmountable evils and eventually triumphing to teach and inspire all those around him (a theme re-tried with even more success in 1939 with 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'). Gary Cooper is wonderful in the role, coming across primarily as a good-natured, kindhearted man, but showing a believable streak of anger and control when the situation calls for it.Though Deeds is certainly adept at detecting a fraud, there is one instance in which he never suspects a thing. Despite the efforts of his cynical, hard-edged troubleshooter, Cornelius Cobb (Lionel Stander), a dedicated celebrity newspaper reporter by the name of Louise 'Babe' Bennett (Jean Arthur) manages to get herself into Deeds' life by pretending to be a poor, needy damsel-in-distress. As Deeds and Babe spend more and more time together, the latter gets her all-important front-page stories, and the former ignorantly begins to fall in love for the first time in his life. When he eventually discovers that his only love has been a complete sham, Deeds loses all faith in humanity, and lapses into a bout of depression, leaving the devious lawyer Cedar free to have him deemed insane in order to claim the fortune.One of Capra's greatest talents is the abilities to stack the odds more and more against the main protagonist, until we are almost certain that he won't get through it all (despite, of course, already knowing that there will be a happy ending). When the inevitable triumph of the hero takes place, you cheer along with the rest of the characters, and feel that maybe the world isn't so bad a place after all. Look to whatever Frank Capra film you like; nobody ever orchestrated that feeling better than he.</fullReview>

Dubbed the "Cinderella Man" by the press, he quickly comes under fire for his 'eccentric' behavior. A preachy, syrupy film from director Frank Capra, coated with Hollywood uplift circa 1936. Jean Arthur steals the picture with a delightful performance as a lovestruck reporter, but Cooper is a stolid, expressionless actor (cast in a part which could really use some dimension).

		<shortDescription>A Strange Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the hearing to determine whether Longfellow Deeds should be institutionalized in an insane asylum, a psychiatrist explains the difference between the mood swings of a normal person, which are confined to a narrow range, and those of a manic-depressive, which lurch from one extreme to another. This is the one part of the movie that actually makes sense and is realistic. Furthermore, it is a correct diagnosis.If a normal person inherited a $20,000,000 fortune, which would be over $300,000,000 adjusted for inflation, he might give a portion of it to charity, but he would never give it all away, even if he were perfectly happy before he got the inheritance. But that is what manic-depressives do when they are in their manic phase. They'll pick up a hitchhiker and give him the car.Furthermore, if a normal person were placed in a mental institution against his will by people trying to get possession of his money, he would get a lawyer and defend himself. He would not sit there listlessly at his own hearing, refusing to utter a word, even if he were despondent on account of his having been betrayed by a lover. Only a manic-depressive, in one of his extreme states of melancholy, could reach a state of depression so dark that he would not care if he were institutionalized for the rest of his life.But we are supposed to reject this diagnosis on the part of the psychiatrist. Instead, we are supposed to think of Deeds as a saint, someone who is too good for this world, whose despondency is the result of being overwhelmed by a realization of how evil other people are. However, even though the diagnosis is correct, that in itself would be no reason to confine someone to a mental institution. The lawyer representing Deeds' relatives, who want to get possession of the fortune, argues that Deeds needs to be locked up because his scheme to give all his money away to needy farmers threatens to cause civil unrest and undermine the very foundations of our nation. That is preposterous, and no court would take such an argument seriously. Deeds' excessive philanthropy might be a justification for having a court-appointed fiduciary take control of the inherited fortune for Deeds' protection, although I doubt it. But it would be in no way a reason for locking someone up in an insane asylum.On the other hand, what would justify Deeds' being institutionalized gets very little attention, which is that he routinely assaults people: two poets in a restaurant, a psychiatrist (in a scene we only hear about), the lawyer opposing him at the hearing, and possibly an operatic diva (in another scene we only hear about). Now, anyone who goes around punching people is either going to be arrested and put in prison or confined to a mental institution for the criminally insane. But even though the judge at the hearing witnesses one of those assaults, he seems unimpressed by it.Suffice it to say that much in this movie is totally unrealistic. The real question is, What is it about this movie that people find appealing? We are not like Longfellow Deeds, nor would we want to be like him, nor would we want to live where he did, in Mandrake Falls. He is a virginal bachelor who never married because he dreamt of saving a lady in distress, a na?ve bumpkin living in a small town, where everyone seems a little dotty. Apparently, people like the idea that there are places like Mandrake Falls, even though they would not like to live there themselves; and they like the idea that people like Longfellow Deeds live in towns like that, even though they have no desire to be like him, or even to be around someone like that for very long. It would simply be too dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before You Can't Take It with You , Before Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, before It's a Wonderful Life - There was Mr. Deeds Goes to Town!This is my review on Mr deeds goes to town.The plot goes like this; The kindhearted Longfellow Deeds is suddenly whisked away from his average village life when he inherits a fortune from his late relative and becomes one of the richest men in the country. However, He doesn't know how to use it, and as the money vultures circle, he must defend his own dignity. If any of you know me (which I certainly hope not), you would know that I'm a huge fan of Frank Capra. He delivers such basic story lines into heartwarming classics which cannot be topped.The story of MR deeds is no exception. I just love the morality painted throughout the film. Mr deeds doesn't want to ruin his lifestyle with money as he was content with what he owned, and valued love over money. How could you not like that? It follows some elements of the "prodigal son" story, showing that most fat cats in the city would only grant you friendship if you had loads of money. To Mr Deed's advantage, hes played one of the giants, Gary cooper. Have you ever seen him do a bad performance? nope. me either- and this is no exception. He makes the character have a sense of innocence and ignorance but you and the audience know too well that he is smarter than he looks. Props to Mr cooper for another brilliant performance.The film also shows the difference between love for self and love for others. Mr deed's love interest Babe Bennett is a cleverly a mix of both, wanting the cash and Mr deeds's heart. She plays a double agent for the press to expose the new millionaire's secrets. However, his undeniable charm gradually wins her over, but by then it's too late. Mr deeds goes to town is one of those films that you should go in without much knowledge of the plot, in order to enjoy it further. The comedic moments are genuinely hilarious, the duologue is well written and the plot is completely unique. While its not as memorable as It's a wonderful life it is an unforgettable film.A delightful, heartwarming film to be watched again and again. I'm giving it a 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For he's a jolly good fellow ...and no viewer can deny ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", the film that earned Frank Capra his second Academy Award for Best Directing, might not be as prestigious as such classics as "It Happened One Night", "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" or "It's a Wonderful Life" and not as 'emotionally loaded' but boy, what a delightful and enjoyable film, still deserving of being put in Capra's Top Five.I intentionally mentioned "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" since it's easy to find similarities with "Deeds", in the title's construction first, but more importantly in the very basis of the plot: the everyday common man facing the morally corrupted society. In fact, it is the main pattern of most Capra's films: a man is forced to evolve in a world that is totally new to him and then tries to adapt to it with what remains his greatest asset: a heart of gold, strong beliefs and principles.Indeed, Smith was a boy ranger who became a Junior senator, he tried to come up with a bill authorizing the buying of a part of his homeland for a national boys' camp. Bailey was a man who dreamed of traveling and exploring the world but was forced by circumstances to stay in his small hometown allowing people to own homes for very low prices. And Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper) inherited a big fortune and decided to help the poor farmers struck by the Great Depression.These Capraesque heroes, so noble in their spirit, are generally seen with suspicious eyes by a category of crooked yet powerful men (businessmen, lawyers or politicians) and when they finally realize that their malicious schemes are undermined by the hero's behavior, they try to put him down. Senator Payne accused Smith of profiting from the bill, Mr. Potter pushes Bailey to bankruptcy while Bailey himself believes his all life was a failure. And for good old Longfellow, his eccentric behavior all through the film is exploited for an accusation of insanity.Longfellow Deeds is from a bucolic little town in Vermont, named Mandrake Falls. It's a sort of comedic Bedford Falls, where people are certainly less wised up by city folks. And when a wise guy from New York, Lionel Standers as Cobb meets a local worker and asks him if he knows about Longfellow Deeds, the hilarious exchange alone illustrates a real 'clash of civilizations' in microcosm. And Deeds is not disappointing as far as eccentricity is concerned, he writes poems for postcards, he's a tuba player, he's very casual about his new fortune, but if his insanity runs in Mandrake Falls, it "will practically gallop" in New York.Deeds' social integration will reveal to be a difficult exercise, too weird especially when he's drunk, too childish or too violent, Deeds is not the typical 'wags-to-riches' character. A series of articles published by 'Babe', unbeknownst to Deeds who falls in love with her, earn him the nickname of 'Cinederella Man' to his great displeasure, and takes advantage of his behavior while drunk to portray him as a weird guy. Jean Arthur is again perfect as the girl who takes advantage of the hero first before realizing that this naiveté is just a raw diamond, and redeems herself by helping him. By the way, how Jean Arthur never got one nomination for a Capra film is beyond me.So, through comedy, Capra denounces the way generosity's meaning is generally perverted by malicious people, either you're crooked or naive, or a loser, or simply crazy. The screwball format of the film doesn't deprive it from the inspirational touch, so typical of Frank Capra, this unique way to reconcile people with values that sound 'sappy' to the wise guys. Capra probably felt responsible, as the son of Sicilian emigrants who went through poverty, to address positive messages for Americans: yes, generosity is not only a positive; it's also an indispensable value. Without it, America would become an unlivable jungle where the survival would rely on the richest or the most politically influent (which is the same).Frank Capra delivers his messages through a wonderful performance from Gary Cooper as a naive man with solid principles. He's eccentric but never does he break the point of craziness. As usual, Capra finds the right balance between laughs and emotions. And whether for Smith, Bailey or Deeds, the truth always triumphs, because behind every great men, there's a woman, and these men all have a guardian angel who believes in them. And the climactic confrontation is certainly the greatest moment from the film with its highlight taking in one single word: 'pixilated' delivered by Deeds' brave aunt.Yes, he's pixilated, his behavior oscillates between totally contradictory moments, but so is the majority of the brave people of Mandrake Falls, every one is pixilated. The word that was used as an accusation turns into a great alibi when Deeds admits he does have strange habits, but so do the others, and especially when they're drunk. In one of the film's most brilliant part, Deeds remarkably points out everyone's strange habits: O's fillers, nose twisters, doodlers ? being a doodler myself, I could relate to it. It's one of the few films, even for comedies, where the climax is based on a humorous tone, with the judge's verdict as a fitting apotheosis..The musical theme of the film is the 'Jolly Good Fellow' song which perfectly fits the character of Longfellow Deeds and the overall cheerful mood of Capra's screwball classic. And if the film doesn't have as memorable villains as in other Capra's movies, I'd like to recall one line from Ebert and Siskel, who said that a good villain is generally one who enjoys being evil.And what makes Capra films so great is precisely the fact that they feature protagonists who enjoy being good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Small town Tuby player and poet Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper) finds out he is the heir to his uncle's estate and moves to New York to take it over. He finds that more is expected of him than he is willing to give, that people he's supposed to trust are not necessarily trustworthy, and that the press is out to make a monkey out of him any chance they get. He gives them plenty. When a young woman in distress (Jean Arthur) gets Cooper's sympathy after fainting in front of his New York home, he plays her knight in shining armour. What he doesn't realize is that she is newspaper reporter Babe Bennett who is willing to lead him into all sorts of embarrassing situations to get on the front page. Then, when he discovers the truth, he decides to give up all of the money to needy farmers and ends up in court. This is where the comical situations of the first 3/4 of the movie turn into a serious message film, and the so-called "Capra-Corn" comes out in spades.The early Roosevelt post-depression/pre-World War II era of New York is fully felt as the New Deal has been good for some, bad for others, and brought out the selfishness and greed in people who thought they could control the small-town "Cinderella Man". The film is filled with wonderfully wacky characters, most memorably eccentric poet Walter Catlett, "Pixilated" sisters Margaret McWade and Margaret Seddon, psychoanalyst Gustav von Seyffertitz, and Cooper's right-hand man Lionel Stander. The wonderful Ruth Donnelly is great as Babe's tough but ultimately tender sister. Douglas Dumbrille is appropriately smarmy as the estate's shady lawyer, and H.B. Warner is memorably sympathetic and tough as the judge in Longfellow's trial. There's a wonderful "echo" scene between Cooper and his male servants (which includes the wonderfully prissy Franklin Pangborn and Barnett Parker), and a great scene where Cooper turns down money for the opera much to the board member's surprise.If the term "Capra-Corn" is ever used to be condescending, it fails because the Capra pictures take stories we see in the paper every day, play them out with an "every man" viewpoint, then serves up a finale where a message of decency and morality (as well as a bit of "we are our brother's keeper") with a message presented entertainingly but very directly. Cooper's decency softens the tough Arthur and proves to many cynical people (including raspy voiced Stander) that money cannot buy happiness and can sometimes lead only to misery. It is a serious message taught with comical overtones that only Frank Capra could do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper) inherits a large estate from his uncle, and "goes to town" in order to manage it. But what is a small-town boy with no use for money going to do with it? And what about all the stories in the press mocking him as being crazy? I was not familiar with Gary Cooper prior to this film. I had some knowledge of Frank Capra, what with having recently seen "It Happened One Night" (which was quite good, but this was better). I can now say I love Gary Cooper. He comes across as witty, charming, and is easily the perfect actor to fill the role that he was given.What strikes me as odd about this film is Frank Capra's anti-communist position, yet pro-distribution message. Capra is on record for being a Republican and anti-communist, and served in both World Wars. Yet, in this film, one of the main plot points is that the country is in ruins due to the Great Depression, and the farmers are being helped by Deeds and his redistribution plan. Is the difference personal versus government intervention? I don't know...Either way, a very fun, funny and lovable picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pixilated man against the "normal" crowd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a shame that this wonderful, charming, funny movie had to be remade back in 2002 starring Adam Sandler for now whenever the title Mr. Deeds is mentioned, the majority of people will recall that train wreck instead of this timeless story. What director Frank Capra is able to do here is create a tale of little city versus big city but also in dealing with corruption and helping out your fellow man.These are themes common to nearly all Capra films and here Gary Cooper is able to transcend the idea of a major Hollywood star playing a down to earth, small-town idealist nice and considerate to all he meets unless they get deep under his skin. To those who reside in the giant city of New York, a bewildered man like this Longfellow Deeds would certainly stick out. And it is for this reason that a hotshot reporter would attempt to use him as a basis for an exclusive story and solely for her own benefit. This other theme of the dark side of media use is another Capra feels strongly about and it shines through especially in the final courtroom scenes when all is revealed and the true colors of all characters are established.Gary Cooper is one of the most under-appreciated leading men in Hollywood history, perhaps because he didn't show the archetype leading man quality other big stars of his time did. He was always in his movies a good old boy, filled with love for his roots and the people he associated with that. He did it here and in Sergeant York, the result being two of his best performances in a long and storied career. Capra favorite Jean Arthur doesn't do or say much- until the epilogue when her character is needed most. And in this sequence, Arthur shows her complete variety of ability to cover both comedic and dramatic areas. Certainly a film to go back to again and again, this shows Capra's ability to carefully touch on very serious subjects with a deft comic touch as well as the great chemistry between Cooper and Arthur. So, if someone mentions Mr. Deeds to you, look for the older one and not the newer "modern" version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some great actors have an uncanny ability to shed their own selves and become absolutely the character they are playing. Other actors, equally great, can take a character as scripted and wrap that character around their own persona. Gary Cooper was among the best of the latter. It's not that he was inflexible or that he was perpetually typecast. It's just that all of the many individuals Coop played, be it The Virginian, Sergeant York, Marshall Will Kane or of course Mr Deeds, they were all just Gary Cooper in a different hat. It was his familiar warmth and down-to-earth steadiness that make his pictures so enduringly popular.Consider the fact that a later film, Mr Smith Goes to Washington was originally commissioned as a sequel to Mr Deeds Goes to Town (entitled Mr Deeds Goes to Washington), and Cooper was originally slated to reprise the character. The part eventually went to Jimmy Stewart, another of these wonderful persona actors. On paper the two characters are near enough identical, and find themselves in very similar situations, but was natural for Stewart to play Smith as a giddy grown-up schoolboy, just as it's natural for Coop to play Longfellow Deeds as a simple yet honest country fella. Mr Deeds was a creation of that superb screenwriter Robert Riskin, and many of his funniest lines (such as "Tell the gentleman I'm not in" when the "gentleman" in question has already walked into the room and started talking) could have come from the lips of Robert Williams in Platinum Blonde or Clark Gable in It Happened One Night, both of which were also scripted by Riskin, but Cooper delivers the lines and makes them his own.Let's talk a little more about Riskin's work here. Not only was he one of the wittiest writers and shrewdest definers of character of his generation, he was also one of the most skilled jugglers of comedy and drama. There are rarely any completely serious characters in a Riskin screenplay, and even the dames tend to be a bit daffy (which is why Jean Arthur is such an ideal leading lady here), but every individual is a believable human being, perhaps not so different to someone we have met in real life. Riskin also has this knack for making sentimentality work by making it very direct but never laying it on too thickly. For example, in the scene at Mandrake Falls we are given an impression of the town with just a few simple elements - the corny poetry on the welcome sign, the forgetful old man and the homely Miss Meredith. The schmaltz is balanced just right so that a mere five minutes of screen time later Mr Deeds' farewell to his hometown is genuinely moving.Finally, we come to the direction of Frank Capra. Like Mr Deeds, Capra's style behind the camera was down-to-earth and unpretentious. Most of the picture is shot in long, still takes. There are few close-ups, so that whenever there is a close-up it is noticeable and meaningful. The main distinctive feature of Capra's direction is the way he puts the camera within the action. Some directors are coldly aloof, while others constantly place us in the hero's shoes with point-of-view shots, but Capra gently places the audience in the position of an extra within the scene. For example, when Deeds sits with the "Literati", it's as if the camera is occupying another seat at the table. It's an effective technique, because makes us feel as if we are there, but does not demand we become anything more than a passive observer. This formula of camera within the set even extends to the actor's placement in relation to it. When Jean Arthur confesses her love for Deeds to her boss, Capra has her deliver her lines with her back to the camera. The impression I get here, is as if the character is too ashamed even to show her face to the audience.Mr Deeds Goes to Town is a delightful relic of a bygone age, before film-making became a mess of technical stylisation, when direction meant nothing more than finding the best way show the story and performances. And returning to our Mr Cooper, his was also an age when actors could adapt a character to fit themselves, and still turn in a credible performance and maintain the respect of the industry. You see, what a player like Coop does, he brings his own brand of likability to Mr Deeds, and that is what makes the picture work. And that's something that method acting, for all its authenticity, can never guarantee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Deeds is a good man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Longfellow Deeds lives his simple life in a small town called Mandrake Falls, Vermont writing poetry in the greeting cards and playing his tuba.Then it all changes when he finds out he has inherited fortune of 20 million dollars from his late uncle, Martin Semple.His uncle's scheming attorney, John Cedar locates Deeds and takes him to New York City.Ex-newspaper man Cornelius Cobb has to keep the reporters away from the heir.But the star reporter Louise "Babe" Bennett finds her way to him.She becomes the damsel in distress when she fakes she's nearly fainting and pretends to be a poor worker named Mary Dawson.So they go out and she writes articles about Deeds and mocks him by calling him the Cinderella Man.But she starts falling for him.Eventually he finds out the truth about her and doesn't want to see her anymore.He wants to get rid of all the fortune he has for it has caused him nothing but trouble.He becomes aware of that when a poor farmer breaks into his mansion and threatens him with a gun.The man blames him of doing nothing for the poor.He decides to provide fully equipped 10-acre farms free to thousands of homeless families if they will work for the land for several years.But soon Mr. Deeds finds himself from the courtroom accused of being mentally incompetent.Many people have come to testify that he's crazy.Mr. Deeds is deeply depressed and can't get a word out of his mouth.Only the love of "Babe" can bring him back.Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) is directed by one of all-time greatest directors Frank Capra.Gary Cooper is great in his part.He was born to play this small town man who finds the cruelty of a big city.Jean Arthur is lovely as "Babe", the woman who finds the soul she had lost.George Bancroft is very good as his editor MacWade.Lionel Stander is marvelous as Cornelius Cobb, who becomes a good friend to Deeds.It's a heartbreaking scene when he tells Deeds the truth about "Babe" and he sinks into depression.Douglas Dumbrille plays John Cedar and he's great in his part.Raymond Walburn is brilliant as the butler Walter.H.B. Warner plays Judge May, and he did a great job also in Capra's It's a Wonderful Life the next decade playing the drunken druggist, Emil Gower.Walter Catlett is superb as the drunken poet Morrow who takes Deeds to see the town.John Wray gives a strong performance as the starving farmer.It's sad to see this poor man breaking into tears.The silent movie star Billy Bevan is seen as Cabby.And also Charles Lane is in the picture in an uncredited role playing Hallor- Lawyer for Common-Law Wife.Lane was known from some other Capra works also and he lived to be 102 years old dying in 2007.Mr. Deeds is a romantic comedy that makes you feel good, one with a happy ending.This movie was made in the middle of the Great Depression.It's a great movie to watch now that we're apparently heading for a greater depression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is kind of the like the other earlier Capra movie "It Happened One Night", only the other way around. The female role has changed into the male role and the male journalist role into the female one. It's of course luckily not entirely the same. The movie is not restrained by limited locations and the characters are of course also different. The two main characters for instance already like each other from the start, which of course makes the movie and its love-story a totally different one.On top of that it has a better written story in my opinion, even though "It Happened One Night" is a more respected movie than "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", also award-wise. "It Happened One Night" won 5 Oscars, while this one won only 1. It was nominated for 4 more though, which equals the amount of categories "It Happened One Night" got nominated for, though this movie got also nominated in some less important categories. This movie still received a best picture nomination but it was Capra's directing which earned this movie its only win.I'm not the biggest fan of Capra's comedies though, since they are all in a way so much alike, also from other genre movies from the same time period. But this movie is one of his better comedies though. It isn't the type of comedy that makes you laugh out loud but it's more a movie that is fun and entertaining to watch, due to its light atmosphere and story. It makes it a real easy and pleasant to watch movie.But of course the movie does not only feature purely comical and entertaining moments. It's also a movie with a romantic and more dramatic touch. This is mostly thanks to its well written story, which also features some moralistic and social criticizing elements.It's funny watching Gary Cooper in earlier movies. He still looked so much different and younger than the Gary Cooper that everyone has in their minds when they think about him. This movie earned Cooper his first Oscar nomination. 5 years later he would win his first Oscar for the movie "Sergeant York".Fine enjoyable movie with a heart.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is where Frank Capra first perfected his formula for the common man hero. It is a grand performance by Gary Cooper who is a younger actor when he pulls off this role. Capra wanted to sequel this film with Mr. Smith goes to Washington, but Cooper's studio would not make him available so he had to switch to Jimmy Stewart for the latter film.In a way, this common man hero model was used to model Jed Clampett on the Beverly Hillbillies later. This film is most original for its era. Capra's direction is great &amp; the story of the big city lawyer having already stolen money from the estate before Deeds Uncle died is a classic story which all too often happens in real life.Jean Arthur is great in her role &amp; the sparks between her and Cooper are in evidence in this. Capras formula never gets old as he repeats this type of story later in other films and you always root for the hero type that he created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless Capra and Cooper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They created a lot of grand palaces here, but they forgot to create noblemen to put in them".Has simplicity of story ever been so grand as it is here? Director Frank Capra manages to turn a simple tale of a rural man coming into big money, into a charismatic uplifting lesson to generations past and present. There are no sheep around here for the makers to extract wool from to pull over our eyes, they don't need too, for it is just a plain and honest story to gladden even the hardest of hearts. It's a journey that tickles you pink and then stops you in your tracks with a swift turn of events, it then gives you tension, frustrating pain in the ass tension, and then? Well it's into the delightful realm of Capra.The direction is flawless, I honestly can't find anything wrong here even if it was my wish to do so, the acting is actually to die for. Gary Cooper is simply brilliant in the title role, he takes you with him on his journey from the easy going rural chap at the start of the film-to the quite emotive and strong man coming alive for the finale. Cooper was a class act when playing men with high moral fibre, such is the case here, he layers Deeds with conviction, witness a tonal shift in the film that brings his world crashing down, the grief on Cooper's face has the viewer ready to fight the world for him. Then there's the entire court room sequences as he sits there acting only with expressions, it's special I tell you.Jean Arthur has a back story to the film that makes me admire her all the more, she was only chose quite late on in casting by Capra after he caught her in a small low budget production, and she suffered violently with nerves on each shoot, but the results are incredible as she dominates the camera in every scene she is in, with her delivery, her voice that makes me ache in a good way, this lady covers herself in glory. The supporting cast are also first class, the writing is top dollar, the film is actually perfect across the board, so with that I'm stunned that more golden baldy statues from the Academy didn't come this films way.I was going to watch Mr Smith Goes To Washington after this, but I spent another hour re-watching my favourite scenes from this film. It's a well regarded film in classic movie buff circles, and rightly so, for it's a peerless entry on Capra's CV, and also cements the statement that Gary Cooper deserves his legendary status. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A warm comedy with a deeper message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr Deeds Goes To Town is a sweet and funny film about a small town man who inherits a fortune. However as the movie progresses the viewer starts to realise this is more than a simple comedy. Instead we see a satire on the greed of the rich and their unbelievable selfishness.The story is about Longfellow Deeds and how he reacts to being left a fortune. Throughout the movie many people want a part of the millions and try to steal it due to Deeds' naivety. Incredibly though Deeds sees through their 'offers'. However, despite the advice given by his bodyguard, Deeds starts to date a 'damsel in distress' who turns out to be Babe Bennett a sneaky reporter desperate to get a snoop on the newest millionaire. One thing leads to another and Deeds is in court because he is 'pixellated' which means 'why is he giving money to starving people when rich people need more money'.In the end the apparent naive Deeds turns out to be the 'sanest person in this court room'. Even though the film is funny it stabs deep and hard. Especially with the Comic Relief fund going strong it makes us wonder what a crazy world this is. People earn thousands a week when others barely have enough to eat. It does make us wonder doesn't it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Timeless comedy that doesn't really date and gets more interesting with age. I first saw Mr Deeds Goes To Town when i was a teenager and its always been one of my favourite films of that era.Its one of the few romantic old comedies that appeal just as much to a male audience as it does to a female one,its a shame that its never on the UK main channels any more as I'm sure it would still draw a younger audience today. When i say it doesn't date,is because the female lead of the film{Babe Bennett}plays the strongest character,she is the tough newspaper reporter who sets out to trick him,sell stories on him,eventually destroy him,and then in the end eventually help save him. And what i find really outstanding about this film is the courtroom drama at the end,it has such a long build up.And when you watch it for the first time you never think he is going to defend himself against his charges and when he finally does its well worth waiting for,especially when he hits Mr Cedar the slippery lawyer at the end. If you love old movies this is a must see,and the acting between the main leads Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur is delightful and fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Adam Sandler re-make first, and the two versions co-exist in harmony for me. Sometimes Adam Sandler impresses me, like in the hilarious "wedding Singer" and in "Deeds." The Capra movie is different enough from Sandler's "Deeds" so I had to wait to see what would happen at the end (although I suspected the good guy would win, and of course get the girl.) Both versions of the movie successfully expose and lampoon the greed of rich people and over-paid professionals, and their sense of entitlement. I have sometimes been accused of cynicism, especially where romance is concerned, but this was totally watchable and lovable. The message is so great, ultimately not cheesy.</fullReview>

Because this is just a great slapstick humor movie.Before Adam Sandler, Cary was the man who beat people up like crazy for making a crack at his poems. It was a nice change to see Cary in a different role as the lovable goof who deserves to get the girl at the end and more friends than he's ever had in his life. He and Jean were just adorable together and the whole cast looked like they had a wonderful time.

		<fullReview>I've watched MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN (1936) twice so far; I think it's one of Capra's greatest and most enjoyable films, deservedly earning him his second Academy Award. Gary Cooper, perfectly cast as the amiable simpleton, was at his best here and he too was nominated for an Oscar.Though the overall tone of MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN is relatively light, its professionalism is never in doubt and with this film Capra began in earnest his period of 'message' pictures (his earlier drama American MADNESS [1932], with a backdrop of the Wall Street crash, however had already shown his genuine concern for the 'little people') which culminated in his second collaboration with Cooper ? the ambiguous and rather cynical MEET JOHN DOE (1941). Capra then responded to the real-life hardships of WWII with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946): though it dealt with much the same situations as before, if given a Scrooge-like twist, here it took heavenly intervention (in keeping with several other films of that era like HERE COMES MR. JORDAN [1941] and HEAVEN CAN WAIT [1943]) to put things to right?which somehow seemed to indicate that, according to the director, Man alone could no longer overcome the burdens of everyday life!</fullReview>

Just watch the 30 second or so section when he finds out that his lady love is really the rotten reporter he had expressed a desire to punch out for all the overblown stories written in the city newspaper and the person responsible for dubbing him "the Cinderella Man". The first thing is, he needs to ask her himself- and not take someone else's word for it- but when she admits that yes, she is the reporter behind the stories- but that she can explain (how, I don't know) he hangs up the phone and his face goes through a series of expressions that left me just shaking my head in amazement. Wow- from shocked disbelief to resignation to sorrow and almost tears- to embarrassment at being caught so off guard in front of the people standing around him. Incredible!!! And the whole time being so wonderfully tall dark and handsome! What more could you ask for? I agree with someone else here regarding the "punching out" that Longfellow continually does throughout the movie- almost seems out of character- why the writers felt that someone that wrote poetry, loved so deeply and was so generous needed to go around punching out people that laughed at him- I don't know. But what a great movie and well worth watching if only to see Gary Cooper in action!</fullReview>

I never enjoyed the first roles of Cooper in MOROCCO, yet it looks like he's been improving his acting over the years and his eyes seem to be brighter and emotional with Capra efforts. Jean Arthur is very good too with her sexy voice and tender love. The cast also includes H. B. Warner as the judge and Lionel Stander as Deeds gardian angel with that frog voice. Maybe a bit overlong, however it's moving (not as much as It's a Wonderful Life'), , love triumphs at the end, with the Capraesque final act at the court.</fullReview>

So is Jean Arthur as Babe Bennett, a hard bitten street savvy newspaper reporter, who first thinks of Deeds as a ridiculous rube who makes a wonderful topic for sensationalistic newspaper articles. Why and how she falls in love with him, and finally helps him defeat the opposition for his multi-million dollar inheritance makes a refreshingly hopeful and romantic story, even in the new millennium!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irresistible hit of the 1930s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capra seemingly cannot be outclassed with his stylish, witty comedies of the 1930s. Although always overshadowed in its day by "It Happened One Night" and "You Can't Take it With You", watching a simplistic, younger Gary Cooper is wonderful. It is by far a differed portrayal from his Oscar winning performance in "High Noon", and it is disappointing this movie did not take out more Oscars than it did. Cooper is definitely at his peak as Longfellow Deeds, countryman, poet and tuba player, blessed with an inheritance of $20 million. I originally thought before scanning the opening credits, that this was another Jimmy Stewart, Frank Capra collaboration. The movie is made in Capra's most typical, appealing style, the triumphing of small town man over the big city man. Capra deservedly won the second of three oscars in four years. Screenplay excellent and funny, with the court room scene most memorable of it all, with the word 'pixilated' being introduced to almost every American household. Jean Arthur, Capra's favourite actress is again great as Babe Bennett, the big city reporter who betrays and eventually comes to love the naive country man. In a starring role, Arthur is a great actress, notable in films like "The Talk of the Town" and "The More the Merrier" The supporting cast too is of excellent standards, which can expected in a Capra film.Although this film does not set out to inspire, like other Capra movies "Lost Horizon" and "It's a Wonderful Life", it is still an example of Hollywood in the 1930s at its best. It is another Columbia work to be watched over and over!Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>somewhat neglected Capra Classic was a huge hit in 1930's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Capra gem has been somewhat eclipsed by Mr. Smith Goes To Washington and It's A Wonderful Life. Deeds, however, was one of Capra's most successful movies and was so beloved in its original release that it ran in one theater for a full year- this in the days when movies only lasted in theaters a week or two at the most.It won Capra an Oscar for Best Director.It would be his second Oscar for the decade(Capra won three in the 30's-It happened One Night, Deeds, and You Can't Take it With You). The movie appealed to the Depression American audiences as they watched ordinary,shy Mr.Deeds,played wonderfully by Gary Cooper go up against the phony,pretentious rich people who try to prove deeds insane because he wants to help the downtrodden with his inherited money. The movie has the Capra touches we have come to expect: the sweeping camera,the rat a tat,fast paced montages , the marvelous crowd scenes, and the quirky supporting casts. Capra evidently didn't belive there was such a thing as a small part. And his actors all shine. i especially love Jean Arthur who plays a similar part in Mr. Smith ,the cynical career gal who loses her cynicism as she comforts and loves Gary Cooper. The film's main flaws are its cheap production values. Columbia films from this era often look cheap. The film supposedly takes place in New York City but the street scenes are quite unconvincing, and the crowd scenes for a big city are awfully sparse.Plus there is an annoying echo of the soundstage in the outdoor scenes that reminds you that the scene you are seeing is filmed indoors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is an outstanding movie. There, I said it. There are times when it is downright hilarious. At other times, it is incredibly dramatic. Gary Cooper plays a much different type of character in this than the kind we know from such movies as High Noon. This doesn't mean he was bad. He was outstanding! When you see this one, watch for the Swanne River duet in the park with Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur. Its very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Post-Depression Cinderella fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A feelgood Frank Capra film with a winsome American everyman. Except this isn't It's A Wonderful Life (also a Depression period fable) but a vehicle for the terrifically poised Gary Cooper, who, nevertheless spends a large proportion of the film threatening to lamp those whom he dislikes. The film is fairly straightforward: corporate greed, opportunistic lawyers and a sensationalist media ruining the good intentions of a good man who's come into a fortune. I disliked that the film also got caught up in the same way that Deeds' broadbrush altruism does - Capra finds himself directing an unwantedly knotty courtroom drama just as the film comes to the boil.Still there's plenty of believable wackiness, what with Deeds being a tuba player and the wonderful turn of Lionel Stander as the thug Cobb, a wiseguy who turns out to be the voice of reason, rather like Chazz Palminteri's Cheech in Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway. Cooper doesn't have the range of Jimmy Stewart but he's a camera-friendly leading man. A solid film for a bank holiday. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I wonder why he left me all that money, I don't need it."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time I used to wonder what it would be like to win a million dollars, much less a sum like twenty million. However the older I get, the idea of it doesn't seem to hold the same kind of fantasy it once did. Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper) seems to have figured it out early enough in life; there's not much good a whole pile of money will do if it pulls you away from the person you really are. Now I can't say for a fact that the temptation of it might still not be there, but if I was really all that wishful about it, I'd be out there buying my lottery ticket a couple times a week hoping for a big payoff, but that's not really a priority. Watching a story like this just helps reaffirm what the true qualities in life really are.I think what cemented it for me was the testimony of the Faulkner sisters. Deeds knew what he was doing when he asked them to affirm that he was in fact pixillated. With just the right inference, Longfellow showed that he was just as pixillated as the next man, including the judge, and that wasn't such a bad thing after all. I'm not sure how that scene would actually fly in a real court of law, but it reminded me of the whimsical way it was proved that Santa Claus really did exist in "Miracle On 34th Street". I think it's important to remind ourselves every now and then that there's some really significant wonder in the world after all, and that money and riches don't have anything to do with it.I tried picturing Jimmy Stewart, another Capra favorite, in the role of Longfellow Deeds. I'm sure it would have worked out just fine, but watching Gary Cooper here, I think he wound up being just right. His pairing with Jean Arthur in the role of Babe Bennett wasn't hampered by what might have been that 'aw shucks' kind of temperament that Stewart brings to his roles. Cooper had just the right amount of civility and character to go along with his 'goodness', and it proved to be the winning combination in the end.You know what I found quite interesting though? I've probably seen Gabby Hayes in easily a hundred Western movies and TV shows, but I don't think I've ever seen him handle the delivery of important serious dialog in a movie. He did so here as a representative of the down and out farmers, and that one scene brings me to a new and different appreciation of Hayes as an actor. It was actually a sit up and take notice moment for me, when about the only thing I ever expect to hear out of his mouth is 'ya durn tootin'!I also enjoyed the characters of newspaper editor MacWade (George Bancroft), Cornelius Cobb (Lionel Stander), and banker John Cedar (Douglas Dumbrille). For his part, Dumbrille might have given his best villainous performance here, and that's including any Westerns he might have appeared in with Gabby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful little picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is justifiably one of Gary Cooper's most famous movies, as his character of Longfellow Deeds is a classic of American cinema. Mr. Deeds has just inherited a fortune and Jean Arthur is determined to make him a star in her newspaper reports. She doesn't tell him she's a reporter and insinuates herself in his life in order to further her career as a reporter. She plays the story of a poor boy becoming rich to the hilt, but the story goes off direction when Mr. Deeds shows no interest in the money. In fact, he announces he doesn't want the money and is planning on giving it all away! That's because he so quickly became sick of all the adoration, publicity and people trying to suck up to him for money's sake. And, when he makes this announcement, greedy people take him to court to try to prove he is crazy and shouldn't be the heir to the fortune. This leads to some of the most marvelous and funny scenes in film--especially of the cute old ladies who testifies that Deeds is "pixilated"! A terrific film that you can't help but enjoy--very reminiscent and just a bit better than another Capra-Cooper films, MEET JOHN DOE because it is less schmaltzy and a bit more believable. An American classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic comedies don't come any better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the privilege to watch the recently restored version on the big screen, or at least, a reasonably big screen, in the "Arsenal", the cinema of the Berlin Filmmuseum. And it was simply wonderful, a heart-warming experience. This film leaves you with such a pleasant daze, you almost want to shake hands with every stranger you meet when you're back on the streets.What's there to add about one of the best loved films off all time, packed with gems and first-rate performances? Gary Cooper is just perfect in the title role as the seemingly ignorant small town tuba player from Mandrake Falls, Vermont. When he's informed he has inherited $20 million, he instantly leaves for New York to take care of the estate. Immediately everybody in town wants a piece of him, businessman, relatives and journalists, but he somehow manages to outsmart them all. A deceptively simple story, this film is so much more than just a romantic comedy. There are some of the typical ingredients that so many Hollywood thirties-films contain, such as the typical depression-era social conscience, but when handled this way, it even puts a smile on the face of the most grumpy film theorist or historian. Jean Arthur has never been more appealing than this in a fantastic role as a hard-boiled newspaper journalist who initially is after Deeds too, but - off course - things turn out a little different than she thought. There's a not a single dull moment in the whole film, fast paced, a razor-sharp script and stellar performances all contribute to the enjoyment of the crazed proceedings in this film. One of the many highlights: When Deeds lets his butlers holler in the hall and stairwell of his mansion in order to enjoy the echoes they produce. Priceless!Highly enjoyable, don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pixilated Gentleman From Vermont</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although he had earlier successful films ("American Madness", "The Bitter Tea Of General Yen"), Frank Capra's real success in American movies began with "It Happened One Night", and was quickly solidified by "Mr. Deeds Goes To Town". His position of chronicler of little America (the little man who makes up the bulk of us) and of our habits and behavior was emphasized in "One Night" by putting most of the movie into the less than romantic world of interstate bus travel and tourist camps. In "Deeds" he tackles the little man from small town America (here Vermont)confronting the corruption inside the big city (here America's biggest city - New York City). The success of "One Night" got Capra entry with bigger and bigger stars. Although he had Walter Huston in "American Madness" and a young Barbara Stanwyck in "Bitter Tea", his getting Clark Gable for the role of Peter Warne, and Claudette Colbert for the role of Ellen Andrews - and their subsequently getting Oscars - ensured he could have other big names in the future. So "Deeds" starred Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur."Mr. Deeds" is a film about common sense, which is represented by it's hero. Longfellow Deeds seems a man of eccentricity at first, or "pixiliated" as two elderly neighbors call him. He is living in Vermont, playing his tuba, and writes poetry for greeting cards. But he inherits a fortune, which unfortunately is in the hands of a crooked law firm (headed by John Cedar - Douglas Dumbrille in his best known part). Dumbrille, like most of the urbanites in the story, thinks they can handle Deeds with a line of blarney. But Deeds is not dumb. He wants to see an exact accounting of the estate (Cedar and his partners have been looting it for years). He does come to New York, as his homes are here. But when approached with a phony claim (Charles Lane is the shyster lawyer) he exposes it and throws Lane out. He also makes short work for Madame Pomponi, the opera diva. I always have a little problem with his ruthless refusal to support opera. Deeds is right - it doesn't pay selling tickets to opera like selling movie or baseball tickets, but opera does have it's serious fans and could be supported as a tax right-off.Cedar decides to ruin Deeds by questioning his sanity. He is unwittingly assisted by newspaper editor George Bancroft and his ace reporter (Jean Arthur) who get Deeds to act naturally - but they suggest he is eccentric or worse. A confrontation with some drunk and snooty literary lights (who look like a spoof of the Algonquin Round Table) does not help. Yet one of the literati (Walter Catlett as a decent guy) realizes that Deeds was being sneered at, and befriends him. Others slowly are attracted to him, including his slowly liberated butler (Raymond Walburn, in a surprisingly restrained but effective role), Lionel Stander (austensibly there to help Cedar, but coming to his senses), and Arthur, who is falling in love with him.Eventually there is that sanity hearing, chaired by a sympathetic and suspicious H.B.Warner. Deed's friends and supporters are there to speak up for him. And Deeds does triumph, by explaining his actions, and his intentions to use the fortune properly to help stop the Depression. And we see the film end with Arthur and Cooper united, and a disappointed Dumbrille pushing down his complaining partner.The ending has remained part or movie culture - and got transplanted to television. On "Taxi", Louis Di Palma (Danny De Vito) gives a speech (reminiscent of George Bancroft's in the movie) to bolster Rev. Jim Ignatowski's sanity hearing (he's inherited a fortune too). Unimpressed, the head of that hearing wishes people stopped watching "Mr. Deeds" before coming to his hearings. Perish the thought!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic One Man Against The Masses Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this film because it was a Capra film and has Jean Arthur and handsome Gary Cooper in it. It said on this site that it was a comedy, so I thought great, but it wasn't not quite a comedy to me.A millionaire goes joyriding and goes off a cliff. For some crazy reason leaves his fortune, not to his relatives, but to a man no one seems to know. The people in charge of the late man's money goes out west to meet this man and tell him of his fortune. The man is Longfellow Deeds(Cooper), a small town poet. Once they meet him they see him as a goofy country bumpkin. They tell him that he must come to the big city to claim his fortune. So Deeds leaves his little town, acting like a wide eyed child. He is seeing things now that he has never seen before.He has also become big news. All the papers are quick to learn the story and try to find out all they can about this new millionaire. A certain reporter, Babe Bennett(Arthur), finds a way to run him and spends the night following him around. Our Mr. Deeds doesn't know who she really is. He just thinks she is a everyday Jane, down on her luck. The first REAL person he has met in this big city. Instead of being a good friend like she makes him believe, she is writing cruel stories about him and his "odd" adventures. She has even dubbed him, Cinderfella. Thanks to her stories, everyone turning against him. He is now being known as a Class A Major loony toon. By now, if you haven't guessed it, she has fallen for the big lug. What to do now?? She can't stop what she has created. Our Mr. Nice Guy Deeds is in danger of losing all his money and MORE! This isn't a very funny film to me but that doesn't mean that I enjoyed it any less. The story is a fresh as it was back in the 30's. I couldn't see anyone else play this role except for Gary Cooper(nowadays by Luke Wilson). Jean Arthur was good as the two faced reporter who learns too late what the media can do to someone. Lionel Stander(TV's Hart to Hart) has his best role ever as the loyal wiseguy who tries to keep an eye out for Deeds.A great story, great cast, and great direction, makes this film...well GREAT!! It has a happy ending of course so watch it and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Frank Capra's Masterpiece (Pleonasm)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor spoilersLongfellow Deed (Gary Cooper) is pure and honest man, who loves to play tuba, makes poetry for postcards and is a volunteer fireman in a small city in Vermont. One day, he inherits a fortune of twenty million dollars (in 1936) from a very distant and unknown uncle. He moves to New York and there, he is chased by the press, searching for information about the newest millionaire in USA, and by the opportunists. However, Mr. Deeds is a naive, but also a very intelligent man. The smart reporter Louise `Babe' Bennett (Jean Arthur) pretends to be a woman called Mary Dawson and forges a situation to get close to him. She gets inside information about his life and she puts a nickname on him (`Cinderella Man'). In order to sell newspapers, she makes him a fool through the headlines of her newspaper. However, they fall in love for each other, and `Babe"quit her job. But Mr. Deeds is informed about her true identity and becomes sad and disappointed with human beings. Brokenhearted, Mr. Deeds decides to donate his fortune to the poor and unemployed persons. His former lawyer decides to bring him in the court, stating that he is mad. This film ends in a wonderful trial. First of all, although being a pleonasm, this movie is another masterpiece of Frank Capra. I do not know the magic or spell this director had, but his movies are so wonderful, with such marvelous messages, that is impossible not to love them. In all of the Frank Capra's movies I have watched, he explores the best and the worst of the human race. Mr. Deeds goes to Town is no exception. We have the magnificent character performed by Gary Cooper as a kind of hope in the persons, surrounded by many horrible persons, but making the difference in the end of the plot. This movie is an excellent good family entertainment, which deserves to be watched more than once and with a good and positive message in the end. The Adam Sandler`s remake of 2002 is also a good updated version of this spectacular story and also deserves to be watched. My vote is ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never had the chance to see this movie until now, when I bought the DVD and my husband and I watched it. I sure wish they made movies like this nowadays. Most of my favorite movies were made before I was born, and they're what I show to my children time and time again.Unfortunately, this movie is about to be remade by Adam Sandler, and I just cannot picture him doing justice to the Frank Capra/Gary Cooperclassic! It breaks my heart that millions of younger people are going to see *that* and believe it is an original tale.Anyway, Gary Cooper plays Longfellow Deeds, a small-town man who is the sole heir of his uncle's twenty million dollar estate. He finds himself surrounded by people who mostly want to take advantage of him, including a woman journalist played by Jean Arthur. She is given a job to write articles about him in a rag, and dubs him "Cinderella Man". However, with all the time she spends with him, she finds that he is honest, fresh-minded, and a good man, and starts to fall in love with him. The change in her conscience is very well acted as she starts to hate the job she is given, to deceive and make fun of Mr. Deeds. Meanwhile Mr. Deeds grows tired of fending off all the people who just want him for his money, and decides to give his fortune away to unemployed farmers who have been down on their luck and need new farms to start afresh. This action causes people to try to get him declared insane.I will not spoil the ending for you, but you will find yourself drawn right into this movie and wanting to watch it again and again. It is a very moving, charming, and at times, funny film. Also, you'll find that the DVD version of this film is well done, the transfer is crisp and the picture is very clear. Especially watch out for any New York misty evening scenes.I gave this movie a well-deserved ten stars. Perhaps after the remake comes out enough people will be inspired to watch the original and vote on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet Longfellow Deeds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that it took me a while for Gary Cooper to grow on me as an actor and to see his appeal under his minimalist, low key style of acting. It's been said Cooper's face was the map of American; so why in under God did they cast Adam Sandler in a remake of Mr Deeds Goes to Town?Mandrake Falls is a town full of oddballs, and the naive but not a total dunce Longfellow Deeds comes off as a weirdo to the city dwellers who are fascinated by his behaviour and start mocking him. Mr Deeds Goes to Town certainly highlights the divide between city slickers and small town folk; this is particularly evident in the scene in which Deeds, himself a poet meets a group of distinguished poets in restaurant and is appalled by their snobbery and elitism to the point that he beats them up. Likewise the film also features Charles Lane as a lawyer, the inspiration for the The Simpsons blue haired lawyer. In an example of the darker side of Capra's films, Mr Deeds Goes to Town is a cynical look as society and the media as a whole ("Why do people seem to get pleasure out of hurting each other, why don't they try helping each other once in a while?"). Multiple people are out to snag Deed's fortune while the media is out constantly pursuing him due to his odd but ultimately harmless behaviour; the media manipulating how a person is seen by the public. Mr Deeds is a man who became famous for inheriting a fortune, in other words he's famous for being famous and the newspapers appear to have nothing better to do than report on his escapades such as feeding donuts to a horse; relevant to today's celebrity culture.With the scene in the park in which Babe plays a set of improvised drums and Deeds sings humoresque, Capra didn't want to include it as he thought it was too sappy, but Jean Arthur insisted it remain. Capra of all people thought it was too sappy?! But ah Capra sentiment, it never fails to move me.The sanity hearing at the end of the film is pure movie fantasy; I doubt in real life someone could be classified insane on such so called evidence. In a demonstration of Cooper's ability as one of the best actors when it comes to giving a rousing speech or monologue, he talks about the silly quirks we all have. Although the likes of "o" filling or knuckle cracking seems rather trivial, I'm always left with the impression that the movie is making a statement on society's treatment of those who don't fully "fit in" or adhere to conformity and asks the question; who is truly "normal"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will initially reject the assumption that Capra used consequences "Great Depression" to be played with the taste of the audience. It is too cruel, but it is no accident. Capra make more than a good movie. Mr. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN is a great movie. Deeds, its celebration of the "simple" universal values as opposed to corruption in big cities hit the "wire" of many people.At the heart of the story is an ordinary man from the provinces. Money changes people, but rarely get better. Naive and gullible guy is easy to manipulate in a big city. The big city is synonymous with the perverse financial and media power. Love, honesty and morality oppose cynicism and materialism of society. Too nice to be true, and yet feels the eye and ear. Scene and thematic segments of the film are extraordinary. The romantic comedy is deftly and seamlessly upgraded with ideological messages. Love background of the story does not suffer. Humor is a varied and at times empathic. The acting is very good.Gary Cooper as Longfellow Deeds emphasizes his specialty, behaves normally and every now and then someone down the nose. Character is old-fashioned or roughly "rustic", but from the viewpoint of real value ideal. Little, heart, human and ethical man is unsure of the ?jungle". Cooper is coping quite well.Jean Arthur as Louise "Babe" Bennett/ Mary Dawson She is a journalist tabloids and Lady in distress. Arthur and Cooper did not have a special chemistry. She is part of the changes that go along with the story. Arthur is an actress that individual works well. Paired with the actor who breaks the story, she fits perfectly.All actors have contributed, and I emphasized Lionel Stander! He ends his line with specific and great humor. His character is experiencing a similar change as well as character of major actress.I think Capra empathize with people. The story is perhaps too idealized. How many are actually price the true value? In human relationships are definitely missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I laughed quite a lot near the start of this movie. It clicked for me right away. It's a simple story with an inherently funny concept behind it. A nice man from a little town inherits a large fortune that he doesn't particularly want. He doesn't blink an eye when they tell him how much money he now has. He sits and plays his tuba a bit. The city people don't think he understands. But he does, it just doesn't affect him. His new acquaintances take a while to get used to his personality and its hilarious seeing their reactions at his unexpected behaviour.Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is full of hilarious moments. Several adults have fun creating echoes in a mansion. Deeds looks around to make sure nobody is watching before he rides down a stair railing. He plays the tuba at his own farewell party even as he gets on a train and then later worries about where they'll find a replacement tuba player. He points out the personal ticks of multiple people who then struggle to keep still without involuntary movement arising again. A very touching moment is followed by some perfectly executed slapstick comedy that comes out of nowhere.I find the most annoying kind of people are those that overact to everything, going through extreme emotions constantly. Panicking, complaining, gossiping, getting over-excited. Mr. Deeds is the opposite - always calm and collected and very direct with what he says. But he is passionate about justice as well and throws a punch several times in the movie. He enjoys a simple life but is not stupid in the way people expect him to be. He sees through people and calls them out on their hypocrisy. He can tell when he is being manipulated.I really liked Gary Cooper in the title role. He makes the character seem innocent and charming. Jean Arthur has a funny, high-pitched voice but she's likable as the conflicted love interest. She is also like a child, spending free time trying to shake a rope into a knot. Frank Capra's direction is effective, keeping the focus on the main characters and their emotions.Mr. Deeds is a funny movie with a powerful message. It's full of nice details. There is even some darkness and tension. His purity and simple refusal to lie or do things for personal benefit shames others into becoming better versions of themselves. His life was rich before he inherited the money and he enriches the city with his outlook on life and incorruptibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first part of this movie is a very well done romantic comedy, in which first-rate actors, led by a first-rate director (Capra), bring to very real, moving life a first-rate script.Then the farmer shows up with the gun, and the movie moves into a different realm, that where greatness resides.Deeds discovers the joy of helping his fellow man, or more specifically those of his fellow men who are willing to work to help themselves.At the same time, we see, through the lawyer, that dispersal of large fortunes - an issue in an era when there was still some respect for anti-trust laws - is presented as a threat to the very nation. Rather similar to the cries that came from our "too big to fail" banks when, after they caused the Great Recession, some in government tried to bring them under control.We also see that the powers of high finance can buy medicine - the psychiatrist from Vienna who doodles - to support their case. (This movie is almost frighteningly relevant to our own times.) We marvel at a man who realizes that the real happiness his fortune can buy is the chance to help those who need help, rather than to spend it on himself.This movie gets a 10 from me only because that's as high as the scale goes. Up until the farmer appears, it's a very well made romantic comedy. From there to the end, it's truly off the charts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful philanthropic film made in the turbulent times of 1930s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful philanthropic film made in the turbulent times of 1930s.In 1933 during Great Depression, a wealthy man called Longfellow Deeds decides to go philanthropic and is accused of insanity too. The film in many ways is a testament to philanthropy and what money does to empower people and also how money acts as an evil to the bad fellows.The film is done well in terms of photography, sound and editing. It tops in writing and directing. I love the way Frank Capra puts out his films, though there are some cinematic liberties, overall it panned out well. There were a few questionable liberties too, but all is well if it ends well. Precisely, that is what happens with the film.Gar Cooper as Longfellow Deeds is wonderful and Jean Arthur as Louise "Babe" Benett was lovely, charming and admirable. The way Jean Arthur connives Deeds is wonderful too. Of course, there are moments where, Deed conveys how all the people he met in his life are fake and how lovable Babe is, show that is these are pure Capra moments, the initial master who drew emotions with a tear in the eye. Frank Capra began the march toward greatness with his earlier film "It Happened One Night" and continued it with this and his other wonderful films too.The film stands tall in history with several remakes or references down the years and is one of the finest to have come out in 1930's. Yet, I rate a few films of Frank Capra above this and I am going with a 3/5. Yes, it's lovable but it does not demand a repeat watch, unlike his other films. So thus, putting my rating down a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This review may contain spoilers ***Capra just knew how to do it. The 30s were his decade, and by the end of it, he had 3 Academy Awards to call his own (and may even have won one more for Mr Smith, if it wasn't for Gone with the Wind). Everything about this movie is perfect. The pacing, the dialogue, the acting, the plot.Gary Cooper is wonderful as the idealistic small town tuba player who inherits a small fortune and has to move to the big city, where he'll soon become ''the victim of every conniving crook in town''. Like most of Capra's heroes, he's a playful man-child who slides down bannisters, chases fire engines and grins on hearing echoes. And although he's not as naive as the lawyer Mr Cedar initially hopes, he's genuinely confused by the cynic attitudes of the people around him. Cooper plays beautifully, is convincingly bashful, funny and heartbroken over the course of the film, and really deserved his Academy Award (the close-up of Longfellow's reaction on hearing of Babe's betrayal is especially praiseworthy).But having said that, Jean Arthur's performance is equally brilliant as the cynic reporter who worms her way into Deeds's confidence and writes insulting articles about the ''Cinderella Man'' behind his back, only to fall in love with him herself. Babe's transformation is utterly credible, and beautifully done, so you can't help but root for her in the end.The rest of the cast is superb too, of course, particularly Lionel Stander, George Bancroft and Ruth Donnelly.Mr Deeds is Capra's first film where he consciously tries to bring across his ideas to the public, ideas which champion the little man, the insignificant man, the individualist.I first saw this at the age of 14, and it just blew me away, because it's just so much more sophisticated than the majority of the comedies produced today (although Mr Deeds can't really be classified as just a comedy ? that's another wonderful thing about it.) Anyway, it was this film that got me into all the classics of the 30s and 40s, and then eventually, into all kinds of films in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man of Dreams with Common Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that make everyone different is because we all have different dreams, different desires as to what we want out of life or how we feel the world should work. I'll admit I do have a soft spot for director Frank Capra and his films, despite how much time has gone by the content has always made them timeless (in my book anyway) this is my second favorite film from him.I do like the story, it's true that it may seem a tad unrealistic in places but it's a movie what do you expect and realism is boring (to me anyway). And the plot is a bit plausible, who's to say no one inherits a big fortune.What make this story stand out for me are the characters and what they do throughout the film, that to me is one of the reasons why I like most of Frank Capra's film are that their actually concerned about characters not just plot line alone.I really like the protagonist Longfellow Deeds played brilliantly by Gary Cooper. His character I find relatable and easy to emphasize with because I myself am a bit like him, because the thing about him is he's an outsider, he simply want to just do his own thing. Three things I really like about the guy are the fact that he isn't afraid to act on his feelings or do what he feels like doing. One example is when he hears a fire brigade and runs to help out, nothing wrong with that personally I think it's the most sensable thing to do, help where help is needed.Another is the fact that he loves playing the Tuba because it makes him feel good and think, for me it's writing or physical exercise. But also it's just plain fun, there doesn't have to be a reason for it. But most importantly that his heart truly is in the right place, he's selfless he really does care about other people along with his significant other Babe Bennet.Babe Bennet (Jean Arthur) I also like she's a strong female character, I really like the chemistry between both Longfellow and her I felt it was believable; this film is also one of the only romance stories I actually like because of that.She's a character that you can easily forgive because of her redemptive quality. At first she kinda starts out as a bad guy, well OK not exactly more of a person whose head is in the wrong place. She goes out with Deeds at first for the wrong reason, to her he is her ticket to fame and success though exploitation and slander of his character; even she at first believes the lies. But of course as she spends more time with Deeds, he actually touches one thing she's lost touch with for so long her heart and she realizes that he's the real deal. From that we hope it's not too late for her to do the right thing but also for Deeds to forgive her somehow.I even like how the film despite having comedy and fun isn't all fun and games but actually the film is a bit dark from the prejudice he's forced to endure and takes a really unfun turn when it gets down to the trial scene. Which was a ploy to both hinder Deeds selfless act but worst of all inflict disgusting prejudice for being him.Most of that the work of John Cedar (Douglas Dumbrille)whom is just a greedy blowhole whom has only one goal in mind which is just to get more money then he already has. But he's also a hypocrite, throughout most of the film he's trying to make himself seem like the good guy looking out for everyone, but in reality he doesn't give a crap about anyone else and is just looking out for just him.I'll admit that just made me feel heavy pathos for Deeds, but that just all the more made me want the character to win. Personally I feel Deeds was simply doing the right thing let alone the sensible thing. Deeds as he stated was content with not having a big fortune, why wouldn't he put it to good use, actually why wouldn't anyone. As well as the bile crap he had to endure from some of the beginning to the end of the film which I felt was uncalled for, most of the sources that have brought this on him are unreliable and don't even know him. So what if he does this or that, or is simply different he's not harming anyone; we're all individuals we all do our own thing as well, it's human nature you can't stop this.This film has I feel a couple of good messages about the importance of being selfless, if you have the ability or opportunity then use it. But most importantly an anti-prejudice message, we should accept people for who they are for whatever makes them unique.A man of dreams are the kind of men that make big or small differences because they have the ability to turn dreams into reality.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious &amp; Heartfelt Comedy Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra struck gold again in this hilarious and heartfelt comedy/drama starring Gary Cooper as Longfellow Deeds, a simple(yet shrewd) small-town Vermont resident who inherits a great deal of money from his uncle. He moves to the city, where he quickly becomes the target of moochers and swindlers, whom he unexpectedly outwits, but meets his match in cynical female reporter Babe Bennett(played by Jean Arthur) who fools Deeds into thinking she loves him, and gets exclusive material for her cruel headlines. When his right-hand man Cornelius Cobb(wonderfully played by Lionel Stander) wises him up about her, he becomes despondent, and becomes a target by those who claim he is insane in order to take the money away from him. Strange thing happened though: Babe realizes that she really does love him...Classic comedy is a complete joy from start to finish, with outstanding direction and performances, and an original and insightful script with many pertinent things to say about wealth and sanity, sincerity and phoniness that are just as true today. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People here are funny..they work so hard at living they forget how to live......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Frank Capra this 1936 classic is one of the best don't follow the crowd just be yourself tales ever filmed.This is the film that started screwball comedy and perfectly encapsulates Capra's views of small town values stacked against big city selfishness.The screenplay is written by Robert Riskin,based on a story by Clarence Budington,photography by Joseph Walker and stars Gary Cooper,Jean Arthur,George Bancroft and H.B Warner.Kindhearted,tuba playing poet,Longfellow Deeds(Gary Cooper)lives a happy life in Vermont,until his life changes dramatically following the death of his wealthy uncle who leaves him a multmillionaire.The slick New York lawyers soon swarm around him like flies,advising him how best to run his uncles estate,and are bemused at his sheer lack of interest in his new found wealth and status.Longfellow informs them that he intends to give his wealth away(as he has no need of it but the poor and needy do)so the lawyers take him to court claiming he must be insane.Longfellow finds salvation in the form of wisecracking newspaper reporter,Babe Bennett(Jean Arthur)who was responsible for writing a series of scathing reviews concerning Longfellows naive and honest actions since coming to New York.To get information about how he spends his time etc she posed as an out of work gal,who he takes pity on and falls in love with.Devastated when the truth is revealed to him he wants nothing more to do with her.However out of love for him(and it has to be said swayed by his idealism)Babe attempts to change the courts decision from insane to sane.Cooper and Arthur are magical together there's a poignant,gentle chemistry between them that suits their characters situation perfectly.Performance wise Cooper is especially memorable as a gentle soul who believes you should always think of others before yourself.Although peddling a powerful message Mr Deeds still finds time for lots of laughs.Memorable scenes include Deeds feeding donuts to horses,his fascination with firetrucks and locking his bodyguards in a closet so he can go out alone and unrestricted.Funny and touching with a message at it's heart that has even more relevance in todays me me me,now,now culture.Mr.Deeds Goes To Town is up there with Mr.Smith Goes To Washington(a film with a similar set up and main character)as one of Capra's best films,it's well worth seeking this out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic comedy deftly masques Capra's muted socialism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the Depression still in full swing Frank Capra's makes a plea for the little man in Mr. Deeds Comes to Town. Capra takes liberal swipes at reporters, lawyers, judges, psychiatrists, poets and opera with comic relish and serious undertone while balancing an engaging romance between leads Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur.Longfellow Deeds (Cooper) , a tuba playing rube from Mandrake, Ohio inherits millions from his New York City uncle. Though somewhat overwhelmed by the big city he does not suffer fools gladly and in short order puts an uppity crowd of parasites in their place. They in turn try to have him declared insane using as evidence the undercover reporting of Babe Bennett (Arthur) who nicknames him for the tabloids The Cinderella Man.Capra makes no bones about who the villains are in Deed's - the well heeled, fully employed establishment. Douglas Dumbrille's estate lawyer leads the charge with magnificent venality and diabolical drive to gain control of the cash flow. Streetwise Babe exploits Longfellow in other ways before succumbing to his charm with Arthur doing a wonderful melancholy transition from self satisfied to self loathing. Cooper in one of the finest roles of his career play's Deeds with humble nobility saving his best for last in the mental competency hearing. Like most of Capra in his prime Deed's is infused with it's fare share of sentimentality, allowing him to take the edge off of Deed's anti capitalist plan to form small ten acre collectives from divided larger spreads he owns for the destitute little guy. It may smack of socialism but it is a far cry from anarchy when espoused by an American ideal loving Deed's played by an American icon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Deeds steps up for the little guy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Deeds Goes To Town is a movie of the Great Depression that entertains with a great story and acting. It also exalts human over material values and shows us one of the great icons of 20th century cinema. Gary Cooper's performance must be one that defined him as the strong, silent type who has that rare quality of common sense. When suddenly left with an unexpected inheritance from a wealthy uncle, the small town man from Vermont travels to New York to take over his financial empire. I enjoyed his laid-back style of sliding down banisters and making merry with the staff in his mansion or lecturing the board of directors of an opera company to make money, not look for handouts. Then there were those woeful expressions on his face as he endured the barrage of evidence in court that he was mentally incompetent. Unfortunately Mr. Deeds had an annoying habit of delivering a solid punch to the jaw of anyone who hurts his feelings, much to the despair of his public relations handlers but to the delight of the viewers. Jean Arthur was also outstanding in her role as the newspaper columnist who tricked him into thinking she was one of the downtrodden in order to obtain inside gossip for her newspaper; then, witnessing his integrity, she fell madly in love with him. The main cast was ably supported by Lionel Stander and Douglas Dumbrille as "bad guys" who were out to take advantage of Mr. Deeds. There are some great character actors like Walter Brennan and Spring Byington, screen icons who starred in the early years of television. Director Frank Capra has left a body of work in praise of the "common man" who does uncommon things, the salt of the earth characters he saw as the backbone of America. This is certainly what happens when Longfellow decides to help the desperate farmers of America. This movie is part of that legacy. In a world of pretension, Longfellow Deeds is a breath of fresh air, only most people don't realize that such a man can exist in the hardscrabble world of the 1930's, unless they are incredibly naive or certifiably insane. This is a movie that won't leave you disappointed and also give you a lot of respect for the great acting talents of the 1930's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very nice morality tale from Frank Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having being really delighted by It's a Wonderful Life and It Happened One Night, I checked out Mr Deeds Goes to Town having a strong inkling it was going to be good. And I genuinely liked it. The climax mayn't be truly convincing, and one or two parts of the story ring false, but this film is still a very nice morality tale from a very talented director.It is beautifully filmed, with lovely cinematography, scenery and sets, and the score is marvellous. Add a witty script, some very funny situations, an in general well constructed story if somewhat slight and clever direction and you have a good film in the making. Acting wise, Gary Cooper is wonderful as Longfellow Deeds, the tuba-playing "Cinderella Man" who inherits a small fortune, and Jean Arthur is a good and alluring match for him. And they are supported by less significant but solid supporting turns, especially Walter Catlett as the drunken poet.Overall, very nice if not quite perfect film from Frank Capra, that is much better than a well intentioned but unnecessary remake with Adam Sandler. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great drama comedy with a good message!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing why I watch old comedy films is that they can't make comedies like these anymore. It's hard to find an explanation for that, but maybe the answer is simpler than we think. All the good directors have passed away, and all the new directors just want to make money with their expensive stupid comedies. Try to find an American comedy from the 21st century with an actual message and prove me wrong. There of course are several great artists in the film industry today as well, but I'm talking about Hollywood comedy. It's so horrible that it cannot be watched.The plot builds around a simple, naive man; Longfellow Deeds who suddenly gets 20 million dollars, because his relative dies. This is the beginning of an unforgettable story of Mr. Deeds. A movie you will remember for ages.Frank Capra brilliantly shows the weirdness of an American town, when the simple-hearted man meets the mean men of New York. After all the people called the man crazy and stupid he suddenly starts to seem brighter than the others. "Why are people so mean to each others?" "Why would I help a man who's just tired of rowing, instead of helping a man who is drowning?" In this society time is money and money is more important than anything. To me that was one of the themes of this movie. You can't just name one message that it's trying to say, but I think Capra wanted people to broaden their horizons.Even if you let alone the great message, you'll find this film incredibly funny. They can't make films like these anymore. Gary Cooper gives a great performance as the sympathetic Mr. Deeds, as does Jean Arthur as Babe Bennet.Even that this movie was made over 70 years ago I found it pretty current. I highly recommend you to watch this and I hope you'll enjoy it at least as much as I did.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Capra "feel-good" classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about Christmas and Capra... while, unlike "Meet John Doe" or more overtly "It's A Wonderful Life", "Mr Deeds Goes To Town" has no immediate tie-in to the Christmas period, its ideas of universality, common decency and the brotherhood of man, particularly towards the deprived in society will always chime in with the season of good will, the time when I've just watched it.For me, the quality of Capra's work from 1934 "It Happened One Night" right through until "It's A Wonderful Life" in 1946 is almost unparallelled in the annals of Hollywood. Hitchcock hit a rich vein in the 50's and Preston Sturges in the early 40's but in combination with his house-writer Robert Ruskin and his own favoured company of technicians and actors, nobody surely dispensed movie-magic better than Capra.The first in the great triumvirate of socio-political commentary movies encompassing also "Mr Smith Goes To Washington" and "Meet John Doe", "Deeds" at first deceptively seems to be the lighter in touch of the three. Look deeper though and the same themes of universal brotherhood, railing against corruption and the celebration of the underdog are there although couched with more humour in the background. Its sympathy with the dispossessed working farmers must have had particular relevance to viewers of the time coming out as it did in the midst of The Great Depression, but as ever, Capra, masterfully sidesteps the obvious pitfalls of over-sentimentality with this sparkling mixture of pathos and humour, topped off with an uplifting message of nothing less than love thy neighbour and do unto others...It always helps when you've got big stars doing good jobs in the leads and Cooper and Arthur are superb in their roles. As ever with Capra, the supporting parts are beautifully filled, particularly Lionel Stander as Deeds' initially cynical chaperone won over by his charge's wholly natural common sense and straightforwardness, and the two Statler &amp; Waldorf-type sisters from Deeds' home-town, ill-advisedly wheeled out as prosecution witnesses, in scene-stealing vignettes.Of course, the pivotal case brought against Deeds is so ridiculous that it was bound to get thrown out and at times, perhaps, Deeds' childishness does slightly jar against his later principled stand against his would-be over-throwers. In the end though, Capra plays out his updated Christ and the Money-lenders parable to brilliant comic effect, allowing both we the audience and a silently glum Cooper to wait and wait and wait before he takes up the cudgels and wins the day (and of course the heart of Jean Arthur in the process).A simply marvellous, timeless movie from Hollywood's Golden Age with a recurring message that will not go way and will always have relevance in modern society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" is the sort of film that makes people say things like "They sure don't make 'em like they used to". Capra's trademark style is evident here as he unfolds a story of a simple country boy who inherits a fortune along with all of the complications that go along with it.Gary Cooper plays the titular Mr. Deeds and does a fine job of bringing a sense of innocence &amp; warmth to the character. Leading lady Jean Arthur makes a good match as she progresses from opportunistic reporter to Deeds' love interest. Meanwhile, the supporting cast is peopled with interesting characters played by the likes of Lionel Stander, Douglass Drumbrille &amp; H.B. Warner.Capra's direction was rewarded with an Oscar, the film's only win out of five nominations (including Best Picture). While the humour is somewhat subdued for current tastes the film retains a certain sense of charm. More importantly, the film serves as a fine exemplar of the style that earned Capra his own adjective (Capraesque).While I enjoyed the 2002 remake "Mr. Deeds" I find that the original is a more polished and mature effort. Also, being my first Capra film, I find that it makes for a good introduction to the man's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story of Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper) who is living a small quiet life in a small quiet town, where he composes greeting cards and plays the Tuba in the town band, that is until he inherits a huge fortune and his swept off to New York City. Once in New York, Longfellow finds himself out of his element when has to contend with both the big city as well as the lawyers seeking control of his inheritance. He meets someone, Babe Bennett (Jean Arthur) who attracts his interest and restores his faith about people in the big city, but unbeknownst to him she is actually a reporter looking for a story.The film nicely contrasts the values of small town life and the rat race of the big city, and also Longfellow's new found fortune with the crushing poverty of the depression.In the role of Longfellow Deeds, Gary Cooper is very endearing and effective, the film also has a wonderful supporting cast and an iconic performance by the wonderful Jean Arthur as Babe Bennett.This wouldn't rank as my favorite picture by Director Frank Capra (It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) but it is still very entertaining.The film was remade as the Adam Sandler vehicle Mr. Deeds in 2002, where as its only redeeming factor was Winona Ryder in the Babe Bennett she sadly doesn't hold a candle to Jean Arthur's iconic performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Country boy inherits $20 million and comes to big city: pixilation follows him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gary Cooper has the title role in "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," another wonderful film from Frank Capra that also stars Jean Arthur, Lionel Stander and George Bancroft. Deeds is a country tuba player who inherits $20 million from a relative on his mother's side and comes to New York to claim his inheritance. Everybody takes him for an idiot, including, at first, the newspaperwoman who wants a story on him, Louise "Babe" Bennett (Arthur). But they soon learn that Mr. Deeds is the real deal - and he has definite ideas about how he wants to spend his money. Along the way, Louise falls for him.Gary Cooper is marvelous as Longfellow Deeds, who sees through all the phonies he meets and is quick to pick up on those who need help. Cooper's smile could have melted the North Pole before it started melting. He smiles when he looks at Louise, but the rest of the time, he's worried about what's going on back home, trying to choose a replacement tuba player, and what is the best thing he can do with his money. Handsome, fair-minded, stubborn, Cooper's Mr. Deeds is a man of plain good sense and intelligence who isn't going to be pushed around.Jean Arthur does a beautiful job as Louise, at first thinking Deeds a real hick and slowly realizing that he's just a real human being - and she hasn't been around many lately. His hurt over the term the paper uses - Cinderella Man - actually coined by Louise as well as other stories about him begin to make Louise feel guilty. Finally, she has to fight for him. Arthur handles all of these emotions - the lightness, the confusion, the strong emotions - with ease.Though "Mr. Deeds goes to Town" follows a Capra formula - bumpkin versus the powerful, bumpkin and streetwise woman - he's such an excellent filmmaker, with an art of casting and pacing a film just right - that somehow, Capra's stories always seem fresh and inspirational. This film is no exception.As for Deeds being pixilated - well, you'll just have to watch the movie.</fullReview>

He tries to dole out the money to the countless unemployed unfortunates and becomes the target of an attempt by wealthy conservatives to be committed in an asylum for irrational behavior and even undermining the nation's social and economic fabric, much like conservatives pointed the finger at Roosevelt's New Deal. Gary Cooper gives an edgy portrayal of a guy shunning riches in the face of a disbelieving country and a media blitz, at the forefront of which is beautiful Jean Arthur, trying to find ways to knock down his credibility. She's especially beautiful in some of the soft focus scenes, and Cooper shoots down the greedy hypocrites in a funny and endearing courtroom battle for his freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'll go ahead and admit it, I used to have a soft spot for Adam Sandler's remake in 2002. It was amusing at the time and an introduction to a few good things like Steve Buscemi and John Turturro. I didn't realize how close it was to Frank Capra's original, nearly 70 years earlier, in all the near trivial detail. It's A Wonderful Life is enough for me to call myself a Capra fan, and his sense of feel-good storytelling is ideal for this timeless small town boy in the big city story. While Mr. Deeds Goes To Town does still have its dated parts, particularly in the camera choices, stage like sets and strange reactions (either under reactions or over reactions), the great script ties it all together. Gary Cooper can be more stoic than his role requires but his chemistry with Jean Arthur makes it all worth it. But what makes the film truly interesting is the final points on mental illness and the reaction to carelessly throwing the labels around. Now it appears to be the fashion, it's interesting to see this debated nearly 80 years ago. And its final points on what people do when they think makes the film all the more human and all the more timeless.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small town vs. the big city</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, the main theme of this film seems not so much to be upper class vs. lower class, of rich vs. poor, but of the town vs. the city, of rural values vs. urban values. This is reflected in the very title; "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" and, as he says, finds a jungle of magnificent buildings filled with people lacking any real nobility. This is a time honored theme in films of the 1920s and 30s, seen anywhere from silent films like "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans" (1927), to Warner Bros pre-codes like "Big City Blues" (1932) and Will Rogers vehicles like "State Fair" (1933). Gary Cooper is often cast as an archetype. Here, he is the archetypal small town American who is filled with common sense, basic decency and a sense of fair play. He goes to the city and is taken advantaged of and mocked by jaded urbanites. His values seem so completely foreign to them that they eventually question his sanity and put him on trial.Gary Cooper is great; the scene where Cooper discovers Arthur's deception is some of his best acting, completely naturalistic and real. Jean Arthur is amazing as well; the scene on the park bench with Cooper where she realizes Deeds has a lot in common with her own father and small town background is brilliantly played.Unlike city folk, Deeds will help a neighbor in need. Reflecting his small town values, his plan for Depression relief is to create jobs in agriculture, giving people the chance to be farmers. Deeds would have been better off trying to create industrial jobs. Unfortunately, there wasn't any way for people with small farms operating individually to make much money then or now; agriculture in America has been in a rut since the 1920s. Like many Capra films, "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" is a movie that looks backwards, not forward, expressing nostalgia for an America filled with small towns and prosperous farmers, an America that was gone forever in 1936 thanks to the influence of technology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Capra takes Mr. Deeds to the Bank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Millionaire "Martin W. Semple" is in a car that inexplicably speeds wildly off the road, and over a cliff. Definitely DEAD, he leaves his $20,000,000 fortune to handsome tuba-playing nephew Gary Cooper (as Longfellow Deeds). Since Mr. Cooper comes from the small Vermont town of Mandrake Falls, his uncle's crooked New York City handlers mistake him for a fool. They try to take advantage of Cooper, and gain control of his millions. Other relatives are also interested in the money. Meanwhile, pretty reporter Jean Arthur (as Louise "Babe" Bennett) goes undercover (as "Mary Dawson") to report on Cooper? Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" was one of the "Best Pictures" of 1936, winning that title from both the "National Board of Review" and "New York Film Critics", and securing Mr. Capra his second "Best Director" Oscar. It is also a triumph for writer Robert Riskin and Cooper, who might have won a "Best Actor" award had Paul Muni's "The Story of Louis Pasteur" (1935) not been considered a 1936 film.Cooper's doodling, banister-sliding "Deeds" is finely tuned, considering the schizophrenic changes his character goes through; his early simpleton to shrewd is the film's shark-jumping moment, discounting the heavy-handed opening wreck. Common sense IS business acumen. What happened to the man who immediately saw through wicked city folk could possibly be attributed to love (enter Jean Arthur). Presumably, there were no decent pretty women in Mandrake Falls. Reflecting on his small-town past, Copper tells Arthur, "It sounds kinda silly, but we had a lot of fun doing it." That also describes the film.In hindsight, Ms. Arthur looks "Best Actress" worthy. The supporting cast is also excellent, from gravel-voiced Lionel Stander (as Cornelius Cobb) and punch-taking Douglass Dumbrille (as John Cedar) to pixilated sisters Margaret Seddon and Margaret McWade (watch for them, later on, to rock the court as character witnesses). Many small pieces give this film enough energy to overcome its nonsensical storyline.******** Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (4/12/36) Frank Capra ~ Gary Cooper, Jean Arthur, Lionel Stander, Douglass Dumbrille</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a tendency amongst some to think that all the art produced by a great artist is great. This is false, but it gives cover for bad critics who just recycle old blurbs and tendencies about the artist. Think of the unthinking and fawning that goes on in discussions of Shakespeare. Yes, he was a great writer, but all but a dozen or so of his sonnets were mediocre tongue-twisters, and two thirds of his thirty-seven known plays were mediocre to terrible, so by being uncritical one actually diminishes the great art produced, for an uncritical stance makes it seem as if the touching of greatness is a product alien to all but the blessed. In short, it negates the hard work that all great endeavors require.This thought was ubiquitous as I watched the 1936 black and white Frank Capra classic film Mr. Deeds Goes To Washington. The film was adapted from a story, Opera Hat, by Clarence Budington Kelland, by longtime Capra collaborator, and dialogue expert, Robert Riskin. It's a good film, to be sure, as all Capra fare is, but it's not in a league with It's A Wonderful Life, nor even his earlier Oscar-winning classic, It Happened One Night. It lacks the overall depth of the former- and is far more preachy, and, in comparison to the latter, it lacks the quick pacing and tart-tongued dialogue, as it clocks in at 115 minutes in length.This film was, in many ways, a precursor to the later Capra-Cooper film, Meet John Doe, as both films feature rags to riches tales in which men are manipulated by the women they love. This film, however, is not as bleak as the later film. Yet, despite the use of many familiar tropes, what sets Capra apart from lesser directors are his believable lesser characters- all of whom get moments to shine, as well as the peerless dialogue. Add to that Capra's relentless glare at his leading actors' characterizations, and his films- which with lesser directors would have truly been the cornfests his worst critics claim, are ones always presented with a grittiness that could be from later films noir, in the midst of the feelgoodery?. All in all, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town is Capra in fine form, if not at the top of his game. Yet, if it's true that not all the art produced by a great artist is great, the opposite sentiment has merit: even the lesser art from great artists is better than that produced by lesser artists. This film is proof of that claim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra's version of Pilate's Interogation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think when Capra did this movie he had Matt 27:12 in his head ("And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing."). That has got to be one of the reasons most folks find the drama and the tension so compelling as Capra lets "Christ" defend himself in this version.Funny, it reminds me of reading "One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest" in college and the professor saying that many scholars found McMurphy portraying a Christ image. Blew my mind. I never saw that in the book.But the concept opened my eyes to looking for Christian themes in popular movies and books. Spider Man I is filled with New Testament themes (especially Revelation). My guess is that it isn't popular to draw these sort of conclusions as it was when Kesey wrote Nest back in'62, but it would be fun if one of the pointey heads university types would take it on. I mean in many ways that is what movies are all about, they say something about us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest directors in American film history is Frank Capra. He has produced 'Mr. Smith goes to Washington D.C(1939)' and 'Mr. Deeds goes to town(1936)'. One of the indiscriminating factors of these two movies is Jean Arthur's performance(Lovely Jean Arthur. Her characters reminds me 1930's ambitious career woman) Go back to the movie, Mr. Longfellow Deeds, naturally kind, pure and good. When he heard about his dead rich uncle who gave him $20 million(2005 standard : $1.286 billion-using nominal GDP), he was never surprised at that good news, he acted like Buddha or Jesus Christ. He utilized his money for others like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and George Soros.In contrast, we can see lots of greedy people in movies. Jean Arthur was no exception. She exploited him for her own promotion and paid holiday. When Gary Cooper, however, gave her a poem what he wrote for her, that bloodless blonde news reporter began to regret her mean behavior, fall in love with him and proceed to speak on his behalf at the court for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN is just one of those films you can't help loving. You'd think the basic plot for be corny as hell (A sweet, slightly dumb country bumpkin, played by Gary Cooper, inherits $ 20 million dollars, moves into the big city, the vultures circle in, and chaos erupts.) But Cooper and his supporting players (a very cute Jean Arthur, heartwarmingly tough George Bancroft, hard as nails Douglas Dumbrille, Joe Sawyer, Charles Lane, etc. etc.) keep the film going at a rapid clip. They are under the direction of the great Frank Capra. (Note: Capra was very nervous on how to top, or even equal his 1934 Oscar sweeper IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, almost so much he wanted to take a long vacation from filmmaking. We are very glad he didn't)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes it all comes together, writer, director, cast, and this is as good an example as most. It's a while since I saw it on television - I wasn't even around when it was released - and remembered it as being not bad, I'd also read quite a bit about 'Capracorn', which appeared to be an excess of sentimentality cocooned in pure schmaltz, so when I found it on the shelves of my library I wasn't expecting too much. I was mistaken. I was totally engaged by its blend of cynicism and charm, by the performance of Gary Cooper, who I can take or leave, and especially by Jean Arthur, with whom it's relatively easy to fall in love. There was excellent support all round and the current economic situation even makes it relevant. Truly a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Gary Cooper plays Mr. Deeds, a man from a small town who lands $20 million and decides to give it away to those who need it. I don't think this is a flawless film like a lot of the reviews say but it's pretty damn close. After watching the film I learned that Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was originally meant to be a sequel to this film but when the studio couldn't get Cooper they just made a separate movie. The two films have a lot in common and I think that 1939 film is a better version of this film, which has a few minor flaws but there's no denying that this movie has a lot of power behind it. The story of a simple man trying to do good is something Capra would do quite often and to be fair, his takes on the rich and life in general were nothing new as Griffith had been doing this type of film twenty-five years earlier. What does work is Capra's way of telling a story and the fine performances from the cast. Cooper is very good in his role but in my opinion it's Jean Arthur who steals the show as the reporter who sets out to make Deeds look like a fool but then falls in love with him. I think she gives a lot of power to the film as does Douglass Dumbrille as the lawyer. George Bancroft and Lionel Stander add a lot of nice support as well. The final courtroom scene is certainly over the top and something out of a fantasy world but it packs a great punch and makes for some great excitement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uplifting, though wildly unrealistic Capra gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Capra's most uplifting and exciting films, and also one of his most morally ambiguous. Similar in many ways to his 1939 feature, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". Both films deal with a hokey, innocent, childlike loner who ends up fighting for his ideas, opposing the cynical, greedy, and corrupt legion of people who are out to get him, trying to keep himself from looking goofy in newspaper headlines, and falling in love with Jean Arthur, who undergoes a change in morality and decides to aid the naive protagonist in his battle.A major difference between these two films, however, is the protagonists. Longfellow Deeds is quite a flawed human being; a simpleton who feels it necessary to attack anyone who makes him angry. Although Jefferson Smith had a similar problem, it wasn't quite as serious as that of Deeds, who literally punches someone in the middle of a courtroom session. The courtroom scene towards the end of the film, in which the government questions Deeds' sanity, is undeniably entertaining and humorous, but also completely unrealistic. It's quite obvious that a judge wouldn't grant Deeds time to deliver a preachy sermon to the people in attendance (as well as repeatedly insulting a doctor's doodling), much less become enlightened by it. And, of course, the scene with Mr. Deeds punching a man in court, claiming that "there's just one more thing I wanted to get off my chest" is simply laughable.It's a film full of stereotypes and goofy plot twists, but it does have some great acting. Until seeing this film, I didn't realize that Gary Cooper could truly act. I'd seen him in more stoic, deadpan roles in such movies as "Morocco" and "High Noon", but never as a loony, conflicted victim like Mr. Deeds. Jean Arthur is outstanding as usual. There is an impressive supporting cast as well.What ultimately makes "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" a great film rather than a good one is Capra's morality battle, which doesn't seem to include the physically aggressive actions and short tempers of his protagonists. Longfellow's total lack of desire for money is quite inspiring, and his willingness to give it away to those who truly need it is even more so. We could use more people like Longfellow Deeds, Jefferson Smith, and George Bailey in our corrupt, greedy world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra corn at its sweetest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's not give all the credit to Capra. Let's point out that a movie is a collective creation involving directors, writers, cameramen, editors, actors, musicians. And when everything works, as in this movie, it's a miracle, isn't it? How can so many things coalesce? Lionel Stander stands out as a frog with a heart of gold. And where and when did Gary Cooper learn to act so well? One is impressed with all the good acting in this movie, even character parts. Those non-pixilated old ladies are adorable. That stern psychiatrist spouting banalities and doodles. There are too many interesting characters to count. That's what movie making is all about. It's good that the movie is on DVD, but a movie like this must be seen in the theater, together with other people. I find it very sad that the new generations don't get a chance to experience old movies collectively. We humans have a need for collective experiences. What I didn't like about the movie was the "socking", which at the time was cute, one wonders why. It is transparently there to prove to us that Longfellow with all his poetry and music and no girl is no sissy.This must be the best Capra movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if Longfellow Deeds and Howard Roark were stuck in an elevator?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's curious that Gary Cooper played both Longfellow Deeds, who in "Mr. Deeds goes to Town", (1936), decides to give away all his money to the poor to give them a new chance at success and happiness, and Howard Roark, in "The Fountainhead", (1949), who fights the ignorant masses to fulfill his own destiny. The first is classic Cooper, a warmhearted, basic guy whose major trait is that he enjoys life and loves people. The second is basic Rand, in which he and everyone else give stilted speeches decrying the mediocrity of the common man and extolling selfishness as a virtue. This performance is best described below, where one poster compares it to the forced confession of a downed pilot. As a movie the whole thing resembles one of those wartime propaganda pieces extended to feature length and is basically unwatchable, the career nadir for everyone in it. Points are best made in the cinema by telling the story and allowing the audience to form the conclusions, not by telling them what they are supposed to think. Is it any wonder that, in the final shot, Cooper looks like he's ready to jump? It is impossible to discuss "The Fountainhead" without discussing the ideas behind it. it is. however, best to be brief, (which the film is not). let me just make the following points: It is certainly true that the measure of society is the extent to which it's most intelligent and talented people are allowed to develop and use their abilities. When their dreams get realized, dreams the rest of us did even know we had get fulfilled as well. But somebody has to build the buildings, the cars, the TV sets and computers the geniuses come up with. it's also a measure of society to see the extent to which it allows all of it's citizens to be productive through education, rehabilitation and opportunity. The true conservative ideal is not selfishness but self-reliance. There is all the difference. The right wing in this country has adapted Ayn Rand as their literary saint but in fact they spend most of their time trying to make sure the rich remain rich, buying up patents, crushing competition and opposing movements that seek to empower people. They resemble not Roark but the people opposing him, who by the way are not the "ignorant masses" but the powers that be.  In answer to the title question, I think that if Howard Roark and Longfellow Deeds were stuck in an elevator, the result would be a blueprint for an elevator that held everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rich vs. poor...more Capra-corn in the same thread as other Capra movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a reason why so much of the material in MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN seems like a retread of other Frank Capra movies. We have GARY COOPER in the role of a lovable "everyman" on the right side of justice being taken for a ride by less than honorable "thieves"; we have JEAN ARTHUR, at first only pretending to be on Cooper's side and betraying him by withholding her real identity until she comes clean for the rousing finale; and, of course, the black-hearted villain of the piece is DOUGLAS DUMBRILLE (instead of CLAUDE RAINS in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). And so, for a film that is a relic of the '30s screwball comedy, much will depend on whether you find the chemistry between Cooper and Arthur enough to sustain the somewhat hokey plot.GARY COOPER is at his most affable and charming in his role as Longfellow Deeds, naive and trusting until he finds himself caught up in a crusade against the bad guys and JEAN ARTHUR has played this role so often that she fits the part perfectly. But the sentiment is something Capra can never quite let go of (in all his films), and the silliness sometimes borders on the absurd.For fans of Cooper and Arthur, this is a "must see" comedy that is firmly planted in the '30s-era of film-making with its simplistic message of honesty vs. corporate greed. Cooper deserved his Oscar nomination but it's doubtful whether the film really deserved to be called the Best Picture of '36 by the Academy.Trivia note: Some of the best lines go to LIONEL STANDER as the "conscience" of the story and he delivers them with a sharp flair for comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar winning director Frank Capra (The Bitter Tea of General Yen, It Happened One Night, It's a Wonderful Life), I heard of this film because of the apparently rubbish Adam Sandler remake, and it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I decided to see what I'd think. Basically it the Great Depression, and wealthy business man Martin Semple has died, and the newspapers are speculating and searching for the heir. The attorneys find the only living heir in the small town of Mandrake Falls, Vermont, the tube playing and quite simple minded Longfellow Deeds (Oscar nominated Gary Cooper). Longfellow agrees to accompany his business associates to New York City, but he to the lawyers are bemused to know that he doesn't really want $20,000,000. Wanting to cash in on these rumours, a greedy sensationalist daily newspaper sends the beautiful reporter Louise 'Babe' Bennett (Only Angels Have Wings' Jean Arthur) posing as a damsel in distress. As time goes by and Longfellow does spill his beans about things he could do with the money, Louise is slowly finding him really charming and may in fact be falling for her hot story victim. Longfellow eventually decides to give most of his money ($18,000,000) to many farm lands for homeless families, and two problems crop up when Louise reveals the truth about herself, and Longfellow faces court to determine his sanity. For the majority of the case Longfellow sits back and listens to what the people who know him have to say, but eventually he plucks up and has his say defending his sanity. Longfellow points out the little unseen mannerisms people use while concentration (e.g. twiddling fingers, scratching noses), and the judge concludes that he is sane as anyone else in the court room, and he and Louise walk out happily. Also starring George Bancroft as MacWade, Lionel Stander as Cornelius Cobb, Raymond Walburn as Walter, Walter Catlett as Morrow, Margarete Matzenauer as Madame Pomponi, Ruth Donnelly as Mabel Dawson and Muriel Evans as Theresa. Cooper is good at being eccentric, Arthur is quite pretty and sassy in ways, and there are some good giggly moments, but I think the best moments are those in the court room, but as a whole, a likable ordinary Joe classic comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing, Harmless Populist Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'll probably like this Frank Capra comedy if you haven't already seen it. Gary Cooper is Longfellow Deeds, a small-town writer of Hallmark doggerel who plays the trombone and is amiable and generous. He inherits 20 million dollars and goes to New York, where he is ridiculed and betrayed by Jean Arthur, an undercover reporter whose job is to make him look silly. When he discovers this, the disillusioned Cooper decides to give all his money away to poor farmers and return to Mandrake Falls. (This is 1936, near the depths of the Great Depression.) In order to stop him and get their own hands on the money, some of his relatives bring him to court to prove he's insane. Cooper remains silent for the first part of the trial and it looks bad for him until he decides to speak out and turn the table on the connivers. He gets the money and the girl.Gary Cooper is always good when he's being grilled on the witness stand. I haven't actually counted the number of times he's been falsely accused of one thing or another but in addition to this film, "The Fountainhead", "The Wreck of the Mary Deare," and "The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell" come to mind.This is the only movie in which he is grilled and the results are intentionally comic. All the others have some unintentional laughs. It's also the first of Capra's three "everyman" movies, in which an anonymous, simple soul is turned into a public celebrity and manipulated by some corrupt organization of powerful people. It's the least complicated of the three. Deeds is nothing more than a lucky guy. In "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," the story is didactic. In "Meet John Doe", the story becomes almost tragic. In none of them is the happy ending believable.Capra -- great name, by the way, "goat" in Italian -- seems to know exactly what he's doing here. The direction gets the job done with easy efficiency. And the performances are uniformly good. I had a bit of trouble with the scene in which a table of snooty famous poets invite Cooper over and then ridicule him because he only writes verse for greeting cards, if only because it's so difficult to imagine rich poets who were self-satisfied snobs in the mid-1930s, cruel to the honest working man. Who were they thinking of? Nobody, I'd guess. It's just a plot device.There aren't many belly laughs in "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town." The comedy seems at times a little dated and sometimes silly. When nobody is looking, Cooper slides down a banister and tickles the feet of the nearly naked statue at the bottom. Oh, he's pixillated alright. But it's heartwarming to see a naif overcoming his greedy persecutors and going about, doing good. It's almost more of a fairy tale than a comedy. Whatever amusement we find in it is more likely to elicit smiles than laughs. If that was the purpose of the film, it achieved its goals. People probably needed all the hope and all the optimism and momentary palliatives they could find in 1935 when the film was shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dress Rehearsal for "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny how common it was for directors in the 30s to remake their own movies, sometimes no more than a few years after they made the original."Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" isn't exactly a remake of "Mr. Deeds," but it sure bears more than a merely striking resemblance to Capra's earlier film. The idea of an idealistic everyman standing up to a bullying bureaucracy is central to both films, but "Mr. Smith" is the darker and more bitter of the two. As a result, "Mr. Deeds" is sunnier and more fun, but also feels less substantial.Nothing wrong with the actors though. Jean Arthur is one of my favorite actresses from this time period. She was cute and flirty, but never in a self-conscious or cloying way. And Gary Cooper, despite his towering presence and good looks, excels at playing an everyday Joe who doesn't want a life of complicated wealth thrust on him when a rich relative dies and leaves him his inheritance.Frank Capra wasn't a very versatile director, and he was rather obsessed with one theme that he revisited time and again, but what he chose to do he did very well.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gary Cooper in a fine old film that has relevance today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gary Cooper is Mr. Deeds, a simple man who likes simple things. And, by the way, one of the more sane people one could meet. When he becomes the surprise heir of a large fortune, it seems every unscrupulous person in and around his little community want a piece of him. Better yet, a piece of his fortune. This has relevance today, as we read repeatedly that one or the other new multi-millionaires from winning a big lottery payoff fall on hard times. The latest is the granddaughter of such a winner, she was given everything she wanted except responsibility, and she apparently died as a result.SPOILERS follow. The climax of the movie is the hearing where various greedy men are trying to have Deeds ruled incompetent, so that they can decide what to do with his fortune. One after another they describe the strange behavior of Deeds, and he simply sits there, refusing to enter the debate. Seems the biggest indicator of his mental state was that he wanted to divide up a large parcel of land, give a piece to each of 20 or 30 needy but deserving men, who would in turn farm the land and eventually take full ownership. Finally, he spoke up, explained his positions, all agreed that he was probably the most sane man in the room. Good role for Gary Cooper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Semple is killed in an auto accident and leaves $20 million to his nearest living relative, even though he can't be found by Semple's lawyer Cedar. Eventually, the heir is identified as Longfellow Deeds, a poet living in Mandrake Falls, Vermont. Cedar, seeing Deeds as a country bumpkin, plans to have Deeds give Cedar power of attorney, so that Cedar's firm can get ahold of Deeds' fortune and prevent the firm from being audited. Deeds however is not the hick Cedar thought he would be, so the swindle becomes complicated. Meanwhile New York Mail writer Babe Bennett writes a series of articles for her paper (portraying Deeds as an eccentric country boy living in New York with a fortune) while pretending to be his friend. Deeds, who never really wanted the Semple fortune, decides to give his money away to needy farmers, which makes Cedar now threaten to portray Deeds as out of his mind who should not have control of his fortune (which would then go to another Semple heir, working with Cedar's firm) and using much of Babe's articles as proof, which devastates Deeds. Very good film with great performances from Cooper and Arthur, with Capra giving us his usual dose of "Capracorn", but the film does reveal political biases here which may turn off some viewers and Deeds' character seems smart at times his character shouldn't but can't seem to notice the obvious exploitation by Cedar and Babe, but still a great script by Riskin, and a treat to watch. Rating, 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A snapshot . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>of how this powerful medium can be used as propaganda. It is that characteristic that makes this film important.The viewer that just wants to be entertained will be so.Things were rough in 1936. The modern escape mechanism was (and remains) to shift the vicissitudes of life into the realm of "The buck stops there". Easy targets, the capitalists. Especially when you get the emotions of a country to swing to the beat. Movies can facilitate that. Toss in the political opportunities and - voil? - you have a compliant herd.The substitution of Deeds for $$$ and his obligations regarding the same is unmistakable.I guess the most believable part was the portrayal of the press pretending to have some moral redeeming value. I'm afraid that ship has sailed.The film gets a 3 from me, if for no other reason than its self possessed prescience.A noteworthy and valuable film - even if I don't care for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trivia Note: For "Hart to Hart" fans, you might recognize the Actor playing Cob. He is a 27 year old actor here(he looks like he's in his 30's), who later when on to play Max in "Hart to Hart". (Easy to recognize especially by the "froggy" voice)This was a superb film, although some of the actions are a bit farcical. I enjoyed this more then Capra's "It's A Wonderful Life". This movie is better paced than that one. However, Stewart's character in the later film is more believable. The punching out of people by Cooper's character is not a proper response to someone "getting your goat". I can just see kids telling mom and dad, "But the hero did it in the movie."Other than this, the morality of the movie is excellent and is just as relevant now as it was then. We're spending billions to fight a war, or "maintain the peace" in a foreign country, while poverty affect millions of Americans on our own soil. However, we have "no money" to spare to give them additional aid. Community Colleges, the last bastion of the low to middle income people, are seeing fee increases which may cause many students to drop out or take longer to finish college.We need to distribute money to help those who want to help themselves, not give "free rides" to those who bilk the US government(which in turn is the taxpayers) by overcharging(e.g. in Iraq).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a few corrective comments, possible SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Longfellow Deeds is the nephew of Mr. Semple who died in a high speed auto crash in Europe. As his only known relative, he is the automatic heir to the Semple fortune. Deeds lives in the small Vermont town of Mandrake Falls. He composes verses for a greeting card company. He recites a limerick he's made up for Lionel Stander's character "Corny" Cobb: "There once was a man named Cobb, Kept Semple away from the mob. Came a turn of the tide And Semple, he died, Now poor Cobb is out of a job". Stander says, "This is the first time I've ever been fired with poetry!" Deeds plays a tuba for relaxation, a fact that figures in his subsequent sanity trial, a fact that sparks a hilariously comic sequence in the courtroom scene. His friendship/romance with the Jean Arthur character, an incognito reporter, inspires her to dub him "The Cinderella Man", as she covers his escapades on the town in New York. He is enthralled by the supposed fact that he has helped a "lady in distress" when she feigns a hunger fainting spell. His charm and naiveté are artfully juxtaposed against the crassness that was and is New York.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessential Capra Crap - Please End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins compellingly - wasting no time, the opening shot shows a car driving off a bridge and into a river. For me, this was the highlight of the movie, as Capra quickly kills all the suspense by immediately explaining exactly what the car crash was all about with his usual montage of dizzying newspapers piling up on the screen. Certainly this is not meant to be a suspense film, but it needn't go out of its way to kill all the suspense it has set up, either.It should be said that this film didn't stand much of a chance with me to begin with, what with the lead role being played by Gary Cooper - an actor who, to my mind, possesses all the rugged good looks of George Formby and all the dashing charm of Boris Karloff. Capra's usual ensemble of characters are all there - Cooper plays the all-American small town everyman hero, there is a mystifyingly odd performance from Jean Arthur as the pithy love interest, Douglas Dumbrille is the fuddy-duddy clueless old gentleman and the always awful Lionel Stander is the sort of character he always plays. All that's missing is a character called "Mr Peabody". I award points for at least not making Stander a henchman called "Louie". However, there is scarcely a character in the entire film that's not a cliché - from the board members of the opera foundation, to the judge in the courtroom scene; Capra even sinks so low as to use a bespectacled, bearded German psychiatrist. To be fair, these characters may not have looked as clichéd when the film first came out, but still the film looks like it was made with the same movie template kit that all Capra's films come from. And it's not just the characters - there's also the too-familiar-for-my-liking marching band/tickertape parade, and of course the rapturous feel-good climax. And while I'm at it, I've had it up to here with 30s comedies about newspaper reporters looking for scoops about socialite gossip. As soon as I realise it's another newspaper reporter plot, the film has lost me.Lack of originality aside, my main beef with this film is the major issue I have with most films - the plot is simply not compelling enough. It uses the same form of suspense that most of these meandering films use - the "what's going to happen next?" form. The story takes little twists and turns and little dramas pop up here and there and whenever they feel like it, but it's not tightly structured enough to be compelling. It's merely a series of events with no real driving force behind it; and the few unanswered questions likely to provide interest will be already answered in the minds of the viewers with knowledge of Capra's other equally predictable films.It took this film to finally convince me that Capra is in no higher a league than Howard Hawks, George Cukor et. al. - i.e. a mediocre stage director who must have come into the possession of some compromising photos of a movie studio chief.The montage of newspapers reappear several times throughout the film, interjecting to explain the bleeding obvious to the viewers, as though we need to be told that the trial is due to begin today because we can't deduce that from the fact that the scene is set in a courtroom. The courtroom scene, by the way, is nothing short of excruciating. I've never been one to value realism in films but there is a definite point beyond which I cannot suspend my disbelief. The threshold of disbelief is roughly about the point where you see a respectable, conservative looking and doubtless well-read court judge give credibility to an equally conservative in appearance team of lawyers, who are accusing Deeds of insanity based upon such clear acts of hysteria as feeding doughnuts to a horse and jumping aboard a moving fire engine. The fact that the judge allowed such preposterous charges to even be heard, let alone to conduct a full hearing and listen attentively to the evidence with a straight face, really made this scene unwatchably stupid. At any rate, ten minutes of ridiculous evidence and testimony "proving" Deed's insanity makes uninteresting viewing.For one brief moment at the end, I took leave of my senses and thought that the film was going to finish with a non-predictable conclusion. All loose threads of storyline had been tied up and the curtain was ready to fall ? I was about to award this film kudos for actually doing something different and out of tune with the Hollywood fairy-floss that makes up the rest of the story - then Capra spoils it all by tacking on a brief and unnecessary coda that makes it indistinguishable from every other bit of feel-good plop he ever excreted.To briefly give some credit where it's due, at least the Mr Deeds character was not entirely as wholesome as Mr Smith, making him not an exact carbon copy ? and I must confess that the first forty minutes of the film was mildly entertaining in its own way, although seldom funny. The less cynical viewers amongst us who don't notice every plot device, every stock character and every recycled storyline in a film like I do, may well be able to find some enjoyment in the rest of the film as well; though I struggle with the possibility of the courtroom scene being anything less than painful.If one thing can be said for Capra, he was many years ahead of his time - he paved the way for many of today's clueless directors with no concept of the art of cinema. I'd sooner watch a Hitchcock home movie of his grandchildren playing in a wading pool than this boring bulldust. Other than that, I absolutely loved it.</fullReview>
