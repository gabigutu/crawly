		<shortDescription>Sandler's lovable fool has a serious message while slipping on a banana skin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody goes to see an Adam Sandler movie for spiritual enrichment or intellectual stimulation - let's get that out of the way first. Once you accept you've paid your money to be mildly entertained in a lighthearted, slapstick manner, strap in and enjoy the ride. I keep hearing Sandler is a major Hollywood player these days with an equal footing as producer as he is actor (he has produced a considerable amount with fellow actor Rob Schneider - the similarly inane but funny - mostly in spite of yourself - Hot Chick being the most recent example, in which he has a cameo role and indeed, Schneider helps Sandler out in Mr Deeds) so it's hard to prove that Sandler is now typecast as a lovable fool, because it's fairly likely he chose the part himself, possibly aware that Hamlet might be a little out of his league. Sandler need only check his bank balance to see that the lovable fool is certainly a lucrative one, having made an absolute mint playing countless other characters blessed with naive charm and a heart of gold. The story - we all know it's a remake of the classic depression-era propaganda film starring Gary Cooper, designed to lift spirits and foster a sense of community - centres around a picturesque New England town and its perenially-cheerful, smalltown inhabitants, chiefly Longfellow Deeds (Sandler), who inherits a fortune from an uncle he never knew, finds himself at the helm of a media empire and heads to the Big Apple to find out more. Here Winona Ryder steps in as the ambitious TV reporter determined to get her big scoop and dupes the affable Deeds into falling in love with her. All the time she's wearing a wire and a hidden camera to enable their courtship and his antics, sometimes drunken, sometimes heroic, to be broadcast on the evening news. Typically Deeds is the last to know and is appalled when he makes the connection. By which time Ryder's character has fallen in love herself, resigned from her job and is begging for a second chance. Deeds' only flaw is a short fuse and this is at odds with his generous spirit, who at times could be George Bailey, James Stewart's kindly smalltown character in Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946), but this spices things up a little and allows the suspension of disbelief to continue a little longer. The number of disrespectful, foulmouthed city folk he takes out is entertaining, while not always convincing, but then times have changed and these days your average bloke doesn't think of taking a swing at a man for swearing in front of a lady (more's the pity I say). While you could aim criticism at this and jeer at the corny lines and simplistic moral at the film's end, there is something to be cherished here. The moral of course being that money is less important than being true to yourself, and while you're at it, be nice to your neighbour. As Mother Teresa once said, kindly words are heard once but their echoes are heard for ever - Deeds' character and his deeds (pun definitely intended) themselves are echoes of another, lamentably more innocent time and it's uplifting to see this spirit so laboured in the film's remake. It's also refreshing to see this bravely recreated by the producers, who have not shied away from dealing with the film's essence in these cynical times. It's not all sentimental Queen of Hearts stuff though. There are some hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments that counter the film's message perfectly - the helicopter ride to Manhattan where the crew and Deeds are singing 'A Space Oddity' complete with air-guitar springs to mind here - and there is the usual dose of slapstick you'd expect from a Sandler picture. The 7 flying cats rescued from a burning building by our hero is particularly memorable and as I say, I was laughing in spite of myself. This humour compliments the film's slushy message and prevents any actual retching in the theatre - leaving the cinemagoer shuffling out content, with a smile on his face - definitely a feelgood movie. I just hope Sandler doesn't attempt It's A Wonderful Life next, I don't think the world's quite ready yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Deeds, the remake of Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town is an old comedy that is personally one of my favorite comedies. It's just a wonderful film that I highly recommend you watch if you get the chance. So Adam Sandler decided to take on that classic and make it into his film, which honestly isn't that bad, just in comparison, believe me then you look at it as a horrendous film. It was just one of those movies that really didn't need a remake. But Adam Sandler did bring his own bite to the film and just updated the story for the younger generation that obviously never heard of the movie.After Preston Blake freezes to death at the summit of Mount Everest with a triumphant smile on his face, a search for his heir for his successful company begins. When it is found that he has a living nephew named Longfellow Deeds who runs a pizzeria in New Hampshire, Deeds is contacted and brought to New York City by attorney &amp; businessman Chuck Cedar. Plans are made for Deeds to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home $40 billion richer, but he must remain in New York for a few days as all the legal details are worked out. The story is major news, and reporter Babe Bennett, who works for a tabloid show, has a friend pretend to steal her purse in sight of Deeds, because their research indicated Deed wanted to meet a girl by saving her, the same way his father had met his mother. Deeds rescues her and she continues to go out with him under the disguise of Pam Dawson, school nurse. Though Pam initially hopes to just get a good story on the new heir, she eventually falls for the kind-hearted Deeds while realizing that all she's done is lie to him and wants to be with him. Chuck is also up to no good in wanting to take over the company from Deeds and doesn't have the best intentions.Mr. Deeds has a few funny moments, even though it was incredibly immature, I do have to admit that I got a kick out of the scene where Longfellow shows off his frostbite foot and tells the servant to hit it with the fire poker, and screams to freak him out, yeah, it's something that most little brothers would do to their older sibling, but it still got a laugh. Wynonia Rider was actually pretty good in the film, she was very adorable, but her chemistry wasn't exactly on key with Sandler, not her fault, just I wasn't feeling it too much in the film. Over all the film is worth the look if you see it on TV, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see the movie.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny But ..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, once again, has most of the earmarks of modern-day comedies: tons of sexual innuendos, lots of good laughs but many of them out of questionable lines or behavior, and a stupid, rushed ending that tries to make all the good guys win and the bad guys lose. The latter is fine - I want the good guys to prevail - but they way they go about it is stupid.I did think this movie had a little softer edge than most other blatantly-low class "Something About Mary/American Pie"-type comedies of today however. I guess what I am saying is this isn't as in-your-face type offensive most of the rest are.Of course, Adam Sandler is playing the low-key Gary Cooper role of Mr. Deeds from the 1940s, so he's not the high-strung Happy Gilmore type here, although he does get violent at times. Winona Ryder plays the love interest, a tabloid low-moral reporter who is reformed by the amiable Mr. Deeds. She's not believable at all and one can see one reason she isn't much of star actress anymore. It isn't just her real-life problems. She's pretty and she's okay in the role but something's missing in her acting.The real star of the film is John Turturro, as the Spanish butler. He's funny in about every scene he's in and he's a guy everyone roots for here.In summary, it's a pretty nice film, with a number of laugh-out-loud scenes, but it's still a long way from the Gary Cooper-Barabara Stanwyck classic film version, at least in terms of an aw-shucks wholesome hero. This film just doesn't have the heart and soul of the original, because it's more concerned with cheap laughs than a moral message. Still, it has its funny moments and I found worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead, probably. The movie is simply awful, diseased and ridden with more fleas than Hennie Youngman's long dead one-liner underpants. Al Sharpton is hilarious to laugh at, except at the mercy of these writers. HOW DO YOU MAKE AL SHARPTON UNFUNNY? John Turturro, John McEnroe, Steve Buscemi -- all talents (and funny!) drained by this vampiric script. Death reeks from every orifice here, from the greeting card "bits" (what else to call them?) to the hackneyed physical stuff. Thoughts:--what's with Sandler's dubbed voice over Murph? when will someone tell this idiot that he can't do "funny voices"? HE CAN'T EVEN MANAGE HIS OWN RIDICULOUS VOICE.--get 40 billion dollars, toss $25k at a random couple in a restaurant, $40k for used bikes, rent MSG for a night: the writers didn't even bother to stop drinking long enough to come up with ONE cool thing to do with a massive fortune. HOW DO YOU MAKE BREWSTERS MILLIONS LOOK LIKE CINEMATIC GENIUS?--since when does nice mean RETARDED?--if smalltownville is so great, why's it full of psychos, dullards and freaks of nature?

Hmmmm. much like Sandler, has been delivering the same performance again and again since onset of career--trying to show off how much you researched the bumblefunk towns of the northeast? WICKED lame.--Stephen King is scary jokes?--how tiny do you have to be down under to make yourself into a phony physical tough guy in every movie? i mean, does anyone actually believe that sandler can "beat the crap" out of anyone else?--on what network do you find a moustachioed limeystralian foreigner hosting an American television show?--sandler and romance::pasta and nuclear chunks. it's (unintentionally) funny that the premise also includes the phony "sandler could get someone if he didn't have money subplot"...can this guy even get dates as a movie star?

He has to adjust to life in a Palatial Mansion with a personal butler, and he meets a beautiful school nurse (Winona Ryder); but its not long before the money begins to change everything, and he learns things are not what they seem.This remake is not without plenty of laughs, but it never quite manages to do anything thats truly hilarious or new. For a bit of fun its worth a watch, but it's one of those films that you will forget about pretty quickly.6/10 its just average i'm afraid</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best Sandler movie, but not the worst, either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Mr. Deeds was absolutely hilarious, when I was a kid. It was one of my favorite movies. Now that I'm older, and have a lot more experience with comedies, I have to admit that it's not quite as wonderful as I once thought it was. It's so-by- numbers and unimaginative, that I can't imagine much passion or effort was put into making it, at all. There are a few laughs to be had, but no more than any other typical Sandler movie. The story is shallow and the characters are so one-dimensional, that it's hard to really have much of an interest in what's going on. Somehow, it seems like not enough happens to even account for the relatively short running-time. I've simply grown-up, and besides how pretty Winona Ryder is, nothing about Mr. Deeds is as good as I remember.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, I recently took a chartered bus trip to Chicago and it was one of those buses that have TV monitors every five rows of seats. I'm one of those people who appreciates a comfortable ride in peace, perhaps chatting with a fellow passenger.So I had this drivel inflicted (and that's not too strong a word) on me. It was unfunny and being forced to at least listen to this rubbish sealed its fate in my book. An amazingly boring film from a production team that ought to know better.I refused to see this in theaters- and now I can say I wasn't wrong to avoid it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The All-Time Worst Re-Make of a Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Adam Sandler vehicle is a re-make of a classic Frank Capra movie which originally starred Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur. Capra won his second Academy Award for Best Director for the 1936 classic. Gary Cooper received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his sincere portrayal of a simple man thrust into extraordinary circumstances. As in many of Capra's films, Cooper's character, guided by a genuine moral center and sense of compassion for those struggling through difficult economic times (the Great Depression), fights against the shallow, the insincere, and the corrupt.This 2002 version of Mr. Deeds, directed by Steven Brill, possesses none of the charm or drama of the original. The task of updating Robert Riskin's and Clarence Kelland's Oscar-nominated script went to Timothy P. Herlihy, who received his professional break as a staff writer on "Saturday Night Live." The Oscar-winning Riskin also authored such acclaimed screenplays as "Lost Horizon," "It Happened One Night," "You Can't Take It With You," and "The Strange Love of Martha Ivers." In contrast, Herlihy has no non-Adam Sandler big-screen credits, having penned or co-authored the screenplays for "Billy Madison," "Happy Gilmour," "The Wedding Singer," "The Waterboy," "Little Nicky," and "Big Daddy." Herlihy's unfunny adaptation of the original script is therefore not surprising. Unfortunately, the direction, the script and Sandler's performance all make Longfellow Deeds' character look shallow and the character's transformation into compassionate philanthropist seems contrived. The result of this collaboration is a film which is fundamentally insincere and lacking any charm.Do yourself a favor, and rent the DVD of the original 1936 film, and you'll see why Frank Capra and Gary Cooper were, respectively, among the greatest American directors and actors of the 20th Century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I used to think this was the funniest movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie first came out, I was about 13 or 14 years old. I remember I couldn't stop laughing every time I watched it. I was literally obsessed with the movie. I would watch it through, then rewind the tape, and watch it again. I spent most of my winter vacation from school watching Mr. Deeds. I begged for the DVD for my birthday, and by the time I got the DVD, I was so sick of the movie that I never wanted to watch it again. I was just flipping through channels today and it was on Comedy Central, and I was trying to figure out what amazed me so much about this movie. It is corny, dull, and predictable. The whole love story that develops throughout the movie has no chemistry, and the actors cannot convince the audience that they really belong together.Despite all of the pitfalls of this film, I will admit that there are a few points that do always make me giggle a little (i.e. "This was my brother's room...my parents hated my brother."), so I guess that's a credit to the quality of some of the jokes.All in all, I would say this is a film worth watching at least once in your life, but I wouldn't recommend buying the DVD or paying for it in a theater.</fullReview>

Wynona Rider does worse than embarrass herself here. It's got to be the worst performance by a major actor I've EVER seen. Except maybe the squalid, vomit-inducing work of Steve Buscemi in...what movie...yep, that's right...MR. DEEDS. Adam Sandler is his usual unbearable self, and all the other fine character actors in the movie are thankfully forgettable (for their sakes.) And even John McEnroe is bad!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmm... it seems I've seen this movie already, not because its a remake of an old Frank Capra movie, but because it's basically the same old Adam Sandler schtick for 2 hours. The only difference is this time it isn't very funny. Basically, a variation on a Sandler plot- idiot savant gets filthy rich but maintains his goofy (and humorless) innocence. The Sandler persona wears thin about 5 minutes into the movie and basically that's it. You're stuck with a mediocre movie that a chimp could have produced. The one I truly feel sorry for is Winona- first her shoplifting debacle and now this. My Personal Opinion: Avoid this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is indeed a pleasure to watch Mr. Deeds, Sandler style; Turturro is magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) lives in the small town of Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire, where he runs the local pizza parlor. His real ambition, however, is to write verse for Hallmark's greeting cards. Yet, so far, every rhyme he has sent them has been rejected. That does not matter to the townies, who love hearing Deeds recite his poems at the restaurant. One day, a billionaire (Howard Keel) dies on top of Mount Everest. He leaves no will, making it necessary for his huge company to seek out any heirs. You guessed it, Deeds is a long-lost nephew who inherits a boatload of dough. The company manager, Chuck (Peter Gallagher) wants to give Deeds 42 billion to sell his stock shares back to him. Deeds agrees at first. But, once he gets to his uncle's posh Manhattan mansion where servant Emilio (John Turturro) waits on him hand and foot, Deeds has second thoughts. Not only that, but he meets a beautiful local lady named Pam (Winona Ryder) and he is enchanted by her. But, beware, Deeds. Pam is really a reporter named Babe who is out to get dirt on him. And, are there indeed secrets to uncover? Who will end up with the money? This is really a sunny film for a rainy day. It is lighthearted fun with an absolutely terrific cast. Sandler is quite funny, of course, but John Turturro steals every one of his scenes with a performance that should have garnered him an Oscar. It's THAT good, yes. Ryder, Steve Buscemi, Gallagher, and many others are true delights as well. Then, too, the film looks amazing, from the costumes to the sets and beyond. It appears that no expense was spared and the result is a lovely-to-look-at film, too. Finally, the script is imaginative and humorous, making the viewer chuckle and grin nonstop. Do you, indeed, want a film to vanquish the blues after a rough day? You could, truly, find no better remedy than this one.</fullReview>

Sandler plays Longfellow Deeds, a small town schnook who inherits an unbelievably large amount of money. He turns in another of his patented performance as the dim-witted loser. Anything resembling Gary Cooper's charm in the original role is purely by accident. Sadly, much better actors Peter Gallagher and Winona Ryder are caught in the Sandler vortex, delivering unsympathetic charactiures of jaded Gothamites.

		<fullReview>This is the movie that Adam Sandler did the worst(the ones that I seen) and I still liked this film enough to write a positive review. The story is a remake from the 1936 version with Gary Cooper. Sandler plays Longfellow Deeds, a nice person with many friends. His uncle dies and he leaves forty billion dollars to his nephew, Deeds. Deeds travels to New York City to sign some papers. While in New York, he meets this beautiful woman. Little does he know that she is a reporter, not a school nurse. The script/storyline/jokes are bearable, but are better with most Sandler movies. I laughed a few times during the movie. Adam Sandler did a great job acting. Winona Ryder is a bit shaky in this role. John Turturro is hilarious as the butler who just sneaks up on everyone. I also have to mention Steve Buscemi as Crazy Eyes. That is what you call good comedy(referring to Crazy Eyes). There are some great songs to listen in this film. Overall, this is a good film but Sandler has done better films. I rate this movie 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard about this movie I thought it was going to be one of those great movies that make you laugh like crazy. Of course I was wrong, this movie can make you laugh in some moments, but it's kinda of stupid.Well, were to begin, this movie is about a good guy that lives in a small town. This guy is loved by everyone because he always do good things for them, and of course, he is very funny with those poems (or at least in the movie because I didn't laughed).Now, if someone on your family died and he left you 40 billion dollars, how would you react? I would run like crazy, yell many things, be happy. In this movie, when those two guys told LongFellow about that he was distracted thinking if someone was police or not, that's scary stuff, no one could be distracted if he had 40 billion dollars.Then let's talk of how he spent the money, like an idiot, he bought two bicycles at 20 thousand dollars. Then in one scene in the restaurant he sees two guys having some dinner, and just because he is a good guy he gives them 20 thousand dollars.Then let's talk about our good friend LongFellow Deeds, a good friendly guy that can easily make friends, that can spend so much money in fool stuffs, that makes weird poems very fast, whatever.To be honest this movie sucks, even if I saw it on TV I want my hours back. And what about the ending, always the same thing, that the villain is about to win, immediately someone appears, tells something and the villain is beaten, then that Deeds gets at least a billion dollars and spends it on buying to everyone a red car.This movie receives a: 1/10 Because it sucks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mr. Deeds" tells of a wacky, naive small town guy, Mr. Deeds (Sandler), with little respect for fame or fortune who inherits $40 billion and has to deal with the responsibilities and media attention which accompanies his inheritance. Ryder plays a tv producer after the inheritance story who happens to fall in love with the Sandler character, something which pushes this flick from romantic-comedy into the realm of fantasy or sci-fi. In spite of its hard-to-swallow romantic side plot, the film offers nonstop in-your-face silliness and nonsense which should make it a fun watch for fans into Sandler's brand of deadpan kookie comedy. Non-Sandler fans can expect a lukewarm result. (C+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How they got THAT movie out of the beloved classic "Mr Deeds Goes to Town", I'll never know. The only similarity is in the name of the lead character.Everybody overacted their role, and acted as stupid as possible. There wasn't enough relationship development between Winona's character and Deeds. In the *real* Mr Deeds (goes to town), the reporter and Deeds actually do establish a relationship.Just rent or buy the real dvd to the classic movies. If you're not afraid of real movies that don't have sex, toilet jokes, animal abuse, then you'll love the real thing. This production of Mr. Deeds is a joke.Check under "Mr Deeds Goes to Town" in imdb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable in a good way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the outside MR. DEEDS looks like another predictable remake, with absolutely nothing new to offer. On the inside, you guessed right. It has next to no substance, no creativity, almost to the point where you can predict the entire fate of the movie a quarter of the way in. My best friend and I did so and were not surprised. But we did enjoy the movie. The characters are all a delight, in a childish way. And it did have its moments.Multi-millionaire tycoon dies, leaves his grand-nephew the fortune.Adam Sandler repeats many things that he did in other movies, with different characters, situations, etc. But for a remake, this is a fairly good one and a better outing for the star compared to LITTLE NICKY. The new version of SPACE ODDITY was cute, if not from left field. A good renter though it may not appeal to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick With Capra's Version Instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake to Frank Capra's 1936 masterpiece "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" lacks the charm, heart and intelligence of that production. The titled character (Adam Sandler) inherits an outrageous fortune from a relative he did not even know about and New York opportunists led by the sleazy Peter Gallagher try to take advantage of Sandler's kindness and generosity towards others. Naturally Sandler is much smarter than he first appears and proves to be an individual that can handle swindlers. However he does let his guard down around supposed school nurse Winona Ryder (in actuality a reporter for a tabloid) and that is when his big-city troubles start. "Mr. Deeds" is a watchable and somewhat entertaining film that works because of Sandler's screen persona. Sandler continues to raise films that are duds just because of his enormous talents. The same is true with this one. Watch for "Fargo" alums Steve Buscemi and Harve Presnell as well as a long cameo from ex-tennis superstar John McEnroe. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the worst movie ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but it felt like torture watching this thing. Now, I admit, I'm not a very big Sandler fan. Honestly, I don't know how he became the cash cow he is in Hollywood. But seeing him on talk shows and having been blown away by Punch Drunk Love, I tend to think there actually is something going on beneath the goofy, lovable frat-boy veneer. But good luck trying to find it in this movie.I don't want to get too critical here--the real reason I had to write this is that the person before me wrote six or seven paragraphs on this movie and I was dumbfounded--this movie isn't even worth that much effort. It is so poorly made, from the acting (Turturro an exception as always)to the flat, lifeless cinematography. I really hate the way both Steven Brill and Peter Segal shoot their movies--completely unimaginative and frustratingly boring.I'm sure they keep a fun and lively set going but come on, the images in front of me need some life too. This movie was at times painful to watch--as I do like Winona Ryder and most all the actors involved in this. But it almost seemed like stunt casting (let's get some great actors from independent movies [inexpensive] and give them nothing to do but act out poorly devised stereotypical roles that are supposed to hark back to Capra films)--none of the actors seemed comfortable, especially Winona... ugh...You have talent Adam, don't be afraid to loosen your creative control and get a decent writer and/or director every once in a while to remind folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler's downfall begins...... Mr. Deeds is one of those big misses on Sandler's career. His performance is dull and lifeless, and his character is so deadpan and boring that's it's really very hard to care much about him or really what happens with his character. Winona Ryder is alright as far as acting performance goes, but Adam and her have zero on screen chemistry, I mean seriously their relationship together is so unbelievable, awkward, and just doesn't work at all. Awkward actually describes many if not all scenes in mr deeds. The film is totally and utterly void of laughter, it's awkward, forced humor just doesn't do the job. Peter Gallagher is OK I guess, kinda a phoned in performance though. Well, I got zero laughs in this early 2000's Adam sandler flick. This movie gets a 3/10 on my scale, sorry Adam, but it just didn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget It's A Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sweet-natured, small-town guy (Adam Sandler) inherits a controlling stake in a media conglomerate and begins to do business his way.This film gets a bad rap because it is thought to be a bad remake. And sure, any time you compare an Adam Sandler movie to a Frank Capra classic, the Capra film is going to win. That is just common sense. But think of it not as a remake, but a new interpretation for a new audience. Some folks (myself included) may watch both movies, but some may only be interested in one or the other.For what this is, it is not bad. The more mature Sandler is great. The juvenile humor is toned down, all the way to it only having a PG-13 rating. We do see a man's bottom, but otherwise it is just clean, folksy humor. Winona Ryder does alright as the leading lady. She is not a strong actress, but that is probably not what was called for in this particular picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical past Adam Sandler film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Deeds is very similar to many other Adam Sandler films. The film follows a basic and predictable formula. Many of the comedian's reliable standards are in effect: abuse of old folks, crude humor, a Rob Schneider appearance, and mentally deficient sidekicks. Some of the stuff works, but there's not much room for originality. This movie even perpetuates Sandler's trend of playing guys who are unexpectedly good at dishing out beatings. Many have considered Mr. Deeds to be one of Adam Sandler's more underrated films, and in several ways it is. However the film is typical but entertaining in some areas. It is a decent comedy, and the humor is what one would expect from a Sandler film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Deeds Done Sandler Cheap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Deeds (2002): Dir: Steven Brill / Cast: Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder, Peter Gallagher, Jon Turturro, Allen Covert: Supposedly based on Mr. Deeds Goes to Town but Adam Sandler hardly fills Gary Cooper's shoes, and director Steven Brill is no Frank Capra either. Sandler plays Longfellow Deeds who inherits forty million dollars. Winona Ryder plays a struggling reporter sent to embarrass him while Peter Gallagher plays a tycoon trying to manipulate him into signing away the company. Lame story with Sandler basically playing the same obnoxious moron he is known to play. He starts out here as a pizza delivery guy before settling in a mansion. Then he is involved in lame subplots, one involving a lady in a burning house who will not leave until Deeds throws all of her cats out the window. Director Brill previously cast Sandler in the equally dreadful Little Nicky. Ryder as the biggest disappointment. It isn't difficult to predict her change of heart and unwillingness to sabotage Deeds. Gallagher is wasted as a rather standard villain. Jon Turturro has the one funny performance as a butler with a foot fetish. He appears periodically but becomes the one good plot turn. Allen Covert also appears as a reporter with more forced humour heaped upon juvenile material. Deeds orders him to beat his frost-bitten foot with a fireplace poker. The same should be done to the film. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I saw this film like 20 to 30 times. I realized that the only truly funny scene that got to me was when the guy gets whipped by his father after saying, "NO DADDY, NO!" I never laughed at the scene when the cats were in the burning building, I never laughed when Adam fell through the table, and I never laughed during the epic fight scene in the restaurant. I just don't care for this film at all. It's all about the stock market and honestly I have more fun in my own accounting class then I do watching this movie. Oddly, I thought Winona Ryder did OK with what she had to work with and she really captures the audience's attention. Adam Sandler did play a good role too but this film wasn't as funny as it was anticipated to be. I give it a 4 out of 10 because it was alright the way it was written, it's just there wasn't enough jokes, I thought. It was more serious in tone and I think that took away from having Adam Sandler in the film. Adam Sandler is usually pretty funny, but here he plays a character that seems like kind of a bore and it really is hard to make a character comedic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 2002 romantic comedy, featuring Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) is about a humble guy who doesn't care about money. However, when his rich family member dies, he inherits a very big fortune - inspiring him to do business his way.It all starts when Preston Blake, a very wealthy media figure, dies with no close family, such as a wife or a child, leaving Longfellow Deeds to inherit forty billion dollars. As Deeds sets to New York to claim his inheritance, Preston Blake's former business partners, Cecil Anderson (Erick Avari) and Chuck Cedar (Peter Gallagher) pretend to show him his way into New York city as they as they hatch a plan to try to scam him out of his inheritance.In the meantime, the producer of a local news station wants to get headlines on what Deeds plans to do with the money. So he comes up with the perfect plan:he will use the beautiful Babe Bennet (Winona Ryder) to seduce Deeds while she is "wired for sound". Her job is to convince Deeds that she is a small town girl just like him. Deeds quickly falls in love with her, while his affection is authentic; hers is not. He also acts antsy "to defend her with his fists", which gets him in trouble with the press.As Deeds becomes the laughing stock of New York thanks to Bennet's bogus stories, Cedar and Anderson think they have found a devious plan to swindle his money. In a dramatic conclusion, Babe Bennet realizes that she loves Deeds and confesses to him. Deeds interrupts a meeting, that is set to liquidate the company, by giving a hearty surprise speech.In a sudden turn of events, it comes to light that his servant, Emilio Lopez (John Turturro),was the originally intended heir to Preston Blake's fortune.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not watched any of the earlier incarnations, or read the short story. And yet I feel fairly confident in saying that this is not the best version of the idea. It's an old concept? as long as the two sizes(and the distinction between them) of communities have existed, they've been making fun of each other, thinking that they're smarter than the other, etc. And it should be easy enough to come up with good jokes and gags relating to that conflict. Not sure why this manages so few of them. Why Sandler? Am I the only one who doesn't think his typical role equals your average guy that every young male can relate to? Are we supposed to go around beating up everybody, particularly those who deserve it the least, in some cases causing permanent damage? Musta missed that class. He can act, and he does show it in this, occasionally. So can Rider. Ferrell is great, as usual. Most of the performances are. Except the kids, they are quite irritating(and in other news, Earth is actually round). The material is what you'd expect, so if you like Adam, you may enjoy it. Editing and cinematography are fine. So's pacing. The plot is OK, but there aren't really any surprises to be found. Perhaps there is a little heart to this, however, it seems phony. There is potentially disturbing "comical" violence in this, as well as mild to moderate language. The DVD holds an informative audio commentary with the director and the writer, three well-done featurettes, six greeting cards, a bunch of deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers and a music video. I recommend this to fans of those who made it. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler in another formula feel-good romantic comedy. As a simple guy in a New England Hicks-Town, Sandler is loved by all the towns-folk for his cheerful disposition and his magical way of always wanting to help people out. When he is snatched away from his little piece of Paradise to accept a 40 billion dollar inheritance from a media tycoon in NYC, a snowball-effect of events starts to roll.Vaguely similar to Steve Martin's "The Jerk", but sadly quite predictable and far fetched. Many side-gags for pop-culture buffs are included. The best ones are a take on "Mr. French" and references to the Sunday Funny Papers. The frequent "appearing/disappearing act" of the butler character at first is spooky, but works well with the surprise at the end.The final scene (I won't give it away) is a cute way of showing how much Deeds wants to help out the little people. Some of the "cut scenes" are hilarious, although some (like the pizza delivery) are a bit risqu. Otherwise, this is a safe bet for all ages. A very pleasant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Deeds, the latest movie to get an airing at Te Awamutu's Regent Theatre, may be light entertainment but it comes with a heavy message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Longfellow Deeds, as played by The Wedding Singer star Adam Sandler, comes to find that money truly has the power to change things, but it doesn't necessarily need to change him. The small-town pizzeria owner and poet, who would do anything for anyone if it might improve their day, finds himself unwittingly inheriting a staggering $40 billion fortune from his late great uncle. Moving from his unheard of home town of Mandrake Falls in New Hampshire to the big city of New York, Deeds finds himself gaining unwanted attention from TV news presenter Mac McGrath, played by English actor Jared Harris, with the aid of junior journalist Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder). Deeds, as he prefers to be called, soon teaches the suits who now run his great uncle's company that he is more than capable of living up to his name by doing good with money without allowing it to corrupt him. But not all ends up as predicted. What is predictable, for an American film like Mr Deeds, is portraying one of the main villains as an Englishman in the form of Mac McGrath. Also predictable, within the scenario the film establishes, is how Bennett goes undercover to get her story ? and how she falls in love with the genuine Deeds as a result. But will it work out? For the most part the characters are a little one-dimensional, but comic value is achieved with the use of sneaky butler Emilio Lopez, played with glee by John Turturro, and the grotesque character of Crazy Eyes, played by the kooky Steve Buscemi. The 96-minute movie, directed by Steven Brill, is little more than a light comedy with a moral message accessible to all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't pretend that I've seen ALL of Adam Sandler's films. I haven't. However, I've seen most of them and most of them have been funny. 'Billy Madison' and 'The Waterboy' are two of the funniest films the 90s have produced, and even 'Big Daddy', which I expected to suck, was surprisingly good. Unfortunately, this film does suck.I haven't seen 'Mr Deeds Goes To Town' (the film that this is based on or remade or whatever, I don't know cos, like I said, I haven't seen it) but if it's any worse than this then I don't understand why anyone would've wanted to remake it.This doesn't 100% suck; it has it's moments, but when a great comic actor like Steve Buscemi is in a film and all his lines sound like they're supposed to be funny but aren't, then that film's gonna be crap. That film is 'Mr Deeds' - a romantic comedy where the romance makes me gag and the comedy bores me with its constant repetitiveness.This film is only rescued by a couple of funny moments and Winona Ryder looking hot, as per usual, which makes it just about tolerable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with most (decent) Adam Sandler movies is that he can't shy away from one specific type of character- the loser. For once he has, and the problem now? He was in no way believable. I will admit that 'Mr. Deeds' will give most viewers (including myself) a few laughs at the cant-describe-it-as-anything-else-but-stupid humor (I had to roll my eyes at the references to the classic 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and actually most of the things that Winona Rider said). Her character was completely underdeveloped for as big a role she played, as was the love story involved, which long ago became weak and over-used. (These parentheses contain a SPOILER in the love section: One of the characters does something wrong, but in the process falls in love, and then tells the truth, and states their love, then the other character is angry because the first one lied, and then the first character must come up with some remarkably unoriginal comment to get the other to believe there was good intent. See what I mean??? Weak and over-used.) So, if you're one of those to find things like natural gas extremely humorous, you're going to seriously enjoy this movie. Otherwise, 'Happy Gilmore' and 'Billy Madison' fans will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Deeds - Worth the $8.50, but Not Just for Sandler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This past weekend I muscled up my $8.50 and went and saw the new Adam Sandler flick Mr. Deeds. Coming into the film, I had virtually zero expectations, but left feeling somewhat fulfilled. Something was odd though, something was off. The joy I had experienced from the movie was only partially the result of its star, Adam Sandler. There was another actor in Deeds that deserves billing for the film, I'm talking about a man with more attitude than even Sandler. That's right, my man Johnny Mac, John McEnroe. The scenes that played out between McEnroe and Sandler running through New York belligerently drunk were hilarious. Maybe I'm just a mark for McEnroe, but watching him prance around the NYC streets while tossing beer bottles and throwing eggs at moving cars was enough to make the film worth my money. I honestly have not laughed that hard at a movie in quite some time. So take my advice, see the film and have a good time with it.</fullReview>

The film takes on a sappy love plot yet is almost entirely unable to make the audience enjoy it, as previous Sandler films were, `Big Daddy' and "The Wedding Singer" for instance. My explanation for this is that the initial plot for the film was created in the 30's, citing once again the lack of need for remakes.Sander's trademark lack of acting skills doesn't help here either since comedy, which he is good at, appears hardly ever. It is rarely attempted throughout the movie, and when it is it reeks of Sandler (who had no part in the writing of the film), throwing himself out of character and interrupting the film's direction. This funniness is oftentimes not funny at all, and resembles more the glossy funny-in-concept humor of "Little Nicky" than what we expected from a younger, immature, funny Sandler. Jokes are not mindless enough (fun can only be poked at the name "Longfellow" so many times), love scenes too serious, and only one unoriginal musical number. Sandler plays a na?ve country boy in the film, instead of the bad boy advertisers have made his character out to be, and was, if this movie had to be made at all, miscast.However, I award this film with a "7" and suggest you see it (perhaps on video) for one reason; it is, unfortunately, one of John Turturro's funniest performances. This is a pity because it is quite obvious that the rest of the cast couldn't care less about the film, Gallagher and Rider in particular provide the most half-assed jobs of their careers. Even Sandler pals Allen Covert and Rob Schneider (who appears for only two lines to reprise his "Big Daddy" role) are at their all-time worst. Yet, Turturro provides the audience with many much-needed laughs and, unlike his fellow cast members, does not allow a single joke to pass by unnoticed. I must admit, Steve Buscemi was also good, but he creeps me out.My final say on this movie: slightly worse than "The Wedding Singer," slightly better than "Little Nicky." Rent "Billy Madison" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar to other sandler fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the latest comedy from Adam Sandler, a remake of the old film "Mr. Deed's Goes To Town." Sandler once more plays a small town simpleton (isn't it time for him to stretch a bit?) who, this time, inherits a fortune from the rich uncle he never knew he had. He is conned both by the president of his rich uncle company (Peter Gallagher, also playing a role he has donned many times before) and the newswoman who seduces him to get a story (a miscast, but cute enough that we dont care, Winona Ryder). This is a fairly slight but harmless comedy that should satisfy the less demanding audience members who are expecting a typical Adam Sandler film, closer to his "Happy Gilmore" days than his "Big Daddy" period. GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler is back and better than ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his disappointing "Little Nicky," the fans were still wondering if funny man Adam Sandler still had the goods. And does he? You betcha! Adam Sandler still has the goods in "Mr. Deeds," the remake of the classic "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," starring Gary Cooper and directed by Frank Capra. Directed by Steven Brill (co-wrote and directed "Little Nicky" and wrote "The Mighty Ducks" movie and "Ready to Rumble"), the movie begins when 82-year-old billionaire Preston Blake (Harve Presnell) dies while climbing up the top of the mountain. Next, we go to New Hampsheire where Longfellow Deeds-just call him Deeds- (Adam Sandler), a pizza-delivery guy, realizes that Blake was his Uncle that he never knew and left him $40 billion. Meanwhile, 2 businessmen-Cecil Anderson (Erick Avari) and Chuck Cedar (Peter Gallagher)- want to make sure they keep the fortune and make sure that Deeds doesn't get anything. In his new home, he meets Emilio Lopez (John Turturro), Preston's butler, his new butler. Keep in mind. He's very, very sneaky. He likes to creep up and scare you. One night, Deeds meets a beautiful woman named Pam Dawson (Winona Ryder) who happens to work for "Inside Access" and is a journalist trying to get the story on Deeds taking over Blake's fortune. But, the more they meet each other, the more they're starting to fall in love with each other. Besides Longfellow Deeds, my favorite character is Emilio. He cracks me up every time I see him, whenever he's appearing and disappearing. And Crazy Eyes (Steve Buscemi). Every time you see him on-screen, he's hilarious, especially with his crazy eyes (hence the name). There were some other great charcters too, but, Deeds, Emilio, and Crazy Eyes are my favorite charcters in the whole movie.Is it better than "Little Nicky?" YES! Is it Adam Sandler's best film? No. Is it right next to his best films? Yes. If you're a big fan of Adam Sandler (like me), or in need of a good laugh (like me), or both (like me), then "Mr. Deeds" is your ticket. P.S.: Remember when Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers) from "Happy Gilmore" and The Farmer-a.k.a. "You can do it!"-(Rob Schneider) appeared in "Little Nicky?" Well, Nazo, the Delivery Boy (Rob Schneider) from "Big Daddy" appeares in "Mr. Deeds." Also, Reverend Al Sharpton and Tennis star and the host of "The Chair" John McEnroe make cameo appearances as well.A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat different Adam Sandler Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i liked it. it wasn't as funny as some other adam sandler movies...which is kind of what i want to talk about. many people said this was a typical adam sandler movie, and i have to disagree. first of all, it wasn't filled with a million one-liner catch phrases like happy gilmore. and second, i kept waiting for him to do those annoying voices he usually does, like that "abby dooby" thing or the yelling thing. but he did niether. while he did start punching a few people, he didn't raise his voice and shout out obsenities. for example, take when he found out his friend had faked sick and that was why he had to work that day. if this had been any other adam ssandler movie, he would have started whailing on him and calling him names. but instead he laughed and shrugged it off. he even complimented him for how realistic his "sick voice" had been.and sandler had barely had any comedic lines at all. while there was still some slapstick comedy on his part, for the majority of the movie, he played the straight man to the servant and the black guy. and while all this seperates this movie from his others, that may be why sandler fans didn't like it. sure, the movie itself was made in the style of any other adam sandler movie, but his character wasn't that of any other adam sandler movie. he played someone who already had everything he wanted in life. he played a character who saw the big picture, not some sleezeball who was just trying to get rich or get famous or get laid. he played the nice guy who everyone loved. which is hard to say about any of his other characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, did a lot of jokes miss the mark. Sometimes I wonder what Sandler was thinking during many of the bits in "Mr. Deeds." Yet despite the misfires and half-assed zings, the movie as a whole still left me happy.John Turturro was actually a better scene-stealer than I expected, especially when conveying the zeal his charater had in being sneaky (of course, his ability to appear instantly next to others was classic). Steve Buscemi was astonishingly creepy with his ability to play a walleyed convict. But were these performances enough to make me like this movie as much as I did?In a way. Because what they give is what the core of most Adam Sandler movies give: good-heartedness. Sandler's movies always have a penchant for do-right sensibilities, even if their hearts (or performances, or plot decisions, etc.) are not always in the right place. No matter what, Sandler is not out to get you. Yeah, he'll punch the lights out of any obnoxious windbags that cross him (and he gets to do that a lot in "Deeds"), but it's only because they're being rude. It doesn't mean he doesn't like them; he just has a funny way of teaching them manners.Winona Ryder's performance was not on the level of the more memorable ones mentioned above. Neither was Sandler's. So what? They still did their requisite jobs in carrying the movie; and they delivered earnestness, which made this otherwise terrible movie happy. This is not a "Happy Gilmore" or "Wedding Singer," but if you pay attention, the spirit of those movies lives on in "Mr. Deeds." It's a tribute to Sandler that he can still get that part right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler sticks to his recipe of creating happy, and funny movies. Every character in the movie is original and funny, and the love story mixes with the plot and comedy very well. The only downside to this movie is that the beginning of it is kind of sloppy and under-constructed, although the development of the characters throughout the movie and the ongoing laughs keep you smiling and engaged. This is definitely another memorable and classic work of Adam Sandler - the same as he has always been throughout the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Deeds is a classic story. This version of the film keeps the corny feelings of this small town American every man alive. Sandler has once again surrounded himself with talented people to bring a modern sense to Mr. Deeds. I really enjoy the humor of Sandler. He is not an actor, but is funny. The film allows him to be that, funny and charming, while the other character help move the story along. I was happy to see more of the same success from his previous films and leave the edgy Nicky behind.The one draw back to this film is in the editing. There are some parts of the movie that go for the joke e.g. ?you a virgin? Who would believe that?' In the trailers, on it's own I can see the humor. But it is obviously inserted for the laugh as the time of the date is mentioned before the phone call scene to make the date. Small editing problems gave this movie a sense of odd pacing. All of the humor fit, but it was in the wrong places some times.Overall great experience, another win from Sandler, with a great soundtrack, and fun games on the CD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, by far, Adam Sandler's best film. I have already seen it 3 times and it was just released today. I am Adam Sandler's biggest fan, so I may be a bit biased, but I just loved this movie. A lot of people are complaining about the romance factor but thats just stupid. It's good to see Adam redeeming himself after Little Nicky. He is also starting to branch out and play some more serious roles, which is good for him I think. I thought Deeds was very very funny and very sweet. The plot was good and the characters were awesome. I just loved it! It's my new favorite movie. I have to also give credit to an awesome performance by John Turturro. He was so funny in this movie as the "sneaky" butler. We'll look for him in Adam's 2003 movie "Anger Management" But anyway, Adam Sandler's new movie Mr. Deeds is definitely a good fan for Sandler fans and non-fans alike. It's funny, and romantic, and just an overall good time.Adam Sandler is one of the greats in comedy, we know that. But I say, give him a chance at other things people. Like Paul Thomas Anderson's "Punch Drunk Love" coming this fall. It's a "dramady", and the great San-doo is gonna kick butt and stack 'em ten high!

The film starts out terrible, almost containing no laughs the entire first 35 minutes. Once we get to know some of the supporting characters, such as a foot-fetish butler played by the great John Turturro, the film shows some glimpses of hope; but those occasions are few and far between. For the most part, excluding a few laughs, this film is anything but classic Sandler comedy. For the record, I liked Little Nicky. This film shows the least effort of any recent Sandler comedy, if that is possible. Wait for cable.</fullReview>

It is awful to see how some people view profit and greed over peoples lives. Where money is viewed as the value of the person. Mr Deeds does not change for his character would not allow that. It appears where I work, no matter how much overtime many of my miserable co workers do, I see no magical change that some believe the extra money will bring. Deeds does not let the wealth go to his head, like many rich and powerful people. In the end he finds true love, and has fun acting silly.

It's a great, light-hearted comedy where you get hilarity from beginning to almost the end. Yes, ok, the end gets cheesy, but there are some very funny aspects to this movie, and it's not just the traditional slapstick comedy Sandler, his clever side was hard at work. There are a couple characters (Emilio, Anderson) who are funny from start to finish as the typical little parts that are hilarious and add so much value to the movie. Ryder was tolerable in her role, though she tends to be unbelievable in her character, as in other movies. All in all, it's very funny and I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Adam Sandler fare, but pretty entertaining nonetheless. Worth checking out if you're a Sandler fan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his funniest films `Happy Gilmore', `Billy Madison', and `The Wedding Singer' behind him, Adam Sandler seems to be losing his touch. He's given us duds like `Bulletproof' and the dreadful `Little Nicky'. But then there's some middle-of-the-road ones like `Big Daddy' and `The Waterboy', which is where this one falls. While it is pretty entertaining, it's nothing new.It's a loose remake of the Frank Capra classic, but it also has the Sandler formula-driven staples like the gross-out jokes, the bad singing, the recurring actor friends with cameos, and, of course, the `typical Adam Sandler character'. While you don't expect too much range out of him, he seems to play the loveable dork every time and it's getting a little old.There are numerous funny parts, but somehow this one doesn't have the fluid comic timing that made his earlier movies so appealing. Directed by Steven Brill, who also filmed the also New York-based (and previously bashed) `Little Nicky', this one could've used a little help.Supporting roles by Coen alumni John Turturro and Steve Buscemi boosted it a little, but not enough. Winona Ryder's romance seemed contrived, but passable. Usually Sandler's love interests in his movies are a little awkward, but who would be right to romance one of his characters? This may be one of the more normal characters he's played, but he's still got a little of everything else he's played in it as well.If you're a Sandler fan, you'll probably like it. Going into it not expecting anything but typical Adam Sandler fare will help, but one can only hope that he gets back on the right track. Check it out in the theater if you love his movies, but otherwise it won't kill you to wait for video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wretched piece of entertainment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest flaw with Adam Sandler's latest film 'Mr. Deeds' is the romance factor. That being said, the film is a romantic comedy in its' purest form and that really does not leave much to the forethought of the rest of this critique. Sandler might leave the directing duties to his colleagues, but this film has all the imprints of a Sandler flick. Director Steven Brill (Little Nicky, Heavyweights) might have his name attached as Director, but Sandler's musical touches, the gross out gags and the toilet humor are pervasive in this film that rots as it progresses even more so than Sandler's 'Little Nicky' debacle. Based on the Frank Capra film 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town', this film taints that classic by mere association due to its' horrendous direction, lackluster script and pathetic clichd values. Sandler assembles the whole gang and fans will be able to spot the regulars he assembles for his films, yet the laughs elicited are due in part to the stupidity and ludicrousness this film emits. From Sandler's first foray into cinema, Sandler could have always made you walk out of the theatre with a laugh. Even with the deplorable 'Little Nicky' you still respected him for making you laugh, even if it was in the most ridiculous context ever. Yet, with this film, Sandler seems to have driven a terrible nail in his coffin as studios will balk at his weak product. The script is based upon Robert Riskin's script for Capra's film, but the differences are rampant. Set in present day, our Mr. Deeds (Sandler) inherits his Great Uncle's 40$ Billion Multimedia Empire. Forced into a brief stay in New York City to sign the legal papers, he becomes enchanted by a Reporter (Winona Ryder) who is posing as a school nurse to obtain the inside scoop for her tabloid television show. I do not know what is more embarrassing for Winona Ryder, getting caught shoplifting or having this film as the pedestal for her comeback. Her weakly detailed character has no background and is at the center of a thinly layered script in which the dialogue is even worse than that of George Lucas' last picture. As for Sandler, empathy is shared with him for he seems sorry for himself starring in this weak, recursive and studio driven film that seems to want to insult us and destroy Sandler's career with this miserable piece. The zest and the charisma Sandler displayed in 'Big Daddy' and 'Happy Gilmore' seems to be lost. In this film, Sandler portrays a well-grounded and down to earth small town man who does not care for money. Hollywood Insiders have said the same for Sandler, yet after screening this film, I wonder what makes him select his pieces. Is it his heart, or his wallet? This film does not contain one frame of worthiness, which is a shame considering Sandler has actors like John Turturro and Steve Buscemi in the film. The only thing I kept thinking to myself were these actors' respective portrayals in the Coen Brothers' classic 'The Big Lebowski'. I also thought to myself, how can they go from there to here? While this critique is jagged and does not shy away from criticizing the film, it must be noted that expectations were low before entering the film. Sandler is in a downward spiral and we all know it. Yet, even while 'Little Nicky' was horrible, it still made you smile. This film tears away at the seams for how poorly assembled it is made. Even Sandler's choice of music is weak as compared to his other films. The majority of romantic comedies are bad films, even 'Big Daddy' had a romantic undertone but that film handled it well. In this film, we are propelled into an unrealistic and morbid love affair between two characters we could not care less about. When screening a film and the feeling of pleasure suddenly turns into a chore, something is wrong. That can be applied to Sandler's career right now. He has lost a loyal fan with this terrible display of cinema and has tainted a Hollywood classic. What is next for Sandler? Honestly, who cares!Giancarlo's Rating: *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>you can SIT through this and that's about it. it's nooooo waterboy or wedding singer. it's plot is boring and predictable, the acting kind of bland, and winona ryder doesn't have any charm of drew barrymore or fairuza balk (wedd sing &amp; waterboy) and is just plain annoying in her eyes bulging/sneering way. adam sandler plays it so low key and boring that he's just not funny. the extras are wasted as actors and winona ryder like i said is miscast and out of her league..she just isn't funny. perhaps reese witherspoon or renee zelwegger could have made something out of the plot but as time passes, winona ryder, an actress i used to love, just seems less and less able as an actress with less and less range. she actually made a good character totally annoying with no redeeming qualities except she's cute or something.overall, a renter or go see it at the $1.50 movie, but don't pay $8!!! you'll regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not say this movie totally sucked cause it didn't but it was a far cry from the typical Sandler movie we have come to know and love. This was a far cry from where Big Daddy was. The humor is this one was subpar and not as crude as it could have been compared to other Sandler movies but then again, one of his last offerings was Little Nicky which isn't saying much either. To be honest, Adam seems to be losing his touch. It was a good romance and a good story. It just was not what I expected at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen Adam Sandler in the past then you know what to expect in Mr. Deeds. Sandler is at his top when delivering in this movie but unfortunately he doesn't make the delivery often enough (blame the director on this one).The storyline is thinly veiled and has been seen umpteen times in other forgettable movies. Rich but kind billionaire dies leaving everything to some poor but kind-hearted schleps that must do battle with evil executives to save the company and jobs. Throw in a weak performance by Ms. Shoplifting Ryder as a sneaky reporter out to get Sandler/girl that falls in love with Sandler and you have the entire premise for 98 minutes of occasional laughs.The supporting cast does fair san John Turturro who is the shining star of the cast. His delivery, along with Sander's, made the movie palatable and keeps the laughs going when the jokes fail. Long lines of cameos are in this movie and a close eye will catch Rob Schneider in a variety of costumes.Overall we see Sandler at his funniest but trying to build a storyline out of weak script makes the overall movie a pie in the face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and romance combined into one. Kind of like Big Daddy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many funny parts to this movie, and many romance parts. But the main story is like this: LongFellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) inherits $40 billion dollars from his great uncle he never knew he had. Deeds then goes to New York for the signing of the documents. Before that, he takes a detour to a Connecticut Wendy's. In New York, Deeds then falls in love with a reporter who claims she is a high-school nurse raised in a small town (Whinchesterfieldton, Iowa). This "nurse" works for a sneaky news channel in which she has a hidden camera on her at every date she and Deeds goes to (The "nurse", claiming to be Pam Dawson, is played by Winona Ryder). What Deeds does with the $40 billion dollars is outstanding (not really). Let's just say there is a funny stockholder meeting near the end of the movie. And yes, there is a water fountain filled with Hawaiian Punch in the Bedroom. See the movie coming out June 28, 2002! It's worth the $6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Sandler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Preview at UCLA (May 5, 2002) - This film has some funny lines, and features a plot similar in seriousness to "Big Daddy". Since I was warned that this movie was made by the same people who did that movie, I was not expecting much. Adam Sandler plays Longfellow Deeds, a great-nephew to one of the world's richest men who happens to die at the beginning of the movie. Deeds inherits 40 billion dollars, but since he's from a small unknown town in New Hampshire, he does not see the need to have so much money. He is betrayed by a woman who tells him she's a small town girl and claims to love him, but it turns out she's only a desperate news reporter trying to get a story. The ending is cute though.and there are a ton of typical Sandler gags.many of them funny.including his often seen violent temper. If you're looking to watch a light comedy with Sandler on par with Big Daddy and Waterboy, this movie shouldn't disappoint you. But it's no Wedding Singer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saved by Adam Sandler's charm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many times in this movie where I just think to myself, "This movie was written for six-year-olds." One of the main jokes is Steve Buscemi as 'Crazy Eyes,' and he orders a pizza with French fries and Oreos. That gag isn't allowed to be funny to anyone above the age of ten.But alas, I liked the casting. Adam Sandler, while not trying for any awards, can really sell the 'good guy' role. Winona Ryder's a sweetheart who I really sympathize with. (Although I found it extremely sexist that her name is Babe.) The other Sandler-movie actors were nothing special though. I don't like it when bad actors get roles based on their friends, but it's not like I can change that.While the premise is silly, it's still a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Deeds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the classic Gary Cooper/Frank Capra original, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, this takes only small remnants of the source material to create a more up-to-date modern version, and fails miserably, from director Steven Brill (Little Nicky, Without a Paddle). Basically multi-millionaire Preston Blake (Patch Adams's Harve Presnell) dies while climbing the summit of Mount Everest, and his company's attorney Chuck Cedar (Sex, Lies, and Videotape's Peter Gallagher) and Cecil Anderson (The Mummy's Erick Avari) are now looking for his closest living relative to give the assets to. They find that in his nephew, naive New Hampshire pizzeria owner and wannabe greetings card poetry writer Longfellow Deeds (Razzie nominated Adam Sandler), who obviously doesn't completely grasp the fact that he has inherited a mass fortune, $40 billion to be exact. Mr. Deeds is brought with them to New York, and he finds himself surrounded by people who are giving him advice he cannot really follow and trying to get their own piece of fortune for their own gains. Meanwhile the press are also trying to find out more about the person who has inherited the multi-million dollar fortune, and it is up television tabloid reporter Babe Bennett (Razzie nominated Winona Ryder) to get close to Deeds, as she poses as an innocent small town girl. In the process of getting to know him Babe loses track of her scoop and finds herself falling in love with the naive millionaire, who is spending his fortune on meaningless things, and even giving away thousands of dollars to people he has never met, e.g. kids and tramps. Cedar knows that he and his associates and shareholders need to get their money back from Deeds, and he does not care how it is done, he eventually comes up with the plan to sell the company. By the end Deeds realises that money is not the most important in his life or anybody else's, and when it looks like everything is lost the true intentions of Blake Media come to light, and his butler Emilio Lopez (Quiz Show's John Turturro) gets everything, while Deeds gets a billion dollars and is happy with Babe. Also starring Allen Covert as Marty, Jared Harris as Mac McGrath, Edward Scissorhand's Conchata Ferrell as Jan, Steve Buscemi as Crazy Eyes, Peter Dante as Murph, John McEnroe and Rob Schneider as Nazo the Italian Delivery Man (from Big Daddy). Sandler is usually a tolerable enough dumb character, but here he is not witty or likable as Cooper was, especially with that stupid black foot, Ryder is a silly choice for a journalist who becomes his love interest, and many of the other cast members are just as bad or annoying, especially Buscemi with his stupid eyes, only moments of Turturro are amusing with his accent. The story should be witty and have a sweet charm about it, with the leading character and how he comes into his fortune and what he does with it, but here it is just an excuse to see a near retarded simpleton get rich, surrounded by equally stupid characters doing almost nothing but throw his money away, and there are the horrible mushy sentimental moments too, absolutely none of it made me laugh, it an atrocious comedy. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel. Very poor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mr Deeds" tells the fictional story (although i guess it could happen in real life) of country hick Longfellow Deeds (Sandler, who stretches himself and plays a lovable goofball) who inherits billions of dollars from a distant uncle. To seal the deal he must go to New York to do all the paperwork. While here he discovers some people are mean and try to take advantage of people. Will Deeds be screwed over and left with nothing? See it to find out (or watch another Sandler movie and take a wild guess).Has its moments, and has some great scenes and lines, but it's no Oscar candidate (this was later proved when it wasn't nominated for an Oscar). Some great work by the supporting cast, most notably Steve Buscemi and John Turturro. Not bad, some good quirky laughs to be had.</fullReview>

It was faintly funny with a sub par plot. Sandler and Ryder do not make a good duo at all, they both looked uninspired. You already know what you are going to get from Sandler, sometimes he is funnier than others. Please tell me what memorable film Ryder ever did in which she was a significant contributor? In fact, whenever I think of Winona Ryder (besides thinking klepto), I think of Beetle Juice and Edward Scissorhands: two movies from the 80's, and two movies in which she was just a subsidiary role player.Mr. Deeds just didn't have it. It seemed like it was more to fill the Sandler one-movie-a-year quota rather than be a decent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being an Adam Sandler fan I went to see this film when it was released. It has to be said that I was somewhat disappointed with it. I was expecting to see the same humour and wit as seen in films such as 'The Waterboy', 'Happy Gilmore' and 'Big Daddy' that make you laugh out loud. This film however just really isn't really that funny. Scenes such as the 'echoing scene' which you will soon realise, are just pointless. It's also disappointing to see the likes of 'Steve Buscemi' and 'John Turturro' featuring in a film like this after previously being in films such as 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Clockers' respectively.The storyline for this film has the potential to be a decent film worth watching but on this occasion it simply hasn't delivered. The fact that he inherits so much money just isn't used effectively at all. What should have come out should have been a matured version of 'Ritchie Rich' where the kid goes on the rampage with unlimited amounts of money at his fingertips. Instead, it surrounds Mr Deeds boring relationship with 'Pam Dawson'.All in all, this film really hasn't achieved its full potential. I think Sandler needs to go back to basics and bring us back some of the laughs that made 'Billy Madison', 'The Wedding Singer' etc.. such enjoyable films.</fullReview>

I won't enter into the "ordinary" bad elements such as implausible plot or flat acting - what really bothered me in this movie was the absolutely incredible and incomprehensible violence!!! If someone in real life REALLY acted as violently as Adam Sandler does in this movie, most people be seriously afraid of such a person. In fact, he would probably be arrested by the police, criminal charges would be pressed against him - that's not the kind of person normal people want to socialise with! This must be the all-time low of Winona Ryder's (otherwise great) career, to act the role of a girl that is drawn to a guy like that!

		<shortDescription>Formulaic Sandler Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mr. Deeds" features the "affable comic genius" of Adam Sandler as a countryside rube who somehow inherits $60 billion from the will of his estranged uncle whom, until recently, never even had the chance to meet, and travels to the Big Apple to tangle with extortionate media moguls and corporate thieves out to bereave him of his fortunes. Here is a film that is marred with a hackneyed, unoriginal formula of a plot: lowly innocent receives fortune, spends as he pleases, hires eccentric, yet amiable butler, meets girl, falls in love, discovers she only digs him for her profession and his money, loses fortune to villain, reclaims fame and fortune through emotionally connecting to avaricious board members, falls back in love, is a renowned hero and study, blah, blah, blah, you get the picture. Such a bland and ingenuous formula is hardly buoyed by the dismal acting of Sandler and Wyona Ryder, whose chemistry is comparable to a wrangling cat and dog. To keep it pithy, "Mr. Deeds" is about as charming and original as white plaster on a wall. And it even exhausts itself of decent material after awhile, with an awfully languid flow of ideas, if you ask me! Despite his noble intentions, couldn't Deeds spend more of his billions on whims rather than charity (hey, it's supposed to be an amusing comedy, and what's the fun in following a "philanthropic billionaire"?). Yet, for all its many deficiencies, there are some bearable elements to enjoy here. The scenes with the butler (John Tuturro) are fairly amusing (especially when he hammer Deeds' "peculiar foot"). Hey, even the scene with Deeds outfoxing the Wall Street tycoons at the end is, only a few $ billion short of inspired. Yet, most of "Mr. Deeds" is rife with bland formula, cloying gags, implausibility, and is essentially a typical Sandler circus, replete with (you guessed it) many of his costars from previous films. I have yet to view the original 1939 classic from which this dreck is inspired, yet I am certain this is a travesty of a classic concept in comparison with that film. If you enjoy routine Sandler humor, Sandler material, Sandler formula, and Sandler resolution, then you'll find this comedy delightfully funny. For anyone else, this is simply a cinematic ally and intellectually bankrupt billionaire romp with few moments of good appraisal and interest. Avoid "Mr. Deeds"; see the original instead: I'm sure it is leaps and bounds better than this! *1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandler's second worst film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some spoilers)I haven't seen the original version of this film, but 'Mr. Deeds' is a tiresome formula, that has nothing remarkable within. Granted, Sandler's Deeds is quite likable, but he is also extremely sanctimonious to every character he encounters. This film is not that funny, and it has far too many groan-inducing scenes. Particularly, Sandler and co's rendition of David Bowie's "Rocket Man". The echo jokes and Steve Buscemi's Crazy Eyes character. And don't get me started on the whole "little kid inside all of us!" routine. Am I meant to buy the sincerity here?For the most part, Sandler plays a nicer version of most characters he plays! He's okay. However, the plot stinks, and the whole film is not that funny. I chuckled once I think! The love story doesn't quite work although Winona Ryder does try hard to be convincing as the woman who falls really really hard for Longfellow Deeds. John Turturro is quite good as the very sneaky butler, but we all know where his story arc will end up. Peter Gallagher does not really become a memorable nemesis for Deeds! And while I generally love seeing Steve Buscemi in any movie, his character was so downright stupid and unfunny, and one feels that his talent was wasted in this movie. Look out for Richard Harris' son, Jared Harris (Igby Goes Down, I Shot Andy Warhol) as Mac McGrath, in this movie! This is not Sandler's worst film, but it still feels very typical of his style of work. Most of Sandler's vehicles have some things going for them. Either a) they are stupidly funny and makes you laugh a lot, b) Sandler's character is endearing or actually really funny or c) the supporting cast really adds to the film. 'Mr. Deeds' doesn't really have any of these elements, and you feel that Sandler doesn't improve or dramatically change one way or the other in this movie. Add this to the groaning elements within this film, then it's pretty poor. However, 'Little Nicky' (also directed by Brill) still takes the mantle as Sandler's worst film, however 'Mr.Deeds' is still rubbish!** out of *****!</fullReview>

John Turturro is the only good thing in it, in a rather thankless role as the sterotyped butler. It tries to be this feel-good movie that includes a whole bunch of fistfights -- there's a problem in itself - don't recall too many feel-good movies with even one fistfight. There's so many holes in the plot and the characters are two dimensional. Found myself cringing and rolling my eyes. Dumb dumb dumb. Go rent the original. Frank Capra must be rolling in his grave.

		<shortDescription>Terrible!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen most of Adam Sandlers films, I would have to say this is probably his worst film to date(although this could slightly be better than Billy Madison- but only just).Very Predictable, one of the worst films of 2002(I watched a rent dvd of this), can't understand why someone like Winona Ryder would agree to such crap as this(I guess money was the main reason). If you haven't seen previously and are thinking of hiring it out or buying it, don't, there are much better films out there- this isn't one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasting Sandler's Talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an awful movie. Sandler is surrounded by top supporting talent with Wynona Ryder and John Turturro, but the director (or maybe Sandler himself) gave him(self) little or nothing to do. When you ask the audience to suspend their cognitive thought process and focus on fantasy - then let them have a fantasy. Or, at least some attempt at it. Unbelieveable plot line (although I've not benefited from viewing the original) about a hick from New Hampshire (not a great marketing technique here) who inherits $40 billion from never known grand uncle. Right! Sure...ok maybe.Sandler is off to New York and meets up with Wynona Ryder, an entertainment news producer, and of course falls in love - until, of course he discovers her true ID. Turturro plays the disappearing butler who likes feet. Turturro hands in a fine performance and that is the only thing that makes the movie worth the rental price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler has 2 characters- Retarted Sensitive Guy and Sensitive Guy with Anger Problems. Little Nicky got Retarted Guy played out, and now the sensitive guy with anger problems is sucking. A number of corny jokes and predictable and just plain stupid scenes and things bogged down the movie, but I'm a big Adam Sanlder fan, and still didn't HATE this movie. There were a few jokes I liked ("you have underestimated the sneakiness") and scenes I liked (the "Space Oddity" scene that I dont think kids will get) in it, and Steve Bushemi was cool as usual ("Time heals everything...except for these crazy eyes"). This is for Sandler fans to enjoy. C, 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie about a guy who inherits fourty billion dollars then gives it away for love...Why is it the most powerfull execs in Hollywood are constantly pumping it down the throats of their viewers that to be happy all you have to do is give, spend and donate?...how many of the execs that actually make these films practice what they are preaching with stories like Adam Sandlers "Mr. Deeds"? First of all I didn't find the movie very comical, Adam Sandler is both drab and seriously needs acting lessons although, my five year old son did enjoy it the first time around. Can I recommend this movie to other viewers? Not unless you want to be preached at (by the storyline) about how you can only be happy if you give away all your money but hang on to enough to keep renting boring movies like this one. Lets see the producers of these movies practice what they preach...give your viewers their money back on this one...it was a complete waste of 100,000 feet of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>D: Steven Brill. S: Adam Sandler, Peter Gallagher, Winona Ryder, Allen Covert, Harve Presnall, Peter Dante, Steve Buscemi.This is the story about a young man named Lonfellow Deeds, a man who lives in a small quiet town in New Hampshire. He makes a living delivering pizza's and making nonsense greeting cards. One day while delivering pizza's on his circuit he finds out that his uncle died and left him 40 Billion dollars. His response to all of this is... "Ok". So now he has to move all the way out to New York and live in his uncles old house, just to be conned and seduced by Winona Ryder's character, and Chuck Cedar played by Peter Gallagher. Over all terrible movie. I don't remember laughing more than once at anything besides John Turturro as a spanish butler. Peter Gallagher was bad, Winona Ryder was bad, and even Steve Buscemi was bad in his two bit role. So here it is another stinkbomb by Adam Sandler. Beware, if you have to choose between risking it with that one or somehting else, go with something else, I'll recommend something right now... Insomnia.Co-Starring: Erick Avari, John McEnroe, Blake Clark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess you could consider the following spoilers, but I don't know if you can spoil this ? work. There were 3 good scenes. When Hallmark finally buys his card and you see people reading it, When the Butler gets the Billions, and When 'Nona goes to Iowa. The only good thing I can say about the rest of it was that it had an interesting soundtrack. The rest is just product endorsements and easy paychecks for a lot of talented people who evidently think that making money this way is OKAY. After sitting thru the whole thing I felt like I had been sold a train ride to Hawaii by some slick telemarketer. I am reminded of what Eddie Murphy said after he was involved in that movie about the tank - Best Defense - "If you'd have seen what they gave me to make it, you'd have done it too." Pretty sad. Sad to see people capable of so much huckstering Corvettes and Wendy's Frosties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My comment will end shortly, I promise. As the writers didn't bother themselves to make this film's plot any different from those of it's kind, than I'm not forced to work more then they did.I won't even bother myself to write down the movie plot, since it is almost non-existent; but what remains is a plaster of cinematic waste that doesn't fulfill any of its obligations: entertain or be funny. None.Adam Sandler makes his thing again: repeat the role of a stupid over liked country boy. The question that wanders around my mind is: Isn't Adam ashamed of himself to make such idiotic roles time after time? I mean take a look over his filmography: Big Daddy, Little Nicky, and let's not even talk about the Waterboy... one of the worst films ever made.This movie can't be saved from anything except for SOME slight funny MOMENTS.P.S ? If you want to preserve your mind's sanity, as well as some hope from Winona Ryder, DON'T see the women fight at the end. I have loss of words for that. Only one races to my thoughts: Miserable.Avoid; Avoid; Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bitter disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never have so many actors disappointed me so deeply, for so long. The acting, the plot, the script, the direction and the stunts were all of abysmal quality. The plot-summary (although that's an insult to decent hard-working plots the world over) is as follows: Sandler, wearing his trade-mark dead-pan (i.e. not acting) expression plays a pizza-man whose uncle (whom he's never met) leaves him heir to his multi-billion dollar entertainment company. Sandler goes to New York obstensibly to sign and bring his money back and leaving the company to be run by those who know. Ryder, a tabloid hack after the story and who does no more acting than the occaisional pout, furrowed brow and thrust breast, pretends to be a small-town girl from Iowa appealing to his small-town instincts and following a quite ridiculous John Macenroe cameo she falls in love with him; and he with her. But it all falls through when he finds out who she really is. I won't bore you with the rest but you can probably figure it out yourself without too much trouble, in fact you'd probably do a far better job than Sandler and company. The dialogue is unbearably weak, the jokes are as funny as a poke in the eye (in fact, please poke me in both, I might laugh then) and there are more cheesy stereotypes than a Van Damme film only without the choreographed fights.. oh! except for the one in the cinema as people scrambled for the exits. The only lighthearted moment (which ironically is quite inadvertant) is when Ryder, at the moment at the mercy of US justice for attempting to help Sachs clear some stock, is asked by her boss what she spends her money and she answers "On shoes and stuff.." and you could feel the whole cinema shouting "YES! BUT WHAT DO YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY ON!!" It is extraordinary that with children dying of hunger and me needing a new motorbike, money, and considerable amounts of the stuff, should be spent on this kind of tosh. If you want to see a butler ghosting around the place properly, if you want to see how overnight wealth can be made hilarious, if you want sparkling dialogue and witty situational comedy don't go and see this film. Go and see Murphy, Ackroyd and Elliot and Co. in "Trading Places". That's how it's done, Mr. Sandler.</fullReview>

I felt that Adam Sandler was just a little wooden. I didn't expect an Oscar winning performance but something more than just repeating lines from a script. I also am not a big Winona fan. However, I think she does better in dramatic roles. She really wasn't that funny. I did get some laughs out of the movie. The guy that plays the butler, (John Turturro, I think) was hilarious. So was the actor (I don't know his name) that is in a lot of Adam Sandler's movies, who played his friend from back home. But overall it just wasn't as funny as some of Sandler's previous movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very much effort put into this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Little Nicky flopped last year, I felt that a good thing had happened. I believed that the result would be that Sandler would go back to the drawing board and improve on his movies, shame I was only half right. Sandler did go back to the drawing board, but only to write down some old jokes we've heard before and to place them in a new movie. Basically, everything we saw in earlier Sandler films is present: cameos by Rob Schneider, Steve Buscemi and others, crude slapstick humour and blatant product placement (more on that later). But that's it, Sandler was obviously very careful as to not create another Little Nicky and just stuck to his original formula that was already proven successful. Which I found really disappointing, as there were few "laugh out loud" moments, heck, all the good jokes were already shown multiple times in the trailers. The only real joke that's worth mentioning would be the Emelio, Deeds' butler, who provides most of the comedy that this film contains. Adam Sandler himself plays his same-old, same-old role: a nice guy who is thrust into a situation that changes his world, we've seen that done before in all his past movies.As for the product placement that was mentioned earlier, it gets really blatant at several points in the film. Like how after leaving Deeds' hometown, they make a pit stop at a Wendy's and proceed to mention how good the food was throughout the film, there's also that infamous burning box of Special K in the burning apartment that Deeds goes for a rescue. I hate product placement badly, if I wanted to watch a bunch of ads, I would've stayed home and watched TV, instead of paying good money just to watch Deeds talk about how good Frosties are.Basically, this film isn't Sandler's worst, but it is pretty low on his list of previous works. See this one in one of the dollar theatres or just rent it, I don't recommend paying full price for it.5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad rip-off of a Coen brothers classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this movie, great. Drop any idea of seeing it, and go rent "The Hudsucker Proxy" instead. Because Mr. Deeds is just a bad rip-off of this Coen brothers classic. Its theme, a man from nowhere improbably rising to the top has been done before, and it rips off the Coen brother's movie to the detail. From the reporter girl who disguises her desire for knowledge with deceit, to the evil, schematic vice-president who uses the moronic hero for the exact same big corporation scandal, this is a perfect example of how you strap an old movie with new, popular actors, change around the story a bit (exaggerated "bit"), and you get a brand new movie which appeals to almost everyone. Let me tell you, "The Hudsucker Proxy" is a film classic by the Coen brothers, and includes more wit, humor, and memorable lines than Sandler has produced in his entire repetoire. It did poorly in the box office, but looking back at comments from IMDB users, it has been highly regarded in the company of other Coen brothers classics and great evil-corporation-conglomeration movies such as Brazil and Office Space.Looking back at this film, it's hard to tell which points I liked. Almost everything in this film I had seen before, and cliches are perhaps the worst things to appear in any movie. Perhaps the greatest flaw in this movie is its blatant use of Adam Sandler in a movie just to attract an audience, as he displays neither his charming self nor his affirmative attitude that he exhibits in his other roles. The story is using the basic story of "The Hudsucker Proxy", and turning it into a character piece about a benevolent country man trying to survive in a corporate, urban world. The balance is not there in this movie. Do yourself a favor and see the Coen brothers movie instead. I've mentioned it three times. If you want to know how great this concept could have been, go see that movie now. 4/10</fullReview>

Winona Ryder and Adam Sandler do not fit together and Winona was so annoying I was about to leave the theater just because of her. Most Sandler films have some clever and well placed jokes, but this movie did not. The movie simply added in random jokes and outrageously stupid material that did not fit at all. This was just one of those movies where you pretty much need a seatbelt at the movie theater to restrain yourself from leaving. Save your money and see a good movie.</fullReview>

Deeds has many, many funny lines and can almost keep you constantly laughing if you have a sense of humor. It also has a love story within it! So if your looking for a good laugh or want to see a funny Sandler movie, although he had no hand in writing this one, you will love this. 9.0/10.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite what the papers may say on how Adam Sandler and this movie are not funny, I must disagree. I really enjoyed it. Adam was very funny as Longfellow Deeds, Winona Ryder wasn't too bad, but I must say that the funniest parts of this film involved the very "sneaky" butler, played by John Turturro (hope I spelled that right) . He would be there then disappear a few seconds later, and he is obsessed with peoples feet and changing their socks. Funny funny funny. See this movie! You'll like it. I would give this movie a B+ to a A-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, Mr. Deeds, yatta yatta on and so forth. Adam Sandler "stars" in yet another one of his identical, typical, predictable "films", this time as the recipient of a huge sum of cash. Hmm, a stupid rich guy who acts retarded, pretends to be 12, who loses his girlfriend and finds love again in his own cute/dumb/retarded way. That's right, I'm talking about Billy Madison. No wait, I mean Big Daddy. Oh, that's right, this one is Mr. Deeds. Forgive me for not keeping track of this genius's filmography, each subsequent "film" just becomes more and more typical. The first 5 movies were enough, but let's keep it under 10, ok?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Critics need to give this movie a break</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think Adam Sandler sat down and went, "Hey, I'm going to make a really good remake to the original movie." Of course there's nothing for the critics to like about the movie. There are no crazy special affects or Academy award winning acting. The bottom line is that the movie is just enjoyable to watch. Adam Sandler's motives are to make people laugh, and not to make a movie that will only please critics. I would watch this movie 1000 times more before I would watch a movie such as Gosford park again. This movie should not even be compared to the original, it should be looked at as a completely different movie. When it comes down to it, I left the theatre after seeing this move with a big smile on my face. The movie was hillarious and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original film, but after I saw this, don't feel the urge to do it so. What can I say about this film: it sucks, and it sucks badly. Completely pointless, unreal, unfunny, lame dialogs, and very predictable. But what it strikes the most is why the big studios in Hollywood are producing films with Adam Sandler as the main character. Can't you see it?, HE SUCKS. I personally believe that you have a low self esteem (or a brain tumor) if you consider this guy funny, god forbid an average actor. And this turkey of a film doesn't make me change my point of view about this man. Not only doesn't make that, but also makes me believe that the stars conforming the supporting cast had taken LSD before reading the script. How can you make John Tuturro look silly and unfunny?, pair it with Sandler in a stinker movie. How can you make Steve Buscemi look disgusting and like a moron?. That's right, pair it with Sandler in a stinker movie. And the same goes with the rest. To sum up, if you like Adam Sandler doing the same type of character in the same Adam Sandler type of movie, I suggest you to view Mr Deeds. If you like to see a group of talented actor, doing it for the money and losing a bit of artistic credibility, I suggest you to view Mr. Deeds. But if you have good taste and like to have some earnest laughs, watch Mr. Deeds all the same, and try to find them. Heaven knows I couldn't</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently, quite a few people didn't like this movie. Don't expect "The Wedding Singer"! Longfellow Deeds is suddenly the heir to a media empire. What will he do? Why, what he's supposed to do: find out all about his new company and take over, right? Well, not exactly. Enjoy Deeds's introduction to "high society", his quirky new gal (she's just a "small-town girl" from Winchestertonfieldville!), and all the efforts of the "bad guy" to get Deeds out of the picture. Look for Steve Buscemi and Rob Schneider. Schneider actually is doing a cameo of one of the characters he has played in a previous Sandler film ("Big Daddy"). I thought it was cool. And, hey, forget Winona Ryder ever shoplifted, okay? She has done some good work before, even nominated for an Oscar ("Little Women"). Everyone has their quirks; hers just happens to be illegal, that's all. (Do I need to attach a *wink* to this??) I found the plot laugh-out-loud funny in places. Yeah, not Sandler's BEST movie, but definitely one of my favorites (I didn't like some of the acting performances...a lot can be said for good casting.) . I enjoyed the special makeup. Funny how little things can mean a lot with someone's appearance. Remember not to take this one seriously. It is Adam Sandler, after all. (I'm a huge fan. I own all his movies -- except "Little Nicky". Wish I never saw that one.) If you like Adam Sandler, you'll enjoy this one -- hopefully as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travesty. Lost the entire point of the movie. Watch the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(most of the spoilers will probably refer to the original 1936 film, so don't read on if you plan to watch that version).I saw the original recently and enjoyed it. I was then forced to watch the Adam Sandler version recently on a bus trip. I admit I was prejudiced. I don't generally like Adam Sandler's sophomoric "humor". And I normally think remakes are a bad idea (unless there is something that needs to be updated, removal of racism, sexism or improving on aspects that couldn't be done in the original). However, having liked the original and being a fan of Winona Ryder I gave it a chance.The only "updating" it really got was to include more stupid humor (bouncing cats), more swearing and flipping off. The entire point of the original film -- which stresses the disparity of the Great Depression vs. the obscenely rich was completely cut out! I saw this film as a chance to comment on our current society's economic disparity where under Bush Jrs' administration the rich are getting WAY richer and the middle class is becoming poor and the poor are just totally screwed. There is no understanding of this in this film. There is no social commentary (apart from some jabs at Entertainment "news" shows.)Even when Adam Sandler's Deeds tries to help people he just gives the money to one group he seems to select out of the area (not to say they're not worthy) - but the point of the first film was that he reaches out and tries to individually help as many people as he can.The movie is not just about one guy who is not greedy, it's also supposed to be about social responsibility. This movie weeded that out and replaced that with moronic/simplistic jokes instead.I also did not understand why this simple nice guy was so violent. This wasn't one justified punch this was pummeling some guy nearly to death and various other disturbing recurrent fights.I'm also docking it for featuring product placement (wendy's, corvettes, etc)Buscemi, Torturro &amp; Ryder gave fine performances for what they were given but they should be ashamed for having helped make this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the worst that I have ever seen. From one generic, phony plot point to another, the movie is completely disappointing. Those who are expecting the clever comedy and outrageous antics of Sandler's better movies, i.e. Big Daddy, will share my sentiments that this is one movie that all of the actors would have been better off avoiding. Bad acting, cheesy comics, and childish antics make this movie completely rotten and was a waste of a good hour and a half.Completely predictable storyline that tries to play on the pathos of the viewer to get them to sympathize with Sandler, combined with futile attempts to raise the movie's value with big names and cameos, makes this movie a complete loser.Not having seen it in theaters, I am sure the only audience members that did laugh were the 10-year-olds that accompanied their poor unsuspecting parents.</fullReview>

Mr. Deeds is only even remotely funny because of Adam Sandler. Without him, this movie would have been worthless.Adam plays Longfellow Deeds, yet another character with the IQ of a kid who's been held back a few grades. Deeds has the IQ of putty, is extremely quick to punch out anyone who he doesn't like, and through the whole thing is supposed to be a good guy. I can't stand idiots who think they're perfect just because they are too stupid to know any different. It amazes me that even though he's completely retarded and a loudmouth bully, the leading woman magically falls for him and everyone loves him. It's plain garbage.The story is so full of impossible twists and bland incredibly predictable turns you'll be hard pressed to even finish this movie. The few good laughs you'll get from Adam's comedic talent are hardly worth the pathetic love story that makes no sense whatsoever and the loud mouth Adam plays. Skip this movie unless you're really, really bored.- Rirath_com</fullReview>

When I saw the trailers I thought it had the potential to be hysterical, much like Water Boy, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. Unfortunately the laughs were only there and not evident at all throughout the rest of the movie. The story seems to have been a leftover script from Saturday Night Live which just opens and doesn't go anywhere. The characters are weakly developed, if at all, and the dialogue is ridiculous. Furthermore there is no chemistry whatsoever between Sandler and the female lead, Winona Ryder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Diminution of a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has done it again - plundered one of its treasures in service of the Almighty Buck. `Mr. Deeds' is, technically I guess, a remake of Frank Capra's marvelous 1936 classic `Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.' It's no surprise, perhaps, that in this less-than-literate age, the makers of `Mr. Deeds' have found it necessary to trim three words off the original film's title. But the loss of a few words is the least of this film's problems, since `Mr. Deeds' has also jettisoned the subtlety, wit and depth of the earlier film and replaced them with broad slapstick, endless pratfalls and wheezy plot mechanics that better jibe with the undemanding tastes of modern movie audiences.The earlier film featured Gary Cooper as the na?ve country bumpkin who, upon inheriting the fortune of an uncle he never knew he had, journeys to the Big Bad City and shows the people there a thing or two about old fashioned, small town values. The remake retains the general premise of the story, but it has a hard time making a convincing case for those values since Deeds, though we keep being told what a swell guy he is, seems to be guided by a rather questionable moral code, which is that he beats the crap out of anybody he happens not to like. In fact, that seems to be the modus operandi for a number of the people who hail from his hometown of Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire. These violence-prone country rubes don't seem too ethically removed from the callous New York City big shots we're supposed to find so appalling.Maybe it's too much to ask that an Adam Sandler comedy tone down the raucousness a bit, but the pratfalling and mugging do get to be a bit wearying after awhile. Sandler conveys a certain tone of befuddled charm at times and Winona Ryder does a nice turn as the somewhat ditzy reporter who first deceives, then eventually falls in love with this strange man from an alien world, but one only needs to see Cooper and Jean Arthur in the original roles to see how ADULTS would behave in the same circumstances. (In keeping with the semi-literate nature of the times, the Arthur character has been changed from a reporter working for a newspaper to one working for a tabloid TV news program).In fact, every element of the original shines in comparison to its counterpart in this remake. The title is not the only thing here that has been dumbed down.</fullReview>

There was a down home feel to the film, one which brought some nice sensibilities to it, but also had the slap stick comedy that doesn't necessarily have to be vulgar. While this film isn't necessarily the best film Adam Sandler has ever done (which is the Waterboy), it certainly isn't the worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Sandler's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When approaching an Adam Sandler movie, I know what to expect: a load of cheap, silly gags, some of which make hardly a shred of sense. Nevertheless, he's usually funny and I often end up laughing hysterically. "Mr. Deeds" gets off to a very, very slow start. By the time we reach the 30-minute mark, the film picks up the pace a bit. The comedy is hit-or-miss. One of the problems is Adam Sandler tries to be the straight man. Not that he isn't convincing as the straight man; he's no Olivier, but he can keep a straight face. But if I'm watching a Sandler movie--I want Sandler to make me laugh! About the only times he goes for laughs are when he's beating the crap out of someone or hammering people with tennis balls. Most of the funny moments arise from the lovely cameos. Of course, I must first mention the great Steve Buscemi, who steals the show in only a few brief appearances as Crazy Eyes (his name explains it all). He's a complete burn-out and when watching his friend Deeds's funeral on TV he says, "This is Deeds's funeral? I thought this was 'Scooby-Doo.'" Only Buscemi can perfectly deliver that line and make it funny. Sandler regular, Allen Covert, again sports a goofy look as Winona Ryder's perverted, red-headed right-hand man. He also brings a few laughs to the table. I was delighted by Al Sharpton's amusing cameo. Also keep a lookout for Rob Schneider, who reprises his role as the delivery man from "Big Daddy." John Turturro has a few funny moments as the Puerto Rican butler, but I couldn't help but think back to his much-funnier appearance in the Coen Brothers' "The Big Lebowski" as Jesus Quintana. And there's an unconventional woman-to-woman fight scene that's quite hysterical. I'm used to Sandler's low-brow humor, and I'm in no way judging this movie on parallel with "Citizen Kane," but I laughed half as many times as I expected and yes, I was quite disappointed. This is one of Sandler's lesser, lesser works--probably the least. About the only memorable thing about this movie: Winona Ryder has never looked hotter! My score: 5 (out of 10)</fullReview>

Deeds is perhaps a bit out of his depth but determined to keep his small town roots and morals even as company execs and media vultures try to take advantage of him.If you are making a feel good film and have a script that relies on you feeling for the little guy then it is probably a bit of a risk to cast Adam Sadler in the lead role considering how he tends to, well, polarise opinion in his audience. Not to put too fine a point on it but I'm not a massive Sadler fan and for me the establishing scenes where he is laid out as a regular nice guy fell flat because he comes over like an annoying and unconvincing person. The point is he has a heart of gold and doesn't go for all that big city business, insincerity and intelligence stuff. As he sees New York his adventure is a collection of scenes with him dispensing small town wisdom, slapping people who step out of line, getting drunk and so on. It is very basic stuff and sadly it says a lot about the audience that the makers were aiming for, or rather what the makers thing of us ? they think that we think that "good" people are just working Joe's who get drunk, smoke, egging cars and so on and look down on society types. As a result of aiming for this low level, the film is as basic as you like and although it is occasionally amusing it is terribly insincere from start to finish. Those who cannot see the narrative arch from about the first two minutes well, I suppose you are the people that the film is aimed at (no offence).I didn't really expect any better from this but I was still quite bothered by how simplistic, insincere and inane the whole thing is. Sadler matches the film by producing all the same characteristics in his performance. The people who love his dumb "man-child" stuff will love him here but understandably the majority of viewers will find him annoying and grating. He is well supported by all sorts of people who are served by the material in a variety of ways. Turturro is excellent and sneaks his way into stealing every scene he is in. Ryder is basic but appealing. Covert, Gallagher, Harris and Avari all draw the odd laugh but generally are just mugging their way through.Overall this is a very basic comedy that drew maybe two laughs from me and constantly aims for the lowest common denominator in terms of comedy and settles for cloying insincerity in place of a plot. It is dumb stuff that assumes that you and I (the viewers) are dumb too. If you can get past that offence then there sadly isn't a lot of fun or laughter to be had anyway. A pointless remake of a much better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>inDEEDly unwatchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this completely unnecessary and pathetic remake of the classic "Mr. Deeds goes to Town", Adam Sandler stars as Longfellow Deeds a small time business owner who after inheriting a huge sum of money heads for the big city, where Winona Ryder, kleptomaniac that she is, steals his heart as a two-faced reporter.. Director Steven Brill has proved time and time again that he's incompetent and that his ineptitude knows no end with such travesties as Ready to Rumble, the mighty ducks films, and Heavy Weights. This piece of cinematic excrement is no exception. Even the usually great John Turturro is pretty much wasted here. Unfunny, unwatchable, and thoroughly unwatchable.My Grade: D- DVD Extras: 6 Deleted Scenes; 3 featurettes; Dave Matthew music video; Outtake reel; Greeting cards; Filmographies; Theatrical Trailer; and Trailers for "8 Crazy Nights", "Master of Disguise", "Men in Black 2", and "I Spy" (similiar in that they all suck) DVD-Rom: Script to screen; and web-links (one which doesn't work Due to the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003) Easter Egg: highlight the "Mandrake Falls Fire Department Volunteer" symbol for a short clip of Sandler during an orchestra session</fullReview>

His zany and outrageous comedy now seems especially outdated and immature while he tries to succeed in these supposedly more mainstream roles. Sandler still has the same flat and crude backup whose pathetically crude punchlines only occasionally bring a smile to the face for old times' sake. The story is a mixed blend of cliches and feel-good moments that leave the viewer nauseous when considering how "bad boy" Sandler used to be. This guy now thinks that acting silly and stupid is the same as being funny. May all the Sandler=haters of the world rejoice as his end is near.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with Adam Sandler is he plays the same character in every comedy he does. He's always the goofy, dumb, sweet guy who can't get a girl till he meets the hot girl in whatever movie he's in.With this being said, there are some other characters in this film that make it decent. Such as the butler with the foot-fettish and the quarterback. And Peter Gallagher, as the bad guy, is pretty good at being smarmy toward the end when he thinks he owns controlling interest of the company.Winona's good part came when she kicked Jan where the sun don't shine and Jan said Honey, I ain't got balls.FINAL VERDICT: By no means is this a slapstick comedy fest, but it may get some smiles or slight laughs out of you. I recommend it if you are looking for a time waster or brain cell killer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My verdict on this film is it's the worst adam sandler movie I've seen so far. I'm actually an Adam Sandler fan believe it or not. Films like Waterboy, and Happy Gilmore were good films that had a decent story, good jokes and most of all, the characters were unique and likeable (even the bad guys). But in this story it seems like there wasn't much effort put forth. The story is weak, and the little quirks that every Sandler character has seem to be put in there just for the sake of putting it in there (saying "wicked-crazy" or "wicked-awesome" gets on your nerves after a while). The frost-bitten foot and the greeting card writing dream are stupid. The supporting characters are pretty weak too. Wynona Ryder does bad job when it comes to being funny. She really wasn't funny at all. I suppose they were trying to recreate the Drew Barrymore type of role where a character you normally wouldn't think would be in a comedy movie plays a main character. The only thing I think I liked about this movie was when the whole town got Corvettes. Overall I think this movie was pretty bad and not much effort was shown for this movie. Casting was bad too.peace!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler stars as Longfellow Deeds, a tenderhearted hick who unexpectedly inherits his late uncle's $40 billion media empire, while Winona Ryder is a reporter for a tabloid TV show bent on destroying his name. No point in beating around the bush: this joins "Resident Evil" and "Death to Smoochy" as one of the worst movies of the millennium; never mind the year. "Deeds" is a plotless wonder that is merely an excuse for Sandler to go whole-hog with his usual slapstick nonsense along with his usual pitiful ? well, it doesn't even deserve to be called acting. The apathetic script makes light of stalking and assault while attempting to legitimize worthless supporting characters who don't advance whatever minuscule story that exists. While not busy knocking people around (which is okay as long as it's for a good cause), Deeds wants to write Hallmark cards. How precious. Meanwhile, your hope sinks as your brain shrinks, because "Mr. Deeds" truly stinks. Harry Potter and Frodo Baggins, where are you when we really need you? 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't a truly original or funny gag in sight, and even though I'm not a Sandler fan, I expected better. He manages to look completely apathetic in every single scene - some sort of record, I imagine. My favourite actress - the gorgeous Winona Ryder - does a pretty decent job, bless her. There's no doubting though, she looks positively ill throughout most of this movie. Whether it was the court case or the reported drug addictions, or something else I don't know, but she really doesn't look, or sound, like the Winona Ryder I have grown to love. She still easily out-acts the rest of the cast, but I felt sad seeing her: a) look so ill; and b) become desperate enough to take a role in this shameful excuse for a film.This is not a badly made movie, just badly acted for the most part. It looks quite classy, and is technically very competent. But that's no excuse for releasing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pathetic attempt at comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note to Adam Sandler and the makers of MR. DEEDS: when your remake of a film from the 1930s is not as fresh or funny as the original still is today, it might not be a good project. This was, with the possible exception of MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING, the most unfunny "comedy" I saw in the year 2002. Everything that was even mildly amusing was directly lifted from Frank Capra's original, but the moral center of that film was stupidly changed to suit Sandler's questionable style of comedy. It's not that the man hasn't made me laugh in the past (I enjoyed BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE), but this movie is more reminiscent of THE WATERBOY; it tries too hard and fails miserably. The really puzzling thing about the film is why Winona Ryder, John Turturro, Peter Gallagher, Steve Buscemi and Jared Harris would waste their considerable talents in such a pointless, unworthy film. For viewers who want a modern film in the style of old screwball comedies, I humbly recommend the Coens' THE HUDSUCKER PROXY. Don't waste your time on MR. DEEDS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have enjoyed most of Sandler's movies and therefore expected to like this one, too, especially since the word of mouth was good.However, I found it so bad that I stopped watching in the middle.Although every movie takes liberties with reality, some of them go too far. This is one of them, and that's the primary reason I disliked it.To begin with the 82-year-old man who freezes to death at the top of Mt. Everest could not be lifted off by a helicopter. No helicopter ever made can hover at that altitude. There might not even be one that can fly at that altitude.Secondly, Sandler's character reveals a blackened foot that had been severely frostbitten years ago and invites the butler to wail on it with a fireplace poker. He can't feel the pain. Okay, fine, but that doesn't mean beating on the foot with a heavy iron bar wouldn't damage it.Then we see Sandler's character climbing the side of a building to save a woman whose apartment is on fire. How could he possibly be so agile with such a damaged foot? That's a rhetorical question because, of course, he couldn't.Lastly, Winona Ryder's character, a tabloid journalist, poses as an ordinary person in order to get close to Sandler's character and secretly record his activities with a hidden camera. Yet the tape we see was shot from positions she couldn't possibly have been in. (Like three stories high in the case of the apartment fire.)And it defies credibility that Sandler's character doesn't figure out after the first incident that Winona Ryder's character did the taping defies credibility.This movie is a real stinker. I gave it a 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unfunny Mr. Deeds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only Adam Sandler comedy I remember watching is 'Anger Management' which was pretty awful. I know that one shouldn't anything profound from his movies and his kind of comedy doesn't particularly appeal to me. For some reason, I do not know what, I decided to watch 'Mr. Deeds'. Perhaps I expected myself to laugh a little. I should have watched 'Spaced' instead (that was the original plan). The film really drags in the first 45 minutes and the 'comedy' is hardly funny. The chemistry between the lead couple is hardly convincing. The whole romance angle is pretty boring. Sandler seems to be playing a 'nicer' version of himself. Having seen Winona's comic guest appearance in the TV series 'Friends', I would have expected better from her. However, she seems really uncomfortable in the initial reel (ironically the film was just released after the lawsuit against her) and hams in the last half. John Torturro and Peter Gallagher are quite good in their roles. I actually enjoyed Torturro and Sandler's shared scenes. Conchata Ferell was quite funny too. Perhaps it would be a wiser decision to watch something else unless you absolutely have nothing better to do.</fullReview>

He wants Deeds to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home $40 billion richer. However he gets involved with an undercover reporter (Winona Ryder) and Cedar plans to get the company by all possible means.Sandler very much is the nice guy here, not goofy, not bad tempered and hopes to stretch his acting muscles but is still a bit too much of a lovable dork. There are still some gross jokes, some songs and his regular acting friends drop by such as Steve Buscemi and Rob Schneider. John Turtturo stands out as the faithful butler who suddenly sneaks up on you. There are even a few cameos like John McEnroe.The plot is rather flimsy and predictable. The romantic angle does not really work. Sandler is nice but not too funny and as a remake it adds nothing to an original that has been rated very highly for years.

		<shortDescription>Funny movie, like-able characters, positive moral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't too many people like Longfellow Deeds in this world. Deeds is a likable, 'good- guy' from the small town of Mandrake Falls who doesn't let money get in the way of what's really important to him. Its tough not to embrace the charismatic Deeds when life throws him a curveball and his world is turned upside down. Thought it's loosely based off of the 1936 film "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", Steven Brill's film "Mr. Deeds" still comes off as an original comedy with a slight twist. Now don't go to watch this movie expecting an action-packed drama with lots of special effects. Instead, the combination of likable characters, a quirky love-story, and the overall positive moral of the film makes "Mr. Deeds" a favorite at any movie store. Longfellow Deeds may be perhaps the friendliest and most humble character that Adam Sandler has ever played, and the best thing about this role is that it seemed so natural for him. What really makes this film special is the cast of supporting characters such as John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, and Winona Ryder. Turturro plays the humorous and sneaky Emilio, a servant of Deeds while Buscemi plays Crazy-Eyes, a friendly but unusual citizen from Mandrake Falls. Both of these characters liven up the movie and add just a little silliness to the mix. Ryder stars as Babe Bennett, a sexy journalist who tricks Deeds into falling in love with her in order to gather any information she can about him to save her job. The relationship between Babe and Deeds really becomes the focal point of the film, and takes its viewers for quite a ride.The minute that Deeds saves Babe from her staged "mugging", it is obvious that these two will end up falling in love. This brings up one major flaw in the plot: it is way too predictable. This isn't necessarily a negative thing, but some viewers might not enjoy the fact that they can guess what will happen next. When Babe initially goes out with Deeds, she is simply doing it for her job and does her best to fake affection toward him in order to find out more information. As time draws on, Deeds' heartwarming personality grows on her more and more until she realizes she is in love and can't live with the fact that she is lying to him. This creates an interesting chemistry between the two, and it definitely keeps the audience's interest. One of the best parts about this film is that Longfellow Deeds' personality is contagious. It grows not only on his friends in the film, but also grows on his viewers. An important lesson taught in this film is to be happy no matter what you have. Deeds is a prime example of this, as even gaining $40 billion and becoming the richest man in New York doesn't change who he is one bit. In fact, he ends up teaching a room full of greedy stockholders this same exact lesson too. This is what makes "Mr. Deeds" such a fantastic film, seeing a lovable character that stays strong and fights for what he believes in. Having any other actor in the place of Sandler would definitely knock this film down a couple notches. The image Sandler portrays as Longfellow Deeds locks in the audience and makes them begin to care about him, especially as the girl he falls in love with turns out to have been hiding something from him. The twists and turns throughout the movie definitely keep things interesting, especially when things look so hopeless for Deeds that there couldn't be any way out. Anyone who is partial to a heartwarming classic will get a few good laughs and will definitely enjoy "Mr. Deeds".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inconsistent, shallow, and unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is bizarre for me to fathom the idea that Adam Sandler chose the leading role in a remake of a Frank Capra film from 1936 with Gary Cooper as the leading man. As expected, Mr. Deeds isn't a tiresome retread of old material but a tiresome retread through the odds and ends of Sandler's buffoonish schtick, further cementing that despite tackling a wide range of roles, he has yet to adopt a screen presence that he will choose to make tolerable on his audiences.This sits comfortably aside Happy Gilmore, a film I found funny at first, but ultimately, mean-spirited, obnoxious, and overall incredibly unrewarding. But if we're looking at this film as a character study, then this is probably one of the better Sandler characters. Throughout the first few scenes I thought he'd be one of the best, but as soon as Sandler threw punches occupied by horribly unrealistic sound effects that seemed to interrupt the flow of wind and air my optimism deteriorated.At first glance, the premise mildly passable; Preston Blake (Harve Presnell) is a great American businessman running dozens of television and radio stations across the county and has accumulated an inane amount of money throughout his lifetime. After an attempt to climb a mountain results in him freezing to death, those who run portions of Blake's company find that he left all his savings to his nephew, Longfellow Deeds (Sandler). Just call him "Deeds." Deeds comes from a humble town there everyone is polite, understanding, naive, and welcoming to all walks of life. In other words, the world we should live in but do not. When two representatives of Blake's company come to visit Deeds to inform him that his uncle left him $40 billion, they find he is employed at a busy pizzeria and that his biggest ambition is to write greeting cards for Hallmark. Upon informing him of his earnings, Deeds seems shockingly lax and uninterested and when he is taken to his uncle's luxurious apartment it would seem that he has seen hundreds of the same.Overtime, as Deeds begins to somewhat enjoy his fortune, helping others, and making new friends, he becomes acquainted with Winona Ryder's character after she is "mugged" out in the cold streets. She tells Deeds she is "Pam Dawson," a school nurse from "Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa," and the two begin to go out. The one thing she neglects to tell him is that her name is actually Babe Bennett, and she works for a TMZ-like station and tries to dig up dirt on Deeds by carrying around a hidden camera and microphone so that she can return the footage to her boss to rework it into something slanderous. Until she realizes what she is doing "is wrong" and begins to have feelings for the man.Thankfully, the film spares us the ridiculous "man's money goes to his head" clich but instead, gives us enough unnecessary sight gags to fill two films. Consider a scene where Deeds reveals to his butler that when he was younger his right foot became so frostbitten that it lost all remote feeling and turned charcoal-black. We then get an outrageous sequence of the man jumping on, stepping on, and stabbing Deeds' foot in hopes to strike some form of clear emotion.And consider another sequence where Deeds is in the right place at the right time and attempts to save a woman from her burning apartment building, but first must rescue her seven cats. He proceeds to throw them outside of the window so they can land on what appears to be a trampoline held by firefighters and proceed to bounce into the next comedic setup. The whole scene is witless and provided me with some of the most wincing and cringing I've done this year to a film that was a comedy. Consistent readers know I do not tolerate animal abuse in films, especially, when it is done for no good reason. To try and get laughs out of it is sickening.Mr. Deeds could've been a fun, lightweight comedy if it weren't for its tonal inconsistency, its barrage of unnecessary sequences, shallow characters, and cheap plot pitfalls.Starring: Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder, Kathy Bates, Peter Dante, Allen Covert, Rob Schneider, J.B. Smoove, and Harve Presnell. Directed by: Steven Brill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler's Mr Deeds is a modern take on Frank Capra's classic. As I haven't seen the original, I can't form a comparison and this may be just as well.This story of a small-town innocent who inherits a vast fortune (by way of a controlling interest in a multi-national conglomerate) and then wins people over by way of his inherent niceness, showcases some but not all of Sandler's trademarks. Thankfully, it avoids smut, bad language, and loving discussion of private parts. But it dips into violent slapstick, and it drowns in glutinous sentimentality.A good cast is largely wasted (the exception being John Turturro's very funny Emilio). There are smiles but few laughs, and little believability.Pretty typical Sandler from his "family" oriented output.</fullReview>

His one weakness is Winona Ryder as plucky Lois Lane-type reporter who worms her way into his life in order to get a story. The film is utterly devoid of charm, but it has some physical comedy (Sandler beating up on various people) that should make most of you laugh out loud. Sandler is his usual watchable self, and this may explain why such an unnecessary movie raked in almost four times what it cost to make.</fullReview>

Leaving his Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire home, Mr. Sandler is taken to wicked New York City by sneaky Peter Gallagher (as Chuck Cedar), who is plotting to steal Sandler's empire. The business seems loosely based on Rupert Murdoch's FOX corps. Included is a take-off on Bill O'Reilly's old "Inside Edition" (as "Inside Access") show with Jared Harris (as Mac McGrath) essaying the oily host. He assigns muckraker Winona Ryder (as Babe Bennett) to bring in the dirt on Sandler...Things get complicated when a certain couple falls in love. Leading the class at Sandler's richly decorated townhouse is manservant John Turturro (as Emilio Lopez). He has a foot fetish and Sandler has an invulnerable "black foot" which can be beaten severely. Sandler possesses super-hero powers. He saves people with Spider-Man climbing and his Superman foot. Though rated PG-13, this re-make of the more adult-oriented "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" (1936) has humor which will appeal mostly to even younger viewers. The part about "Winchestertonfieldville" is cute and the New York City photography by Peter Lyons Collister is nice.**** Mr. Deeds (6/28/02) Steven Brill ~ Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder, John Turturro, Peter Gallagher</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this is really not the strongest movie of Sandler. It is getting really cheesy. Especially the end makes you feel like the movie was done for kids or ultra-low IQ club. I usually like Sandler's work. He delivers a nice message and a nice funny movie but this time it is really at the edge. Some nice jokes and nice music saved this movie and raised to the level of average but that is it. I am not even talking about the predictability and originality of the plot. I don't criticize comedy movies because of these stuff since comedy movies should make you laugh. But if they can barely deliver the smile like this one, I count the movie as a failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie like that has never been made before.We've got a love story. Millions of dollars and a huge unsuspected twist in the story. It's small town America showing the cold NY city what life is really about. Everything packed in an extremely funny package. You'll be all like "No...HE DIIIIIDN't!".Friendship, love and remaining true to oneself.Mr. Deeds is the kind of guy you will find in every town of small town America. This movie is not a waste of time at all. It will enrich your life for years to come. It's people showing off real feelings in a plastic world where everything seemed to be about money.The soundtrack is obviously influenced by great composers such as John Williams and reaches your core with every note.God bless the U.S.A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kudos to The Script !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>what does this comedy have and others don't ? I'll tell you. The smart choice of funny, nearly weird, details, like (Adam Sandler)'s black rigid foot, (John Turturro)'s spooky sudden moves. This collection of creatively witty supporting characters (a fighter mom, a crazy Steve Buscemi,.. etc). So this nonstop comic situations that utilized all of that with the lead in enjoyable way (rescuing the cats then the fake TV report about it, the church scene..). Despite that the story is somehow old and formulaic (read : predictable) but it got some surprises along the way (the best of them is at the end). Yet, I respected the most the way this lovely script dealt with what could be so usual, so tame scenes by giving them a magical cinematic touch to be that lively and distinct (the first face-to-face meeting between Winona Ryder and Sandler's mom turns into cat fight, the confession of the lover girl to the lead takes place while she's sinking in a frozen lake,.. ).I'm not a hardcore fan of (Sandler), and here he was carrying on with establishing his customary persona as violent childish good guy. But hands down, he managed to do it very well; being as simple and spontaneous as his character, making this movie as an icon amongst his other many works. (Ryder) wasn't equal, missing her marked natural beauty, being a bit frigid, and sure the most languid in the middle of this cast. (Turturro) delivered what's got to be one of the best butlers ever appeared in movies (wicked remark : observe how they put his picture on the movie's authentic poster with Sandler while no one else is around even the female lead of it!). He reassures again that he's god's gift to comedy, but whether he's the last to know or maybe the producers, stupidly, aren't interested, because I don't see him capitalizing on this talent much ! Director (Steven Brill) handled his job plain and clever, I think he has a brilliant sense of comedy himself, and I suspect that he was told that this comedy, as the current trend nowadays, must have Nudity, so he gave them the nudity they wanted (watch carefully what I love to think as a slap in the producers' face !).Overall, it's rare to be entertained out of contemporary American comedy, however this one did it, and without resorting to today's easy solution "making' um filthy !" as we're living in an age where the term "American comedy" has become naturally another word for "bad taste"! It even got a nice message about truthful poor man in a liar world (the media, the rich people, ..) where truthfulness always means love, and how the movie rewards this love by pushing it to be complete and to win the world's fortune as well in one unforgettably dreamy, outrageously happy ending. I believe it'll be a TV, DVD, VHS classic in the near future, if it's not already. In one word: if this movie got a secret then it's how it paid great attention to the element that lots of Hollywood flicks don't : The Holy Screenplay?Way to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes funny, but rarely, making it one of the lacklustre films starring Sandler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember more than once in high school, I got to see some of this film, but never the entire thing. Sometimes, when supply teachers were in, it was getting close to holidays, etc., movies would often be used as time killers in some classes, even though there often wasn't enough time to finish them. Anyway, I do not recall enjoying what I saw too much, but that was a few years ago, and my tastes have changed a bit since then. So, yesterday, I rented this remake of the 1936 comedy, "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", so I could finally watch it from start to finish. However, it still didn't make me laugh much.Preston Blake is an 82 year old multi-billionaire business owner who sadly freezes to death on Mount Everest during a daring adventure, without a will. An investigation shows that Longfellow Deeds, Blake's long-lost nephew, is his nearest relative. Deeds is a pizzeria owner and poet in the small community of Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire who is very popular with the town. Chuck Cedar and Cecil Anderson visit Deeds in Mandrake Falls and tell him the story. They then take him to New York City, where he can claim his fortune, and they can get him to sign over Blake Media. Unfortunately for Deeds, life is not as easy for him in this big city, as he is not respected by everybody here. A reporter named Babe Bennett goes undercover as a school nurse named Pam Dawson, making Deeds fall in love with her by having him rescue her from a fake theft, and begins to go out with him so she can get good news stories. However, she actually finds herself falling in love with Deeds for real, and her boss, Mac McGrath, is editing the footage he gets of the Mandrake Falls resident to make him look bad! I must confess, I've never seen the original "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town". In fact, I didn't even know this 2002 film was a remake until after I rented it. Since the original is so widely praised, I intend to see it eventually, but for now, I'm just going to have to judge this remake (which seems to be generally considered far inferior) solely as a comedy, not in comparison to the 1936 effort. Well, as a comedy, it does have occasional funny moments. I found that Deeds getting the butler to beat his permanently frostbitten foot, where he can't feel, was fairly amusing, and at least I can't think of anything revolting in it, unlike some of the gags in "Eight Crazy Nights", an animated feature starring Adam Sandler which came out the same year as this, but gagwise, I found this one rather forgettable. The humour in this film is pretty much mediocre, and perhaps sometimes just a bit TOO silly. I can't think of many good examples, other than the fight between Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder) and Jan (Conchata Ferrell).One thing in this movie that impressed me at times was the soundtrack, featuring songs such as "Island in the Sun" from Weezer, and "Sing" from Travis. However, I wasn't impressed with much else. I guess the story and certain happenings were interesting at times, but after watching it, it seems pretty dull in my memory. Maybe die-hard Sandler fans would find 2002's "Mr. Deeds" amusing, but he's definitely been in better comedies during his career (though I suppose he's been in worse as well, such as "Eight Crazy Nights", and the apparently horrendous "Going Overboard", a comedy which I haven't seen) and I highly doubt this 2002 remake will be remembered too well at all decades from now, unlike the original "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", which still seems to be considered a classic today, over seventy years after it was first released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found it possible to purchase my DVD at an unusually low price. That is not a comment on its depth or quality. Of the few Winona I have, this is my favourite since Heathers, something to rank alongside it, suggesting that there might be more that fits my taste as well as these two. I find Beetle Juice to be a fun snack, but the end dance after she got back from her school day at St Shannon's was not my sort of happy ending. Other Winona I have feels geared to a mature taste, not my true ideal. * This has some rough insides. I suspect that some people will have been put off from considering watching this by the more putrid aspects that are shown in the 'making of'. In practice I found those blended in when viewed in the context of the feature. They say nothing about the feel of the movie. Not the problem I had expected this to be. Only a problem if highlighted in advertising. I was swept along by Winona's charisma, her approach to humour, the whole thing. The story even having a proper happy ending as well as fun insides. Kyrat. I like the comment of 10 October 2006 by kyrat as it tells stuff about the original in a way that clicks. I disagree with the comparison to this version and maybe the comment of 6 July 2006 by vchimpanzee can help there, it giving a label of 'Live Action Cartoon'. Sadler's Longfellow Deeds is not a Garry Cooper but a cartoon figure, something akin to Tom or Jerry with a touch of Batman. Winn Dixie has a way with rats. Kyrat understanding the social comment to be superficial compared to the original. I experienced 2002 as the start of politics where those obviously weak are swept under the carpet, akin to a knockout contest. I do not know what happened to those less obviously weak, but the look of our town changed fairly quickly. I find this live action cartoon, full of cartoon figures, released in 2002, as not to be dismissed, it is genuine and sorely needed entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprise was the first reaction I had following one of the funniest films of 2002. Surprise was followed by joy as I learned that the 2002 version of "Mr. Deeds" contained an outstanding performance from an actor known only for his comedy, a story that has as much heart as jokes and a cast that works so well together it was difficult to tell where real life ended and the acting began.Comedy is the main course and romance was served as dessert on a menu that allowed the audience to take two hours and enjoy the feast provided by Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder, Peter Gallagher, Allen Covert, Steve Buscemi and John Turturro as they delivered non-stop comedy.With every great comedy there is a comedian who reigns victorious as he leads the charge to entertain audiences with comedic wit and charm; "Mr. Deeds" is no exception since Sandler accomplishes this task within the first 10 minutes. With the box-office success Sandler brought to films such as "Big Daddy," "The Waterboy" and "The Wedding Singer," I knew that "Mr. Deeds" would bring greater success. The most impressive aspect of the film was the presence of Sandler as he gave the BEST performance of his career.Along with his jokes, Sandler brought a surprise; versatility. Known exclusively for his comedic talents, Sandler brought much more including the ability to become a romantic lead and perform the role with conviction. Furthermore, Sandler was able to portray a character that everyone can sit back in awe.Behind every great romantic lead there is an outstanding actress, which makes the romantic aspect of the film, so much better. It was a brilliant move for the casting directors to get Ryder to play opposite Sandler because she is one of the main reasons "Mr. Deeds" works. She has always amazed audiences with her beauty, charm and immense talent, so when I found out she was attached to this film my face lit up because she gives 110 percent effort in each role.Watching these actors brought a smile to my face because they were well-cast and each brought their brand of humor to the film and played very well off Sandler. With the addition of Buscemi and Covert, "Mr. Deeds" came alive as they come together to create the magic they brought to prior works with Sandler such as "Big Daddy" and "The Wedding Singer. Their familiarity with each other shows as they feed off each other very well.I will admit that "Mr. Deeds" contains a plot that has become clich and makes me yearn for better creativity and originality. However, it was put together well and got me interested from the start.Overall, the script contains a sweet story that will leave everyone smiling and applauding because it does not attempt to do more than make you laugh. "Mr. Deeds" did accomplish this goal and added much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first laid my sights on this movie at Hollywood Video, I thought it would be yet another Sandler film like Anger Management and The Waterboy, with lots of foul mouth language and dirty, crude humor; the kind of film I was in the mood for that night. When I finished watching the movie, I said to myself "Holy Hell, that was so corny and pathetic. WHERE DID THE ADULT HUMOR GO?" I mean honestly, the b*****d Steven Bell should have hired, J**us, I don't know! Maybe a drama king like Tobey McGuire or Christian Slater, but oh, hell no! He hired Adam Sandler, comedy superstar! Anyway, this movie is about Longfellow Deeds; a gullible, selfless man who inherits $40,000,000.00 from the uncle he never knew before that he had. So he flies to The Big Apple (NYC) to sign a few papers and inherited the money. Soon, he meets a journalist named Babe Bennett who disguises herself as a school nurse by the name of Pam Dawson, falls in love with her, and all of a sudden the movie that was SUPPOSED to be comedy turns into a F****N' romantic drama! I HATE ROMANCE! Please, don't be a brainless f**k like me and watch the movie. If you see it in a video store, give it the finger and move on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic Sandler Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mr. Deeds" features the "versatile comic genius" of Adam Sandler as a countryside rube who somehow inherits $60 billion from his estranged uncle ("I didn't know I had an uncle")'s will, and travels to the Big Apple to tangle with ruthless city slickers and corporate thieves out to bereave him of his fortunes. In a film that is rife with bland formula (lowly innocent receives fortune, spends as he pleases, hires eccentric, yet amiable butler, meets girl, falls in love, discovers she only digs him for her profession and his money, loses fortune to villain (Peter Gallagher), reclaims fame and fortune through emotionally connecting to avaricious board members, falls back in love, is a renowned hero and stud), it's unlikely your going to admire this film for originality, or even charm, for this is simply an enticing concept executed with a bland formula that is hardly buoyed by the dismal acting of Sandler and Wyona Ryder, and certainly lacks any wit and ingenuity in its screenplay. To keep it pithy, "Mr. Deeds" is about as original and charming as white plaster on a wall. And it even exhausts itself of decent material after awhile, an awfully indolent flow of ideas, if you ask me! Despite his noble intentions, couldn't Deeds spend more of his billions on whims rather than charity (hey, it's supposed to be an amusing comedy, and what's the fun in seeing a "regular billionaire"?). Yet, for all of its many deficiencies, there are some bearable elements to be found here. The scenes with the butler (John Tuturro) are fairly amusing (especially when he hammers Deeds' peculiar foot), and are the comedic height of the film. Hey, even the scene with Deeds outfoxing the Wall Street tycoons in the end is, only a few $billion short of inspiring. Yet, most of "Mr. Deeds" is rife with formula, cloying gags, implausibility, and is essentially a typical Sandler circus, featuring (you guessed it) many of his costars from previous films. I have yet to view the original 1939 classic from which this drek is inspired, yet I am certain this is a travesty of a classic concept in comparison with that film. If you enjoy routine Sandler humor, Sandler material, Sandler formula, and Sandler resolutions, then you'll find this comedy "delightfully funny". For anyone else, this is simply a cinematic ally and intellectually "bankrupt" billionaire romp with few moments of appraisal and interest. Avoid "Mr. Deeds"; see the original instead: I'm sure it is leaps and bounds better than this! *1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light-hearted, predictable but ultimately fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSIt must be hard at times for Adam Sandler. Every year the guy releases a movie and whilst he's no doubt rich off it, every feature gets constantly insulted and criticised. People seem to chastise Sandler's films for being low brow, but what actually is the problem with this? Adam Sandler is a master at creating these feel good movies which we watch and just make us all feel happy. That is the beauty of Adam Sandler movies, and the same is true with his remake of Capra's "Mr Deeds Goes To Town".In "Mr Deeds", Sandler takes the Gary Cooper role as Longfellow Deeds, small town boy who inherits a fortune and travels to New York. Meeting journalist Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder), Deeds falls for her cover role of Pam Dawson. By the end of the film, things might turn out as we predict, but ultimately, we come away with a smile on our face.As Deeds, Adam Sandler is excellent. As a more normal character than some of his other roles ("Little Nicky" and "The Waterboy" for example), Sandler thrives as he teaches everyone in New York, the truth about life.Opposite Sandler, even Ryder is enjoyable. Whilst not an actress I'm particularly fond of, as the modern version of Babe Bennett, Ryder provides a simple comedy role and we actually feel sympathy for her at a few points. It feels a shame that Ryder will remain famous for her offscreen problems with the law rather than her decent onscreen performances. Ultimately though, it is her own fault and no doubt something Ryder feels upset about.As well as the main two characters, this film has some brilliant support characters. With actors like Turturro, Gallagher and Buschemi this film has a wonderful supporting cast which thrives and encourages Sandler to produce one of his finest works.Ultimately, the one thing which is most surprising from this film, and also perhaps one of the worst parts of the film is the brief cameo by John McEnroe. Whilst it is amusing to see Sandler and McEnroe get drunk and throw eggs at cars, McEnroe is truely awful as an actor and should be embarrassed at his attempt in acting.In summary, with a cast who performs well, and some magical jokes, "Mr Deeds" is a quality film. Whilst it might not be as good as the original, this film achieves exactly what it wants to. "Mr Deeds" is a brilliant comedy which makes us laugh, it makes us smile, and ultimately it makes us feel good about ourselves. For a quiet relaxing night, little else should be required.</fullReview>

All the lame jokes about feet, including the terrible scene that went on and on about his diseased foot, were at best disgusting. The corporate boardroom scenes were swift-kicked and lacking in interaction and dynamics.

		<fullReview>Making comedy is a serious business (ironic, isn't it?!) I mean, making people laugh isn't easy; `Mr. Deeds' is a must-follow guide.to what comedy SHOULD NOT BE!!! I really don't know where to start, firstly the plot is so weak and predictable: A wanna-do-good-to-you all guy from Little Town who, by fat chance, happens to be the one and only heir of a 40 billion media Co. Come on! We have seen the same freaking thing a thousand times, has this people run out of ideas or what? It is load with the same rusty jokes and a fully predictable development of the story. Besides there are a lot of huge gaps on the plot that even the end seems completely out of place; I am not going to give the end away for those ones who want to see this film (by the way, may God be with you when doing so) but there is a piece of `hard evidence' which wipes out the little credibility of this poor script. The worst part of it is that such evidence is a key factor to save the Media Company from being tear apart for its sale by the pitiless capitalistic partners (Oh dear! I forgot to mention those guys!!) Another crying mistake is the cast, it is now official Winona Ryder has no range what so ever for comedy, she's so out of place in this film it is so NOT her. One shoplifting incident and now she's got to pay for it for the rest of her professional life!!! I hope those clothes worth it!!! After seeing this movie I find hard to believe that Adam Sandler was once part of the Saturday Night Live cast, what happened to this guy's talent? He should be back to this show for a couple of seasons to study again the essentials of good comedy.WARNING: Due to the natural failure of this film's plot viewer discretion is advised, watch it at your own risk. Not suitable for young audiences and those ones looking to have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The old and very rich Mr. Preston Blake dies and Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) inherits all his money and 49% of the shares of Blake's company, which makes him the largest stockholder. Two executives from the company, Cedar (Peter Gallagher) and Anderson (Erick Avari), try to make sure Deeds doesn't want his shares in the company so they can own it themselves. Deeds lives in Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire and needs to come to New York for some paperwork. Deeds is a friendly guy, someone who wants to be friends with everybody, well, almost everybody. Once he arrives in New York John Turturro is his servant.Winona Ryder plays Babe, a tabloid reporter who must find out who inherits everything from Mr. Blake, and after she has done that she must come up with more stories. Of course Deeds meets Babe, who calls herself Pam Dawson, because she must be the love interest in the movie. They have dinner and Babe does nothing but lie to Deeds, something that must be made up later in the story after he discovers everything. Although Babe lies to him for her story she instantly likes him. After a night of partying together with John McEnroe in a nice cameo, where Babe has recorded everything, the whole country can see what Deeds has done all night. The next day Babe does it again only this time the editors mess with her footage. Where Deeds actually saved the day they made it look like he did terrible things. Of course this is the real turning point for Babe and the way she thinks of Deeds, and in way of how she thinks of herself. The problem is that she didn't tell Deeds and we all know how these stories develop and there is no need to say more here about the story. We know it all ends well, how exactly is not even important.I said that Deeds wants to be friends with almost everybody. The once he doesn't want to be friends with he treats very violent. Some of the violent scenes are pretty funny but there is a scene with his own foot, a foot that feels nothing, that is more sick than funny. Still, the violent numbers in the movie gave me some great laughs. There are other moments of comedy but most them did involve some kind of pain; fighting, falling down, etc.Adam Sandler is not my favorite actor in the world, and sometimes I had some problems with him as the leading actor. He is great in the violent scenes, as he was in 'Happy Gilmore' but as an actor I just don't like him very much. The lovely Winona Ryder makes up for this. Other great things are the little supporting roles. Like I said we have John McEnroe in a nice cameo, Peter Gallagher is good as the villain, John Turturro terrific as the servant with a foot fetish and we see Steve Buscemi in a little performance who steals every scene he is in.As a remake of Frank Capra's 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town' it could have gone completely wrong. The new 'Mr. Deeds' is not a great movie with its predictable story, but it certainly has some good moments and a heart in the right place. If you like Adam Sandler you will definitely like this movie, if you are not very fond of him, like myself, you probably find enough other little things to enjoy this movie in a certain way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was wary of seeing "Mr. Deeds" for two reasons--one, because it had gotten dismal reviews in the paper; and two, I hadn't (actually, I still haven't) seen the original version directed by Capra and was wondering if I had made a mistake by seeing the Sandler version instead. But, I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. I liked the movie a lot. Quite a funny experience, it was. Come on, everyone, lay off Adam Sandler. Sure, he may not be Woody Allen, but he's funny in his own way and knows how to make an enjoyable flick. But I must say, the real scene-stealer in the film was John Tutorro as the butler--he was hilarious. Watch Mr. Deeds if you like Sandler--(it was certainly better than Big Daddy).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Sandler find another story line?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will keep this short and sharp - it is the same as any other Adam Sandler film. The plot - bloke who lives the simple life, has a bit of good fortune and then comes. My kids really enjoyed it (I think this is where the audience lies for this type of film - pre-teenagers). There are some funny moments - it is worth watching but is it time for Mr Sandler to find a new script writer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an underated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the review I wasn't expecting much, but what a pleasant movie. John Turturro deserved an oscar nomination for best supporting actor for his role as the butler who has a thing about feet. Unfortunately, the academy views roles (and movies) like this as too silly to warrant a nomination. Steve Buschemi, in a minor role as crazy eyes, was absolutely hilarious and Adam Sandler was....well, he was Adam Sandler. Even John McEnroe, who I usually find distasteful, was terrific in a perfect role as himself.It's a totally silly comedy, but do yourself a favor (when you're in the right mood) and watch Mr. Deeds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely juvenile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy you'll probably enjoy Adam Sandler's latest, Mr. Deeds. If you enjoy people falling down, bad poetry, and spastic colon jokes, then yes, this movie may be for you. If you still laugh at the same things that cracked you up when you were fourteen, then this movie is for you. Everyone else, though, should take note that Mr. Deeds is extremely juvenile, and while it raises the occasional laugh, they are too few and far between to qualify calling this film a comedy. Cult actors John Turturro and Steve Buscemi are both memorable in quirky roles that showcase their comedic sides. As Emilio the Butler, Turturro delivers his lines with the timing of a master, and makes great use of sight gags. He's a scene stealer. Buscemi plays the pizza-loving Crazy Eyes, continuing his tradition of cameo appearances in Sandler's films. I can't figure out what happened to Winona Ryder here. It's almost like she has forgotten how to act. As love interest Pam Dawson she turns in one of the worst onscreen performances of the year. I don't want to kick her while she's down, but for someone as accomplished as she is, this is truly awful work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I though Mr.Deeds was another tragic Hollywood movie, and it is that too. But there is something special about it that makes it ok, for the klisches are so personified in the characters and so obvious in the plot that even though you know what will happen and even though you think you have seen it all before, it is different. During the film, you will notice people having extraordinary abilities, more like moderate supermenn or X-men or similar, but this is used in a brilliant way to make the characters special and not stupid. And the one i liked most is the extremly sneaky servant. Still its not a movie that gives you anything except a good laugh and a smile at the end. A perfect family movie in every way, i give it 6-7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie some people will hate, while others will just love it. I belong to the latter. This movie is highly entertaining and funny, even though also highly predictable and full of clichs. The plot is a mixture of things you have seen many times before, except for a few details. One of those being the rather strange and mysterious but very funny servant, brilliantly played by John Turturro. To some this movie will probably seem stupid and meaningless, they will probably say that there is nothing new in it and that it is too predictable. But, to me, that is exactly what makes it a relaxing, funny feel-good movie. It is also romantic, warm and charming, it has an important message and the comedy is brilliantly made.</fullReview>

A tabloid journalist then goes undercover to make him look bad, but finds herself falling in love with him instead. Certainly a new outfit for Adam Sandler, but nevertheless Mr. Deeds provides good laughs, a bit of romance, and a number of great supporting characters (including an especially funny few scenes with John Macenro!) 6.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great comedy in my opinion, 'Mr. Deeds' brings back all the elements that made Adam Sandler famous for. If you are not a Sander fan, this movie ain't gonna make you one now, but if you enjoyed Adam's previous work, you're gonna have a few good laughs.'Mr. Deeds' isn't as good a movie as Sandler's best work ('Happy Gilmore', 'The Wedding Singer', 'The Waterboy'), as the story is quite predictable and the romantic element isn't strong enough. But still, there are classic Adam Sandler jokes and John Torturro as well as Steve Buscemi bring brilliant performances.The only disappointing thing in the movie is the 'Monopoly guy' joke. It was already done Adam...So kind of a mixed bag, but still good enough for all Adam Sander fans.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a look in for the burning cat sequence alone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch a movie, you suspend certain disbeliefs depending on what sort of movie it is. For example, a fantasy movie makes you suspend disbelief in magic and monsters. Likewise horror flicks make you suspend disbelief in the fact that, when threatened with death, a group of people will naturally split up and wander about alone.So I'm a bit puzzled that some people, when watching a comedy movie, can't suspend disbelief in things like helicopters flying at altitude or people with a numb foot being able to climb. Sure. Those things are silly. And in a serious film they would rightly be slated as such. But in a comedy, their very silliness shouldn't be used as an excuse to rubbish the movie.I was dreading Mr Deeds when I sat down to watch it. I don't really like Adam Sandler that much and the prospect of a whole film starring him was frightening. But I was rather pleasantly surprised. Yes, the whole movie is ridiculously silly. But that is the whole point of it.Sandler does, as someone noted, have a rather limited selection of comic roles he seems able to play. All his characters are socially inept in some way, and Longfellow Deeds is no exception. But that aside, he manages a decent performance here. In fact, so do all the cast, with the exception of John Mackenroe, who mercifully has only a couple of minutes screen time.All in all it's a funny enough movie to pass away a couple of hours watching. If you hate Adam Sandler, you'll hate the film, but otherwise it's worth a look in for the burning cat sequence alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I can't believe this movie got such a low score. I was expecting something around a 8, and was shocked to find out it was a 5.7. Some people were commenting that the movie was so bad that they could not finish it. Well, they all should go watch "The Piano" or some other boring drama movie. This movie was funny as hell to me. Although it seemed that Adam Sandler himself was not the funniest part of the movie, everything made it into a very good, funny movie. One of the funniest people was the servant, John Turturro. He was "very, very sneaky". I was surprised by the fact it had a good romantic touch to it. Winona Ryder looked great in the film. She is a very good actress. Anyway, I still can't believe the low rating of this film with like over 4,000 votes. That just proves that I can't always base what I'll like on what others think. In my opinion, this was one of the 10 funniest movies I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of movies. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great comedy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I know that this sounds heretical to some of you who enjoyed the original. I also know that a lot of Sandler fans were disappointed because this wasn't what they expected from him. But not having seen any other Sandler movies myself, and having specifically seen the original before renting his version, I have to say that it's better.Perhaps I should qualify that a bit. His version is better for our times. The original version was probably very good for the 30s and 40s, but there are a number of things in it that are extremely grating to a modern audience, not the least of which is the entire sequence when Longfellow Deeds is at a hearing to determine his sanity - a sanity which is in doubt merely because he doesn't share the values of the rest of the rich and powerful in Manhattan. While it might have been believable to audiences then that a person could be declared insane for acting on small town values in the big city, it is not at all believable to modern audiences, and the producers of Sandler's version wisely left that out, choosing to turn the plot in other ways.I found the remake much easier to follow than the original. Of course, this could also be due to the fact that having already seen the original, I had an idea of what to expect. It would be interesting to have someone who's never seen the original watch Sandler's version first and then the original, and see which was easier to follow.To those who object to Sandler's character seeming to punch out anyone he didn't like, it should be remember that Gary Cooper's character did the exact same thing, and that *both* versions of the character could've behaved with a little more maturity.Frankly, I think that this version was a good telling of the Mr Deeds story in a * modern* setting, and shows what someone a little bit like one of us would've done in similar circumstances. The original has its charms, but it's about a different time.Three thumbs up from our family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mr. Deeds" is Adam Sandler's weakest comedy (a view that might have to be altered when I see "8 Crazy Nights"-which looks awful). Many of the jokes in this remake of the Frank Capra classic seem underdeveloped and disturbingly, unnecessarily violent. Sandler himself seems to be going through the motions in this film. Winona Ryder is sadly miscast and misused-she is the worst part of the film. The film is saved and made enjoyable by John Turturro (who steals so many scenes he should be arrested). The "sneaky" butler that Turturro plays is the best part of this film. Watch this film for a silly, easy-on-the-eyes-and-ears comedy, but if you want a superior comedy from Sandler rent the now-classic "Happy Gilmore" or "The Wedding Singer". Heck, you might as well go see "Punch-Drunk Love" (that looks like a masterpiece).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandler Strikes Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, "Little Nicky" was a hit-or-miss comedy. Sandler took a year off to do other things. Some think he fell off after "Nicky". But no, he's back with "Mr. Deeds!" It's a hilarious movie with heart that you can actually take the whole family to without having the young one ask "Why were they laughing after they ate that chocolate cake?" [From Little Nicky]Now there are are a bunch of Sandler-ites who are p***ed off that Adam's not the same. He's not doing Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison. But that's not fair. Sandler's a few years shy of 40. He wants to challenge himself. He can pull out a Gilmore/Madison anytime he wants to. He just wants to go in other directions. If he'd made sequels to those classics, we'd probably see him on "Just Shoot Me." [Sorry Spade, you just haven't found the vehicle to showcase your abilities]Yes, he's playing the same "Misunderstood Nice Guy", but it doesn't really matter to me. What matters is if it brings laughter to a crappy day. And it does. I'm not going to reiterate the story here because you can read it at the main page. Let's just say John Tuturro deserves a Golden Globe nomination for his role as the 'sneaky sneaky' butler "Emilio". He's so funny and likable that you'll remember him for quite some time. We haven't seen Winona in a goofy comedy like this before, and she fits right in. Buscemi drops in for a few scenes. Not as funny as his role in "Wedding Singer", but a little Buscemi don't hurt!Everyone in this movie wants to make you laugh. Now to the critics --What's the harm in making someone laugh? It's not like it's "Rush Hour" comedy where the main characters viciously make fun of each others backgrounds for everyone's amusements.Adam's made another funny movie. I can't wait to see Punch Drunk Love to see him...dare I say it...ACT. Although not as gut-busting as "Happy Gilmore" (my favorite Sandler film), it accomplishes what it sets out to do. Definetely one for the DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I have a lot to say about the flicks I see. This one, I don't really have much to say except for SEE IT. This movie totally rocks!! It is funny and sweet. Adam Sandler is such a babe in this movie. Normally I don't go for him, but he won my heart in this flick. Winona "Noni" Ryder gives her usual good performance. It's nice to see her in a comedy for once. And the always wonderful Steve Buscemi is not one to be missed.This movie is one of the few Sandler flicks that doesn't hit you in the head with stupid humor. There are a few decent laughs.Trust me. You'll enjoy it. 4 and a half stars out of five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of Adam Sandler, so I was excited about the release of "Mr Deeds". His quirky sense of humour is only something that can be tolerated by true AD fans, so I was looking forward to having a good laugh. Although there was some great humour in it, it really didn't live up to the expectations that I had. It's great to see Adam Sandler try and break into a sort-of serious role but it didn't have it's intended effect. Winona Ryder was good as Babe Bennett but I thought her character fell in love with Longfellow Deeds a bit too fast, it was like they just wanted to hurry their 'love' story up. It was good to see the return of his usual partners in crime (Allen Covert, Steve Buscemi etc) but I think this movie could have had the potential to have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deedy deedy doo! Deede deedy dumb! That was my expectations of the new Adam Sandler flick `Mr. Deeds'. However, I did not expect to get a good deed from the filmmakers of the quite comical and heartwarming `Mr. Deeds'. The film is a remake of the old Jimmy Stewart film: `Mr. Deeds Goes to Town'. Adam Sandler stars as a small town warmhearted simpleton who suddenly inherits a billion dollars. Adam Sandler `deelights' us with his bittersweet performance. Unfortunately, Winona Ryder doesn't exactly steal the show (maybe the store instead) as the manipulative tabloid reporter who does steal Mr. Deed's heart instead. However, the real scene-stealer character pupil of `Mr. Deeds' is Steve Buscemi as the boisterously entertaining `crazy eyes'. You have to see it to believe it! Do your good deed of the day, and take a friend to meet `Mr. Deeds'. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mr. Deeds" is one of those movies you see just to have a good time. This is one of the typical Adam Sandler movies, his kind of jokes, with his kind of strange campy situations. I think the good thing about all this is that Sandler has defined a unique comedy style, however ridiculous it can get. Unique after all. Anyway, I still think the funniest Adam Sandler movie is "Happy Gilmore". This one comes close to a runner up.One of the things that makes "Mr. Deeds" a little bit different than the other Sandler movies is John Turturro. He did a very good job as the supporting character Emilio; he's the funniest guy in the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on my birthday (which was the day it came out) &amp; I loved it! I haven't laughed that hard since "Little Nicky" (in my opinion the BEST Adam Sandler movie to date). Even my mom laughed all through it &amp; she HATES Adam Sandler.Okay, this is the plot: When an aging billionare dies while climbing Mt. Everest, his employees start working overtime to find a relative since he died unmarried with no children. They come up with Longfellow Deeds who lives in a VERY small town somewhere in New Hampshire. When they go out to find him, they discover he's working in a pizza shop &amp; writes greeting cards &amp; has no interest with 40 Billion Dollars. But still, he goes with them to New York to claim his fortune. When the press gets wind of it, a tabloid t.v. show host puts Bebe Bennet in charge of finding out all she can about him. So she poses as Rose Dawson, a school nurse claiming she came from a small town. Deeds starts falling in love Pam/Bebe, &amp; even brings her to the small town she claims she's from.The funniest characters in the movie has to be Emilio &amp; Crazy Eyes.Crazy Eyes: Time heals all. Mr. Deeds: Really? Crazy Eyes: I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to that squirrel over there. (points to a mountain goat.)And there is a twist ending you'll never see coming.

		<fullReview>Sandler's latest shtikfest got some of the pummelingest reviews of the summer--and really it's no more than a lightly likable, not all that funny pseudo-Capra cornjerker, and more adept at its populist yank than, say, Frank Darabont's excruciating THE MAJESTIC. Sandler is the small-town good guy roped into forty billion dollars by some evil big-city swells (like a criminally overqualified Peter Gallagher). He meets a reporter (a radiant Winona Ryder) who schnookers him, then falls in love with him, then undergoes a nastily sadistic--don't want to quite go there and say "misogynistic" --series of punishments for duping Mr. Nice Guy. It's nice that Sandler makes room for excellent actors like John Turturro and Steve Buscemi to have their little time-outs of comic biz. It's nice that he generally "overcasts" all over the place. But in the end, that's all it is--and one recalls David Ogden Stiers' famously sarcastic injunction, "It's NICE to be NICE to the NICE!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could have been a lot better, but it could have been a whole lot worse. The first twenty minutes or so of this movie weren't funny at all, and I was afraid this was a sign of things to come. But, thankfully, Adam Sandler does what he usually does: acts like an idiot and gets laughs. John Turturro is hilarious as Mr.Deed's butler, and some little old guy who was only in the movie for around two minutes was hysterical, too. However, the whole movie wasn't great. Winnona Ryder (if that's how you spell it) gives the worst performance in the history of anything. I mean, I know this movie wasn't meant to be Citizen Kane or anything, but good lord!! She was horrible! The touchy dramatic moments were pretty pathetic, mostly do to Ryder's equally lousy perfomance. I know that this movie is a remake of the Capra movie "Mr.Deeds Goes To Town", and so instantly people are comparing this movie to the original. Every critic I've heard talks about how horrible of a remake this movie is. OF COURSE IT IS! We're talking about ADAM SANDLER redoing a movie by (whatever his first name is) CAPRA! Anyone who thinks that this movie is supposed to be a sincere remake of the original should be smacked without mercy. The idea that anyone, anywhere, ever would look down on this movie because it isn't as kind hearted as the first only proves what true idiots they really are. Rodger Ebert said that this movie was horrible because it was like an insult rather than a remake. Hey, Pop-n-Fresh, if Sandler wanted to win an Oscar, he'd play a gay guy or a mentally retarded guy in one of those cheese ball movies those old farts at the Academy love. Adam Sandler is out to be an idiot and be funny in the process, and this is another movie where he succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, all I can really say about the film is that if you like Adam Sandler and you've liked his other films, then you'll probably like this one as well. I wouldn't dare say it was anywhere near as good as "Happy Gilmore", but it was a lot better than "Little Nicky".The comedy is good for the most part, there were a few times where I was really laughing hard, but there were also times were I was thinking "What on earth was that?" Like I said though, the comedy is really good for the most part.The story is pretty good, but obviously nothing terribly complex or earth-shattering, it's a comedy after all, it got the job done. I'm very interested to see the original "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" (1936) now.Adam Sandler does a fine job in the film, nothing you wouldn't expect. The highlight of the film for me was Winona Ryder. She looked absolutely FANTASTIC throughout the film! She needs to keep her hair like it is in this film! Just fabulous! Another great addition to the film was John Turturro. This guy is a great actor, and he does a great job in this film as well. Some other great surprises include Steve Buscemi and Rob Schneider. There are also a few other interesting cameos in the film.All in all, I thought it was a good movie. It isn't the best movie Adam's ever made, but it is a nice addition. I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did. Thanks for reading.-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is your deed to watch this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprise was the first reaction I had following one of the funniest films of the year. Surprise was followed by joy as I learned that the 2002 version of "Mr. Deeds" contained an outstanding performance from an actor known only for his comedy, a story that has as much heart as jokes and a cast that works so well together it was difficult to tell where real life ended and the acting began. Comedy is the main course and romance was dessert featured on a menu that allows the audience to take two hours enjoy the feast provided by Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder, Peter Gallagher, Allen Covert, Steve Buscemi and John Turturro as they deliver non-stop comedy.With every great comedy there is a comedian who reigns victorious as he leads the charge to entertain audiences with comedic wit and charm; "Mr. Deeds" is no exception since Sandler accomplishes this task within the first 10 minutes. With the box-office success Sandler brought to films such as "Big Daddy," "The Waterboy" and "The Wedding Singer," I knew that "Mr. Deeds" would bring greater success. The most impressive aspect of the film was the presence of Sandler as he gave the BEST performance of his career. Along with his jokes, Sandler brought a surprise; versatility. Known exclusively for his comedic talents, Sandler brought much more including the ability to become a romantic lead and perform the role with conviction. Furthermore, Sandler was able to portray a character that everyone can sit back in awe.Behind every great romantic lead there is an outstanding actress, which makes the romantic aspect of the film, so much better. It was a brilliant move for the casting directors to get Ryder to play opposite Sandler because she is one of the main reasons "Mr. Deeds" works. She has always amazed audiences with her beauty, charm and immense talent, so when I found out she was attached to this film my face lit up because she gives 110 percent effort in each role.Gallagher, Turturro, Buscemi and Covert increased the comedic support to a film already high on laughter with their respective roles. Watching these actors brought a smile to my face because they were well-cast and each brought their brand of humor to the film and played very well off Sandler. With the addition of Buscemi and Covert, "Mr. Deeds" came alive as they come together to create the magic they brought to prior works with Sandler such as "Big Daddy" and "The Wedding Singer. Their familiarity with each other shows as they feed off each other very well.I will admit that "Mr. Deeds" contains a plot that has become cliche and makes me yearn for better creativity and originality. However, it was put together well and got me interested from the start.Overall, the script contains a sweet story that will leave everyone smiling and applauding because it does not attempt to do more than make you laugh. It would be a mistake for anyone to watch "Mr. Deeds" and walk away in disgust or feel let down because it is not a film that is meant to win an academy award, but to bring smiles and laughter to those who went. "Mr. Deeds" did accomplish this goal and added much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler really annoyed me when I first saw 'Billy Madison' in 1995. Since then, I've stuck with him and as annoying as his films can be, the guy grows on you. He really does. He's like a guy at a party you don't know but then party after party you keep meeting him and he becomes more familiar in a positive sort of way. 'Mr. Deeds' is really a sweet, old fashioned love story with hilarious prat falls, low rent humour and is the perfect movie for viewing if you've had a bad day. This capsule review is pretty much standard for all of his films but there is a market for his films and Sandler might get better and better and at least he has style all his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Deeds (2002) - **1/2 (out of ****)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLOT: Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) is an average guy who owns a pizza parlor in Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire (a town nobody has ever heard of). Deeds is then surprised to learn that a uncle he never knew he had froze to death on a mountain, and he is the heir to his $40 billion dollar fortune. So he goes to New York City, and starts to live the good life. Meanwhile, Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder) is trying to get the scoop on Deeds, so she pretends to be his girlfriend (they meet when she pretends to be a victim of a mugging, and Deeds comes to her rescue). She ends up falling for him, but the truth about her eventually leaks out.MY TAKE: Mr. Deeds is your typical Sandler vehicle. It has its funny moments (the lightning-fast servant played by John Turturro gets most of the laughs), and it's sweet-natured, just like Sandler's other films. The relationship between Sandler and Ryder is sweet, and I couldn't help but like that aspect of it. The movie is not without its flaws though. There's just not quite enough laughs to get a full-hearted recommendation from me - "Crazy Eyes" (played by the usually-great Steve Buscemi) was irritating because he didn't play any integral part in the movie. He was just there, hoping to get a few extra laughs from the audience. The film is also predictable, but I'm sure nobody expected a comedy that'd have a lot of unpredictable twists. I do have a heart for Sandler's films (I'm one of the only people that found Little Nicky bearable), because he always plays such a likable character. If you're a fan, then Mr. Deeds will fulfill your needs. Otherwise, rent The Wedding Singer or Happy Gilmore (Sandler's best films to date).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bring back the humor Sandler...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think every one of Sandler's movies have been hit-or-miss since Billy Madision and Happy Gilmore. I think the latest outing is the least funniest of all. Sandler plays Mr. Deeds, a man who inherits 40 billion dollars from a distant relative. Mr. Deeds seems very underwhelmed about the nice present, which I found odd. The jokes mainly come from the characters who surround Deeds. Unlike all the past Sandler movies, this one is horribly sappy for almost the entire length of the movie, with some jokes throw in between. Some are funny, but most are dull. Gosh, how I wish for the return to the humor that made Happy Madison Productions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike many films in this genre, the main character is not embarrasing but is an almost believable, normal guy. There are many funny moments and the film has a nice message but is rather spoilt buy the soppy ending which isn't surprising as this seems to be the standard format for ending 95% of films these days. Well worth watching, however, and should cheer up the foulest of moods on the wettest of days.</fullReview>

Each actor was perfect for the part they played.I think John Tuturro's performance(sorry to sound all "smart", but what else should i say?) was hysterical and was very good! I also really liked Peter Gallagher's performance(there it is again). I hafta say Peter is quite handsome(hehe). He is definetly a very good "villan" I guess you'd call his character??And as always, Adam Sandler was hysterical and the movie couldn't have been better without him!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was better then I expected. Sandlers last movie, Little Nicky, left me with doubts about this one. But this was in my opinion Sandlers best movie yet. Not only was the humor in the movie good, The plot was good as well. In this movie Deeds inheirts $40,000,000,000 (I think I have the right number of zeros). Even in hit movie he plays a small-town man that becomes a big-town hero. If your a fan of Big Daddy and The Wedding Singer this one has a plot for you. But if your a fan of Waterboy, Little Nicky, Happy Gilmore, and Billy Madison there is humor in this movie for you. I strongly recommened to see this movie and parents go ahead bring your kids its not that bad of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandler's back with a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Little Nicky", I wasn't looking forward to "Mr. Deeds" the same way I looked forward to Sandler's other movies. But I'm glad I went to see this movie, because it is funny and entertaining. Like "Big Daddy", Sandler is just playing a normal guy. I think these are the best types of roles for him. Something fun with every Sandler flick is finding those 3 or 4 friends of his that are in ALL of his movies. If anything, these guys are versatile. The real show-stopper of "Mr. Deeds" is John Turturro ("O Brother, Where Art Thou") as Emilio, the butler to Mr. Deeds. Turturro and Sandler work well together and their scenes always produce lots of laughter. I really enjoyed this movie a lot. The story was simple and it was funny.</fullReview>

John Turturro steals the film hands down with his hilarious Spanish butler characterization, and the good thing about Sandler is that he KNOWS Turturro is stealing it and he doesn't care, in fact you can tell he's enjoying the opportunity to let a brilliant actor shine. (He and Turturro have much better chemistry than he and Winona Ryder, who does the best she can with basically a thankless role.)

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler's Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best film I have ever seen Adam Sandler star in. Adam Sandler plays a naive but well-meaning country boy named Longfellow Deeds. Going only by Deeds, this man shakes up the business world which yields positive outcomes. Adam Sandler tackles the character of Deeds with ease. In my humble opinion, this will probably be the roll that Adam Sandler will be remembered for the most. The characters in most of his movies are usually jerks but this one is different. He is a jerk only to those who are jerks to others. Therefore, he is very likeable. As for the others, John Tuturro had the best supporting performance as Emilio and Winona Ryder did well as the seductive reporter who has the change of heart. Peter Galegher did well in the comedic villain roll (he is usually better as a villain in a dramatic roll). Steven Brill hits another home run with his perfect comedic direction of the film. This is also Steven Brill's best work (IMHO). Overall, this is a comedy that I will remember for a long time and ranks up with the greats of all time.Finally, the five best Adam Sandler films in my mind are 5) Big Daddy 4) Billy Madison 3) The Wedding Singer 2) Happy Gilmore 1) Mr. Deeds</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not even sure that it's fair to call this an Adam Sandler movie, since there's nothing Adam Sandler about his performance. He's so bland in this film with his "nice guy from a small town" act, oh but he also punches a few people. Terrific. We've already seen Sandler punching out people he doesn't like in "Happy Gilmore". Show us something new, Adam.I enjoyed "Happy Gilmore" and "Billy Madison" because they featured an over-the-top Sandler, he was funny on his own. In "Mr. Deeds", however, he's too often playing the straight man to wacky minor characters. That's another huge problem with this film, the minor characters are not as funny as characters from past Sandler movies. Steve Buscemi was much funnier in "The Wedding Singer", "Big Daddy", and "Billy Madison" than he is here. Perhaps the biggest problem with "Mr. Deeds" is the lack of a memorable scene. There is no fight with Bob Barker here, there's not even anything close. We do, however, get to here about 15 unfunny little Sandler rhymes (Deeds hopes to write greeting cards). Are we supposed to find these funny? There's no edge to them like in Sandler's songs. As a friend of mine pointed out, this seems like a movie Sandler made just to show his girlfriend that he's a nice guy. I certainly hope it wasn't made with the intention of being funny, because it fails miserably. 2 out of 10, with one point given for Winona Ryder actually looking decent (amazing what having long hair can do for a girl).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a somewhat unique perspective on this film, because two days after I saw it, I also saw Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson and Marisa Tomei filming "Anger Management" in Central Park. Sandler was very affable and a plain old regular guy. Had a kickin' trailer, too. Nice fellow, took time to come over and chat with the few fans out on that broiling day.I am not a particularly big fan of Mr. Sandler's movies, but can sit through them. I made it through this one without too much difficulty, which is a compliment to its relative quality. Every joke was dumbed down, every one done to death, the more obvious the better. That some people love that brand of comedy is undeniable, the six-year-old with us thought it was just the greatest. I laughed a few times, it went down painlessly.Sandler was Sandler, either you like his brand of obvious comedy and over-the-top sentimentality or you don't. Winona Ryder was mis-cast, didn't really fit the part that well, but any actress could have said her lines and done about the same. Dont' expect Caddyshack, but then, it is leaps and bounds above Pauly Shore. Nice views of New York City, nice supporting cast, a very likeable film. Recommended for those looking for very light entertainment.</fullReview>

The sweet/serious comedy was better than "Big Daddy" in its goofy own way, but not quite different from the 'Saturday night live' crazy pickle face man. What brought the movie together in the end was that once again, its bringing back all the old Adam Sandler gang that made all the followers of Happy Madison films giggle at the reappearance of the actors and jokes.

		<fullReview>At the beginning of the summer, I thought that Scooby Doo was going to be the worst attempt at comedy coming out this season. After seeing Mr. Deeds, however, I realize how wrong I was. No, I have not seen Scooby Doo, nor do I plan to, but at least I knew that beforehand. Adam Sandler's previous work was just enough for me to defy the critics and take a chance at his new movie. I can describe this only as a moment of temporary mental incapacitation.Not only is Sandler's whimpering voice enough to make you throw yourself in front of a speeding train, his jokes were simply not funny this time around. What's more, his costar, Winona Ryder, should be banned from acting...forever. The comedy was drab, the chemistry was non-existent, and the plot was capped off by a typically ridiculous "Adam Sandler movie ending."The only thing that keeps this movie somewhat afloat is John Turturro's performance as Emilio. His comedy was enjoyable, showing his far superiority to the supporting cast. I can honestly say that his lines were funny, yet everyone else's were not.In summary, I do not recommend Scooby Doo, but I dont recommend Mr. Deeds either. If you feel like laughing, go see the computer-generated dog; at least he might surprise you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently Adam Sandler dedicated this remake of the 1936 classic to his late grandmother. Now I can admire that, really I can, especially when the 1936 classic was her favourite film. But someone needs to tell Sandler that good intentions don't always make a good film. The ambition is there, but the film just isn't that great, not as pointless or as awful as the remakes to Psycho or the Wicker Man(which was unintentionally hilarious) I admit but sorry this wasn't good. There are one or two good things, such as the soundtrack, striking scenery and John Tuturro's turn as the Spanish butler. However, the script is cloying and lacking in wit, the direction is uninspired and the story is too saccharine and simplistic. Then in terms of acting, Adam Sandler gives one of his more unlikeable performances(I liked him in The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates and Spanglish though found him irritating here and in Click) and Winona Ryder while she looks lovely forgets her acting lessons. Overall, has its good points but it isn't great. 4/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Most romantic comedies are all the same, but this one's a bit different. There are a few hilarious scenes, then the rest is just mildly funny. I don't mind this, but that's one of the reasons why I'm starting to not like PG-13 comedies very much. In rated R comedies, it's usually either kind of boring or hilarious. Most PG 13 comedies are just mildly funny. This one is a bit more than mildly funny.Although I was a little bit disappointed with how far they took the romantic part.Overall, it was pretty good. 7/10.</fullReview>

"Billy Madison" is pretty lame, "Big Daddy" is amusing, "Little Nicky" is a terrible mess and "Mr. Deeds" (a remake of the Jimmy Stewart film) is proof that you should let a sleeping dog lie - this is like watching "Big Daddy" all over again! It's directed the same way, musically scored the same way, and even the general sense of humor is exactly the same! Take Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) and replace him with Sonny from "Big Daddy" and you wouldn't know the difference.The problem is it just isn't very funny or amusing. Winona Ryder falling in love with Sandler? Talk about no chemistry or believability. It's totally forced. The whole villainous scheme to rob Longfellow of his inheritance never really works and comes across as forced, also.If you're a huge Sandler fan, you may feel you "need" to see or own this to complete the collection - but most die-hard Sandlerites I've talked to think this is one of his worst films and it's easy to see why. It's just lame, not very funny and rather dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Longfellow Deeds, a small-town pizzeria owner and poet, inherits $40 billion from his deceased uncle, he quickly begins rolling in a different kind of dough.Moving to the big city, Deeds finds himself besieged by opportunists all gunning for their pie.Babe, a television tabloid reporter, poses as an innocent small-town girl to do an expos on Deeds. Of course, Deeds' sincere naivet has Babe falling in love with him instead.Ultimately, Deeds comes to find that money truly has the power to change things, but it doesn't necessarily need to change him....So the thing is about this film, is that it's been done time and time again by Sandler. He plays the nice guy against the odds, who meets a nice girl, but has a lot of obstacles to overcome, usually in the shape of very rich people.But these films work on so many levels. Not because of the story or the flow of the narrative, it's the random characters and their traits, that distract the viewer from the story, and just deliver the big laughs.There is nothing original in the story, but the fact that a tennis player can jump 15 or so feet in the air, an opera singer sings as he is being beaten up, John Tuturro being sneaky, just makes for the film to so silly, you cannot help but laugh.And laugh I did. It's one of Sandlers best films, and despite the fact his movies are gradually diminishing in quality, you cannot help but smile.It's a big fat sunshine movie, full of joy, and guaranteed to make you laugh.Don't be a snob, let yourself go....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MR. DEEDS is Adam Sandler's breezy re-thinking of the Gary Cooper classic MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN. In this version, Sandler plays Longfellow Deeds, a small town schnook who works in a pizza parlor and writes greeting cards, who learns that he is the only living relative of an eccentric millionaire named Preston Blake, who dies and leaves Deeds 40 million dollars. Deeds must then travel to New York to sign papers regarding the estate and gets involved with a TV tabloid reporter (Winona Ryder), who is pretending to be a nurse in order to get a story on him but falls for him in the process. Sandler has rarely been more likable on screen, making Deeds warm and extremely likable and though she's no Jean Arthur, Ryder proves to be an intelligent screen presence and one of Sandler's best leading ladies. Peter Gallagher is appropriately slimy as Chuck Cedar, Blake's CEO who wants to steal the company from deeds and there's also great bits offered by John Tuturro as Deeds' butler and Conchata Farrell as his best friend back home. Exuberant direction and a deft screenplay are the final touches to one of Sandler's best efforts and a respectful valentine to the film it salutes.</fullReview>

Since he didn't have any family his heir (the only living relative) was traced down to a small town no one had heard of ..... Mandrake falls .... the lucky guy being Longfellow Deeds.Longfellow played brilliantly by Adam Sandler was a small town simpleton .. good at heart ... helping ...caring ... and owned a pizza place .. ''Deed's Pizza'' . Due to his nature the whole town loved him. He used to write cards but hallmark always eluded him.He is brought to the new york city and the whole town is after him... trying to get a scoop by somehow duping the simpleton. The rival media to Blake media had a reporter Babe Benett (Winona Ryder) who tries to get close to him for a media scoop and gradually ends up falling in love with the simple good hearted guy with a right foot so badly subjected to frost bite in his childhood that he had no feeling left in it.But later he gets to know of all the treachery and donates his share to the 'Negro College Fund' and leaves for his hometown only to find out that his uncle's company would be broken and all 50,000 employees would be thrown out.This also features some really funny performances by tennis' very own bad boy John Mackenroe... like the instance when Deeds and Johnnie boy throw eggs at moving cars .. and a lot more.Another hilarious character was 'Crazy eyes' played by Steve Buscemi ... he had his eyeballs facing different directions ..who was first shown in jail for biting the mailman.. because he thought he was casting a spell on him .. he however figured out that the postman could be waving at him as well.Who can forget the sneaky butler played by John Turturro .. he could appear out of anywhere and disappear from anywhere ... kind of reminding me of Batman. When he saw Deeds' right foot he said that the hediousness of that foot would haunt him forever.To find out how he manages to save his uncle's company and how his love wins him back.... check out this hilarious new and improved Mr. Deeds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard the original "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" was one of the great classic movies, and while I would like to see that one, I have a feeling this one doesn't compare.But it doesn't have to. I like Adam Sandler's loser characters, and in this movie, Longfellow Deeds isn't even a loser except in New York City. In Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire, he is one of the leading citizens and everyone likes him. He tries to keep his small-town values in New York City, but of course he is seen as a hick and not respected there. I thought his violent reaction to such treatment was uncalled for, but it seems to be a trademark of Adam Sandler films. Still, he only uses violence here when he or someone else is being mistreated. Walking away might have been a better choice when it was just him, but it's fun to watch Sandler beat people up.Even though this film is little more than a live-action cartoon and not meant to be taken seriously, it does have some redeeming values. First of all, Deeds cares about people, not money, and in many ways he tries to be a good person while all around him let greed rule their lives.And there are several good acting performances. I thought Winona Ryder was absolutely adorable as the news producer who poses as a small-town nurse with values similar to Deeds'. Conchata Ferrell delivered consistently as a tough, no-nonsense co-worker of Deeds' back in New Hampshire, and Steve Buscemi was funny as one of the nutty townspeople. Also Harve Presnell in the few scenes he had as the billionaire.John Turturro, though, gave the standout performance as the butler who came with Deeds' inheritance.The stunt work was pretty impressive for this type of film. There wasn't a lot of slapstick, but there was just enough. The rescue of seven cats by a firefighter was one of the highlights--but don't try this at home!Another great comic moment happened in a second small town similar to Deeds' New Hampshire community. I can't provide any more details!This film could have done without the cursing. Fortunately, Fox cleaned up most of it.It's a feel-good movie with a likable lead, but certainly not one that would have won Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>as it turns out, some millionaires have made the mistake that Preston Blake makes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since this remake of a classic movie is an Adam Sandler flick, you can pretty much predict most of it, namely the fact that he can get aggressive and that one character eventually reveals something embarrassing about himself. But otherwise, you're sure to have a good time. As an earthy goof-ball inheriting a massive fortune and turning the business world upside down, Sandler makes the most of his role. In supporting roles, Winona Ryder, John Turturro and Steve Buscemi have some great moments. Obviously, "Mr. Deeds" isn't any kind of "Citizen Kane"-style masterpiece, but it doesn't pretend to be; and let's face it, this movie easily beats any Jean-Claude Van Damme movie for smarts. Nice, goofy fun. Also starring Allen Covert, Peter Gallagher and Jared Harris.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler's funniest movie up to date debatable against Happy Gilmore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler stars as the lovable Longfellow Deeds in Mr. Deeds. Directed by Steve Brill, it also stars the likes of Winona Ryder, John Turturro, and Peter Gallagher. Mr. Deeds in my opinion is probably Sandler's funniest movie along with Happy Gilmore. I wouldn't say much for movies like Eight Crazy Nights, as that's his voice. Anger Management was all right while 50 First Dates wasn't all that great. And his latest that just came out this weekend, Spanglish, although is directed by the brilliant James L. Brooks, doesn't seem all that funny.Longfellow Deeds (Sandler) is a man with his own Pizzeria in a small town in New Hampshire called Mandrake Falls. It's a town in which everyone knows each other and everyone gathers at his pizza place. He writes greeting cards and has a nice life. One thing he didn't know was that he had a billionaire great-uncle who died on his way up Mont Everest. Now, his workers including Chuck Cedar (Gallagher) go get him from this small town and bring him to New York and give him his uncle's life. Now Deeds lives large and does business his way with hilarious antics. A news channel anchor than sends one of his best reporters to learn more about him. Her name is Babe Bennett (Ryder) and she meets Deeds. The fun begins as Sandler gives a major laugh-out-loud performance.There are some little things you might notice when you watch Mr. Deeds again and again. If you're a fan of The O.C and watch it every week, you'll start to get pretty annoyed by Peter Gallagher's mustache in this movie, as he looks much different in the show. As well, John Turturro does a great job as Emilio Lopez, a butler for Deeds. He plays a Spanish guy here and his accent and behavior is perfectly played.Overall, Mr. Deeds is a great film. It's probably Sandler's best comedy. Great performances and great laughs! You'll be laughing very hard. We'll just have to see what Sandler will be making in the future. Long live the rich! My Rating: 8.5/10 (A Low 8.5)Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprise was the first reaction I had following one of the funniest films of 2002. Surprise was followed by joy as I learned that the 2002 version of "Mr. Deeds" contained an outstanding performance from an actor known only for his comedy, a story that has as much heart as jokes and a cast that works so well together it was difficult to tell where real life ended and the acting began. Comedy is the main course and romance was served as dessert on a menu that allowed the audience to take two hours and enjoy the feast provided by Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder, Peter Gallagher, Allen Covert, Steve Buscemi and John Turturro as they delivered non-stop comedy.With every great comedy there is a comedian who reigns victorious as he leads the charge to entertain audiences with comedic wit and charm; "Mr. Deeds" is no exception since Sandler accomplishes this task within the first 10 minutes. With the box-office success Sandler brought to films such as "Big Daddy," "The Waterboy" and "The Wedding Singer," I knew that "Mr. Deeds" would bring greater success. The most impressive aspect of the film was the presence of Sandler as he gave the BEST performance of his career.Along with his jokes, Sandler brought a surprise; versatility. Known exclusively for his comedic talents, Sandler brought much more including the ability to become a romantic lead and perform the role with conviction. Furthermore, Sandler was able to portray a character that everyone can sit back in awe.Behind every great romantic lead there is an outstanding actress, which makes the romantic aspect of the film, so much better. It was a brilliant move for the casting directors to get Ryder to play opposite Sandler because she is one of the main reasons "Mr. Deeds" works. She has always amazed audiences with her beauty, charm and immense talent, so when I found out she was attached to this film my face lit up because she gives 110 percent effort in each role.Gallagher, Turturro, Buscemi and Covert increased the comedic support to a film already high on laughter with their respective roles.Watching these actors brought a smile to my face because they were well-cast and each brought their brand of humor to the film and played very well off Sandler. With the addition of Buscemi and Covert, "Mr. Deeds" came alive as they come together to create the magic they brought to prior works with Sandler such as "Big Daddy" and "The Wedding Singer. Their familiarity with each other shows as they feed off each other very well.I will admit that "Mr. Deeds" contains a plot that has become cliche and makes me yearn for better creativity and originality. However, it was put together well and got me interested from the start.Overall, the script contains a sweet story that will leave everyone smiling and applauding because it does not attempt to do more than make you laugh. It would be a mistake for anyone to watch "Mr. Deeds" and walk away in disgust or feel let down. However, it should bring smiles and laughter to those who saw it. "Mr. Deeds" did accomplish this goal and added much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely Updated Remake of a Capra Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I was not aware that it was the same story of one of my favorite films, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town. I just picked it up from the library because I was on a Adam Sandler kick. But truely it was sone very nicely. They did update the humor a little but the story was just the same. I think it teaches a lot about character and greed, also about our society. I think it does show that with all of our interfering with the way children are raised to look at money, and wealth that it will never change, and we will always have those greedy people in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all due respect to the original 1936 feature, and to those who hold dear the "sanctity of all things old," this is a funny movie. The original was charming, Gary Cooper was, well he was Gary Cooper (enough said). I doubt that Adam Sandler set out to compete with Gary Cooper in his interpretation of the Longfellow Deeds character.The fact remains that Mr. Deeds (2002) is a funny film. Laughter and an appreciation of comedy, even silliness, has been one of the things that binds my family together. There are a few comedies over the years that have contained quotable lines that became a part of the family repertoire. (I'll refrain from listing them here but for context Caddyshack, and many Mel Brooks features made the roster). Mr. Deeds joined the ranks after the first viewing. "Handshakes are for strangers, we hug around here, pal." "Sneaky, sneaky, sir." "Who are your friends? [introduction] Oh... I don't like 'em (smiling)."Okay, the movie lacks any serious contribution to culture. Yeah, well that's what they said about the Three Stooges. Try Mr. Deeds; if you'll let yourself, you'll like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest film in the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Possible Spoilers Mr Deeds inherits 40 billion dollars from his great uncle and sets off to New York to collect it. A good thing about his fortunes is that he gets to live in a wonderfully large apartment, with a sneaky but sweet butler for company. Things get even better when he meets Pam Dawson, a sweet school nurse who he falls in love with.But Pam is in fact Bebe, a newspaper reporter who is trying to find out all his hidden secrets. Soon Bebe discovers her feelings for him, and that she loves his loveable charms too, but Mr Deeds has already discovered that he has been lied to.A wonderfully funny romantic comedy that made me laugh a lot, I would recommend this to anyone. Adam Sandler is hilariously funny, and Winona Ryder gives a flawless performance as the sneaky reporter. There are some excellently hilarious moments in this movie such as when Mr Deeds slides down the stair banisters and breaks his fall on the coffee table, and when Mr Deeds throws a bin on a mans body to stop him from running away. A+++++++ entertainment. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Mr. Deeds. Adam Sandler is always great and hilarious in his movies, and it was just the same here, maybe even better. I'm not sure if this was true, but I heard that Adam Sandler did this movie because the original Mr. Deeds Goes To Town was her favorite movie. Winona Ryder was also great, and Steve Buscemi (who seems to be in a lot of Sandlers' movies was great as Crazy Eyes, the guy who ordered pizza w/gum balls and peanut butter on it. This is a great and HILARIOUS movie. Especially the part with the 7 cats!!! That is the best part. You have to see this movie! I give Mr. Deeds a 10 out of 10!:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler is a real comedic genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler has always been one of my favorite comedy actors and Mr. Deeds is one of my favorite of his movies. In Mr. Deeds, he plays Longfellow Deeds, a small town citizen who owns a pizzeria.The movie starts out with Preston Blake, an 82-year-old who has accomplished so much and still wants to achieve a lot. He ends up dying after making it to the top of Mt. Everest. It is found out that Deeds is the closing living relative that can be found. Deeds inherits $40 billion. So, Deeds has to go to New York to sign the papers and get his money.Deeds later meets Babe Bennett, a newspaper reporter played by Winona Ryder. Bennett is purposely disguising herself as Pam Dawson, a school nurse from Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa. Deeds falls in love with her and finds out that she is a liar.Sandler and Ryder have great chemistry together as the protagonist and the love interest. Along with Sandler and Ryder are performances and cameos by Sandler's buddies. John Turturro plays Emilio, Preston Blake's butler, who turns out to be Blake's son. Steve Buscemi plays Crazy Eyes, a citizen who has a self explanatory name. Peter Dante plays an employee at Deeds's pizzeria. Allen Covert plays a co-worker of Bennett's. Blake Clark makes a cameo as the father of a quarterback that Deeds punched out. Rob Schneider even makes a cameo reprising his role as the delivery man from Big Daddy.Peter Gallagher is good in his role as Chuck Cedar, who was Preston Blake's right hand man. Gallagher shows how much of a jerk Cedar is as he tries to take advantage of Deeds and walk all over him. Jared Harris is also good at playing a jerk in Mac McGrath, Bennett's boss. McGrath is out to make Deeds look bad.While I haven't seen Frank Capra's original version starring Gary Cooper, this version directed by Steven Brill is very funny and the laughs keep coming. Adam Sandler is very funny in this role. This movie is as funny as Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and Anger Management.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Deeds, in my opinion, marks a point in Adam Sandler's career where it seems that the majority of the thinking audience will, if they haven't already, begin to wonder whether Sandler will ever do anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The new name for the character that Sandler plays in every movie is, in this case, Mr. Deeds, a small town man who learns that he is the inheritor of a massive fortune from a distant relative who is a media mogul. Deeds lives in the tiny town of Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire, where he is constantly the talk of the entire town, the borders of which do not seem to extend very far past the doors of the pizzeria that he owns. He comes to New York to see what all the financial fuss is about, and as all his friends at home watch him on TV, he proceeds to try to take part in the company rather than taking his inheritance and going back into obscurity where he clearly belongs.(spoilers) The fortune is, first of all, ridiculously exaggerated. There is no one in the target audience of this film (nor, really, many people at all in the world) who can really visualize how much money $40 billion exactly is. That's not even money, as James Caan said in The Way of the Gun (where he speaks about $50 million, I believe), it's a new life. Money is what you get out of the ATM, it's what you take to the grocery store. $40 billion is so astronomical that they may as well have just said that Deeds has inherited all the money in the world.On the other hand, while I thought that the film had a positive message against greed and corruption, the fact that Deeds turned down the inheritance (simply saying that he doesn't want that money) could not have been more poorly executed. First of all, when he decides that he just doesn't want it, if you listen you can hear everyone in the audience slapping their foreheads almost as hard as when Mox pulled that `oh-I-just-can't' crap during the whipped cream bikini scene in Varsity Blues. Second, while it was nice to see that Deeds decides to donate the money to charity instead of accepting more money than any single human being could spend in 20 lifetimes with wide-eyed glee, this part of the film was probably the least creative thing in the entire movie, which wasn't very creative to begin with.I can imagine the writers of the movie writing this scene at the end of the day or right before their lunch hour, just because it's so obvious that it was slapped together. When Deeds asked the name of that one charity, you know, that one..Yeah, give it to those guys. You can just picture the writers already half out of their chairs and on their way out of the room when someone says wait, what does he do with the money, and they say much the same thing that he says in the movie. You can almost see the indifferent wave of the hand and maybe something like, `Oh, just have him give it to some charity.' This reminds me of Hollow Man, which is a film that had nearly endless possibilities, which were all completely ignored in favor of a simplistic and clichd plot.I know it may seem like I'm making a big deal about something that's kind of trivial, but it's really not. There could be a lot of meaning delivered in who he gives the money to, and it could have been a lot of fun, too. Even something as simple as what Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) did with all the money at the end of Reindeer Games (2000) was more creative and more fun than this.The whole plot involving Winona Ryder's character (charmingly named `Babe') was crude and tacked on. While it was interesting that she played a character who tried to skewer Deeds to get a good news story (albeit a heavily dramatized and altered one), the fact that she ultimately falls in love with him and has to convince him that she really loves him after he's already found out that she's been lying to him is one of the oldest plot ploys in the book of writing cheesy comedies (and cheesy action movies, and cheesy dramas, etc.).Mr. Deeds is a film made for Adam Sandler films. I will readily admit that I enjoy many of Sandler's films (such as Billy Madison, to some extent, The Waterboy, Happy Gilmore, which I LOVED, etc.), but for the same reason that I like to watch Van Damme and Steven Seagal movies. They are totally goofy B-movies, but there is some sort of backwards, amusing charm to them that makes them attractive. Critics are sure to hate those movies, as well as a movie like Mr. Deeds, and they have plenty of reason to, obviously, but Sandler fans are not likely to be entirely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoever thinks this movie is rubbish is dead wrong. I laughed throughout the whole of this movie. I watched it on Cable and didn't really know much about it except that it had been in the cinemas recently. I had seen some other Sandler/Herlihy movies ages ago and thought they were hilarious, but I did not know this was one of their movies so I didn't know it what it was going to be like. Like their other movies this one delivers brilliantly with some particularly very, very funny scenes. I won't give any away but I can name plenty of them. I have not seen all of Tim and Adam's movies, but I definitely will soon. So far I have seen Happy Gilmore, Mr. Deeds, The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy and Big Daddy and found them all funny but my favourites are ranked:1. Happy Gilmore 2. Mr. Deeds 3. The Waterboy 4. The Wedding Singer 5. Big DaddyAnyway watch Mr, Deeds whenever you get the chance. I can assure you, you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Deeds is a great movie. To me it is one of Adam Sandler's best movies yet. I enjoyed it very much.Steve Buscemi who played Crazy Eyes was my absolute favorite character from this movie. He was the "comic relief" of the movie. He was brilliant as Crazy Eyes.Mr. Deeds is actually a better movie than what IMDb says it is. As you can see, the film got a 5.5/10. I believe this movie should have got at least a 7.0/10 or more.The director, Steven Brill did an excellent job of directing this film and he should stick with making comedies like Mr. Deeds.John Turturro, who played Emilio Lopez, was absolutely brilliant in this film. I believe this is his best work so far. He was priceless as Mr. Lopez.Overall this film is great. I don't know why IMDb users have only given it a 5.5/10. I think it should be much higher than that. In my opinion, you should see this film. It's funny, action packed, and even heartbreaking in some places. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

DEEDS would put Sandler back in the saddle with some more dramatized ideas with a lot of crude humor thrown in the middle. So, basically, I was hoping for a second BIG DADDY. And after about the first fifteen minutes, me and my friends actually considered walking out. The film is just not funny. I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. The only funny line in the entire film comes from Peter Dante. Sandler has hit rock bottom. If you thought LITTLE NICKY was a disappointment, then keep away! Two burn-outs in a row. What happened to him? The best thing to happen to this film would be Winona Ryder who looks pretty hott as a blonde. So, my bottom-line rating: THIS MOVIE SUCKS!MR. DEEDS gets 2/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a bad romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's interesting this time around about Adam Sandler's new comedy reach out, Mr. Deeds, Sandler-esque remake of the Capra film from 1936, is that it works on two different levels, one as a romantic comedy set in New York, and the other as Sandler's usual comic stylings put into a plot with some predictability but always fun. It works well on both those levels, making it also one of the funniest films of the summer of 2012.Deeds is played by Sandler, a poet in a small town who is in line to inherit 40 billion dollars from a dead billionaire Uncle, with Ryder as reporter trying to get an undercover scoop.Sort of in the vein of Wedding Singer, with references to Big Daddy and including cast members from past Happy Madison productions, it might not be for everyone, but for fans, or those in look for solid laughs, taking a viewing is a good be; alumni this time include Steve Buscemi Allen Covert, and Rob Schneider.</fullReview>
