		<shortDescription>"If this movie doesn't make your skin crawl... then it's on too tight!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released and ignored in 1973, "Black Christmas" became a forgotten classic. The Canadian shocker was eventually re-released as "Silent Night, Evil Sight" in order to avoid confusion with the blaxploitation films of the time, but it bombed once again. In the early 80s, it was broadcast on cable as "Stranger in the House" in order to snatch up some rantings. Right when the movie seemed dead, NBC decided to cancel a prime-time airing of it because it was deemed "too scary" for network television. This was all film-buffs needed to go back and discover the wonderful "cool movie that you never heard of" that is "Black Christmas".Before I go on, here it goes: "Black Christmas" is one of the scariest (and finest) horror films ever made. Major credit must go to director Bob Clark (who went on to direct the epic "Citizen Kane" remake and because of legal reasons had to change it's title to "Porky's") who like John Carpenter in "Halloween", is able to create a current and simplistic creepy atmosphere. "Black Christmas" is indeed very similar to "Halloween": Both movies are themed with a particular time of year, both movies feature a killer with breathing problems who loves POV shots, and both movies have a long and slow build-up that makes the audience care for the characters that are about to get slashed. The difference is that "Black Christmas" does it much better, in fact, I think it is a superior film.The movie begins with a shaky POV shot of a stranger who decides to sneak inside a sorority house in order to get some fresh meat. That's it! Plain and simple. There is no "your father killed my cousin's cat" motive, the killer wants to kill because he simply wants to. Isn't it much scarier like that? No motive at all?The cast is not your usual teen slasher stereotypes: There is the not-so-virginal sweet leading lady Jess (Olivia Hussey) who is having trouble because she wants to have an abortion. Her boyfriend Peter (Keir Duella) eventually disagrees. In the sorority house there are many other odd characters, including chain-smoking, foul-mouthed, heavy-drinking Barb (ironically played by Margot Kidder) who steals the show with the much-needed humor. Unlike the countless other slashers out there, "Black Christmas" takes time for the audience to get used to these characters and actually care for them. Unlike in "Halloween", the entire top-notch cast in "Black Christmas" give excellent performances. Olivia Hussey is perfect as not-so-innocent Jess, Keir Duella is scary and misleading as her deranged boyfriend. And of course, Margot Kidder steals the show with an excellent and amusing take playing herself. Also noticeable is cult star John Saxon as Lt. Fuller who many years later started showing his personal love for "Black Christmas" on interviews.The well-balanced doses of drama and comedy connects the audience to the characters on screen so strongly that they sometimes we forget it is a horror movie. And when something scary eventually happens, it comes as a total shock. Bob Clark eventually became famous for his comedies, and you can sense his upbeat sense of humor though the entire film. Recent movie audiences lost their patience, so movies like that can't be made anymore. And there is a good reason "Black Christmas" is currently labeled as a comedy at the IMDb, it is really funny. So many memorable quotes here: "These broads could hump the Leaning Tower of Pisa if they could get to top of it!" or "I'm a drunk? Here we have the queen of vodka herself!" and of course, the whole Fellatio address.But isn't this a horror film? It really lives up to it's tagline. To begin with, the killer is not a silent invincible maniac on a Santa Claus costume. Instead, he is never seen. Most of his moments come from POV shots and dark takes. He is confined to the sorority house's attic for most of the time. How is that scary? Sound comes to play. The killer calls the sorority girls though the phone many times (early shades of "Scream" and "When a Stranger Calls") and uses some of the most disturbing voices you will ever hear. He imitates pigs squeaking, perverted dirty talk, animal noises, screaming, heavy breathing, and many other weird sounds. Does it work? Of course. This guy makes Norman Bates look like Richard Simmons.These disturbing elements are all put together though the brilliant cinematography by Reg Morris, who is able to capture the silent Christmas atmosphere perfectly with the wonderful use of silent snow-covered streets and decoration. Let's face it, Christmas is a bit creepy, isn't it? It certainly will be after watching this flick. The piano score by Carl Zittrer is simplistic and effective as well. The repetitive use of Christmas carols also add up to the tension.Ignored over the years and unknown outside the cult horror fans, this is an underrated classic that deserves much more attention that it ever got. Everything is perfect in this Canadian chiller: The atmosphere, the music, the overall spooky look, and one of the scariest villains in history. No gore (although the killings are so disturbingly shot they don't really need any) no sex, no nudity, just plain old-fashioned horror. This is "Black Christmas": Snow-covered silent streets, creepy Christmas carols, spooky use of lightening and color, scary atmosphere and the overall look of the plastic bag suffocated victim in a rocking chair staring from the attic window. Trust me, you will never go to your attic the same way again."Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, a creature was staring..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original and perhaps the best slasher film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The girls of a sorority house are being tormented by a twisted prank caller who continually calls to convey increasingly vile and abusive sentiments. What at first appears to be a sick joke eventually turns violent for the girls during the season of supposed goodwill and merriment.The original and maybe even the best, ?Black Christmas' set the ball rolling for the slasher genre and was the biggest influence for the phenomenally successful John Carpenter classic, ?Halloween' (1978), which was, in fact, originally conceived as a sequel. Although Italian director, Mario Bava, had previously created what some see as the first slasher movie, ?Bay of Blood' (1971), it was ?Black Christmas' that was to become recognised as the catalyst for one of the most lucrative sub-genres of horror cinema. Bob Clark (who previously made the kooky, enjoyable, low-budget zombie film ?Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things' (1972)), still at this point something of an amateur director, took a simple yet naturally frightening concept and turned it into one of the most unsettling and nerve-wracking one hundred minutes in cinematic history. Only a select few films such as ?The Haunting' (1963) and ?Alien' (1979) are atmospheric enough to truly equate to the eeriness and feelings of apprehension that are to be induced by ?Black Christmas'.The simplicity of the production is what makes it so endearing. There are no overly bloody death sequences or unlikely, comic-book style events; the viewer is just presented with an unnerving tale which could easily have a strong basis in reality. Inventive camerawork and POV shots as well as a superlative use of lighting are the elements that combine to achieve the desired results. The often pseudo-claustrophobic environment of the sorority house, from where the vast majority of events occur, offers the perfect, vulnerable and unguarded location susceptible to intrusion and thus attributes to the continual foreboding atmosphere. Clark was not afraid to take time building both the story and characterisation as well as introduce the viewer to the aspects that he would use to build the suspense. This is prepared before plunging the viewer into a seemingly uncontrolled nightmare that one experiences along with the protagonists. Another aspect that firmly stands out is the mysterious way that everything is presented; even at the very end, very little has truly been explained yet everything seems like it should have an obvious explanation. Even in its undoubted simplicity, ?Black Christmas' has complicated facets that require thought from the viewer to entirely comprehend the film. In some ways, the concealing of several key points puts the viewer's knowledge of events on a par with the actual characters.?Black Christmas' is also complimented wonderfully by strong acting performances from Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, John Saxon and a highly pleasant and amusing turn from Marian Waldman. Despite the tiny budget, this is a highly polished horror film that genuinely belongs among the elite of the genre. This is where it all started and those familiar with later slasher films such as ?Halloween', ?Friday the 13th' (1980), Slumber Party Massacre (1982) and ?The House on Sorority Row' (1983) should be able to spot several of the now-clichés that first materialized in ?Black Christmas'. My rating for ?Black Christmas' - 8?/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often that you find a film in the thriller/horror genre that has something "new" to say, so it's even more exciting to find that one of the original films in the "slasher" genre is actually still one of the freshest, most unique and utterly entertaining of them all. This is the kind of movie you can't wait to tell your friends about, knowing full well they've probably never seen it, but they've heard of it.Everything about this film is stellar. The acting, to steal the words of a great reviewer who loves this movie, is flawless. The direction is confident and assured. What is Bob Clark's story? How did he go from making quirky, ground-breaking horror to...well..."Baby Geniuses 2?" His black-humored wit is on display in all his movies, and here too. Margot Kidder and Marian Waldman shine as foul-mouthed alcohol abusers. Particularly Kidder--it's hard to believe she did this at the BEGINNING of her career, she's that assured...and fun to watch. Olivia Hussey is alluring as the lead, Jessica, and her beauty, as well as her speaking voice are a welcome presence.The plot might seem clichéd now, until you understand that it was all the movies that came AFTER that were the clichés--even "He Knows Your Alone," which seemed so vital at the time, can't compare. "Black Christmas" is a FILM, and goes beyond the conventions of a cheap slasher. The key is the ending--only a director with an artistic sensibility would have fought for it (no spoilers here). Suffice to say, in all the slashers I've watched I've never seen the equal. It's a tricky business to sum up a mystery in a plot, and few can maintain the element of surprise, intelligence or creativity required. You will NOT see the ending coming here, and though the end is a surprise, it works well.If you're like I was and hesitating to watch this because you think it'll just be "another fear film," don't waste anymore time! You will NOT be sorry you spent your Christmas "black..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovers of John Carpenter's Halloween will love this film even more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I rented this film around the Christmas season of 1999, I did not know what to expect. The only reason why I rented it was that Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea were in the leading roles (I have a strange and sick obsession with Olivia Hussey and I liked Keir Dullea in 2001). But then when I first watched it that dark and cold Saturday night, I was amazed.The film's style was very dark and mysterious, as well as bizarre. While watching the film, I saw where John Carpenter might have gotten a lot of his filming technique from his 1978 classic, Halloween (one of my personal favorites). It, like Halloween, involves the murders of young women. And in the case of Black Christmas, it's sorority girls.What set this apart from Halloween is that the killer is less human than Michael Myers. You saw Michael Myers, but you do not see the killer in Black Christmas. Plus the killer is insane, especially when he rants. His rants make no sense, making his intentions unknown. He just kills, not for revenge like most horror films. But he just kills. I don't know about you, but that is what makes this film even scarier, aside from the spooky musical score.They say that Jamie Lee Curtis is the "scream queen." Well whoever thinks that obviously has not heard Olivia Hussey's lungs in action. That woman can SCREAM.It's best if you watch this film alone in a quiet house at night during the Christmas season. I did that the second time I watched it. I tell you the truth, I had a hard time walking downstairs to go to the bathroom I was so scared. And no horror film has ever done that to me since the first time I saw Scream about three years ago.Some may argue that the characters in the film are not very developed, but that does not matter because most of them die anyway. One of the few characters that stood out in this film was Barb (Margot Kidder). She is a drunk, trash-talking sorority girl who manages offend just about everybody. The woman who played the sorority house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marion Waldman), also stood out as a trash-talking, drunken woman. Olivia Hussey's character is a bit snobbish, like any sorority girl, but not to her other sisters. Keir Dullea's character is high-strung and unpredictable, which adds to the film mysterious style. But as for the rest, there really was no room for them to grow. Besides, like I just stated, most of them get killed off anyway.The end really surprised me. I mean, really. No questions asked. It even shocked me, but I'm going to spoil it for anyone. But if you loved John Carpenter's Halloween, you'll love this film even more. I guarantee it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuinely creepy horror classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Clark's "Black Christmas" is a horror classic.It's obvious that it was clearly an influence on the slasher films of the late seventies and early eighties."Black Christmas" takes place in a sorority house.Most of the sorority sisters go home for the holidays,while Barb(Margot Kidder),Jess(Oivia Hussey)and Phyl(Andrea Martin)stay behind.At the outset of the film,we see a mysterious killer enter the house and hide in the attic.He then begins to kill the sisters one by one,with each murder being followed by a disturbing phone call.Bob Clark managed to create a startling atmosphere of total dread and fear.The finale is extremely creepy and memorable.The soundtrack,particularly the killer's voice on the phone is frighteningly effective.So if you want to be scared give this gem a look.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavily Underrated and Overlooked Classic Slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To those of you Halloween fans, THIS is the film that came first, John Carpenter's Halloween is doused with aspects lifted directly from Bob Clark's Black Christmas. Alongside Psycho it remains one of my personal classics. Very unnearving and in parts horrific - the phone calls for instance. Basically its Christmas time, as the title suggests and an unknown killer has found his way into the attic of a sorority girls house and begins killing them one by one. Kidder's performance of the drunken, outspoken Barb is fantastic, followed closely by Olivia Hussey, who is truly beautiful in this movie. The camera work and direction is first rate, the first person perspective, heavy breathing - which most will know from Halloween, Mr Clark did it here first, and in my opinion, did it better than JC. It's not full of gore its full of suspense and wonderful creepy atmosphere, as I mentioned before, the phone calls really will put you on edge, as will the 'eye' scene. Get ready for a shocking ending and watch it again for all the bits that you didn't catch, believe me there will be some. Alongside Jacob's Ladder, Don't Look Now and The Fog this really is one of the most frightening films I have ever had the pleasure to acquire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps one of the most underrated films in Cinema history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before Jamie Blanks turned popular urban legends into a theme for his routine slasher franchise, director Bob Clark took one of the most vigorously touted of those fables and created a genre staple that would become the forerunner of the stalk and slash cycle. Comparisons can obviously be drawn between this and Halloween, including notorious but unconfirmed reports that Carpenter's film was in fact based upon an un-produced concept that Clark had earlier initiated as a sequel to this 1974 sleeper. Both efforts certainly have a lot in common with one another; including two excellent steady-cam openings - putting the viewer in the killer's shoes as he enters his 'soon to be' scene of a crime - that are almost interchangeable. On the 'making of' featurette for the 25th anniversary of Halloween, perhaps one commentator is fairly unjust when he states that it was that movie that started the excessive use of point of view shots that are so often imitated in horror cinema ever since. Black Christmas was equally as effective with its application of first person cinematography, a feat that John Carpenter clearly recognised before incorporating and perhaps improving upon it for his further acknowledged masterpiece.The story concerns a group of sorority sisters that are preparing for their Christmas celebrations in a remote house. They have been receiving bizarre and threatening calls from what sounds like a group of insane people, although no one takes them seriously at first, believing that they're just a typical prank from a few of the local town boys. However fears are ignited when one of the students, Claire (Lynne Griffin), doesn't arrive to meet her father on time and is reported missing. Later a child is found butchered in the park, whilst all the while the Looney continues his demented ringing and terrorising the young women. Before long Lieutenant Fuller (John Saxon) realises that there may be a link in the occurrences and asks Jess (Olivia Hussey) to remain close to her phone so that he can trace the line when the lunatic next rings. But will there be anyone left alive when that happens?Although this movie is neither graphic, gratuitous nor particularly unpleasant by today's standards, it remains one of the most disturbing and chilling 'slasher' movies ever made. Perhaps as mysteriously alluring as the exploits of Michael Myers and certainly far more alarming than any of the endless Friday the 13ths could ever hope to be. The killer creates the fear himself, but not in the typical methods that have become somewhat old-hat in more recent efforts. This assassin doesn't wear a mask, probably doesn't possess any super-human attributes and may only be threatening towards the female of our species. But his enigmatic ranting and crazy excessive skips between multiple personalities that are portrayed superbly over phone calls, which are all but too short; effortlessly allow him to become one of the creepiest wackos ever set to celluloid. Never has a telephone been implemented as a tool for creating fear so efficiently, there's something really unsettling as this Jekyl and Perhaps ten Mr. Hydes argues potently with himself. He changes his pitch from that of a high female to a deep and aggressive male and then back again, in a manner of pure and unadulterated insanity that really sticks in your throat. He perhaps reaches his most bloodcurdling moment when he drops all the wacky personas to adopt a civil yet curt voice and mutter once; `I'm going to kill you'. Proving to be the one and only direct threat that he makes in the whole movie.Where as Michael Myers' success was brought about by the mystery that surrounded the little that we knew of the true motivations of his character, a similar method has been used here. We never actually see who's terrorising these girls and we are never given a reason for his dementia. He often refers to himself as 'Billy' or 'Agatha' in his one sided conversations, but we never learn of the events that made him spiral into such mindlessness. In a movie like Scream (aka The Outing - not Wes Craven's) this just feels like lazy and incompetent filmmaking, however Bob Clark puts it across in a manner that makes you want to learn and know more and he teases you with revealing that you never will. His talents as a director certainly reached their peak with Black Christmas. Helped excessively by some great cinematography and neatly planned lighting effects that often evade the more recent slasher movies, Clark proved himself as a great filmmaker that would have his inspiration cemented over the years that followed. He produced fairly original ways to keep the killer obscured from view, whilst not forgetting the fundamental silhouette and shadow play. If you do predict the twists in the plot, then it's only because they have been carbonated so many times since this hit the shelves, that they now feel second nature to any horror fan. It's good to remember that this was one of the first to use these elements and you must also note how perfectly this holds up against the less than impressive attempts that have been released up to three decades after.Some brilliant supporting actors whom themselves would make their own slight impressions on the genre (Margot Kidder: The Clown at Midnight, Lynne Griffin: Curtains and John Saxon: Nightmare Beach and The Babydoll Murders) are sadly let down by a weak lead in Olivia Hussey. She's certainly not terrible, but at times her performance was fairly improbable when she could have found chances to shine. Kudos however to the actor(s) that performed the terrorising calls, I don't think titans like Brando or Nicholson could have played them any better! Credit has to be given to whoever helmed that crazy dialogue, for without it, the movie certainly would not have been so fearfully memorable! Perhaps a little further explanation on Peter's (Keir dullea) exact involvement may have helped make the end a little clearer, admittedly I was a little confused. Although I must confess that I can't be sure if that was my fault for not watching properly (it was late at night) or it was crafted deliberately to help cloud the mystery? But those gripes are hardly damaging and mainly I really enjoyed Black Christmas.The slasher genre has gained a reputation over the years for being somewhat over populated by incompetent/amateur filmmakers. But efforts like this, Halloween and The House on Sorority row prove that the category is a necessary ingredient to cinema history when it's handled properly; often able to generate superb and noteworthy results that rank up with any of horror's acclaimed pieces from the past. This has recently been re-released on DVD with minimal extras but maximum value for money and really does warrant a purchase. There's really not a lot more to be said to convince you, this is a true cult-classic and your collection is poorer without a copy. As stylish as the best Giallos and as disturbing as Friedkin's Exorcist, this is certainly worthy to hold its renowned status for years to come. Maybe next time you are bothered by a crank caller, you'll be a little more cautious as to how you handle the situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was really great to watch when I saw it last Christmas. I was expecting more of a "Halloween" type film, except the fact that the always brilliant Margot Kidder was in it. So I was into it from the start. The film follows a sorority house on the days proceeding Christmas when a psycho stalker starts getting into the house and, quite frankly, under the girls skin. Then the murders begin. Thesetting has been seen before, and so have the P.O.V. shots, but who cares?This film was scary anyway.Olivia Hussey is terrific and tense as the lead sorority sister, Jesse, who has the burden of dealing with all the other sisters' crisis problems. She looked really great too! And in the finale, she really played her role out for all it was worth.Kier Dullea was descent. A little too humble for the role, and not as, well,intimidating as he could have been. His scenes here are played out like a play. if not Broadway style, more conservative.Margot Kidder, being as good as she is, was not surprisingly fabulous! Hercharacter was the rough tough stuff sister who drinks, swears, and is the only one of them who has the guts to show off some glitz. The rest of the cast does just fine, particularly Andrea Martin as the soft spoken sister, John Saxon as the police chief who only wants to find the answer, and the actress who played Mrs. Mac was certainly worth the view too!Writing wise this film was greatly and adroitly planned. The central theme of this film is that you can't trust anyone, friend or foe, and the scares are genuine, and come psychologically, instead of in your face like "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th." Bob Clark is in love with his actors as he photographs them in brightexuberant colors, while his killer is photographed in jaundiced, grainy colors. All in all, a very artistic film and very creepy to the bone. Great atmospheric music too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a big fan of the horror genre, it takes an above average horror film to give me chills. This highly influential horror-thriller does just that, every time I see it!As a college sorority house empties out for the holidays, the remaining girls are unaware that a warped murderer has just climbed into their attic...Black Christmas is one of the most shamefully over-looked films in the slasher film genre, it's also been one of the most inspiring films of the genre. The story that drives this film is an extremely creepy one, taught with suspense, mystery, and an undying feeling of dread. It's also an intelligent story that wisely remembers that the unseen is scarier than anything one can put on film. Director Bob Clark builds an atmosphere of almost unnerving tension through out this film. Clark makes even the singing of Christmas carols very chilling. Adding even more to the sheer spookiness of this film is Carl Zitter's bizarre music score, which sounds as twisted as the killer's brain. A number of scenes from this film are simply unforgettable - the insane phone calls from the murderer, the glass unicorn stabbing, and my personal favorite, our heroine turning to see the killer's eye staring at her from behind the bedroom door.The cast of this film is great and contains a number of stars. The wonderful Olivia Hussey is sympathetic as our leading lady. Keir Dullea is strong as Hussey's boy friend, who's been behaving rather strangely. Margot Kidder provides some comic relief as the sorority bad-girl. John Saxon is solid as the police lieutenant who's trying to solve a murder. Supporting cast Marian Waldman, Andrea Martin, Art Hindle, and Douglas McGrath are terrific as well.Black Christmas has had a big hand in the slasher genre, such films as Halloween (1978), When a Stranger Calls (1979), and Friday the 13th (1980) were strongly influenced by this forgotten classic. For horror fans, Black Christmas is a must-see terror. I wouldn't recommend that you watch it alone in the dark though.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gothic suspense film noir at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Black Christmas" is truly a forgotten gem. Even though the producers intended the film for cinema, "Black Christmas" has the look and feel of its precursors, the made-for-television gothic suspense thrillers between 1969 and early 1974. This four year period featured inexpensively-produced but having hi-quality production values that older viewers will remember. These include, "A Howling In the Woods", "When Michael Calls", "How Awful About Allen", "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark", "Home for the Holidays", et al. "Black Christmas", produced at the tail-end of this short-lived genre, clearly displays the same suspenseful and moodily atmospheric elements involving human angst, fears, anxieties, and complicated, sometimes destructive relationships. In one small aspect, "Black Christmas" is a transitional film set between the television gothic supsense thrillers and the onset of the slasher genre epitomized by 1978's "Halloween" and 1979's "Friday the 13th". The violence was certainly more graphic than its television precursors, but not gratuitous. Foul language sprinkled throughout "Black Christmas" would never have made it past the television censors. And look again at "Halloween". It's reliance on atmosphere, moodiness, suspense, and the fright of awaiting something that is surely around the next dark bend of the house harkens back to the early 70s gothic thrillers. "Black Christmas" is from a unique genre long gone and will probably not return, but for those seeking quality shockers without the schlock will no doubt find repeat viewings of this suspense film noir satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film during the holiday season a few years back, and have come to the conclusion that "Black Christmas" is a neglected classic, and (in my opinion) is the first and best slasher film ever made. Guaranteed, fans of John Carpenter's "Halloween" will love this film, some may find they love it even more than "Halloween". And even though I thought I'd never say that, after viewing "Black Christmas" a few times, I found myself enjoying it much more."Black Christmas" starts off with a Christmas party at a sorority house. While the festivities are taking place, a stranger is breaking into the attic upstairs, while the unknowing sorority sisters are enjoying themselves. The phone rings, and we are introduced to Jessica (Olivia Hussey), our main character. A strange person on the phone makes obscene comments, speaking in different voices while the sorority sisters listen in disgust. As the sisters flood out, all leaving to visit family and friends and whatnot, only a few are left at the sorority house, among them are - Jessica, Barb (Margot Kidder), and Phyl (Andrea Martin). Clare (Lynne Griffin), a fellow sorority sister, has gone missing, and Clare's father comes to investigate along with the help of law enforcement and her friends. The strange phone calls continue, and get more and more disturbing as time goes by, until Jessica is forced to call the police. Could it be her boyfriend, Peter (Keir Dullea), playing some sort of sick joke? Or is someone watching the helpless girls from within the house? As the holiday nears, the psychotic killer sets in motion his bloody agenda, while the local police try and track him down before more murders are committed.Before Bob Clark went on to direct the family holiday classic "A Christmas Story", he took a darker look at the holiday season with this hidden gem. "Black Christmas" is a masterpiece horror film, and surprisingly predates the classics by many years, such as "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th", which get most of the credit for "creating" the slasher genre, when in fact this little Canadian chiller started it all. The plot was very original at the time, and contains some very scary moments - the scenes in the attic with the killer are among the scariest and strangest scenes I've ever watched, and the phone calls are flat out bizarre. The movie reeks a very dark, foreboding atmosphere (despite it taking place during the holidays) that never lets up throughout the film's entirety, as it slowly builds suspense before reaching the climax. It takes place during Christmastime, which honestly doesn't matter to the plot (it could've taken place at any time of the year), but the fact that it's set during such a joyous, festive season gives it a little more of a sinister quality, and makes it a perfect holiday horror movie.The acting in this film was excellent. Olivia Hussey is our lead, and she plays her character with vulnerability and innocence, putting the audience on her side the whole way. Margot Kidder plays the loudmouth, drunk sorority girl, and is also excellent in her performance, being a boisterous yet a likable character at the same time. Her character is probably the most memorable of the bunch. Andrea Martin plays Phyl, the quiet but friendly girl, and is also very good in her role. And Keir Dullea plays Jess's suspicious boyfriend well - the audience isn't sure if they should consider him a suspect or not, and he plays that perfectly. The rest of the cast includes numerous Canadian performers, all whom turn in convincing performances. There is even a little comedy thrown into the mix, an example being the alcoholic sorority housemother, Mrs. Mac., and her witty one-liners. The humor is subtle and is easily overlooked by the movie's grim demeanor, but it's in there for sure. The movie also contains some very creative death scenes (especially Barb's glass unicorn death, and the plastic attack in the closet), but even though these are present, it's really not a gory film, we mostly see the aftermath. The deaths aren't very bloody, tending to rely much more on sound, which is equally effective. One of the major things I admire about this movie is that the audience never knows who the killer is - he's kept a mystery, even at the shocking conclusion - the audience ever really gets a resolution and we aren't given any answers, something that I find to be very effective. I like the fact that we are given so little information on the villain, because it makes his presence much more terrifying. The tricky camera-work prevents us from ever seeing his face, in fact all we really see is his body shape, hair style, and his hands. We hear his voice though, as he harasses the sorority girls over the phone, muttering vulgar and disturbing phrases and making death threats (which were very well done, I might add). Even scarier, is the fact that he's hiding in the attic the entire time. This movie completely shatters the idea of feeling safe in your home... you can lock your doors and windows, but what if the killer is already inside the house, and you just don't know about it? Very scary concept. To sum things up, "Black Christmas" is an overlooked classic that deserves so much more recognition than it's gotten over the years - I'm sure any horror fan would love to find it in their stocking. Hopefully the upcoming remake will gain the original film some long-deserved attention. "Black Christmas" is the ultimate holiday-horror film for fans of the genre, and is the best slasher movie ever as far as I'm concerned. An underrated masterpiece. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple but Very Dark and Suspenseful Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Bedford, most of the girls of the sorority house Pi Kappa Sigma that is administrated by Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) travel in the Christmas holiday to the houses of their families. Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) schedules to meet her father on the afternoon; however, an intruder kills her in her room, hides her body in the attic and Mr. Harrison (James Edmond) never sees his daughter. Meanwhile Jess (Olivia Hussey) receives obscene anonymous phone calls while Phyl (Andrea Martin) and Barb (Margot Kidder) go to the precinct with Mr. Harrison to report that Clare is missing. Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller (John Saxon) is interviewing a mother that reported that her thirteen year-old daughter has never got home and the police organize a search party. When they find the body of the girl in a park, Lt. Fuller asks to bug the telephone of the sisters. Meanwhile the prowler has killed Mrs. Mac and is stalking the three sisters."Black Christmas" is a simple but very dark and suspenseful horror movie. The deranged serial-killer is never seen and the slightly ambiguous conclusion clearly indicated that Peter had nothing to do with the murders or calls, and the incompetent police officers do not find the bodies of Clare and Mrs. Mac. In 1979, the idea of a psychopathic killer calling from the inside of the house was brilliantly used in the creepy "When a Stranger Calls". The future Superman's girlfriend Margot Kidder is very beautiful but her character is completely fool. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Noite do Terror" ("Night of the Terror")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget about the 2006 version, THIS movie is where the terror really started. It's time for Christmas break, and the sorority sisters make plans for the holiday, but the strange anonymous phone calls are beginning to put them on edge. When Clare disappears, they contact the police, who don't express much concern. Meanwhile Jess is planning to get an abortion, but boyfriend Peter is very much against it. The police finally begin to get concerned when a 13-year-old girl is found dead in the park. They set up a wiretap to the sorority house, but will they be in time to prevent a sorority girl attrition problem?"Black Christmas" is that rare horror movie that gets everything right. This is a movie that just oozes atmosphere. Every frame is dripping with dread and setting the film on the Christmas just adds to the excitement of it all. Not only this but the film is also scary as hell with some excellent performances and an ending that is sure to give every horror fan chills. What is the most incredible aspect of this groundbreaking slasher film? Throughout the entire film, we see various sorority girls getting hacked to death and receiving strange telephone calls. What we don't see is our psycho, Billy. No motive, no reason, no face, no man..Billy could be anyone of us. If that doesn't make a true psycho, I really don't know what does."Black Christmas" is quite simply the best horror movie I've ever seen. Some give the credit to "Halloween" to being the first real American slasher film but that simply is not fair. "Black Christmas" did it first and did it better. It is the grandmother of the slasher film, four years before "Halloween". "Black Christmas'" power is impossible to deny; its characters are compelling, the imagery poignant, and the acting top- notch. If you haven't seen it yet, you are in for one scary "Christmas" treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silence is the scariest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have often wondered why there are so many bad horror movies these days. Movies that instead of focusing on suspense and real chills, just pour endless amounts of blood in your face, thinking this will do the trick, and hopefully become a cult classic. Film after film, more and more horror movies are becoming increasingly similar, and you can almost guess the whole entire plot of the movie, no more than 10 minutes into the film. Everything in horror these days is all about over the top special effects, numbingly loud thumping music, that is supposed to get you scared. Black Christmas (the original) is (IMO) one of the best and scariest horror movies ever made. Why? you ask. Let me tell you. There are so many reasons. First. In horror today, when someone (usually the pretty girl) is walking towards a door or a room (thinking someone will be there) - and they are. The film makers feel the need to spoil the moment with ridiculously loud music that is (intended) to get you all hyped up for the big surprise. When they don't realise that this spoils 99% of the scene. For instance, 10 minutes into the movie, one of the sorority girls "Claire" goes up stairs to her room, to pack some things, preparing for a trip. While entering the room she is greeted by the house cat "Claud". While packing, Claire hears a strange meow. At first she just ignores, but the meow gets more and more intense and chillingly creepy. She then notices that the meow is coming from the closet (not far from where she is standing) at the end of the room (and the closet door is open). She paces towards the closet (with a terrified stare) quickly realising that the meow is not coming from the house cat, asking "Who is that?" several times. The thing that makes this scene 'GOLD' is while walking to the closet and asking "Who is that?" there is no music! - just dead silence. This makes the scene and situation seem more real and 1000 times more scary. The viewers are at the edge of their seat, hanging on to pure silence while she walks further and further to the closet. This is far more terrifying than continuous loud music, that spoils the moment, because you know by the music when the killer is going to approach. That scene is horror at it's best and everyone should see the film for that scene alone. Secondly, the entrance of the movie is shocking. The camera is filmed like a documentary (like the camera is the stalker, walking nearer and nearer to the house) While spying on his victims he realises he is able to climb to the top of the house where he can enter the attic. The directer's captured this amazingly and it gave off that feeling, that raw, real, scare, that this really could happen to anyone. One of the standout scares and scenes that stick in your brain are the chillingly disturbing phone call scenes. The girls receive numerous phone calls from the same man, only there's a catch. It's not your typical Scream phone call were the killer asks "Are you alone?" and "What's your favourite scary movie?" he talks with himself, displaying what appears to be a severe split personality. The phone calls get more and more scary as the movie goes on. Especially near the end were the killer actually goes crazy portraying more than 4 different voices and characters - the horrific sound of his voice will haunt you after the movie is over (which I guess is great for the Creator, as all the best horror movies make long lasting impressions). The last thing I will say is there are a lot of people, reviewers, saying the end was disappointing because they still don't know who the killer is. Huh? lets get this straight. The killer isn't a person in the movie who is coming across nice, nor is he pretending to be a close friend - in fact he doesn't know any of the girls at all. He is merely a deranged, dangerous man who passed a sorority house and thought it would be fun to hide inside their attic and hack them off 1 by 1. I will not spoil the rest of the movie for those who haven't seen it. All I will say is if you want a great horror movie that when the credits role you will be afraid to walk upstairs, THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU. You will also be staring at your attic door for about a week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas =Merry Xmas...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst I was continuing on anti-Xmas crusade what better movie then to cap of the festive celebration with none other than Black Christmas. I bought the DVD a while back ago assuming that it was the 2006 version but by looking at the trailer thank god I got the original version and not the 2006 teen trashy version! Not much over here that is new but you can that a movie like this was the one that would set the 'rules' for future horror movies and slasher flicks. The movie goes straight into the action and does not waste in any time , although it does tend to drift off in a few places the good part was that we introduced to a tense atmospheric moment which but the tone right again. There also some genuine creepy moments that stand out and the odd funny moment here and there . There are also good uses of camera which helps dramatically to its quality and really make this movie stick out. Olivia Hussey was undoubtedly the star of the show but having said that Margot Kidder was amusing and John Saxon's performance was worthy as well. To conclude although Black Christmas did not exactly make my skin crawl , it did however jump out moments and also the fact that it annoyed some bible thumping Evangelical watching this makes me more happy as I hate Christmas and this movie just feels like a kick in the balls to old Santa, one definitely for horror movie fans who can do with some decent horror during this 'cheerful' holiday.BLACK Christmas: 6.8 OUT 10IF THIS MOVIE DOES NOT MAKE YOUR SKIN CRAWL ...

		<fullReview>I am probably not the BEST person to review this movie, as I have only seen it twice, but with this particular film, that's enough. It's creepy as hell. I am a major horror fan and because of that that statement is NOT an easy one for me to say. The phone calls from the killer to the girls freak the livin' shhh out of me! The voice sounds almost warped and garbled, uhh I am having chills now thinking about it! It's crazy that it was directed by the same man who did the perennial Christmas family fave "A Christmas Story" and "Porky's". All of the actors did a great job, especially Margot Kidder as the drunken sorority girl. She was my favorite, I think. Also in this is Andrea Martin, most recently famous for "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" as one of the girls. I watched it right around Christmas time and it freaked me out like y'all wouldn't even believe. Of all the Holiday-themed horror movies ("Silent Night, Deadly Night", "My Bloody Valentine", etc.) I think this is right up there with "Halloween". Major props to all involved, just DON'T watch this one at night OR alone, you think you will be able get to sleep? YOU WON'T!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this movie were to come out today, people would smirk. Seen that, done that. A horror movie in a sorority house? Gimme a break. The killer is revealed to be making phone calls from ... inside the house? Pfft. Bad things ... in the attic? Yawn. Cops don't have a clue? One girl's boyfriend is a weirdo with a violent streak? Could it be him? House mother is a tippler? Kitten with a clue? Killer POV? Who's that looking in windows? I could go on and on. Been there. And yet, if you care about horror movies, you really need to see this movie.It was released in 1974. That's four years prior to the 1978 release of "Halloween," which clearly borrowed from it. All subsequent slasher movies have borrowed from it. You can see a boatload of horror movie conventions being born here. Hell, even modern J-horror with its obsession with peeking eyeballs has borrowed from it.Bob Clark made a classic without really meaning to. It's a template for slasher movies to come. Cast highlighters: Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea (before 2001) and Margo Kidder.Make no mistake. This movie screams Seventies with hair, sideburns and ridiculous clothing (Dullea is in a turtleneck in every scene, which at that time broadcasted "sensitive artist").And let's mention the ending. Incredibly daring for the time. In fact, I wonder if it could be pulled off today when audiences demand ... something else."Black Christmas" is an outstanding B-movie and a piece of horror movie history. Approach it that way and you will be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before "Halloween," there was "Black Christmas"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is what a slasher flick should be. Four years before the unprecedented success of John Carpenter's landmark American horror film "Halloween" in 1978, there was this little gem from Canada called "Black Christmas," directed in 1974 by the late Bob Clark ("A Christmas Story," my #4 favorite film of all time and Clark's possible anti-thesis to this film), and was arguably the first true slasher film (1974 was also the same year that American filmmaker Tobe Hooper directed the landmark "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre")."Black Christmas" is an expertly directed horror film, there's no question about that. The story is incredibly simple, yet stylishly executed. It's deliberately and excellently paced by Bob Clark, who skillfully injects the film with a wicked sense of dread from the get-go, undercut with some slickly timed dark humor (a lot of which is actually quite hilarious). Said humor is appropriately biting and deserves some well-placed laughs but unlike most movies to mix comedy and horror, "Black Christmas" doesn't sacrifice one for the other. In other words, what starts out as a serious thriller doesn't devolve into a mindless, gore-filled slapstick comedy (like "Evil Dead II," which I love by the way). First and foremost, this is a horror film - a seriously effective and scary one at that.Upon having watched "Black Christmas," there's no doubt in my mind that John Carpenter and company watched this film at least once (and took some very, very good notes) and it most definitely played a hand in influencing the directorial style of "Halloween" (although it's widely known that Alfred Hitchcock's landmark 1960 thriller "Psycho" had the most influence on "Halloween"). (Even though I've never uncovered any information pertaining to this claim, anyone who watches "Black Christmas" and then re-watches "Halloween" will see some of the elements that undoubtedly influenced the latter film. I love "Halloween," by the way, and having this information on-hand makes me appreciate both films even more as seriously scary horror flicks.)What makes "Black Christmas" such an important staple in the horror genre is that a lot of the slasher movie elements that most likely first appeared in this film were later used, and popularized, by "Halloween" just four years later down the road. Most importantly, is the fact that many times throughout the picture, the film is shown from the point-of-view of an unseen killer. We many times see his actions as he goes about the prowl for potential victims, in this case the residents of the Pi Kappa Sig sorority house. We also hear his breathes as he stalks the house sisters, and he is always that unseen-but-always-felt presence in the room, like something horrible is lurking just out of sight in the shadows.The women of the Pi Kappa Sig house are preparing to leave for the Christmas holidays, but a few - Jess (Olivia Hussey), Barb (Margot Kidder), Phyl (Andrea Martin), and house mother Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) - decide to stay behind. However, someone has been making obscene phone calls to the house and scaring the living daylights out of the women. And it isn't long before the unseen presence begins to systematically eliminate the women in some particularly gruesome and creative ways. It's up to the police, led by Lt. Fuller (John Saxon), to try to find this psycho before he kills anyone else.Even though "Black Christmas" does feature some particularly gruesome and shocking scenes of murder and mayhem, it actually contains very little gore (it's possible that it, like "Halloween," took a few cues from "Psycho"), the film still works largely through the power of suggestion - like what you don't see is far more terrifying because your mind allows you to fill in the gaps. Additionally, there's also a very low body count.It's entirely possible that Olivia Hussey was probably the original scream queen, although, like the actress has said herself in interviews included on the 2006 special edition DVD, she actually doesn't do any screaming in the movie. All the characters in this film are three-dimensional and likable, especially Margot Kidder's drunken party-girl Barb. She was probably my favorite character. Kidder, who is probably most famous in the cinematic world for her work as Lois Lane in the "Superman" series films - "Superman II" (1980) saw her at her best, in my opinion - gets some of this film's best lines and also provides some of the best comedic moments. This is another aspect of "Black Christmas" that I find so ingenious: to create so many likable characters so it's much more tragic when the Unseen Killer begins offing them. It's just a shame that its many, many like-minded imitators (or even its 2006 remake) over the years didn't follow the same pattern."Black Christmas" is a film that I've wanted to see for a long time. All the good things I've heard about it are true. This is one scary fright flick that helped give birth to a new sub-genre of horror, and later influenced "Halloween," "Friday the 13th" (1980) and my favorite slasher flick of all time, "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984). It's also pretty funny, which admittedly, I was unprepared for, and made my appreciation for this film even greater. But make no mistake, the first order of business in "Black Christmas" is horror, and scaring the living daylights out of you, which it does in spades with suspense, easily identifiable and memorable characters (especially Margot Kidder - go, Margot!), Bob Clark's sharp direction, and minimal gore. So don't let its imitators fool you. "Black Christmas" is one holiday-themed horror film that has you re-thinking those yuletide celebrations.I dare you to watch it alone.10/10</fullReview>

Having worked in mental health, Billy's rage, hatred of women etc seems plausible (although exaggerated for dramatic reasons).It might seem slow paced with a lack of gore for some tastes, but I like my horror subtle and dark.My favourite DVD release of this is the critical mass special edition, although Dan Duffin's new release last year is well worth checking out, as is Australian release with the retro documentary (the name of that escapes me at the moment)Also check out www.itsmebilly.com</fullReview>

How do people make that kind of sound? what's the instrument or machine called? i have to know. olivia hussey is just dman beautiful in this movie, and margot kidder (who is equally attractive) is the one thing that made me calm down during the film during it's scary scenes...but then the movie f***s it all up and kills her off! now, i knew her character would die, but i didn't think so grotesquely. also, the ominous ending. why didn't the director choose to show Olivia Hussey die?

		<fullReview>OK, you've probably heard that Bob Clark's (RIP) "Black Christmas" is basically the original slasher movie, the inspiration for John Carpenter's "Halloween". Well, let me just say that - in response to the tag-line - my skin did actually crawl a little bit during some of the phone calls! Of course, that doesn't even begin to identify what makes this such a scary movie. Aside from not knowing the killer's identity, some of the scenes towards the end really catch you.But that's only one cool aspect. The cast includes Olivia Hussey (Juliet in "Romeo and Juliet"), Keir Dullea (Dave in "2001: A Space Odyssey"), Margot Kidder (Lois in "Superman") and John Saxon (Roper in "Enter the Dragon"); no doubt when Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea appeared in their most famous roles in 1968, they never imagined that they would co-star in this sort of movie. Director Bob Clark is most famous for "A Christmas Story" and the "Porky's" movies; seriously, what kind of person can lay claim to directing movies as different as these, plus "Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things"? But the main point is that this is the mother of all slasher movies. Like "The Jazz Singer" to sound, like "I Haven't Got a Hat" to the Looney Tunes, like "I Love Lucy" to sitcoms, everything started here. No matter how you look at it, "Black Christmas", for lack of a better word, is DA BOMB! Not only do the cast members truly have something about which to proud, but it goes to show what we lost when Bob Clark got killed in a car wreck earlier this year.PS: the special edition DVD includes an interview with Olivia Hussey (and she still looks quite good after all these years). She didn't see the completed film until many years later, as horror flicks scare her. Well, I think that it's practically a guarantee that at least one scene in this movie will scare you. Because as Olivia Hussey notes, the idea of there being something creepy out there is scarier than knowing what's there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God love Bob Clark for making great Christmas movies, whether there's death or not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the typically silly state of slasher movies today, considering that most of any of the popular ones are sit-'n-slash (Hostel, Wolf Creek, Turistas, you get the idea), it's nice to take a travel back in time when slashers were about mystery and the chase, not some hapless victim tied down to a chair with a chainsaw blade being fed into his or her rectum. Hell, Cube &amp; Saw kind of got the ball rolling on that, but at least those people had SOME kind of chance of living. Thanks a lot, Eli Roth. But I digress.Ah, the 70's slasher film. Is there anything more pure? Before the 80's came in and Friday the 13th perverted the original depth into mindless splatterfests, the slasher film moved on mood and atmosphere (Texas Chainsaw Massacre excluded, that movie is just f***in awesome). Bob Clark's Black Christmas takes the horror to not only a supposedly harmless environment such as the sorority house, but also to a holiday more harmless than baby holding a puppy that's licking a bunny. This harmless environment, in turn, gives the film and even more terrifying feeling, as if it was invading a world that God never intended it to cross into.All slasher villains have to have a gimmick, and have needed one ever since Michael Myers donned his stylish emotionless white mask. And although Myers will always be my favorite, Billy by far is the most intimidating one I've ever seen... er, "seen." Why? Because all he is is a voice, an eye, and a shadow. That's it. When's the last time you watched a horror movie and didn't see the monster? Billy has no gimmick, and he doesn't need one, because he is f***in creepy all on his lonesome. He doesn't even have a standard weapon! Don't worry, I won't tell Agnes what we did.As far as the acting is concerned, stellar performances all around. John Saxon was way on in the movie, more than he was in A Nightmare on Elm Street (easily). Margot Kidder was a great drunk (I'm sure she's experienced). To the main point: I was concerned for the safety of EVERY character, a MAJOR rarity in the slasher film. There's usually at least one or two meat puppets you're couldn't care less about, but not a single one in Black Christmas. If you can find one, tell me who it is! Black Christmas is everything that I wish slasher films today would be. Moody, dangerous, dreadful, and with more depth than just a knife into the chest, Black Christmas easily presents what the slasher movie needs to recapture. Please, untie that guy from the chair and give him a chance. You'll still get him, just make it at least SEEM like you're not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Plot = A group of young college girls decide to stick around they're sorority house for the Christmas holidays, not knowing a mysterious psychopath is hiding in they're attic, making obscene, disturbing phone calls, and that's just the beginning, he eventually proceeds to slaughter the kills one by one in a brutal fashion.Many consider Halloween as the first ever slasher movie but it isn't "Black Christmas" is but sadly this gem never managed the popularity "Halloween" and remained forgotten for years well until they made that not very good remake last year.Black Christmas was and still is bleak movie that packs a punch and gave me genuine goosebumps from beginning to end. I loved the dark imposing claustrophobic feel, the film handled its now known slasher formula like a freaking pro, tossing our way with full force moments of pure shock, a baffling whodunit, hard hitting plot twists and an expert use of the "killer is in the house" motif. The film's firm execution in terms of its conventions. Personally, the element that got under my skin the deepest had to be the killers' phone ramblings. I mean this dude was a hands down, to the core loon. He leaped into these bizarro monologues, taking on different voices (a man, woman, child), going on about things that only he understood while taking the random dramatic pause to slip in a heart felt "I'm gonna kill you" in there. What a CLASS ACT! The phone calls butcher boy (or girl) made, established him early on as one crazy mother to be reckoned with and since we never really got to see the lad throughout (apart from his heart warming toying with his victims' cadavers), that turned him into a constant thick cloud of doom spread wide about this tale. You didn't see him but man did you feel him! The acting was top of it's range in this movie Olivia Hussy (Jess) was solid from beginning to end, Keir Dullea (Peter) played his creepy, neurotic part well, I really enjoyed the house mother Mrs Mac she was great and stole every scene she was in, Margot Kidder was the stand out in this movie and brought in some much needed humor as the alcoholic and chain smoking drunk. Actors always come through when they play themselves. Another statement to that rule applied to John Saxon (LT Fuller) who once more played John Saxon...he was wonderful at it as per usual. Doug McGrath (Nash) was responsible for a few straight chuckles as the incompetent cop.Okay the murders may not be gory but they're still nasty and quite brutal like We get a girl being choked by a plastic bag, a semi blood wet stabbing and after the fact damaged corpses. Although not too graphic, the film still hit hard via the viciousness behind its dirty deeds.The directing was top notch Clark set up an unsettling dark mood from frame one, exploiting his creepy setting fully while giving us hints of slick style on the way (loved the killer POV shots and the slow motion). He also liked to inter-cut murder sequences with mundane events which made the scenes quite effective. And I have to give the man extra credit for two things: 1- That very scary shot of the eyeball (you'll know when u see it) killed me and the ending (which I won't dare give away) was brilliant.All in all Black Christmas is a definite cult classic because it's a well rounded horror flick.</fullReview>

But it makes you wonder what the hell were they think when they agreed to star in this snooze. It's long, it's boring, we never learn the identity of the killer of his motive. Near the end of the movie, the guy who was nothing but a Saint is killed and takes the fall for the killings, but the real killer is still lurking about the house and they never found the one girl who was killed with the plastic bag who still sits in the attic. Good thing the Police did such a intense search of the house. This is a stupid bad ending, I just pray the remake fixes the stupid ending of this crapper and I hope the stars remove it from their resume. I give it the LUMP OF COAL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christmas bells are snoring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the remake of When A Stranger Calls was out, obviously I was interested in watching the original. Then when I read about the original (which I recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day) I saw that the real money is on Black Christmas, which apparently beat everyone to the "the caller is in the house" punch. So I Netflix that, and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its "very long wait." All this time I am getting more and more eager to see it! Then one day, out of the blue, it finally arrives! ...And it's a total snore.Sure, maybe I had elevated expectations, but I don't think it would have gained more had I seen it fresh. The thing is it's Christmas in some Canadian college town, and there's this sorority having a party. We see some killer-POV shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic. So we KNOW he's in the house. Then we're introduced to our characters?-Olivia Hussey as the mousy, whiny, Canadian-accented Jess. Margot Kidder as the annoying, overtly aggressive alcoholic Barb. She's so annoying even her mother dis-invites her for her Christmas festivities. There's also this irritating Janis Ian clone ("Phil") and this alcoholic den mother Mrs. Mac, seen taking nips from the various bottles of booze she has stashed all over the house. We also meet Jess's highly-strung boyfriend Peter, played by Keir Dullea of 2001 and Bunny Lake is Missing fame, though halfway through the film I was still asking myself "Which one's Keir Dullea?"So it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls, but this was before email, so they couldn't ask him to send a photo. Then?-well, you know how they say those plastic dry-cleaning bags are not a toy? One of the sisters finds that out the hard way. Don't worry if you don't catch the first 14 shots of the plastic-encased corpse face as it reposes in the attic?-there'll be 28 more interspersed throughout the film, obviously there to make you say "Oh my God! There's a corpse in the attic!" Though after the first hour that changes to: "How come the dumb police haven't found the rather prominently-placed plastic-encased corpse in the attic?" Especially as it is made abundantly clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house. Really, any time before CSI came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime; the cops are so dumb. Fortunately some of them look like John Saxon.Anyway, after a lot more darn boring human drama, the house mother fears that her precious kitty has ascended a vertical ladder and has pushed open a heavy-looking trap door that rests atop it (those wily cats!), for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook pulley in her neck for the trouble. Now we have two corpses up in the attic?-hey, why don't we have 75 more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now TWO corpses in the attic?So by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously, and tap the houses' phone and station a cop outside. They inform Jess and her pal Janis Ian that if the obscene caller calls back, they need to keep him on the phone. Jessica, who has grown even more whiny, mousy and annoying keeps asking the caller "Who is this? What do you want? Who are you?" after like the first 89 calls, when it is clear that he is not going to answer her. Isn't that like a sign a developmental disability? The inability to learn from unsuccessful attempts at something? And what's he going to do, suddenly say "Oh yeah, hi, it's Bob from the Laundromat?" Dumb Jess.Spoilers! Anyway, soon Janis Ian and Lois Lane (Kidder) are piled in bed with ketchup splashed on their faces (this film's idea of gore), and idiot Jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked. Hello? Are you being stalked or what? Then the cops realize that the killer is in the house, and call Jess and tell her "don't ask questions, just do as I say? walk to the front door and get out." So what does moron Jess do? Starts screaming "Phil? Barb? Phil? Barb?" Hey, great idea sister. Now why don't you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking? Of course she does, and sees her former friends, all splashed with ketchup, prompting this viewer to scream at the screen: "Have a clue now?!"Now, obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place, and that it doesn't move to the same pace we're used to, and seeing a plastic-covered corpse in the attic like 206 times probably WAS scary back in the day, and people weren't used to being stalked by psychopaths, so they wouldn't think to, you know, lock the doors or windows. And they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there. You see, people were stupid back in the 70s. We have to understand that. One of the big shocks is that we don't even see our proto-Final Girl kill the psycho. But believe me, that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for.

		<shortDescription>a true classic in both style and substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the original black Christmas from the year 1974 directed by Bob Clark is a slasher classic. before john carpenters Halloween black Christmas really set the bar high for how good a slasher movie can be. I tend to go back and forth on which film I prefer but most of the time I do like this film better. it is a very stylish and slick film with a brisk pace that keeps you indulged in what's happening on screen. the atmosphere is genuinely chilling and the Christmas setting is used to deliver some dark and unique tones, which is impressive. most of the time when a Christmas setting is involved we are treated to more of a campy and fun style, but this film grits its teeth and stays dark and mysterious. the score is also great and complements the films visual style and setting very well. adding to the already intense and enthralling atmosphere. not only is the atmosphere an excellent aspect of the film but we also get some genuine suspense in multiple scenes. I'm aware that the film is old but for those of you that haven't seen it I won't spoil anything for you, but I will say that there are a few chilling scenes that really show us that bob Clark knows what he is doing behind the camera. he knows what to show and when to show it to get maximum effectiveness out of each scene. so of course this means the camera work is wonderful and another aspect of the film that is a true strength. the acting is also very good, john saxon, margot kidder, Olivia hussy, and keir dullea all give excellent performances. their characters are by no means complex but for what they have to work with they do, do an exceptional job. even the supporting cast are pretty good, especially considering for the most part they are all no name actors with little to no experience to my knowledge. the killer in the film is also a very memorable and iconic villain and his phone conversations with the sorority girls are definitely disturbing and riveting.in truth there really isn't anything wrong with the movie I give it a perfect 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there anything creepier?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little Canadian film has to be my favorite slasher film. While Michael Meyers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface &amp; Chucky have all become horror icons the killer in this has not. Its understandable. You never actually even see the killer which makes it all the more creepy and makes anything he does unexpected.The acting in this film is very solid. Olivia Hussey does a good performance as the "head of the sorority girls" as does Margot Kidder. The height of acting has to go to the voice of the killer. He is probably the creepiest horror antagonist ever. The way he uses 6 or 7 different voices while talking to them and the fact that when you first hear him, he's talking about raping them. There is nothing creepier to me than that.Anyway, the plot is that a sorority house has these disturbing calls from this "psycho" and they ask to put a trace on where the calls are coming from, but not before a few girls turn up missing.The part that really got me on the edge of my seat was when they completed the trace and you realized "hey, the calls are sent to this address but they're also coming from it too", something that other horror directors would shamelessly use as a cliché in future horror movies such as "When A Stranger Calls".Overall this has to be the creepiest movie I have ever seen (and I am more or less a "horror junkie") and I highly recommend this to fans of films such as "A Nightmare On Elm Street", "Halloween" &amp; "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob Clark's game-changing slasher is also a great Christmas movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second instalment of my (diminishing) 'Shitty Christmas' film selections, not only is the late Bob Clark's Black Christmas a perfectly mean spirited holiday movie, it's a highly influential horror.It's the week before Christmas break at a quaint American college campus. With red wine being sloshed and chestnuts roasting on an open fire, the festivities turn fearsome when a killer is let loose inside a sorority house. With each of the female tenants meeting their timely fate, it's up to damsel in distress Jess (Olivia Hussey) to put her abortion debate with boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea) aside, and catch the killer herself.I love Black Christmas. Even if time hasn't aged it well, it's still the perfect remedy of genuine scares and humorous bravado, without ever being trashy or pastiche. It's great fun to spot the standardised tropes we've all become used to in horror movies. And wow, there are so many here including horny young girls, implausible 'don't go in there!' plot points, seven absurd fatalities, melodrama screams and glimmers of German expressionism, maniacal phone calls, a stoic detective, an Oedipally complex serial killer and, best of all, Carl Zittrer's clamorous score which comines distorted sound of cutlery clanging together and ominous analogue synths.Alongside all this genuinely nuevo scares, horrophiles will relish in spotting the homages Bob Clark fits into the movie, with callbacks' to the POV killings from Michael Powell's Peeping Tom, psychoanalytical paranoia stemming from Hitchcock's handbook, and the same eerie claustrophobia as Robert Siodmak's fantastic 1945 mystery The Spiral Staircase.Far from formulaic, Bob Clark's Black Christmas is the precursor to the Slasher sub-genre it would spawn, and it's still better than most of it's derivations today. Like John Carpenter's Halloween, with added eggnog. Great stuff!Read more and watch it here: http://366movies.com/2012/12/15/349black/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prototypical and exemplary slasher-film with a realistic and suspenseful atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say 'Slasher Film' and most people will probably say 'Scream', 'Friday the 13th', or 'Halloween'?what's more, most will probably be referring to the franchises each of these has spawned rather than have a particular movie in mind. The fact that (despite the inevitable and tired re-make) most people don't know about/haven't seen 'Black Christmas' is certainly criminal as in terms of chills, suspense, and quality of filmmaking it is far ahead of virtually every other film in the slasher genre. What's more, 'Black Christmas has the prestige of being (after respectful nods have been made towards 'Silent Night. Bloody Night' and some Italian gialli) the film which kick-started the genre.As befitting a slasher film, the set-up will be familiar: a group of teenagers, here composed of a group of Sorority girls and a few boyfriends, are picked off one-by-one by a maniacal killer. In addition, other slasher tropes like the menacing phone-calls-coming-from-inside-the-house, the holiday theme, and the (kind of) final girl really do put most viewers in a state where surprises are not to be expected. However, 'Black Christmas' certainly raises itself above the imitations that followed in presenting a realistic and engaging atmosphere which captures the suspense of what is, when looked at without cinematically desensitized eyes, a scary idea: a mentally deranged person killing without apparent motive. The realistic touch comes from the pared down direction which is reminiscent (or should that be prescient?) of Carpenter's approach in Halloween, the time taken to build up a relationship with the characters, the absence of over-the-top Tom Savini-style "kills" (which have the effect of distancing the viewer from the fact that someone has died), and a thankful absence of the strained conservative moral message that teenagers should listen to adults and avoid drugs and sex before marriage etc.It is a wonder this film is not more widely recognised. I believe it is due to the fact that it doesn't present us with a tangible figure of fear like Myers, Voorhees, Freddy, the Fisherman, or Ghostface etc who, even though masked, nonetheless localise and personify fear and in doing so suggest ways to combat it. In contrast, 'Black Christmas', apart from a startling eyeball shot, offers us nothing to hang our fear (and our consumerist franchise fetishes) on. As such, while 'Black Christmas' and its killer may not have entered the pop-culture lexicon, this has meant that the film has retained its power and sense of discomfort and maybe, like the killer, the film belongs in the periphery where most people don't look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie. Its one of the first real 'slasher' films, and very well done. Its about a group of sorority girls who receive menacing phone calls on Christmas break, and eventually begin getting picked off one by one, by an unseen killer who has been hiding in the attic of their sorority house. The plot seems simple, but it is a very great creepy horror flick, that paved the way for the many slasher movies to come in the 1980's, and deserves more attention that it surprisingly, doesn't get. The phone calls through out the movie are very creepy, and the movie is very atmospheric, and its clear this was an inspiration for John Carpenters horror classic, Halloween, which is much more well known. While I love both of these films, I'm going to go ahead and say BLACK Christmas is better. If you enjoyed Halloween, then you will most likely enjoy this as well. This is a horror classic, that should be seen by everyone, even if they aren't horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch seasonal horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those movie lovers who appreciate the subversive take of the horror genre on the Yuletide season, "Black Christmas" is one of the all time great Christmas themed chillers. Producer / director Bob Clark, who'd already done the cult favourites "Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things" and "Dead of Night" (a.k.a. "Deathdream"), would move away from the genre after this, but certainly ended this string of titles with one of the best and most memorable on his resume. Of course, he would return to Christmas fare almost a decade later with the much more upbeat "A Christmas Story"."Black Christmas", written by Roy Moore, tells the story of a sorority house being menaced during the holidays by a stealthy and supremely creepy psycho, identified as "Billy", about whom we never really learn much, and who's kept off screen or in shadow the entire time; the only part of him we ever clearly see is his eye. It remains to be seen if the few girls remaining in the house (most have left for their vacations) can survive the ordeal.It has naturally been mentioned many times how certain elements in this story would be popularized in subsequent movies like "Halloween" and "When a Stranger Calls". If one is already familiar with slasher movies before viewing this movie for the first time, they can hardly fail to notice that it won't play out in a way they're used to; the final girl in this case is nice enough but hardly "innocent". The atmosphere both in and outside the house is excellent (Carl Zittrer's music is a big help in this regard); Clark goes for a largely subtle approach, emphasizing the atmosphere and creepiness, utilizing a little bit of gore but mostly going for a classic "old dark house" type of feeling. The sense of humour is a great asset, as well, with scene stealing Margot Kidder, as the vulgar sorority sister Barb (who also displays a touching vulnerability at one point) supplying much of it. Douglas McGrath as dim bulb police officer Sargeant Nash and Marian Waldman as secret drinking house mother Mrs. Mac are both a hoot. Lovely Olivia Hussey of "Romeo &amp; Juliet" fame is leading character Jess, who already has her own problems to deal with, including her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea of "2001: A Space Odyssey"), a temperamental musician. Andrea Martin is wonderfully appealing in a very straight performance as her friend Phyl. And John Saxon has a great presence here as the compassionate and dedicated Lt. Fuller. Fans will also recognize actors such as Art Hindle ("Invasion of the Body Snatchers" '78, "The Brood"), Les Carlson ("Deranged", "Videodrome"), and Lynne Griffin ("Curtains", "Strange Brew") in supporting roles. The movie builds slowly to a scary climax, which actually isn't quite as scary as the ultimate reveal right at the end, that plays out behind the closing credits, which help to cement this movie's status as a horror classic. While it was a hit here in Canada in its time, it did take a while for its reputation to grow elsewhere. It's one of the movies I would easily recommend to new fans of the horror genre. 37 years later, it still works extremely well.Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film came out when I was eleven years old and I remember sneaking into the local theatre to see it, as it was rated restricted at the time. I didn't sleep for days afterward! I now own the collectors edition of film and watch it at least once a year. My 19 year old son is somewhat of a film buff himself and I had him watch it with me a few years back for the first time. He was very impressed with it as well.Margot Kidder puts in a winning performance as Barb, the lonely attractive, abusive and constantly drunk sorority sister who flirts with anything in pants. Olivia Hussey is convincing as Jess, the lead female, who has to deal with a pregnancy, a highly strung piano playing boyfriend, and a weirdo who calls on the phone.One thing that really bothered me in this film - I wish Peter would have gotten rid of that coat. Fashion statement, NOT! ;o) I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas isn't the horror film that started it all. In fact, it isn't even perfect horror to begin with, however, it's certainly one not to be missed. Directed by Bob Clark, creator of the childhood comedy A Christmas Story, Black Christmas is undeniably a somewhat agitated and graphic film for the time it was made. It features above marginal acting as well from Margot Kidder, John Saxon, Keir Dullea and Olivia Hussey. The film has a great advantage though of good acting by the female leads played by Kidder and Hussey and there isn't a lot of gore, which proves Clark relies on good Hitchcokian suspense to scare, making the film not to be hampered by typical gatutus sex, nudity, gore, or sleaze.The story is about an obscene phone caller that dials up a sorority house. Finally the police trace the calls... and he's in the house!!!! Along the way, Black Christmas has the sorority girls go vanishing one by one. Still they don't really get it, going about their drunken holiday revelry without a care. The movie has several very interesting plot twists, but perhaps for new viewers it's now predictable and sometimes frustrating, such as the entire concept that we never really see the killer, who hides in the attic the entire time. Suspicions are cast on the crazy-boyfriend-as-a-potential-suspect (Dullea) of the coed (Hussey) that survives the longest, but his creepiness is never fully explored.Overall, while Black Christmas is innovative but made a strong attempt at suspense and terror, it would easily inspire many latter-day horror movies like Student Bodies, When a Stranger Calls, Silent Night, Deadly Night, Halloween, just to name a few, its progeny wouldn't always improve on the formula. Highly recommended!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the recent remake was a fairly enjoyable film in its own right, it is no where near as effective as the original film. I don't think that the similar ties to this and Halloween matter all that much they are different enough and they each build up the atmosphere of dread in their own way.I think that Black Christmas is the better film, the acting and direction in this film is excellent and the film takes its time to build the sense of danger rather than have the killer hacking his victims from the opening credits. The murders in this film are also more effective than in the remake because you don't see that much, the violence is implied rather than shown and it is far more shocking than anything in the remake.The fact that you don't know who Billy is or why he is stalking the girls in the house makes him a far more creepy and disturbing killer than those in the films that have followed Black Christmas - the unknown is far more scary than what you see, hence why all the slasher sequels in the 80's and 90's where not really that good when they start to focus more on the killer and less on the victims.The ending was nice and vague and I'm glad there was never a sequel as it allows you to ponder what happened after the credits rolled. To me the film has aged very well, even if the quality of the picture hasn't whether those who are used to the made slashers and repulsive gore of recent films will like it I don't know, but for me this is a classic well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the most genuinely terrifying movies I have ever seen! There are many terrifying aspects of this film. The soundtrack is horrifying with it's various screams, vocals, and the constant Twang of the piano. The atmosphere is haunting with the various camera angles showing you the killer's point of view and the consistent image of the first victim in the rocking chair with the plastic bag still wrapped around her head flashing across the screen at various moments and then there's the telephone calls. The terrifying screams, moans, and various voices that the killer uses during these calls will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. The most terrifying aspect of this film though is the fact that you never find out who the killer really is. The viewer is lead down a particular path and falsely believes that they know the identity of the killer but then the film betrays the viewer. This is sheer cinematic genius and one of the essential elements for true terror. This film set the benchmark for future films such as "Halloween" "Friday the 13th" and "Nightmare on Elm Street"...ESSENTIAL VIEWING!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The father of the slasher genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas tells the story of a group of girls in a sorority house who are getting obscene calls from a mysterious man. The calls grow increasingly more macabre as the film moves on. Soon, a girl in the sorority goes missing, and everybody goes on the search while the calls continue. There is a killer on the loose, and as time moves on, he grows more and more blood hungry...Black Christmas isn't the best slasher movie ever made, but it's the movie that started it all, and for that it deserves respect.Black Christmas borrows it's basic plot from the most famous urban legend of all time, and adds a bunch of characters and plot developments to make it more interesting. The plot is pretty good for a low budget slasher movie, and it's still creepy today. Many of the devices used in most slasher movies came from this film including the point of view shots and the tension building silences. Though Halloween started the slasher boom of the 80s, it wouldn't have been made the way it was had it not been for Black Christmas, and fans of Halloween should recognize that. The movie uses many creepy build up scenes to build tension and makes the smart choice of never showing the killer's face. We only get to hear his deeply disturbed voice through phone calls, and an eyeball through the shadows. It is especially creepy that we have no knowledge of the killer's identity or his motive, however a motive can be put together by anyone with an imagination through the phone calls. Bob Clark, who went on to do the famous Christmas film A Christmas Story, did a very good job with this film.The acting is pretty good. Keir Dullea gave an intense performance, and Canadians Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin were both funny and dramatic.Overall, Black Christmas isn't a great classic, but it was the first slasher movie ever made, and it is the reason that most slasher movies are the way they are.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often you find a movie so scary as this. There was no fun about it, it was just non-stop scary and it's probably one of the best horror movies of all time. They all say that Halloween was THE horror movie but I tell you after you watch this movie, you'll change your mind. If you think that horror movies are not really scary and you're just wasting your money, rent Black Christmas and you'll literally be screaming through the movie. With The Omen you can have fun with it because it can't happen but once you watch this murder-massacre movie, you'll want guards behind your house. There were some excellent performances by Olivia Hussey as the main character and Margot Kidder was a supporting actress in this movie. In my opinion it was scarier than "The Exorcist" and should have won Oscars for Bob Clark for "Best Director", Olivia Hussey for "Best Actress" and Margot Kidder for "Best Supporting Actress". This movie makes other scary movies look like comedies. Once you watch it, you'll remember it forever!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pre-dating what is generally considered the ultimate Slasher film by several years - the original "Halloween" - "Black Christmas" is a highly-underrated, and amazing horror-slasher flick which would set the standard for practically every slasher film to follow - from the ringing telephones, the 'don't go upstairs', re-hearings and of course a strong female lead."Black Christmas'" strong female lead is the equally underrated Olivia Hussey, whose fantastic accent is a special bonus to her calm and sympathetic character Jessica. While the majority of slasher films all feature a female lead (though there are exceptions like "A Nightmare on Elm Street 2", "Prom Night 3: The Last Kiss" and "Friday the 13th VI: Jason Lives" which all have a male lead) not every female lead is as terrific as Hussey's Jessica. (Exceptions being Neve Campbell's Sidney from the "Scream" Trilogy, Heather Langenkamp's Nancy from "A Nightmare on Elm Street", Lar Park-Lincoln's Tina from "Friday the 13th VII: The New Blood" and of course Jaime Lee Curtis' Laurie from various "Halloween").Jessica's resourcefulness, and cool personality makes her a character that you really care about, and the fact that she has various real life stories going on (abortion for example - something I don't think has been featured in a slasher since "Black Christmas") makes her a very likable character. The majority of the characters in "Black Christmas" are actually very realistic and likable. Margot Kidder's Barbie provides a lot of the comic relief, but has the most tragic death also. Andrea Martin is excellent as frizzy-haired (though its nice frizzy-hair) Phyllis. John Saxon is always great in his performances, and his role as Lt. Fuller is no exception. Keir Duller does a good job of playing perhaps the most unlikeable, but very realistic, Peter, Jessica's over-bearing and high-strung boyfriend. Marian Waldman is a riot as the house-mother for the sorority girls, Mrs. Mac.The plot, pacing and general story is probably nothing new to anyone who has seen "Scream" or "Halloween", as previously mentioned, many slashers take a least a note or two from "Black Christmas", which does everything splendidly. Great direction, interesting camera angles, a couple of good jump scenes, and then there's the telephone calls...perhaps one of the most disturbing things in all slasher movies.So overall, "Black Christmas" is an amazing slasher-horror film, setting the stage for a myriad of followers over the years, but thirty years later, does not seem out-dated or cheesy. Sure, there's not a lot of gore, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. And for the pre-cursor to the likes of "Halloween" and "Scream" to be this good, then it's certainly worth a watch, even if just to watch for all the things in the film that will eventually become standard conventions in slasher films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Black Christmas" is an important movie for the Horror genre because it generates opinions of all kinds. People might love it or might not find the greatness about it. Many other people haven't even watched it. But something for sure is that the movie is one of the most important moments in Horror history. A killer on the loose terrorizes an all girl Sorority House with obscene/disturbing phone calls. Little do they know that the deranged killer is hiding in the attic. The believed prank calls take another twist when the caller threatens to death one of the girls. To make things worse, a local young girl is raped and murdered by a killer on the loose. Could it be that it's the same man that is making the calls? The first phone call presumes that a girl has been raped because the caller uses obscene language towards a girl's intimate parts and later makes sounds involving a choking. This all happens on Christmas eve! To make things worse, the hider manages to get down the attic and murder one of the sorority girls. This is where hell breaks loose. Then, one by one these girls and their housemother find terrible fates at the hands of the deranged intruder. The calls continue but each time get nastier and scarier. Police traces the calls and find the shocking truth: the calls are coming from inside the house. It seems that the housemother had two different lines in the house. One of the extensions was in the attic, where nobody would ever enter. The attic is filled with old, dusty toys and old furniture. Also, there are photographs that may be from the killer's family. It seems that the killer lived there before it was used as a Sorority House. The atmosphere surrounding Christmas is more than tense. First, the missing girl that later is found dead, then the missing sorority house girl that seems to have vanished from earth but nobody knows that her dead body is wrapped in plastic, sitting on a rocking chair in the attic!. The prime suspect is Peter, the boyfriend of one of the sorority girls. Many clues lead to believe that he's doing the phone calls but nothing is sure. Meanwhile people wonder what's going on, 7 people have been murdered by a mysterious lunatic. A series of events lead to a confrontation with Jesse and the hider from the attic (who's name is believed to be Billy). Will police come before Billy kills Jesse? How will things end in this mysterious situation? Who really is Billy? Watch "Black Christmas"'s ending to make your own conclusions. Your brain will have a hard time trying to figure out a satisfactory conclusion. What a fantastic suspenseful, mysterious Horror movie this is. The events are displayed in a suspenseful way that increases the scare factor. There are very tense moments that carry the whole movie. The highlight is the infamous, classic moment of the "eye in the closet". That's one of the most frightening moments in Horror history; not because of what's visually displayed, but because what it means for the movie. Also, the phone calls are incredibly disturbing, nerve tensing, and can scare the audience without showing anything. The voices are chilling plus the obscene dialog and yells add more tension to the situations. This is a sui generis movie that has been copied over the years. The acting is perfect. Olivia Hussey delivers a believable, tender, strong, performance as Jesse. She knows really how to scream and how to deal with a maniac. I totally bought it. She was perfect enough to carry the whole film. Special mention for Margot Kidder as the drunk, rebel Babs. She was the comedic part of the movie. Too bad she found such a terrible fate. Keir Dullea plays really good his part as Peter, the paranoid but aggressive boyfriend. The man's acting is powerful. And John Saxon did his all time role perfectly. He can't do wrong. The rest of the cast is great. Marian Waldman and Andrea Martin play supporting roles at perfection. You really feel bad for the characters as you get to know them and generate feelings towards them. The death scenes are perfectly done. There's minimal gore but the scenes are very effective. The glass unicorn death scene is a classic scary moment. As many people know and recognize, BC set the standards for the slasher genre. John Carpenter's "Halloween" is obviously inspired on BC. The killer's POV, the score, the Holiday setting, the situations, etc. Carpenter centered his movie on the killer, giving him a personality while Bob Clark used the killer as an element to increase the tense atmosphere. Black Christmas is a perfect Horror movie. First of all (and most important) it is scary, tense, suspenseful and dark. There ain't no room for Christmas miracles or presents. The killer is as menacing as you can get. Probably the most deranged villain on these kind of movies. I wanted though to know more about him but that's what makes this movie great: that you can figure out whatever you want. Your imagination may create a creepier situation that the real one. The ending is great. It leaves too much for your imagination and still is scary. Watch this gem and give it the credit that it deserves because it's one of the most important, influential Horror movies of all time. No room for Christmas songs or Santa Claus, "Black Christmas" will send up shivers up your funny bone. Believe all the hype towards it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of sorority girls are preparing themselves for the holiday season, but there festival spirits are short lived when suddenly they're plagued by a prude caller making obscene comments and later the next morning one of the girls have gone missing. Worried about the girl, her father and her friends go to the police for help and the detective involved discovers that maybe the girls' disappearance, a murder of a child and that of the obscene phone calls share a common interest.I remember when I use to think that Halloween was the begin all and end all of slashers and even to a extend horror films. Though, that was up until I discovered this Canadian little gem. Well, this has got to be one of my favourite horror films I've come across and I finally got around to updating my video copy to that of DVD. It's one of a few horror flicks that still are able to raise goosebumps whenever I watch it.Simply this is an old-fashion horror tale working with atmospheric subtleness and conjuring up such a sombre mood, where it's exhausting in its slow-building suspense. You might think that it all sounds familiar and it sure does, as you could class this as a blueprint for the slasher genre. Yes, before 'Halloween' was even thought up this film was setting up the trend to come, just that 'Halloween' was advertised better than 'Black Christmas' and from that pick up momentum in its popularity. It was one of the first films to cook up these standard clichés and stereotypes you find in these movies. But when compared with most in its field this story will rather deal with atmosphere than violence, and that didn't bother me because director Bob Clark did a sensational job in keeping this slow-burner genuinely gripping with many effectively memorable scenes. The violence is rather timid and implied with little blood, therefore it goes for a psychological imprint by leaving in up to your imagination to picture what happened off screen, although there are two deaths we do see, which stand out in a very stylistic manner. Actually a lot of things are left up in the air, leaving you to use your own insight to come up with the answers and images. Sometimes the uncertainty of the outlook can work against you, but here it seems to fit in neatly. I thought the whole ambiguity of our killer (we don't even see him and there's no motive) and that of the ending goes down well, but it's one of those ones you'll like or be totally disappointed with.The customary plot focus basically that of a few collage students where we learn some elements (the abortion issue) that drive the motivation factor that's formed around its murder-mystery tone. I really wouldn't say it's a straight-forward stalk and slash film, because the mystery of the disappearance, murders and the obscene phone calls seem to level out instead of focusing on one particular aspect. This helped woven a nice dose of reality to the situation and characters. Now what does take front stage, are definitely the blood-curdling phones in a perversely harassing manner. The jittery voice(s) and the lurid context being said over the phone are intensely unnerving. It might build on its high-strung suspense, but the in the script there's a nice amount of amusing dark humour that's worked in with great timing. The character's interactions and perks are believable and the chemistry amongst them was more than sound. The performances were great (there's no bad exceptions) with each one fitting their roles perfectly. I would even go to say that there wasn't a weak character in the main leads, as they all had their own complexities and contain strong personalities. Margot Kidder stands out as alcoholic lout Barbie and you've got the also impressive John Saxon as the more than competent Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller. Olivia Hussey is gorgeous as the concerned, but strong-willed Jessica and Keir Dullea nails down her irrational boyfriend Peter.Director Clark draws tightly such a dreaded mood with the wintry backdrop and within that of the almost empty and bleakly lit sorority house. The dark presence of this house just takes you out of your comfort zone with its hidden layers. There's prominent work in the camera placement that moves well with the sweeping shadows roaming the house and the POV shots are eerily staged to perfection with the constant heavy breathing backing it up. They provide some quite inventive shots, as there's a lot of movement going on in the panning and frame shots. The chilling but underplayed piano score knows when to make the sudden whispers turn into quick rush of terror and the sound effects played a big part by chiming with preciseness to make you feel hellishly uneasy. Even when it's dead silent with only the ruffling winds it still succeeds in stamping a terrifying mark. It's clearly a dynamic catalyst of the genre! A truly stark and quite stylish horror film that gets under your skin by suffocating you with a heavy blanket of menace. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily the scariest movie I have ever bore witness to, even to this day, Black Christmas set the standard for the "slasher movie." I could drone on for hours about how much I enjoy this movie, but I'll try to keep this short. If you don't know the plot, here it is: Sorority house during X-mas break, where we learn the girls have been receiving obscene phone calls, inter-mixed with some unknown intruder scaling up a wall to an open attic window. What follows are some of the most intense, and downright harrowing phone calls, switching from sexual innuendos and pig noises, to what seems like different characters screaming out names that make no sense (not at first, anyway). The story progresses with Jess (Hussey), seeming to be the recipient of the calls, telling her boyfriend Peter (Dullea) that she is pregnant, but does not want to keep the baby. Peter flips out, and starts to act a little cuckoo himself. Enter John Saxon as Lt. Fuller, who while investigating the disappearance of a 12 yr. old girl, keeps a tab on the strange calls coming in to the sorority house. I'll leave it at that, as the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat until the harrowing ending, which answers nothing and everything at the same time. If you haven't watched this film yet, go find it now. It is well acted, intense, and at times flat out disturbing. This is proof that all the crap that's being thrown out today cannot hold a flame to a movie that was made 30 years ago, with no sex, and limited on-screen violence. What makes this movie is the fact that the killer is never shown, and you really have to pay attention to his babbling on the phone, and with your imagination you can start to piece together why this dude is really off his rocker (no pun intended!). Please keep in mind that this movie predated Halloween, Friday the 13th, etc... by quite a few years, and you can notice some of the quirks that would become standards of these types of movie. However, none have, and ever will, match the creepiness of the "eyeball scene" and others. It still gives me nightmares. In closing, this is more of a serial killer movie than anything else, and when you think about people like Ted Bundy who actually went into a sorority house in Florida, and killed young women, it just makes it all the more terrifying.If you have an attic, nail the door shut.9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's actually as good, if not better than all the reviews that made me see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge movie fanatic and horror is one of my favorite genres. Horror films from the 70s to the present are my favorite, but it's usually quite difficult to find the good ones amongst all the junk. I had gotten to the point to where I thought I had seen all of the great horror pictures of this time period...including...THE CHANGELING, AN American WEREWOLF IN London, THE DEAD ZONE, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, EVIL DEAD 2, THE THING (1982), HALLOWEEN, THE SHINING, SUSPIRIA, THE DESCENT, DEAD-ALIVE(aka BRAINDEAD), THE EXORCIST and THE BROOD...to name a few, so obviously I was skeptical that this film BLACK Christmas that had passed me by for almost my whole life could actually be as good as all my fellow IMDb reviewers were stating. But being a huge fan of Bob Clark's A Christmas STORY, I took a chance and purchased this DVD right out and to my surprise all of the hype didn't even begin to do this film justice. It's been compared to HALLOWEEN and John Carpenter's film is certainly one of the best of the genre but BLACK Christmas...dare I say it...is actually better..scarier and more original. First of all I was impressed by how good the film looked for its age. BLACK Christmas is a class act, with pretty fine actors, a great script and an excellent crew behind the camera. It's hard for a film to scare me after all the films I've seen but my wife and I were often creeped out by BLACK Christmas. There is very little gore and you don't see much of the killer which proves sometimes less is more...WAY MORE in this case. BLACK Christmas is now in my top five of all time horror flicks. See it if you like a good scare. BOO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directer: Bob Clark, Script:Roy Moore, Cast: Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, Keir Dullea, John Saxon.This is one of my all time favorite horror/slasher/thrillers. It is about a group of sorority girls that are being terrorized by a psychopath. Christmass vacation has just started in this small college town(actually Toronto!) so most of the girls have left the sorority house leaving few behind.At the beginning of the film we see some unknown person climbing up into the house. This,of course, is the killer. The girls start to receive very disturbing phone calls(from inside the house!). This guys voice still gives me the creeps. The girls are not threatened at first. They think it is just some sicko pervert(sorority houses probably get a lot of calls like that!)but the calls get more violent and numerous. Eventually,the girls start to come up missing. When the dead body of a young girl is found in a nearby park, they get downright scarred.This movie has a great cast and a great sense of style. Olivia Hussey was a classic 70's beauty(she became popular after doing Romeo and Juliet). She add class to this movie. Margot Kidder is hilarious as the raunchy fowl mouthed Barbie. That fellatio joke is classic! This movie has some very funny moments but it does not distract from the horror. John Saxon, horror movie icon, plays the police detective. Kier Dullea(from 2001: a space odyssey)plays his rather dry self but it is adequate for the part.We never see the characters face in this movie. It is the atmosphere and the sense of unknown that makes this movie scary. This movie has no real gore yet it has some of the best death scenes in horror. Wait till you see how Margot Kidder dies, it is rather unique! The first girl that he kills he does so by suffocating her in a plastic bag. He then sticks her up in the attic. She is shown from time to time in the the attic on a rocking chair---creepy! This movie also has a creepy ending.This film is one of the greats of the horror genre yet it seems to be often overlooked. The problem might have been timing. It was made right after The Exorcist and and the same time as Texas Chainsaw. I think it got overshadowed by both of these films. No doubt it had a huge influence in the slasher sub-genre that would continue with Halloween and Friday the 13th. Bob Clark is a rather diverse director. He did movies from the teen sex comedy Porky's to the warm family film A Christmass Story. Black Christmass is to be remade in 2006 with Clark serving as executive producer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intensity to it's fullest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite scenes is when Jessica (The Gorgeous Olivia Hussey) finds some of her sorority sisters dead in a bed, and the killer's eye is peeping at her through the creak in the door. The whole chase scene down the steps afterward is edge of your seat material, some of the best I've ever experienced. Especially when you think Jessica is completely out of harms way, and the killers arm comes out of nowhere trying to grab her! I still freak at that scene! Enough could never be said at how amazingly eerie the phone calls are, even uneasy at times. The switching of voices sends chills down my back.Another great moment is Margot Kidder's death, while the Christmas caroling continues outside the house.There are a couple of plot holes that bugged me a bit...Okay, why on earth would Peter (Jessica's boyfriend) ever go looking for her in the basement of the sorority house at the end? You hear him yelling outside before he breaks out a window, but that doesn't make sense. Even if the doors were locked and he was yelling for Jessica, he already broke in once before (when Jessica and the others were at a search party for Clare), and it was never indicated that they weren't locked that time. Even so, it still makes no sense what so ever that he would look in the run down basement that looks like none of the girls have ever stepped a single foot in. I feel this entire scene was just made to make Peter look like the most ultimate Red Herring, but I think enough evidence was already pointing to him to totally steer the viewer away from the twist ending.Another thing that got to me was how they build John Saxon to act like a convincingly real cop, only to later make the whole police force to look like a bunch of backwoods Rosco P. Coltrane rejects. Early on Saxon is doing what a lot of cops do, asking questions that had already been answered. Like when he asked of the last time who and when someone had seen Clare, he said "Last time she was seen was this morning" when Jessica had already stated it was the night before. Subtle little bits like that won me over...What didn't was these cops knowing there is a second phone line in the house, and they didn't even think of that from the get go? Better yet, once they realized the calls WERE coming from the house, they never thought of checking the attic, or not even once looked for it? Come on! It was right above the girls rooms! Nevertheless, I did love the downbeat last five minutes of the movie. I guess many people felt cheated with the outcome, I kinda thought it was genius, I just didn't think the whole last ordeal with Peter and Jessica was needed at all for the ending to be so effective. Peter could've entered the house in a more believable way...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BLACK Christmas (1974)cast: Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder, John Saxon, Andrea Marton, Marian Waldman, Lynne Griffin.plot: A mysterious killer is hiding out in a sorority house making obscene phone calls while Jess (Olivia Hussey), Phyl (Andrea Martin), Barb (Margot Kidder), Clare (Lynne Griffin) and house mother Mrs. MacHenry (Marian Waldman) stay there for the weekend. But the phone calls aren't all, he begins to kill them off one by one.my thoughts: This began the fame of the killer p.o.v. shots, the heavy breathing and the holiday theme for slasher films. Somehow, HALLOWEEN got much more famous. This film had a group of likable characters that were developed enough for me to care about them, including John Saxon! I love that guy in ENTER THE DRAGON and the three NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET films he was in, and he's just as great here. He has an awesome presence.The killer is also very creepy. He/she would call and take on the voices of a man, woman and child and has conversations with himself which will get under your skin. He also likes to play around with certain bodies.****</fullReview>

It was made in 1974, and most people think John Carpenters Halloween started the whole slasher craze with Michael Myers, Jason, Freddy...But this is the one that inspired Halloween.I must say I really enjoyed this. Good acting, and original scared. I really liked the prank phone calls throughout the film, they were disturbing for a film that was made in 1974. So go out and see this movie because its a classic! The sexy Olivia Hussey, and Margot Kidder star in this masterpiece and they really carry this film as the two sorority babes. John Saxon plays the Police Officer and is dead on. The camera work is wonderful in this movie, and you can tell that John Carpenter clearly was inspired by this movie.

		<fullReview>I like it! I can already understand why people don't love it 'cause it's old for my generation (I'm 19, but I first saw the film in December 2001 when I was 16), but for me it's the movie that make a form to "Halloween" (1978), "When a stranger calls" (1979)... I think that Black Christmas is a little bit inspired by a strange slasher film of 1973, "Silent Night, Bloody Night". But if B.C. has a merit, is to be original for this time, it has a twist-end and it's the first Canadian slasher, with good and popular actors (Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder and John Saxon). In 2002, the sequel from this film was supposed to be realized (by Bob Clark again, I think, and with Olivia H. and John S. back in their original role) and I was waiting with big fun for this but it didn't come (like in 1975 when B. Clark decided to refused to make the sequel that was planned to be call "Halloween", with a strange neighbour plot to the John Carpenter's Halloween in 1978), with regret!</fullReview>

It definitely made me think about answering the phone.I actually cannot watch this flick in the dark; I did that the 1st time I saw it; even knowing that it's " only a movie" doesn't change it at all.Scary movies are my all time faves, and it certainly didn't disappoint.

		<shortDescription>A different kind of "Christmas Story" from Bob Clark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas, if nothing else, is a genuinely frightening film. Some have labeled it a "classic" but I'm not so sure I can go that far. True it clearly inspired numerous more successful films, but it's just "good" when taken on its own.Our story is simple enough. A deranged killer has snuck into the attic of a sorority house just as many of the girls are leaving for Christmas break. This guy is a real wacko. He begins calling the young women on a regular basis and threatening them in often obscure but VERY SPOOKY outbursts of jibberish. Then, he begins picking off those who remain behind one by one. The bulk of the latter half of the film centers around a police detective (John Saxon) trying to get to the bottom of everything and save the lives of the remaining girls. This film works mainly because of two reasons. First of all, this film has an atmosphere of gloom set over it like few I have ever seen before. Even though it's Xmas, and people should be having fun, the characters and the audience as well seem to know something terrible is going on around them. A prime example is the duality we are presented with when the group of carolers are singing to the beautiful Olivia Hussey while Margot Kidder is being stabbed to death in her bed at the same time. The second major factor that helps this film get its point across is the absolutely demented phone calls this killer makes. Wow! I have never heard anything more psychotic in any film that I can remember. These calls really make the case for just how screwed up this guy is. His multiple outbursts and different vocal tones will be ringing in your ears for a while after the film is over.The acting was decent, but I don't think anyone was particularly outstanding. The film had a noticeably restrictive budget, but Clark does what he can. This film sets quite a different tone than his later successes like Porky's and A Christmas Story. It makes me want to check out some of his other thrillers made early in his career.One thing about this film that also can give you the creeps is knowing that this sort of thing has happened in real life! Perhaps the most well-known incident like this was when Ted Bundy, one of America's most famous serial killers, dropped in for a visit to a sorority house at Florida State one evening. The results were very similar to what happened in this film. If you think about it, these houses full of young (and often attractive) women would seem a real beacon to these types of killers. Especially in a college town like the one I live in.Makes you wonder if or when this type of thing could happen again...7 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas is a dark, chilling film set in Canada. Its Christmas time and a mysterious evil person starts making spooky phone calls to a girls sorrority house and one by one the pours souls are put away, resulting in a brand new obscene phone call for each murder. This stars Olivia Hussey (Juliet from the 60's remake of Romeo and Juliet), Margot Kidder (Clark Kents best gal). Andrea Martin (SCTV) and John Saxson as, who else, a police detective. This was ten years before Saxson appeared in his most familiar role as Nancy's dad in A Nightmare on Elm Street. The sub-plot deals with Hussey's character, who is pregnant. She wants an abortion, but her boyfriend, Peter, objects to this. This subplot ties in to the obscene calls and keeps you guessing to the very end. The highlight is the Italian-style, dark and gloomy atmosphere and tone that Bob Clark has established. This amps up the spook factor and makes up for the lack of gore. This movie certainly paved the way for "Halloween" and "Scream" among many other horror films. Theres also a nice mix of humor, largely due to Margot Kidder and the dopey police sergeant, the same one from Porky's. Black Christmas combines many of the right elements in a good Horror movie with good scares, chilling music, and humor. If theres any downfall it would be that it is quite dated and this shows during a pivotal point in the movie where the Police put a tap on the obscene calls, but are only able to get a read by having Hussey's character keep the caller on the line for an extended length of time, but this does help build the drama and horror, however. Theres also a lot of profanity, for 1974, very strong language, but this adds to the realism of life in college sorrority. Highly Recommended for any horror film buff.</fullReview>

Hasn't anyone seen any of Argento's stuff? Geez. Much of the POV stuff had been done by him, including in Bird With the Crystal Plumage - which was done in 1970. Even Argento probably wasn't the first...almost everything new draws on something from the past. Don't get me wrong, Black Christmas and Halloween are both excellent movies, but even Carpenter said that Halloween was his Argento film, or somesuch.I guess what was new here (maybe?) was that no explanation was given for the killer's motivation, and that adds to the creepiness. This is something that Halloween took and ran with - so much so that Michael Myers has NO lines...I saw Halloween on TV in the early eighties when I was in elementary school - and I remember that part above all disturbing me: WHY did he kill? Why would anyone DO that? And why doesn't he TALK? :) I think when horror movies are wrapped up neatly it deflates any sort of hold they might have had otherwise ("if it wasn't for those darned kids"). And Black Christmas gives the viewer none of that sort of comfort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top ten horror films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally feel that this film is heads and shoulders more frightening than either Halloween/ Friday the 13th. This is a must rent if you can find it! I own the DVD and have lent it out uncountable times and have always met with a favorable response upon it's return. Knowing that this film predates Halloween, Friday the 13th and When a Stranger Calls you will see that it laid a great foundation upon which great horror films are still built upon today. The scariest aspect of this film is that there is no closure at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic from the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie as part of a double feature with the Exorcist back in 1975, It has stayed with me ever since. It's low-budget, dark, Canadian feel, makes it that much more creepy. It's well acted with a great cast, especially Margot Kidder. I'm sure it seems a bit dated by today's big budget standards, but that adds to the appeal of this classic. Although I have not seen this movie in quite a while now, many of the terrifying scenes linger in my head. I still cannot sing "Bye Baby Bunting" to my kids!The younger generation will not truly understand how horror movies of the seventies paved the way for some of today's classics. If you are a "true" horror fan, go rent the DVD! You won't be disappointed. Incredible ending!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scares me again and again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is simple--a crazy man hides in a mostly empty sorority house Christmas Eve. He begins to stalk and kill the remaining girls. This sounds like just another slasher thriller, but it's not. For starters, it came out 4 years before "Halloween" started the slasher craze and it's an intelligent, very scary movie--how many slashers can you say that about? The film was shot in Canada on a low-budget. With the exception of John Saxon, everybody was basically unknown (Margot Kidder made this before "Superman"). There's no sex, no nudity and very little blood and gore. Still, I've seen this movie at least 8 times and it scares me each and every time. All during the movie, even when the characters are inside, you hear the wind blowing through the soundtrack. It makes you feel the cold and chill the characters feel. Also there are the obscene phone calls the girls in the sorority house are getting--they're deeply disturbing and the frightening music playing during them makes them worse. A truly scary horror film--back in 1978 NBC cancelled a showing of the film--even edited they thought it was too disturbing to air! That should tell you something.SPOILERSThe most terrifying moments in the movie--the phone calls (especially when you hear the killer pleading to be stopped); when Olivia Hussey is grabbed by her hair; the opening murder and Margot Kidder's murder.Only complaint--the ending. It was original back in 1974 but it's an overused cliche now.A definite must-see. DON'T see it alone. A commercial bomb when released this has deservedly acquired a cult following.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior horror movie, but not as innovative or important as some say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read some reviewers say that Halloween was a rip-off of Black Christmas, I watched this movie and I'm relieved to say it's not really the case, since Halloween is the summum of horror movies for me. There is not a lot in common between the two movies that I can think of: madman killing people, heavy breathing/mysterious killer and nice POV camera work. I liked the POV in this movie, but it wasn't as effective as in Halloween because we see from the killer perspective before he commits a murder, therefore there was not really any suspense in those scenes, since we know where the killer is. In Halloween, the POV is used to create suspense when the killer is prowling, but it's not used before the murders, the fear of the unknown is what works best for me in those cases.Also, some people seem to think this movie invented POV in horror movies or the slasher flick. This is far from the truth, people should check some of Mario Bava's work or Peeping Tom. It was still an interesting stepping stone for the genre, but nothing innovative.Still, I found the first half chilling and interesting, but after a few murders, the movie became a little tedious because of the dumb script and predictable plot in the second half. Still, this movie gave me some chills in the first 30 minutes, I liked the bleak ending and the nice camera work and atmosphere, so it all adds up to a superior horror movie, well worth seeing but not quite a classic.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been promoted as the inspiration for "Halloween", and there are some similarities, but to tell you the truth, "Black Christmas" has always been so little known that I would be surprised if it influenced "Halloween". I think it's probably more a case of great minds thinking alike.After all, there are only so many ways to do the whole "psycho stalker" thing. That said...It's a pretty good movie. Not as good as "Halloween", but still admirable. On the plus side, it has beautiful cinematography, an eerie score, a palpably creepy atmosphere, freaking scary obscene phone calls, and good acting. On the minus side, the plot rarely makes much sense, the characters are so poorly developed that the wonderful acting was the only reason I cared about them, and the scares are too obligatory, even if they're so stylistically accomplished that they manage to be tense anyway. I also have to say that I don't think the film had as much emotional resonance as it could have.Basicly, this is a movie that could easily have been a bonafide classic, if only more attention had been paid to the script before shooting started. As it is, it's a near-miss, but still more than worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creeped me right out!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very simple tale, with the slaughter of a bunch of sorority girls during the Christmas period. This film is reminiscent of 'Halloween', so now we know where John Carpenter got most of his ideas (heavy breathing, POV shots) from.The main difference between this and 'Halloween' is the fact that the killer is never actually seen in full - the most we ever see of him is his eye peeping through a crack in the door. The death scenes are also far more inventive - the first girl to die is killed using the plastic surrounding the dry-cleaning in her wardrobe (Michael Myers isn't intelligent enough to do that), and her dead body is glimpsed throughout the rest of the film sitting in a rocking chair in the attic. The most disturbing aspect of this film, however, is the way the killer rants down the phone (from inside the house!!!! - top that Scream!)- they make no sense at all and serve to make him all the more creepy.The ending of this film is a total shocker, almost totally unexpected! I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it, but let's just say it'll have you checking all those dark corners in your house for things that go bump in the night!!!I saw 'Black Christmas' over the Christmas period in 2000, when UK TV station Channel 4 decided, in their infinite wisdom, that what the schedules really need at Christmas is a slasher movie. I'm glad they did show it, as I had never even heard of it before..... which is a bit surprising considering the cast of Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea (post-2001) and Margot Kidder (pre-Superman).If you can find this film in your local video store (probably under the title 'Silent Night, Evil Night'),go ahead and rent it - I guarantee you will not be disappointed. You'll be creeped right out, but you definitely won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is great to see that I am not the only one that was creeped out by this largely unseen film. I have been a horror film fan since i was 6 and had seen all the classic horror/slasher/gore films long before ever seeing Black Christmas. However, none of those films actually scared me like Black Christmas (or "Stranger in the House" as it was called in the U.S.). I first saw Black Christmas when I was in my second year of college and even though I watched it surrounded by friends and others in a brightly lite dorm, the weird, dark atmosphere of the film and the extremely bizarre phone calls made me uncomfortable and still do when I think about it years later. The scenes of the killer wandering around the attic making strange noises and playing with the body of the first victim also rank as the most frightening moments in my own film experience. Some of the comments here compare it to John Carpenter's Halloween but in my opinion Black Christmas is a much more effective and scary film. If you are looking for a disturbing and frightening film, you should seek out this forgotten classic and watch it alone late at night. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the very first of it's kind in more than one aspect: 1) It is basically the first real slasher film. 2) It is the first movie to really employ the phone terror tactic. 3) It is the first movie to show the film through the killer's eyesight. This are 3 very big firsts, because they have shaped the horror genre very drastically. So this is like a monument to the whole genre of horror. Is it worthy of this title? Yes, it was a very daring, slick movie that was overlooked when it came out, but it has now quickly become a classic. People are finally recognizing it for what it was. It isn't fair to compare this movie to Halloween. Halloween had a much bigger budget, and more polished shooting. The guys that made Black Christmas didn't have very much to work with, but they still pulled something tremendous off. The gore is basically non-existant in this film, but there is a fair amount of suspense to it which is a plus to most people. Now what really makes this movie shine is the atmosphere, it is really straight to the point and very dark. The movie begins immediately, there is no beating around the bush! And the movie also ends very abruptly leaving you in question at times. That is another plus. Basically, all appreciators of the slasher genre should check this movie out, if they haven't done so already. I don't know if others will enjoy this though, as it doesn't have much else to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Run of the mill slasher flick featuring the classic killer's P.O.V. which was used so effectively in Peeping Tom (1960) and imitated many times since. Boring, predictable and badly acted for the most part. Even the murders suffer from a lack of a novel approach. I did like the sicko's voice during the obscene phone calls and the scenes in the attic were creepy enough. Had to watch the ending a few times cause I thought I'd missed something. Turns out I didn't. It's just bungled and falls rather flat. Perhaps this film was considered innovative at the time of its 1974 release, but it certainly hasn't aged well. Worth checking out if you're a true fan of the genre, but there's nothing here you haven't seen before. A far cry from what I consider Bob Clark's best horror film, Deathdream, a.k.a. Dead Of Night, a.k.a. The Night Andy Came Home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it is fascinating that 'Black Christmas' very clearly precedes the embodiment of the slasher genre (which began officially with 'Halloween' in 1978) yet so-called film critics often fail to acknowledge this fact. Although I did not find the movie to be 100% satisfying, it was certainly an original piece of work at the time it was released and therefore deserves to be credited with being a major influence on such horror classics as 'Halloween', 'When a Stranger Calls' and 'Scream' among many others. In relation to the film itself, on the positive side it was atmospheric, undeniably creepy (the telephone calls are probably the most frightening ever filmed)and was free of the usual sex and extreme gore which often spoils such pictures. The abortion angle was also an intriguing and surprisingly adult issue to embrace in a movie of this type. In addition, it was endowed with a strong cast, making it interesting to see at least four reasonably well known actors appearing in what amounts to a fairly low budget shocker. Olivia Hussey seems an unlikely actress to appear in a film of this kind given some of her other roles, but her off-beat casting works very well. Margot Kidder made a star making impression to follow her effective performance in Brian De Palma's 'Sisters'(1973)and John Saxon got to play the police man role which he seemed to then enjoy repeating in other subsequent horror outings (i.e; 'Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Blood Beach' etc). However, I did not think that Keir Dullea was entirely well cast in the role of the boyfriend. He is certainly a talented actor with a gift for playing intense and even unbalanced parts but he seemed wasted here. He also appeared too old for the 20-something character he was representing. (I believe Mr Dullea was around 38 years of age when the movie was made). Other criticisms are that the film was a mite too slowly paced, and it was also highly improbable, especially in that the killer remained undiscovered for so long. Finally, I found the end to be a silly disappointment and rather succeeded in diminishing the overall effect of the film by its lack of any adequate explanation/conclusion to events. (However,to be fair,this is true of many horror films). Generally speaking, 'Black Christmas' is a reasonably effective shocker of its kind which will certainly appeal to fright fans (like me)and has deserved more attention over the years for being such an inspiration to future horror classic horror (although I doubt if anti-horror film purists would agree with this credit).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on television, at night, alone, when I was about 12, and it was one of the scariest experiences I ever had watching a movie. Catching up with it again now as an adult, it still sends shivers through me - even if I know what to expect.Before Bob Clark began wasting his time with low-brow comedies he fashioned several low budget horror films, of which this is the best and most adult. His skill in putting the screws to the audience's nerves is aided &amp; abetted by a soundtrack that itself promotes unease, rich photography, and a solid cast. While the story of a sorority house plagued by an unseen killer has been done to death (no pun intended), Clark did it years before the stalker film cycle of the late 70's / early 80's, and with much more talent than 99% of them. The final 15 minutes are out-and-out terrifying, and the final scene, while open to debate - still haunts as a macabre joke.The story? It's Christmas, of course. A sorority house is tormented by bizarre, schizophrenic obscene calls. Soon, people begin to disappear. Who is responsible? Watch it. Just keep the lights on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was only 9 when I first watched to this wonderful, unforgettable, mysterious picture and I felt in LOVE with it. The second time, I got it on a secondary channel, here in Italy, but it was 4:00 a.m. so my father had to throw me out of my bed in order to watch to it again after a long, desperate wait. Now I'm grown up but I never get tired to talk about it. During my short life, I have watched to a lot of slasher and thriller movies but none of them could compete with this. You can't say you really know this genre if you haven't seen this movie. There are a lot of gimmicks and emblems that you can get about it: the attempts to trace the source of the phone calls, the phone calls themselves, Jesse's slowly climb up the stairs with the fireplace pocket in her hands, her lonely fight and run from the killer through the empty, old house towards the basement, the killer's shapes and his frightening and staring EYE behind the door, his hide-and-seek in the attic and his hysterical personality. All this means a great proof in the history of the Cinema. The cast is all perfect, the colours are brilliantly composed and I have a special devotion to Mr. CLARK, the director, simply a genius. My compliments to his courage facing problems like abortion and violence between guys, on Campus. All my recognitions to the incomparable and beautiful Hussey's performance. Thanks to this movie, you can now appreciate films like " Hallowen", " When A Stranger Calls"," Friday the 13th", "Scream"... All these are ITS sons. That's a pity because I haven't got anymore room to type in , otherwise I could chat about this movie over and over again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Black Christmas tonight finally, after years &amp; years of being a horror movie fan. I've heard so much about it. A lot of good things. I'm also one of the biggest fans of John Carpenters Halloween. It's not only my favourite horror movie of all-time, but my favourite movie of all-time period.I respect this film. It was neat. A lot of scenes I noticed were done in Halloween. It was well made. However, it wasn't scary. It didn't have major fear factors in there. One of the biggest things a slasher/horror movie needs is the killer to be intimidating or creepy.Also, a great score would've been fantastic. Unfortunately, it was missing good music as well in my opinion.This movie isn't frightening in the least bit. I got a few chills in the last 30 seconds of the film, but that's it. I don't know what all the hype is about. I respect what it has done for slasher movies, but if you can't go back, watch the film and truly be creeped out after decades, then its not a classic.This movie isn't a classic. Rather a stepping stone for art work such as John Carpenters Halloween. I would never compare Halloween to this movie. Never has a slasher/horror movie been done so well as Carpenter &amp; Hill created Michael Myers in 1978.I could honestly say Tobe Hoopers Texas Chainsaw Massacre scares the living hell out of me until this day. Same goes for Exorcist. Halloween, not so much anymore considering i've lived with it since I was a child.6/10 Overall - See it for a history lesson on how American slasher films came to be.</fullReview>

It has a mysterious killer, a big house to work with, faster paced and better characterization. I felt like a kid hiding under the covers during some of the brutal scenes. It could be very creepy like when the killer would taunt them or talk about sexual content that I suspect he was performing on the bodies.The music even became an entity that reached a pitch at climatic scenes resulting in nearly turning my hair white.I can't say there was ever a dull moment. I watched it dozens of times and have never been bored by it. It always has the characters involved in parties or on a hunt and noting around. I nearly suffered whiplash.Black Christmas may be ignored by critics at its release, but now has the cult following it deserved.Special mentions to Marget Kidder who was a delight and my favorite character. Olivia before her Romeo and Juliet days and John Saxon we all know from elm street. Ask for black Christmas this December. It'll be the best present you ever got.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong Number?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas, also known as Silent Night, is a Psychological Slasher Horror movie and considered to be one of the earliest Slasher films in general. It's based on a urban legend about a teenage girl babysitting children who receives telephone calls from a man who continually asks her to "check the children". If that doesn't sound like the perfect Christmas flick for the entire family, then I don't know. The actresses are both gorgeous and talented, but what I loved most about this movie is that unsettling voice that you keep hearing through the phone. It's genuinely disturbing and I didn't even understand everything he mumbled. The contrast between the Christmas/ holiday spirit with the dark atmosphere works perfectly. The movie isn't really that graphic but again, that voice will possibly haunt you for a while. Another interesting element is that we look through the killers perspective, which allowed to killer to keep his identity secret from the audience. The Slasher genre may have become a bit repetitive but don't let that stop you from watching this classic. Now I'd love to write some more but I have some calls to make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This weeks entry is something special. For starters it is directed by none other than the genius behind one of the most beloved Christmas classics in the history of Christmas classics, A Christmas Story (1983). Yes, the man himself, Mr. Bob Clark. I bet you're thinking to yourself, "Self, I bet the movie this week is going to be a sweet, fun filled romp that will transport me back to when Christmas was chock full of magic and wonder." Well, you'd be wrong. Instead, The Mock Films Blog is proud to present the one, the only (unless you include the lack luster remake from 2006) Black Christmas (1974).Why, you may ask, did I choose a horror film for this joyous holiday season? Well, honestly, if we can call Die Hard (1988) a Christmas movie then we can do the same for this one. (Merry Christmas. On with the blog.) The film revolves around a group of happy-go-drinky sorority sisters getting ready for Christmas break. Little do the naive ladies know, someone other than Santa will be paying them a visit this year.What makes this film so great is that it's as funny as it is scary. Clark puts his signature subtle humor that we saw in A Christmas Story and applies it to this much earlier work. Margot Kidder as the loose cannon is really amusing, along with the booze hound house mother played by Marian Waldman. But for all of its goofiness, the scares are just as strong. From the creepy POV of the killer wandering through the house unnoticed, the disturbingly graphic prank calls made to the sisters, to the solid gore effects,this is a nasty little jump scare flick. Although, it might be a rough watch for those who are bummed out easily during the holidays (go watch A Christmas Story marathon. Bob Clark thought of you too).?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sorority house is terrorized by obscene phone calls, while one by one the girls are stalked from within the house.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the night before Christmas Eve at a campus sorority house when the phone rings. The muffled breaths of the caller can be heard on the other end. Soon, heavy breathing turns into lascivious outbursts, cries that egg on Barb (Margot Kidder) while unsettling the rest. Soon, nobody can find Clare (Lynne Griffin), which leads her father (James Edmond) to contact the police, lead by Lt. Fuller (John Saxon). With the disturbing calls continuing into Christmas Eve, and Jess' (Olivia Hussey) boyfriend upset, it soon becomes evident that there's more to the night than just carol's and Christmas lights.When an unsuspecting world received Black Christmas, the term and sub-genre slasher wouldn't insert itself into the mainstream canon for another 4 years. Pre-dating John Carpenter's Halloween, the aforementioned cannonball to the eyes of American cinema, our film aptly embraces the first person perspective alarmingly introduced with such films as Peeping Tom and Psycho. While the former, Michael Powell's compellingly voyeuristic tale, ultimately ushered in the perspective that would end up widely used in the genre, it wasn't until Bob Clark's holiday slasher that we would see its use popularized in film.What Black Christmas does exceptionally well is assert an uncomfortable gaze over its viewer, one that helps peel backs its grainy, exploitative layer with a razor sharp masculine fixation on the female body. We witness the sorority house from afar, only getting closer as our peeping tom does. Even when we're invited in before he climbs through an upstairs window, it's always through the perceived eyes of our voyeur. The masculine gaze controls much of our perception as he slowly preys on the sorority sisters, a light cascading across a peering eye. When Claire is strangled, her body is propped up by a window with her eyes peering out and mouth agape, echoing the sexually deranged moans of our caller.It's these perverse and sexually driven calls that push our film forward, filling every frame with tension on what we already know. Bob Clark frames the horror with staircases, doorframes and windows, utilizing these as the eyes of our killer. While we don't know who it is, we know where he is; yet this understanding only adds increased value to the terror that presses down on us. It's a pressure that weighs so heavy it rests in our stomach, a feeling Jess carries with her as she tells her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea) of her pregnancy and impending abortion. When he tells her what she can and cannot do with her own pregnancy, he stares at her with the same fixation as our killer.Writer Roy Moore plays between the killings and a male-dominated state of mind with a juxtaposition that reverberates even more so today. Peter tells Jess that she can't kill the baby, while she never implies that it's a baby nor uses the word kills. We then shift back to the sorority house, a home that is devoid of male governance, save for the looming eyes of our intruder. The dominating male gaze echoes the dominating male voice that pushes Jess away, further into our place of murder. These transitions spur on the ominous dread that hangs in the air as each kill unfolds, our now final girl clinging to a hope we know doesn't exist.The world that Bob Clark and Roy Moore bring to life is reminiscent of its time, yet mirrors those that we live in today. Its morally strong lead, and similarly dueling views, both literally and symbolically, helped usher in the sub-genre that films like Silent Night, Deadly Night and Night of the Demons would inevitably destroy in the years to come. Black Christmas works as a powerfully affecting, unsettling piece of pre-slasher filmmaking that establishes itself as an important piece in horror cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas (1974): Dir: Bob Clark / Cast: Olivia Hussey, Kier Dullea, Margot Kidder, John Saxon, Marian Waldman: Canadian slasher where evil makes its presence within a time of year known for being joyous. Billy is never seen but his childish screeching voice can be heard through prank calls to the girls in the fraternity house. One victim is suffocated through clear plastic and left rocking in a chair in the attic while her father arrives searching for her. Bob Clark previously directed Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things but here he is backed with chilling atmosphere and better writing. Olivia Hussey is the central focus and Kier Dullea plays her overbearing boyfriend. She is pregnant but decides on having an abortion. Dullea is a failing and frustrated pianist who is against Hussey having an abortion. Dullea is also chief suspect for the murders as well. Other personalities emerge including the lovely Margot Kidder in a drunken spree spewing comedic disrespect to all who will listen. Her murder scene amongst swan and unicorn ornaments is a highlighted stylish scenes. John Saxon plays the police chief whose staff provide comic moments. Marian Waldman also provides comic moments as the house mom at the fraternity house. She is crass and seems to have liquor stashed everywhere. Pointless heartbreak that no one need to live through but viewers will enjoy experiencing. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked atmospheric horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>25 Days Of Christmas Cheer: Day 13Before John Carpenter's Halloween, there was Black Christmas, and no it's not a Tyler Perry holiday special. It's a slick little slasher set in a 1970's sorority house during Christmas break, when many of the girls have gone home. Suddenly mysterious phone calls start to plague the ones still there, and one by one a murderous, unseen prowler starts to murder them. The phone calls themselves aren't overly threatening, but instead sound like the nonsensical babbling of someone who is a couple reindeer short of a sleigh, making them all the scarier. I remember watching this years ago and being far more creeped out at the phone calls rather than the actual murders. That is a perfect example of using atmosphere to get under your audience's skin rather than straight up gore, and a testament to the fright films of the 70's and 80's, which really seemed to have all the atmosphere vs. gore dials in the right positions. This positively drips with tension and ambiance. The silences in between screams are almost deafening in their vacuous anticipation of terror to come, and strange as it sounds, there's actually a nice Christmas-y feeling in places where the fear hasn't yet struck, despite it being a horror movie. Olivia Hussey plays Jess, the main target of the killer with appropriate wide eyed intensity, Margot Kidder is briefly seen as the house mother, and horror regular John Saxon shows up as a suspicious Police Chief as well. I'd say this one achieves a state of suspense and atmosphere that can step up to the same plate as Halloween any day, it's just a little overlooked I suppose. The house they are in is the perfect setting, a sprawling Yuletide manor of creaky hallways, desolated basements, dark, dingy attic space and an uneasy thrum of awaiting gloom that gives the words Silent Night a new meaning. The poor girls just never know when a shrill telephone ring will slice through the eerie corridors, forcing them to answer it and hear an unnerving voice warble out "It's me, Billy" on the other end. PS: avoid the remake at all costs. It takes everything that was creepy and restrained about this classic and turns it into a disgusting nightmare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely influential slasher/horror is nearly a match for Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic exercise in subtlety, this film prefers to leave the horror to the imagination rather than splattering it graphically across our screens. And it benefits as a result of this. In fact, the film has the (dubious) distinction of being the first 'proper' slasher film, influencing many others that were to come later, including the classic HALLOWEEN.The director, Bob Clark, was no stranger to horror films, having directed CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS. With Black Christmas, he popularised many of the clichés we are used to seeing in horror films today, such as the obscene telephone calls. Of course, when this film was made these ideas were still fresh, and not clichés at all. There's also the POV shot from the killer in the opening scene, which was used again to great success in HALLOWEEN. Due to the success of the latter, this film remains neglected in the annals of horror, and is not credited with the creation of the numerous clichés which slasher horrors of the 1980s contained.One big advantage this film has over the many other slasher films around is the realism and atmosphere. For instance, the characters in the film are totally realistic, and all have traits which make them interesting. Margot Kidder is fine as the foul-mouthed alcoholic and Olivia Hussey is excellent as the main heroine. Obviously parallels are to be drawn between her character and Jamie Lee Curtis' character in HALLOWEEN, but I would go so far to say that Hussey creates a more believable person in this film, someone to really empathise with. John Saxon is on hand once again to play a policeman (what else?) and personally I find him totally capable in the role as well - he offers a hard, but kind presence, someone who you can turn to for help, which is exactly what a policeman should be.There's also a little bit of comedy, revolving around a slow policeman at the station. The killer's manic telephone calls are totally disturbing and offer a contrast to the silent menace of Michael Myers. This killer is insane! With lots of atmospheric scenes and an unsettling ending guaranteed to stay with you long after the film has finished playing, this is really one of the best slasher films there is, a film strong enough on chills to cope without the welter of blood and gore and inventive deaths we are used to seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christmas film that's full of surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're getting tired of re-runs that show the same Christmas films every Holiday season and you happen to also enjoy horror films, then I would strongly recommend that you take the time to watch Black Christmas this year. Because it will be worth every minute of your time.Black Christmas is a Canadian horror film and the second that I've ever had the pleasure to view. The first being The Changeling, which has a very similar tense and eerie atmosphere to it and I think would compliment Black Christmas very well if they were put in a double feature together. However, the latter film definitely appeals more to a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour so it's the funnier of the two. The jokes are really well done and do a marvellous job of lightening up the mood at all of the appropriate moments. But that's not to say that the film's more unsettling scenes aren't superb either. They're masterfully well done, invoking mystery and suspense at every twist of the plot. John Carpenter was inspired to make his slasher classic Halloween after viewing it and you'll definitely see why. The cinematography is fantastic. I am not sure if it was the first film to employ the use of a camera that can strap onto an actor's head but it's used very well in the opening scene of Black Christmas. The acting from Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, John Saxon and the rest of the supporting cast leave nothing to be desired. Everyone is clever and convincing as their characters and felt so authentic, it only made me feel more shocked when one of them would get killed off. I wish I could go into detail about the movie's more brilliant aspects, but it's far better than you go into this film knowing as little about it as possible. This film will keep you guessing right until the very end. It plays you like a fiddle the moment you press play but you'll enjoy every moment of it. Black Christmas is thrilling, terrifying and darkly funny. A very different twist on your typical Christmas film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this short because I'd rather not spend much time dwelling on this movie. I found this movie to be highly overrated, boring and grossly irritating. It's comical to say this gave birth to the slasher genre and for movies like Halloween and Friday the 13th owe their existence to this dull flick. The acting was as putrid as the direction of the film. The only redeeming part of the movie was John Saxon and that's solely due to him being in Nightmare on Elm St. People give the remake a hard time, but it's much more entertaining than this dumpster fire of a movie. I'd rather watch a marathon of Lifetime movies before ever being subjected to this pile of garbage again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior to Carpenter's Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oddly enough, Halloween gets most of the credit for defining the slasher genre. But, Halloween offers nothing new and could have very well just been a sequel to Bob Clark's Black Christmas.Black Christmas is the most overlooked horror films of all time, and easily stands as one of the best. Most of the things that people praise Halloween for have already been done in Black Christmas. With that said, I do not believe originality is as critical as many people claim. But, Clark executes these elements better than carpenter does...and did so several years earlier.Halloween is about what? An escaped mental patient who returns to his childhood home where he murdered his family decades earlier. This is the exact premise of Black Christmas. Substitute "sorority girls" with "babysitters" and change "Christmas" to "Halloween" and wa-lah!The heavy breathing of Michael Myers and killer POV...yup, in Black Christmas. My intention is not to knock Halloween, but merely to point out that Bob Clark does not get the proper recognition in revolutionizing the slasher genre.The defining creepy image in Black Christmas is the shot of the suffocated girl in the attic on a rocking chair, positioned to be looking outside the window. The ultimate creep out scene in Halloween is when Michael Myers cocks his head ever so slightly after killing Bob. Both scenes give us the whole "what is going through the killer's mind?"Both are great films, but Black Christmas is under-praised, while Halloween is overpraised.

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas (1974) 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas is ultimately one of the most under-appreciated horror films in the horror genre and really a pioneer movie for the slasher genre. The beginning of the film is terrific since it really takes its time setting up characters and the unseen psycho, inside the sorority house, almost like a chess match. Bob Clark did a fantastic job with the casting and character development. Oliva Hussey and Margot Kidder was what steered this film forward with their fine performance and natural attractiveness. John Saxon, who most know from A Nightmare on Elm Street, had a major role and was also top-notch. Perhaps my favorite part of the movies though is the psycho phone calls that the sisters get. Many films have tried to duplicate the phone calls, but none have been able to match the insanity and effectiveness that Black Christmas achieved. I could rave forever about Black Christmas, even the ending, which many people may not have liked; I thought it was definitely a good way to end an incredible horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I know(!); Something dirty, ain't it?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, a second viewing of a slasher classic, or at least a father to the slasher genre, though not the only one; 'Psycho' (1960), 'The girl who knew too much' (1963), 'Reazione a catena' (1971) and maybe even the elusive 'Delitto al luna park' (1952), if one is willing to interconnect the giallo with the slasher - they all amount to one big happy bloody (this one is relatively not so bloody, by the way) family to me. This one I remember as being particularly atmospheric and creepy, but I never rated it higher than 7 out of 10.After having seen it again just the other night, a theory entered my mind: the piano player did it after all! I have several observations to substantiate this, but first, a few things which director Bob Clarke has stated (if I may believe the - very interesting! - list of trivia here on IMDb): 1. 'Clark (-) insisted that the ending be ambiguous', which means Clark máy have had a certain explanation in mind. 2. 'Clark considered it to be more of a psychological horror film than a slasher film', which will fall exactly in line with my theory. 3. '...The ending of the film forces people to think independently' Again, not a debunking, nor a confirmation, so...So, Peter did it, I'm thinking now. Why? The ending (in ?the attic', which could be metaphorically observed as 'the mind', the 'top floor') is a way to mess with the viewer and offers an insight to the schizophrenic mind. Next, all the times and places when and where Peter could be at the times of the calls and the murders pan out. In other words, he has NO alibi(s)! Then there are the strange coincidences. Peter shows up behind Jess just after she received a call and the reason he wouldn't kill her right then and there, is because he may still hope for her to choose to have their baby. This 'baby' (/abortion) motif that haunts Peter is also is very important to my theory, as the caller's voices refer to it many times - 'baby Agnes'... When he is finally convinced Jess will not have the baby and she tries to escape, he makes his final move. Which brings us all to the basement (scene). How coincidental would it be that Peter would just show up there, let alone that he knows Jess is there?In terms of general logics it is very strange that the whole house wasn't searched when Clare went missing, when some even feared she might have hurt herself. I mean, it is just common sense then, to check the attic and the basement (if not by the police, then certainly by her roommates and friends) - another little sign? I'm really unsure about that part. All in all, my theory does agree with Clark's statement that this is a psychological horror; Peter is both the brilliant and savvy artist, ánd the demented and traumatized killer - a schizophrenic if I'm not mistaken.Perhaps the film should be considered a hermetic, atmospheric piece of modern art, disguised as a slasher (oops, that term wasn't even invented yet in 1974!) with comedic elements - ?I know(!); something dirty, ain't it?" Personally, I didn't know whether to love or hate those 'funny parts' (the silly cop, the drunk lady of the house), but there's always next time...In any case, it is a most artful thriller of the eeriest kind, I was way off with my first rating; 9 out of 10 this time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Other movies have borrowed heavily from this holiday horror film, but there's a reason for that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's ironic in a way. "Black Christmas" predates pretty much every single slasher horror film (including the one I consider the first in the genre, "Halloween") but you can see so many elements in this film that have been borrowed or distilled into familiar horror tropes that at first, it will seem kind of routine. For this reason, you might be wondering what the big deal is about if you're just a casual movie viewer. There's a lot more to it than just an ancient ancestor of your "Friday the 13th" and your "Prom Night" though. It goes without saying that if you're a true fan of horror cinema, this is a must-see. The plot, as you might expect happens on Christmas Eve/Day. It follows a group of sorority sisters who are stalked and murdered by an unknown killer hiding in the attic of their sorority house. Sounds basic? In a way it is, but it's the details that make this movie stand out.As a fan of horror movies, I have a great deal of admiration for this film. I enjoy seeing the beginnings of the horror genre. The cast of characters gradually being reduced in numbers as the movie comes along, the building tension, "the final girl", the various kills and the escalating terror as the sorority sisters slowly realize that there is something very wrong happening. It's like looking at the skeleton of an ancestor to Tyrannosaurus Rex and looking at what bones are going to gradually turn into which ones and what traits were deemed unnecessary so they were dropped until the creature in front of you became this legendary killing machine. From a fan of horror films, this historical aspect ranks about 3rd on my list of "favourite things about Black Christmas". I'll get to #1 in a bit, but my #2 isn't the familiar aspects. It's the sort of precursors to some of the familiar tropes in slasher films that are quite different in their primeval state. For example, the main character in the film isn't very clear at first. Are we going to be following the killer? Is it going to be Margot Kidder's character, the sarcastic, drunken girl who appears to kick-start the plot? Usually the protagonist of the film is "the virgin", so maybe it will be Claire (Lynne Griffin), who leaves the party early when she is offended by Barb's lewd remarks? Maybe it's Jess (Olivia Hussey), the recipient of the obscene phone call that is our first clue as to who the killer might be? Just as there are some points in the film where your familiarity with slasher films will help you deduce some developments, the fact that this movie doesn't adhere to many of the clichés (because it predates them) makes it often unpredictable and unconventional as far as films of the genre go. You'll be surprised to learn, for example, that the killer in this film does not have a signature weapon, that we don't really learn a lot about who he is and that there's really not much blood in the film. Just when you think you've got this movie figured out, it throws you for a loop, and I like not knowing where a plot is going to go.You're probably wondering what the main appeal, my favourite thing about this movie is. Well, it's the fact that the film is genuinely frightening. There's a very naturalistic look about the film that brings home the terror. The movie doesn't begin with a fresh face going to college for the first time and being introduced to a slew of characters, some of which act funny from the start to indicate they might be the killer later. It starts at Christmas time. All of these characters know each other, they're all busy doing their own thing, and it's like you're coming in uninvited to peep in on the action (in a way that's similar to the killer). When we hear the phone ring and learn that it's a strange man making lewd phone calls, and that he's been doing this for a while, it's not really a grandiose shock to the characters, they've heard it before and yeah, it's creepy, but it's not a big deal. It really feels like these people have a life outside of the events of this movie. We hear several off-hand remarks of other crimes that have happened around the campus, and we have no way of knowing if they're connected to this plot at all. This helps make the identity of the killer even more mysterious. Has he been murdering people for a long time and he's just now coming into contact with these sorority sisters? Is this the first night and the other events are just coincidences in the same way that you have coincidences all the time in real life? A lot of it can only be guessed because like the characters in the movie, you don't really get big bits of exposition explaining the who, the what and the why of this plot. This lingering uncertainty as to what exactly is happening, and why, makes the conclusion of the film incredibly intense and unsettling. There are images of the killer that spook me every time I see them."Black Christmas" is a movie that does suffer because it has been imitated so much, but there's a reason it hasn't been forgotten. It has some really genuinely frightening scenes, a lot of tension and also several humorous scenes to throw you off. I really like the comedic moments because just like in real life, when you get genuinely scared you do manage to find little nuggets of humour to try and steel yourself. You have probably heard some things about this film and wondered what the big deal was about, but watch it again, really watch it and I think you'll agree that it really is something special.

		<fullReview>Sorority sisters are terrorized by obscene phone calls in their sorority house at Christmas. Eventually, there is a murder. "Black Christmas" is a whodunit but with a twist ending that I find mildly dissatisfying.Much of the plot consists of routine chitchat and the comings and goings of the girls. So viewers will need to find one or more characters entertaining in some way to maintain interest in the plot. The elderly house mom who likes to sneak a drink from a cleverly hidden bottle provides comic relief. What these people don't know, but we viewers do, is that the killer is somewhere inside the large multistory house, watching and stalking them.Many scenes take place at night, and most are dimly lit, with spooky side lighting. The usual Christmas carols, peaceful and reassuring, are punctuated by the discordant sounds of piano strings that signal that the killer is nearby and/or active in some way. Adding to the tension and terror are sound effects, including the whistling of wind through the trees, footsteps of the killer, and his hesitant breathing. Several scenes are photographed from the killer's POV. Casting and acting are generally acceptable.The subplot about the outdoor search party seemed distracting and irrelevant to me; it could have been left out. Scenes at the police station also detract from the appropriately claustrophobic atmosphere of the sorority house.Despite an unsatisfying ending, the excellent color photography, music, and sound effects throughout the plot magnify suspense and mystery. Which renders "Black Christmas" a must-see for Horror genre viewers. And the film inaugurates a script formula that was so successful that it has been copied many times by other movies since this film first appeared some forty years ago, to render it a must-see for film historians.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I realize that I am late to the party on this one. After watching the Universally hated Remake of the film (Which all in all was a decent remake, Way better than The Halloween, and other remakes for sure). I had never seen this film until late last year when I was on ebay looking for good scary movies. This was #1 on my bucket list. I won the auction. And When I sat down and watched the film for the first time, I was astonished. On how well directed this film was. I could see the aspects of where John Carpenter's Halloween had taken it from this. The way you didn't know what this man was doing or why. Just made it ten times creepier. From beginning to finish I was amazed. It starts off on Christmas Eve, you go into a first-Person view of the Killer as he approaches the house. He then begins to climb in. Just the way his hands are climbing up the fence was chilling. The film is a Masterpiece. Unfortunately for Bob's other work. Yeah not so Well. (Porky's, Baby Geniuses 1 &amp; 2 and so Forth.) The Phone calls at which are made throughout the film get creepier and Creepier as the film progresses. The kills are solid and this is one I could watch every year. And let me not forget the Attic scenes in the film. I had chills. An All around great movie. A must see for Horror Movie Lovers.</fullReview>

However, I love slasher films in general and Black Christmas sadly was remade in 2006, leaving this nostalgic original thrill-ride behind in the dust. What people forget often is that this one is way better in terms of characters, plot and soundtrack. I will say that the phone call they got in the first few minutes was incredibly disgusting and seemed over-the-top even for a horror film, but aside from that, this is one slasher you won't want to pass up!

The girls get the police involved, but there isn't much they can do. Soon enough the girls get killed off one by one. The film isn't gory, but it does have some pretty creative kills. There's an overwhelming sense of dread and a lot of suspenseful sequences throughout the movie, the characters are likable and realistic, especially the survivor of the film, who never actually fights the killer, but is still a very tough girl.

		<fullReview>Random thoughts about this chilling classic: Several years before John Carpenter's wildly overrated Halloween, there was Bob Clark's Black Christmas, quite possibly the best, most underrated horror/ thriller ever produced. Presumably, Carpenter shares this adoration, as Halloween is, at times, a scene-for-scene ripoff.Sweet girl Claire is the first one to be killed in a surprisingly brutal burst of violence by a psycho killer stalking a sorority house at Christmastime. Her dead body, with a plastic coat bag wrapped over her head, is a chilling sight (one which was, unfortunately, revealed on the front cover of the original video box!) Her father then shows up to search for her, around the same time another girl is attacked in the park, and ..... a string of obscene, threatening phone calls plague the missing girl's sorority house.Margot Kidder's character amusingly gives the psycho caller a tongue lashing of his own, before he very calmly states, "I'm going to kill you," and softly hangs up the phone. Chilling and intentionally humorous, not an easy combination to pull off. Indeed, the film's first two thirds are also played largely for intentional humour, to give the audience a chance to breathe in between acts of violence by the unseen killer - which only make his violent outbursts even more shocking.Peter's right eye brightly lit by a lamp, while the rest of his face is largely darkened in shadow, as Jess tells him she's pregnant; then later, we see the killer's left eye brightly lit twice, while the rest of him is in shadows. Silhouette of killer's hair looks similar to Peter, but his clothing is different. Was that director Bob Clark showing us the killer, or providing us with a red herring? And why did Peter go around at the back of the house, and smash his way through the basement window to get to Jess, immediately after the killer was chasing her? Good timing on his part, or incredibly poor timing? One of my favourite scenes has John Saxon's Lt. Fuller walking into a pitch black piano room, silhouetted in the doorway, switching the lights on to see Peter's piano, smashed to bits. Fuller walks toward it in complete silence, and we can see the gears turning over in his mind as he imagines the possibilities of Peter being a violent killer.Strikingly beautiful photography in the wintry setting, and inside the sorority house, is another major asset.Hauntingly beautiful, minimalist music score (which, according to composer Carl Zittrer, was accomplished by lightly strumming wooden forks over piano wire) added to its already odd atmosphere, without distracting from it.I cannot think of anything I would change about this film, nor can I think of any other movie with so many unanswered questions, yet which still contains such a satisfying ending- an ending which still sends a chill down my spine. As we recap the scenes of the crimes, the telephone starts to ring and continues endlessly in the silent night.That ending recap, incidentally, was copied almost identically four years later by John Carpenter in Halloween. A vastly inferior film, in my opinion.</fullReview>

Filmed in 1974 in Canada Black Christmas is a combination of seasonal movies and horror, more precisely one of the first films of the 'slash' sub-genre.Film director Bob Clark is author and this is one of the first in a career that will still includes some successes of the genre, and even a second film (A Christmas Story) with the theme of Christmas. Clark demonstrates that by 1974 he already mastered many of the secrets of the trade and assimilated the lessons of the masters of the previous generations and especially Hitchcock. The film takes place in one of those American sorority houses. Thrill is induced at the beginning by mysterious and threatening phone calls, because shortly afterward the home tenants begin to disappear one by one, and the bodies to accumulate. I will not tell more so that I do not take away the pleasure of watching for those who still are interested to see the film.'Black Christmas' deserves to be viewed primarily by enthusiasts of the genre, but not only them. I can not say it is a film that time has not made &#x200b;&#x200b;its mark , but interestingly good as its parts are now more visible. At launch it was almost 'destroyed' by some critics, for example that of New York Times. Although some of the critic's objections are deserved (acting seemed pretty sketchy to me), I believe he lost sight of the exact build-up of the atmosphere, using the enclosed space to create the feeling of claustrophobia and daring approach to social topics such as the right of women to decide about abortion (in general it can be said that this is a feminist film). Of course, the 1974-75 critic could not have anticipated that the film will open the way to other horror films that take place in the student environment such as the series 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' . But there are at least two scenes close to masterpiece that he should not have missed. In one of them a girl's father and the mother of another girl - both disappeared - search their daughters at night in a frozen park. A body is found. To whom it belongs? The whole scene is rendered in its profound horror just filming two parents, there not need to see any body to understand whose death has been confirmed. Groovy and psychologically excellent. The second great scene is the final and I will not tell anything about it, so that I do not deprive anybody of the pleasure of a viewing which I recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent film - definitely thought about it when I went to sleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film - it was tense and left you guessing who was next and who the killer was. A fair warning, on one of the phone calls the language used is obscene and really offensive, but the rest is not bad. The killer is very scary!!! The noises he makes are very scary and disturbing. To be honest, the killings are not graphic at all (as to be expected of such an old film). I was a bit worried about it at the start (the film is made out to be a slasher movie) but it is not in the least bit gory. The biggest question of the movie is who the killer is and we never actually see him/her so it leaves it to your imagination what he looks like!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Canadian/slasher flick is better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Created when both Canadian cinema and slasher movies were in their infancy, Black Christmas is a film that effectively creates a creepy atmosphere with solid production values. It follows a familiar plot where a college sorority is receiving obscene phone calls, before each of the girls is murdered in the house. Eventually, the police trace the calls and they're finding they're coming from the house, too. I wondered if this movie started the cliché- I just looked it up and see the urban legend goes back to the '60s. It's not much of a surprise that the calls were coming from the house, even overlooking how well-known the cliché is now- for one thing, the killer is clearly in the house, and at another point, it's mentioned there's two lines.Some parts of this movie are well-done. Take the fact that one of the girls is killed while children are downstairs singing Christmas carols. That's juxtaposition reminiscent of the baptismal scene in The Godfather, though not as great. The movie is a little silly after the call is traced- Jess could have saved her skin instantly by taking three steps towards the door and going out to the police. Instead, she goes up the stairs. Reminds me of Tippi Hedren asking Hitchcock why she would go into the room at the end of The Birds (1963). Hitchcock's reply: "Because I told you to."I heard this movie described as a whodunit, but it's not much of a whodunit. The movie leads you to believe the protagonist Jess' boyfriend Peter is the killer even before the police identify him as a suspect. Then it's revealed it's not him... it's not entirely clear who it is. It could just be some random guy. That was kind of cheap, and the implication that he killed Jess, while cold and creepy, wouldn't have been as satisfying as the damsel-in-distress killing the bad guy. Oh well- Black Christmas works, and is a fine film for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On Christmas Eve a crazed killer sneaks into a girls' sorority house where he starts making frightening, obscene phone calls to the girls downstairs and picking off the residents one by one. The premise of this hugely influential shocker, which is one of several films credited with starting the stalk-n-slash genre, sounds silly, because how can he do all the things he does without any of the girls noticing? But Roy Moore's screenplay and intelligent actually turn this problem into an asset by the murder juxtaposing with - among others - the girls laughing very loud about a present they've just given to their landlord and a group of young kids singing Christmas Carols. Not only does it explain why the murder goes unnoticed, it also adds some very dark, sardonic humor to the proceedings. All this makes for a very intelligently written, well-acted and at times truly scary horror film, with possibly the most memorable final shots ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indirectly influenced modern slasher movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas is a movie to watch not for entertainment, but for its influence on modern horror. Most haven't seen this film when compared to Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street, much less heard of it, aside from the poor 2006 remake. There isn't much about this movie that screams brilliance. Despite a relatively low-budget, it isn't filmed too well, and even though you may care about the protagonists, the acting isn't note-worthy (although John Saxon never hurts); but how the villain is portrayed; through first-person view and his M.O. of making phone calls to his victims; paved a way for modern slasher films. His tactics have been done in previous movies from the 40s through 60s, but was brought together in Black Christmas.John Carpenter, or someone involved with the original Halloween, stated that without Black Christmas, Halloween, a better and more influential horror film, would never have been made. When you watch both films, it's easy to see why; the influence this film had on Halloween is almost immediately recognized.Even without taking influence into account, this is still a film worth watching, but knowing what it did for great horror films that came after it makes it even better. It deserves a lot more recognition than it has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well-Done Horror/Thriller Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if this review will have spoilers, but just in case I thought I better warn of the possibility. The acting in this picture is excellent, and the movie is not only scary, but sometimes downright funny as well. Olivia Hussey is an excellent lead, although I couldn't tell if she was attempting an American accent at times(She's actually British). Margot Kidder was very,very good. I must be honest and say that two things bothered me about the picture, and kept it from achieving greatness.One was the fact that the picture clearly attempts to pin the murders on one particular character, so much so that it soon becomes obvious that this person could not be the killer. Otherwise, the movie couldn't surprise us at the end with a different revelation. I think that if the movie had presented other characters as possible suspects, it would've worked better. The second problem for me was the behavior of the Olivia Hussey character at a key moment after she receives a phone call containing information that is crucial to her being able to exit the house alive. While 9 out of 10 people would've taken that information and literally run with it, she astoundingly does the exact opposite, making her a prime candidate for a Darwin Award in my opinion. Although one could say that she was only thinking of her friends in those moments, her behavior was a complete bummer for me, and caused me to lose sympathy for her. Apart from those 2 issues, the picture worked for me. Again, I must comment on how good the acting is. You simply don't see such good work very often in a horror picture. The direction is also quite good, with some great atmosphere. How did Bob Clark go from this to sleazy trash like Porky's?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Horror/Slasher Flick!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, Keir Dullea, Andrea Martin and John Saxon star in this 1974 horror film. This takes place during Christmas time where a mysterious psychopath who calls himself, Billy sneaks into a sorority house and stalks the residents. Hussey (Romeo and Juliet) plays Jess, a young girl who begins getting unsettling phone calls from him and is also having trouble with her boyfriend, Peter (Dullea). Kidder (Superman) plays Barb, her alcoholic friend, Martin plays her other friend, Phyl and Saxon (A Nightmare on Elm Street) plays police Lieutenant, Fuller. This is a good horror/slasher flick with a decent cast, ominous score and it's one of the only films where the killer's identity is never revealed. I recommend this to any horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie truly scared me. The killer in the house concept always scares me but this takes it to a whole new level. The killer makes weird phone calls and hides out in the attic. The ending was probably the scariest part of the movie. The twist was great. The kills were disturbing and intense. The movie is dark and has a sinister feel to it. It never reveals who the killer is. It is some random guy that gets into the house. There are a few bloody scenes. It is one of the best slasher movies ever made. The movie was realistic and clever. This is the scariest movie ever made. The whole movie had a creepy feel to it. I really liked this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chirstmas time is my favorite season, it's hard to say why may'be because it something that brings togetherness which to me is it's true spirit. It's also a time where we believe we are the safest, however as an old saying goes s... happens, it doesn't matter what time of year it is. This is one of my favorite horror/Chirstmas films of all time if you can believe that.This film was not just one of the first slasher films but also one's set in a season. The fact that this was set up in the Christmas time was a risky move and I felt it was a good risk, who'd of thought Christmas in the horror genre could be a great combo. Let alone the fact this was the late great Bob Clark's first Christmas film where his second is of course my favorite Christmas film of all time "A Christmas Story" so two in a row isn't bad.The production value is great, it was made on a low or modest budget and I really felt they used it well and right. The setting was in a neighborhood and a Sorority House that looked like any house and neighborhood I'd pass by which gives the film a sense of familiarity; let alone most of the film takes place in the Sorority House.The cast is good Margot Kidder as Barb is a character you love to dislike because she is practically a dirtbag on wheels, but she just has some really funny spitfire lines. John Saxton is good as the level headed Lt. Fuller, tirelessly hunting down the elusive killer.But I mainly really like Olivia Hussey as Jess. This is one of those underrated actresses I really like (and on a sidenote "Romeo and Juliet" one of my favorite movies). I'll level with you sometimes I like actors and actresses that are under the radar a lot more than ones that are in the limelight way too long.Anyway back to the jist of things, the character Jess I really like she's good protagonist that is fraking gorgeous with the warm persona to boot, smart, has desires/ambitions, but most importantly is a person that can hold her own whether it be standing up to her blowhole boyfriend (Jess deserves someone better). I like that little drama with her character which made her sympathetic in my book, she has this dilemma and she chooses to deal with it a certain way but of course her boyfriend disagrees and is a complete dirtbag to her just spouting horsecrap to her. I'll admit at that moment I wanted to punch him and yell "Frak You" because I always believe a good significant other should always respect and understand the others feelings in certain matters no matter what. But most importantly hold her own physically against the killer.But what makes this film great and hold up is in it's suspense and creepy, moody atmosphere it invokes which I'll admit gave me the chills. The music is great I really like as the killer first enters there's some sort of eerie tone, as well as the end credit some of Silent Night which has a dark tone to it.I really like the plot it's a simple but it feels plausible, whose to say something like this can't happen; it also made me concerned as to how safe our secure our neighborhoods and homes are. Like in most suspense thriller has always been in being one step ahead of the protagonist. Throughout the film at the moments when nothing really happens yet, we always have that looming fact in our head that the killer in the house and up there, and he's about to do something any minute. In moments like that I'm always thinking "Don't go up to that attic." or "Cmon get the frak out of house, don't spend another night." We just constantly feel unsafe and hope the protagonist can find out this fact on time before it's too late.It's true we never really see what the killer looks like but this is a great think because this gives the killer the element of enigma, the crazed killer is simply who he is evil that's all we need to know. The cinematography is great I love the point of view shots which are great, where we are literally seeing the perspective of the killer. This really adds to the suspense because it adds to the step ahead element, from just some actions or even those noises he makes like in those creepy phone call scenes, it really gives you an idea how truly crazy and psychotic the antagonist is.And I like the feeling of isolation, from the fact most of this film takes place in the nighttime, the snow, the cold, and moments when a character or certain character is alone. Once again you feel unsafe because in times like that you know that the killer could possibly make his move and usually does. But it's also a time where all the chips are down for the protagonist and we hope he/she can successful fight back and survive.Black Christmas will make your skin crawl.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A psychopath stalks young girls at a sorority house during the holiday season in "Black Christmas". This Canadian made horror movie is by far the best of it's kind I've ever seen. It falls under the categories of "killer is in the house" and "holiday horror", therefore is compared to such classics as 'When a Stranger Calls' and 'Halloween'. The thing is that Black Christmas was made before both of those, yet never got recognition over the years. The plot is pretty simple. A group of sorority sisters get obscene phone calls around Christmastime. It all seems fairly harmless until we see one of the girls murdered and then stored in the attic by the killer. The rest of the characters go to the police to report her missing. After receiving more disturbing phone calls, the cops tap the phone to find out what location the calls are coming from. As the movie moves along, we see a few more people murdered leading to the shocking scene in which the lead character jess is told that "the calls are coming from inside the house".The plot sounds simple and has been done to death in eighties slashers, but Black Christmas TRULY does it best. So many things about this movie are done so right. The caller is not your average deep voiced creeper. His ramblings range from high pitched squeals about "Billy and Agnes", and get even more twisted towards the end. The sounds the killer makes when he's alone with the dead bodies is so unnerving, I've never watched anything like it. The suspect list is short and really only includes the boyfriend Peter. We see throughout the film that he is a very troubled guy and you really start to believe that he is the caller/killer.Despite this being a creepy horror flick, there are a lot of laughs especially from the character of Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) and Barb (Margot Kidder). Mrs. Mac is the house mother who loves her booze and loves her cat Claude. She has to be one of my favourite horror characters of all time. The acting is top notch from Waldman and Kidder, but also from our leads Olivia Hussey/Andrea Martin/John Saxon/Keir Dullea. Black Christmas is one of the most frightening and terrifying horror films of all time. It's got the premise of a slasher flick, with out the blood and gore. It uses shadows, creepy phone calls and a mystery in the story that leaves us in fear and with many unanswered questions. This film by the brilliant Bob Clark should be seen by all!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Since its Christmas i thought i'd review this Classic Film Black Christmas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best horror films I've, seen! and I love it.I feel that this film is underrated and overlooked and some people don't realise how good it actually is.I was very impressed by this film the first time i saw it and it has been in my head ever since. This film has everything,great acting,great likable characters a nice location,and a story that works very well. Since this is such an old film i'm sure that a lot of people have seen it so i don't have to explain much of the story,Its about a crazed killer stalking a bunch of girls at their sorority house on campus and the killer starts killing people one by one. This may sound like your typical horror movie but believe me its Not!. This movie works well because of its atmosphere and its creepiness. I found this to be a very dark and chilling film it was also suspenseful and had some mystery behind it,and i quite liked the mystery,it makes a nice change because most horror films just have a bunch of kills but there seemed to be more to this film than just killings.I guess i just thought this film had more of a story to it than most horror films do. There are a lot of chilling and creepy scenes in this film that will make your skin crawl and my personal favourite was the weird phone calls,i thought they were done well,and the killer spoke in a way that made your skin crawl.he was creepy and his voice was creepy. The actor that played the killer did a good job and i thought this film had some good idea's like the killer hiding in the attic of the girls sorority house i thought that was a great idea and i found it creepy that he was up there watching people out the window and nobody knew he was up there and the heavy breathing from the killer is also very creepy especially when we don't see him.I liked him as a villain and i liked the lead girl Olivia Hussey she was pretty and i found her likable in the film and she played her role well and the rest of the cast were good too.I liked the whodunit aspect of the film and I thought the twist was clever and the ending was effectively Creepy.This is a classic film and deserves a watch,its highly recommended.This excellent film deserves a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came across this movie by accident - I was looking at the Horror movie boards and came across one asking slasher fans to compare the original Friday The 13th to the original Halloween. Surprisingly many people answered that this movie is better than both.The plot of this movie is that a sorority house is on it's Christmas break - most of the girls are going to leave. We then know that somebody is making obscene phone calls to them, when one girl is packing her bags she gets suffocated by an unseen killer inside the house. The killer then puts her up in the attic which nobody seems to go up to. The next morning her father was waiting there to meet her and doesn't, this arouses suspicion and leads him to go to the police after hearing nobody has seen her since the night before. They then organise a search party to find her.After that another girl tells her boyfriend she is pregnant and doesn't want to have it. Soon the search party finds a murdered kid. Soon afterwards (after the pregnant girl reports this) the police tap into their phone to find out where the calls are coming from.That will be all I will say to you about this. I will not say anything else - but if you want to see a Slasher/Mystery that ties up all the loose ends then don't watch this. If you want to see a movie that has no sense of closure then I will suggest this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas (1974) re-watch as one of the earliness slasher movies, even few years before big know slasher movie Halloween. I am little shocked that it did not get a sequel and I a, clad it didn't.If you are looking for slasher to make you Jump, this movie won't do it at all, there no real scare scenes to make you jump however, this movie dose not try to scare you at all in that way,Some may find this movie little out dated now and s tad boring if have already seen other slasher movies, like Friday and Halloween movies. However I found this to me very intense, they did, add some dark humour intothe mix, which was nice and didn't feel campy at all, worked really well with the rest of the movie. At Christmas, at the sorority house, girl are unaware that stranger, who making phone calls as broken into the house. We don't get to see who that person is at all, that makes little bit more creepy, as you have no idea who or why, his in this house for most of the movie, you do get to see parts of him in the movie. The deaths in this movie are not gory or anything but there are really good death scenes , which I think are way before there time. I love the final scenes of the movie, how is pans around the whole house and still mangers to keep tension until very last second of the movie. The acting was really good from everyone in whole cast, there maybe one or two that acted a bit over the top, it didn't bother to much. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skin-Crawling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the vast majority of slasher films, "Black Christmas" received very negative reviews upon it's released. This Canadian film however has since risen to cult status over the years, with many people declaring it the first ever slasher film. It is one of the first, alright... but everyone appears to have forgotten the 1963 slasher "Blood Feast", which I believe was the first slasher film ever made. Regardless, "Black Christmas" is a film deserving of all it's praise, because despite it's many faults, it's one hell of a creepy and atmospheric horror film. Successfully laying the foundations for future slasher films to come - such as John Carpenter's "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "When a Stranger Calls" and "The House on Sorority Row" - "Black Christmas" is the granddaddy of the slasher craze of the 80's. Unfortunately, I watched the 2006 remake a few years ago, and I only got around to watching the original a few weeks ago - which brought me to appreciate certain aspects of the remake (Such as the back-story concerning Billy) but it also made me realise something that the majority of horror films these days haven't got - gritty atmosphere. And when I say that, I mean that "Black Christmas" folks is absolutely skin crawling and intense in some scenes. I recall near the end as the camera slowly moves around the house in silence before moving up into the attic a horrible, heavy feeling in my gut of trepidation. 'Billy', the lunatic in the attic who kills these young women is as terrifying as his anonymity, which many people have complained about over the years but really, he is only scary because we never see him and at the end... we are given no answers regarding to who? why? and how?It's the holidays, and a sorority house is closing for the Christmas and while the girls party and pack their suitcases before heading home, they begin to receive obscene phonecalls from a strange man who makes horrible animal noises and screams down the phone in between obscenities. It's not until one of the girls goes missing that the girls begin to worry about this creep. Her conservative father comes to the sorority house to report her missing. The police aren't concerned... writing it off that the girl is probably locked up in a cabin somewhere with her boyfriend (Much to her father's horror, of course). It's not until the discovery of a dead child in the park that Lt. Fuller (John Saxon) becomes concerned and taps the phone line. As the girls remain in the house, they begin to get picked off one by one by the lunatic, who is in fact hiding up in the attic and using the housemother's phone...While it's a tense and very atmospheric film, "Black Christmas" for the most part is quite slow to build up. However, despite that, the editing is quite good. What makes it slow is the screenplay, as there are a lot of unnecessary scenes that just delay the action and undermine some of the gritty tension. Certain aspects of the film should be taken with a pinch of salt, because otherwise they would only drag the film down completely (Such as the ending when the girl is left alone in the house with only one cop standing outside). The acting is quite decent, and John Saxon (Who would later play the part of the cop and one of the parents in "A Nightmare on Elm Street") is brilliant as Lt. Fuller. We never see the killer, or learn anything about him, which I felt worked really well and made this linger in my mind after. The remake created a background to the character and needless to say is a far more violent and bloody film. But what it can't match the original for is dread and good old-fashioned grittiness. This Canadian slasher certainly deserves some recognition as being one of the earliest entries in the genre, however, is it on par with the likes of "Halloween"? Not really? although we can appreciate how many techniques were laid down here for future films to come. "When a Stranger Calls" and "The House on Sorority Row" certainly have this to credit. In a nutshell, it's very slow in places, but that rarely takes away from the gritty and taut nature of this truly skin-crawling film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing the fun but definitely trashy remake of Black Christmas sparked interest to see the original. Definitely worth watching, and definitely influential.I can definitely see how this film may have influenced When A Stranger Calls and even Halloween, which is more popular and well-known than this. It has a similar set-up, with a slow pace. I liked the pace, have nothing against it, but I did think that the film broke the suspense many times by cutting away to other things. There was one scene that really scared me though, and it's the scene right before a girl screams at the body in the park, when we hear the 'stranger' laughing in the attic and then he goes crazy hitting the body of the murdered girl and we see the body of the woman as well. The shot of the girl's face covered in the plastic sheeting is horrifying as well. Ultimately, I enjoyed this, but honestly I did expect better. I do think that the original Halloween is better (although Olivia Hussey beats Curtis, simply because she's just too cute). I also liked how the film starts with one character, making me think that was the lead and then it transitions into another. All in all, good, and although more kudos for this it isn't THAT much better than the stylized and trashy version of the remake. One question though, was the backstory of the killer in the remake completely made up?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A precursor to Halloween. I only mention that because the comparisons are rife and have been since I first read of the two.The similarities are undeniable (Carpenter used Black Christmas as a model essentially) but Black Christmas is able to stand on it's own. The acting is actually slightly better on the whole than most slasher films (note a young Margot Kidder and John Saxon is a fine b-movie actor). With a dark sense of humour and a creepy unnerving atmosphere (good use of the POV shot)and a relatively good murder-mystery plot, Bob Clarke's original vision for Black Christmas is one of the best films of it sub-genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe this movie was made in 1974 - In my opinion it is way ahead of its time. I'm perplexed as to why this movie isn't talked about more in the horror genre. For its time I think it's extremely innovative and definitely would've been a massive inspiration for John Carpenter when he made Halloween four years later. The beginning of the 1978 Halloween is definitely influenced by the beginning to this movie where we have a POV shot of the mysterious killer making his way into the house. This movie can be somewhat slow in parts but if you stick with it you'll find it enjoyable. The tension throughout this movie is incredible. There are some scenes where the camera is just fixed on the attic door and strange noises can be heard coming from there. Very creepy.

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly entertaining slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film i was worried i would be wasting one and a half hours of life. As the first scene started i was moaning about how stupid and predictable it was when the girl wandered over to the closet when it rattled. When she solves it i let my guard down, and jumped a meter of my seat (no exaggeration) when the killer appears from nowhere and slaughters her. (previous to watching this i watched Ammytiville horror with out flinching) weirdly, i clapped at how it made me jumped.As the film progressed i became more joyful as the kills became increasingly twisted. (something i seek for when watching slashers) Another reason this movie is good is because the plot is original, unlike most 70's/80's horror's. The only reason i didn't score this movie a perfect ten is because their is a lack of character development in my opinion, with non of the girls in the house being a sole victim or taking a lead in the film. One last thing i put Black Christmas down on is the obvious lack of comedy, with all the film being directly focused on the plot with not many, or no, jokes, puns or funnies. However, i understand some fans may be happy about this.in summary, a must watch for any slasher fan with a spare 2 hours on their hand, but beware, this is not a film for those who are jumpy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first read 10 reviews before i watched BLACK Christmas...... Almost all the reviews said that this is the MOST scariest film ever......... Mostly i don't agree with them because the movie didn't scare me.......The direction is very slow than i expected... First 15 minutes of the movie are not much interesting... But as soon as the killer starts to kill one by one... the movie was very interesting........You need to have more patience to watch the movie... But at last I am sure you will be terribly shocked.... Watch the movie till the end titles appear.... It won't disappoint you....Though, if you don't like my review... Please watch this movie... It is very good..... BLACK Christmas is a Good suspenseful thriller.......I give this 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A top-notch horror film from the 1970s, Black Christmas' only drawback is that it occasionally drags. There are a handful of times that you wish things would speed up but perhaps Bob Clark is just building the suspense, because once things begin to happen you'll be far more ensnared than you'd otherwise be.The story concerns a sorority house where the girls receive prank calls from a psycho. When Clare (Lynne Griffin) goes missing, her father (James Edmond) shows up to locate her. Since Clare didn't make it home her sorority friends grow more concerned with the obscene caller and wonder if he is to blame for Clare's disappearance. But Clare's loss is just the beginning as the girls get picked off one-by-one.STORY: $$$$ (The script is really quite strong. Characterization is not forfeited for blood and guts in this tight little slasher. Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea play a couple who bicker over her pregnancy, Margot Kidder is a lush who seems to be following in the footsteps of their alcoholic house mother Marian Waldman. You will like these characters. Suspense is in large supply as well. Director Bob Clark has a knack for placing you on the edge of your seat and then giving said seat a swift kick at the right time to jar your senses).ACTING: $$$ (The acting is generally strong along the board. Genre favorite John Saxon is terrific as usual in the role of the town sheriff but he is upstaged in the acting department in his own precinct by Doug McGrath as Sergeant Nash. McGrath masterfully portrays the rube desk sergeant who is the butt of every joke. The scene where Margot Kidder leaves him the sorority house' phone number is a riot! Keri Dullea is effectively pompous as Olivia Hussey's emotional unstable boyfriend and Miss Hussey shines as the mother hen even though she opts not be a mother. Art Hindle, man-fur and all, does a fine job as Clare's jock boyfriend while Margot Kidder gives one of her best performances as the crass Barb).NUDITY: None</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proves That Slasher Flicks Can Be Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is to slasher flicks what "The Changeling" (1980) is to horror flicks: intelligent, somewhat reserved, and representing the cream of the crop for the genre. Can a low-gore slasher flick really work? You bet ya! Much better than most of the bloodbaths earning millions of dollars nowadays. "Black Christmas" is big on atmosphere and fear - but quite reserved regarding dismembered bodies and blood spatter. Also unusual for this genre, the acting is competent, and the potential victims are believable, likable characters - not insufferable morons. On top of all this, the fact that Olivia Hussey is in the cast makes this film a really good choice. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Little Thriller...But Still Not "Halloween"!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read and heard over the past couple years that this 1974 thriller/slasher is really the start or beginning to the horror/slasher genre, instead of the 1978 blockbuster hit "Halloween". Well, I realize that "Black Christmas" was 4 years before "Halloween"...this is true. But, folks, after viewing "Black Christmas" it still is NOTHING compared to "Halloween"!! Anyone can come up with a good plot idea for a slasher and/or low budget horror flick. It takes the right actors, but more importantly the right cinematography, lighting, music, colors, sets, etc...that truly make the movie. I'm sorry, but "Halloween" still rules as the "granddaddy" of slasher flicks! "Black Christmas" was a fun and entertaining slasher to watch...but most of the time I was laughing and found it funny. Margot Kidder was hilarious and the rest of the cast had their silly or funny moments as well. The only two true freaky and pretty scary aspects to the movie were the first kill (the guy popping out of the closet with the plastic clothes cover) and the phone calls and/or the bizarre/terrifying voices and/or things said to the girls when they answered. Other than that, this thriller was not that scary nor did it really have me on the edge of my seat."Halloween" truly was terrifying and much more "realistic". It used freaky lighting, bizarre music (the unforgettable theme), and much scarier kills than "Black Christmas". Therefore, it was much more popular and remembered...making it an instant cult-classic. Because of that it also will always be viewed as the real jump-start to the slasher genre. Don't get me wrong, I loved "Black Christmas" and enjoy watching it too--as I'm a horror fan and "BC" is one of my favorite editions. But..."Halloween" is still in a whole different realm and a cut above the rest of the other slashers--and will always be the alpha and omega of "Boogey Man" flicks! ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oft overlooked and undercredited, Black Christmas is the granddaddy of the North American slasher film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare, little-known horror films that deserves to be recognized for its inventiveness. Though the story might seem like a terrible horror movie cliché today, Bob Clark's Black Christmas set the bar, and the mold, for the American slasher movie, and it set it extremely high. Released a full 4 years before Halloween, its impact on contemporary North American horror films cannot be overstated. The story, that of a psychotic madman terrorizing a sorority house, is simple, straightforward, and terrifiying. The twist ending has been criticized by some for its ambiguity, but I think that the final 15 minutes of this movie are superbly done and rank as some of the most frightening ever committed to celluloid.To quote a reviewer whom I think got it right, BC is "cold, classy, and straightforward." It is an absolute must for fans of horror thrillers, as it definitely is THE prototypical slasher pic.10/10Paul Voorhies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorority girls are stalked by a shrieking psycho-killer who dispenses bloody yuletide cheer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie scared the be-jabbers out of me, and that is saying something.The plot is simple: girls in a sorority house are menaced by a psycho killer who, for reasons known only to himself, has set up shop in their attic. It's the Christmas season and most of the girls have gone home for the holidays, but three of the sisters -- Jess (Olivia Hussey), Barb (a fabulously foulmouthed and over-the-top Margot Kidder) and Phyl (Andrea Martin) remain behind with their house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marion Waldman).It seems that the house has been plagued with bizarre phone calls. Not exactly obscene, the calls tend toward ranting gibberish, insane laughter, horrible screams, and some kind of unholy crooning. The calls are one of the truly frightening things in the film; they pour out of the phone like the soundtrack to a nightmare, and you find yourself wondering why the girls don't just hang up. Sensibly, they call in the police, who come to put a tap on the phone.The first girl to disappear is Clare Harrison (Lynn Griffin), whose father sounds the alarm when she fails to meet him to be taken home for Christmas. The father, played to jittery perfection by James Edmond, spends most of the movie nervously asking cops, sorority sisters, boyfriends, and anyone else he can find, if they know what has happened to his daughter. Unbeknownst to the rest of the sisters, Clare has taken up residence in the attic, where the killer has posed her in a rocking chair with a plastic bag over her head and a baby doll in her lap.Clare is shortly joined in oblivion by Mrs. Mac, who makes the mistake of clambering up into the attic to look for her cat and ends up staying for eternity, suspended from the ceiling by a chain -- attached to a hook embedded in her throat. The psycho picks the girls off in a leisurely way, eventually leaving only the luminously beautiful Olivia Hussey -- who, according to the Horror Film Rules of Conduct, should be a victim of the killer because of a subplot involving the fact that she is pregnant and wants to have an abortion. She argues with her boyfriend, Peter (in one memorable exchange, he calls her a selfish bitch and accuses her of aborting the baby "...like you were having a wart removed!"); Jess eventually comes to suspect that Peter may be the killer because the killer begins incorporating bits of her arguments in his calls.Margot Kidder plays Barb a little too broadly for sympathy; at the beginning of the film, we discover that her mother prefers to spend Christmas with a new boyfriend ("You're a gold-plated whore, mother," Margot snarls into the phone, scotch in one hand and cigarette in the other); this serves to explain why Barb spends the movie drinking, smoking, dropping double-entendres, swearing like a pirate -- and having anxiety-induced asthma attacks. By the time the killer gets to her, you feel sorry for them both.There are several memorably frightening moments in the film, but one in particular will make you squirm. In a classic early-slasher-genre trick, the phone tap reveals that the obscene calls are coming from inside the house -- specifically from the housemother's bedroom -- and a terrified Jess discovers the bloodied bodies of Phyl and Barb. In the bedroom with the bodies, an eye stares at Jess from a crack in the closet door, and the voice of the killer taunts her from the darkness. Jess slams the door on the killer -- who immediately begins to shriek in a way that suggests damnation and rage unfit for human consumption. The shrieking continues as he chases Jess around the house; eventually I had to mute the TV because I seriously could not listen to the shriek. It was that horrible.The end of the movie is as bleak as the contents: Jess kills Peter with a fireplace poker because she thinks he's the killer; the police break in and find Jess and the dead Peter in the basement. A doctor sedates Jess and puts her to bed, then insists on getting poor hapless Mr. Harrison to a hospital ("This man is suffering from shock!" -- which made me want to say "Dude, what do you think that GIRL is suffering from?") leaving Jess alone and sleeping in a darkened room.As the police cars leave, posting only a single cop as a guard, the killer climbs, chuckling, back down out of the attic and the phone begins to ring.The movie is atmospherically creepy, and the voice of the psycho is enough to give a person nightmares forever; there are a few spots where the director took the easy way out ("The calls are coming from inside the house!" prominent among them) but on the whole this is a hell of an effective horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen in a while and it had this effect on me even though I watched it for the first time in 2011, after watching all kinds of horror movies throughout my life.First in a long time, I have cared for a leading character in a horror movie which, in turn, kept the tension up for me till the end. What I find most disturbing is the voice or the voices of Billy and his confused which seems to be repeating a pattern of behavior which began with a past event and seeking help at the same time (while he does not do anything about it).One point which worths discussing is the point on misogyny in Black Christmas. The movie has enough points which justifies the idea that slasher, as a genre, tends to be misogynistic at least in its tone. It is clear that the movie points out the increasing independence of women. Women in Black Christmas, including the housemother, are portrayed as decadent in some way. Even the housemother who is supposed to take care of the girls in the sorority house has an alcohol problem and does not care about the concerns of the parents.Especially the character of Barb and her murder is a classic case of punishment of a decadent woman with a phallic object - as some critiques would put it.However, leading character, Jess, is also different from the standard virgin heroine of slashers. She has a baby from a premarital sexual relationship and moreover she wants an abortion because she chooses her career over building a family. While this is true, she is also the girl seemingly most rational and reasonable.Jess is not killed at the end of the movie; however, since Billy is still in the house, it might be assumed that she will not survive the night, then we may stick to the classical interpretation of misogyny. But I think that by choosing such an independent and rational woman as its lead, movie opens the way for various interpretations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and chilling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas is a truly eerie slasher movie that influenced every similar film that came after it -- and very few that came after improved upon the genre.The cinematography made every character's move add to the uneasiness in the film, as the camera gave the viewer the killer's point of view, or it followed the girls up the stairs and around the upstairs hall. The dark interiors of the sorority house, the winter gloom outside, and the blanket of snow all contributed to the creepy feeling that permeates the film. A couple things -- aside from Barb's incessant crude sex talk -- annoyed me: Mrs. Mac lost a shoe as she was being dragged into the attic -- did anyone find it? Why on earth did the police not search the attic? And what doctor or cop in his/her right mind would not have taken Jess to the hospital?When I saw Black Christmas for the first time, I was disappointed with the ending. Upon watching it again, I find the ending nothing short of brilliant. For isn't it more frightening to suspect the killer is still out there (or *in* there, as the case may be), and isn't it more chilling *not* to understand the motives for his actions?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the month of October I make it my goal to feast on a filmic diet of strictly horror. This year was my second year in what I hope will be a continual tradition. Being as it was only the second year, I also did my best to only watch film that were new to me so that I could get the fullest effect.I love the feeling of being scared by a film, but as I've immersed myself further into movies I find it very hard to be frightened anymore. I keep looking to find a film that can fill me with that same uneasiness and terror that films like Psycho did when I was younger. I am often disappointed. There are many good horror films that I can appreciate on an artistic level, but which don't reach me on a visceral one, and oh so many more that can't overcome the obstacles of time and hype.I had never heard of Black Christmas until this year. I had wandered on to IMDb disappointed yet again with a film that vowed to pack a punch, when out of the wilderness someone pointed to this film as one that had made their skin crawl. Being as I had been disappointed so many times before with similar claims, I tacked Black Christmas onto the Netflix list as a late night gory romp. I can't recall the last time I have been so pleasantly surprised.Black Christmas may seem like an old story at this point in time... murderous serial killer is making calls from inside the house...gasp...but even under the modern microscope I have to applaud the film. Never once do I feel like the director is talking down to me. The audience knows what's going on from the start. The story isn't meant to be a twist, but rather it wraps us up in this fear of knowing what is going on and being able to do nothing to stop it.The writing is wonderful, fresh and well acted with a good balance of humor that doesn't feel like it's trying too hard. What's even more wonderful though is what isn't said and what isn't seen. There is a mastery to this film in how much it lets the audience imagine, the what ifs and the images that it plants in your head without showing you anything.To me the film is a perfect blend of mental and emotional stimulation. And even after countless remakes and copycats, there were still elements of this film that were new to me. It felt like a blend of all of my favorite horror films without ever losing its own originality and entity.It'll be a long time before I can find another one as good as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Suspenseful Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Black Christmas this month I was honestly scared after I had watched it. It was really scary. You didn't know if the killer was Billy or the boyfriend.The film starts of quickly as an unseen, stalking psychopath returns to his home house on Christmas which is now a sorority house which is owned by girls who celebrate Christmas together every year. The killer sneaks into the attic of the house. Soon after, the girls start to get creepy, insane phone calls. They don't realize it's from the attic. In their own HOME! Soon after all of them are murdered.I loved this film and it honestly kept me tuned in to watch the rest. It's like your watching Halloween (1978) all over again. Word of warning though that this is a very slow &amp; long film that goes on forever though for a film like this, slow is good.I suggest you ignore the remake and watch the original. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked and underrated.....a Horror Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As other reviews have stated, this set the bar for all the imitator slasher flicks came after it....unfortunately, since it is a cheaply made little Canadian movie, it has been overlooked by most Horror Movie Historians. I once read a book of horror movie reviews, and like others, "Black Christmas" was not reviewed. I contacted the author by e-mail, and he replied by saying "Gosh-darn it....I STILL haven't seen that movie". If you love well-made, classic horror, please see this movie. Scared the CRAP out of me when I first saw it in the '70's. Still does today. The scene that still fills the viewer with dread is when the heroine discovers her two friends dead in the bedroom, and when she tries to force the door open and falls down, we see what was blocking the door.....and he's staring psychotically at her through the crack in the door..... Well filmed, well acted and very well directed. Enjoy...and for cryin' out loud, make sure your attic door and all the windows are locked!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuinely creepy and well-written slasher film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had previously written about the film The Blair Witch Project, dubbing it "the best horror movie of all time". Well, it's 2010; I admit that my review was a poorly-written and biased opinion on a film that is, yes, creepy--but calling it "the best horror movie of all time" is a bit of an overstatement. I had not seen Black Christmas.Onward...This film is very ominous, realistic and even funny. Black Christmas has a plot that was later used in a lot of slasher films as well: a group of girls living in a sorority house are stalked by a-- well in this case it's hard to define the character of Billy, disturbing and morbid? The comedic parts are just as great as the scary scenes too. Like when Barb (Margot Kidder) is describing to a cop the address of the sorority house as "Fellatio 20880". The ending, in my opinion made the movie even better. (Spoiler alert) Jess (Olivia Hussey) kills her boyfriend, thinking he's the killer. The cops arrive and let her rest. As she rests, the camera pans away and moves into the attic, where Billy whispers "Agnes, it's me Billy." *shiver* You must see this classic, don't bother for the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attacker in the attic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitting down on Christmas Night I wanted to watch something suitably seasonal so chose this classic '70s horror flick. I was expecting something very dated, overly leery, badly acted and with lashing of fake blood, thankfully I was wrong on all counts. With the exception of the scene where the police try to trace a phone call on a non-computerised telephone exchange it didn't seem that dated.Set in a Sorority house as college breaks up for Christmas and the girls prepare to go home. They start to receive a series of obscene phone calls and one of them disappears; the viewer knows that she has been killed by an unseen killer and dragged up to the house's attic. The police aren't interested at first believing she probably just went off with a boy. Eventually they take an interest but they are looking in the wrong places and never thing to search the house itself; the only person to look into the attic is promptly killed and isn't missed as she was meant to be going away.As the phone calls continue the police start to suspect the boy friend of the girl receiving the calls as the caller knows personal things that were said in the privacy of the house. Only once the police have realised the caller is on another line in the house does anybody realise they are dealing with a psychotic killer rather than just a pervert with a telephone.Director Bob Clark did a great job keeping things tense and avoids the current clichés of giving the killer unnatural strength or supernatural abilities to survive anything. There is no back story explaining why he is killing people which makes him creepier than some better known movie killers who have a mythology spanning several films. He also avoided gratuitous sex and nudity so if you go into this expecting to see showering sorority girls you will be disappointed, if you just want a good solid thriller you should have a good time. The actresses did a good job, especially Olivia Hussey as Jess, the main girl in the story and Margot Kidder as Barb, a girl who likes a drink and has a rather dirty mind, her joke to the policeman about a new telephone exchange was hilarious and perfectly delivered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, Subtle and Atmospeheric I'm impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got done watching this one awhile ago, and I'm seriously impressed. I thought it would be a cheap b-movie. I was wrong. Some say this film was the first to set the tone for the entire slasher sub-genre and I definitely see why. All the familiar elements are there like the subjective camera shot, stabbing scene, clever and rightful suspense, and the teenage women.The one thing I loved about this film was the killer. We never see the him, that is, anything that can identify him. All you see is shots of his hands, legs, and a couples shot of his eye. We never find out who he is, there's just a passing mention that his name is Billy. Having subtlety in a villain makes them more a effective sometimes. You don't know who he is but when you feel his presence, you really do feel it. It's awesome.What I didn't like was the profanity. This film has a serious obscenities problem. The guy in the Santa suit swearing in front of children, the sorority girls cursing to police, I mean, what the heck? About half the people in this movie swear too much and this was in 1974! Even today, most horror films don't have that much filthy language.Verdict: Awesome!! But dude, the swearing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tales From The Horror Genre #1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Christmas season in full swing, it seems appropriate to look back at one of the best holiday-themed horror films of all-time. Beginning with the ring of a telephone and ending with that same ring, a sure sign of the effectiveness of "Black Christmas" is revealed when you reflect back upon how this familiar sound changes over its duration. It starts as harmless background noise and, by the conclusion, becomes an ominous sign of horror lurking just upstairs. Olivia Hussey, Andrea Martin, and Margot Kidder star as sorority sisters plagued by increasingly threatening phone calls and eventually a mysterious and brutal killer. Though the film is utterly simple and lacks any thorough explanations of the killer's identity or motive, it is surprisingly effective in how it takes just a handful of elements and combines them to create an undeniably frightening film. In the end, it doesn't need to unmask the person committing the murders, and for very good reason; what he does is far more horrifying than who he is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really only heard there was an original film hearing about the remake, but this was is given four stars out of five, so I thought I might as well give it a try, from director Bob Clark (Porky's). Basically at a Canadian college campus the sorority house are planning their Christmas holiday, and they start things off with a big party. Throughout the night the house phone keeps ringing, it is a strange anonymous voice putting them on the edge with his weird high-pitched animal type noises and foul language. Soon enough things get worse, when Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) disappears, and the remaining girls call the police, who don't express much interest in helping. Meanwhile, Jess Bradford (Olivia Hussey) wants an abortion, going against the wishes of boyfriend Peter Smythe (Keir Dullea), and the police eventually decide to help finding the body of a 13-year-old girl. After all the other girls have disappeared, including Barbara 'Barb' Coard (Margot Kidder), Phyllis 'Phyl' Carlson (Andrea Martin) and housekeeper Mrs. 'Mac' MacHenry (Marian Waldman), Jess is the only one left. It is a psychopath committing all these scary acts, but we know it is worse when Lt. Kenneth Fuller (John Saxon) is told that the obscene phone calls are coming from inside the house. Also starring Art Hindle as Chris Hayden and James Edmond as Mr. Harrison. It had a catchy tag-line, "If this picture doesn't make your skin crawl, it's on too tight!", but the film itself isn't very catchy. The performances are okay, the death scenes are average, and the scares are pretty mild, I can't see fully how this deserves four stars, but I suppose it is something different than a cheery Christmas film, not a bad seasonal horror thriller. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film last Saturday evening. I thought that i was far better a movie than the remake of Black Xmas(2006). The actors were way better than in the remake. The film seemed to have a much more creepier feel to it. i really liked how the camera work was done which made it feel that you were being followed through the house. I think that it is best to be watched late at night with the lights out for full effect. I thought that there was good amount of gore in the film. as well as having a a good psychological feel to it so that you are on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen. The killings were done well especially one one with the girl having been suffocated with a plastic bag.I recommend this film for fans of all the 80's slasher films. such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980. You should feel quite afraid after watching this film (Enjoy!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas is one of those rare gems, a genuinely creepy horror film. I don't want to give to much away about the film but basically A group of girls in a sorority house start receiving obscene calls from somebody that they nickname "the moaner" the calls start getting worse and worse and people start going missing. I was not expecting that much from this film but as this was the first slasher movie I thought I owed it to myself to at least see this film , this film really does creep you out and the atmosphere is built up expertly, and unlike a lot of horror films that run out of steam half way through when the film ends you still feel creeped out by it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two outlooks, two different ratings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Black Christmas" was a pioneering movie. It's safe to say that this was one of the first if not THE first slasher-flick of all time. As such, the movie has a lot going for itself. Everything that would later become a cliché is established here: the POV-shot of the killer entering rooms, the creative ways of picking off victims one by one, the final girl, etc. "Black Christmas" invented it all. On top of that the movie has top notch direction and an artful cinematography, which is sometimes reminiscent of Dario Argento's work. The acting is fine for the most part, and the mysterious killer and his creepy phone calls give Michael Myers a run for the money. So, if we take all that into consideration, "Black Christmas" is a genuine horror masterpiece.However, a lot of time has passed and a lot of slasher movies have been made since 1974. If you watch this movie now for the first time, it won't do much for you. You've seen these ideas before and probably in a more shocking way. "Black Christmas" may have been the first movie to do it, but other movies were the ones who made the basic slasher-elements famous.That's hardly director Bob Clark's fault, of course. It's just that if you're not a cineaste, you won't care too much about whether or not this movie was inventive when it first came out. All you'll care about is whether it can surprise and entertain you still, and truth be told, if you've seen the "Halloween"- and "Friday The 13th"-flicks or any movies of their ilk, then "Black Christmas" probably won't blow you away.However, if you do care about historical movie facts, then you must see Bob Clark's true holiday classic (the "false" one being "A Christmas Story" from 1983). After all, "Psycho" is also respected for the effect it originally had on audiences mostly. Even Hitchcock's masterpiece seems tame and predictable from today's point of view, so why should you be more critical when it comes to judging "Black Christmas"? For horror buffs, this one is a must, anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas (1974) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The attic of a girl's sorority house during the holiday season becomes a nesting place for a grunting maniac, who scales the trellis one evening and begins to murder women amidst the snow and good cheer of Christmas carols. The madman uses the telephone to call the girls and taunts them with noises and deranged ramblings in a very unsettling manner. Olivia Hussey stars as the main innocent girl who is on the receiving end, with Margot Kidder as one of her no-nonsense loudmouth friends. The dependable John Saxon takes on the part of a police lieutenant who tries to help.The first thing I want to say about the film is that it's not unlike everything we've seen since in later slasher movies. Every cliché is present: the heavy-breathing psycho, the obscene phone calls; the terrified girl on the other end who is incredibly stupid; the grisly murder techniques; the killer's point of view shots... There is a sense of the familiar here, and I was almost prepared to give the movie a half-star less rating until I reminded myself .. this film came first, BEFORE all those other clones. Director Bob Clark has said that John Carpenter liked this film, and we can see some of its influence in Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, which often gets all the credit. But it's not the fault of the more rare BLACK Christmas that it spawned all the copycats which make it seem like one of them itself; I'd imagine this trend setter felt much more cutting edge in 1974, and that's why I gave it the extra boost it deserves. There is good and bad here ... I have yet to enjoy Margot Kidder in anything, and her drunken sleaze-mouth character here is annoying, as is the fat female den mom who's got a bottle of booze hidden everywhere in the house ... but not to worry. The killer, who's identity is a mystery, manages to be scary just through his eerie phone calls and creepy sounds. The idea of all this gruesome mayhem as a parallel to the joyous Christmas events happening on the side achieves the proper disturbing effect. The look of the large spooky house from the outside, complete with the image in the attic window, is haunting. The movie is not completely original, but it deserves extra credit for setting up so many now-patented and tried and true horror film clichés. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a holiday tradition, I make a point to view this at least once every December to get myself in the Christmas spirit. This year was no different and I have decided to review this old favorite once and for all.The ambiance is genuinely creepy and the Christmas theme being used in a horror movie is upsetting to see. I would not recommend this one to kids. "Black Christmas" is one of the first true slasher movies. A killer is on the loose and stalking members of a sorority house. We are not sure who it is and the ending is shocking. The killings are brutal. It's crazy to think that the guy who directed this went on to do such hits as "Baby Genuises..." He should have stuck to horror! Highly recommended classick that will sit with you for awhile after viewing. And avoid at all costs the Michael Bay remake for that is absolute garbage and just a sorry attempt to cash in on an awesome movie that DID NOT NEED TO BE REMADE.9 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine horror masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not just the godfather of all slashers, it's the godfather of all horror films. Black Christmas is a sharp edged gem that sadly never garnered the popularity that it's inferior ripoffs like Halloween did and in consequence never got the praise it much deserved. Depressing, really depressing.The director, Bob Clark, takes his time setting up a dark mood, and exploiting his eerie setting fully while giving us hints of slick style on the way (the killer POV shots and the slow motion). He also inter-cuts murder sequences with mundane events which makes the scenes quite effective. He gives us a solid script, excellent old fashioned suspense, and a strong atmosphere to rely on that oozes with an unrelenting creepiness.Character development sets this one apart from other horror films. Olivia Hussey is angelic as the film's resident Scream Queen. Her character, Jessica, is thinking about having an abortion; she's definitely not your modern day leading lady for a slasher film, which usually involves someone pure at heart, innocent and virginal. These troubles that Jessica goes through add depth to her character, making her impossible not to like and adding the reality of character flaws to the whole picture. The rest of the characters are given a lot of depth as well, and this really helps you sympathize for them.Music, like Halloween, is just as important of a factor as any horror classic. Perhaps it has to do with Peter, Jessica's boyfriend, being a pianist, that the scoring is a low and aggressive piano set. It's the part of the film that makes your creep bone crawl. Jessica receives a phone call from the killer, who shouts out "Billy!" "Agnes!" "What your mother and I must know is..." and other disturbing, seemingly meaningless quotes. His voice is dark, almost demonic, and uses multiple high and low tones that sometimes overlap each other. The question often comes up of whether or not the killer called "Billy", is possessed, or just very talented at what he does. The 2006 remake of Black Christmas, Black X-Mas, tries to answer every single question of what "Billy" is saying in the original, and explain his background. To do so completely destroys the purpose of Bob Clark's film, as the scariest aspect of Black Christmas is all of the things that you don't know. We enjoy wondering who the killer is, what his motive exactly is, where he came from, do we know him already? What is his motive? Where did he come from? Do we know him already? The film gives us just enough information and clues to chew on without providing straight out concrete answers. This allows the film to linger in our minds as we try to figure out what our own opinions are as to it's many mysteries. It's all in the mind, which is where the BEST creativity comes from (Blair Witch Project, Rosemary's Baby, etc). The lesser we see and the lesser we know, the better.Black Christmas was made before the thousands of clichés of the slasher genre became typical, and has impacted American slashers like few others. Halloween has the mystery of who the killer is nearly down pat; it was a holiday horror with a stalker and anonymous phone callers. When a Stranger Calls took the nerve smashing concept from Black Christmas and used it for the opening act, where "the calls were coming from inside the house." Many slashers to follow would use Black Christmas' "Is that you?" line when a character would wonder who is lurking about. Today, the creepy caller often gets spoofed (Student Bodies) or updated in the form of a less effective cell phone (Scream). This Canadian terror has influenced SO SO many artistic gems that it feels like a crime that it is rarely seen as the powerhouse it deserves to be acknowledged as. No doubt, if Bob Clark could've copyrighted the slasher movie concepts and clichés that he created, he would've been just as famous as John Carpenter or Wes Craven, maybe even more.It's simple (like Halloween) and doesn't require any additions to make it stronger. It's damn near flawless for gods sake! It's a truly fantastic masterpiece of horror cinema, the best horror film ever made. We never find out the answers to the killings at the house. This may be frustrating to some, but it's really a concept of genius, keeping the evil untouched and ready to haunt our minds on the night of December 24th.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror, see it now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the one I watched on Halloween but couldn't understand due to all the ruckus going on at the party. And now that I have sat down and watched it properly, I see exactly what makes this one such a classic.Black Christmas is one of those old school horror movies that knows what it's doing, unlike mostly every horror movie that comes out these days. The build-up is long and it sets a tangible mood - this is not a movie trying to rush itself into the blood and gore, which is not really one of the focal points of this movie anyway. Yes, there are stock characters, and there is some thin human conflict going on between them, but you actually care about these characters, and you don't really want to see them die. What a novel concept, right? This makes it all the more disturbing as the stalker's phone calls escalate in insanity and as the bodies begin to pile up. The acting is really good for these kinds of movies, too, with great performances from all of the characters.And goddammit, those phone calls get really, really creepy! I mean, I know what you're thinking; "oh, wow, a phone call, how can that be scary," but no, it is scary. I won't spoil the reasons why for those who haven't seen this gem yet, but the atmosphere of the whole thing is blackened, haunting, claustrophobic and memorable as Hell. This is all very believable, leaving no room for anyone to laugh and pan this movie off as unrealistic or silly. This could happen to anyone! And that, in a similar manner to Halloween, is perhaps the scariest thing about this movie.From before a time when horror equated to ridiculous special effects, gory amputated limbs and torture chambers, Black Christmas hits you hard no matter where or when you watch it, with a ferociously creepy mood, a calculating, dark atmosphere and just enough pizazz to have you looking under your bed this Christmas eve to make sure that there aren't any bogeymen coming to get you. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the creepiest films ever made - A great slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over Christmas break, a sorority house is terrorized by a mysterious obscene caller. Eventually, the terror increases as the sorority sisters are, one by one, viciously murdered by a psychopathic killer.Let me just say: With the proper viewing atmosphere, Black Christmas can, easily, be one of the creepiest and frightening films around. Stick yourself in a dark room with no light but the Christmas tree, make sure it's nice and snowy outside, and empty the house. Have all of those, and prepare to be scared out of your wits. Unfortunately for me this time around, all I had was the dark room and empty house. No tree, no snow. But, that didn't stop the film from being nearly as chilling. In addition to the chills the film delivers, it also succeeds in its technical aspects. Moore's script is very good, with a nice even flow throughout. It manages to flesh out the 'important' characters and make them seem more complete, even though some of the other characters are pretty much forgotten. Also, though some don't, I very much liked the lack of resolution. The late Bob Clark's direction, of course, was also damn fine. It worked well and took full advantage of the beautiful sorority house. The acting, on occasion, failed. Olivia Hussey, whom I never found to be a GREAT actress, was for the most part good, but still seemed a bit over-the-top on occasion. It wasn't enough to distract from the quality however, and can easily be overlooked. In the end, Black Christmas (1974) is a success of chilling slasher cinema that fans of such films as Halloween should truly love.Obligatory Christmas-Horror Elements:- Subgenre: Slasher- Christmas Carols: The soundtrack is primarily made up of holiday tunes.- Snow: That there is.- Person in a Santa suit: Yes, we see a Santa-clad person a few times.- Violence/Gore: It's not as 'bad' as the remake, but there is a bit. The deaths are certainly better here.- Sex/Nudity: None, although the phone calls are pretty graphic.- Scares/Suspense: Endless. This is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen and it definitely stirs deep.- Mystery: Absolutely. This is one of those rare films where the mystery lasts long after the credits roll - - -Final verdict: 7.5/10. See it! -AP3-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas '74: I haven't had this much fun since the original Scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant production and direction and the story is near air-tight. I love that it takes place at a time of year when it's not at all unusual for students to be away for extended lengths of time. I love that the film has no beginning and no ending. Our first call wasn't their first call and we end with "Billy" calling to see if there is anyone else in the house. It's like a high-speed train we just happened aboard as its about to derail. All of the characters are bright and/ or funny and likable in some way... yes, even Peter. There isn't the ditz that you can't wait to see knocked off nor is there the predictable "first to go" character. I guess there is something to be said for perfect pacing. The only possible flaw is Billy's phone calls being inaudible through the walls of Mrs. Mac's room. Yes, I think I purposely look for flaws in movies. I'll give it that Billy was in the halls eavesdropping and this is how he was able to gather details vs them being heard through the walls. But why was no one able to hear him? Small detail and there are many possibilities; all of which add to the fun of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little neat story of the Black Christmas House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got to say, Black Christmas is a very creepy film. I love it. It scares you so badly, but unlike most horror films it stays classy by not showing gore (this film doesn't need it anyway). Whats really cool though is I actually went right to the house where it was filmed at. Believe it or not its located right in downtown Toronto. My uncle was at one point friends with the owners of the house, and went right up in the infamous attic. He said some of the things from the movie had been left behind, such as the horse (Mind you this was over twenty years ago). He also said the the killer would had to have been pretty tanked to climb up the wall (He tried and failed I guess. And he was a Canadian champion boxer!). I think its cool because unlike a lot of film locations you can just go there, that is, if you can find it (It really blends in). If i can get the address, I will share it with you, but please remember that it is someone's home and private property, so don't intrude. Also, on Halloween if you look up in the window you might see a dummy with a clear plastic bag on its head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a sorority house during Christmas time, Jessica is getting a few phone calls and they are not warm holiday greetings. The calls are really weird and have little to do with the murders. Bob Clark said that this wasn't a "beach blanket teenager" movie. It's an early slasher movie where the college students are more real. They drink, swear, smoke and have sex. The role of Jessica is played really well. The terror that she displays is extremely well done. In the beginning of the movie, it's from the killers viewpoint and it goes on for quite long. I know what the house looked like after two seconds, they didn't need to show it for five minutes. Other than that, I think that the movie is well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why I've waited so long to see this film because I hear about its greatness all the time, but I saw it for the first time earlier this afternoon. I was pretty blown away at how good it was. I was expecting it to be good but I was also expecting a good amount of cheese because it's so little known. However, it wasn't cheesy at all and it is still terrifying to this very day.I thought the story was incredible. It's really simple but it accomplishes so much and instilled a lot of fear in me. I've heard a lot of people say how Halloween ripped this movie off and I don't see that. I definitely see how Halloween was influenced by this film but that doesn't mean it isn't its own film and a great one at that. I would call them equal films. Both have great stories.The acting was very good and the characters were portrayed very well. The atmosphere is probably the creepiest part about the film, it was executed so well. This is definitely one of my new favorite movies and I am bummed that I waited so long to see it.Every horror fan owes it to themselves to see this movie immediately. It is essential not only to see, but to own as well. And remember, if this movie doesn't make your skin crawl, it's on too tight!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may never have heard of this neglected 1974 gem, but you've probably seen one of its many imitators. Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder (also look for Andrea Martin of SCTV fame) star as two residents of a sorority house that is emptying out as Christmas approaches. The atmosphere is jolly and carefree, except for an ongoing series of menacing telephone calls, and, oh yes, we've just seen someone climb into the attic with apparent ill intent. Kidder does some scene-stealing as the bad girl, Hussey illustrates one of the downsides to having beautiful long '70s hair, and Keir Dullea does a nice turn as the creepy boyfriend. Director Robert Clark knows that the unseen is far scarier than what can be seen and he ratchets up the tension beautifully, making good use of ominous shadows, and putting in nice touches like replacing the sound of a distraught woman's scream with the piercing ring of yet another ominous phone call. This is a terrific, well-made little movie that is genuinely sleep-with-the-lights-on scary. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has one of the creepiest vibes of any slasher type film out there. The killer is almost like a ghost and his imitating of past horrific experiences in the house are frightening. The images of the creepy parents questioning the disturbed boy "Billy" on what he did with his baby sister, "Agnes" are created through phone calls. The audience is well aware that "Billy" is in the house already and making the calls from upstairs to the sorority girls. The characters of the girls, house mother, policemen and Jess' boyfriend, Peter are all well done and believable. The music in this that sounds like the tightening of piano wires is very effective and the one shot towards the end when Jess goes upstairs still gives me chills. A top rate scary movie with some comedic moments that are appropriately placed. This movie is well paced and stylish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beginnings of the slasher genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Halloween, Friday the 13th, and countless other such films there was "Black Christmas." And unless you are a horror film aficionado, you probably had never heard of it.Of course there was the remake, or "reimagining," a year or two ago, which I did not see but did not hear many good things about. After all, a truly good movie doesn't need to be remade, no matter how old it gets.Black Christmas definitely was good enough to stay un-reimagined. It will appear dated to some, but for me this really played in its favor. Older movies often have corny dialog, but it feels more genuine than many modern horror films. Characters that are truly terrified don't constantly make wisecracks or seem otherwise indifferent to their situation.The dark mood of the film was set very early, and was gradually built upon until the finale. It did not rely upon "boo" scares but upon ambiance, situations, and general creepiness to convey the horror.If you want to see the roots of the slasher genre, or are just pining for a unique and excellent horror experience, then Black Christmas won't disappoint. It may be hard to find but is worth a little extra effort. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest slasher of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most strangest, darkest and creepiest thing i have ever seen. To start off with you have the setup with a bunch of sorority girls in a sorority house (kinda obvious). But while they have a little party our unseen killer climbs up into the attic something which at that time would have still been original and i strangely found myself freaked out by this even though it's been done before.Then we have the disturbing phone call by one that the girls have called the moaner, and the call is disturbing and extremely obscene. Then we see the first house girl die and i still don't know who made the noises.Then we have searching for the missing girl when she doesn't show up to meet her father which is worse when we already know she is dead. You then have the usual and some more depressing scenes and death of another. Another depressing thing is when Barb is killed i felt so depressed, i mean Jess is downstairs and if it weren't for the fact that she was listening to carol singers then she would have known sooner to get out of there sooner and also worn Phyllis (not sure of spelling). And when at the end she is told to get out of the house as the calls are coming inside, and she does the exact opposite and goes up the stairs, I just immediately thought that that's it for her, she is going to die. The eye scene had me freaked but not as much as the ending, I just thought so sad for her and what is even worse that the killer still being in the attic, i just didn't sleep for the next two days.This is the greatest movie ever in my opinion and if you haven't seen it and like scary, intense movies then this is perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensational Slasher Fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't ever confuse this with the antagonistically wretched 2006 remake. The original Black Christmas is a masterful, progenitive slasher film that constantly tests my loyalty to John Carpenter's Halloween. Like that latter film, Black Christmas' strength is in its simplicity: a demented killer is making disturbing (and I mean DISTURBING) phone calls to a snowbound Canadian sorority house, sleepily populated by a skeleton crew of Christmas break stragglers. Little do they know, the calls are coming from inside the house.A major trick that elevates the simple plot, however, is that, even though we know from the get go that the calls are coming from inside the sorority house, the film is scant on so many other details that we feel as in the dark and uneasy as the characters. Our interest in the film is sustained throughout because we want to know what happens to these people.That brings me to my next point. Surely odd for a slasher film, the characters in Black Christmas are well-drawn and the performances that fill them are top-notch. Olivia Hussey (one of the most beautiful women to ever grace the screen) and Margot Kidder are, of course, the obvious stand-outs, as the grave and level-headed Jess and drunken, sailor-mouthed Barb respectively. However, there are other remarkable players here, including Marian Waldman in a delightfully hilarious role, genre veteran John Saxon, and Art Hindle, who went on to play a fantastic leading man in David Cronenberg's not-so-fantastic The Brood.Overall, the film is seeping with classic '70s style and atmosphere. Even the minimalist score, with its quiet, brooding sustained notes, reveals a bygone flair for film-making. Lastly, the phone calls the killer makes have to be heard to be believed. If you were scared by Regan's possessed ramblings in The Exorcist, Billy's psychotic shrieks will have you trembling for days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Black Christmas Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Clark, whose life was cut short earlier this year by a freak accident, will always be a genre hero; after all, this is the man who gave us the controversial Vietnam-horror allegory "Deathdream" (1974), the playful Romero homage "Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things" (1972), and the celebrated holiday comedy, "A Christmas Story" (1983). "Black Christmas," a seasonal slasher that predated "Halloween" by 4 years, establishes the formula with grace, subtlety, and skill, threaded with Clark's strong sense of small-town Americana (shots are composed with the biographical artistry of a Norman Rockwell painting). An obscene phone-caller is harassing the girls of a sorority house; one of the girls and the housemother (an inspired comic performance by Marian Waldman) go missing; and our protagonist, Jess (Olivia Hussey) is looking to get an abortion, much to the objection of her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea). Happy holidays, indeed! Roy Moore's screenplay takes a simple premise and lets the layers play out naturally--the collegiate and small-town humor still resonates today, and the characters are played with a minimum of exaggeration (as I said about the Clark-produced "Deranged," we feel like we KNOW these people); my only complaint is that not all of the characters are well-integrated, and some disappear for long stretches at a time. Otherwise, we have some iconic figures that clearly influenced Carpenter's babysitters: Hussey as the Final Girl, Margot Kidder as the hard-drinking joker, and Andrea Martin as the straight- yet-slightly-gawky good girl. The legendary John Saxon is his usual excellent self as the local police captain. And Clark/Cronenberg regular Les Carlson ("Deranged," "A Christmas Story," "Videodrome") has a small role that is the crux of most of the film's suspense (he's the phone-company employee tracking the source of the obscene calls through switchboards as high as the stacks at the Library of Congress). "Black Christmas" is one of the best slashers out there, and certainly one of the most influential (next to "Psycho")--raise some eyebrows at this year's holiday gathering by putting this on right after "A Christmas Story" (and vive la difference!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very chilling horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas is one of the creepiest slasher movies I've seen in a while, for starters this film did make my skin crawl especially with Billy's phone calls. The atmosphere of the house and attic was also creepy, Bob Clark did a good job creating the suspense with the camera shots for the killers POV just like John Carpenter's Halloween, the acting is good from all the cast.The scenes with Billy are intense when he phones the girls because he's reacting his childhood while also saying other things, this slowly lets us understand the character and why he's killing people. I couldn't wait to hear the next phone call from Billy to see what he said next to them because they really are creepy.This film is a real classic 70's horror movie that really sends a chill down your spine. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't until I had rented almost everything there was to rent at my local video store before I decided to take Black Christmas home. The movie was made in 1974 and that alone screams of cheese, right? Wrong! Watching this movie by myself was scary. I was alone and all the Christmas decorations had just been put up, the snow was falling and the house smelt of cinnamon. My movie watching experience was defiantly a good one. Parts of the kill's were very creepy and so were the phone calls. The comedy was hilarious, Marian Waldman made me laugh till I hurt. Margot Kidder was beautiful and witty while I found Olivia Hussey to be a tad over dramatic. Over all I have to say this movie took me by surprise and was very entertaining and well made for its time. Those who pass it by should think twice. Don't miss this Canadian classic. That's right, its Canadian!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when it first came out in 1974. It scared the hell out of me. The worst thing was that my parents knew the owners of the house that the movie was filmed in and I had been there many times before and had many enjoyable visits. We had even spent the night there with no problems. I couldn't believe when I saw the film that it was the same house but my mom's friend told me they moved all of their furniture out and completely remodeled the sections that were used in the movie. After filming was completed the film company put the house back to normal, but the house felt different somehow. It's hard to explain but the atmosphere in the house had changed even my mother noticed it. I went back once and never went again. Even though they had never intended to do this the couple sold the house soon after. My mom's friend always blamed the movie for making her move from the house she loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Slasher film. Still scary and effective 32 years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas easily marked the beginning of the slasher genre heavily influencing films such as Halloween, When a Stranger Calls and Scream. and tons of other films have ripped it off as well. This is probably one of the best horror films ever made with an A list cast, perfect direction from underrated director Bob Clark (Porky's, A Christmas Story, Murder by Decree), Top Nauch Screenplay by Roy Moore, scary cinematography and an even scarier score. PLOT: A group of sorority girls at Christmas time are receiving disturbing creepy phone calls from an unknown person. when one of the girls mysteriously disappears, the girls worry and contact the police who don't take them seriously. when a 13yr old girl turns up dead, the police finally take the girls seriously as more disturbing phone calls happen, among other things. truly a terrifying scary film with one of the best endings for a horror film ever made. I saw an interview with the great Olivia Hussey (Romeo &amp; Juiliette, Jesus of Nazareth, Death on the Nile, etc.) who played heroine Jess Bradford and she said it best. its what you don't see in horror films is whats really scary. the idea of something happening as to opposed to todays horror films that point blankly shove the killer down your throat with gore to boot. not thats bad but not every single film. I my self prefer a scary gory film and this is not gory but boy is it scary. Olivia Hussey, Kier Dulliea (2001 a space Odyssey) and Margot Kidder (Superman, The Amityville Horror) give the best and most effective performances. highly recommended. Im just glad that Bob Clark has finally explained who Agness and Billy are....;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll never look at Christmas the same way again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years I knew little about this forgotten classic. I'd seen the box for it in video stores, with that creepy image of a girl in a chair, head covered tightly by a plastic bag, and a large wreath around the whole image. But for some reason I never rented it and didn't get the urge to until the remake was about to come out and I knew I had to see the original first before even thinking about seeing the new one, so I just slapped down a few bucks and bought it. Sure I could have ended up being one of few who didn't like the film and would have totally wasted my money, but this was not the case. I watched it alone, with the lights off, and fell in love. Now to be honest I still think John Carpenter's 'Halloween,' which came four years later, is even better, but Black Christmas came first and deserves just as much attention if not more.From frame one I was engrossed in it. Unlike a lot of horror films we see today, this one feels very real and like it could actually take place. That is what great horror is all about. The setting, the characters, the villain, and so on, all very real. Having regular, everyday things going on in the background also helps in making this more than just another stalk-and-slash flick. Having been used to gory, no-brainer slasher movies, this was like a breath of fresh air.Pros: Atmospheric direction by director Clark. Plenty of creepiness, especially those phone calls. Well-acted by a then largely unknown cast of actors and actresses. A good sense of humor. A very threatening villain that, thankfully, is kept in the shadows. There's a feeling of dread hanging over the whole film. A subtle, but effective music score and great sound effects work. Moves at a slow, but steady pace. Suspenseful and full of good twists and turns. Beautiful to look at in terms of cinematography and production design. Cons: A bit dated now. Final thoughts: As a horror buff I hate admitting this, but I didn't see this film for years and years. When I heard a remake was on the way I felt I really needed to see the original first, and am glad I finally did. Now I see what everyone was talking about when they said this film paved the way for future slasher films. Sure I love 'Halloween' and it too deserves recognition, but Black Christmas came first. Also, as many others have said, I hope that the remake encourages those who haven't seen the original to check it out.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob Clark's "Black Christmas" is a horror movie masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about Black Christmas and read reviews proclaiming how great Bob Clark's 1974 horror movie was. The movie truly did live up to the hype. Clark creates a creepy atmosphere with Christmas carols and POV shots. Simply put, everything in this movie works: the killer's phone calls are downright chilling; great character development; a few funny moments; shocking ending. There are some images and scenes in this movie that are so well done they will stick with you. The ending is shocking and is the perfect end to this movie. Bob Clark created a masterpiece with Black Christmas, and it is obvious so many "slasher" films took elements from this movie.l If you think Halloween is the greatest "slasher" movie of all time, seeing this lost gem might change your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really creepy little movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little nugget continues to creep the bejesus out of me 32 years after the fact. I remember when I was 10 or 11 and this film first showed up on Home Box Office. My unsuspecting Mom thought it would be okay to watch despite the R rating. I made it through to the first obscene phone call before my Mom chases me out of the room! Up until that point, what I remember scaring me the most was the mood that was already established; my imagination was already filling in the blanks! I don't think it was until recently that I saw the film in it's entirety and other than some rather silly plot holes, the strength of the movie is what it "suggests" rather than delivers! A lot of the violence is inferred in lieu of the gore that has become the industry standard in today's slasher fare. Bob Clark's direction in this movie has become so copied, it was only until recently that I realized he almost single handedly defined the genre of slasher film; The point of view camera angles of the killer, the slow hand held camera shots going around dark corners or behind doors...Clark apparently gave John Carpenter the idea for 'Halloween' which in turn is such an homage of sorts to this movie! It's a true one of a kind classic and real creepfest you'll find yourself trying to avoid...until you need to watch it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Horror Film That Started It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Bob Clark made "Porky's" or "A Christmas Story", he made this lost classic: "Black Christmas". A sorority house is infiltrated by a serial killer who is probably mentally deranged. Being Christmas, the police are overburdened and the girls are drunk. Who can save them? Can they be saved? This film excels at everything. The mood is very good. The casting is great (Olivia Hussey is fantastic, and a young Margot Kidder steals the show). The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. This really lays the groundwork for films to come.And this is what makes "Black Christmas" so great. Besides a foul-mouthed Santa Claus and the feeding of alcohol to children, we have the beginning of some of the most well-known horror clichés. "Halloween" borrows the first person camera angles, and all slashers in general take something from this movie (since, to my knowledge, this was the first movie featuring drunk kids hacked up by an outside intruder)."When A Stranger Calls" borrows heavily, as does "Scream". The horror comedy "Student Bodies" (now very hard to find, and not even on Netflix at all) takes so much from "Black Christmas" it should have made them royalties. In short, once you've seen this horror film you've really seen them all.Some have said the music was noteworthy. Personally, I didn't notice the music -- but I'll just assume that means it fit the mood well. What I did notice was the voice of The Moaner. Films with phantom callers are not unusual, but I don't think any of them do what this film does with the creep. Some strange calls.There is a subplot of a killed girl and of a possible abortion. These story lines never get resolved but work to reinforce the tension in the air. And unlike every other horror film, there is no "Black Christmas 2". I commend them for that choice... will the remakers make the same decision? If you haven't seen this film, see it. You've been eating your hot fudge sundaes without the ice cream, and it's time for that to change.</fullReview>

What may not be so obvious is that the filmmakers apparently couldn't find any suitable Bloodhounds in the Toronto area, so they somehow found their way to my friend's father, who used to raise Black &amp; Tan Coonhounds.Because the dogs actually get a fair bit of screen time in that scene, you can see they're not actually Bloodhounds doing the search. They're my friend's Black &amp; Tan Coonhounds.Just a quirky detail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas is about a deranged killer on the loose in a college town. He takes up residence in the attic of a sorority and picks off the girls one by one. One of the first killer in the attic films, it was scary for the early 70s and is one of my favorites. Many well known actors had their first roles in this film. There are continuity errors and some obvious scene remakes, but overall a good film for the time period. Some masterful camera angles. The dialog was ripe for the time period, but quaint these days. This is one of the few scary PG rated films (except for language) that can get you going. One of the best parts of the film is the calls from the killer and the demented dialog. Very creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let the slick editing of today's music video like productions fool you when it comes to making horror flicks, definitely watch this one and other gems from the 1970's, especially if you want to see the remake then please watch this first. Some may be intentional and some may be coincidence, but there are many horror film conventions that became clichés due to this underrated classic that boasts an attractive cast, good performances, clever editing, slick cinematography and a scary as all hell killer. If you're a horror fan and familiar with the genre flicks from the 70's &amp; 80's, you'll see shades of "Black Christmas" in "Halloween," "When A Stranger Calls" and "Prom Night" to name a few. However, this film is more ambiguous to the killer's identity and what exactly happens at the end, leaving it up to you to decide just what the heck happened. There's not a lot of explanation about anything, which is much better and creepier in my opinion. A must see for true horror and genre fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christmas As Red As Blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Black SPOILERS* Christmas Break; most of the Pi Kappa Sig Sorority girls have already gone back home for the holidays, but a few are still in the house, and begin to receive chilling phone calls by an unknown person, and after Barb (Margot Kidder), a drunkard Sorority Sister, disses him, he says calmly 'I'm going to kill you' and hangs up.One of the girls, Clare (Lynne Griffin) is scared, and mocked by Barb, she decides to go pack, since she's leaving the next day for home with her father, but she is lured by the caller in her closet and suffocated with plastic wrapping, and her corpse is put in the attic (where the killer hides) on a rocking chair, with a doll in her lap.Her father obviously doesn't meet her, and worried (but somehow worried more at the decor his daughter used in her room) he calls the police.And as the Pi Kappa Sig's housemother, the alcoholic Mrs. Mac (Marion Waldman) 'goes missing' also, and the calls become increasingly frightening, the sorority sisters, which include Barb, the pregnant (and planning an abortion) Jess (Olivia Hussey) and the geeky Phyllis (Andrea Martin) begin to realize the danger in which they are in, but is it too late? Not many know of this movie (yet), especially where I live (Italy), where it's rare to find (until Dec. 5, when the DVD is going to come out... I hope), but it's a real treat for horror movie lovers, and it takes you back to a time where Final Girls were still believable, the horror movies were thought out and original (heard that, Michael Bay?), and suspense, not gore, was a priority.The obvious inspirer of 'HalloweeN' (along with Italian thrillers 'Profondo Rosso' (1975) and 'L'Uccello Dalle Piume Di Cristallo', (1970) which also use the technique of the killer's POV), 'BC' conserves intact the power to scare you silly with a very simple storyline and almost no blood.The actors (which other than the above mentioned include Keir Dullea, Art Hindle and John Saxon) are also really great, and there is a subtle sense of humor throughout (just a quote: 'These broads could hump the Leaning Tower of Pisa if they could get to the top of it!'), and let's admit it, Christmas has always been a little *too* cheery, hasn't it? Black Christmas: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh man, this one still creeps me out when I watch it and that's a rarity for me. Canada virtually invented the "slasher"-genre and this one's the proof. The interesting thing about this one is the fairly big name cast of the time: Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder and John Saxon. Someone must have seen this movie when they cast him as the cop/father in "Nightmare on Elm St." Be sure to see Kidder in the hysterical FELATIO-9... scene. I take 1 off out of 10 only because there's no closure (anti-climatic) and it doesn't really explain what the killer's deal is. I can't believe they're remaking it. If you're a true horror connoisseur like me, check the original out first. Though, if you are, I doubt you missed this one. IT IS A CLASSIC!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great slasher film - Sadly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films have a bad reputation for being completely senseless and lacking a sense of artistic integrity. I'm not going to lie, some of them do fall into that category. However, there are moments in cinema history when you get a film that defines the genre. Something that is so good that it transcends the usual trappings that hold films of its kind down. A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, The Exorcist, Alien, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are just a few of the horror gems that are well made and also very scary.The story is quite simple. At a sorority house, the girls are getting ready to go home for Christmas but begin receiving phone calls from a strange caller who won't give his name. The next day, many girls leave, but one who should have met her father doesn't turn up, which causes great concern for her safety. When another girl goes missing, the police begin searching the area and find a body nearby. Meanwhile, with only three students left in the sorority house, the phone calls continue, getting more and more menacing each time, but unknown to the remaining members of the house, the caller, and perhaps the killer, is closer to them than their nightmares could ever imagine.Keep in the mind that the killer calling his victims before he strikes them practically began here. Some might tell you it started with the original When A Stranger Calls, which was actually released a few years later, and it certainly took place before Scream, which was released in 1996. Black Christmas was the first to effectively use this technique and I must say this film uses it the best. While, menacing phone calls can get tiresome in some thrillers, the calls in this film generate fear and tension with each one that is made. They gradually become more violent and disturbing, to the point that they're almost unbearable. This isn't someone merely playing a game, this is someone with deep emotional and mental problems. The phone actually becomes a character itself because for most of the film it's our only link to the killer. We learn very little about him but what we do learn about him is through his acting out on the phone. I guess you can say the phone is an extension of his character.I also liked that this film believe less is more. There is very little blood and most of the violence is implied. Sometimes a visceral approach to horror can work but I think horror is most effective when they leave a lot of it up to the imagination. Your mind certainly creates a more disturbing image then they might've even shown.Speaking of the killer, he's probably one of the better ones to appear in a film of this nature. The most fascinating thing about him is you don't know anything about him throughout the film. The fact that he has randomly chosen to strike these girls makes him all the more frightening because it proves that sometimes crime is unexplained and completely unprovoked. You never really get a clear look at him, since he's merely a voice on the phone or cleverly shrouded in darkness but he's still a very powerful presence. The fact that he's seen rarely makes his few big "appearances" all the more terrifying. I'll provide two pictures of his most frightening exposures in the film and i guarantee when you see it, even after seeing these, those images will still stay with you long after the film is over.Halloween is commonly known for its effective opening scene which a steadycam shot that is supposed to be the perspective of the killer coming upon the house. That technique was made popular in that film but it was used first here and it's actually used often to great effect. The camera is constantly giving you the sense that danger is approaching and it's a very simple but effective technique. A lot of the film is seen from his perspective so it becomes very interesting to view a film through the killer's eyes.No good horror film can work without engaging leads and Black Christmas certainly has a pretty good cast. Olivia Hussy, who at this time was very popular due to her turn as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, is a very likable heroine. She differs from most because she's definitely flawed and is nowhere near perfect but it also makes her all the more human. She's able to carry the film and while she's not the strongest actress around, she certainly handles the task at hand very well. The rest of the sorority girl cast consist of mostly unknowns but Margot Kidder, who would go on to play Lois Lane, is featured as one and quite funny as the booze hound of the house. John Saxon, of A Nightmare on Elm Street fame, appears here as a detective and is always a welcomed presence in anything he's in.Black Christmas is pretty hard to find in stores. I had to get mine on amazon but if you can try to catch this film. It's simple, effective and very scary. It should be given more credit for its role in shaping the slasher genre and maybe with the release of the remake this year, the original will get its much deserved mainstream attention. Check out Black Christmas this Halloween season, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great slasher film, one of the best, but it's no Halloween...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people talk about this film like it is the true unsung hero of the stalker/slasher film genre, even over the well-known and championed Halloween. I do think this is a great film and it does put most slasher films to shame, but it never comes close to honestly beating Halloween in terms of overall product.Some great directing and camera-work, not bad acting, bizarre and manic killer with no motive other than insanity and a few nice twists to keep the viewer interested make this a must-own film if you are a fan of the genre. However, I must insist, this is not quite as good as Halloween. Michael Myers' relentless and emotionless stalking beats the cackling, manic, obscene phone calling killer hands down. Add a superior soundtrack and you have a superior product, in my opinion.I noticed a few people on the IMDb making such audacious comments as: 'Halloween copied/ripped-off Black Christmas'. If I may be frank, that couldn't be more wrong. The only real similarity comes with the camera-work at the beginning of the film. This camera technique employed the pan-a-glide camera and Halloween made much better use of it and the POV shot. I can't put my finger on it and don't know exactly why but there was something distinctly wrong with the shots where we are supposed to be looking through the killer's eyes. In Halloween it felt right, in this film it felt wrong. Perhaps something to do with over-use of the technique. Halloween didn't use it quite as often and didn't have to rely on it quite so much, as it has suspense coming out of its ears from the amazing soundtrack and terrifying on-screen killer. Also, Halloween used more static camera shots watching potential victims, implying Michael Myers was watching but not confirming it, whereas in Black Christmas you KNEW he the killer was watching, because you could hear his breathing and the camera moved around much more. I know this is not the same in the opening sequence of Halloween, but throughout the rest of the film I feel the techniques are superior than Black Christmas.Still, this film IS great and if you do like Halloween, or any films of this genre, I urge you to buy this as it is brilliant.Ultimately, I think the difference is that Black Christmas is the start of the 'slasher' film genre, whereas Halloween was more a 'stalker' film. In Black Christmas, the killer never STALKS his victims. Even the female protagonist when she runs from the killer, isn't really stalked by him as such, as she hardly even runs away until the end of the film. The killer in this film waits for his victims to come to him and the suspense works in this way, where you wait for them to walk into their demise. In Halloween, the killer is actively stalking his victims, following Laurie during the day, going to Laurie's friends houses at night and killing them. So in this respect I guess that if you are more of a fan of the 'killer hiding in the closet' type of movie, this is for you, but if you are more a fan of the stalker type of movie, you will prefer Halloween. Or ask yourself this: what do you find more scary: a killer who you never actually see, even in the final stages of the film, or a silent but deadly shape, who remains off-camera until he strikes, relentlessly stalking his victim for no other reason than that he is pure Evil?But again, I really urge you to watch BOTH! Last note: Female protagonist in this film is FIT. MUCH fitter than Laurie Strode, so that's reason enough why you should watch this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I'm a great fan of all forms of horror flicks "Black Christmas" had, until recently, passed me by. Don't know why but boy was I in for a surprise. I don't know how many thousands of horror films I have seen...but one thing is for sure and that is I am not easily impressed these days but Black Christmas did the job! Yes, we've seen the story before; a group of teenagers stalked by a crazed killer but have this in mind; Black Christmas came BEFORE all Halloweens, Friday The 13th's and Screams and therefore is somewhat of a groundbreaking movie in that sense even though it wasn't first with the hack-and-slash body count formula (check out Mario Bava's Twitch of the Death Nerve from 1971. THAT was early!) Anyway; Black Christmas is a near flawless treat of pure terror with some genuinely creepy and scary scenes including the phone calls from the psycho to his soon-to-be victims. That voice of his...and his crazy psychotic screaming on the phone is maybe the most effective sounds in any horror film ever! This gem is not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A splendidly scary &amp; spooky 70's seasonal slasher landmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made a good four years prior to John Carpenter's phenomenally hair-raising terror movie watershed "Halloween," this superbly scary and suspenseful ahead-of-its-time seasonal slasher trailblazer laid the basic groundwork for the countless similarly plotted holiday-themed horror entries which followed in its influential wake throughout the late 70's and up until the mid 80's.The then fresh and novel, now stale and generic premise centers on a frightfully maniacal cackling lunatic who escapes from an asylum and holes up in the dusty attic of a nearby college sorority house on December 24th. At first the babbling, profanity-screaming nutjob taunts the sorority girls with disturbing obscene phone calls before proceeding to pick off the hapless lasses one at a time. Eventually a token lovely coed (sympathetically played by the astonishingly gorgeous Olivia Hussey) has to face the murderous kook on her own (said only lady left heroine is called in slasher movie parlance "the final girl," which later became a huge cliché in subsequent slice'n'dice features). Director Benjamin "Bob" Clark, who had previously helmed the superior zombie pictures "Deathdream" and "Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things" (Clark's latter efforts include the first two uproariously raunchy "Porky's" films and, amazingly enough, the disarmingly sweet yuletide treat "A Christmas Story"!) masterfully creates and sustains a genuinely eerie and nerve-jangling atmosphere while establishing such standard body count movie components as hand-held subjective camera shots of the killer on the prowl, bravura murder set pieces (suffocation with plastic bag, impalement on hook, and, in the single most stunning kill scene, a comely honey being stabbed to death with a crystal unicorn ornament that's brilliantly inter-cut with an angelic children's choir singing "Sleep in Heavenly Peace" with positively haunting and harrowing results), a creepy mystery wacko whose true identity is never revealed, a few red herring secondary characters (notably Keir Dullea as Hussey's neurotic, violently temperamental pianist boyfriend), a riveting last reel showdown with a brave and resourceful heroine asserting her proto-feminist strength and independence by doing in the killer all by her lonesome, and a socko surprise ending.Cleverly written by Ray Moore, the neatly twisty script further adds several riotous dollops of bawdy humor to leaven the unnerving tension and an intelligent reason why the initial murder victims aren't immediately missed (they left early for the holidays). Reginald Morris' strikingly crisp and agile cinematography vividly captures the stark bleakness of the severely cold wintry landscape, thereby greatly enhancing the overall literally and figuratively chilling mood. The cast all turn in bang-up performances: Margot Kidder vamps it up hilariously as a hysterically brash and slutty tramp, Marion Waldman likewise amuses as the outrageously vulgar den mother, John Saxon is properly stalwart in the first of many concerned police chief parts (a role he reprised to perfection in "A Nightmare on Elm Street"), "The Brood" 's Art Hindle lurks around the edges as a hunky frat boy, David Cronenberg regular Art ("Videodrome," "The Fly") Hindle pops up as a helpful cop, Doug McGrath supplies side-splitting comic relief as a geeky desk sergeant, and a pre-"SCTV" Andrea Martin is engaging as a mousy sorority sister. Smart, absorbing and above all profoundly frightening, "Black Christmas" will most assuredly give you the willies any old time of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the BEST horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas is a very underrated and un-recognised Canadian horror film from director Bob Clarke (probably most known for the raunchy comedy Porkys). This came before Halloween, Friday the 13th, When A Stranger Calls or A Nightmare on Elm Street. This is what started the slasher genre. This created the killer's POV shots, the creepy scores and the obscene phone calls.There really isn't a huge plot here, it is basically about a group of girls in a sorority house are being terrorised by obscene phone calls. No one has any idea who it is calling them. Slowly, each one goes missing and everyone becomes more aware of what is going on.Despite the minimal plot, this is THE slasher film. It has an extremely creepy score that will have the hairs on your neck standing, very effective cinematography (the house is perfect), a great group of younger, great camera work and older actresses/actors and it packs a walloping twist at the end. The lack of gore or violence suits the movie PERFECTLY. If they had shown the killings in full detail, it would not have been as good. One murder (involving a glass unicorn) is the stand-out, being one of the most recognised murder scenes in horror movie history.Many people consider Halloween the original slasher, that is not the case. BLACK Christmas is the ORIGINAL slasher. But it is much more than that. Instead of a cast of complete asses, we have a group of smarter people. They die not because of idiocy, but because of accident or just the wrong place in the wrong time. There is also some great humour tied in. Margot Kidder being the funniest of them all.The movie gives me the chills, especially the ending, which is the greatest in my opinion, of any horror movie. I urge anyone who considers themselves a horror fan to see this.5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start by saying what everyone else has already said about Black Christmas. Imagine its 1974, you haven't seen Halloween, Friday the 13th or Scream. The term "slasher movie" barely exists. Now watch Black Christmas and you'll see just how innovative and scary it was and still is.An unknown figure breaks into the attic of a sorority house as it clears out for the holidays. Amongst those left are; Jess, who is pregnant and wants an abortion and Barb who is a foul-mouthed good-time-girl. Before long, the house mates receive some VERY obscene phone calls (which are virtually the sole reason for its rating). Then, one of the girls disappears...Whilst this may seem generic, it is still pretty groundbreaking by today's standards. Most of the killings are never shown and corpses are never found; the park-search scene is very effective for instance. Characterisation is strong; Jess' abortion and her boyfriend's despair at it is pretty dramatic. The level of humour is unusual, without edging into comedy. The killer himself (who we never see at all) is one of the most frightening characters in cinema; a nut-case who screams wildly, reenacts bizarre domestic situations and has a very disturbing back-story to do with a baby.The script is fresh, the direction is tight and is basically just damn scary. Black Chistmas is arguably my favourite horror film because of these reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little known horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Christmas at a sorority house and there's a killer on the loose. If you think that you've seen it all before, forget it. This is a film on par with "Hallowe'en".The atmosphere is super intense - this is one of the most frightening horror flicks out there. The acting is top-notch, a rarity in the genre. The direction is very well done; Clark keeps you on the edge of the seat from start to finish.And what a finish! There's not a lot of violence here, the body count is lower than any Stallone movie. But each act of violence is chilling, brutal and did I use the word intense? This movie is 30 years old, but it has aged well. If you like Hallowe'en, give Black Christmas a chance.</fullReview>

I concur this film ranks with the best of horror/suspense films out there.But - I will say I have been a fan of the great Canadian Margot Kidder for some time. A brave woman, a class act. This lady has been to hell and back - she is a true survivor in every sense of the word.And Andrea Martin - who would have guessed that SCTV's Edith Prickley would appear in a true blue horror classic? Can you hear Count Floyd howling as he screens 'Black Christmas' on SCTV's 'Monster Chiller Horror Theatre'? LOL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original ending for Black Christmas had the cops leaving the girl with Chris, Claire's boyfriend, in the end, with him saying "Agnes, don't tell them what we've done..." and then he kills her!!... Anyone like this ending better? The director didn't. There is something very creepy about the killer still being there, identity unknown, in the film's ending. It's a shame a re-make is coming. Could this plot actually work in today's high tech atmosphere? Can Hollywood find an original idea? Obviously, NO. So sad. This is what's funny... The 1974 version pre-dates another movie with a similar theme called WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, which of course has it's own teen ready re-make coming out soon. When the new BLACK Christmas comes out people will say they ripped off STRANGER, never realizing that both were 70's films, with Christmas coming 3 years first. I hate that "tweens" get to dictate horror films. It's abysmal. Good googily moogily though, Olivia Hussey was one beautiful woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this movie for Christmas, and watched it for Christmas. i was totally satisfied, and watching it in my uncles bedroom, upstairs in a big house, i got really scared. This movie is really creepy as the P.O.V shots show you what the killer is watching. I mean really creepy.The story centers on 4 sorority sisters, Jess, Barb, Phyllis, and Claire. Also involved in the story is 3 boyfriends, Peter, Chris, and Patrick, a drunker house mother, Mrs.MacHenry, and Lt. Fuller and Sgt. Nash. The girls get obscene phone calls, from a serial killer, who is hiding in their house, killing the girls off.The acting for the most part was wonderful, especially from Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, and Andrea Martin, the 3 main parts. Keir Dullea, John Saxon, Marian Waldman, and Lynne Griffin did good too. This movie blends together a dark frightening atmosphere, p.o.v shots, and some of the most frightening scenes in horror cinema, to create Black Christmas, a frightening horror movie that will keep you guessing from beginning to end, and have you actually be frightened for the characters, who you know are being stalked.Just don't go into watching it expecting a lot of gore, b/c the movie is based on suspense.This movie is definitely worth the $15 plus shipping on amazon.com. I give it hands down a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget Halloween, forget When a Stranger Calls, forget Friday the 13th.Black Christmas is the best slasher film out there, and it will always be that way. Buy a copy of this movie ASAP! I recommend the older copy on DVD. I have noticed over the years of horror movies...that for older movies, a little poorer picture quality has a nice feeling and it adds more character to the movie. In any case, get this film! For anyone who simply enjoys a good horror movie, or if you are making a collection, this is an essential movie to own. I would love to just brag about this movie on and on to you, it is that good! I don't want to give anything away, the whole movie is a real treat.

		<fullReview>OK, I am a big fan of horror, and I love slashers. i have seen so many, and yes like many others I believe the 80s produced the best slashers. I am a gorehound, I love gory movies. I am usually disappointed when there is little gore.I watched Black Christmas about 1 year ago, and it instantly became one of my favorite horror movies. There is little gore, but the film makes up for that.It starts out at a sorority house right before winter break. Some of the girls start disappearing one by one, what they don't know right away though, is that there is a killer in the house, and he has been in there longer than they think This movie is great from start to finish. The "the call is coming from inside the house" originated from this movie. The calls are some of the creepiest, craziest, most lunatic stuff you will ever hear.I would say this is a must see for horror fans, slasher or otherwise. This is one of the earliest slashers, so it is cool to see where films got inspiration from. This is a severely underrated classic, and I seriously think every horror fan should check it out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful horror movie with an absolutely horrific bit of trivia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the best and most unknown horror movies I have ever seen. The atmosphere, the music, the plot, the ending... all of it is absolutely perfect.But what really creeps me out about Black Christmas is the fact that it seems like a blueprint for serial killer Ted Bundy's attack at the Chi Omega sorority house in 1978. Bundy was known for loving slasher movies and he fantasized almost 24/7 about violence against women. In fact, he was once shown the movie Friday the 13th in prison and he couldn't finish it because he got too overstimulated. So it's no stretch of the imagination to think Bundy saw this movie in 1974 and enjoyed every single minute of it.Especially if he was taking notes.So if this movie wasn't creepy enough on its own, just realize it probably served as an inspiration for one of the most notorious serial killings in American history. A lot of the details from Chi Omega are pretty darn close, particularly what happens to Margot Kidder. And if that isn't enough to make your skin crawl, you must be a thicker skinned person than me!</fullReview>

To think that Bob Clark, the director of Baby Geniuses, could compose such a terrifying thriller is astounding. It's sad that everyone gives Halloween the credit as the best slasher film, but this film really is the best, and everyone says that Halloween is genius because of its P.O.V shots, but this film beat by about four years by doing some creepy P.O.V shots and editing. The fact that you always know the killer is in the house plays off well like Hitchcock's theory stated, so I strongly recommend this film to those who really want to watch a classic horror film.</fullReview>

With a decent cast staring Margot superman kidder and John nightmare on elm street Saxon, I found it to be very creepy especially with the Christmas back drop(come on Christmas is creepy)This most scariest thing about the movie is the maniac,with his phone calls to the girls and that he just want to kill for his pleasure.If there's anyone who wants late night scare i would recommend Black Christmas.I also hear there will be a remake of this movie in 2006 which when released should put some focus on the original and receive the credit it truly deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the Christmas Holidays season. Members of a sorority house for young woman receives, what they thought was a obscene phone call and the calls gets seriously disturbing each time. When one of the sorority girls is missing. They become scared and they wonder, what is going on not realizing that the deranged psychopath is in their house.Directed by Bob Clark (Porky 1 &amp; 2, A Christmas Story, Murder by Decree) made a extremely bizarre but original horror film. The film was release a few years before John Carpenter's Halloween was release. Black Christmas and Halloween have some similarities in the storytelling.The latest DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.The new 2006 DVD re-release has new features like new interviews with the cast and crew. The film has a strong cast like Olivia Hussey (Franco Zeffifelli's Romeo and Juliet), Keir Dullea (2001:A Space Odyssey), John Saxon (Enter the Dragon) and Andrea Martin (Cannibal Girls). The film is well made, it's has the right atmosphere and it's quite frightening. One of the best horror films of that era, especially when it doesn't end with the easy way out. Although the real stealing performance is Margot Kidder (The Superman Films) as a Vulgar, Alcoholic Kid with Asthma. Screenplay by Roy Moore. Followed by a remake. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas has been the scariest psycho horror film I have ever seen!This is like an old version of Scream and Urban Legend because the killer is inside the house when he makes these creepy, crude calls.The story begins at a girl's sorority house on Christamas eve when an outsider decided to climb up to a window on the next story and then sneaked into the attic. And then, the creepy, crude calls began.The creepiest moments were when a girl named Claire Harrison decided to pack her stuff and leave the sorority house and suddenly, she could hear someone was in the closet and when she approached it, she was suffocated with plastic and the killer dragged her body through the trap door of the attic. And when morning came, the girls went outside to go look for her, and sitting in the rocking chair next to the camera [ close to the window of the attic] was little Claire with a plastic bag over her head!!! The second one was when Mrs. Quate went throughthe trap door of the attic and before she could do anything else, a hook went through her head! And another was when Barbera ( Jess's friend) was murdered by the killer when he came into her room and got hold of the horn of one of the glass unicorn figures!! And the last one was when Jess thought the killer was arrested and gone, he still lurked in the attic with Mrs. Quate with a hook in her head the cat and strangled Claire Harrison. And then, the telephone rang again.THE COPS NEVER FOUND HIM AND THE OTHER TWO BODIES!!!!!!!!! And Jess and the cops thought that it was her boyfriend Peter who was doing all the murders! To make things sound scary, the killer never shows himself in this motion picture. The only thing we get to see are his light green eyes. And to make things worse, Jess receives calls that came from the upstairs when she doesn't know it. DARN IT! You can hear the victims being strangled, suffocated and murdered!!! You want to know something? Once you watch this movie, you will never want to answer the phone when you have your friends around ever again! IT WILL MAKE YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE IN FEAR!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Margot Kidder is hysterical as Barb; "you can't rape a townie" and Olivia Hussey is more beautiful than Jamie Lee Curtis could ever be. This movie predates Halloween by quite a few years and it really shows that Halloween totally ripped Black Christmas off. Although Halloween is a GREAT horror film - this one is better. Olivia Hussey can scream like hell. The phone calls are really creepy and they really started the whole 'phone-call-in-the-middle-of-the-night' breathing thing. One scene that's really awesome is the one where the killer grabs Olivia Hussey's long flowing black hair as she makes a turn trying to run and throws her.If you're a slasher film fan - this is a must for your collection...lightyears better than Elm Street and Friday the 13th. Too bad there were no sequels. They could have been called Silver Hell, Slay Ride and Silent Night if they're were any...aw well. Of course there's going to be a 2006 remake which I'm sure will be horrible...like the Poseidon Adventure and Charlie and the Chocalate remakes.</fullReview>

Margot Kidder was my favorite because she's always drunk and talking . It was pretty much a given that she was going to die. John Saxon was the father of Nancy in Nightmare on Elm Street. He comes across as a detective. I guess it's his look. Olivia Hussy was in Romeo and Juliet. She's beautiful and there's no denying her great acting.Two, the phone calls alone are scary. They didn't have to use gore or many jump scenes to scare you. The phone calls made my skin crawl, especially when he says, "Just like taking out a wart." You find out he had been listening the whole time or that he might be Hussy's boyfriend.Three, you never find out who the killer is or why he did those things. The bodies in the attic were never found. And you think you got the right killer and that Olivia Hussy is safe but she's probably about to die.Four, the scenes were original. Cellophane, a hook, etc...</fullReview>

The characters were all great, and the killer Billy is one of the creepiest you will ever see!,you don't ever get to see all of his face,and that makes him more effective!. The Phone Calls were especially disturbing,and Olivia Hussey, is absolutely fantastic as the main lead!.The score is very creepy as well,and the ending is very creepy and disturbing (phone keeps ringing). This is one of the best horror and slasher films ever made, and if you love Halloween (like me) your gonna love this movie!. The Direction is amazing!. Bob Clark does an amazing job here, using a very scary,and similar opening to that of Halloween, he also had great camera angles great POV shots, creating a very scary atmosphere,plus he kept the film at a very fast pace!, amazing job!. There is only a tiny bit of blood but this movie didn't need it. We get a few minor bloody stabbings,an ATF slit throat,2 bloody corpses, an ATF head that's been bashed in and that's it. The Acting is phenomenal!. Olivia Hussey is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!, and does an amazing job here, she is extremely likable,very vulnerable,and some people claim she didn't show enough fear i disagree, i thought she did fine, and did an amazing job!,she is one of my favorite actresses. Keir Dullea is very frightening and unstable as Jess's boy friend, he was great!. Margot Kidder is extremely hilarious here, and added some awesome comic relief as the drunk!, i loved her.John Saxon is awesome as usual, as Lt., i wish he had more screen time though. Marian Waldman is also very funny as the drunk i liked her. Andrea Martin, is good as Jess's best friend i liked her lots. James Edmond is okay here, and did what he had to do adequately.Doug McGrath is very funny as the dumb Sgt, although he got on my nerves a couple times. Art Hindle does his job well. Lynne Griffin is good in her screen time.and Bob Clark and Nick Mancuso, are amazing as the voices of Billy!. Overall, GO SEE This movie this instant!, if you can, it's not be missed under any circumstances, one of the best horror and slashers ever made! ***** out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember first seeing this film in the early eighties, i was about six or seven, and horror films have a stronger affect on a child than they do an adult, this film proves it. I was utterly terrified to go to sleep in the dark after Black Christmas, the film's bogeyman is the film's mentality, the audience sees his point of view as he stalks the sorority house where the students are staying and the music is chilling and uncanny, its almost like the killer is an entity rather than a human being, and when he terrorises the girls with obscene phone calls the camera slowly pans over their reactions creating a chilling atmosphere, like the killer's voice is searing into their minds. It's a frightening and scary picture.In January this year though, i bought the film on DVD as a creepy childhood reminder, it has lost none of it's power but now that I'm in my late twenties the effect isn't the same. but i will watch it at least twice every December. A Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My scary recommendation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always recommend "Black Christmas" when acquaintances and I are sitting around talking about the scariest movies. Like everyone said (I knew it before reading other reviews) this came out first and the later "Halloweenish" flicks copied ideas and atmosphere.My dad and two sisters were watching this on TV when we were kids and I remember my dad would try to scare the hell out of us by staging a fake horrified jump and a cry of fear from his prone position, which sent us all jumping! It was called "When a Stranger Calls" (for TV) and they must have cut some of Margot Kidder's lines like "You f***ing CREEP!!!" which she says into the phone with such power and conviction that it makes me crack up whenever I hear it. Yeah, I kinda made a sound bite from of it.I still had to grab a blanket, cover myself and put my feet up on the couch when I saw the video release a few years ago. Of course I only make it worse while watching it in the dark. The only other movie that even comes close in creeping me out is "Omen" when Mrs. Baylock's face appears as she goes after the mother. A 7 out of 10, this movie ranks in my top 5 of the most frightening ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie started it all. it is the best too(along with halloween, tourist trap, and carrie). it is very scary, listen to that phone call about billy. it creeps me out every time. the very first phone call is something you have to try not to laugh at. not because it is stupid or pathetic, by any means, but because of what he is saying. he was like i wanna lick you pretty pink... i don't want to spoil it for you, it is rad. but anyway, there is not much blood, like halloween, but less is more sometimes, ya know. the deaths are VERY scary and... just check it out. anyway, go rent it and have a good time(or buy it, more preferably)oh yeah, there is one actress who looks as great &amp; acts as great as tanya roberts and pamela springstein, and her name is erica leerhsen. yeah, she is new and has only done two horror movies, but the ones she has been in(Texas chainsaw remake and blair witch 2) were very good. so yeah, there are my three favorite actresses( and jamie lee curtis of course.) i'm getting off track though, black Christmas predated halloween by 4 years, and carpenter even borrowed a bit from this movie( though you wouldn't be able to tell, even if you watched them side by side, or whatever). this movie started the slasher genre for the most part and is very atmospheric and creepy. so go watch it, is is well worth your time( it may be the best 1 and a half hours of your life.) it is GREAT! recommendations: freddy vs. jason, uncle sam, jack frost, tourist trap, halloween, carrie, the prowler, there are tons more, just look around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Personal Favourite...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I was a little disappointed, to tell the truth. It was a recommendation, 'My favourite horror movie of all time...the scariest movie I have ever seen.' So I had high hopes. I thought it might even scare me. I watched it with a friend, and by the end we both felt confused, and I was a little angry. The ending seemed almost incomplete. I didn't understand how anyone could end a movie like that. The rest of the movie was great. Good plot, incredible actors, and, although it is not a comedy by any means, there was a good deal of humour. We did enjoy it, to an extent; we walked around for week shouting 'Billy!' randomly; but we just didn't quite get it. Eventually, my curiosity got the better of me, and I had to watch it again. I had to find out what was going on. I thought maybe I had missed something the first time. I didn't. But for some reason, I liked it more than the last time I had seen it. And this rings true for me each time. It just gets better and better. The ending certainly hasn't changed, but I love it now. It's the best and most shockingly unexpected ending I've seen since Sleepaway Camp. This movie has worked it's way into my head, heart, and to the top of my very long list of favourite horror movie. If you've not seen it, then I suggest you get a move on and get your hands on it as soon as possible. (In time) You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I saw this film about four years ago I have been searching for my own copy of it. After many failed attempts to track it down it was released on DVD over here. I saw it on Christmas Eve at about 3 a.m. It didn't have me screaming the house down, but it left me with such a lingering feeling of unease and dread unlike any film I had seen before, that I had to own it. Despite the almost complete lack of blood and gore, despite never really seeing the killer, despite some slightly shaky acting in places, despite a plotline that you've seen billions of times since this film was made, despite ALL that, this ORIGINAL slasher film is my favourite horror film off all time and I have since shown it to as many people as possible, all had the same reaction. I would recommend this film to anyone who really wants to be scared and isn't just looking for buckets of blood and guts. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to say that this is one of best slasher flick's to date. The reason that this movie is so scary, is because you never get the killer's motive. You never even get to see the killer. The mad rambling on the telephone is very creepy. Dont know if you knew this or not, but there was talk of a sequel to this, that would be called Halloween. John Carpenter later asked Bob Clark if he could name his movie Halloween. Great movie.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Killer lurks the attic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here you have a atmospheric thriller of the name Black Christmas. It features several teenaged girls residing in a sorority house with boyfriends abound, and an elusive killer on the loose. Identity of the slayer, virtually unknown, but personality of it, completely insane! It uses telephone callings to the house to both terrify and baffle its imminent victims of its intentions, provided if there is any. One by one the girls fall like flies by the ax of the killer, and the police are without a liable suspect. And even after all is said and done, there is still more that meets the eye as to who the killer was and is. A well thought out suspense film with disturbing set pieces, spooky score and a relative plot twist at the end. Check it out, this movie has spawned countless imitations and created interesting ideas for other hits such as "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th".  Rated **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark holiday, a darker killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christmas is known for the holiday of giving, but in this case it is the holiday for murder, as a loose killer enters a sorority house, hides in the attic and commences disturbing phone calls to the girls downstairs. The voice of the killer is elusive while at the same time quite chilling and unorthodox. Eventually, the killer begins picking off its victims one by one, and everyone is clueless as to who is responsible for these mysterious murders, suspenseful enough?Black Christmas clearly inspired countless clones, and like those worthless imitations, Black Christmas has its flaws and unexplained conclusions. The viewer never discovers the true identity of the killer, and though the motives are not revealed, eerie angle shots and offbeat music is replaced instead. Original? For that time, definitely.Spoilers...Spoilers...SpoilersFollowing one of the murders, the killer phones below and speaks with one of the girls depicting the horror and dismay inflicted upon its victims before their untimely deaths. Then, ambiguity is created as one of the girl's boyfriend closely resembles the killer by shadow, but this is only an illusion employed to hoodwink the viewer. Clever? You bet. Now, during the climax of the film, the girl goes upstairs against the orders of the police to get her sorority sisters until confronted by the killer. This scene is quite spooky, but nonsensical, because the girl was told that the phone calls were within the house, so going any other place in there is a stupid move. A folly on behalf of the director or a purposeful maneuver to show the lack of common sense on the part of the girl. Either way, the scene is set up for the viewer to take a look at the "eye" of the killer, and the vague revealing of its identity as "Billy" the other personality of one of the characters in the movie. The viewer is left trying to decide if the killer is the girl's strange boyfriend because of his lurking about the house, and his shadowing in the background, but it's not him! This is found out at the very end!The multiple voicings of the killer shows the schizophrenic mind of the killer at work, and motiveless reasons behinds its slayings. The killer takes great pleasure in tormenting its victims not only in its head, but also on paper. However, the killer lives on as we all find out with the girl escaping the attack, but lying drug induced in the house. Not very smart there, but the cops must believe the killer's dead, since the boyfriend was slain by the girl in self-defense. The bodies of the victims remain upstairs as entertaining tools for the killer, and adds more schizoids to its already depraved, twisted mind. An open-ending no doubt. Overall, the movie has its moments of dread and suspense via atmosphere and creepy score, but there are clearly loose pieces that are never clarified, unfortunately. Rating **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predating Halloween and it's countless clones in the stalk'n slash genre, I have to say this movie really serves up the goods. Sure, to today's audience it may seem a bit slow and dated but to the true fan, this is a masterpiece of the genre. A madman hides in the attic of a sorority house, telephones the girls from upstairs and eventually starts killing some of them.So many elements have been lifted from this film and utilized to great effect, think of When A Stranger Calls, Halloween, Scream and countless sorority slashers to name a few, this movie has to be termed as somewhat of a groundbreaker. Filmed with a low budget, director Clark relies solely on mood, lighting and atmosphere to give the film it's edge. He succeeds brilliantly. Apart from a rather tedious 10-15 minute segment involving the housekeeper of the sorority the film absolutely keeps it's tension filled grip on the viewer and doesn't let go at all. I even found myself shouting at the tube, telling the girl "don't do this, don't go there", and I can't remember ever doing this before or after. Watching it alone (plus, it was at Christmas time) the film totally freaked me out. Acting is way above average for a slasher flick. Olivia Hussey, besides being a total knockout, is very good in the lead role. Margot "Lois Lane" Kidder is a delight as the foul mouthed drunk, Keir Dullea fairly creepy as Hussey's not-so-sane boyfriend and genre favourite John Saxon is good as always. For the most part, the humour goes down well also. One particularly funny scene involving a not so bright cop, but that seems to be a regular in Clark's films. If you're a fan of horror films, it doesn't get much better than this. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorority girls shouldn't play with mad killers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best known for directing "Porky's", Bob Clark also directed "Porky's II", "Baby Geniuses" and "Baby Geniuses 2". To be fair, he's also the director of a decent zombie film with an excellent title: "Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things". And of course of "Black Christmas", a film that has all good films should have: an inspired screenplay, good actors and excellent camera work.Olivia Hussey is the star of the film. She was mainly cast and admired because of her leading role in Zeffirelli's version of "Romeo And Juliet". "Black Christmas" isn't the weirdest film Hussey is in: you can also spot her in Metzger's "The Cat And The Canary", Kinji Fukasaku's "Fukkatsu no hi" (a.k.a. "Virus") and "Turkey Shoot" (a.k.a. "Blood Camp Thatcher"). You'd almost be more surprised she recently played Mother Teresa. Olivia Hussey is excellent in "Black Christmas" as Jessica (Jess) Bradford, the pregnant and terrorized girl in the sorority house. Don't be put off by the fact that "Black Christmas" takes place in a sorority house: this isn't the sort of film where scantily-clad bimbos are chased by a maniac with a set of knives. The film actually bothered about something called 'plot' and most characters have (at least a little) depth. A welcome change.Also noteworthy is the camera work. The hand-held camera allows us to look through the eyes of the killer, four years before John Carpenter's "Halloween" did the same thing. The cameraman had to climb up and down the occasional stairs, which often looks silly because of a hand-held camera, but "Black Christmas" does an okay job here.Back to the cast: Keir Dullea ("2001: A Space Odyssey" and a handful of cult movies), Margot Kidder ("Superman" and "Sisters") and Art Hindle (best remembered for being in Cronenberg's "The Brood", but also in Clark's "Porky's" films) are just a few actors in a film where most people do at least a decent job. A special mention should be reserved for John Saxon (who starred in more cult films than one could name), who accepted the role of Lt. Fuller when the original actor (Edmond O'Brien) seemed unfit for the role. Saxon flew to Ontario and rushed to the set, just in time for his first scene (in the middle of the night).One might argue why "Black Christmas" needed the subplot of the missing girl, but it's effectively used in a handful of scenes. The naive policeman is there for comic relief, but not the brainless sort of humour one often finds in horror films. If you look at the IMDb message board for "Black Christmas" (but don't do that before you've seen the film) you'll notice the film is vague enough about the identity of the killer, which allows the viewer to guess whether the killer is one of the main characters. So is (s)he? For the answer to that question, I refer you to "Black Christmas", one of the better horror films of the 1970s. Don't expect too much, just sit back and let the film work itself towards an exciting climax and finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Lost Slasher Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 years before "Halloween" forever changed the horror film genre, "Black Christmas" was the original slasher film...and what a weird-ass film it is! There is a killer hiding in the attic of a posh sorority house, a killer whose face we never see and whose motives are never revealed. The film begins almost immediately with the sickest, most obscene phone call ever put on film. It's not so much what the caller has to say (although, for 1974, it's pretty graphic, sickening stuff!) but how he says it; his (or her?) voice changes with every sentence, sometimes two or three voices overlapping each other. It is indeed a chilling thing to hear, reminding me very strongly of Reagan MacNeils Legion of voices in "The Exorcist." The call ends with the mans voice, now speaking in a normal (but no less frightening) baritone, informing Margot Kidder that he is going to kill her. The spree begins almost as soon as the call ends.All of the characters are rather offbeat, and all of them suspect. Olivia Hussey is the surprisingly non-virginal and newly pregnant heroine. Keir Dullea is her moody and slightly obsessive piano playing boyfriend who refuses to allow her to get an abortion. Margot Kidder is the drunk, rude sorority sister with a mouth only slightly less foul than that of the obscene caller, who continues to phone and torment our confused and increasingly frightened Miss Hussey. The girls continue to disappear, but no bodies are ever discovered and no one has any reason to climb up to the attic, where a display of horror awaits. There are some ingenious killings here: a plastic bag, a hook on a rope, the glass horn of a unicorn, all very wince-inducing. The climax obviously went on to inspire "When A Stranger Calls" and can be appreciated anew here.It's not a flawless film, however. I personally hate ambiguous endings. I want to know who did it and why, and although it really is not necessary (real life killings oftentimes have no motive and the killer no history with his victim, after all) it still left me feeling irritated. I also had a serious problem suspending my belief when, at films end, the cops simply leave our heroine alone in the house to sleep her drugged sleep. True enough, they think they have caught the killer...but the girl is in shock, she's just committed a murder of her own (albeit, one of supposed self defense), and I'm supposed to accept it when they turn off the lights and just leave her there? What the hell? Okay, reshoot the last ten minutes or so, and I'll stop griping about the fact that we never find out who the killer is.I'm not sorry I watched it, if that's any consolation to you hopeful horror fans looking for some lost oldies but goodies. It's a good film. It could have been really great, but just fell a few inches short, that's all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Slasher Predating Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD!!!After two competent attempts at horror (Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things, 1972, and Deathdream, 1973), Bob Clarke made Black Christmas, one of the first American Slasher films that mixes the Italian giallo genre and the psycho?on-the-lose cycle initiated by Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). The results were original at the time, but even today, aware of all the clichés attributed to Slasher cinema, the film is still quite chilling.Set in an old dark sorority house during the festive season, a group of girls are brutally murdered by the raving lunatic that resides within the attic (Margot Kidder among them, who also starred in De Palma's Sisters, 1972, then found success as Lois Lane in Superman, 1978). The film even manages to mix horror and humour involving a buffoon excuse for a cop, Margot Kidder and John Saxon's detective character. The red herrings are characterised very well leading you to wonder whether it's Olivia Hussey's eccentric boyfriend (Keir Dullea of 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968) or the ?escaped mental patient' that kidnapped and killed a young girl remains a mystery right up to the tense finale. During the film mechanics are used effectively, especially the now familiar ?caller is inside the house' routine. These are where the scares really lay. The foul-mouthed killer screams abuse at the girls down the telephone, occasionally snorting like a pig and mumbling something incoherent about a boy and girl called ?Angus and Billy'. The film ends with the fact that it is neither, but a deranged maniac who can only presumed to be Billy.The ending was intentionally left ambiguous for a planned sequel. It is even suggested that Bob Clarke, who then chose to do comedy, allowed John Carpenter to pick it up where he left it. As we all know what finally materialised wasn't Black Christmas 2, but the Daddy of the Slasher, Halloween (1978). This is one of the best Slashers, but definitely gets the award for the best psycho killer at Christmas, leading the way ahead of Silent Night, Deadly Night or Don't Open Until Christmas (1984).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent slasher?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this amazing classic horror film yet, do yourself a favor and see it. And remember, before you comment that it is cliche, keep in mind that this came out WAY before all the films that made certain elements of this cliche (killer being in the attic, dead cop outside, etc.). The thing that is very great about this film is that it's not strictly a horror film. There are well developed characters, plenty of comic relief, and some dramatic moments. The characters are not totally worthless and you don't want every one of them to die (except for the boyfriend who's name I can't recall right now, but he's a whiny ass... on purpose of course). The only stupid moronic moment in this is when the girl doesn't listen to the cop and goes upstairs. But they're sorority girls, right? But it's a quite well written script with good twists, a plot that keeps you entertained (unlike Friday the 13th, where you just sit and wait for another murder), knows how to be disturbing without being gory (there is no graphic violence but it's still quite violent and disturbing), and influenced an entire genre (while being better than any other film in that genre, with the possible exception of Maniac, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre if that counts as slasher, and a few others). I don't see how Halloween is THAT much of a rip-off of this. If you're cautious about this movie, thinking it's just going to be the same thing, it's not really. There's a few similar moments, but both films are excellent on their own. 8 1/2 / 10The best scene is the Christmas carol murder scene... brutal stuff! The worst is definitely where the girl goes upstairs when the cop tells her not to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very creepy and it reminded me of Fulci's movie "New York Ripper" in the way that the pycotic caller would call up after he would kill his victims with all kinds of wierd strange noises that sent shivers up your spine. This movie was about a sorority house that becomes victimized during Christmas after an obnoxious prank caller would call up each time he would kill his prey. The only problem with this movie that I have is it does not release the identity of the killer. The boyfriend of one of the tenants had me fooled for awhile but at the end it left me guessing again. And who is Billy? Otherwise... I would highly recomend this one to anybody that likes a good scare, but don't watch it alone, this kind of crazy stuff is something that could happen anywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgotten gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sorority house is menaced by a psychotic killer during the Christmas holidays. Time and countless imitations may have diminished the impact of this 1974 chiller, but "Black Christmas"--along with John Carpenter's "Halloween"--remains the textbook example of how to do a slasher flick right. Director Bob Clark, who went on to direct the much cheerier yuletide classic "A Christmas Story," always knows exactly where to place the camera to maximize suspense, and he uses shadow, music, and an old dark house to extraordinary effect. This forgotten gem also benefits greatly from three believable and likeable lead characters, nicely played by Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the most underrated "slasher" movie of all time...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(****1/2 out of *****) This early mad-killer-in-the-house flick predates "Halloween" (as well as the similar, but much-inferior "When A Stranger Calls"), and it is seriously one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. A group of girls (including hotties Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder and former "SCTV" regular Andrea Martin) staying in their sorority house over the Christmas break are plagued by bizarre, obscene phone calls from a schizophrenic maniac hiding up in the attic who begins knocking them off, one by one. Clark, famous mainly for directing "Porky's" and the much-beloved (and much more family-oriented) holiday movie "A Christmas Story", started his career directing horror movies (he also directed the psychedelic zombie flick "Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"), and he knows how to create an unbearably creepy atmosphere. He builds up so much tension and suspense towards the end of this one that it practically overwhelms you. The freaky phone calls and the disturbing open ending are enough to stay with you for days afterward. Clark and writer Roy Moore also manage to inject some much-needed humor into the oppressively gloomy script, provided mostly by Kidder's profane, heavy-drinking character, Barb. Art Hindle, Keir Dullea (`Dave?' from "2001") and horror movie veteran John Saxon also star in this sorely underrated thriller.HIGHLIGHT: The chilling moment of discovery when the heroine finds out that `the calls are coming from inside the house!' A highly influential horror-movie scene, oft-repeated, never bettered.</fullReview>

The winter setting and the Christmas overtones make for an even creepier atmosphere, and Margot Kidder is great as a bad-mouth, alcoholic asthma victim. Indeed a classic horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before "Scream" ... before "Friday the 13th" ... before "Halloween" ... before "When a Stranger Calls" - there was this!A uniquely creepy (the scene where one victim is stabbed with a glass unicorn is particularly harrowing) movie that seems to be one of the earlier slashers, though in many ways though it has slasher hallmarks, it really is not a slasher; the death scenes are not gruesome and hardly seen, the bodycount is low...A refreshing movie featuring relatively intelligent characters, all the more surprising considering they're sorority sisters, and don't prance around half-naked!! Wow!!Also, some fine moments of serious drama, and a great cast, particularly Olivia Hussey and John Saxon (from horror "A Nightmare on Elm Street" fame).Unfortunately overlooked and underrated, this is a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>vastly underrated? Yes! Fodder for Carpenter? A little bit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I agree there are a very few instances in "Black Xmas" where the influence on Carpenter's "Halloween" can be implied, it's not, however a blue print for Carpenter's more influential(and more brilliant) work in "Halloween". Beyond the first few minutes and some camera work at the end,I find the comparisons coincidental and not easily attributable to either artist to begin with. It's also quite clear that these movies are not even attempting to accomplish the same goals. An example of a film whose tactics and story were clearly "lifted" from this tale would be "When a stranger calls".That having been said, "Black Christmas" IS a fine film. Clark succeeds in establishing a paranoid mood from the start with his very well done hand-held camera work, creepy understated score, clever lightning, and some fine performances. In short, "Black Christmas" is very worth seeing, but leave the comparisons to "Halloween" at the door they're really not as applicable as some would have you believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Very Very Very Frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to put the word 'very' four times in my summary because it was the only way to describe this chilling little film from 1974.The best horrors are the ones that imply horror rather than show it. This film is about a telephone killer who terrorizes a sorority house and kills several young ladies. It is a truly creepy film, a lot creepier than watching some guy with a hood on stalking a load of women with an axe. After all, what's more scary-a knife wielding maniac in front of you who you can at least fight or a mysterious anonymous psycho terrorizing you over the telephone?There are good performances throughout particularly from Margot Kidder and John Saxon and this is a horror I would urge anyone to check out.One more thing-the ending is frightening. The movie was scary throughout but after the film ended I felt a sense of unease. And that is what a good horror movie should be about-scaring the audience to death.If you suffer from a nervous disposition then do watch a little bit of this film but if you are the nervous sort, do not watch the ending. It will scare you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, a warning: Turn on the lights, get the dog, and try to populate the viewing room with as many sane people as possible. The movie starts and you think, s***. Sorority girls? Lois from Superman? An SCTV girl with an afro? WHY OH WHY DID I RENT THIS? But don't worry, you'll be surprised. This is one of the first true "slashers" and it lives up to it's place in that genre. To start the scariness at a minimum, we're introduced to a stranger through creepy creepy phonecalls. We then see through the eyes of some guy with bad asthma climbing the house. He hides in the attic, which in its self is scary! The interesting thing about this movie is that the killings are minimal, and there's no chase scene that I recall, making it unique. There are small problems in it, like while tracing a call from the killer, we see the telephone worker running to manually track the right box by running through hundreds of shelves, and he fails. We see how crazy this killer is, just by how ruthless he is. Then the ending, THE ENDING! That will give you a shudder or two.I know I didn't say much about the plot, but it's basically this: Sorority house, missing girls, creepy boyfriend, suspicious cop, drunken "house mother", missing cat too, and one sonofagun creepy killer hiding in the attic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reminds me of that tale everybody has heard by now. But instead of it being a baby-sitter, it takes place in a co-ed dorm. Somebody who sneaked into the attic by climbing a rose vine (or something like that) and makes obscene phone calls to the kids. one by one the kids get killed off. The people who are alive just think the kids are missing. Why somebody would stay in a dorm all Christmas holiday instead of going home is beyond me. This is a good movie considering it was made in 1974. One year older than me. After reading all these comments want me to watch the movie again.(considering i didn't know who Kidder was back then). The only problem is that it's very hard to find these days.</fullReview>

The fact that this effectively invented the formula that Halloween made popular four years later is really quite impressive. Although I have to say that the actions of the cops at the end are suspiciously negligent. (Leaving the victim alone in the house? Come on, was Chief Wiggum in charge or something?)If you ignore this it makes for an effective final punch. Try to see it one Christmas night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Black Christmas" in my opinion should be up there with such classics as "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th". But as it turned out it isn't. When I first viewed this film in early 2001 I didn't think it would be as good as I was told. The film mesmerizing.The way the film was shot was so original but is copied by later horror films like "Halloween". The plot of the story was good and was scary but is copied later. The film is largely overlooked as a horror film but it is worth the watch. Olivia Hussey"s performance is way better than the over the top Jamie Lee Curtis who unlike Olivia can't live up to her beauty and elegance of the role. Even though they are two different characters you can tell which one is copying who.The terrifying conclusion is well worth the wait and is a thrill ride you won't soon forget. So take 98 minutes of your time and let your skin crawl because "Its me billy agnus"....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Bob Clark directed slasher predates Halloween by four years and clearly had a major influence on Carpenter's film. I dare say, that Black Christmas is even bleaker and more frightening than Halloween. The killer here is a raving lunatic as evidenced by his very disturbing and obscene phone calls to the sorority girls. Clark scores big with great POV shots, which reminded me of Italian giallos, and a very effective ending. He also uses humorous elements to offset some of the genuine tension. Go see it, if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Want To Be Scared?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Small *SPOILERS* ahead. This is the Grandaddy of "Put down the phone and walk out of the house, now" films. If you really want a good scare then this is the one for you. Made in Canada, it pre-dates all those "phone call from a mad killer" movies and sets the standard which those films that followed really never matched. (The one exception being "Halloween"). The setting is a sorority house on a college campus at Christmas holidays. The terror and murder that is visited on those girls that are still left in the house is unrelenting. The story is basically a simple one.....horrible phone calls which result in horrible deaths. That voice on the phone will totally unnerve you...it lingers with you long after you have seen the film. Margot Kidder is perfect as a hard drinking, hard edged student and Olivia Hussey is truly beautiful as the gentle girl in love with Keir Dullea. In fact the whole cast, some of whom are unknown to American viewers, is quite good. Look for Andrea Martin from "Second City" as one of the sorority girls. The downbeat ending will leave you weak, as will the scenes with Hussey and Dullea when she rushes to the basement to escape. Why do people always go to the basement instead of leaving the house? If you like films that scare the bejeesus out of you, then don't miss this one. It is available on tape but don't watch it alone, and for God's sake, don't answer the phone!!!</fullReview>

Can you imagine a more scarier place for someone seeking refuge in an upstairs attic. . .during Christmas time? Please, even that thought starts to make me feel paranoid.Olivia Hussey (beautiful as ever) delivers a very convincing performance. Vivid appearance from Margot Kidder as the hard drinking Barb (sexually explicit jokes aplenty) and John Saxon as resourceful as always as Lt. Fuller. Bob Clarke shouldn't beat himself considering the fact that the ending was left to an unanswered scenario, who cares it's gem.

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest slashers films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say that I am a huge horror movie fan. I thought I had seen just about everything when I heard about this little film from the early 70's. I will say I went into it with big expectations after reading so many positive reviews from the internet, and I wasn't disappointed.I won't dive into a description of the plot, you just need to see it if you haven't already. I will say that this film is not only a great film, but one that possesses many of the slasher standards that are so predominant in those movies today, and it pre-dates almost all of them. While I won't say this film is the first horror movie to the killer P.O.V. shot, it is, along with Dario Argento's "Deep Red" (made the same year), one of the first to do it very, very effectively. And you'll see where countless others like, "When A Stranger Calls" and "House on Sorroity Row" lift many ideas, just to name a few.The director, Bob Clark, who is better known for his comedies of the 80's (Porky's, A Christmas Story) more than his horror movies of the 70's, is excellent in creating very human characters, a creepy atmosphere, and a very good story line, without generating terrible dialogue. And let's not forget the very scary killer. If you can find it on Ebay, I recommend one of his first horror films, "Deathdream" (a.k.a. "The Night Andy Came Home"). Very rare and very small budget, it is another example of why I wish Clark would have directed other horror films throughout his career. Also look for collaborations with writer/director Alan Ormsby on "Deranged" (1974) and "Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things" (1972).See this movie. It is available on DVD. And thankfully, "Black Christmas 2" is finally in production. Grade A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas is considerably tame compared to most of the films in the slasher genre. Instead it relies on pure scare tactics and the fact than a horror film does not have to be extremely violent and gory to be genuinely scary.Featuring a great ensemble cast including John Saxon (From Dusk Till Dawn) , Margot Kidder (Superman films) , Keir Dullea (2001: A Space Odyssey) , Olivia Hussey (Romeo and Juliet) and Art Hindle (Porky's films).Great use of P.O.V. camerawork and (relatively new at the time) steady camerawork.The story is quite simple: It is Christmas break and most of the students at a university have gone home for the holidays. The few that have decided to hang around campus over the holiday break are harrased by an obscene caller with a menacing voice who slowly picks them off one by one. Directed By Bob Clark (Porky's films , Murder by Decree) , a fine filmmaker who mostly directs comedies and horror films , with a screenplay by Roy Moore (The Last Chase) is sure to satisfy any horror film lover.Check out "Murder by Decree"(1979) : a great Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper thriller featuring Christopher Plummer , John Gielgud , Donald Sutherland , David Hemmings , James Mason and Geoffrey Russell</fullReview>

Too bad no one has heard of it because it really deserves recognition. The cast is fantastic and includes Olivia Hussey(Romeo and Juliet),John Saxon(A Nightmare on Elm Street 1,3,and 7),Keir Dullea(2001), and Margot Kidder(Superman) KIdder steals the movie!!!

		<fullReview>Okay there have been some great horror films but BLACK CHRISTMAS makes my Top 5 list. It clearly is terrifying from start to finish. Even the trailer gives me the creeps. I'm not going to tell you the plot the Db already has it but I would really like to recommend this to anyone looking for a great horror film. The lighting is perfect the fact that the killer's face is never seen until the end, (but wait is she/he really the killer???) The acting is great and it has a fine cast for a slasher film, people who's fame really kicked in, or already had like Keir Dullea from Kubrick's 2001 which was prior to this. He was in his early 30s playing a kid in his early 20s. Margot's cocky and obnoxious sorority girl is great too. But the most unsettling thing about this film (in a good way) would have to be the creepy phone calls. So go rent this film you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure by now that everyone has heard how good this movie is, and they have heard right. This is one of the best early slasher films out there, if not THE best.The thing that makes this film so great is the fact that it came before them all and was the first slasher film to use all of the conventions we know so well. In the opening, we watch through the eyes of the killer as he circles a house where a group of sorority girls are having a party. We heard his heavy breathing as he climbs up the trellis of the house and enters through the attic, events we have seen countless times afterward. Thus begins the film, which captivated me from that one scene and didn't make me lose my interest until the powerful finale. From the first phone call immediately following that scene, to the killer's heavy voice at the end as a shot of the house is shown, this is a stylish and suspenseful film. As usual, lovely Olivia Hussey delivers a wonderful performance and so does Margot Kidder as a foul mouthed and drunken sorority sister. One by one the sisters are stalked by the psychopath and he could be just about anyone. Hussey even begins to suspect that her boyfriend has something to do with the murders, but as the audience knows, the suspects never end up being killers. Full of weird and frightening phone calls, some great performances and clever dialogue, this is thrilling and truly original horror film, one of the first of it's kind, which makes it better than ever. This has been an obvious inspiration for numerous slashers out there, including Halloween, which was originally planned as a sequel to this film. This is a masterpiece of tension and a truly horrifying experience. The unconventional ending is also a plus and a very unexpected way to end the film. Turn off the lights, grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy. This is a definite must see...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply one of the best -- and most underrated -- horror movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliant work of terror and suspense which predates Halloween. It's the simplest of stories: a psychopath holes away in a sorority house attic and makes shockingly obscene and bizarre phonecalls to the unwitting housemates, who he proceeds to knock off one by one. Sound like old hat? SEE THE MOVIE. This film understands that what we HEAR is scarier than what we SEE -- and what is hidden is more terrifying than what is revealed. The sick phone calls, in which the killer assumes about a half dozen personalities (crying baby, nagging mother, twisted sexual deviant, scared little boy, abusive father, calm killer) compose the most frightening soundtrack since The Exorcist. No other horror movie since has utilized sound so effectively. Only, perhaps, The Blair Witch Project, with its use of a baby crying, demonstrated at least a partial understanding of how a single simple poignant sound effect is all you need to scare the silly putty out of the audience. But Blair Witch is nothin' compared to "Black Christmas." This movie was originally called "Stranger in the House" when I saw it as a kid. But you can now buy the special edition DVD under the title "Black Christmas." It's a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi everyone....i had no idea Black Christmas was so popular! My grandmother owned that house until 1994. As you see i wasn't even alive when the movie was filmed, my mom was and the stories are pretty funny. The film crew left this huge Black Christmas promotion in one of the rooms. Fast forward some years and now i'm in the picture. I would stay at my grandmother's house a couple nights a week in the room where the girl gets suffocated and stuffed in the closet. I hadn't seen the movie yet 'cuz i was still young so it didn't bother me. But one day my cousins (who lived in the house) rented it and i happened to see it. Holy S***! Sleeping in that room was never the same! Jesus, being in that house when i was seven years old used to scare the hell outta me! Anyways, i just thought i'd share my lone story of Black Christmas. I was stoked to see so many people liked it.Cheers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why can't they make films like this anymore?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read several of the comments regarding this film and how it was so influential on many slasher films made since, I was expecting an outstanding thriller. I must say I was not disappointed. This was an actual scary movie! The refreshing thing about this movie was it did not use extremely gory special effects or cheap sex scenes (although sexual innuendos are littered throughout the film).Aside from being a little dated (the 70's fashion was rampant) this film has really held up over time. Having seen most (if not all) of the films referred to in the previous comments as having "ripped off" Black Christmas, it is obvious this film was indeed used as a blueprint for several of the "slasher" movies that followed.*** The following commentary contains SPOILERS ***Having said that I do disagree, however, with several comments made that John Carpenter's "Halloween" was a blatant ripoff of this movie. Aside from a homicidal killer who murders girls during a holiday, I did not see a lot of similarities. Granted the victims were killed in similar methods (stabbing or strangulation) but let's be honest - except in the numerous Friday the 13th movies where each sequel featured new and exciting ways to kill people (everything from hedge clippers to spear guns), there aren't that many ways a psychopath uses to kill someone in a slasher film (and stabbing and strangulation are pretty common). But I didn't see Michael Myers playing with any of the victims long after they were dead (as the killer in this film did with Claire, the first victim, who he rocked in a chair from time to time). I don't recall Michael Myers making repeated and lengthy obscene phone calls to his victims before he killed them. In Halloween, there was no question of who the killer was at the end. I didn't see the killer in Black Christmas wear a mask, steal his dead sister's headstone, or escape from an insane asylum. So where, exactly, does the "blatant ripoff" occur?Slasher films all have a basic premise (psycho killer for various reasons stalk and kill helpless victims who may or may not have been a part of the killer's past) so you can pick any two films out of the slasher genre and draw similarities. Granted "Black Christmas" was one of the first films in this genre and, as I mentioned earlier, there are remarkable resemblances between this film and others (most notably the opening scene of "When a Stranger Calls"). But I would hesitate to say any one slasher film was a "blatant ripoff" of another. Even the original "Friday the 13th" had enough differences from "Halloween" to avoid the "blatant ripoff" stigma.The Bottom Line: Black Christmas is a very good and effective thriller with an undeniable influence on the entire slasher genre that followed it. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good tingle of the spine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have seen this classic more often than any other film in my life. i ran the college film program and this was the number one most popular film shown. i saw this movie 7 times in the course of three days and loved every minute of it. i have seen about every horror/slasher film ever made and this is still #1. margot kidder gives a brilliant performance as barb-from the moment she tells her mom that she's a gold plated whore after being dumped at xmas she takes the film by the balls and runs away with it. and the phone calls...what can i say, if you watch it again and really listen to what seems like raving lunacy the first time, the calls actually tell the back story of the killer and perhaps why he came to that house to kill. and its thrillingly directed, and the ending will chill your bones. and john carpenter and everyone else ripped this film off and it should be watched again and again and release it on dvd damn it!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most frightening slasher movies EVER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled across this at a local video store, and read the tagline, "If this movie doesn't make your skin crawl, then it's on too tight!". It looked frightening, so I picked it up and rented it. Went home, turned off all the lights (I was alone in the house too) and watched this film. I'll tell you honestly, I couldn't sleep after I finished watching this movie. I was so incredibly scared by this film. Sometimes, it even scared me more than "Halloween" did. Plus, there is a good mystery to this film because we don't really know who the killer is. It starts out with introducing to us several girls living in a sorority house during their Christmas Break. We are also aware that a psycho killer is lurking outside the house, and makes his way in through a window in the attic. Soon, he begins his reign of terror which includes threatening phone calls (oh god, I was freaking out during those scenes!)...and murderous attacks on the girls. There isn't a lot of blood or nudity, but this film is so incredibly frightening and scary and pumped with atmosphere, every horror fan should love it. Let's not forget that creepy piano score and the lovely girls, Olivia Hussey as beautiful heroine Jess (man, that girl can scream!!!), Margot Kidder (who does a hilarious job as Barb, an alcoholic chain smoker), and there is also Lynne Griffin (who was in "Curtains") and Andrea Martin ("Cannibal Girls"). This is an absolutely awesome movie! Rent it! Buy it! Cherish it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently watched the 25th anniversary edition of Black Christmas and realized that after seeing it again all these years later that it still sends chills down my spine. This movie was made three years before "Hallowe'en" and is even more exciting than it's more famous counterpart.The young cast of Margot Kidder, Keir Dullea and Olivia Hussey are terrific as a group of students terrorized on campus by a mysterious killer. Although this has been done to death nowadays by "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and all of the other slasher films, none of them come close to having the impact of this one. The ending guarantees that you will not soon forget "Black Christmas".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film practically invented the "slasher" genre, and it is better than most films that fit that category. It can make you laugh one minute (the sorority housemother is a riot!), then send chills down your spine (that voice on the phone is just plain creepy), the next. Often copied, but almost never duplicated. It is an original, and anyone who enjoys horror films must see it. Be warned, even after all these years, the first telephone call from the mysterious stranger, is a shocker!

Olivia Hussey(of ROMEO AND JULIET fame) is excellent as the tormented young woman who fears that the killer maybe her violent-tempered boyfriend(Keir Dullea) who doesn't want her to abort their baby. Margot Kidder is a standout as a drunken, consistently trashed sorority sister with asthma. Directed by Bob Clark(A CHRISTMAS STORY), the film is surprisingly bloodless and concentrates instead on creepy, ominous atmosphere, and genuine suspense. This was several years before HALLOWEEN or FRIDAY THE 13th, and in my opinion, much better!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, Black Christmas is a very good horror movie. I prefer Halloween but, that isn't saying Black Christmas is a total washout. It was also the first to use the telephone as a scare tactic, as far as I can remember. There are some genuine scares, especially at the end, and a good feeling of dread in the film. In Deathdream, Bob Clark showed he can direct a horror film and here he is given a budget and better actors. Hussey and Dullea are very good, but Kidder is excellent as a foul-mouthed alcoholic. Good foot note= It was pulled once from an NBC showing for being too frightening.</fullReview>

The thing that was the most frightening about this movie to me was how the killer accessed the house from the attic - a hole in the ceiling. I had this same type of attic opening IN MY ROOM! Whatever critters that lived up there kept me awake many a night wondering if there was a psycho killer in my attic just waiting for me to go to sleep so he could kill me. I also thought the way in which Margot Kidder's character bought it was spectacular! I've only seen this movie twice - the first time was 15 years ago and the second was 10. I know that I am a more experienced horror watcher now and this movie might not scare me as much as it did when I was 15 (after reading all these comments I have a nostalgic yearning to see it again soon) but I will always get a delicious chill down my spine when I remember the attic opening in the ceiling.</fullReview>

I despise Scream and everything that is supposed to pass for horror these days.Anyway, back to Black Christmas. This movie freaked me out more than anything I've ever witnessed. From "Agnes...it's me, Billy" to "Just like having a wart removed" I have never been affected by a movie so much in my life.

		<fullReview>Black Christmas was and still is my all time favorite movie, or at least as far as horror flicks go. But this movie isn't the traditional gore fest like this movies followers, Halloween and Friday the 13th. This is more of a creepy, mystery type film. Taking place in the Christmas season, a handful of college girl get picked off one by one curtious of a ranting lunatic who calls the house, yelling and screaming the most disgusting, horrible, body tingling things, followed by a death threat. Taking the police's help, they bug the phone and trace the call. The most hair-standing moments are when the last survivor of the bunch learns that the calls are coming from inside the house, stupidly goes in search of the killer, and after finding dead bodies, hears the psycho ranting once more behind the door and can see the man's evil wide eye peering through the crack of the door. I won't reveal the ending, but it will scare the hell out of you. This movie proves that you don't need tons of gore to pull of a scary film. My advice: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE AT NIGHT, WHILE ALONE IN YOUR HOME!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent film which combines good acting and an interesting plot, which it seems is very unusual in the horror genre. It's Christmas and as the girls prepare to leave their sorority house they are plagued by harassing phone calls. Soon the calls lead to murder as an intruder breaks into the house and starts killing off the girls who have not yet left. Now its a quest to find the killer before everyone is dead. Margot Kidder gives a wonderful, hilarious performance as the perpetually drunken sorority member. And Olivia Hussey is worth seeing as well for her solid performance. One major thing that should be noted is that this movie preceded Halloween by a good four years, and it seems obvious now how that movie was influenced by this one. Further, unlike later horror movies, the heroine isn't a near saint, rather she is just as imperfect as the other characters. Overall this movie works on many different levels and should definitely be seen by fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONE OF THE GREATEST!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas is one of the greatest horror movies of all time. It builds up a scary atmosphere not only blood and gore like other movies. (Friday The 13th) Imagine getting phone calls and on the other end someone is using three or four voices, their comments are sexual in nature, they are filled with profanity and they say I'm going to kill you. (ring a bell, SCREAM) The phone calls are very strange and bizzare and just listening to them gives you the chills (the calls are coming from inside the house). There is also a bit of a who done it, you think you know who it is and then there is a twist. There is violence like all good horror movies, but not too much, there a funny scenes. I especially liked the directing of the scenes with the killer. We don't see the killer but we move with his eyes, and we hear him panting, puffing, and making strange noises. Phone calls were excellent, with the weirdest noises coming from the killer. great performance by the actors. This movie was made before a lot of the other horror movies and many have tried to copy it greatness but failed. WATCH IT!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A creepy tonic to Christmas cheer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent horror film, which manages to build up a quiet, considerable power. While it may not be out-and-out BOO! YIKES! scary (very little is these days), it combines narrative and subtext to an agreeably creepy pitch. Imagine an episode of THE X-FILES without the gloss, or alien nonsense, or enervating conspiracy theories, or even Mulder and Scully. Even the amusing accents (the film is Canadian) cease to grate after a while.The story is set in a placid all-girl sorority house on campus in some Canadian university, at Christmas time. The girls are having a sedate party with some boy friends. Outside a breathing camera lurches towards the house... Like Argento's SUSPIRIA, this all-female community is the site of the most horrific repressions, anxieties, fears, waiting to burst out, both within (figured as alcoholism, unwanted pregnancy) and without (rapes, murders, obscene phone calls). Cleverly, though, the girls don't go hysterically loopy - everything remains externalised - much more chilling, even if it lacks the full on psychogynaecology of the Italian masterpiece.For example, one girl's mother is clearly indifferent to her, gold-digging, she claims, after other men. Another is a virgin who has previously, we deduce, lived in a very repressive, rigid family atmosphere. Indeed, one of the noteworthy things about BLACK is how these girls are away from home for the first time - they have cut away from authority, patriarchy and tradition. The film is not necessarily a reactionary plea, however - the girls' substitute authority figures - boyfriends - become the locus of the terror; and although their self-made family verges on the parodic (with their seemingly jovial, frustrated alcoholic housekeeper as mother substitute), it is a genuine, if finally useless, structure of support.I suppose the film could be seen as an examination of the deep traumas buried underneath the vociferous self-confidence of contemporary feminism - after all, it was directed by the man who would make that radical treatise on gender relations, PORKY'S. The main plot centres on the lead's right to have an abortion, and the terrifying phone calls - a horrifying, babbling cacophony from the beyond - seem like the pleas of a dying child, or the malicious threats of an Id-mother. The idea of the disembodied or unreferential voice (those things denied a presence in the film, and maybe our society; e.g. the psychological trauma of abortion), miscommunication, misread signs, disinformation all suggest a culture where all recognisable meaning has gone haywire. As this is the film's anxiety, we may feel that it is somewhat right-wing.On the other hand, it's thematic interest is the family, set in a family away from a 'real' family. The BLACK of the title in relation to CHRISTMAS suggests diabolical overtones, a distorted mirror of the Holy Family celebrated at this time. Maybe the film is reactionary - charging newly independent women with destroying the structures of family and tradition, and unloosing untold terrors and demons.Or maybe it's very sympathetic to the characters' plight. Patriarchy in all its forms pervade the film - the unseen killer/rapist; the ineffectual police lieutenant; the self-obsessed boyfriends; the downright idiotic cop. The only clever, likable characters are the women. And, as in the case of Barb, their rejection of family is not necessarily willed. The path to independence is certainly not made easy in this culture.The great thing about BLACK is how it shows the sheer ineffectuality of trying to specify the unspecifiable. It is obviously madness to think that Peter could have committed all these crimes, and yet it is quite reasonable to demonise him - he reveals the monster beneath the sensitive New Man. The heroine discovers that she can rely on no-one but herself. Even this isn't enough. Notwithstanding the unreassuring ending, she still has to deal with the fallout of her actions, which are by no means resolved. There is still the issue of the abortion, which is one reason the demon is not dead. There were obscene phone calls and rapes before she knew she was pregnant: the fears may be subjective, but the inability to connect everything makes the film the more scarily effective.As a horror film, BLACK's excellence derives from the disparity between the hysteria of the subject matter, and the cool film style, suggestive, sinister, yet withdrawn. The breathy point of view camerawork may seem tiresome after HALLOWEEN and its dozy imitators, but here the idea of something submerged, concealed, unknowable, unconquerable, not even human, never mind the cartoon slasher we're used to, is superbly realised, slowing down time. The images of the first dead girl, with the doll baby in her lap, and the cat purring beside her, will haunt me for a long, long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie after much searching through Mom &amp; Pop video stores and found a pristine copy. It scared my pants off! BLACK CHRISTMAS is one of those movies that is an unsung classic and is most appreciated by horror buffs. I tried to get my friends to watch it, but they are all into gory, graphic horror opuses like SCREAM and URBAN LEGEND. Unfortunately, those movies have very few scares and are just cheap rip-offs posing as tributes to great films like this one. There really isn't anything to complain about for this movie unless you don't like movies that rely on suspense and hinted-at violence.One reviewer said this movie wasn't a slasher movie because BLACK CHRISTMAS wasn't gory enough. The gore in slasher movies is what ruined the entire horror genre. BLACK CHRISTMAS, HALLOWEEN, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, the older films rely on suspense, mind-numbing suspense and require your imagination. People are spoiled by the gore effects in films now, sometimes the effects are gratuitous and don't move the story along at all! BLACK CHRISTMAS' story moves along briskly, dragging the viewer into it, making the movie seem so real! Horror buffs should appreciate the fact that BLACK CHRISTMAS attempts to "befriend" its audience instead of "ripping its guts out"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first and best slasher flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may argue that Psycho was the first and best slasher flick, but you'd be wrong. Psycho's events took place in an isolated area, and so it is disqualified from the slasher genre, however, Black Christmas was the first film to bring terror to suburbia. Girls in a sorority house (including Romeo and Juliet's Olivia Hussey and Superman's Margot Kidder) are victimised by a prank caller, and then those within their number start to go missing. Definitely the scariest parts of the film are the parts where the police make Olivia Hussey listen to the demented ramblings of the phantom caller. Although John Carpenter's Halloween was acclaimed as the first slasher pic, this film was made four years before Halloween, and contains many of the elements that seem so 'original' in Halloween (such as the killer's first person perspective, and its almost omniscient characteristics). It is a crying shame that this movie never got the success (nor the critical acclaim) that is so well deserves. It certainly ought to go down in history as the definitive stalk 'n' slash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly one of the best horror films ever made! It had both thrills and good laughs-especially from Margot Kidder's character. How this film hasn't gotten the recognition that it deserves, I don't know. I bought it last year, and recently watched it again. It gets more and more worth every penny each time I watch it. I would do ANYTHING do see it released on DVD. I would run a hundred miles to see it on DVD. If two films who heavily "borrowed" from it can get on DVD(Halloween, When A Stranger Calls), why can't this? Warner Brothers, you haven't had a hit in a long time. This is a classic, and more than deserves the DVD treatment. This is stuck in your vaults, and should be let out. If not for the fans that have already started a following, then what about the future fans? What about the teens who think quality horror is a bunch of people stripping down and dying extremely bloody deaths? This is a BRILLIANT film(and I hardly use that term) that uses hardly any blood, and no nudity-yet it has a stronger effect. Now that I am off topic, I will stop typing.

		<fullReview>Many offer Halloween as the classic against which all stalker movies should be compared, but four years earlier, Black Christmas, a minor but exemplary effort succeeded in being far creepier, and avoided many of the former's failings. The telephone scenes are unnerving, the killer truly scary, and the ending is superlative, with a terrifying coda. It strains credulity sometimes, but the terrific use of setting, especially the snowbound Canadian campus, and the admirable character development (so it's not Anna Karenina; how many horror films actually give attention to the minor characters?) make for a highly recommended, as well as historically important, terror film. Olivia Hussey gives a standout performance, Margot Kidder steals her scenes, and Andrea Martin makes an impact in a non-comedic role. Definitely outshines its knockoffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Early Example Of The "Slasher" Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be an exaggeration to suggest that "Black Christmas" gave birth to the slasher genre. It is, however, without any doubt one of the best of the early examples of the genre, and it's very obvious that it provided at least some inspiration to what I would still consider to be the absolute best of the genre - John Carpenter's "Halloween" which came out a few years later. Carpenter (at least in his first Halloween film) learned a lesson from "Black Christmas" that a lot of later slasher films forgot - the "horror" isn't in blood and gore and overly and unnecessarily graphic violence, and you don't need naked young women to keep people watching! There are no naked young women in this (although there's sexual content in the phone calls) and "Black Christmas" actually contains surprisingly little blood and gore. Really there's only one scene - the only murder that's actually depicted, and certainly by modern standards it's not particularly graphic. The film creates its horror and suspense through the use of atmosphere and setting - and by letting the viewers in on what's happening from the start. We may not know who the killer is, but we know that the killer is in the house - which makes this all the more suspenseful, because at literally any moment of any scene set in the house, something could happen. That really very little does happen only heightens the expectation.The story revolves around a sorority house just before Christmas. As the movie opens, while a party is going on inside, a stranger (whom we never see) climbs the side of the house and gets into the attic. We're than introduced to the fact that the girls in the house have been getting a series of creepy obscene phone calls. The story builds from there as the first girl is killed, and while it takes a while for anyone else to die, that sets the stage for a truly creepy movie watching experience. The ambiguous open ending also provided obvious inspiration for later similar films that left similar open and ambiguous endings, but perhaps kept returning to the well too often.The cast is pretty decent. Apparently the producers tried to recruit some pretty big name people for this (I understand, for example, that Bette Davis was approached to play the role of the house mother) but couldn't get them. In the end, we got early film appearances from people who became fairly recognizable in later years, especially Margot Kidder, who played the drunken Barb. This is certainly deserving of recognition as an influential film that helped in the rise of a genre that has sadly now often chosen to focus on blood and gore more than story. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas: A Frightening Holiday Slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Psycho," and "Peeping Tom," people wonder whether movies like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or "Halloween" invented the slew of slasher films that we get today. But hardly anyone gives credit to a 1974 film directed by Bob Clark that guarantees some serious chills. It's frightening, and weird, and yet, "Black Christmas" goes unnoticed. Perhaps the older genre fans have set aside a place in history for the film, but the more contemporary audiences hardly know it exists. This is where my review of "Black Christmas" begins.A figure approaches the Pi Kappa Sig sorority house. He climbs up the ladder to the highest window, and isolates himself in the attic. Below the attic door is a party. The sisters of the sorority (including Jess, Clare, Phyllis, and Barb) are enjoying themselves one last time before Christmas break. Many of them are leaving for the holidays while the rest stick around over the weekend to clean house with their house mother, Mrs. MacHenry(also known as Mrs. Mac). But as the obscene phone calls from an anonymous voice continue, and the girls quickly begin to disappear, the yuletide festivities are coming to a close and terror is setting in.Many movie buffs know Bob Clark for his classic comedies "A Christmas Story" and "Porky's," but don't let the fact that he directed "Black Christmas" fool you. The film is dark, and sincerely one of the scariest movies ever made.As I've stated before, the importance of the film lies within the fact that it was released four years before "Halloween." So, which film started the slasher saga? The argument has lasted forever. However, comparisons should not be drawn between the two. They are their own films with their own significance to the horror genre.The ingenious idea of inserting such a happy time of year into a time of fear and despair works extremely well. Since the film is set around Christmas time, the feeling of the holiday is evident throughout. There are decorations everywhere, as well as Christmas trees and snow. Throw the color of red onto snow, and the mood easily changes.Thanks to Roy Moore's script, not only does "Black Christmas" have a load of atmosphere, but it is also host to a series of some of the most profane, shocking, and outright creepy phone calls of all time. During the first call, the killer uses very foul language, and when Barb challenges him, his tone changes, and we hear a rather humanly voice simply say "I'm gonna kill you." From then forth, we are scared not just for ourselves, but for the sorority sisters also.You see, the characters of the film have such likability. Barb is the life of the party, but she means well. Poor Jess has a struggling relationship with her boyfriend Peter, who joyously accepts that she is pregnant but immediately becomes furious when he finds out that she's planning an abortion. These characters feel real, even when there's some comic relief from the house mother and the police department. You don't want to see them die.Telling from the phone calls, the killer keeps everything under wraps. We don't know who he is or what he plans to do, but he gives himself slight recognition of his identity by simply nicknaming himself 'Billy.' The rest of the time, we never truly see the face of the villain. In fact, we don't see much of him period. When we do feel his presence, it is in his perspective, from his point of view. While he's freaking out in the attic, we're freaking out in the attic. When he's killing somebody, we become him. It's an uncomfortable and horrifying notion, and that's why it works.In terms of acting, the cast is above average. Olivia Hussey (whose star quality was projected in "Romeo &amp; Juliet") makes for a terrific Scream Queen as Jess. Also, the early Andrea Martin and Margot Kidder keep things going as Phyllis and Barb. The appearance of genre vet John Saxon as Lieutenant Fuller is also worth noting, as well as Keir Dullea ("2001: A Space Odyssey") as Peter.All in all, it's a shame that the subordinate remake of this fright-fest got minimal attention and the original film got no attention at all. Thankfully, a DVD release has fixed the problem, and more fans have found a place in their heart for the film. It's still not as popular as "Halloween" is, but "Black Christmas" is a horror classic. It will scare and shock you, and equally provide you with a healthy dose of entertainment. This one's a must-see!P.S. The "eye behind the door" scene still keeps me up at night!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True horror is a mood...and nothing is moodier than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really good horror movies stay with you for life.Any idiot with a camera can pull you into a one-off scare with a ghoul's mask and a horrendously loud stab of music, but it takes real chops to pull off something as cumulatively horrific as Bob Clark's 1974 indie masterpiece. Watching it is like being at the center of a really macabre jigsaw puzzle that keep getting more forbidding and gruesome until you realize the last piece has your name on it.There are many exhaustive reviews (deservedly so) on this site that detail the plot, so I'm going to summarize the pieces of the puzzle that make it such a delight to return to time and again.1) The Sorority House - Just one look at this thing could send you running for the hills the way Clark, Art Director Karen Bromley, and DP Reg Morris have portrayed it. A look at the house in the daylight without the ominously warped lenses, dreary lighting, and blanketing snow reveals nothing remotely forbidding. But the thought of having to stay overnight there, as it's portrayed throughout the bulk of the film, with the majority of the occupants gone on winter break...chilling stuff. It's a character unto itself.2) Carl Zittrer's score - Quite possibly the most effective horror music soundtrack ever composed, it's a wonder for several reasons. It's economical. It uses what it needs to when it's needed. Zittrer tore up an old piano and raked the strings with a variety of odd objects, neatly echoing male lead Keir Dullea's avant garde mashing on the keys, when the character wasn't brooding ominously. Then there are the ghostly carols: "ooohs" and "aaahhhs" bent, slowed-down, sped-up, played backwards until they're ready to send you over the edge. Turn out the lights and turn up the volume on the newly remastered 5.1 soundtrack and watch your skin crawl.3) The Phone Calls - My god. Hey, there are a ton of menacing phone call movies, but nothing like this. The caller in "Black Christmas" doesn't just pant or moan or blare obscenities....he does all of this and more. "Could that possibly be ONE person?" Lynne Griffin's Claire asks the other girls early in the movie. It's a valid question, because the caller seemingly has a background soundtrack going while he's going out of his mind. Was he using a tape player? Probably, but who really cares? The point is this: the guy is obviously OUT OF HIS MIND. He's not trying to threaten, he's not trying to scare or pull a prank. He's merely letting the contents of his demented psyche loose in a torrent that's loaded with the organized chaos of a Jackson Pollack painting or John Zorn track on steroids. He laughs, screams, and sobs...many times all in the span of five seconds. The jarring vileness of these (many) calls was really toned down in the TV cut ("A Stranger In the House," which is how I first saw this --- and even hacked to pieces for late night TV it was disturbing - NBC would run it near the holidays in syndication after SNL, I remember).4. "Wrapped in Plastic" - Way before Twin Peaks, Black Christmas played with the idea of a killer "preserving" his kills with transparent casing. This is particularly morbid when they're stored in the attic of the house you happen to be occupying.5. The Totally Canadian Humor - With as much gloom and doom as BC has going for it, you'd think it would never make you crack a smile. But then again, it has two of the funniest, least self-conscious actresses playing supporting roles: Andrea Martin and Margot Kidder. And the late great Marian Waldman has the role of lifetime as a uniquely foul-mouthed, hard-drinking housemother who keeps bourbon in the toilet tank. And need I mention Doug McGrath's bumbling Sergeant Nash? His performance generates laughs and pathos simultaneously...he's a rube you can't help but pity, in a nice way.This film has an impressive fan base, and yes, it did fail when it was originally released. I hale from Peoria Illinois and it even hit our theaters a bit softly....but....the theater owners were shrewd enough to bring it back each Christmas for a limited late-night run. Why? because they knew it scared the crap out of the few who DID see it.It still does. And what better endorsement can you give a horror film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most frightening movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am 38 years old and I remember when this first came out on HBO back in the early 80's. I believe I was either ten or eleven when I first saw it. My parents went to sleep right before it came on and I stayed up to watch it (which they wouldn't have let me in any way if they knew this movie!). This was the movie that put a deep dread AND fascination in me for horror movies and suspense/thrillers. It terrified me beyond words, yet as good horror movies do they take you for a ride that thrills you to your core. Man, I remember the unbelievable dread at the end of the movie and after it was over I remember saying to myself "That was the most scared I've ever been".There have been times as an adult that took me back to the horror that this movie implanted in me as a child....One night, sleeping in my apartment alone, I was suddenly awoken by my door opening. I slept in almost complete darkness at the time. I jumped into the "fight or flight" mode and the flight took control...I screamed and screamed like a little girl throwing my pillow at the unseen attacker! I was able to turn on the lights and I came to find out that the wind (during the summer with windows open) was responsible for pushing my door open when it wasn't shut all the way. I woke up my neighbors with the screams and commotion I made and they called the cops thinking I was being murdered! LOL Man was I embarrassed! But after it was over I remembered that that fear I felt was so similar to the fear I first felt when I watched Black Christmas all those years before.Another instance when, I was a teen, I remember watching a news broadcast which told of a stranger living in the basement of a family's house for several months before the family found out. I believe the man was insane and would come upstairs in the dead of night to sneak food and use the bathroom. Apparently he would go upstairs while everyone slept and watch them. He didn't hurt them, but MAN! That gave me the same creeps that this movie did. It made me search every square inch of my house, during the day with a shotgun! I guess it just goes to show that a truly good scary movie like this one can really get under your skin! Some folks give this movie a four, three and even two star rating, which amazes me. There really is no film that compares with this one for the creepiness and dread. I think that the younger folks who are more used to the modern horror movies just can't appreciate, I believe, the genius of the suspense, dread and insane-ness of this movie.If you are twenty five and younger, try watching this movie by yourself, alone in the dark of night. You'll then understand that feeling of deep dread and "creepiness" that will make you stop the movie, turn on all the lights and re-check the windows and doors and the closets and under the bed...and maybe even the attic if you have the strength to do so!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slasher classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, in the main because I have read from several sources that this was massively influential on Halloween, the John Carpenter slasher classic. I have to say, though, (and I'm not proud of this) that I found this to be very boring throughout. There's some good POV work, which I guess is the inspiration behind many of the similar scenes in Halloween, but overall it's all a little too soap opera, with endless scenes of Sorority dullards wittering senseless prattle. I must confess that the film has one of the finest taglines I've ever read: "If this film doesn't make your skin crawl...it's on too tight." Pure quality.I don't know, maybe I was expecting too much, but this just left me a little cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect slasher if not for the bloated subplots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to write a review for Black Christmas. On one hand I thought much of the movie was a pathetic attempt at an emotional slasher film, and on the other hand there were scenes that were some of the best kill/scares in the history of horror movies. It's almost like Black Christmas flirts with perfection then jumps back to lame subplots. Yes, I understand that this film literally invented the slasher genre, but, no, I cannot call it perfect?I can only call certain aspects perfect.As I said, the main standout flaw is the complete lack of focus. The movie starts out in a sorority house, but from there jumps to a lot of other places to focus on characters and subplots that don't really matter to the story at all. The whole subplot of Clare's father coming to the sorority house was completely pointless by the end of the film, and just takes away from the actual story. The subplot between Jess and her boyfriend should have been cut much shorter, in order to, once again, focus on the actual story. Most of all, the subplot of the missing child still has nothing to do whatsoever with anything else in the film. I don't understand why the director takes 20 minutes to go into it, when in the end, like all the other subplots, it is nothing important. It could have easily been a passing reference instead of its own section of the film. The police scenes, also, added nothing to the story except take away from the amazing atmosphere. Everything the police scenes added could have been done with phone conversations, instead of taking up half the movie time to show things the audience could have guessed. Without all these subplots the movie would have been much, much more effective and tense.Another problem I had was the title of the film is Black Christmas, but other than the opening and one of the death scenes, nothing in this movie referenced Christmas at all. Most of the time there wasn't even snow on the ground. It would have been so much more emotionally effective if it played into the Christmas nostalgia more than it did, but the movie made the ability to play Christmas songs more of a gimmick than a plot point.Though I'm being negative with almost every aspect of the film, I really did enjoy part of it?the actual story. When the movie isn't trying to have five different subplots that go nowhere, the actual core story is done to perfection. The killer, the kills, the girls, the sorority house, the phone calls, the ending?all truly perfect, and by far the greatest slasher of all time. It's sad to see what is really a beautiful minimalist horror story turned into a bloated crime drama with more pointless subplots than kills, and that is the only thing holding this film from perfection.Overall, I wish I could go in and just watch the actual plot happen in Black Christmas, but I can't. Still, as much ranting as I did, there is something there that makes it better than so many movies that I've rated higher. Something that Hollywood forgot four decades ago. Maybe it's the fact this movie has very little blood, but is still very effective. Or, maybe, it's that the core plot was actually thought out, truly terrifying, emotionally captivating, and also something original that had never been done before it. I think that is it.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked Classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Halloween was this little Canadian shocker in the 1974 that has long been overshadowed by Halloween which in part was originally perceived as a follow up to this film.The film takes place over the Christmas holidays which makes it the prefect horror to watch at Christmas, in fact the first time i watched it was about 2 days before Christmas eve!! It revolves around an unknown psychopathic killer picking off a group of sorority girls one by one in a pretty large and spooky house.Although Halloween is still one of my favourite horror films I can't help but notice that although it has stood the test of time fairly well it is a lot less scarier than it was all those years ago. This is not the case with Black Christmas. This film was made so well in so many aspects such as the music, the premise and the photography it still scares me to this day. In fact this is the only old school slasher film which I would have no hesitation in putting on to scare the living daylights out of someone in today's modern age.I seriously urge you to watch this film if you haven't done so already as this film is guaranteed to scare the crap out of you; and what ever you do "don't go up the stairs!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic, Non-cliché, Underrated Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film gives me the chills! The story is about a killer who breaks into a sorority house and hides in the basement while killing the women in the house. You have Jess (the always beautiful and heartbreaking Olivia Hussey), a young woman facing an unexpected pregnancy and facing up to her high strung, emotional boyfriend, Peter (2001: A Space Odyssea's Keir Dullea). Then you have outspoken, drunk, Barb (Margot Kidder, who is excellent in her earlier role). The atmosphere is perfectly set: like the weather it is cold and chilling. It is a horrible nightmare of the idea that a homicidal nutjob is not only killing but hiding in the place where the murders are taking place. The film has a Hitchcock quality to it and more frightening is that we never see what the killer looks like and we see him killing through his point of view. It is such a shame and an embarrassment that they had to make a remake of this when certain filmmakers in Hollywood are not clever enough to come up with originals. Great thriller: intelligent, disturbing, and amazingly well acted by the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank Heavens For Caller ID!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I sat down to watch "Black Christmas" (1975) for the first time, director Bob Clark had been two for two with me. I had loved his previous two flicks--the zombie gut-muncher "Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things" and his living-dead Vietnam vet horror comedy "Deathdream," both from 1972--and so was very stoked to see "Black Christmas," a film with a great rep and a loving cult behind it. Now that I have finally seen the film, I'm aware of what this cult has known for decades: This movie, besides being highly influential, is also intelligently scripted, well acted by all, deliberately paced and, ultimately, extremely suspenseful. Concerning a psychopathic nutjob who not only makes obscene phone calls to a sorority house (possibly the creepiest phone calls in screen history; you'll be thanking heaven for modern-day "caller ID"), but who also hides in the attic and does some occasional butchering, the film is the template for a raft of more famous slasher flicks that followed. Margot Kidder, Andrea Martin and especially the gorgeous Olivia Hussey (I just love the way she says "Hello") are all very fine, and John Saxon, here playing a police lieutenant, gets a chance to show how very appealing he can be when NOT playing coldhearted dirtbags. I must confess that the first time I watched this film, the open-ended finale left me a little annoyed (I guess I needed a bit more closure); I didn't mind this ending the second time I watched the picture, however, and even thought it kinda cool and freaky. To make things even better, the "Special Edition" DVD that I just watched comes with almost two hours' (!) worth of interviews, plus other features. It is truly a godsend for all members of the "Black Christmas" cult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ Black Christmas is a mainstay of slasher cinema. It is one of the early films that set the standard for what would come. But if you are going to enjoy the movie, I must warn you of the hype. Black Christmas was said to have been better than Halloween by many people. I had heard this on numerous occasions before watching the film. I should have known that was untrue (Halloween in one of my favorite films). That stigma may have hindered my enjoyment of the movie somewhat. Now, don't let my complaints lead you away from the picture. Regardless of a little over hyping, it is a must-see. I wouldn't say that Halloween is in any way, shape, or form a copy of Black Christmas, but John Carpenter may owe a bit to the film. The opening shots of the film beautifully utilize the POV shots we are used to seeing in countless slasher films. And of course the holiday title is something Bob Clark should be thanked for. What Clark did differently was to break almost every slasher film rule before they were even written. In a normal flick, the people who have sex get it first and the heroine is always virginal. Not so in this case. The first girl killed is the virgin and our heroine is far from virginal: she's pregnant! It is very unconventional and impressive in that regard. Also impressive is John Saxon, as always. The man is a genre icon. Actually, the acting from everyone in the film is superb. I found that to be another surprising factor. But with names like Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, and Art Hindle I should have expected quality performances. My main complaint is the pacing and the ending. The film crawls along a bit before really picking up and the ending isn't justified. I like the fact that the killer does not die and his motives go completely unexplained. I thought that was brilliant. The problem with the ending is that there is no reason why the girl is left alone in that house. Why did everyone just disappear? Shouldn't she have been rushed to the hospital? Much like the ending of Poltergeist (where the family stays in the house one more night), there isn't sufficient enough reason for what happened. But the final shots would have lost their impact without a helpless girl still in the house. So despite a few flaws and its hype of being better than Halloween, I would say you couldn't go wrong revisiting this holiday classic. Avoid the remake AT ALL COSTS!</fullReview>

This one of the first slashers though and it seems like other slasher movies, have a lot to be thankful for, concerning boundary breaking ideas! Having said that, you have to feel free to enjoy a movie with no plot whatsoever, with girls (victims) on a Christmas day and a killer on the loose. That's all you get (plus a few death scenes of course) and if that's you're cup of tea, why not watch this movie and see how they did it in the 70s. Much better than the remake then!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that started it all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earlier this month, cult director Bob Clark tragically died in a car accident with his son. To me, Clark was a huge inspiration, an extremely talented and criminally overrated filmmaker who never got the credit he deserved. I admit to liking almost every single one of his films, although the two that will always remain my favorites are Porky's and the original Black Christmas. To truly understand the brilliance behind this masterful motion picture, one had to understand the time at which it was released. Black Christmas came out a full decade before I was born, so I'm not a person that can give a film historian perspective, but I can probably safely say that there was no other horror flick like Black Christmas upon its release in 1974, four years before John Carpenter's Halloween, which 'Christmas' influenced. Personally, I think Halloween is a slightly better movie, but this is the one that started the slasher genre, which depending on your opinion, is either a great thing or a horrible thing. Love it or hate it, there is no denying the impact.What is debatable is whether or not Black Christmas is a good movie. Some point to amateurish acting and age as factors for it not living up to its hype while others like myself argue that the only it only appears dated since all the plot devices have since been done in no less than a hundred other copycats. The acting remains a mixed bag. Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, and John Saxon or solid in their roles. The other sorority sisters and police don't fare so well yet none of the performances are bad enough that they ruin any of the scenes. In fact, when compared to the performances in mainstream horror released today, they are much superior. Also in contrast to today's standards, Black is Christmas is essentially gore free. Bob Clark doesn't try to gross the audience out, and the saying less is more definitely applies here.The ending is still a topic of argument among fans today. It is an ambiguous ending for sure, though I've never liked it that much. It works, but barely. Despite the ending, Black Christmas is still a favorite of mine and a must watch over the holiday season. A remake came out last year. I doubt I have to even say how it turned out. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Students of a sorority house start receiving a series of increasingly frightening prank phone calls, escalating into a series of ghastly murder in this effectively creepy tightly-plotted little movie. All of the major actors in it feel real and fleshed out, barring an underused James Edmond as Clair's father. Perhaps it hasn't aged as well as everyone would have hoped, (the abortion sub-plot, really doesn't have anything to do with anything, and some of the dialog comes off as hokey now) but with this and "A Christmas Story" Bob Clark has made two of the staples of holiday viewing, albeit in opposite ends of the spectrum. It's too bad that he hasn't done anything good since 1983.My Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BLACK CHRISTMAS is one of the best of the horror genre and HALLOWEEN, although a great film itself, borrows much from this film - John Carpenter was friends with Bob Clark and even had asked Clark if he was going to do a sequel. Bob Clark, director of the excellent CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS and DEATHDREAM, told Carpenter that he was not going to do a sequel, but, if he was, it would be called HALLOWEEN. Carpenter's opening is very similar in style to Clark's opening, as if the killer POV camera work and the killer lurking out of the frame. Olivia Hussey is not the virginal heroine (her character is pregnant and determined to abort the baby) and a lot of film books and reviews incorrectly identify Keir Dullea as the killer when he is obviously not. I have heard complaints regarding the ending and the unknown identity of the killer because most viewers have been conditioned to have everything explained to them &amp; tied up in a neat little package, a la the ending of PSYCHO, but that only makes the film more unique. It was one of the first and the acting is superb for this type of effort. In a fair world it would be every bit as popular as HALLOWEEN, but given the amount of posts for this film, it shows that BLACK CHRISTMAS is very much appreciated by horror fans. I read an interview with Bob Clark on FANGORIA'S web site that a remake of BLACK CHRISTMAS is in the works, as well as a remake of DEATHDREAM and either a remake or sequel to CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS. Another great Bob Clark film worth checking out is MURDER BY DECREE, in which Sherlock Holmes takes on the Jack the Ripper slayings. It's a shame that Clark turned his back on the horror genre after BLACK CHRISTMAS and directed crap like the PORKY'S movies and LOOSE CANNONS. If he would have kept his hand at horror, I predict that he would have been one of the biggest names in the field today.</fullReview>

But finally about 2 years ago i got a chance to see it.I was pretty pumped from all that i heard, but too be honest i was let-down.I found the movie a bit slow paced.A bunch of Sorority sisters are celebrating the Christmas season and the end of the semester.But their fun is brought to an end with an obscene phone call and death threats from the caller.Roy Moore wrote a good script but i feel never took it to the next level, and Director Bob Clark did a fine job.While Black Christmas does have a lot in common with Halloween. I feel that Halloween is the better film.Black Christmas does have pretty good suspense plus a good scare or two i still feel a bit let-down.But if you're a die hard horror fan i am sure you will enjoy it on some level.Worth a check, While i don't hate it, i don't think it's has good as some people made it out to be.I give Black Christmas 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought John Carpenter's Halloween and Friday the 13th were the films that everyone else got their inspiration from in the horror biz. Then I heard that Halloween copied some movie called Black Christmas. I wondered how a film could be so good even Halloween lifted from it, and I would never hear about it or see it anywhere. Where's its reputation? Well, I watched it, and I can't explain why this film is not more widely known because Halloween is almost a carbon copy of this movie! And this came out years earlier! All the stuff used to scare in Halloween is done here first, and much better, too! It's set on a holiday, there's a killer on the loose, the police are searching for him, he kills young girls, etc. It even has an ending like Halloween. Whether intended or not, Carpenter is just a rip-off. This film is way scarier than Halloween, the acting is better, the direction is perfect, and the writing flawless. This is one of the first movies that uses the now-tired line "Jesus, you scared the hell out of me!" I laughed when I heard it because every movie says it now, but this actress actually said it believably. This movie will scare you. Near the end the officer working on the case discovers that the obscene phone calls the girls are getting are coming from inside the sorority house they are staying in. It reminded of the timeless urban legend, except that featured a babysitter. Watch this film. This is THE real classic, forget all the others that take credit for it. Look at the beginning with the POV shots with the killer. It is EXACTLY like Halloween's opening. It's a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, Black Christmas is not in my mind a "great horror classic", as some other people have said. Why? Because it's all violence and a non-exsistent story.The story (warning, spoilers): The film opens at night with a small party occurring in a sorority house for a private school. We are introduced to all of the girls in the sorority house, the main ones being Jess, the heroine of the film, Barb, a drunken loud mouth, and Phyllis, Jess' friend and the peace keeper of the group. The girls have been receiving mysterious phonecalls from someone they call "The Moaner". The calls start out sexual in nature, but they gradually grow more macabre, with the man on the other end saying strange things in different voices. The shyest sorority girl, Claire, goes upstairs to pack, and when she goes into the closet, the killer dives out and wraps a plastic bag around her head. He then drags her into the attic, and puts her in a rocking chair. The next day, Claire's father comes to pick her up, but nobody knows where she is. It becomes a mystery as the police search for the missing Claire. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mac, the house mother, stumbles upon the killer and gets a crane hook in the face. Meanwhile, Jess admits to her boyfriend Peter that she is pregnant, but she's having an abortion. He begins to act strange, and shows off some anger problems. As Barb and Phyl are murdered by the killer, Jess gets another call. The police trace the call and realize that the calls are coming from in the house. Instead of going out, Jess goes upstairs and is attacked by the killer. She manages to escape and heads to the basement. There she runs into Peter, who she now falsely believes is the killer. He approaches her to talk, but Jess hits him over the head and kills him. The police feel the case is closed, and leave the house, leaving Jess alone to sleep off the excitement. As the credits begin to roll, we hear the phone ring once again.Now, this film has major plot spoilers, such as(warning, more spoilers): Police arrive at the home but make no effort to search it, despite two bodies having been undiscovered. (Also noteworthy is that an officer notes "The local morgue cannot handle this many bodies.") The deranged killer is able to repeat lines of dialogue from other characters on the phone, though it seems almost impossible he could have heard them despite being in the house. Despite the parent of one victim being around for the entire movie, no one suggests searching for his daughter when the mystery appears to be solved and she has not been found. Police leave the final potential victim alone in the house sleeping. (Sploliers end now)Basiclyy, this film is all blood and no story. Even though Halloween, (1978) is a rip-off of it, (in my opinion), it's all far better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the best of its type; a crazed killer stalks a coed in a sorority house and unmercifully butchers her closest friends and any passersby that just happen to get in his way. What separates this from the typical slasher fare is an above-average script, above-average acting, and really good direction. Director Bob Clark, the director of such films like Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things and Murder by Decree, seemingly does everything right in this one and makes all the right choices(well, most of the time at least). His flair for creating hauntingly eerie scenes that stay with you is first-rate. Take the first murdered girl(happens in first ten minutes). We never see the killer but just his eyes. The girl is saran-wrapped in a dress bag and set in a rocking chair with an old doll. Her presence is filmed in such a stark manner as to really set the mood of this whole film. Clark then effectively builds tension by the girl's father looking for her - as no body is found - the coed, played by the beautiful Olivia Hussey, consistently receiving phone calls from what is some sick sex pervert on the outside, the police are then brought into the mix, and finally some red herrings that throw the viewer off track a bit at the very least. All this goes on with snow, caroling, decorations, and Christmas atmosphere like one might expect in a small college town of a similar ilk. The first death scene is for my money the most effective shot and running scene in the entire film, but there are other equally brilliant shots that Clark uses to shock and create suspense. One scene in particular has Margot Kidder getting acquainted with the man with the creepy eyes with cuts(no pun intended) to children singing mellifluous carols at front door for Hussey. The acting all around is pretty good. Hussey is adequate. Kidder is too. Andrea Martin is along as well. The main policeman is John Saxon. He is pretty good and seems to flourish in roles like this in the seventies. Many films have tried to create the same effect as Black Christmas, but so few have come close at all to reaching the level of this - at least in this genre. An impressively shot film with good locations and a very effective ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminally underrated slasher film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas is an effectively moody &amp; very scary horror thriller, that will shred the nails of even the most jaded of horror fans! Sadly it also carries the reputation of being one of the most criminally underrated &amp; forgotten of the slasher films amongst todays horror fans &amp; critics. True the film wasn't as successful box office wise as HALLOWEEN &amp; Friday the 13th, nevertheless I think it's perfectly fair to say that Black Christmas created the rules of the genre, Friday the 13th &amp; HALLOWEEN merely just took those &amp; ran with them &amp; just happened to have more success than this one did. The film is unbearably suspenseful at times as director (the late) BOB CLARK infuses the film with several chilling moments that could rival any moments of suspense &amp; terror of some of the most reviled horror films that fans hold dear. Make no mistake about it, the minute it starts, Black Christmas wastes no time in delivering the chills one expects from a truly great scary, moody &amp; suspenseful horror film, as we see the killer (who remains unseen throughout the whole movie, with the exceptions of his hand, eyes &amp; shadow) stalking around the sorority house, in an opening scene John Carpenter swiped for the opening of his horror classic HALLOWEEN four years later, as we see things through the killer's point of view. The final twenty minutes of the film are a real nail shredder, as the heroine quickly learns that not only is she the last one left alive in the house, but also the very maniac she fears, is waiting for her upstairs! Despite it's low budget, the acting here blows practically every other bit of acting in a horror film out of the water! The cast chosen here are really talented &amp; help make their fun characters all the more interesting, particularly MARGOT KIDDER as as an alcoholic, bad girl sorority sister &amp; OLIVIA HUSSEY as the lead heroine. Director BOB CLARK shows what a talent he is &amp; delivers some of the best, if not the best directing in a horror film, in fact Clark himself is perhaps the most criminally underrated film-maker to ever step foot in the film industry &amp; I say that because he created two film genres, that has led to financial success at the box office for Hollywood, one is the "slasher film" but also the "teen sex comedy" that he helped usher in a few years after this film with PORKY'S. Both PORKY'S &amp; Black Christmas helped shape up both genres that are pretty prevalent in the film industry today &amp; sadly Clark doesn't get credited with creating either. Another sad thing about Black Christmas being an underrated gem in the horror genre, is the fact that the films main villain (BILLY) is hardly (if ever) listed as one of the most terrifying villains in horror filmdom &amp; I say that's sad, because he should get the same recognition as guys like Jason Freddy &amp; Michael &amp; Leatherface, since he is equally as scary as either one of these popular horror icons. By the films ending, we never really know why Billy has selected the sorority house as the site of his murdering spree, who he is, why he does what he does etc. &amp; while this usually works against most horror films &amp; horror movie villains &amp; can make them less interesting, the truth is it works in Black Christmas favour, by the films end credits, perhaps the most terrifying thing about him, is simply the fact Billy has not been captured, in fact he's still on the loose &amp; lurking around the attic of the sorority house which the camera pans up to after visiting the scenes of his crimes (Another thing Carpenter swiped for HALLOWEEN, by having that films villain the crazed Michael Myers also still be alive &amp; on the loose &amp; visiting the scenes of his crimes by the time that films credits have run). While mentioning Carpenter's classic, I also have to make mention that minus the things I already mentioned, another thing that connects the two, is that both films villains are very similar, not in terms of personality (Michael is silent, this guy talks, though anything he says is down right chilling) but in the simple fact that it could be argued that both villains are lightly hinted at as being demoniacally possessed. What with Michael's habits of appearing &amp; re-appearing in certain places like a ghost, him surviving six gun shot wounds, various stabbings &amp; a fall off a building &amp; this killer, who's phone calls sounds like several voices talking a once, with some of the voices sounding very inhuman. Even though we hardly see him in the movie, we can still feel this killers presence around, even in scenes he's not in, where people are just talking &amp; that in my eyes is a true testament to how scary Black Christmas actually is. There is no gore on hand, as practically all the kills are done off screen, but they are very inventive, particularly the opening kill of the one sorority sister, who is smothered to death with a plastic bag over her face &amp; then placed in a rocking chair in the attic to look out the attic window (which could arguably be construed as a back handed tribute to PSYCHO (1960) in a kill that was such a favourite of those who saw it, that it now adorns practically every video box art &amp; is one of the best images the film is known for.

		<shortDescription>A bizarrely, terrifying mystery picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was at one point critized as being another countless Halloween clone, however this terrifying film was released four years before Halloween, and was re-released shortly after Halloween. In any rate, Black Christmas is a stylish, sleak and mysterious film about a sorority house which is terrorized by an unknown assialiant during Christmas break and makes frightening phone calls and then kills the sorority sisters one by one. The film has a resembled all-star cast including Olivia Hussey (Romeo and Juliet) in the lead role, Keir Dullea (2001- A Space Oddessy) protrays her estranged boyfriend, Margot Kidder (Sisters, Superman) is funny as the drunk and bitchy Barb, Andrea Martin (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) plays the caring Phyl and John Saxon (Nightmare on Elm Street) protrays the worried and hard ass detective. Canadian actress Marian Waldman also stars as the funny and loveable sorority house mother. This film was directed by Bob Clark who did a fine job at creating suspense and building tension and a good twist in the end. Clark went on to direct the Porky's films and the classic A Christmas Story. Black Christmas is highly recommended of fans of the early slasher genre, it should be viewed before seeing Halloween and other popular slasher films of the 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this in about 10 years, but it really chilled me then and I've not forgotten it. A killer is hiding up in the attic of a sorority house. Who is it? Who will be next to die? Some of the violence is on the gruesome side, but the film's priority is a chilly, scary atmosphere, and this it accomplishes with appropriately grainy photography and realistic locations. The finale is so straight-forward it almost takes a few seconds to sink in..but the unshakable effect it left on me is still memorable. Not a fun night at the movies, but for this genre not bad. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but far from great horror thriller (SPOILERS HEREIN!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas was a good movie. In fact, it could have reached Hitchcockian greatness if not for two flaws: 1.) Why did the police decide Peter was the killer after Jess killed him? Hadn't it already been established that he had been in the room when one of the calls had been made? This is more than a nitpicky point -- it shakes the foundations of the whole story.2.) Now, this one is more subjective. I had trouble rooting for Jess because she was such a vicious ice queen. In all honesty, I felt sorry for Peter. First, his girlfriend tells him that she's pregnant, going to have an abortion, and there's no damn way she'll consider otherwise. As a result, a crucial recital goes down very badly. And on top of it all, the poor guy gets killed and he hadn't even killed anyone.Sure, the guy may have been a trifle high-strung, but Jess comes off as plain selfish. If she was planning to have an abortion and would consider no other option, why did she even bother to tell the guy, especially on the day of his recital? By the end of the movie, I was rooting for "Billy" to go psycho on her ass.Women with major moral flaws were often featured in Hitchcock's films. However, he worked it so we cheered for them in spite of their flaws. This movie expects us to cheer for the heroine because of them. Thirty-one years on, it doesn't wash.</fullReview>

Exceptionally well directed and crafted film features the right amount of humor and chills to keep you at the edge of your seat. The film grips you into it early on with a frightening phone call and keeps you in its grip all the way untill the finish with a bone chilling ending. Olivia Hussey turns in an excellent performance as the pregent heroine, Keir Duella is terrifying as Hussey's controlling boyfriend, and Margot Kidder is an absolute riot as a druken sorority sister.Trivia note: Film predates both Halloween and When A Stranger Calls by several years.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie because I was told it was an over-looked classic. After watching it, I now know why it's "over-looked". This movie may have came out before Halloween, but it's inferior in every possible way to Carpenter's masterpiece. For starters, the amount of plot holes in this film is large. One glaring one being when Billy makes the phone calls and screams at the top of his lungs from supposedly in the house, nobody hears him. I can't fathom that. They must of been deaf. I'm still also confused as to how Billy can make those calls inside the house. How can he dial the same number from a phone inside the same house? Aren't all of the lines connected? Why would the phone ring? It makes no sense to me. I also found it funny how the cops didn't seem to bother checking around the house to find any bodies...as the body upstairs of the first girl murdered is shown at the ending.All and All, I felt this movie was poorly written. It didn't scare me one bit. If anything I laughed multiple times at the bad acting and incoherent rants from Billy. It gets a 4/10 from me, and that's being generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SpoilersBLACK Christmas is neither scary or even creepy. And it's definitely not the first slasher. The amount of buzz this film has is truly perplexing. This film often played on TV during the late 1970s and early 1980s and I watched it a couple of times then and it didn't even scare me then, when I was 13-14 years old, and the movie still didn't create any sense of dread or horror today. The pacing is sloooow. The killings are boring and the whole idea is mishandled, with too much time spent with the stupid police officers and the sorta seedy side of the gals, such as the scene with that old woman finding a bottle of alcohol in the toilet, which adds nothing to the movie. The good cast of actors overacts shamelessly. But the worst part of this bland movie is the ending. The woman just killed her boyfriend and she's in shock and the police leave her alone at the house?!?! Now come on! That's totally ridiculous! The ending just doesn't work because it defies common sense. Watch the original THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE instead. Now that's a horror movie that hasn't lost any of its edge and makes BLACK Christmas look like kids stuff.</fullReview>

Those were the days. That and smoking grass and getting obliviously loaded everyday at school.Plus tackling a very real issue, pregnancy and abortion.It's all very believable and very scary.

		<fullReview>The film opens with a creepy POV cam shot of a person spying through windows and proceeds to scale up the lattice to an open attic window.Four girls Jess, party animal Barb, Phyllis, Clare, and Claude the cat are harassed by a obscene caller they dub "The Moaner" alone in a sorority house under the care of a drinker house mother named Mrs Mac. The calls have begun a day before Christmas Eve. When everybody is getting ready to spend the holiday weekend with family or friends or boyfriends.This same day Phyllis has promised to go skiing with Barb and her parents, Clare plans are to be picked up by her father, and Jess wants to meet her boyfriend Peter before his piano recital whose stressed he hasn't slept for three days.But that night when our home invader kills Clare before she can say goodbyes to her sorority sisters and her boyfriend Chris and hides her body in the attic, and her father comes to meet her at the appointed time at the university, well, it puts a damper on everyone's holiday weekend plans because Clare will soon be officially a missing persons report on Christmas Eve.Between harassing obscene phone calls Mrs Mac, Barb, and Phyllis are forced to delay plans and reluctantly play host to Mr Harrison taking turns even. Jess goes to the conservatory to drop the big bomb on poor Peter before his recital no less, she is pregnant and wants an abortion. Peter disagrees and believes it is a choice they both need to make but his argument doesn't make much head way and Jess makes him promise to stop by the sorority house after the recital to discuss their future plans in greater detail. Hey, there is a pattern here stay tuned.Christmas Eve, Claude the cat found Clare and is kind enough to lead Mrs Mac to it. Clare is officially reported missing to Lt Fuller (John Saxon). Lt Fuller organizes a large search party of volunteers and police to comb a local park and the surrounding neighborhoods with the assistance of Jess, Barb, Phyllis, Chris, and Mr Harrison. They find a dead body of a girl but no Clare. Peter bombs his recital. Returning back to the sorority house it is evident to our trio of girls that Mrs Mac has left the building. Barb who is nearly obscene as "The Moaner" finally crashes from two straight days of hard drinking. Jess receives another bad call and reports the phone stalker to the police when in steps in Peter who had been waiting upstairs. They argue Jess isn't going to give her planned future but Peter wants to give up his doesn't want to be a concert hall pianist anymore and neither wants to work at the conservatory anymore he wants to get married.Lt Fuller arrives to set up the tap passing a departing Peter, learning that the sorority house has two lines, one in the living room and hall and the other in Mrs Mac's room. He also stations a patrol car outside. Two fails to track the phone stalker but the killer drops a quote of a statement Peter made that same evening. Uh-oh. Jess and Lt Fuller are coming to the same conclusions. Lt Fuller follows this lead to a destroyed piano in the conservatory and Jess's greatest fears are allayed by Phyllis who reminds her that Peter was visiting them when the phone stalker dialed them up making him the suspect impossible.This films suffers a lot of errors in continuity and gaping plot holes. If the phone lines are only in living room, the hall, and Mrs Mac's room how is the killer moving around undetected? There isn't a phone jack in the attic. And how come the girl's failed to hear him yelling from Mrs Mac's room? And how did he leave the house, kill patrolman Jennings, and get back inside the house undetected by the sorority sisters nor the search party outside? Yeah, he could of went back down the lattice from the attic window and again back up? Still... I ain't buying it. Unless our killer is a flipping ninja yeah that is what he is. *Gives self-induced facepalm* D'oh.This is a classic slasher maybe deserves a better rating but I didn't find it all that scary, but rather silly, I didn't appreciate how forcibly determined the film chose to misdirect me. Actually, it would have been an improvement to this film if Peter did indeed suffer a mental breakdown leading to a homicidal psychosis. Keir Dullea fit the role like a hand-in-glove.</fullReview>

But no sequels though only a crappy remake in 2006 and even that was 33 years after the 1974 classic.The 2006 remake sucks, it tries to hard to be gory and violent when it doesn't look real, so DON'T WATCH IT (unless you want a good laugh at how rubbish it is) 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first bought this movie around Christmas time. And I had never seen this movie at all not even the trailer, but i heard i rocked! so i popped it in the DVD player at about around 11:00 pm. And i switched off the lights. This movie had a great atmospehre, it is a very dark film. After the movie was over, i sat there in shock. Most movies i've seen such as Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Friday the 13th. They don't really do that to me. But it made afraid of the dark again. Yes AGAIN. But the deaths are so different, and the suspense really builds up. This is my #1 favorite horror movie ever!! And it predated Halloween buy 4 YEARS! This is highly recommended to slasher buffs. If you are a fan of Gore there is very little this is not a gory movie at all! But this is still a great horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A real troubled psychopath has found a new home in the attic of a sorority and he often calls them to rant and rave perversities and memories which haunt him from the past involving Billy and Agnes. Who these two are isn't as important as the fact that the person blabbering incoherently and loudly about them is extremely dangerous and unhinged. While some of the sorority girls go on their Christmas vacations, a few remain and they are sharing their college house, unbeknownest to them, with the nutcase who continues to telephone harass them. When one of the girls is suffocated with a plastic bag, her body sitting comfortably in a rocking chair by the killer in the attic, the victim's father will come looking for her. His search, along with the scary phone calls, might just get the police into action..that and another missing girl in the area who was supposed to be coming home by way of the nearby park. What I think allows BLACK Christmas to persevere is the balance of laughs and chills. The mere thought of your house being invaded, without your knowledge, by a real wacko is frightening enough, not to mention the fact that he torments you by phone over and over with horrifying ramblings which make little sense, for the exception that the tone is disturbing. To open the film with the killer climbing up the wall and into the attic through a point-of-view shot really sets the viewer on edge for we experience his invasion personally..in his body, through his sight, we enter the house and know he, in essence, now has an advantage over those within the building. Clark uses the Keir Dullea character of Peter as a red herring, but I never felt he was the one behind the murders in BLACK Christmas. What is established though, and effectively I believe, is Peter's questionable sanity. Peter is quite an intense individual who can act irrational and immature. His whole piano recital goes haywire because Peter reacts through the musical arrangement the anger he feels towards pregnant girlfriend, Jess(Olivia Hussey), who wants an abortion. So even if he isn't the killer, Peter is certainly a bit suspect in behavior. Margot Kidder is obviously the comic relief, although I found her a bit sad because it seems she's using liquor and acidic humor as a means to hide certain underlying troubles and disappointments in life. Her fellatio scene with hapless Sargeant Nash(Doug McGrath) is recognized as a highlight, but her outbursts towards some of the girls(and their reactions of dismay)proves she can be a polarizing presence to those around her. John Saxon is Lt. Fuller, the detective who goes out of his way to find the missing girl(s)in his sleepy Canadian college town. Marian Waldman as the profane, alcohol-guzzling housemother, Mrs. Mac, also earns some giggles as she turns up various liquor bottles she has hidden in the house while grumbling about the demands of her position. James Edmond as the worried father, Mr. Harrison, dedicated to finding his daughter and Art Hindle, in an early part, as the girl's concerned boyfriend. Hussey, the lovely and elegant heroine who loses all of her friends while almost exclusively on the premises(memorable scene being when one of them is stabbed repeatedly with a glass unicorn while her Jess listens intently to carolers), is the anchor of the film, responsible for having to endure those burdensome phone terrorisms. Andrea Martin, the other sorority sister, Phyl, who is one of the unfortunates who stays at the house during the Christmas holiday. Certainly a loaded cast full of talent, but it's really the subject matter and Clark's ingenious methods of mystery in regards to the menace that really lifts this masterpiece of dread to its cult status which maintains thirty years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to make this kinda short. I just wanted to say that i don't understand how this movie got such great reviews. It wasn't horrible but I had always heard how great this movie was and i just don't get it. Maybe I missed something but it is so much like the other slashers. I found it to be kind of boring. Margot Kidder is drunk and annoying in this. The story dragged and I can't believe we never found out who the killer was. What, they couldn't find someone to play the killer or what? The one part I found kind of creepy was the part about the saran wrap. For those of you who think this is going to be the best movie ever, I'm telling you that it's not all it's cracked up to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very stylized and well done Canadian film. Excellent acting, mise en scene and good story. I love that big house. Film shot in Toronto in early '70's, with many scenes on the University of Toronto campus. I'd love to know where that house is. Is it near the U of T? Anyone know?Check out the low boom mike in the top frame during the first phone call. In the Critical Mass DVD, the trailer has famous actor James Mason as narrator! Also, Martha Gibson (who plays the dead-girl-in-the-park's mom, is none other than Marge Cicconi in the excellent murder mystery TV series of the 1980's "Seeing Things" (on Bravo Tuesday nights at 6:30pm).Anyone recognize Andrea Martin of Second City fame? Also, many character actors we see in the film are today doing commercials or TV dramas. The cop who got shot in the behind is often in commercials selling insurance or cold medicine. I wish Olivia Hussey did more film work today. Kind of sad in a way.The Critical Mass DVD has 2 short interviews with John Saxon (good interview in Filmfax #103/104) and movie trailer (with narrator James Mason!). Wish they put more interviews with other actors, director explaining behind the scenes, etc.</fullReview>

Olivia Hussey is fine as a sorority sister who is terrorized by unnerving calls to the house by an obscene presence. Margot Kidder, as an asthmatic sister, is foul-mouthed and funny. Keir Dullea plays a possibly disturbed pianist, who's also Hussey's boyfriend. The setting at Christmas time with all the lights, snow, coldness, is well-presented. The sorority house is suitably creepy, atmospheric,and claustrophobic, even in the Christmas decor. The justifiably famous "eyeball" scene will freeze your blood, and the closing scenes are startling.</fullReview>

The killer's ramblings over the phone were incoherent and nowhere near being scary or even slightly disturbing. The only redeeming qualities in this cure for insomnia was the Sorority Mom's stashes of liquor bottles everywhere, and the killer's eye peeking through the crack of the door, they were amusing and slightly creep respectively but, these offerings were far from enough to keep me interested in this painfully sorry excuse for a "horror" film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a horror film afficiando, I headed off to one of my local videostores to catch up on horror films that I ought to have seen for one reason or another. One of the films I picked up was this one, having read that it was probably the first slasher flick, which qualified it to my list. After watching it, I thought that it was very unsettling, but was it REALLY scary? And was it any good? Well, sort of. The problem with the film is that one, I couldn't care less about the characters, and when they go about acting like total idiots I even caught myself mumbling: "if he/she/it gets killed now he/she/it's got him/her/itself to blame". This keeps the film from really being scary, plus that, and this probably wasn't the case for the audience when it was released, the ending is so unbelievably predictable that it's plain silly.WARNING! SPOILER!I mean, if you have a long cameraroll that drifts from he bed where the heroine lies across the hall, doesn't that give it all away? And they basically signal that it's coming, I mean, why else would everybody leave the room? I called it right when the scene started!END OF SPOILERNow, don't get me wrong, it is a pretty good film. Now it's time to compare it to the other film of this kind, John Carpenter's "Halloween". There are similarities, but there is one significant difference. In "Halloween", we know who the killer is a couple of minutes in, in "Black Christmas" we don't. And that makes a bigger difference than one might think. One film which is a big ripoff of "Black Christmas" though is "Friday the 13th", which is built up in a similiar fashion, but is indeed a MUCH MUCH worse film. But back to "Black Christmas" vs "Halloween", the question now is, which one do I prefer? The answer is easy, I'll pick "Halloween" any day of the week. Why? Easy, Carpenter is a much more skilled director than Bob Clark and it shows in a major way. Clark manages to build an effective mood, but the mood Carpenter builds is more menacing than Clark could build in his dreams. SPOILER!Second of all, in "Halloween", the characters act more human. When they are given a chance to escape they take it, they don't go out to investigate.END OF SPOILERNext is the camerawork. It is similiar, but it's far more slick in "Halloween". The same goes for just about everything else in the film. But back to just "Black Christmas", the film is definitely worth the price of rental, since it is after all a sort-of classic. I personally don't think it's good enough to be classic in terms of quality, but does belong on the cult classic list since it helped spawn the genre that "Psycho" laid the building blocks for. But it's definitely not a masterpiece. According to me, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All things considered, it is difficult to understand exactly why Olivia Hussey remains fully clothed for the duration of this film, even granting it somewhat higher-brow status than its subsequent imitators. John Saxon plays John Saxon playing Michael Ironside playing John Saxon (the exact loop is lost somewhere in history), and Margot Kidder plays herself sometime in the indeterminate future. Notable for its indulgent approach to heavy drinking, its (the first of its kind in color) "shock" ending, and the strangest obscene phone calls you (god willing) will ever here. But back to Olivia--remember Romeo and Juliet? Sure, it's okay to let yourself be exploited for "literature," but not a holiday slasher flick? Where's the justice in that?</fullReview>

Now that I've seen it, I don't understand why so many think this was so scary. The movie seemed very slow at times. Also, there really was not much blood, gore, or killings. I did think that the phone calls were very creepy. I hated the end of this movie. There was no explanation for anything that happened. I felt like I watched the movie and I'm still waiting for it to end. Just horrible. Probably the worst ending ever. I did enjoy a young John Saxon though. I guess this movie is worth a viewing but that's about it. I also don't understand why some are comparing this to Halloween?

		<fullReview>After waiting all this time to see BC, Netflix finally started carrying it, and I promptly pushed it to the top of my queue. I wasn't expecting a film better than Halloween, as no horror can surpass it, IMO. I WAS expecting a creepy movie with some similar elements, though...and boy did this movie disappoint! The phone calls were nowhere near frightening or unsettling, and they actually made me laugh a few times. There was no build-up before any of the murders...I never once gripped the arm of the sofa, or felt the urge to yell, "look out, he's in the room!", which is what makes slashers so enjoyable. Th 'red herring' wasn't a very good one, because, well, WE knew it wasn't him, because we follow the murderer into the house in the very beginning, which made the revelation at the end kind of, erm, pointless. The movies was decently acted, though at times a bit overacted...John Saxon was the best thing about the movie. Overall, I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this 'classic' horror flick. I'll stick to Halloween, and many other look-a-likes, any day of the week. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might Have Been Impressive Way Back When... But Kind Of Old Hat Now...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BLACK CHRISTMAS (2 outta 5 stars)I remember that this movie was a big deal (at least in Canada) back in 1974. It was a huge hit and audiences raved about how scary it was. This was a slasher movie that pre-dated Halloween and Friday the 13th... it probably didn't seem as cliched then as it does now. In fact, a lot of scary movies that came out later sure seem to have been influenced by this one. Young women in a large, spooky sorority house are plagued by weird, obscene phone calls... and then mysteriously they start to vanish, one by one... victims of a crazed psycho killer (sound familiar yet?) The movie is competently-made... but the acting is very uneven. SCTV's Andrea Martin plays one of the sorority girls and it's a little difficult to accept her in a "straight" role... as accustomed as we are to see her making fun of movies like this. Margot Kidder plays another of the girls... the wild, outspoken, rebellious one (might as well have a target pinned to her back... dang!) The rest of the actors are Canadian performers of varying degrees of competence. Some of the scenes are suspenseful... even if some of the goings-on defy logic and/or common sense. (I mean, really...can nobody SEE the dead girl's body sitting right beside the upstairs window?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like, am I the only one who thinks that Black Christmas is nothing more than just an over-rated piece of 'Slasher Trash'? At best, I'd say that this particular Horror film is only marginally better than the rest of the junk that's out there.And, yes, I know that Black Christmas can, in a sense, be considered the "original" Slasher flick, since it proceeds both Halloween and Friday The 13th by years - But I honestly don't give a damn about that sort of thing - 'Cause I still don't think it's all that good, anyways.And, besides that - I still can't figure out how the heck the psycho-killer was able to make those insane phone calls of his from the attic inside the Sorority House. Like, that would've meant that he would've had to have had his own private line up there. And I sure don't recall seeing this nut making any sort of arrangements about this special 'obscene-calls only' service with the phone company, or anything like that.And speaking about those ghastly, irksome phone calls in Black Christmas - According to Director Bob Clark - 5 people (both men and women) were apparently responsible for talking all that gross gibberish stuff over the phone, including Clark, himself. I think it's kind of interesting to note how little profanity was actually used in the things that this wacko said.And, in conclusion - I can't begin to tell you how glad I am that Black Christmas was not followed by a bloody sequel. With the utterly dissatisfactory way in which this film ended, it was sure ripe for one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serial killer and a Sorority - before panty shots were the norm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Christmas break, but there's a serial killer terrorizing a college sorority. First there are the crank calls. Then he starts killing. This is a horror movie from Bob Clark who would be better known later for 'A Christmas Story', and the Porky's franchise. He's certainly much better in comedies than horror. He doesn't have the touch to juice up the intensity. This movie is far too slow. The kills have limited shock value.The den mother is boozy Mrs Mac. Margot Kidder plays the brash Barb. Olivia Hussey plays the pregnant Jess who's considering abortion. Andrea Martin plays Phyl. When they report a missing girl, the police is unconcerned, busy with a missing 13 year old girl named Janice Quaife. However Lt Fuller (John Saxon) soon realizes that there is something wrong going on.When a modern horror movie of a serial killer in a sorority, it's expected to have hot young co-eds strutting around in their panties. This was before that all started. It does have some modern touches like a killer's POV. But the lack of editing and its slow pace do hold it back. I consider it a transition piece that don't quite measure up to its more scary compatriots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Bob Clark is best known for his 1983 film A Christmas Story, the feel-good tale of a child who wants a Red Rider BB gun from Santa Claus. What a lot of people don't know, however, is that Mr. Clark has approached the holiday season from a much darker perspective. And his 1974 slasher, Black Christmas, is surprisingly effective.I'll be completely honest. I expected shoddy acting and lame scares to abound. Black Christmas does have its fair share of the preceding, but it also generates a somber, brooding atmosphere that's heightened by the frenzied piano stylings of a college student, named Peter, who appears to be on the verge of mental collapse. This guy is dating one of the sisters who lives in the sorority house where the bulk of the terror takes place?this comes in the form of harassing phone calls and some odd, funhouse-mirror-style first-person perspectives?and he's meant to be suspect number one. The elusive psycho's identity is never revealed, and it's clear that screenwriter Roy Moore wants us to believe that Peter is, in fact, the bad guy, but some last-second revelations result in the old switcheroo. This, along with a number of other strategies used in Black Christmas, seem frighteningly clichéd in this day and age, but I can only imagine that they were fairly groundbreaking during their own time (okay, so Psycho is really the movie that spawned the modern slasher, but let's at least give credit to a movie that's notably more tense than most of the horror to emerge from contemporary Hollywood).As previously disclosed, this isn't to say that Black Christmas doesn't have faults. Some of the acting?and corresponding character responses? to what's going on in and around said sorority house are completely unbelievable. The father of a missing sister, for example, calmly explores the campus when his daughter doesn't show-up for a rendezvous they had planned early one afternoon. Even after the police get involved and it's somewhat clear that foul play is afoot, this guy never exhibits any urgent sense of emotion to locate his daughter. There's also the presence of a pointless old woman who, for one inexplicable reason or another, lives in the sorority house. She curses and has liquor stashed in books and septic tanks throughout the home. I'm guessing she was meant to serve as some sort of comic foil, but she's more of an annoyance than anything else.That's Black Christmas in a nutshell. Would I recommend it as a cozy little holiday horror movie? Sure. It's certainly not bad, and it has its creepy moments, but don't expect the reinvention (or invention?) of the wheel.</fullReview>

They are pathetic, in fact! All the way down the line!! Do you hear me?!?! PATHETIC! Indeed though, sure 'twas that it was the case that these gals and guys without exception "didn't have much to work with". In fact I think looking back that aside from Andrea Martin perhaps, all the characters single and in to-to reminded me viscerally of those dimwitted folk who try the patience of detectives Joe Friday and Bill Gannon on "Dragnet" starring Jack Webb forcing the fuzz to raise their eyes to heav'n on numerous occasions so provoked by the half witted dimwitted of LA are they as they go about their "beat" investigating crimes. Not just the good citizens, look you, of this campus town but the peace officers themselves are equally unintelligent leaving it to the audience - you and me - to roll its eyes a la Joe And Bill in this Canadian production entitled, "Black Christmas" but when I saw it in the theater when it originally played I believe it was called "Silent Night, Evil Night". Only with R rating: brace yourself to hear profanity aplenty in this motion picture! Ms. Kidder also does some lewd tongue things. In fact the least nasty of the bunch is probably the heinous killer who has some story to tell about Agnes and Billy which as many other reviewers have indicated, comes off less as an attempt to terrorize than as some little kids intending an attempt to entertain (however feebly!) or kids making "prank" calls and struggling not to laugh as an accompaniment or kids dead set on simply sending "everything but the kitchen sink coming down the line" as one reviewer comprehensively put it.On to accentuating the positive: The color is very richly saturated and the set design and lighting are nothing short of lushhhh, like Barb (Margot Kidder)! As a result, while you'd probably be making a mistake to date any of these sorority sisters, you'll make no mistake dating this picture: this is 1974 all right in all it's glory, with fashion palette ranging from mod to retro and in fact what makes this film really juicy is the heady flavors of '74. Why you can almost hold the aroma in your hand which emanates from the chicks of patchouli, rose oil and from the dudes English Leather, Brut and the like with which you'll be juggling the stench of blood, egg nor, the house mother's "B for Booze" which - charming if hardcore woman that she is, this broad drinks from out the toilet without any kind of rinsing of the bottle I guess she figures if it's a battle to the death between e coli and her saliva she's nothing to worry about with the egg nor, Xmas tree, various other fixings, etc. and the booze the other girls are drinking too, cause the house mother is by no means the only one drawing refreshment from the "tis" punch bowl! Kier Dullea is an evil conservatory composer/pianist whose blatant atonality and extended techniques while one would hope could convey a sense of menace yet even sweating and squirming on the piano which is practically smashing literally to bits during his performance he puts the jury assigned to hear his recital to sleep. Philistines! This movie is so funny cause of its 1974 vintage with all the young women being so potty mouthed, each wanting to be more outrageous and provocative than the last. well at least two or three of them would give any woman a run for her money in a contest for which of them is the sauciest lady of them all, verbally/orally that is. Visually though you may find yourself musing, "I wonder who put up the poster that is the "peace" sign made of the pelvis and legs of a man and woman - the woman's are spread as the man appears to penetrate her from above, his legs tightly clamed together. By today's admittedly different standards it is the female of the species, aside from the "bespectacled" (as the reviewer who spoke of the kitchen sink called her one - i.e. Andrea Martin) one and maybe a couple of the others who bent over more in the direction of soft spoken, who would be charged with sexual harassment in this day and age! Is this a sorority house or a museum of erotic art? The place is, as a rule choka block with knick knacks - carousels, a collection of glass swans, etc. Ah the good old days! Were they so good?!?!?! "Black Christmas" raises this question without doubt.Well for one I was disappointed not even to see a composer credit in the credits for the spicy piano music. The IMDb indicates that the composer recommended sexy John Saxon for the roll of the top cop. Wouldn't it be funny if this composer actually in this instance proved to be the first cause of Mr. Saxon doing the many and various copious cop rolls he was eventually fated to you might say specialize in - let's call it of course a sub-specialty of cop in horror rolls! The last 2 shots were kinda cool. I didn't "get" who it was outside, I guess another ineffectual cop and why he didn't react to the phone ringing!! I'll give it a 10 for being an outstanding "time capsule" cause it really is more interesting in this way than many another bad movie or even good! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrifying masterpiece of the macabre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Christmas break at a sorority house, the girls (Margot Kidder, Olivia Hussey and Andrea Martin) are planning things for Christmas vacation. Until a mysterious stranger makes weird phone calls as he torments the girls then sneaks into the attic of the house as he starts to kill some of the girls one by one. The police are concerned by strange murders going on especially the discovery of a dead 13 year old girl in a park but can the cops find this psychopath or will he have his bloody hands on the entire household? Suspenseful and masterful psychological horror slasher flick from Canada and writer-director Bob Clark who would later give us "Porky's" and "A Christmas Story". It's a true masterpiece of the slasher genre in the 70's with "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Halloween", "Torso" and Mario Bay's "Twitch of The Death Nerve" (a.k.a. Bay of Blood) but this was before "Halloween" hit the screen 4 years later. The film also stars John Saxon who is one of cult cinema's best actors, it's a scary and chilling skin-crawler that will keep you guessing till the very end. Unlike most slasher movies which uses gore, this one uses characterizations and tension rather then just brainless blood-buckets. This is a true underrated horror masterpiece that every horror fan should seek and paved the way for other slasher flicks like "Halloween", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Friday The 13th", "Maniac", "Sleepaway Camp", "The Burning", "Scream" etc. as it ranks up with "Psycho".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Story, just boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a slasher film (this is more like a predecessor to the genre)the film is pretty boring, and the kills are for the most part bloodless and uncreative. The killer, makes prank phones calls to a sorority then kills them off one by one. John Saxon is in there as a cop for some reason but the cops don't seem to exist for any other reason than to pad out the more than ample run time. The end is the slasher genre equivalent to "it was all just a dream". Basically, YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS DOING THE KILLING AND WHY! WTF!? HOW UNSATISFYING CAN YOU GET? Most, at least the entertaining, slasher films have a twist, or a reason, an impetus for the killer's motivations, that's 90% of the story, and why you want to watch. the production values were pretty decent, and the actors all did their parts decently, but with no central thread holding what they're trying to pass off as a story this is a big pass, and only for those who are horror film buff completeists. The viewer has no idea what is motivating the killings, and the characters are so thin, you don't care.When the credits rolled I caught myself thinking, "BOOOOOOOO!, BOOOOOOO!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, if you've read my reviews before, you'd know I love horror films, but this one is sorta boring at some parts. I actually saw the remake of Black Christmas before I saw this, maybe that's why I don't like it as much. In other words, I'm saying I like the remake better than the original. Usually, it's the other way around. It does have some good parts; like the killing scenes, and it has the classic look of the 70's. People are always saying this is the original slasher and HALLOWEEN isn't, but that doesn't matter to me. It doesn't matter which is the original slasher, because I love HALLOWEEN better. Maybe one day, I'll give this movie a 2nd chance. If you love classic slashers, maybe you'll like BLACK Christmas!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This an average horror film, with a good story line. The story doesn't hold up throughout though. It's kind of confusing. Anyway, Olivia Hussey as our main star is super terrific. Margot Kidder as the drunk sorority house sister gets what she deserves. There are some suspenseful scenes which are well done. John Saxon as the lead detective is wonderful as always. The bumbling cop and one of the deceased girl's boyfriends are Porky's alumni, since this film is from the same director. 5/10 Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, here's a picture full of Christmas cheer and the milk of human kindness and all that. It's time to bring up all that turkey you've tried so hard to keep down.Dear me, what have women done to Mr Moore to cause him to write such an impassioned love letter to the great God misogyny? He doesn't like them one bit in this picture and nor, it seems, does Bob Clark, the director. The stabbing scene is a little too long and lovingly composed, you know what I mean? Women are portrayed as drunks, promiscuous, baby killers, foul mouthed, amoral, men hating, jealous, covetous, venal and unprofessional. They are also seemingly deaf, unable to hear a man clambering up a drain pipe which would bring the rest of us outside like a shot. The only virtuous one is dispatched straight away. The rest are stupid. We are led to believe that after being told to leave the house immediately after being informed of the location of the obscene calls our heroine would march right up the stairs.Why is it that the calls always have to be coming from inside the house in these films? Why not surprise us by having them come from the bottom of a swimming pool or a zeppelin? How about the MIR space station? Seeing as it hadn't even been launched during the seventies it would have been quite a plot twist. But no, *yawn* THEY'RE COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE! Dan-Dan. And why is the cop who guards the house always dead in the car? Didn't he notice the very obvious sight of someone jumping down from the side of the house and opening his car door? No, they are hired by the police department for their myopia and narcolepsy and complete lack of professionalism such as failing to search an entire house after they know a killer's been hiding in it. They must be desperate to go and get some turkey, providing they can keep it down, that is.And why do killers always have to have nasal problems? It seems to be a given that any one suffering from any sort of mental illness in films must also have bronchial pneumonia and the stumbling gate of a werewolf with a club foot. So they didn't get what they wanted for Christmas. Go and sulk in the corner of the sofa like the rest of us instead of running up someone else's phone bill and sculking around their house with one eye. The only stranger we want to see coming through the window at Christmas is Santa Clause and even then this guy would probably throttle his reindeer. Sheesh!The nastiness of this film has to be seen to be believed. A man we know has lost his daughter is treated with sadistic contempt by the writer (through a woman, of course.) It's a fascinating reminder of how the medium can be mis-used by those whose sole interest is making money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a good movie, but not a horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed my first viewing of Bob Clark's "Black Christmas" more than my most recent viewing. I still feel that the film is an accomplished piece of work and established a structure and screen language that have been much imitated. The characters are intelligent and screenwriter Roy Moore even takes a shot at the abortion issue.The obscene phone calls made by the killer are truly obscene (much use of the word "c**t"), and his psychotic rants are rather amusing, if not a little disturbing. The killer's POV, which opens the movie, is effective, and the image of a suffocated victim lurking by a window is a memorable one.The film doesn't scare me, though, or make me uneasy. Perhaps I've seen too many horror films. I can't fault Clark for his direction or Carl Zitter for his atmospheric score, more a soundscape than a traditionally structured series of compositions. I simply found the film a bit slow the last time around.Clark's "Deathdream" is one of my favorite horror films of all time (see my review), and it was made before "Christmas". Certainly, "Christmas" is a larger scale production, but, for me, it does not possess the intimacy of "Deathdream" and the sense of crawling horror. It plays more like a mystery than a horror film and lacks the tragedy that made "Deathdream" so effective. Bob Clark may have thought so, too, because "Christmas"'s score sounds exactly like "Deathdream" (same composer), there is a creepy rocking chair (like the one "Andy" used in Deathdream"), and the house exteriors look like the house exteriors in, yes, you guessed it, "Deathdream".Still, a very good movie, but not, for me, a horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm starting to think I saw a totally different movie than almost everyone else who has posted a comment here. I keep reading "best horror movie of all time, and scared the hell out of me". While this movie had it's moments, most of them humorous ones, it will never be on my Top 10 list of scary movies. I'm sure that when Black Christmas first came out it was terrifying, but there are much scarier horror films out there now. The scariest moment in this fairly slow movie was the creepy eye of the killer peering out from the crack of the door. I'll admit that gave me the willies! The gore factor was at zero, and there where some great chances for some good body part shots! The "creepy" psycho voice on the phone only made me giggle like a sorority girl. The scariest thing about Black Christmas was that good actors and performances where wasted on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.... would be a more appropriate name for this thoroughly dull supposed shocker, which rarely rises above indifferent.WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS. ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM.John Saxon and Margot Kidder try gamely with a feeble script that tries to offset it's own predictability by crowbarring in misfiring comic setpieces. Not only do these work against the tone of the piece, they also distract from the main plot. The plot itself is so tedious that we have to wait until the last twenty minutes for the police to work out the killer's been in the house all along... something we were shown from the very beginning. This irritating game of catch-up is only expounded upon by the "twist" ending, which must be obvious even to an amoeba, and a hundred times more obvious to anyone who's seen that particular episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.To make matters worse, when this movie was shown on American TV they changed the name to Stranger In The House. Wow, what a sensible network decision that was! I wonder if the same network changed the name of Citizen Kane to It's His Sled and Planet of the Apes to It's Earth All Along Really, You Know. This is not even to mention the classic character stupidity, with Olivia Hussey being told to leave the house by the police. So does she get out and leave? Guess. People that stupid and annoying deserved to be butchered by an unfrightening mad axeman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to watch this movie many times, but something always had to stop me. Yesterday I finally could see it entirely. From the get go it seems to be an extremely creepy movie, mostly because of the dark version of "Silent Night", but after some moments I could see it wouldn't be that scary. Plot is interesting and sometimes even funny, mainly because of those old people saying such bad words all the time-- come on, old women from a convent aren't supposed to be that rude. What bores me the most is that it took too long for something nice to happen, along with that annoying telephone ringing all the time. However, last scenes are suffocating. That scene with a girl in bed, supposedly sleeping, creeped me out, since ANYTHING could happen to scare the spectator. Happily, directors in that era weren't that mean with us. Surely this film inspired "When a stranger calls" and some others, but it is no big deal after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't understand some of the tremendous reviews this film garnered. Okay on its plus side its beautifully shot, the score is genuinely chilling and the acting is excellent throughout particularly Olivier Hussey and John Saxon - the film also exudes a sense of menace and it ends without having resolved the plot which I like but can imagine putting off some viewers. But the bad points are very bad. Firstly the ridiculous noises coming from the phone were more humorous than scary with everything but the kitchen sink coming down the line. For scary sounds watch the Exorcist. But the worse thing about this movie for me were the murders where the camera breaks away from the scene as soon as the murderer attacks someone. Indeed some murders (such as that of the bespectacled female) were not shown at all. This is poor in the extreme and as a viewer I feel short changed. Its not that I want to see acts of violence - indeed one of the scariest films was 7 where no violence was actually seen being committed - it was only the aftermath that was shown on screen but it worked beautifully and warranted an adult rating but this film could quiet easily have been given a PG certificate. It was that spineless and certainly wasn't adult entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard a little bit about Black Christmas a couple years ago when I was watching on TV the scariest movies of all time, Black Christmas wasn't high on the list, but it was in there, and I remember looking at some of the clips they showed and I was completely scared. They also remade the movie and I was curious to see the original first before I saw the remake, the strange thing is when I watched this movie, it sent chills down my spine. Normally most horror movies don't do that, it'll get you scared, but don't get to you like Black Christmas did, this movie just gave me everything I could want from a horror film. Those calls were just so beyond creepy, the voice, you knew what was coming to these girls for the holidays and it wasn't going to be peace on Earth. My only problem with this movie... "Whatever you do... DON'T GO UP THOSE STAIRS!" said by a policeman, what does the girl do? Oh, she goes upstairs, but I guess we wouldn't have a movie if she did the sensible thing.Some sorority girls are spending their Christmas vacation at the house and are just going to enjoy the holidays together. But after some disturbing phone calls with men heavily breathing, making foul sexual suggestions, and even involving blood curdling screams, the girls have a bit of a scare when the mysterious stranger won't stop calling. Something else has happened, one of the sisters has gone missing, when the girls along with some of their friends try to figure out how these calls and the disappearances of other sorority sisters, the might not want to know where the call is coming from.Black Christmas is a classic and should definitely be watched in the dark, this movie just had me scared and wanting more. It makes you wanna just stay in your room and unplug the phone, we all get prank phone calls at least once, but this is our worst nightmare is when those calls are just more than a mear threat. Olivia Hussy was a great selection, I've only seen her in Romeo and Juliet and the TV mini series IT, I didn't know as a teen she could be so great for a horror movie. Like I said there are some cliché's that I was a little angry with, but this movie does deliver some good scares and will not disappoint you, it's a true sleepover classic.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine '70's genre movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not a movie with a great or original story (which horror movie does anyway?) or approach but this is simply one fine and effective genre movie, with a fine premise, good settings and some wonderful genre moments.Amazing thing is that director Bob Clark started his career with movies like this but soon continued on making movies such as "Porky's" and "Baby Geniuses", which is obviously a totally different genre. A waste of his talent? Well, in all honesty horror movies from the '70's are definitely better ones than the ones from the '80's of '90's, so I'm not too sure about it actually if Clark would had continued to direct horror movies during his later career those movies would had been as good as this one, mostly in terms of style.'70's movies of course have a very distinctive style and atmosphere. Some of the best and most classic horror movies also date back from the '70's. Movies such as "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "Don't Look Now", "Halloween" oh and I can just go on and on. This movie wasn't the first slasher and it also wasn't the most influential or best known one (credit for that still mostly goes to John Carpenter's "Halloween") but it's nevertheless obvious that this movie inspired later film-makers and is a fine example of the genre from the '70's.It's a really effective horror movie, that features all of the right required ingredients. It doesn't make this the most original genre movie with its style or approach but it's simply one fine executed one. The movie has a good dark and mysterious atmosphere and it also really knows to be scary in parts. Especially the phone calls within the movie, which play a key part, are really scary. I don't know what it is but phone calls are always scary and effective material for horror movies. Just think about movies such as "Scream", "When a Stranger Calls" or "Sorry, Wrong Number".What also helps the movie is its atmospheric musical score from Carl Zittrer, who used to work a lot with Bob Clark during his career.The movie also really has a great cast with actors you wouldn't necessarily normally expect in a genre movie such as this one. Margot Kidder is really great in this movie, in a fairly early role from her. The movie also stars Keir Dullea, who unfortunately doesn't ever star in that many movies.A great movie for the fans of the genre, as well as to everyone else for all that matter.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Lot Better than the Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 98-minute film is a stark and stylish horror/thriller that turns everyone's favorite time of the year inside out. Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder star among an ill-fated houseful of sorority sisters celebrating the holiday season. Festivities turn fatal when obscene phone calls break the serenity and it becomes clear that a psychopath is stalking the house.Instead of watching this movie first, I watched the remake of it, which was horrible. Watching this, I was surprised how many small body counts there are compared to the remake but I wasn't surprised it was less bloody, which is a good thing. The violence, which was the problem in the remake, does not turn you off.What I like about this movie is that it focuses more on the characters than the kills. I love the characters, including Marian Waldman and Margot Kidder, both who seem to have a good time giving us plenty of laughs. I also like Olivia Hussey's performance.Yeah, there are some clichés here but it was made in the past, okay? I didn't mind the generic ending, which is used in most horror movies these days. What I also like in here is the suspense. There are some scenes that really scares you.I'm sure this movie is underrated and should be better than it is today. It's a good horror movie if you want a fun and scary time. It's not a masterpiece in anyway but it's better than most horror movies, even the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slasher film? Nuh-uh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but this is NOT a slasher film. Where was the gore? The blood? The decapitations? "Black Christmas" doesn't even belong in the horror section -- it should be moved to suspense/thriller. I realise we all have different likes and dislikes, and as a major horror buff, this didn't really match my likes. It had the potential to be a great film. The casting was good, the storyline was okay, and the camera-work was fabulous, but it just didn't work.To start with, the film doesn't have the timeless quality that makes a true slash flick, or even a horror. In 1974 this movie was scary, but even by the time I first saw it (1981), horror (and in particular slasher) had been sculpted and re-done with the two "Halloween" movies, and even a couple of the Jason Voorhies flicks. "Black Christmas" tries to imitate the true slasher king, "Psycho", in its picture scenes and mystery, but the conclusion of the movie misses the mark by a mile. I won't ruin it for others, but I will say this -- if you aren't extremely disappointed, you didn't get the movie.As long as you're not expecting a horror flick, you won't be that disappointed. Basically, it's not a half bad movie, but it's certainly not that scary. Tim Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas" is far scarier than this one. 4 out of 10, and that's only for the incomparable Olivia Hussey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Black Christmas" is a pretty disappointing proto-slasher.**SPOILERS**Gathering for a Christmas party, Jess Bradford, (Olivia Hussey) Barbara Coard, (Margot Kidder) Phyllis Carlson, (Andrea Martin) and Claire Harrison, (Lynne Griffin) along with Mrs. MacHenry, (Marian Waldman) all prepare for their Sorority party. As the night goes on, they are continued to be inundated with a series of obscene phone calls that many say have been going on for awhile. As they take place, they also find that some of the other sorority members have gone missing, and pleading with Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller, (John Saxon) does nothing as he claims to be more prioritized with another case. Forced back in the sorority house as there's nothing the police can do, the calls continue and the others disappear, making the others realize that there's something wrong with the calls. Checking back in with the police, they realize that there's a killer in the house and try to get out before they encounter him.The Good News: There wasn't a whole lot to this one, as it was surprisingly disappointing. The main source this one gets right is the mystery of the killer. We never see the killer's face aside from a hand and a spastic looking eyeball. We never learn the killer's true motives or identity, or why he decided to plague this particular sorority house. That is just eerie and really makes the killer a lot more fearsome when the identity remains a secret. The film does a spectacular job of making the killer feel really threatening without doing a whole lot. Even more important is that, early in the film, the killer establishes a trademark method of operation, which is maintained rather faithfully throughout the movie. Immediately after dispatching a victim, he immediately places an obscene phone call to the house. That works wonders, especially when it's revealed that this has been going on prior to the beginning of the film. During the first phone call, one remarks that it's the moaner again the, meaning that he has called before. This fits with the later fact that several townspeople have been raped on the college campus during the recent weeks. There's also the fact that the killer starts toying with them in incredibly perverse ways and the tormenting gets more and more vulgar as time goes on. That allows for more fear from the killer, and all of the calls actually go a long way; as well as the other tactics, to make the killer something to be feared. When it switches over to the later calls, it gets even more disturbing and even more furious. From this point on, the caller exhibits obvious symptoms of multiple-personality-disorder, and we hear him switching between three different voices within the course of one call, often times the different voices even overlap one another. It's a neat trick, and again goes even further towards making the killer the ultimate creep. From the moments where just the POV is seen running across the landscape with just the breathing voice heard to the sense of humor displayed with the strangulation gag that comes from the simply mind-blowing original finale, the killer here is one of the best in the genre. A couple of the attacks are pretty cool as well, especially the bedroom one where the screams are drowned out by the caroling group downstairs as well as one where a victim is lured in and attacked with a giant pulley system. These here provide the film's only good points.The Bad News: This one here wasn't all that impressive, with it's laurels really resting on a couple of areas. This one has such a dull and boring middle section that most of the problems are found here. The film decides to stack in as many different scenes and subplots in here to stretch the film out that after a while it gets incredibly dull and boring. From the pregnancy subplot that has nothing to do at all with any of the film's proceedings once it's given to the missing towns-person going missing along with the search by the police, this film is super padded out to ridiculous lengths. These take up a large amount of the film's time to take in with certain areas of the plots that contain nothing of importance in the final count. There's also the fact that this one is a complete mystery surrounding the killer. While it's nice to finally get a mystery, not even being sure of the killer's name is taking it a bit too far. This occurs in a conversation as a line that the person on the other end spouts, yet nothing is confirmed as to whether it's the actual name or whether it's a person who caused the psycho to go homicidal. Other names are dropped in the course of the conversations, but again, not even having something as simplistic as a name is a big shame in the film. Other factors in here, from the reasoning behind the rampage to the motive of selecting this particular sorority, manage to force into the viewer such a state of confusion that there's a really volley of emotions over being scared and annoyed over the killer. The fact that a lot of questionable tactics are put into play over what he tries to do with them or not is another big factor with this one, and in the end, this one ends up feeling very disappointing.The Final Verdict: With a lot of dull moments in this one and a couple of somewhat decent moments, this one comes across as a merely disappointing effort. This is one really for those who have a big fascination with the early-going slashers or are into the film's positives, while those who prefer faster-paced fare should seek caution.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Primary slasher film? I don't think so, Mr. Clark. "Black Christmas" had the potential to be as well-done as the ultimate in slasher/stalker films, 1960's "Psycho", but it fell short of it's mark with a weak, fairly non-existent ending. The build-up in the movie is well-done, with very little of the nudity and gore that marks the modern-day horror film, but the plot is full of holes, and the theory very lukewarm.Where this movie does excel is in the casting and acting. Olivia Hussey, probably best known for being the nude Juliet in the 1968 version of "Romeo &amp; Juliet", brings her character to life in her portrayal. Hussey is always a treat to watch, as she is one of the most talented actresses to hit the screen in years, but her "Black Christmas" role falls shy when compared to her role in the 1979 remake of "The Cat and the Canary". Even her roles in the fourth installment of the "Psycho" series, and Stephen King's televised "It" were better written than this particular role.This movie made a name for itself in the mid-seventies with the abortion storyline, which is one of the many reasons it still survives to this day. No, it's not the worst movie ever made, but to call this movie a "slasher" film is grossly inaccurate. The focal point of a slasher film isn't the blood and gore (a requirement), but the ending, which should leave the viewer feeling vindicated. Me, I got up and changed the channel. A 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent (But Kind Of Dull) Mid-70's Slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before everyone comes gunning for me for my relatively low review of this "classic" slasher - let me start by embarrassing myself by admitting that although I consider myself knowledgeable in most things horror-related - this is one of the classic films that I just watched recently...by recently I mean last night. I know, I know...how could this be, how can you be a "true horror fan", blah, blah, blah - well kiss my ass, I just never got around to this one (or tons of others that I'm now making an effort to go back and revisit...). So with that out of the way, I'll give you my honest opinion...BLACK Christmas is not a bad film by any means. It definitely deserves it's place as a classic slasher film. But, with all of the similar films that I HAVE seen, although BLACK Christmas is obviously one of the originators, it's still like many of the other films I've seen in the slasher genre - and personally the 70's-80's slasher films are not among my favorite of the horror-genre overall. I prefer the more exploitative films of that time frame as opposed to the suspenseful horror films of the time - so my mid-grade rating of this film is based strictly on my own personal opinion...The long and short of this one is about a psycho that sneaks into a girls dorm and starts making obscene phone calls and picking off the "tenents" one-by-one. That's pretty much it.Not necessarily a bad premise - I've seen films work with a lot less, but like I said before, there's not much in BLACK Christmas that I haven't seen before. There is a noticeable lack of gore, which is another gripe of mine with the slasher films of this time-frame (yes, I'm one of those...) and the film dragged in a lot of places. Anyone who is into the classic slashers should definitely check this one out, but I personally just didn't find it as "scary" or enthralling as most others - sorry... 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why a lot of people like this film. I didn't think it was all that great. Also known as SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT, directed by Bob Clark of PORKY'S fame, this one involves psychotic killer who hides in the attic of a sorority house and starts killing off all the "girls", one by one. I say "girls" because most of them look over 30 instead of 20, especially Margot Kidder as the slutty one with the foul mouth. (Check out Brian DePalma's SISTERS if you want to see Kidder in a terrifying role)The film does just fine until the last 15 minutes or so when Olivia Hussey goes upstairs to look for her friends and doesn't follow police instructions to leave the house. What a dumb bitch. Anybody who is THAT dumb deserves to be killed.It's also pretty obvious 40 minutes into the film who the killer is, but director Clark tries to pull a fast one at the very end of the film by implying that it's not him. It looks like Clark wants to have it both ways, casting doubt upon the whole thing and trying to leave it open-ended like he does. There's no gore being shown and very little blood, making the whole thing look pretty tame by today's standards. In fact, the only thing missing is the ax-wielding Santa. But no matter folks, that'll come in a later film.The Critical Mass DVD has filmographies for most of the cast along with a short, uninformative interview with Saxon that doesn't reveal much of anything, and no extras from Bob Clark. At least not in the DVD version I saw. Maybe Clark was embarrassed by the whole thing, who knows? He should be.3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Because It's Old Doesn't Mean It's a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And if you happen to run across scores and scores of accounts here at the IMDb praising this film please keep in mind there are thousands of copies of this boring old movie deservedly gathering dust. A lot of salesmen work the messge boards. It's not 'the original slasher movie'. Body count films were old news by 1974. This cheap Canadian cult item didn't even reach a broad audience until the 80s slasher craze was well under way. Then it was shown on American TV under a different non-seasonal title. If you like to watch dull 40 year old horror movies, best of luck with this one. At least it's not nearly as pretentious the people who endorse it or worse: call it a classic. From the makers of Porky's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little dated, but still better than 60% of horror films released lately.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time a remake is released (which is almost every week) these days I feel more compelled to seek out the source material to see why it needed remaking in the first place, as in 90% of cases the remake is worse or just as lousy as the original.I never saw the remake of Black Christmas, it looked altogether too teen-y for me and I'm not a big slasher flick fan anyway. But I did read something that said that it was a remake of perhaps the first slasher flick, which at least piqued my interest as it is always interesting to see where certain genres originated.After viewing what is immediately evident is that 35 odd years ago it was apparently unsettling enough to simply set up the kill and then have the killer do the rest. There are no intricate 7 minute "creeping through the halls" or red herring scares here, the victims decide to do something, enter the room in which they will do that thing, and the killer does the rest quickly and in straightforward fashion.Nowadays to achieve the same result the filmmakers have to build the tension or ramp up the gore, guess which one they normally go for ('eh Eli?).The supposed big twist (copied by Scream) is actually made evident in the very opening scene, as we are introduced to "Stalker-Cam" (TM) as someone cases a house from the outside, while a party seems to be going on inside. Said individual then climbs up and into the attic of the house.It turns out we are in what I think they call a frat-house in the US, a communal dorm for students, in this case all female with a middle aged, seemingly alcoholic dorm mother.The girls are having an end of term party before either heading home or settling in for the Christmas holidays. The party is interrupted by an obscene phone call, as the girls are all in their late teens / early 20s they put the phone on speaker and have a chuckle. Of course some are offended and others get into the swing of things and actually try to talk back to the caller, but ultimately no harm is done and they hang up, thinking that's that.Seeing as the film doesn't waste time in building tension or suspense, we get a fair bit of time spent getting to know the individual girls, there are no cardboard cut-outs here (I'm talking to you Friday the 13th remake!), there are drunken sluts, naive young women and other normal girls, same as every group of students. They are beset by the usual circumstances that occur to the age group, horny suitors, teenage pregnancy, busybody adults and the allure of alcohol and mischief.When quite suddenly (to them at least) a member of their number goes missing, they don't just shrug it off as so many crappy horror movies do today by saying "Oh, she must have gone to the shops" or "She'll show up", they treat the disappearance seriously, and as they care for their missing friend so too does the audience care more.The crank calls keep coming and they keep getting more and more disturbing, I would question why the girls keep listening but it is a movie after all. In between a small collection of bodies builds up, again this isn't a 73 dead slash fest as many are today and the remaining girls come across all sorts of roadblocks when trying to solve the issue, not the least of which is incompetent police work.When the ending comes it is in keeping with the rest of the flick, straightforward and basic, and there is no realllll surprise unless you have never ever seen a horror film in your life. What would concern though is the outrageously terrible police investigation that follows that wraps everything up so nicely whilst ignoring so many events and incidents.Again, this was the 70s, maybe they just didn't care too much back then about the details.Final Rating ? 7 / 10. You aren't going to see anything new, but I'd rather watch this than most big budget horror remakes churned out these days.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not scary, but disturbing and entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>after watching black Christmas,i have to say it wasn't scary,so much as disturbing.sort of along the line of the original when a stranger calls,except in a sorority house.in fact when a stranger calls came out five years later and almost certainly borrowed its premise from black Christmas,though it was less entertaining and not as well done.black Christmas also had some humour in it,mainly in the form of the sorority house mother mrs mac,played by marian waldman,who had more than a bit of a drinking problem and was very liberal in her use of questionable language.also providing some humour was margot kidder, who played barbi,one of the sorority sisters.the characters in black Christmas were not as developed as they could have been,but from what we are shown of them,they are likable.this movie was entertaining, though as i said not,scary and not overly suspenseful.in fact it could have worked equally well as simply a drama.there is some very course language in the form of the psychopath,so if you are easily offended by very foul language,you won't like this movie.otherwise you could do a lot worse with your time .if you enjoy or have enjoyed black Christmas, then you should check out the 2006 remake of when a stranger calls,which is far superior to the original.as for black Christmas, 6* out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsatisfying and overrated ............</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations for "Black Christmas" were high, but somehow the film just doesn't deliver. The atmosphere is creepy and builds tension, the characters are developed, there is even a marginal attempt at humor, but ultimately I was disappointed. My biggest objection is the unresolved ending. I realize this begs for a sequel, but the story is so simple, that a second film really has nowhere to go. Another problem is the movie is very claustrophobic, with the camera constantly tracking the unseen killer throughout the sorority house. John Saxon seems wasted and his screen time insufficient. "Black Christmas" would make a superior short, but at 98 minutes, it is way too long for such slight material. - MERK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler... They say this film influenced others; well it is average by today's standards. This film builds great tension but is dated and laps over periods of time. The relentless tension build up is what makes this movie. The scare factor is very tame, and predictable for today's standards. Plot twists, this is before call trace and shows the age of this film, where they have to wait to trace the caller and find out he is calling from the house. I could see this one coming right from the get go. The comic relief is awful, the 70's must have been the I don't care rude and crude generation that reflects today's social decay. The swearing, perverseness, drinking, and rude comments had a shock humor element then, but in today's Jenny Jones, Jerry Springer society make one's eyes roll. It seems in that era of filming everyone has to yell, for many of us who work customer service just find it idiotic, not funny, or even amusing. (explains why so many disgruntled customers have the 70's styled mustaches, leather vests and boots). I work at the Post Office and see this daily, and with my experiences with unbalanced people I find the caller's messages scary. They must have experience with these phone calls or studied mental illnesses. The caller rants, rambles, repeats himself, and goes on a senseless tangent. A different sense of reality. Everyone in this film has a problem, the drinking bit is too much, and builds little character development. The unbalanced boyfriend ending, and the cops too stupid to check the rest of the house is a little too much. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad slasher film (though there is precious little slashing shown). Director Bob Clark creates an occasionally eerie film starring Olivia Hussey as a college girl whose sorority sisters are being bumped off by a lunatic. The crazed killer enjoys making increasingly bizarre crank calls after each slaying. Needless to say, Hussey (nor anyone else) catches on to what's happening. It's creepy, features a lot of haunting images and Hussey is terrific. Among those playing sorority girls are 26-year old Margot Kidder &amp; 27-year old Andrea Martin. Kidder is the foul-mouthed drunkard while a pre-SCTV Martin is the Earth mother. Keir Dullea &amp; John Saxon are in it too as is Marian Waldman, who adds a lot of kick as the soused house mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good, but it's no 'Halloween'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Canadian director Bob Clark's Black Christmas (1974) gets a lot of love these days from many horror fans who cite it as the inspiration for John Carpenter's classic, Halloween, and some even claim it to be the original slasher film?the one that started the sub-genre that spawned not just Michael Myers but countless other masked maniacs. Whilst I am not in total agreement with them (Mario Bava's Bay Of Blood, for example, follows the body count style of the genre and was made in 1971), I do agree that this film must have been highly influential on Mr.Carpenter, who obviously modelled some of his film's scenes on Black Christmas's best moments (although Halloween is still the superior movie, in my humble opinion).Clark sets his seminal shocker in a sorority house during the Christmas holidays, where a group of young women are killed one by one by a crazy, ranting maniac who has also been scaring them with a series of sick telephone calls. Starring Keir Dullea, Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and cult movie favourite John Saxon, the film has no shortage of talent in the acting department, and Clark delivers quite a few stylish directorial flourishes that really help to crank up the tension.From the get go, Black Christmas introduces plot elements and visual techniques that were to become a staple of stalk 'n' slash movies for years to come: creepy POV shots; the careful framing of shots to reveal movement in the background; the killer's heavy breathing on the soundtrack; the final victim frantically fleeing from the maniac (after having discovered the mutilated bodies of her friends). We also get to see where When A Stranger Calls (1979) got its 'We've traced the call... it's coming from inside the house' moment from?the exact same thing occurs in Black Christmas!Also particularly effective are the telephone calls made by the maniac; a mixture of unintelligible ranting, guttural moans, violent threats and crude obscenities, they are very unsettling and help convey exactly how demented the (unseen) murderer truly is. Another factor that adds to the creepy vibe of the film is the fact that we never get to find out who the killer is or why he is attacking these seemingly innocent girls. Even at the end, Clark gives nothing away about his identity. By not giving us any background details, or any motivation for his actions, he turns the killer into a 'bogeyman' (another idea borrowed by Carpenter for his movie).Unfortunately, there are also several things that let the film down slightly.Firstly, there is a lack of any really likable characters: Hussey's heroine is rather selfish, Kidder's character is a loud mouthed drunk, and Dullea plays a rather dull and obsessive pianist. Worst of all is the drunken house mother, a nasty woman who thankfully meets a suitably violent end. At least Carpenter had the good sense to make some of his victims a little more likable, thus actually making the audience give a damn about whether they lived or not.Clark also neglects to put in any real scares; creepiness the film has in spades, but genuine shocks are in short supply. And with the few deaths being rather bloodless, the 'yuck' factor is also kept fairly low (unless you find endless shots of a body with a plastic bag over its head particularly nauseating).Lastly, Clark tries to inject some humour into the proceedings, but fails spectacularly: Kidder's weak prank about fellatio is desperately unfunny and the drunken house mother's search for booze is truly cringe-worthy.Black Christmas is a film that all horror fans should see, since it helped to define a whole horror sub-genre, but to say it is better than Halloween is definitely going a step too far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another overrated but this time decent little serial killer flick surrounding girls in a sorority. Margot Kidder is great and this production features "Audra" from Stephen King's made For TV movie, "IT." While this is somewhat entertaining, the direction was horrible, and it is easily one of the most clichéd horrors I've seen.It was not scary, and while it tries to build suspense, the liquor-filled sorority house mother relieved any suspense built, by her antics. There are some really creepy (and humorous) elements in this one, making it better than some, but frankly, I don't see why this film is considered to be a benchmark of the horror genre. It really is not anything special. It is just a mediocre thriller, nothing more. I honestly thought Scream was better. *LOL*3.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BLACK Christmas (1974)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read quite a few reviews of BLACK Christmas (1974) before purchasing it, never having watched the film before. I certainly felt elated afterwards that it was very much worth picking up. I am saying this because, having grown up on Alan Frank's book HORROR MOVIES - in which this was not mentioned at all! - I didn't quite know what to expect. It's certainly one of the finest 'slasher' films I have ever watched, not that I can say I'm a rabid fan of this sub-genre.As with most of the landmark horror films of the 1970s, BLACK Christmas was a low-budget production but the film is very well-made and this factor never becomes a problem. The screenplay by Roy Moore was fairly original for its time, though it's since been copied ad nauseam: the mostly young cast does extremely well here - it helps that many were professional actors, making the audience care for the characters' fate - which cannot be said for virtually any of its contemporaries (not even John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN [1978]). Again, it skilfully integrates generous doses of humor to offset the generally high-strung and claustrophobic mood. Tension is admirably built-up and sustained throughout, particularly during the last half-hour. The murder scenes, though not too many in number, are certainly very effective - and thankfully done without the need for extensive use of gore.Technically, the film is also well up to par: Reg Morris' cinematography superbly captures the sinister atmosphere of the house making it a major character in the proceedings, as well as the killer's state of mind through a frequent use of the subjective camera. Expert editing keeps the audience on edge throughout, but it is at its most effective during Margot Kidder's death scene (a veritable Argento moment) and the finale. Carl Zittrer's unusual and largely dissonant score is very unsettling, and another big plus. The killer's attitude reminded me a bit of Andy Robinson's psycho in DIRTY HARRY (1971), and the weird and pretty haunting sounds he makes (the girls themselves dub him 'The Moaner') were probably inspired by Mercedes McCambridge's demon voice in THE EXORCIST (1973) - but they are even more impressive, and scary, for not showing the person making them!The comedy element of this film is worth a special mention: from the posters hung up on the walls of the sorority to Marian Waldman's boozy antics as the contemptuous house mother to Margot Kidder's turtle anecdote during a party and her 'telephone exchange' scene at the Police Station (which, later on, is also beset by a trigger-happy old man who literally shoots one of the officers in the ass!), the film is quite hilarious at times - which, in a film of its type, is not easy to come across and even harder to pull off! Still, BLACK Christmas' most memorable comic foil is Douglas McGrath playing a baffled cop put upon by just about everyone, including his own colleagues and superiors; these scenes are far better handled than the sorry attempts at comedy in Wes Craven's THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972), that's for sure!The leading roles are nicely filled: Olivia Hussey projects more than just beauty as the strong-willed heroine; Keir Dullea essays his relatively difficult role admirably; Margot Kidder is impressive in what she has to do, and probably influenced her later casting as Lois Lane in SUPERMAN - THE MOVIE (1978); John Saxon is suitably commanding as the Police Lieutenant intent on capturing the madman. If there is one thing about the film which I find unsatisfying is the lack of sufficient clarity in the killer's backstory (reminding me of Dario Argento's OPERA [1987] which I have only watched for the first time a couple of weeks ago). I know this was probably done on purpose but, usually in this type of film, all the plot threads are neatly woven by the end - whereas here we rather emerge from the whole enthralling ordeal (echoed, to a certain extent, by HALLOWEEN's conclusion) none the wiser!Much has been said of the film's Original Aspect Ratio. The end titles clearly give this as being shot in Panavision, so I don't know why anyone would prefer to watch it 'full frame'. Actually, once I had watched it I couldn't envision the film in this way, and sure enough the scenes that appear in the documentary are not as effective for this very reason! The DVD supplements are extensive but, all in all, something of a mixed bag: the two Audio Commentaries are very interesting, even though quite a bit of info is repeated verbatim elsewhere on the disc - also, Bob Clark's track (which is fuller than the John Saxon/Keir Dullea one) quite often suffers from poor audio making his comments hard to understand; the three interview segments, two of them with Saxon and another one with Clark, deal with the rest of their work as well as their obvious fondness for BLACK Christmas; though it basically covers all grounds, the documentary disappoints slightly due to the amateurishness of its production (it certainly pales in comparison with Blue Underground's or Laurent Bouzereau's efforts which grace numerous DVD editions of classic films) - still, my favorite bit is the greatly moving anecdote involving Edmond O'Brien's failing health which prevented him from taking the role later filled by John Saxon; numerous trailers and radio spots (narrated by a familiar voice later to play a prominent part in Clark's MURDER BY DECREE [1978]) are great fun, as is the photo gallery which features a good selection of stills, posters and behind-the-scenes shots; finally, the alternate credit sequences and reversible cover art are nice to have, too.The disc also includes a special preview of MURDER BY DECREE by way of its theatrical trailer (which, apparently, is in pretty bad shape!), announcing it to be coming soon on Critical Mass DVD. Does anyone have any idea when this will be released and what supplements will be included - the film is certainly intriguing and Anchor Bay's DVD (that was only released in January) seems to be quite satisfactory, but who knows if it could be improved?Having watched BLACK Christmas, I'm certainly interested in catching up with other Bob Clark horror films, particularly his two earlier efforts - CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS (1972; coming soon on R2 DVD from Anchor Bay UK) and DEATHDREAM (1972; aka: DEAD OF NIGHT).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas is set in a girls sorority house around Christmas, one of the girls Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) is spending the festive season with her father at home but is brutally killed in her room before she meets up with him. The next morning &amp; her dad (James Edmond) raises the alarm &amp; contacts the police who organise a search where they find the dead body of a young child, meanwhile the sorority house has been receiving obscene phone calls which they tell the police about. Lieutenant Fuller (John Saxon) decides all the clues point the the sorority house with very good reason as there's a killer on the loose inside...This Canadian production was produced &amp; directed by Bob Clark &amp; I have to say I think Black Christmas is vastly overrated, considered by some to be the very first slasher film ever made I'd personally say it's more of a thriller although I can see why some would say that. The script by Ray Moore is very serious &amp; tries to build tension up &amp; remain quite taught but I have to say I was pretty bored by it. It takes ages to do anything &amp; then we get the god awful ending, some people complain about horror films not having much of a story &amp; Black Christmas would almost certainly give those people more ammunition as the killer is never seen, the killer's motives are never revealed neither is the basic question of who he is. I'm sorry but even Jason Voorhees &amp; Freddy Kruger had back stories, at least they had some sort of motive no matter how flimsy it was while here in Black Christmas there is nothing. Some may like the ambiguity &amp; sure it works well enough for most of the film but I'd have liked some sort of pay-off, some sort of explanation, some sort of twist, some sort of story behind the killer &amp; a proper ending, you see Black Christmas doesn't so much as end as just stops. On the plus the plus side it's watchable, the character's are good &amp; more human than in a lot of horror films although for me that's just not enough to want to sit through 100 minutes of this again.Since it was Chritsmas Day only a few days ago Black Christmas was an appropriate film to sit down &amp; watch last night &amp; director Clark does a really good job here &amp; the films best asset is it's atmosphere &amp; style, there are some great point-of-view shots from the killer's perspective &amp; there's definitely a creepy chilly atmosphere to it. The film looks quite gritty &amp; is far less glossy than the average Hollywood flick which helps it as well but despite some good visuals &amp; a nice dark atmosphere I still didn't like the story &amp; that's what really sinks Black Christmas for me. The body count is low &amp; there's absolutely zero gore. Was it just me or did anyone else have problems understanding the obscene phone calls? I mean the guy speaking sounding like he was doing a bad Donald Duck impression! The ending doesn't work either on a factual level, the cops wouldn't leave Jessica alone in the house after what she had just gone through &amp; considering what had just taken place they wouldn't have left the house anyway let alone not even bother searching the attic.Technically the film is well made &amp; is pretty impressive, shot on location in Toronto, Ontario in Canada. The acting is fine, the likes of Kier Dullea, Ovlia Hussey, Margot Kidder &amp; genre favourite John Saxon put in good performances.Black Christmas is considered by some to be the very first slasher film ever made which I can see why while other's claim it's the best slasher ever made which I can't agree with at all as I think it's one of the most overrated, I'm not saying it's a bad film by any stretch of the imagination it's just one that I personally didn't like &amp; can't see why so many people do despite their reasoning. Remade by Hollywood as Black Christmas (2006) which I actually prefer as it has more of a story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the time it was released, this 'Black Christmas' must be regarded as slightly more important than your average slasher in which gorgeous sorority babes are being exterminated. Black Christmas is a trendsetter, opening the gates for Michael Myerses and Jason Vorheeses who'll only be popular several years later. The plot is as simple as it ever was?but here, it's new and even rather courageous! Lovely looking girls harassed by obscene phone calls and stalked by a familiar killer. Imaginatively timed around the holiday-season when the university babes are in a party mood and packing to spend Christmas with their families. Producer-director Bob Clark (who regretfully continued his career with horny adolescent crap like 'Porky's') uses many horror-clichés for the first time here: dumb cops, scream-queens, the isolated location of a fraternity house and the different stereotype-categories of female students. And ? most of all ? Black Christmas contains an old-fashioned scariness, still efficient even by today's horror standards. Finally, there still is room for comical undertones and good acting. The eminent John Saxon, but also the beautiful looking Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane!!!) Horror fans can't afford themselves to skip this one. Black Christmas is a modest milestone in the field of scary cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas (1974) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Bob Clark's cult classic about a maniac terrorizing girls at a sorority house. There's no doubt this is the film that started all the 'stalk and slash' films and it's clear to see this film's influence on Halloween and while I respect this film a lot I really can't say I enjoyed all of it. There are some really great moments scattered throughout the film but at the same time I feel there are some pretty slow moments. The greatest thing is the terrific atmosphere that Clark's able to build from the terrific opening scene. I liked that fact that Clark went for atmosphere over gore and the final thirty minutes are full of suspense. The problem I have is the first hour, which is just too slow for me. I don't mind a slowly paced film but I thought everything dealing with the search of the missing girl really took away from what was important and that was the killer and the phone calls. The performances are better than average and of course there's John Saxon who's always worth watching. Again, the film has a lot of respect from me but there needed to be a few more changes to make it real good.</fullReview>
