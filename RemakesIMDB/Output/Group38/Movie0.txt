		<shortDescription>enjoy, but don't take seriously!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earlier this year, I tore the re-make of When A Stranger Calls apart, and said at the time, that if Hollywood won't bother making new horror movies, but instead simply re-make old or foreign ones, then just stop. I stand by that.However...Black Christmas actually surprised me. First, it was actually a lot more brutal and violent than I was expecting, considering it's 15 rating (UK). The other, was the way it re-worked the original.The original, which I haven't seen for awhile was as much a whodunit as anything else. Here we're spared that. We know pretty much from the start who is killing here.What the makers have done, is simply turn the story into a stalk and slash movie, which as I said is quite brutal in areas. For me a movie of this type stands or falls not on the killer or how they kill, but on the potential victims in the story. If you care about them, then you feel bad they are killed. If you don't, then give me an axe, I'll do it myself!! Black Christmas does enough to make you care about each character, by making each one a little different, but yet, having enough in character to make you believe they could get along normally. So when the killing starts, you do care about them, and begin to wonder who, or how many will make it to the end alive.The death scenes are well set up and done, which isn't surprising considering the makers also did Final Destination 1 &amp; 3. If I have a problem with them is that the film is maybe a little over-edited so at times, you aren't sure if certain characters have been killed or not.This movie has been getting a critical mauling in certain areas. But I found on watching it, that it's fun, enjoyable, with a black(!) sense of humour, some very nice looking actresses in it!, and for it's (admittedly short) running time very entertaining. And when I go to see a movie like this, that's what I want.Enjoyable late-night fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another VERY disappointing "Re-make"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had very high expectations for this film. I thought that this might be the one "Re-make" that is the exception because of the involvement of the original film maker, Bob Clark, serving as assistant producer. BOY was I wrong!!! There are some exceptional murder sequences in this flick but that is not enough. Once again, as is the case in so many "Re-makes" the storyline has been almost completely changed! The producers do not seem to realize the elements that made the original film scary in the first place which are now missing! Such as the fact that, in the original you were never quite sure who the killer was and they never revealed it. Now not only do they reveal it, but they add an entire background that is so laughably unbelievable that it dilutes the film's ability to frighten the viewer. The over-the-top gore sequences alone do not make for a frightening movie and the "twist" ending is quite laughable! What they add to the ending of this movie is utterly ridiculous and absolutely unnecessary! Aside from exceptional gore effects, the only other saving grace is the presence of Andrea Martin from the original film as Mrs. Mack but they should have really tried harder to make the characters from the original more like those in the original...and the phone calls, a crucial element to the terrifying experience of the original, are absolutely laughable! Skip this one and watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So it's not the original...but there's plenty of fun to be had here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I will get heat for having enjoyed Black Christmas 2006. Hell, I can't really even call this a "good" movie. It is severely flawed in many ways, and it's not even closely comparable to the original. Monster holes are present in the story line. The cinematography at times is choppy, dark, and grainy. And, most of all, there is ZERO suspense. How can a movie with such negativity possibly get a 7 out of 10?Well, technical goofs aside, there is a lot of fun to be had here! It has a completely different atmosphere and tone than the original had, as well as a completely different approach at it's villain. For one, the violence and murders in the 2006 version are much gorier and more over the top! Okay, so the original's approach at implied violence worked much better, but I appreciated the filmmaker's aiming for something different! I had a lot of fun watching Billy maim and dismember all of the sorority girls and their boyfriends! The kills were absolutely crazy! A lot of blood splashing! Unfortunately, the characters here, unlike in 1974, are purely 2-dimensional and unforgivably stupid. However, the performances were very well done, and there were some truly witty lines of dialogue! One thing this film reaped was dark humor! Much appreciated! I especially LOVED the performance done by Billy's mother! She was the best actress in the film and unfortunately had the least screen time. Also different from the original is the fact that Billy is identified and his origin is revealed. Again, this completely takes away the suspense and mystery of the killer like the original's had. BUT, the flashback scenes were very well done! It really got to you and was disturbing to say the least. It also did a very good job of portraying a morbid family. Well done on that part!Again, as I said before, there is NO suspense here! The violence and scares are pretty much laughable, but that's why this film is fun! It's so bad and flawed that it's a riot and a good time! My advice: Think of it as a completely different film. In no way does this hurt the original. The 1974 version still exists. The 2006 version will go nowhere, but it will always remain a fun little piece of cheese to watch whenever anyone wants to have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We needed one more "Alternate" in the Bonus Features</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know by now that when you watch a teen slasher movie you cannot set high expectations. If I go into it expecting the usual formula (a deranged killer separates the hapless youngsters and kills them one-by-one in horrible ways) then it should be fine. Somehow, though, Black Christmas managed to disappoint me anyway.I don't, for example, expect the acting to be stellar. Honestly, even if there are a few skilled actors hidden among the T&amp;A the typical slasher script is not going to lend itself to them flexing any dramatic muscles. But, please. Oliver Hudson played the Kyle character so laughably wooden that it was really annoying. And, what happened to Lacy Chabert? She was touted at one time as being "one of the most promising young actresses" but we find her in this dismal mess as not only one of the generic victims, but also one that gets offed halfway through the movie. No, even by slasher standards, the performances are uniformly horrible.Ah well, there's the gore right? That's the real reason to watch a slasher flick. Strike two for Black Christmas here. And I watched the "Unrated" version. I can only imagine how tame and unimaginative the theatrical "R" version must have been. The one big thing seemed to be the eyeball. Everyone had their eye plucked out, or poked out or even shoved through the back of their head. But, if you're going to make that your central gore theme, at least know the eye. They're actually pretty delicate organs, easily punctured and drained. In Black Christmas they were plucked out and waved about on ridiculously fake looking stalks or, as mentioned, shoved through heads, all the while remaining perfectly intact. The eyes held up so well that the killer used them as Christmas tree ornaments. There was a scene in Alias (Season 4 I think) where, because the writers understood the nature of the eye, Marshall's plucking of one caused far more discomfort without the viewer actually seeing any of the gore than all of Black Christmas' fake splatter combined.Okay, well, how about the story? Your slasher flick needs a killer with a background so twisted that, in retribution, you can only imagine the terror he or she is going to visit on the victims. Strike three, and Black Christmas is out. Billy Lenz is never going to have to worry about being mentioned in the same breath as Vorhees, Myers or Krueger. He was a kid whose mother, with her boyfriend, murdered his father. She knew Billy witnessed them burying the father but we didn't see her do anything violent to him. She made him stay in the attic and even went up to have sex with him. Eh? that's twisted but not in the way to spawn a slasher-flick villain. Oh wait, Billy was also born with a rare liver disease that made his skin yellow. This didn't really matter as most of his scenes were far too darkly lit to notice. Okay but he did have a daughter/sister from his union with mom. She also turned into a slasher-flick villainess. *yawn* It's all really just weak. Including the movie's catchphrase, hissed repeatedly by both killers, "(Insert victim's name here) is in our family noooowwww!" Okay. Whatever.After the credits finally rolled we hopped over to the bonus features as I always like to watch the theatrical trailer after I've seen a movie. I don't like to watch them beforehand, as trailers now tend to give away plot points. That wouldn't have been an issue here of course, but I enjoy seeing the trailers to see what key elements they decided would be the most useful in convincing folks to see the movie. I noticed in the bonus features that they included an "Alternate Ending". I didn't bother watching it but it made me wish they had included a link to an "Alternate Movie". A better one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modestly Flawed Remake of the Bob Clark Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago, a mistreated boy named Billy Lenz slaughtered his family in a one-house killing spree. Not surprisingly, this had him committed to an asylum. Since then, his house has been converted into a sorority house. And this Christmas, Billy wants to be home with his family to celebrate.Let me say a few nice things before I start venting. First, I have to say I must have been a very good boy this year because I can't recall such an attractive cast in the recent past. Three of my all-time favorite young ladies show up here: Michelle Trachtenberg ("Eurotrip"), Lacey Chabert ("Pleasure Drivers"), and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (numerous recent horror films, including "Final Destination 3"). It was quite the visual feast!I also enjoyed the inclusion of Andrea Martin as Ms. MacHenry, the house mother. Martin was one of the college girls from the original film and I think it's important to pay some sort of tribute like this (as well as the use of "Clark Sanitarium"). She was a good pick, better than Margot Kidder.And the use of incest and cannibalism is always a plus (both of which were absent in the original)... and the gore was decent (though not great) with the constant eye-gouging thanks to a glass unicorn. I do love unicorns, as my embroidered unicorn pillow might suggest. While I do not think it was intentional, I appreciate how the unicorn reminded me of another great classic, "The Abominable Dr. Phibes".But let's start the ripping: Glen Morgan was probably the wrong guy to direct this. He brought along cast members from his prior films (again, such as "Final Destination 3") which was fine, but seemed to put very little thought into any of this. And his films have more of a teenager quality to them, making even the gore, incest and cannibalism seem very youth-oriented, if that makes any sense. R-Rated or not, this was meant for teens to watch. He could have really stepped it up a dozen notches.The girls get little or no personalities. I don't think I learned half of their names and had difficulty keeping them straight. Maybe reduce the number by one or two so we could at least see them for ten minutes? On the flip side, the film focused almost entirely on Billy Lenz, providing his entire back story. The original never touched on this at all, which made him creepier and more mysterious. Here, there's nothing strange about him (besides the yellow skin and eyes, which play no importance). Obviously, Morgan never learned the secret of good horror: don't show the killer.Furthermore, they wasted the character of the boyfriend Kyle (who was named Peter in the original). Here, he is briefly thought by the girls to be the killer, but the audience knows the whole time that he's not. In the original, you never know whether or not Peter is the killer (in fact, many people who watched all the way to the end still aren't sure). If Kyle isn't a red herring, and his only purpose is to bring up some sex tape which was not important to the story (despite being shown again and again), then what the hell was he doing in the movie at all?Other great elements from the original were toned down: the police station scenes, the drunk girl (who now passes out right away). And a shower scene was added, but no explicit nudity, making it almost a complete waste of time.I'll stop before I start frothing at the mouth. Because, seriously, I was let down. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this movie, but it was clearly the teen remake (not unlike the newer "When A Stranger Calls"). If you need a fix of girls getting strangled with a plastic bag and stabbed in the eye (and that's really all you'll see), check this out. Otherwise, you'll find plenty of great slashers out there on the video shelf. And, of course, you simply cannot beat the original "Black Christmas", one of the best horror films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most mind numbingly retarded movie I've ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas is the remake of the 1974 horror classic about a group of sorority girls who are menaced by a killer on Christmas Eve. However, where the original had a simple plot that involved a killer in the attic making creepy phone calls to the girls before the killing starts. Well, I guess the makers of this version decided that wasn't hip enough. That wasn't "2006 generic slasher movie" enough, so they added a bogus back story and some twisted elements, and we got worthless, mindless dreck.Everything that made the original good was gone in this movie. The first movie had everything. Point of view shots for the killer so we never actually see him. In the original we know nothing about the killer or his motives. We have to piece together our own back story through his phone calls. There are suspects throughout the movie who we think the killer could be. There's a detective investigating the calls. All of the girls are likable. In this version we are treated to a handful of unlikeable characters. We know who the killer is right away, and a ridiculous back story is spoon fed to us. It involves Billy (the killer in the original) witnessing his mother kill his father. His mother remarries and keeps him locked in the attic until one night she decides to have sex with him. Billy fathers his little sister, and then when she's six he stabs her eye out and kills his mother and step father. Agnes ends up in the sorority house and ends up committing most of the murders, and Billy, who is SUPPOSED to be the main killer, plays second fiddle and does basically nothing. Even the "calls are coming from in the house" twist is gone.The writing is just god awful, and it shows what the writers think teenagers are like nowadays. It's wonderful seeing such brilliantly thought out dialogue as "Guys, it's, like, Christmas Eve". The acting isn't any better. The only remotely okay acting comes from Andrea Martin who is in here to pay respect to the original, but it's useless. This is the worst acting I've seen in a horror movie since the Saw trilogy.Stay far away from this mess. It's complete disrespect to a classic horror film.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Making a slasher film isn't an excuse to write/direct like an utter imbecile.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BC is precisely what the dumbed-down masses deserve. I have no idea what the original is like, but it can only be better than this incredibly uninvolving and dull garbage.A bunch of bickering females, realizing they're in danger, refuse to leave the house - even though it's a house in which mass-murder was committed - and instead decide to hang around so that they can be butchered one-by-one. (It's the old Eddie Murphy "if the house is haunted, get the f*** out!" line.) Everything that occurs in this typical slasher film, the worst of all horror genres, is cretinous and no amount of "spicing it up" with cannibalism and incest can change that.The supposedly major twist at the end is that the killer's sister/daughter is in the house, too; only a moron could not see that coming. Even worse, Agnes is played by a man, and rather large man. I have no idea what they were thinking. Agnes was shown to be an ugly girl at 12, but not MANLY. There is no explanation as to when or why this creature decided to have sex-change surgery, accompanied with massive, almost Mickeyrourkian (or Cheresque) facial surgery.Nothing makes sense, but even a silly little slasher film needs to have a semblance of logic. It isn't quite clear why Agnes decided to help Billy kill utter strangers, when she has every reason to avenge her lost eye by chopping off Billy's own head. So basically Agnes was grateful to her brother for having attacked her so viciously, is she?... However, if you think the makers of this crap-o-rama were satisfied with boring you only with cretinous house activities, think again. The movie decides to drag on by resurrecting the brother/sister-father/daughter couple in a hospital morgue, after which the two proceed to find the only remaining survivors with ease that even those who designed the building couldn't muster. Plus, I never quite understood why they'd so single-mindedly go for the blonde and the brunette, when they had a plethora of staff and other patients to kill.Did you know that an ice-cone falling from only a meter above you will pierce your flesh like soft butter? Apparently, the women all had very soft heads, which is something I can't disagree with...I also love the way Billy escaped the lunatic asylum. If all madhouse guards were this dumb then all such asylums would be empty all the time.Apparently, when a madhouse guard is killed, it takes about ten weeks for anyone to find the body and alert the police.If it was snowing that much and the roads were blocked, then how the hell did Agnes and Billy get to the house? Surely they never had the time to learn to drive. Or maybe they just took a bus. Or grew wings and flew. Or maybe both of them were locked up in hospitals that were conveniently close to the house. Mere meters away...Surely a candidate for one of the worst horror film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scooby Doo has more compelling believable story lines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of all sorts of horror films including stalker / slasher type movies and this is perhaps the worst modern example of one of these I have ever sat through. None of the characters are likable so you do not care if they are murdered, in fact there is so little character development that they are all interchangeable. Despite some reasonable gore there is so little tension that it drags on for what seems like hours.In the end it simply does not work because of so many unbelievable situations. They are stalked around a sorority house that is miles from anywhere (are you not supposed to share these to live NEAR a campus ?). Even when dead bodies start to pile up they still go off into the dark on their own to check out noises !!! Every situation is ridiculous, how the killer fools the guard at the asylum for example. No one would ever act in the way the guard does and this theme follows the whole film through. You do wonder how the inept script was ever green lighted. One to avoid, even for fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm not dreaming of a Black Christmas..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are very confident in their ability to do many things right, thus ensuring an intriguing experience. A movie like "Black Christmas," however, is mostly confident in its ability to do many things wrong, yet still remain watchable on some bizarre level. Needless to say, it's an overhaul of the seminal 1974 slasher of the same name, in which a lonely sorority house is besieged by a killer making obscene phone-calls from the attic over the holidays. The 2006 version takes this premise and attempts to build a backstory around murderer Billy Lentz, who remained a shadowy specter throughout Bob Clark's film. I have to give writer-director Glen Morgan credit: while this bit of character development is wildly uneven (including giving Billy a sister-in-madness), it is consistent with the wildly inconsistent rest of the film. Morgan brought a strong sense of macabre humor and visual style (I dare call it "Burtonesuqe") to his exceptional remake of "Willard" (helped by Crispin Glover's delightfully wacky performance), but his stylistic leanings are simply the wrong match for a "Black Christmas" remake. There is not a single suspenseful scene to be found, and the violence is so exaggerated that it defuses any horrific effect (seriously, a killer who eats eyeballs?); additionally, the characters are so ill-defined that it's hard to keep track of who's who (had the number of girls been whittled down the point where they had actual personalities, we might have actually given a damn about them). And, for a slasher film coming in the wake of "Scream" and its kindred, "Black Christmas" just shows a general lack of common sense when an obvious threat is lurking (can you really feel sorry for a security guard who lingers in a maniac's room long enough to get knocked off?). But in an odd way, "Black Christmas" avoids the oblivion of crappy horror remakes due to Morgan's impassioned, assured sense of visual style?that being said, it's nowhere near as good as its predecessor.4.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing remake - see the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was not a bad idea to attempt a remake of Black Christmas. The original, with all its scurrying around in a pre-historic telephone exchange, was ripe for updating. The new version, however, brings the technology up to date and keeps the creepy chocolate box setting, but loses just about everything else that was decent about the original. The storyline for the first film was slow, but successfully built up suspense as Billy picked off each of the girls one by one, while the police gradually tracked down his whereabouts. In the remake, the police are irrelevant - they can't help because there's too much snow - and so the whole thing after the first twenty minutes is focused on establishing a dreary line-up of red herrings while Billy, or whoever it is, quickly takes out each of the girls. One of the genuinely creepy things about the original was the way Billy's identity and motivation were never explained. Who was he? What was his connection to the house. Who is Agnes who he keeps groaning on about? The end of the film left the audience unsettled as Billy remained undetected and we still didn't know anything about him. For the new film the writers make the mistake of going all out to tell us everything and more about Billy and his uninteresting backstory. The flashbacks take us away from the tense situation in the house and are ultimately only confusing. Given their screwed up childhood, shouldn't we feel sorry for Billy and Agnes? Yes - but no, they want to eat your eyeballs.It's not only Billy and Agnes who are one dimensional. None of the girls is given anything more than the most obvious of personality traits. Most of them even look the same, so except for the blonde "final girl," I couldn't tell you anything about what distinguishes each of them from one another. Again, this is in stark contrast with the original film in which the main characters are interesting and memorable. Margot Kidder in particular was striking as the loudmouth proto-feminist who drinks too much and suffers a memorable asthma attack. And then Olivia Hussey brought real credibility as well as a strange kind of Virgin Mary sexuality to the central role. Remarkably her arguments with her boyfriend focused on her wanting to have an abortion while he wanted to get married and start a family. Unthinkable in modern Hollywood - so this has to be turned into arguments about her boyfriend cheating on her with one of the girls. Depressingly unimaginative.The endings of the two films are again worth comparing. The original ends with a striking but subtle twist. The ringing of the phone as the camera slowly zooms away from the attic window provided a genuinely "black" ending, signifying the death of everyone in the house even as we see a policeman guarding the front door. The new film has the predictable - "s/he's not really dead - look behind you" - moment. And then it all just ends, as if the film-makers knew that by this time no one in the audience would really care anyway.For a movie that sends you to bed over Christmas locking your doors and shivering at the creaky sounds coming from upstairs, settle down with some sherry and mince pies with the DVD of the original Black Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By slasher standards, this was pretty average and forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Black Christmas" a sorority house is terrorized by a killer who makes frightening telephone calls before murdering the sorority sisters during the Christmas break.Black Christmas is a bland slasher film with very few scares. The original was a mediocre horror film with a decent screenplay. It's a little overrated but at least it developed the story and characters instead of just rushing into the murders. That's what this remake does. It's pretty much a disturbing bloodbath from beginning to end with very few memorable scenes. The frantic pace does keep things interesting and it never gets dull. However, watching so many vacant characters die before you get a chance to remember their names does not equal quality. At best, this could be a minor guilty pleasure although I really have no desire to see it again.Glen Morgan did a great job with Final Destination and Willard. Here, he's just lazy and he follows a typical path for slasher movies. As mentioned above, he does an okay job with the pace and I have to give him credit for a few cool death scenes but that's it. The writing was awful and it really brought the overall quality down. The dialog was silly and just laughable. All of the dramatic scenes fell flat because of the unnatural dialog. The way the writers handled the background of the killers was pathetic and the last fifteen minutes were horrible. It wasn't suspenseful at all, just unintentionally funny. The killers looked like rejected stunt doubles for White Chicks.Usually, I can ignore awful acting in slasher movies since it's not suppose to be the main attraction. In Black Christmas, the acting was too bad to ignore. Kate Cassidy was just awful as Kelli. She seemed to be reading her lines and it was obvious that she was just acting. Kristen Cloke gave the worst performance out of everyone. All of those botox injections are really taking a toll on her and she struggled to show emotion. Clearly, she got the job because she is married to the director or is that just a coincidence? Michelle Trachtenberg was just bland as was Crystal Lowe and Oliver Hudson. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was fine in Bobby but she was just horrible here. She was completely unconvincing and just laughable. Lacey Chabert was disappointing average and she didn't get a lot of screen time. Andrea Martin gave the best performance although that's not much of an accomplishment. Overall, Black Christmas may prove to be a decent rental just don't have high expectations and expect something trashy. Rating 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Not worth the 7 dollars I paid to watch.I walked into the theater, and wow! December 26, and nobody there except for me. I sat down and started watching the previews. That's when the people started arriving.Can you believe that a mother went into the theaters with her (seemed to be) 3 year-old? I thought to myself, "If this kid starts crying in the middle of the movie I have been waiting so long to see, I am going to go crazy." But by the first 25 minutes of the movie, I was the one who was about to cry.I love most actresses who performed in this movie. But they seemed one of those unknown actresses who are hyper to be acting in a movie exhibited all over the country. They were just plain dumb.The killers, wow! Glen Morgan tried to create such a fascinating, and disturbing back-story for Agnes and Billy, that made me want to leave the theater at the scene when his mom has sex with him, and nine months later, has a child. Yet, I felt like I had to sit there, and watch the movie sink even more in this clearly-fake-snow crap.The deaths were incredibly stupid, and the blood looked so fake (as well as the snow, if I haven't mentioned!). He tried to make this remake of a classic into another silly-just-want-money flicks such as Final Destination, which most people love. Yet, there is a slight difference of these two movies. Final Destination is made for people to have a wild laugh at how surprisingly (should I say?) smart situations the writer puts the characters in to DIE. This movie is about two demented killers, psychopaths. Go watch this movie if you want to see most deaths off-screen (Ha?), and girls getting killed by icicles, umbrellas, ice skates, Christmas trees, blah blah...And what was up with Billy's sudden obsession with the eyes? Jesus! I love scary movies, but this one looked like a comedy without any funny moments, except for the quote "Excuse me, But I love your coat!" at a moment where... ah, I'll let you watch the movie.The movie is rated R strong horror violence and gore, sexuality, nudity and language. This should be a PG-13 child flick! Go watch the Bob Clark directed classic from 1975. You'll be much better off with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another awful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, call me old school, but to say that this movie was as good or better than the original is confounding and appalling. Scanning some of the comments, I find it interesting that some folks downgrade the original 1974 version because it leaves loose ends, and the new one explains things. I will say that the remake does provide a back story on the killer lacking in the original, but that doesn't make it any better. Quite the contrary. Another slash and gore bore.The subtle atmospheric dread and suspense BC 1974 in the old version, while not great, is vastly superior. It is hard to improve on one of the best of the genre, and the original Black Christmas certainly belongs near the top. It did influence Halloween, When A Stranger Calls, Friday the 13th I and other classics of a few years later and is as good or better than all of them.The 2006 version belongs near the back of the rental area at your local DVD store. Watch it on cable some night, but for those who have seen neither, ignore the new version and find a copy of the old one to buy or rent. You'll be better served for your DVD dollar.A final editorial comment: I have yet to see a 200X horror film remake that came close to the original in spite of all the FX technology.....e.g. The Haunting. No, the Thirteen Ghosts remake was better, but only because the old Castle version was so cheap and campy. One man's opinion is that the Black Christmas remake would have been better not made. Final Destination I (at least) was quite unusual and quality in this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Slay Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was brilliant! Glen Morgan, know for the Final Destination movie's has really made a remake that is at least just as good as the original movie. It seems like he really understood the original movie and mixed that with his take on the story perfectly. And remaking the cult classic of Bob Clark is not easy. The film is exiting, funny and very enjoyable. But the character's could have been much better written. They are pretty typical such as, The heroine, the best friend, the bitch and so on and so on. But that didn't make the movie any worse. But not only the sorority girls are the real characters, The killer is really well developed and in some scenes you can even really recognize his feelings. The acting was brilliant with stars as Katie Cassidy who was in my opinion not really the right actress to play the heroine. But Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Michelle Trachtenberg and Crystal Lowe were really good in the movie, for me it felt like i got to know their characters the best. And i think that this movie could be the real big breakthrough for some of these actresses. Ant of course there is the drunk housemother played by Andrea Martin who also played in the original movie. But at some points, the movie felt too much like a Final Destination movie. But some scenes are really terrifying, like scenes in the attic, Which are at some point very gory. And the movie definitely didn't lack on gore, but sometimes, the gore took away the suspense which is too bad. But for the horror fans, i really recommend this movie. It has everything that you could want, Suspense, gore, a pretty good new take on the story and good humor. It is a nice and very entertaining movie to see on Christmas. The movie is exactly like what they promised it to be, the ultimate slay ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Predictable Collection of Clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 70's, the boy Billy is born with yellow skin due to a lever disease and his dysfunctional mother rejects him. Later he witnesses his mother and her lover killing his beloved father and burying him in the basement of their house, and he is locked in the attic alone along his childhood. When he is a teenager, he is sexually abused by his mother and she has a baby girl called Agnes. During Christmas, the deranged Billy escapes from his imprisonment, kills his mother and stepfather and blinds one eye of Agnes. He is declared insane and his sister is sent to an orphanage. In the present days, Billy escapes from the Clark Sanatorium to spend Christmas with his family. Meanwhile, his former house is the Delta Alpha Kappa sorority house in the campus of the Clement University, and the housemother (Andrea Martin) and the sisters Kelli Presley (Katie Cassidy), Dana (Lacey Chabert), Lauren Hannon (Crystal Lowe), Megan (Jessica Harmon), Heather (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Megan Helms (Jessica Harmon), Melissa (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Eve Agnew (Kathleen Kole) are preparing the house for Christmas party in a stormy night while Clair Crosby (Leela Savasta) is in her room writing a card to bury the hatchet with her sister. When three sisters vanish, the others receive weird phone calls and believe something is wrong, but they find that they are trapped in the location."Black Christmas" is another forgettable slasher with a collection of clichés. The attitudes and lines of the characters are always stupid and senseless, splitting the group of survivors to be slaughtered in the next scene. The viewer has the sensation of déj? vu, not because it is a remake of a 1974 movie, but due to the lack of originality and predictability of the story. However, the cinematography and the set decoration give a great atmosphere with the contrast of the colorful Christmas decoration and lightning and the deaths and the sinister attic where Billy lived. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): Not Available</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This only gets 1 star because IMDb doesn't have a 0 star category. Horrible doesn't begin to describe this crap. I don't want to hate on anyone in Hollywood, that's too easy an escape but I want to point out some of the typical flaws with these type of movies and ask the screen writer, "Why fall for the same problems as typical horror movies do?" Case in point; after getting obscene phone calls and the house loses power while every other house on the block remains lit, and a character suddenly vanishes, why would you go under the house by yourself to turn the power back on?" Another silly scenario; "What kind of reject from the CSI academy doesn't realize that both murderers are STILL alive after zipping them up in body bags?" Just these two big problems alone are just examples of stupidity run a muck. I'm sorry but after loving the first Final Destination and enjoying the third one, I can't fathom how this thing could have been seen as anything but a cheap rip off of a much better original.Sad to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All blood, gore &amp; violence but no story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A completely rubbish stupid film with no story and all gore and violence. Me and my friends went into the cinemas to see this film because it is the same creators of the Final Destination series but unfortunately it was a big, big disappointment. One of the worst films I've ever seen the movie was so sick, disgusting and depressing it had popping eye balls out, killing your own family members, taking bits out of them and eating it. Worst of all in one of the scenes of the killer's flashback his mother was pregnant and had a girl but the girl's father was also her brother so basically he had sex with his mum how disgusting can you get? There is already far too much sex in the media but that is totally out of order. Overall such films should not be made and anyone who has given this movie a 2/10 or more must be joking. If I see this film on DVD for free on the shelf right in front of me I would not take it I swear! It is supposed to be a remake of a 70s Black Christmas I've not seen it and I'm glad I didn't and nowadays filmmakers are running out of ideas so they are just continually making remakes e.g. King Kong, The Hills Have Eyes &amp; When a Stranger Calls. You can never run out of ideas they all just need to work harder. But watching this film is like you are a kid on Christmas Eve given the bad news that Santa Clause is dead. People are already losing their Christmas spirit and this movie was even more discouraging, it certainly turned everyone Christmas into black.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't Top The Original, But A Fun Slasher Movie Nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, I am a huge fan of the original "Black Christmas", and hold it as one of the best slasher films of all time, so I was excited to see this remake - it was a bit of a letdown, but I still liked it. "Black Christmas" introduces us to serial killer Billy Lenz, who murdered his scummy, abusive mother and his stepfather, and severely injured his little sister on Christmas Eve 1991. Now years later, his childhood home has turned into a sorority, and a group of girls are celebrating the holidays in the middle of a huge snowstorm. With an unknown killer already murdering girls within the house, Billy escapes from the mental asylum and goes back home for the holidays. From there, the onslaught continues, and the sorority begins receiving bizarre phone calls, and the girls begin to die one by one.Okay, okay - it's obvious that this remake is never going to top the 1974 original, which many consider to be the best slasher film of all time. But, I still think this is a fun little holiday horror flick. The storyline is completely reworked from the original - the only thing they really have in common is the fact that it takes place during Christmas in a sorority house, and that someone is murdering the girls inside. Other than that, it's much different in almost every respect, although there are some nods to the original that can be found here and there. I have to admit the script is a little messy, and it jumps around far too much. This remake gives us a lengthy history on our villain (told through flashbacks throughout the film), and jumps back and forth between this and the current-day story involving the sorority girls, diminishing any potential suspense or tension. A major plot twist is also given away within the first ten minutes of the film as well, which could have been avoided with a little writing improvement.So, you're probably thinking - "So is this movie all bad, or not?". Well, while the script may not be great, the film is so entertaining you could likely dismiss it's faults. The pacing is rapid and things happen really quickly, there's never a dull moment (something that the original film was very different from, being much more slow-going and moody). The Christmas theme is taken advantage of here, and the set decoration within the sorority house is wonderful (lights, wreaths, decorations everywhere) - this movie reeks holiday scenery, which is nice. Like most recent slasher films, there's a distinct amount of gore here as well, which, while it may have been over compensating for the lack of suspense, is still really nasty and uniquely executed. The murders are bloody and gross, but don't really add or take away anything from the film. I was surprised at the amount of cleverness in this film as well - the writing isn't perfect, but there are plenty of memorable sequences and some clever bits scattered throughout, I loved the attic finale in particular. As far as the acting goes, it really is pretty good. Katie Cassidy leads the cast as our heroine, with Michelle Trachtenberg, Lacey Chabert, Crystal Lowe, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as her fellow sorority sisters. Andrea Martin (who played a sorority girl herself in the original movie) plays the house mother of the film, which was nice to see. The performances were really good (especially for this type of movie), I liked all of the actresses &amp; their characters, and they perform believably. Any problems with the characters were really the fault of the script. The characters aren't developed enough - something that should have been taken care of rather than elaborating greatly on the villain's life history - and that's a bit of a problem. But there are some very funny lines thrown in here (lots of dark humor can be found in this movie as well) and some clever humorous moments (which, while they entice the viewer to take the movie less seriously, provide for a funner experience).Overall, I really enjoyed this remake of "Black Christmas". The original film is a classic masterpiece of suspense, and this remake doesn't come close to topping it. But it's still an energetic, fun-spirited little Christmastime slasher movie. It has it's fair share of problems (and had the potential to be a much better movie in terms of suspense and genuine scariness), but it will always remain a fun little horror movie to watch when the season rolls around. It's an entertaining movie (and contains some touches that make it stand out from most), so enjoy it for what it is - just don't expect it to be anywhere near as serious (or scary) as the original, because in that respect, the two films are very different. I may be overrating it for what it is, but I have to give it some good points for being so imaginative and entertaining. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorority girls are terrorized on Christmas Eve by the psychotic murderer that once lived in their house.Black Christmas 2006 isn't anything like the classic 1974 original. This remake ignores practically everything about the original film and instead just becomes a routine, bloody slasher flick. There's little surprise in this slasher outing, you've got all the clichés on display ? a group of girls with attitudes, some background on a killer with a bad home life, lots of false scares, and plenty of gory over-the-top killings. It's all pretty tasteless and uninspiring. The lame dialog, stereotyped characters, and sub-par cast definitely don't help matters either. Not even the presence of Andrea Martin, of the original film, lends much credibility to this turgid remake.For those seeking a brainless slasher-fest I suppose this remake would be adequate enough, though it's definitely not to be taken seriously by any means. As a remake though, it's pretty much a foul insult to the classic original.* 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just loved the movie so much! It had everything a horror movie should have; Gore, fun kills, suspense and laugh-out-loud moments.I am a fan of Glen Morgan's horror franchise Final Destination so I had high hopes for Black Christmas, I was not disappointed at all, the direction was spot on but what impressed me the most was how fantastic the acting was, none of the lead's in this movie are highly experienced actress' but they all pulled off great performances (especially Lacey Chabert and Crystal Lowe) and showed some fantastic acting chops. Unlike the original in this version you find out more about the killer which I enjoyed and thought very realistic you might even find yourself feeling for the killer during the flashback scenes, His life is pretty poor and his mother is venomous.The phone calls are not as scary or menacing as the ones in the original movie, which is a shame but the acting is better so there are + and - all the way through, Gore hounds will enjoy this movie very much, there are many eyeball gouging and blood splats to keep the hounds happy, The only thing that I will say is bad about the movie is that you don't get to know the Sorority girls well enough, there is only the most brief of dialogue to show their characters and that is a shame because I think they all had a likability and with a little more screen time or even a mentioned back story you would have found yourself rooting for all of them.As horror goes Black Christmas is a pretty formulaic movie, the acting and the gruesome kills add a little something to boost the movie but people going in expecting a masterpiece are going to be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's been a lot of negativity about this film, I never saw the original but i did think this film looked interesting after watching the trailer.Basically, this film is pure fun, it won't win any awards but it is enjoyable. It isn't scary but the over the top kills and gore make this film enjoyable to watch with friends.The acting is pretty good and the film tries it's best to establish each character before the main bloodshed begins. I'd say my favourite characters were Melissa and Lauren, I like Melissa because of her loyalty and i liked Lauren because she had cracking lines.One of the bad things about this film is the slightly repetitive kills, OKAY! we get you like eyeballs!!!!! but i won't go to much detail here. One of the things the film did well was making you grow somewhat attached to the characters (apart from Kelli, she was just bland).Overall I'd say, go to this film if you like slasher films but don't go expecting a masterpiece. But for what it is, i thought it was a blast to watch, especially with a group of friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the 1974 horror movie Black Christmas. The movie tells the story about Billy, a young boy who was abused by his mother as a child. While his mother was cheating on Billy's father, she eventually killed his father and kept Billy in the attic - for good, while she was with her lover and starting a "new" family. As Billy's mother fell pregnant with a daughter and treated her with love, which Billy had never experienced with his mother, Billy came out of the attic after years and brutally murdered his mother and her lover. Cut to present day, a group of eight sorority sisters consisting of Kelli (Katie Cassidy), Dana (Lacey Chabert), Lauren (Crystal Lowe), Megan (Jessica Harmon), Claire (Leela Savasta), Heather (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Megan (Jessica Harmon) and Melissa (Michelle Trachtenberg) and their house mother (Andrea Martin),who now live in Billy's childhood home, find themselves being harassed by threatening and intimidating mystery phone-calls during Christmas Break and as one of the girls goes missing, the girls begin being murdered one by one by no other than Billy.Nothing special, but the more thrills and chills, then you would expect in a slasher film. It was okay, but it wasn't the best. It has some cheesy effects and only a couple of flaws. It's worth for renting for anyone who likes slashers.Unrated for Extreme Graphic Violence, Nudity, Sexual Situations and Strong Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleaseingly Fun Slasher Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas is undeserving of its reputationPlot: On Christmas Eve in 1991 Billy Lenz (Robert Mann) murdered his mother (Karin Konoval) and stepfather (Howard Siegel) after he escapes out of the attic where they kept him locked up after he witnessed the death of his father (Peter Wilds) at the hands of his mother and stepfather. He also gouges the eye out of his sister Agnes (Dean Friss). Flash forward to Christmas of 2006 and Billy's house has become a sorority house where Kelli (Katie Cassidy), Melissa (Michelle Trachenburg), Heather (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Lauren (Crystal Lowe), Dana (Lacey Chabert), Megan (Jessica Harmon), Clair (Leela Savasta), Eve (Kathleen Kole), and their house mother Miss Mac (Andrea Martin) live. Billy escapes from the mental hospital where he has been kept and heads home with an unknown assailant already at the house slaying the sisters. Clair's sister Leigh (Kristen Cloke) shows up at the house for Clair, but she is nowhere to be found. Kelli's boyfriend Kyle (Oliver Hudson) also shows up and as the night continues they have to fight to stay alive.The Good News: I really liked this film and though it delivered to my expectations. This film has no problem showing off that this was inspired by the classic slasher films in the eighty's. The stereotypes are all here, but the wonderful actresses and actors portraying the characters turn those stereotypes into 3-D characters. The character interactions are a major highlight and they all have distinct personalities and we care what happens to them. Very impressive for a slasher film. Equally impressive is the fantastic splatter and great kills. This is the first really gory film I've seen in a long time. The gore flows natural and looks realistic. The kills are all so great with many of them having a slow and unnerving build up. My favorite kill has to be the death of Melissa. I won't spoil it, but I must say she put up a fight and she has the most creative death. The phone calls are disturbingly creepy and eerie. The back story was as good as you can get and mixed up my emotions by feeling sorry for Billy. I want to give the cast and crew two thumbs up for the final thirty minutes. The whole ending from between the walls to the stalking in the hospital are excellent suspense thrills and chills and move from one scene to the next with a frantic pace. The whole movie moves along faster than the last scene and the cast provides for a great body count. Unusually the scenery is nice and the snow looks real and all the Christmas lights and decorations around the house including the frequent Christmas songs make the Christmas atmosphere. The Bad News: I have the tinniest flaw probably in history and that is that the credits look cheap and fake. Lauging yet?Conclusion: Any hardcore slasher fan will want to give this a look and if you're a fan of the original and are open to change than this is a safe bet, but if you hold the original in the highest regards you may want to skip this one.

		<shortDescription>Twisted, Interesting &amp; Bloody!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying when I went to see this film yesterday I actually really did think that it would suck, Prob. because of all the bashers out there who are like "worst movie ever" and my favorite "boring as all hell, and not even remotely a good slasher flick!" well I'm here to tell you that they are all WRONG! First of all, you don't go into this film thinking it will be the best horror film ever with great acting! and you can't do nothing but compare it to the original because then you will most surely hate it! you just don't do it why?!? because it's a remake with a lot of different elements and it's a slasher film! you go into it expecting blood, gore &amp; guts and that's what I got and I was impressed.And with a bonus it actually gave us a decent storyline that made the film more interesting as it went on, the twisted tale of Billy, Agnes &amp; there mother was great as it added more interest into the film that just the blood &amp; gore would have done... I'll admit I was confused as to why there were 2 killers but then as it went on I understood what was going on and again I was impressed with the way they pulled everything off! A twisted tale of what was thought to be Brother &amp; Sister turned out to be the twisted tale of Father &amp; Daughter! The kill's were nice as well easily at least 15 if not more kill's which is always a bonus in any slasher film. There was one kill in particular that I really enjoyed the most, when Billy killed his mother by beating her numerous times with the dough roller and using a cookie cutter to make human flesh cookies that part I ate right up as I thought it was something new and innovative! In closing, my only problems with his film is that I think they should have left Billy alive! because Agnes your not really sure about whether or not she dies or lives a sequel with Billy &amp; Agnes would have great! my last problem was that some of the thing's shown in the trailer were not actually shown in the film itself two thing's that I noticed in the trailer were not in the film (the part were Billy is on the roof of the ceiling and he turn's around freakishly waiting for the girl wasn't in, and the part were a girl is getting dragged to these spinning blades wasn't in as well) so I was kinda disappointed in that but hey! there's always the DVD! hopefully it will get a unrated cut which I would surely purchase.Overall if your a horror/slasher fan then I would def. recommend going to see Black Christmas! my overall rating is a 8/10.</fullReview>

I loved the ending of the movie, the killers die. I am glad that there won't be a second movie coming out soon. Remakes are not that great anymore because people can't end a movie right. I thought that the girls were super hot and needed to get naked but I was tricked. I like that they followed the same path as the original and built more to it.

		<shortDescription>A classic in its own right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of Black Christmas was fantastic! Where do I begin? well...It had everything the original had and more, apart from the classic Billy!! phone scene. Which they would have never used anyway, because its part of what made the original great (they probably won't have got away with putting it in anyway). Yes I know you can't have Black Christmas without the phone scene (I thought that at first), but it does work for this film. Anyway that's the only criticism out of the way. Firstly the cast, I hadn't really seen any of the cast before. On the DVD cover, it said that one of the actresses was in 'When a Stranger Calls' and another was in 'Grindhouse'. Not that i'd recognised them, and probably wouldn't if I saw them again. But the point is, all the cast were great. I liked how all the characters were very different and how you couldn't really tell who was supposed to be the main character (AT ALL!) That really kept you guessing till the end, because you couldn't really figure out who was going to get it next. Where as in most of these films, you figure out who the main character is within two seconds of starting the film (I suppose thats why you pick nobody's.The story was interesting and different, not just regurgitated the original story with special effects, which you see a lot today. The idea of a ringer was circled around a lot in the film, but with so many suspects, it worked. Then to find out it was him and his sister Agnes, was a great twist. The flashbacks were a clever addition to the film as well, Showing how he grew up and what made him like that. Plus also managing to get the 'BILLY' phrase into the film, by showing where it originated from (his mother saying it to him). I also find that with the flashbacks the film was explained much more, which you never really got with the first one (a sort of prequel and remake in one.)The film had much more gore than the first film, with some very gruesome special effects. But this just adds to what you get this film for. The ending was clearly well thought out, for it having so many alternative endings. I think they choose the right one in the end (though they were all good and interesting to watch), because this film tend to focus more on the Agnus side of things and fitted better to the film.All in all this may not be Oscar winning material, but it certainly is a masterpiece of horror (one of my favourite horror films anyway)and a credit to the original film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas- Scary, gory and Brill Acting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanna start by saying that this remake of Black Christmas is Excellent!First- The story was brill, the gore had it's great moments and it was a scary movie with enough deaths to keep all those death lovers out there amused.Second- I thought that some of the acting in this film was absolutely outstanding, but there was a few who were not as good. Basically I thought that Katie Cassidy who played the main role as Kelli done a World Class job as her acting skills are simply Gorgeous, she has got so much acting talent at such a young age and she showed it in this movie with a blindingly good performance. 1 of the best young actresses in the world. Oliver Hudson who played Kyle i also thought done a superb job considering the amount of time that he got on screen wasn't a lot. Robert Mann who played the physco Billy done an amazing role as the main killer. Elizabeth Winstead and Lacey Chabert threw in some great performances too. Although this film was great i thought Michelle Trachtenberg was very poor considering her so called experience that she had supposedly got on Buffy. Crystal Lowe and Kristen Cloke also gave poor performances but lucky enough the great performers made up for these 3 errors. Ron Selmour as the dumb security Guard done his average appearance in The 2-3 mins he had.Finally- The ratings out of 10Katie Casiidy 10/10 Oliver Hudson 9.5/10 Robert Mann 9/10 Lacey Chabert 8/10 Elizebeth Winstead 7/10 Michelle T 2/10 Crystal Lowe 3/10 Kristen Cloke 5/10 Ron Selmour 6/10All and All i highly recommend u buy this movie because it is a great horror movie in the making- i give this film a 9.5 out of 10 stars but since i cant give half stars ill give it the 10- Great Movie, A MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good gory fun.... The original's better though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title suggests, I am a fan of the original. But unlike others I'm not going to bombard you with reasons why the original is better. I'll just tell you the things that I liked about it, then move on to the criticisms afterwards.Also the spoilers here aren't really that big but I though I'd put up a warning just in case....First off, I was unfortunate enough to see the UK edited version, but that doesn't really count against the film. Second I had great faith in writer/director Glen Morgan and producer James Wong. They did great things with the first and third "Final Destination" movies and the remake of "Willard". Also they did a lot of the best "X Files" episodes.This movie looks really good. It contains a lot of great uneasy camera angles and an excellent brooding atmosphere. Basically it looks like any good horror film should. It's has a lot of great black humour as is Glen Morgan and James Wong's style and the suspense scenes work for giving you a nice scare! The flashbacks are pretty scary ass and yet manage to be pretty funny as well, and at the end of the film we're treated to a nice twist that I think fans of the original may appreciate, after getting over the initial confusion! Now for the bad points. First of all it was too short, but again I can't penalise the movie for that since I saw the UK short version. Second the gore in the movie was way over the top for a straight horror film. Some of the eyeball stuff was just too much (Did we really need to see that...? Damn!). I hear in the US version one eyeball death scene is replaced with a death involving an ice skate. I think this sounds better, but alas it was not to be in the UK version.Another problem was a fluke death involving an icicle, which will probably have you rubbing your eyes and thinking "What!". And lastly we have the hospital sequence at the end, which, though somewhat scary ass is a bit strange for me. But I'm probably just looking for things to criticise now.Overall it was an enjoyable, funny and scary horror movie, which delivers a nice twist amid some horribly OTT death scenes.It's not great and it's not horrible, but it's good. I suggest you watch the original first though as it still reigns superior.Now I have to try and get a hold of the longer US version! Thanks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has its moments but to start off with you don't get any decent suspense which is fine by me because I don't always need suspense to get a movie rolling for me. In my opinion it had a lot of likable characters and though it may only be me I did care for most of the lovely ladies that die.On slasher flicks, i would have to say that there is a standard amount of gore in this and it gives a back story which is something that the original didn't do but it is entirely up to you on whether this is a good thing or not.To be positive the movie hosts some lovely death scenes such as eyes being ripped out and eaten and being stabbed in the eye. I believe that near the end the movie seems to reach it's peak and though not give the greatest climax it certainly delivers an interesting ending depending on which version you watch version u.k or u.s.A back story is an interesting move and personally i liked it as did my friends but the original didn't introduce a back story which therefore made the movie much more intense and creepy but i preferred the idea of a back story but once again this is my opinion.If you're into a little hack and slash then this movie would be perfect for you, if you're looking for dark, creepy and less gory then look into the original.This film is one of the ultimate slay rides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas (2007)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's going to be a black Christmas at the Alpha Kappa Gamma sorority house, where a group of young women have been snowed in for the holidays ... for a crazed killer is having his Christmas dinner a few miles distant in the local mental institution ...~ Years before, Billy Lenz was born with a liver disorder rendering his skin yellow. Loved by his father, hated by his mother, Billy is locked in the attic for most of his childhood. After being told by his mother that the Russians have shot down and killed Santa Claus, Billy witnesses her kill his father following a drunken argument. Billy is later seduced by his mother in the attic and a new baby comes along, a girl named Agnes ...Billy becomes jealous of Agnes over time and one day pulls out one of her eyes, stabs his stepfather, and beats his mother to death with a rolling pin. His is quite rightly condemned insane and sentenced to the mental institution, after being found by the police eating human-mince pies. Agnes is sent to an orphanage ...Hopefully you're still with me at this point ...Back in 2006 the girls are still trapped in the sorority house and Billy is on the loose once more ... one-by-one they are picked off, their eyes missing like carrion left in the desert ... outside the blizzard rages and it's hours before help can arrive ~ I enjoyed this Yuletide Slasher Film, perhaps because it was set over Christmas. Like Halloween, there's something cool and mysterious about this holiday, even after one grows-up. It was certainly one of the better horror re-makes I've seen of late - the original was filmed in 1974 - though it may not pander to all tastes, especially those of a Christian orthodox. Although the plot isn't exactly original, the film is watchable throughout and there is a neat little twist at the end. The killing is extreme and graphic at times, and there are plenty of scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat, even make you jump! The production design and picture quality are very good - this film doesn't have a low budget feel to it - and the acting is good all round. In a nutshell you need to take the content - in-breeding, serial killing, psychologically disturbed behaviour - with a pinch of salt, like you would if you were watching an episode from Tales from the Crypt. Take this film too seriously and you too could be spending Christmas in the nut house ...Wrap up warm and grab a sherry and mince pie, 'cause you're gonna have a very bloody Christmas with this slasher flick! Contains scenes of violence and gore, sex and nudity, and strong language.Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good and fun remake, though mediocre at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.Black X-Mas is overall a nice and entertaining movie that people are too harsh on. It's fun and exciting and I had a good time watching it, which is really all it was meant for. I shouldn't forget to mention very gory to all you "gore-lovers" out there, and a lot of deaths were cool.Compared to the original, it ultimately fails in being as well written and played out, but succeeds in being more fun and relevant, and I think both are equal in overall comparison for their enjoyment. It is just one of those movies where if you only watched it once, you couldn't really take in it's full potential and reason, but on a rewatch it really comes off as a no-brained, enjoyable, popcorn flick which is what it intended to be, I think, and is a good movie solely for it's entertainment, no matter what critics said about it, what reviews it got, and that it was a box office bomb.All the people in it played their parts rather well, though there were certainly no Oscar-worthy performances at all, and some were very popular actresses that got very indulging and interesting roles, such as Lacey Chabert with Dana, who I loved as a character overall. Though it gets bland and mediocre at times with the entire story line, I've already said many times before that it's just good fun.I don't fully understand what was really that horrible about it. Yes, there were tons of flaws, but every modern horror flick is bound to have them. The characters were likable, deaths were grisly, plot and performances were so so, but this is an over halfway satisfying movie that requires a tinsy bit more gratitude than it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Take It For What It Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So there's so many mixed feelings about this movie and I really feel that you're either going to hate it or like it but find a few flaws that you didn't like. Everyone I have talked to has wanted to change something about the film that could have done better. Just that simple. I think there are two categories with this film. A die hard original Black Christmas Fan who hates how this movie turned out or a die hard original Black Christmas Fan who appreciates the remake for what it truly is. It truly is a great film. The remake follows somewhat of the same story the original did. It added a few things here and there, but just like any remake would do. Billy Lenz, a neglected child by his abusive mother is finally sent over the edge one day. He has been locked in the attic for a number of years and has witnessed great events that have changed his life. You could call him crazy if you wanted. Lets just say he doesn't play nice with his sister and mother. He is sent to a mental institution where he tries to get out every Christmas to get back home. 15 years later he finally escapes and he's not coming home to an empty house. He's got a group of college friends waiting there for him. They are snowed in for the holidays and they don't know what horror is in store for them as the night unfolds! I thought the film was fantastic. It has a great opening to the movie and really has that 80's horror vibe going on which I love about the movie. The acting was great. The girls in my opinion were all main characters because they all played a huge role in the film. In my personal opinion I thought Crystal Lowe stood out the most with this being her first lead character she's ever played. She did amazing things with this character and I really don't think nobody else could have done. The other actress in the film was Lacey Chabert who like Crystal Lowe just stood out from the crowd. To me, those two actresses really lit up the screen and made the movie. Even though I liked this movie very much, it did have it's flaws. I know that Glen Morgan pictured something entirely different than this for his film, but of course to Dimension they screwed that up making some parts of the film seem choppy and very short. The film itself is only 84 minutes including credits which I think could have been expanded to at least 95 minutes or so. One part of the movie that could have been expanded greatly was one of the beginning scenes in the living room with all the girls. I definitely felt that there could have been more time to get to know the characters a bit more. One other thing I did not like about this film was the ending. I didn't get it at all and I felt it could have been stronger. It felt very comic and I know that was not the intention which isn't a good sign. Other than that, I thought the film was superb. Overall, I loved the film. I thought it was a great ride and it was a solid remake. Yes, it had some flaws, but why penalize it for that. Every movie has it's flaws and that's just how it is. Coming from me, I think that a remake will never live up to the original. No remake made up until today has and that's the truth. So, appreciate this film for what it is and watch it. Don't compare it to the original because the two films are so different and are equally as good, but in different ways.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarily fake, and an insult to the cult classic 1974 version...(spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK...First off the acting made me want to vomit more than the "disturbing" murder scenes. All of the actresses are no-names for the most part, and it just goes to show where they all belong, in movies like these. It was absolutely terrible, the way they outlined the script/storyline was just pitiful. They try to make it so shocking to find out how sick in the head Billy is, but that just ruined it with the bad acting and the total fake-ness of all the eye gouging and all of that non-sense. The whole bag over the head was just lame because it lasted less than a second before a stake goes through the head. Everything in the movie was completely fake and I'm actually really upset that Dimension allowed to remake this movie into complete utter garbage. I watched this with a friend who is quite scared of horror films and he even laughed the whole time. All of the scenes that contained death in them looked like a poorly made Japanese 90's film death or something...worse. (In this case, worse..) I love horror movies, and I tolerate a lot of them and even back them up in some cases, but this was just pure trash and I can't believe anyone who was apart of this nonsense could find any pride in it whatsoever. There are some movies where you must ask, what were they thinking? The soundtrack was horrendous, Billy's yellow skin was just silliness all around and the daughter looked unbelievably fake and just stupid. That one scene where she goes "Forever!", like come on! What the hell!? How can you do this to Black Christmas! It was just...the epitome of cheesy and downright bad. Please don't ever see this movie, and if you do because you want to see the re-make of one of your favorite horror movies like I did, be prepared to laugh and be humiliated at the fact that you wasted 4 bucks on this rental. I'm sure BlockBuster will be laughing their asses off at whoever has to return this. It is a sin that it still lays upon my kitchen counter, such trash should be in the garbage where it belongs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My Fave New Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge horror freak! Black Xmas is one of my fave movies! i think Michelle Trachenburg,Robert Mann,Crystal Lowe and Mary Elizabeth Winstead did their absolute best in the film! But mostly Michelle. She was the role of a pretty young adult who was sassy and loyal to her sorority sisters! But anyway,some of the content seemed unrealistic and pointless. i mean eating people, that's just plain sick! it was pointless for that wackjob Billy Lenz to bake cookies out of his mom's skin and eat them. Billy should have just ran away from his family if the mom didn't care for him. the nice dad,before he got killed he should have divorced the wife and took Billy with him. don't you think that would really happen in real life anyway. the producer should have found a different reason why Billy was a serial killer! Shouldn't all the sorority sisters left the house walking instead of using a car after they found out that Claire was missing and after they got the phone call from Billy? and suriously,i'd rather be freezing cold than wait in the house till i'm dead. Why is Agnes played by a man anyway? that's just creepy. and making love with your son? yes, Billy's mom had sex with him while he was sleeping! How could Ms.Mac be killed by an icicle falling in her eye? wouldn't she just go blind? And Billy's Death was unrealistic! How could you die from falling down the stairs and being literally impailed on the top of a Christmas tree? In real life Billy would had just fallen off and broke his head on the tile or something! Otherwise the movie was awesome even though it was pointless I saw it with my best friend and we were all "What the Crap?" but still, we loved it! But just too much blood,gore and guts!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worked surprisingly well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen it... It was released here in Ireland last Friday Dec 15th and I thought it was excellent....I'm an uber fan of the original but I felt this rendition was unique enough to stand alone and separate it from the '74 classic and still retain that uneasy, eerie atmosphere which was at the foundation of the original. It's a similar storyline and set-up but there's a copious amount of gruesome twists and turns along the way with some very disturbing images to keep any level of "Black Christmas" fan interested throughout. One notable scene where Kelli is wedged between the walls, pounding for help while the killer/s crawl toward her is one of the most claustrophobic, tense moments I've sat through since the closet scene of the original "Halloween". Plus, as a bonus I found that keeping one of the killers in the shadows then showing IT in the finale worked surprisingly well as this is one of the more imaginative and creepy cinema psychopaths in a long, long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas, a fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this last week and was pleasantly surprised. This was awesomely gory and scary. I honestly only watched this because of MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD. I think she's hot. So when she died I was heart-broken so very heartbroken. The gore scenes were really fun, the acting could have been better. Pretty girls dropping all over the place. I even made a story about this movie, it was with the American idol top 25, Antonella Barba, Haley Scarnato etc. Honestly the book wasn't that good, so I didn't publish it. Black Christmas was really gory and fun. I loved it so much, I cannot believe how many people dislike this movie, I mean 4.6. for the rating. O come on people lighten up. The people that think this is bad probably thinks that we are like related to the people that act and make this film. No Way Jose! Or at least not me. Believe ME! There is nobody that is famous that I know about. I really liked this movie and recommend it for those who like good gore mediocre acting and a good killer with a motive. 10 out of 10...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks the suspense and character development of the original, but still a good slasher flick on its own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of the original like I am--I believe it to be the best horror film EVER made--you may want to stay clear of this remake unless you can have an open mind. I knew that it was never going to surpass the original, so I went into the theater eager and curious to see just what exactly Glen Morgan would do with the story of little Billy and Agnes. Well, what he did was pretty much say "see ya" to the concept of the original and gave us a no-holds barred gore and slash fest that rivals anything seen in theaters in a long time. He also had no reservations about revealing EVERYTHING about the killer and his life, which I know has PO'ed fans of the original. After all, the effectiveness of the original lyed heavily in the fact that viewers knew almost NOTHING about the killer, except what he revealed on the eerie phonecalls.This film is quite short relative to the original and a lot of screen time is dedicated to the backstory of Billy and his agonizing childhood. While this is entertaining, what it does is take time away from the character development of the sorority sisters which the original spent a lot of time building. They really have no distinct personalities of their own (there is no Barb or Jesse type characters) but just seem like a blend of ALL characters from the original. I was even confused at points about which girl was what character?? The house mother, who was brilliantly characterized in the original (played in this version by Andrea Martin, an alumni of the original) isn't even developed very well at all. I was also disappointed at the "phone calls"-a staple of the original-which were almost left out of this version and the two or three that were thrown in were not nearly as creepy or disturbing as the original.However, when you get done comparing this remake-and we may just admit that it pales in comparison to the original-to the original-what you do have here is one hell of a fun movie. It's fast paced and certainly ominous in spots with some pretty disturbing and over-the-top deaths. It's almost like this didn't even need to be a remake--with a few tweaks, the film could have stood on it's own. The whole Christmas element is definitely played up more here, which makes the deaths and the situations that unfold just that much more disturbing. The killer is pretty creepy looking and pretty ruthless and brutal. The climax in the attic is flawless and has to be one of the best horror sequences on recent memory. I mean, a Christmas tree decorated with human body parts topped with a decapitated head??? However, the ending in the hospital felt tacked on and I wish the filmmakers could have thought of a different way to end the film. It didn't do the rest of the film justice.Overall, don't go to this thinking you are going to see the original because you're not. Also, don't go to this thinking you are going to see an Oscar contender because you are not. You are going to see a pure, 100% slasher film, full of clichés and all, so don't bitch when that is exactly what you get. My rating: 9 out of 10 judged on its OWN merit and not comparing it to the original. Have fun with this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying, this is by absolutely NO means scary. It is just a fun and gory way to kill time.I don't understand people's hate for this film. It's a LOT better than the shitty PG-13 remakes that have been sweeping the nation. Sure... it's nothing like the original but... It's definitely not a bad movie.My only problem with it is this... The main character (Katie Cassidy) does not have enough character development. She is a boring heroine. I wish they had made Melissa (Michelle Trachtenburg) the main character. She was a lot more interesting.Overall this was a halfway decent flick. Not scary. But definitely fun and entertaining.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a bit of of weird film to ponder - it is not scary or jumpy which is a huge minus for a horror film - it is oddly fun and entertaining which means that while it is not a memorable film and is nowhere near as good as the original it does make for a harmless night out.What also drags this film below the original is the back story given to the Billy character. What made the original so good was the fact that you never saw Billy fully and he could have been anyone - the fact that his background was never explained made him more menacing and disturbing than the new Billy in this version of the story and the phone calls made to the sorority house in the original where much more effective.That being said the story in this version of Black Christmas was entertaining and although the back story given to Billy and the fact you see him throughout the film took away the scares of the original it did offer a sick and twisted and oddly moving ride.The acting in the film was adequate for what it is and the characters are fun to watch. Overall this was a fun watch and nowhere near the train wreck that has been rumoured before its release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really fun Christmas horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this last month with my family, we have this semi-morbid tradition of watching the original 1974 movie every year during the holidays, so naturally I wanted to see this remake - and I was surprised! OK, OK, it's not as scary or serious as the original was - but that doesn't mean it wasn't fun! The story is reworked from the original with a few similarities, but is mostly it's own film. There are plenty of great scare moments and some really in-your-face violent scenes. The acting all around was great and I really liked all of the girls in the film, and felt bad for them when they met their untimely demises. The pace is quick and hardly lets up, and we get a lengthy back story on the killer, something the original kept a mystery. Plus there's a twisted sense of holiday spirit that can be found in this film. The original film is better in terms of a classic, quality horror movie, but this remake is just as good, but in a different way. You may say you didn't enjoy this film, but you can't say that it wasn't fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prepare for the Ultimate Slay Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2006 was arguably one of the best years for horror films in recent memory. Things started off with a bang in January with Eli Roth's Hostel and then came to a perfect close with the great fun of Black Christmas, a remake of the 1974 original. While many think that John Carpenter's 1978 flick Halloween was the movie that kick-started the slasher genre, Black Christmas was made four years earlier and used nearly the same premise. In fact, John Carpenter got the idea for the Michael Myers movie after checking out Bob Clark's film. This remake completely re-imagines the original in a fresh and unique way, in almost the same fashion that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake did. This remake is directed by horror veteran Glen Morgan (of the Final Destination trilogy), and features several up-and-coming actresses; Michelle Trachtenberg, returning to the horror genre after her three-year run on Buffy the Vampire Slayer; Lacey Chabert of 2003's Mean Girls; Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Crystal Lowe, both from this year's amazing Final Destination 3; and Katie Cassidy of this year's horrible When a Stranger Calls remake. Andrea Martin, who played Phyllis in the original film, also stars here as the sorority house mother.Black Christmas tells the tale of a group of sorority sisters holed up in a house together on Christmas. The sorority house was originally inhabited by the psychotic Billy, who slaughtered his mother and her lover in Christmas of 1991 and made their flesh into cookies. Billy escapes from the mental hospital and heads for his home, seeking new blood. Before long, the girls begin to get menacing phone calls from a mysterious caller. One-by-one, over the course of the night, the girls are killed off in a most grotesque fashion by a dark figure. Everything comes full-circle in a frightening conclusion.The new Black Christmas keeps the basic premise of the original, but modernizes it, adds a couple twists, a backstory, and an all-new ending. This remake contributes absolutely nothing new to the slasher genre, which may be what makes it so great. It fits perfectly with the mold of a great horror film: interesting premise, good characters, realistic gore and deaths, scary killers, a hint of black humor, a likable heroine, and a decent ending. It's all here. Each actress is perfectly cast in her role, and the few male characters, while most of them don't last long, aren't too bad, either. Glen Morgan mixes the thrilling realism he brought to the Final Destination films and mixes it with great cinematography, an eerie soundtrack, and interesting camera angles to make Black Christmas a very creepy and atmospheric film.With all of its elements combined, Black Christmas makes for a thrilling, creepy, and very fun horror film. Black Christmas was very surprising in that it was a better movie than the original. That said, this remake is certainly not for everyone. While The Descent remains the best horror film of the year, Black Christmas is certainly among the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas insults original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>okay so if you haven't seen the original 'Black Christmas' made in 1974, which is also one of the greatest and cleverest horror films of all time, then please go rent it and watch it before u lay your eyes on this obviously disgustingly horrible remake. I'm sorry to the makers of this film if I offended you but come on! The original Black Christmas was awesome! Till this day it stands as one of my favourite horror films and always will be, it's funny, it's realistic and scares the bejeezes outta ya! k now to list some things here that really bothered me bout this movie and I'm sure if u see it it'll bother u too: k for one the main character Cassidy whatever is the biggest fake and certainly insults Jessica Bradford's amazing performance in the original. She was real as could be, was believable and totally kicked ass in the conclusion. All this Kassidy girl does is strut around looking like she's got a stick up her butt the whole time, I mean come on it's Christmas..Smile, and other than that the only way she got this job is due to another cruddy remake 'When a stranger calls' in which we actually get to see her get it from the stalker guy. I mean jeez. k number two all character's act the same, talk the same, wear the same clothes I mean for the longest time I felt like I was on a Covergirl commercial. Stand still, look pretty and don't forget to scream when that dude comes after u OK. OK. The characters that I felt did the best job out of em all was Michelle Trachtenberg and Lacey Chabert who have both done amazing works previously before this one went rotten. In the original the eye peeking through the door scene is a classic screamer I mean when I first saw the original it scared me so much, I mean every time I look at a door now I think of it, but anyways in the remake it is way overused! I mean the point of the eye in the original was that u were'nt expecting it, it was brilliant and scary as hell. In the remake it's like okay we're gonna being seeing the eye again for the fifth time. The thing that really made Black Christmas what it was and earned it's name as a classic was that u never fully saw or knew who or what this guy was OR what he looked like, I mean was he deformed? who knows and u know whats good bout that I still donno, and that keeps tha creepiness. In the remake u know where this guy lives, what the heck he looks like, what he does, how he lived in the attic and ate his mom I mean thats just sickening! yea he makes cookies out of his mom's skin. The killer is not supposed to be cannabilistic for goodness sakes! and another thing there is two killers! yea two. In the original too the whole time this guy is killing people nobody knows about it until the creepy conclusion when there is only one person left, in the remake they all find out and team up and are all like "okay girls we gotta stick together", I think if i knew the whole time that there was some sick guy in the house, I would get out and call the police from a house far away. The last thing in the remake that really bothered me was the original "get out of the house, the call is coming from inside the house"(which has been ripped off quite a few times from the original in previous movies, not mentioning), it worked in the original because we didn't have complicated technology back then as we do today, we have a little thing called cellphones and star six nine, if a creepy guy is calling your phone and ur getting all flustered today *69 em. Anyways I'm done. but believe me see the original it is one of the greatest horror films you will ever see if ur a horror fan like me, don't waste ur time on this one.1 outta 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slap in the face for fans of the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching the remake of BLACK Christmas I told myself that I would view it as if it is an original film so I can give an opinion that isn't based on a ton of comparisons, because if you look at an original film and a remake you're still watching two completely different films despite any possible similarities.While watching this remake and seeing what they have done here, I couldn't help myself by saying this is going to slap fans of the original 1974 classic in the face, its like Glen Morgan took the original, tore it apart and put it back to together as a hack and slash fest that would've been better if it were another SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT sequel, this remake is basically a slasher through and through, it even contains all the trademarks of a slasher such as despicable stuck up characters that you wish would die just so the film would end, it has a main villain whose gone psycho from growing up in messed up household, it even as an 80's slasher type of score that lets you think about the good old days of horror.My recommendation for watching this film would be not to take it seriously and try not to compare it the original 1974 classic, otherwise you might find yourself speechless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boo these constant remakes filling modern horror features? well actually to tell the truth, for most part I actually didn't mind this recent remake (although some like to call these a re-imaginative) of the 1974 Canadian seasonal slasher 'Black Christmas', which was directed by Bob Clark. Don't get me wrong, as I do adore the original with it being one of my all-time favourite horror outings. I'm sure I will find myself in a very tiny minority, however this installment while inferior, remained mildly amusing, up until its bonkers last twenty minutes of silly revelations and one climax too many. The tone is a lot different, while the original was creepy and suspense driven with plenty of mystery behind the killer. On this occasion we get a considerably gruesome and unpleasant shocker (which can be a nasty piece of work), which goes on to over-explain the origin and motives in flashbacks of our killer? Billy. Still everything does have that one-dimensional feel (mainly surrounding the female victims) and the red herrings don't work because everything is shoved in your face that's its hard not to pick up. I liked the ambiguity the original went for, as for the remake I could live with the angle it headed for, but it didn't feel as unnerving as his character is painted out to be. The deaths scenes are over-the-top with its blood splatter and jolts, relating to a by-the-numbers body count formula of characters showing up to meet the meat grinder. The performances feel forced, due to a clash of (lacking) personalities and a rather self-knowing script. More time is spent delving into the billy character, than the girls. The headstrong cast featuring Katie Cassidy, Kristen Cloke, Michelle Trachtenberg, Crystal Lowe, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Lacey Chabert, Oliver Hudson and the lovely Andrea Martin give potent efforts even with their sketchy drawings. Director Glen Morgan (who also penned the overdone and contrived screenplay) adapts a shinny gloss to the visuals, capturing the neon lighting with a stylish colour scheme of the festive season, but also asserting a bleakly cold winter backdrop and an underlining darkness of impending doom. His pacing is quite spot on, with curious camera angles showing up and a clunky score that's a bit too much with the simple Christmas carols working out better. Overcooked, but a reasonably lukewarm sled ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superficial fun for slasher fans, not much else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing to be learned from failed remakes of movies like "Psycho" and "Halloween" (among others), it's that remaking a slasher classic (a.k.a. a film that still holds up today) is usually a terrible idea to begin with and almost always ends up a bust. Such is the case of "Black Christmas" (or ? gag ? "Black X-Mas"). While Bob Clark's original film might not be fit for the hip, younger audience that this remake was built for, it certainly holds its own in the league of classic slasher fare, making the choice to modernize it a sketchy one from the get-go. It helps that its got stylish direction from the usually solid Glen Morgan (one of the brains behind the "Final Destination" series and director of another remake, 2003's "Willard") and a cast that is easy on the eyes. If the intention was to churn out a new-age classic, then this is a failure. If "Black X-Mas" aims to be a slightly average slasher flick that numbs the mind for 90 minutes, then mission accomplished.The story is about a deranged killer, abused by his mother and recently escaped from a mental institution, who makes his way to a sorority house on Christmas Eve to pick off its residents in rather gruesome manners. The film intermingles back-story with current happenings, but loses its focus in the long-run. While it works as a straight-forward slasher flick that, had it been released in the late 90's, would've stood from the pack, "Black X-Mas" misses the mark completely with it's over-dramatic acting and convoluted story. The sad fact is that the narrative of the movie is weak, and only gets mildly interesting when blood is shed -- the tell-tale sign of a mediocre horror movie. So if you're in the market for some gratuitous violence and not much of anything else, maybe this sort of thing is your bag. The movie is a little too predictable to be genuinely tense, and despite some stylish directing, the substance just isn't there.While there is a wealth of potential in this flick ? talented director with a film that doesn't mind being cruel -- it ultimately ends up just another half-baked remake of a much better film. Slasher fans will find some giddy amusement in the stalk sequences and outlandish death scenes, but for the most part, it's sorely lacking in genuine suspense and (not surprisingly so) originality. It may eventually find its way as a guilty pleasure for some (heck, I enjoyed it on a superficial level) and is a fun movie to kill some time with even in the off-season. At any rate, it's better than most of the PG-13 remade junk that comes out a few times a year, but not much else can be said in its favor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I disagree with a lot of the other reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon reading the above reviews about this movie i don't agree with most of them. The new Black Christmas was based upon the original 1947 film but it did have its own twist. The movie was NOT exactly the same, there were few things that the movie did have in common with the original and it should have because it was a remake. All the girls lived in the sorority, there was a girl with an annoying b.f and some people (2) did die in the same way (plastic bag but even that was different and the unicorn statue.) I thought that the movie used the same foundation of the original which was girls in a sorority who are terrorized by a killer "billy" who lives in the house's attic. The movie did explore billy more and his childhood which i liked because you were able to learn more about him (abusive childhood)and they also added his sister/daughter into the story. This movie also added the random fascination with billy eating peoples eyes and decorating the tree with them, Also the director of the original black x-mas helped to create this one. I think that for a remake it is a pretty good attempt to redo the cult classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why Is everyone giving this such bad reviews? Is it just me who enjoyed it? I haven't seen the original so maybe that means something but I actually enjoyed this movie a lot! It might be because it had a lot of my favorite actresses in it.I had seen Michelle in Buffy and lots of things, Lacey in mean girls, Mary in sky high and Katie just as David's Daughter.I thought there acting was good, the script was good, the characters and killers where well written and there was some funny parts.To me it was like a cross between a chick flick and a slasher flick! Yeah, all the girls were dumb as hell and making lame decisions* but they're sorority girls, that was what they're supposed to do. Right? I was impressed with and enjoyed watching this movie!! 8/10&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3_ _ (I'll do hearts instead of stars) * Although I was confused by the way they said "we won't split up" then .... heather and Ms.Mac left, were killed in the car. Kelli and Leigh went to check on them without telling Mel she then went to find them heard Lauren scream (who was left alone in a bed through whole movie, she was obviously not going to survive!(eyes pulled out)) Mel then had her head chopped off with ice skate (ouch)/was dragged up to attic with eye sockets while screaming (double ouch).AND the wrong person/people survived, It should have been Leigh AND Melissa!!!!!! Those where the reasons i didn't give it 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to point out that this is not a good movie. It is not that well written, it is poorly acted, and some moments are laughable. However, that does not mean it's not a fun movie.What first turned me onto this flick was my adoration for the original and the cast which featured some of my fave actresses including Michelle Trachtenberg (Buffy and Eurotrip) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Grindhouse and Final Destination 3). That alone made the film decent.This remake follows along the same plot as the original. A bunch of girls in a sorority house getting picked off one by one by a serial killer. What makes this film different though is the amount of deaths, the amount of gore, and flashbacks to provide insight on the killer "Billy" never unmasked in the original.SPOILER ALERT: When it comes to the deaths I was a bit disappointed. The first few were actually pretty good. i have a fear of eyeball deaths so that was effective. But they kept re- using the same thing over and over again. Even the more "original deaths" felt used. Even though I'm not a big gore fan, the gore in this flick was really constrained. They could have gone out a LOT more!However, the direction for this film is amazing, some of the shots are spectacular and there a few good jump out moments, and the overall vibe of the flick is very creepy. If you aren't reading too much into this film, I think you'll have a grand ol' time watching it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1974 Black Christmas was one of my favourite all time horror movies, so I knew it was going to be tough for these film makers to remake this movie. I have so far seen it three times. Phrases like "I'll be home for Christmas, your my family now" still remain with me. It was more funny, then scary. The candy cane to the neck seen was awesome, and when the icicle fell from the roof, it will for make me look before I stand under a roof covered in icicle. There was A lot of blood, which made it look like Saw. The death scene we're the guy falls from the balcony and lands on the Christmas tree, and goes right through and you see his organs rapped around it. I really don't care what everyone else says I liked this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had 'Black Christmas' been made in the 1980s instead of the 70s this is how it may have turned out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that is present in just about every remake of a Horror classic is an increase in on screen violence and other forms of vulgarity. The original 'Halloween' and 'The Amityville Horror' eschewed the blood and gore in favor of suspense, atmosphere, and subtle shocks and very effectively. Now don't get me wrong here, I love the Horror films that embrace the nastiness too, but when remaking a film that was just fine without it you'd think the filmmakers would stay true to that. I saw 'Black Christmas' later in life and after seeing it and the trailer for this update I was more than a little excited. Even the negative reviews and poor Box Office couldn't keep me away. To my dismay the film was not all that great, at least that's how I felt the first time I saw it. Since then the film has grown on me and though I still think it inferior to the masterpiece that is the 1974 original, on its own it's a fun slasher flick that reminds you of ones from the 1980s.Pros: The acting is quite good considering the actors aren't given a lot to do. The kills are plenty, intense, and gory. There's plenty of that gore too. Writer/directed Glen Morgan creates a really dark and spooky atmosphere. Good twisted humor. Beautiful to look at thanks to the cinematography and many colorful and festive decorations. Moves at a fine pace. An interesting backstory, not to mention disturbing. Kudos to the filmmakers for making this remake faithful enough to the original, while still making it it's own movie. An exciting finale.Cons: Lacks the suspense and subtlety of the original. Characters are underdeveloped and some unlikable. Though interesting, the use of a backstory for the killer eliminates the mystery. Some things carried over from the original that were effective in it aren't so much here. Some plot holes.Final thoughts: The remake of the beloved Horror classic really has more in common with the 'Silent Night, Deadly Night' series. That's not to say it isn't fun to watch, it's just in a totally different league than it's predecessor. That film is subtle, suspenseful, and has depth whereas this remake is gory, demented, and often over the top. Being a remake of a film like that you'd think they wouldn't go this route. To be fair, the producers and studio called for re-shoots and editing that were against the director's wishes, which would explain some of the film's faults. Doesn't change the fact that the film is a lot of fun to watch, especially with friends at Christmas time.My rating: 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awesome Remake!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the remake of Black Christmas, for a couple of reasons. (1) It takes place on Christmas. (2) It's a slasher. (3) I saw this before I saw the original. I actually love this more than the original. I love the plot, it reminds me so much of my all-time favorite movie, HALLOWEEN! I love all the actresses, because they are all extremely hot! Some sorority sisters are snowed in on Christmas Eve at their house, and it happens to be the home of the psychotic killer, Billy Lenz. Their house mother, Miss Mac, who was in the original, tells them about what happened to Billy. I love when they show the flashbacks to Billy's abusive childhood, and how his mother raped him and kept him in the attic. They have a daughter named Agnes, and on one Christmas Eve, Billy finally took his revenge and killed his mother/lover's boyfriend, and killed her. It's awesome that he made Christmas cookies out of her skin. I also love the scenes at the asylum where Billy is kept in present day, but escapes and goes back home. Billy and Agnes have a Christmas slaughter and start killing the girls at their home. I also love that they took one of the girls' heads and made it the star on top of the Christmas tree. If you love remakes, horror, incest, cannibalism, and Christmas, you'll love BLACK Christmas!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Off Skipped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas, the latest entry in a long thread of horror remakes, is no different than any other. Pointless and unnecessary, Black Christmas follows the plot of the original, without maintaining any sense of spook or scare which the first one offered (the longest chase scene displayed here was somewhere along 20 seconds).Initially, the film seemed like a decent slasher film without many deficiencies. But after multiple viewings, and watching Bob Clark's stunningly macabre original take on the film, the reverence wears off, and the flaws start surfacing all but too blatantly obvious.For one, the backstory and insight offered to the audience regarding our killer, Billy, had gallingly sunk the level of enigma and mystique surrounding the character so low until the antagonist had become nothing but a one-dimensional killer whose inevitable fall you would be awaiting ever so restlessly as the minutes crawl by. Though certainly, he could not have been any worse than the boneheaded stick figures Morgan had standing around like dishes in an all-eyeballs-you-can-eat buffet whose actions scream, "Kill me now!".The exasperatingly predictable ending was so used and recycled over and over again that you'd be daft not to see the killer's encore in one brutal mortuary scene. I mean, come on, Hollywood! Spring for a new climax every once in a while.Moving on, performances by the band of ogle-able eye candies were stodgy at times, although a few of the leads did not do all that badly as relative newcomers standing so close to the spotlight. Katie Cassidy and Crystal Lowe did good jobs, seeing as how this is the first time they possess screen times greater than 15 minutes. Although we've seen better from Michelle Trachtenberg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (whose Texan accent seems to be on an on-off button throughout the film), they're not to be blamed completely. On a second thought, all of them performed ably, considering the poorly-written screenplay they were forced to reenact.However, not all is completely bad with the film. I, for one, remarkably found Black Christmas to be visually stunning and optically magnificent. It's a treat to the eyes, though not to the ears, as Shirley Walker's final score composition is not nearly as decent as could be, with the cues taking sharp turns up and down at supposedly "boo" moments (plus, one or two of them sounded like direct rip-offs from the musical cues in Mac's GarageBand). Nevertheless, the disorienting angles set up by Morgan is a job well down, as it gives the film a wonderful sense of eeriness and discomfort it would alternatively lack.Black Christmas's entertaining use of over-the-top gory spectacle also ends up in favor with the film, as it provides a sort of "campy" style one might find difficult to see in slashers nowadays since most of them would prefer to obtain a PG-13 rating rather than give viewers their money's worth. Despite that, the film's just one more eyeball-pop away from being labeled "torture-porn". Therefore, Morgan has found just the right equilibrium that keeps the film's gore at hand. Additionally, there are quite a number of decent and memorable kills here. And on that note, I'd also like to direct my sincerest kudos to Morgan for an eerily horrifying flashback sequence, concerning a rolling pin, a cookie cutter and fresh milk.The set and production designs were top-notch. They did a wonderful job in assuring that they get the feel and the look right. Although present sorority house may look comfy and cheerful, there's a hidden disquieting note, dubiously emphasized by excellent use of lightings. One more asset worthy to note is the film's short duration. Those not a fan of gore will only have to sustain 80 minutes of this film before the credits roll over. But then again, if you're not a gorehound, why even bother? Verdict: Despite Morgan's well intentions to recreate a strong slasher film from the 1970s, his visage of this re-imagination never succeeds to strike the right note. Regardless of some high points, Black Christmas is better off skipped, especially if you're not exactly a fan of carnage.</fullReview>

A boy who isn't wanted by his mother, turns into a sadistic killer, after witnessing his mother at a very young age kill his step-father, the mother proceeds to lock him in the attic for a very long time, now billy 21 or older now , starts to get revenge on the mother, and the sorority girls who now live in his house. he proceeds to pick them off on by one until.... well i can't give away the ending, but i was pretty pleased at how it went. there are no real superstars in this picture just a bunch of 20 something girls, that are at best average actors, more there i think for eye candy i think, some of the girls i just rooted for to die first. i didn't have really any problems with the movie at all, yeah it's a little campy, but better than the last scream movie i think, or those scary movie retreads, makes we want to see the original now, so i can compare the two side by side.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christmas Eve Night, a college sorority find themselves being stalked a murderous psychopath. Which the killer once lived in that house.Written and Directed by Glen Morgan (Willard "2003") made an amusing if somewhat unexpectional remake of the cult classic Canadian horror film of the same name. Writer/Director:Morgan manages to fleshed out the character Billy (Played by Robert Mann), which in the original character remained an mystery. Also the remake features plenty of violent death scenes, a few surprises and some humorous twisted dark comedy. The cast is good here, including:Katie Cassidy, Kristen Cloke, Oliver Hudson, Michelle Trachtenberg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Lacey Chabert, Crystal Lowe and Andrea Martin. Which Martin appeared in the original movie as one of the sorority girls.The picture didn't play well at the box office and writer/director:Morgan (Although it's rumored) that he didn't liked the final product of his own film. The remake does have a few flaws and the conclusion is one of the them, which isn't satisfying at all. Still, the remake will found an audience on DVD and it will probably become an cult film. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Unrated Version is now released on DVD, it is actually more satisfying. Which it seems to be the original version of what Morgan's intended cut. Some scenes has been changed and the conclusion is much more satisfying than the original theatrical release. The two disc set has plenty of interesting features, including scenes were differently in other countries as well. Disc two has Two Featurettes, Deleted Scenes and Three Alternate Endings. Although the cult possibilities of this remake would not the same as the original. Since the remake is loosely based on the 1974 movie But it will certainly make an interesting double bill. Bob Clark, who directed the original and he recently died in a car accident. He was one of the executive producers of this remake. Super 35. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, just watched this and I liked this movie... I liked it a lot! But... I watched it eating pop-corn and I didn't expect too much blood in it! You know, there are blood everywhere besides the times (there are a bunch of times) that Billy eats the eyes of his victims. I almost puked! Well, here I'll put what did like and what i did not like in this movie: WHAT I DID LIKE: * The story - Nice, very nice story.* The plot - You know, a mother has sex with his own son 'cause her husband slept while they were having it... well... you don't see this everyday... at least in a movie you don't see it.* The Billy's yellow skin - It's original! Never heard about someone baring with yellow skin. But, anyways, it has nothing to do with the plot or something, I guess the writer just made this to who watches don't confuse someone with Billy. Then you can know who's Billy and who's somebody else.* You can know this is the remake - There are cell phones used. It could be the sequel. Well, I did not watch the 1974 one, but, I can assure you: that one hadn't cell phones. They didn't even know that a thing like cell phone could exist in the future... well, they also thought that times that in 2000 everybody could go to space and come to earth and go there again whenever they felt like it. Well, in 2000 we hadn't lotta technology, even in 2007 we haven't! Well, back to subject, I liked this point.Well, I guess that's it.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: * Too much dirty words - They say f**king here, f**king there... b**ch, s**t... well "s**t" isn't a real dirty word, but I don't like to hear it... but... expression freedom! * Too much blood - WoW! There are more blood than movie! Well, what could I expect from an horror movie? * Eyes eater Billy - Billy eats eyes! Ill! That's very very very very very very very very very very very very ill! I almost puked my pop-corn watching it.Well... I guess that's why I voted "8". But I really recommend! Rent the DVD, download from Internet, do what you wanna do, but... watch it. Another thing, the MPAA said that there are nudity, so, if you're a pervert and wanna see the movie just to see an **s........... there are, innit. I just wanted to make you quit watching, you perverts, but I realized that there are nudity, innit. Well, I could not say that the MPAA were wrong, or they could come 'ere and arrest me or something, just like they did with the documentary 'This Film Isn't Yet Rated' that has the sells cancelated.Recommended by me :) See ya'll later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On my way to see this movie, I was really excited about it. The original was and still is my favorite horror movie of all time and I usually love all those movies.I have to say I enjoyed it, but I know it could have been better. For example, the kills; gory yes, but quite repetitive. The director had over 6 girls to kill, one could have thought he would have used this opportunity to show us 6 chase scenes and 6 different ways of killing someone. The actresses were all great, but I particularly loved Crystal Lowe's character, although she wasn't really used to her full potential. It was entertaining, fast-paced and funny. My main problem was those scenes written RESHOOTS all over. The ending was pretty lame and the editing, especially during the flashbacks, was not great. But all in all , BLACK Christmas is a good movie, but could have been great. Maybe we'll get the real director vision on DVD.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad. Don't think about the original, take this for what it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have to admit that I'm a loyal almost obsessed fan of the original "Black Christmas". I praise it as one of the most chilling and well done Horror movies in the history of the genre.The remake isn't by any means a terrible movie. It tried too hard in order to keep a fast pace filled by grizzly murders, interesting flashback scenes that explain the serial killer's motives, and really good camera angles.Visually, this remake is very good because it mixes the dark tone of the movie with colorful Christmas situations. Since the first scene we learn that we're going to be witnessing a brutal slasher.Truth, there is no tension, mystery, or chilling scenes unlike the original. But let's keep in mind that this is a straight slasher with no intentions of becoming something relevant. I mean, it's a pointless remake that perfectly caught the success of new slashers.Kudos for the cast for being the hottest in probably the history of slasher cinema! All of the girls were extremely hot, sexy, and also proved to be decent actresses. I mean, all of them damnit.The gore is very good and the killings are nasty. Billy was really mad. I think that the eye gouging thing was exaggerated for a while but it gave us an idea of Billy's mental state.The Billy/Agnes character exploration had potential and only worked half of it's intentions. Billy is the killer to fear, the main character. He was kept in the shadows in the original and this time he's on his prime time. Agnes was a useless character that was intended to bring the shock feature to the plot twist.Still I recommend this movie for those who are into this new wave of Horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Black Christmas, the original from the 70's, I was just left with chills, I couldn't wait for the remake. I remember seeing the trailer for this a little while ago and it looked so scary, so I was assuming this one would be more gory and have some more jumpy moments than the original Black Christmas, unfortunately it juts ruins the original story of Black Christmas. I was really disappointed with the whole "let's make the killer mean something to the story", it does work for certain movies, but for a good slasher film, I like it when the killer doesn't have a certain motive, they're just a crazy psychopath, it makes them a little more scary like Michael Myers, no soul, no conscience, just kill for the sake of killing. Not to mention a lot of this movie didn't make any sense, also the girls were less likable, you actually rooted for them to get killed. The story was just weak and lacked the originality of the first Black Christmas, even if it is a remake.It's the Christmas season, some sorority girls have decided to stay on campus in their house rather than go home. They exchange stories of a mysterious boy who disappeared in their home town and never came back home, just having fun with each other, but things get creepy when they start receiving phone calls from a mysterious stranger, but he's using the girl's cell phone numbers as a caller ID. When a few of the girls go missing, Katie, one of the girls left over, decides to find out what's really going on, but she may not wanna find out what's going on in her own sorority house.Over all the movie does deliver on the gore, it's not completely terrible, but the problem is that it just made the original story not as much fun. Like I said, the girls are not likable in this movie, they're pretty stupid and you just can't wait for them to be killed off. But the death scenes were pretty cool, a little bit cooler than the original some aspect, I know I'll get a lot of hate for that, but you gotta love a little gore, it's a scary movie after all. I wouldn't really recommend it though unless you're in the mood for some mindless scares that don't really get to you. Stick to the original, I know I will for sure.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for a slasher film it's actually not bad...i wouldn't say its as good as remakes like the Texas chainsaw massacre or Halloween but its worth a look...the most interesting thing about this film is that unlike other films that use creepy music like the ones used in most horror/slasher films it actually uses Christmas songs and Christmas music to scare you...and it works... before a death scene you start hearing this music and instead of feeling happy you know that something bad is going to happen...there are annoying things in the film like the light...many times the light is either red or blue....and most of the killing scenes are the same...its happening over and over and it kind of makes you bored...and to a certain point you could leave and come back and know that you're not going to miss anything interesting cause you've already seen it...many times...so if you're expecting a good horror film stay away cause there's nothing real scary about the film...its gory but that is not very scary...if you just want to have fun watching a slasher film with lots of gore and violence then it definitely worth a look..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst Horror film remakes ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a film that left me with a great feeling of sadness and disgust. BLACK Christmas is a film that should be avoided. It is a completely immoral and grotesque mess of a film. I don't know how this film was allowed to be made! I felt so sick to my stomach while watching it and I really hope that nobody makes the mistake of seeing it thinking it will be another fun and cheesy slasher film. It is not a fun and cheesy slasher film. It is an exercise in human cruelty, brutality, abuse, and humiliation. I feel bad for all of the teens who went to the theater to see this film expecting a scary, exciting, and fun slasher film and instead got a disgusting portrait of inhuman behavior. I don't know what went wrong with this film. I think Glen Morgan is a great film director and I loved his WILLARD film. The original BLACK Christmas by Bob Clark is basically the template for all slasher films of today. I don't know who screwed this film up or who's responsible for it being so screwed up, nor do I care. I just want to forget that I ever saw it. I know that I'll never be able to rid my mind of it, however, and wish I had never even toyed with the idea of seeing it. The film has generally the same basic plot as the original. However, the origin of the killer is explained in full graphic detail. Billy was a boy whose skin turned yellow. His mother was so shocked by it that she murdered his father in front of him and then locked him away like an animal. She remarried and then one night, when her husband falls asleep, she goes up to where she locked her son up and raped him. She gave birth to his sister/ daughter sometime later. Eventually, Billy gets so fed up with the abuse that he escapes from his prison, attacks him sister/daughter, and eats her eye. He then murders his stepfather and mother and then cannibalizes them utilizing a cookie cutter to carve out chunks of their flesh to cook in the oven and then proceeding to eat. He gets locked away and his sister/daughter is never heard from again. Does this sound like a fun slasher film? I mean, we already have child abuse and rape, cannibalism, and incest. Well the film also has elements of voyeurism and eye gouging later on, so chances are this won't be a good holiday picture. In addition to all this ugliness and freakish behavior, we have several relentlessly disgusting death scenes. Of course there is a lot of eye gouging and cannibalistic mayhem going on. Seemingly endless amounts of young women are tortured and mutilated before the halfway mark. There is ever a single person we can get to like because they get killed so damn quickly. The kills in this film happen WAY WAY WAY too fast. There's just killing, slaughtering, and cannibalizing happening one after the other in scene after scene and after the first few we completely lose track of who's alive and who's dead. Eventually almost all of the characters die, nor does the brutality and mayhem stop there. The film feels like it lasts for hours and hours and is so repetitive and excessively gory that there is no fun to be had watching this madness. It is a freak show of a film and I can't recommend it to the average moviegoer. Sorry, but this is a definite miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly underrated effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Black Christmas" is a thoroughly entertaining and quite surprisingly good remake.**SPOILERS**Stuck in their sorority house, Kelli Presley, (Katie Cassidy) Melissa, (Michelle Trachtenberg) Heather Fitzgerald, (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) Dana, (Lacey Chabert) Lauren Hannon, (Crystal Lowe) Megan Helms, (Jessica Harmon) Clair Crosby, (Leela Savasta) and Eve Agnew, (Kathleen Kole) as well as House Mother Barbara MacHenry, (Andrea Martin) try to make the best of the snowed-in situation. Growing tired of their tradition of leaving a present for a former resident of the house, and even after being told of the tragedy does nothing to brighten their moods. As the night grows longer, they are continuously inundated with mysterious phone calls, and begin to realize that the members are slowly disappearing. Beginning to suspect that they're being targeted by a sadistic killer, they try everything they can to get out of the situation before falling prey to the strange killer.The Good News: It's surprising how entertaining this one is. The main point this one has is that it's far more violent and gory than expected. This one here includes a lot more brutality in the kills than before, and they're a fine sight to see, adding an extra depth to the killer in that they're willing to go to such barbaric depths than required. It really shouldn't have been that graphic, but the fact that it gets there is so greatly appreciated. In here, we get a candy cane stabbed in the neck, a pointed Christmas Tree ornament stabbed through the eye and out the back of the head, strangled with a strand of Christmas Tree lights, whacked in the head with a garden trowel, being set on fire, as well as having numerous victims getting their eyes gouged out, both actively done on-screen as well as being found that way, and there's even some in here that are killed off-screen but leave a giant blood-stain where they're killed. Then there's the ultra-brutal scene where one of the victims is dragged away from the scene, still alive, by the hollowed out eye sockets. It's a spectacular sight and really puts over the brutality of the killer nicely. It even gets a little creepy at times. The scene where the police drag away the killer to the mental institution after they find him eating 'skin' cookies he's made from his Mother's corpse, all washed down with a glass of milk, is truly unsettling, merely at the calmness which is displayed during the act. The remake uses the same technique towards the calls, where a cacophony of noise and heavy breathing is heard on the other end. The incessantness of them are what drive up the tension, as they pop up out of nowhere and make for some of the best suspense tactics ever used. This even has one nice update in that the killer uses the cell phone of the girl just killed to taunt the others. It's a really nice trick that keeps the suspense going and makes for some really good scenes as they turn on each other trying to get to the bottom of the calls. The action in here is another spectacular plus, with plenty to enjoy about it and getting in some wonderful moments. The assault on the girls, when they first find out about the killer, is great and the confrontation under the house in the basement is fantastic. The main one, though, is the greatness of the battle up in the attic. This is a full-on exciting action sequence, getting in plenty fun moments and a nice back-and-forth with both sides having the upper hand at some point. The pacing here is also top-notch, keeping it from getting boring without managing to get too concerned with the action to the exclusion of all else. It's a fun ride and gets plenty right, making this one really enjoyable.The Bad News: This one really doesn't have a whole lot of flaws to it. The fact that this one decides to include the subplot about the killer's back-story is one such example, as this one makes two big problems at once. The main one is that it really makes the killer much less threatening. It's fine to give a little bit about them in an attempt to make them seem a little human, yet this one gives out too much and in the end too much knowledge manages to ruin the great job of making him seem like a really imposing threat up until that time. The other big problem is that they're shown as several lengthy flashbacks that pepper the first half of the film. The inclusion of these, placed in the positions where they are, hamper the flow of the present day action to a great degree. It should've been given as just one big long one rather than the three-to four that are present, since it disrupts the momentum to switch over from the action to go back to the back-story when it could've been given as just one scene. The sheer fact that this particular film is being remade might be something for others to get after, but it's not as valid an excuse as the film's other big flaws.The Final Verdict: Getting over the fact that this is actually a remake, there's plenty in here to enjoy and make this one thoroughly entertaining. See this if you're in a mood for a marathon of festive-theme films, a fan of the remake craze or of modernized slashers, while those who are simply outraged at the thought of this one being remade should steer clear anyway.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and a mild sex scene</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dreadful remake of Bob Clark's classic seasonal slasher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never really been a huge fan of Bob Clark's '74 proto-slasher; I can see its importance as an influential movie, and found it to be a fairly creepy affair, but fail to understand the level of devotion it gets from many horror fans. However, compared to the remake, the original is an absolute masterpiece of terror.Black Christmas '06 is typical of the current trend for rehashing old scary films: it dispenses with what made the original effective, throws in some good looking teens and a splash of gore and sits back as undemanding audiences lap it all up.In typical slasher style, a group of ridiculously gorgeous, but still rather bland teens/twenty somethings, who are spending Christmas in their frat house, are killed off by an escaped lunatic named Billy. Additionally, in a series of flashbacks, the audience learns about the bizarre history of the killer and what exactly makes him tick.The film dispenses with logic from the word go: Billy is incarcerated in one of those institutions that only exist in horror films?poorly lit and staffed by complete morons. Despite his attempts to break out every Christmas, not one person thinks to stake out his old home after he finally escapes (the frat house is where Billy was raised). The film is also extremely dark, with no-one pausing to turn on the lights in the house (eventually, there is a power cut?but up until that moment...).Black Christmas '06 is obviously aimed at teens: the vapid cast look good (Michelle Trachtenberg and Lacey Chabert are clearly a couple of honeys, but unfortunately their acting ability is severely limited); there is quite a bit of gruesome gore (they've got to compete with the Saws and Hostels, after all); and the silly ending is your typical 'sole survivor vs. the bad guy' set-up.Admittedly, the makers do try to add the occcasional original and rather twisted moment (the incestuous mother, the killer's inexplicable eyeball fetish, and the fact that Billy is yellow!), but on the whole, this is lazy, by-the-numbers film-making that deserves to be vilified by horror fans worldwide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Slasher Fun...*UK* and *US* Versions....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie yesterday and have to say, it's a great slasher flick and is the best slasher we've had in a while. I will say though, I am a little disappointed with the version I saw, but I will be checking out the other version when I see it -- hopefully I will love it more. The story is simple. A psychotic man named Billy Lenz escapes a mental institution on Christmas -- 15 years after he murdered his abusive mother and stepfather. Meanwhile, a group of sorority sisters and their house mother are snowed in their sorority house in a snowstorm --and it's not just their house -- it's Billy's childhood home. A body count follows and the sorority sisters try to make it out alive. I'll start with the positives. The movie has an amazing cast, including Lacey Chabert, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Crystal Lowe and everyone does great in the movie, well Oliver Hudson does OK -- but is definitely not great. The movie also has lots of blood and gore for horror fans to be pleased with, plenty of brutal death scenes and the movie is very gory! The movie also has some humor in a few scenes, which raised some smiles to my face, and the finale in the attic is awesome! It's also great we see a lot more of Crystal Lowe, an amazing actress, who had more screen time I thought she would. I also must admit, the killer in the movie is actually scary, and a damn great killer. Now the very few negatives I had with the movie. Oliver Hudson is kinda an annoying character, and his acting is OK -- but nothing too bad to hurt the movie. I also felt that the movie's ending perhaps needed to be a little more serious than it was, the original is very serious and I'm not comparing them -- but maybe it needed some more seriousness for the ending possibly. I also felt the ending I saw was good, but rushed and abrupt, it could have been better. *Note I previously said that I thought Mary and Lacey needed more screen time, well I think different after seeing the movie again and realizing that for an 80+ min horror movie, they have plenty of screen time*. Anyway, my verdict is it's a great slasher movie, just watch it for the pure enjoyment and horror fun!. It's a little bit disappointing, but I hear there's another version being released -- which I might just be giving a higher rating when I see it! Hopefully I will.8/10 (UK Version)Update (January 1st 2007) - I've just watched the US version of the movie which is a few minutes longer and is different and I have to say, it's better! I love the new death scenes and the ending is more thought out and more better, whereas the UK ending was the main problem I had with the UK version. The US ending, however, still isn't great - but I like it more than the UK, mainly because it isn't as rushed -- that's practically the main reason why. Oliver Hudson isn't as bad I felt, he's a good enough actor (not the best, far from the worst), just has an annoying character, but hey don't most movies? I was also happy with the screen time Mary and Lacey received, they did have more than I thought they did the first time I saw the movie. I am really happy I love the US version more, it may be only a few minutes longer and two scenes may be entirely different, and lets say -- they did it right! It just comes to show, that a short amount of time can make a movie even better! Still has its flaws, but it's still great!8/10 (US version)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i just came back from watching this film in London and i thought it was kinda cool. me being a huge horror nut that i am, thought it was a tab bit tack-less and predictable but still worth the watch. The acting isn't Oscar worthy, but for a group of young up-coming actress's it was OK. The script can be predictable at some points but then goes the other way and leaves you a bit gob-smacked. if you're like me alone this Xmas and wanna have a bit of a laugh and a good scare and have you biting your nails in anticipation of what may happen next then watch this film. WARNING: This is a film i think mainly horror fans will get a kick out of, if you're going to be judgmental then don't waste your money - this one is for the fans. have a black Christmas!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you expect this to be anything like its original film, then you better watch out, you better not cry, you better not pout I'm telling you why. Black Christmas remake here is pretty much straight forward on delivering the blood and hot chicks getting slaughter one by one rather than building up the scare like the original film. However, it has its effort in doing so but still it's just too silly and quite unintentionally funny and laughable in couple of scenes. The GORES here are pretty much satisfying enough even though it looks fake but it's just purely to make it gleefully fun for horror fans. It does borrow some elements from the original version and tries to be SCARY but ultimately fails most of the time. Nonetheless what I really admire this film for is the tone and lighting which really gives a grisly festive mood and makes it quite visually appealing to watch throughout. Overall, this is slasher Christmas-themed film that's gleefully offensive in its content and bloody silly enough to be remembered as another fun, brainless, and cheesy movie suitable for you naughty peeps to watch on Christmas and ruins all the good-spirit of this festival.&gt;&gt;C+&lt;&lt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The landmark 1974 Canadian slasher "Black Christmas" gets re-imagined for the 21st century movie audience, with poor to fair results. The basic story is the same: a savage psychopath is on the loose in a sorority house during the Christmas holidays, and the girls who are still around begin to be terrorized and ultimately slaughtered. Director Glen Morgan, an 'X-Files' veteran who'd previously guided the remake of "Willard", is smart enough to pay homage to the original film at times, but the obscene phone calls that were so fascinating the first time around aren't nearly as freaky or effective. The biggest problem is that Morgan, who also wrote the screenplay, does the same sort of thing that Rob Zombie would do a year later for the "Halloween" update, giving us way too much back story on a killer who worked much better when we knew next to nothing about him. Granted, the back story is somewhat amusing (if also clichéd) in terms of twisted details. The story tries to keep us guessing by utilizing red herrings but fails to deliver any real surprises as it plays out. Another problem is that most of the victims here are not worth caring about - they're varying degrees of unpleasant. Morgans' dialogue ain't so hot, to boot. On the plus side, there's good wintertime atmosphere, and a quick pace; this largely takes place in one night so there's not much of a wait to get to the action. Undemanding genre fans who are happy anytime there's ample gore and sadism in what they watch will also find enough to keep them entertained. Shirley Walker (who receives a special "goodbye" credit, having passed away after production but before the release) does the thunderous music; the composition "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" also becomes a recurring motif. The acting is adequate from all concerned - no more, no less - although it is nice to see Andrea Martin, one of the sorority sisters in the '74 film now cast as the house mother. The girls are certainly all attractive enough. All things considered, this is okay entertainment, although Morgan would have done better to not give his film two climaxes. The resolution is very much to the point, and is therefore not nearly as chilling as the ending to "Black Christmas" '74. That films' director, Bob Clark, was one of the executive producers here. Five out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not even nearly as bad as people have let me know. I'd definitely say this is one of the better slasher remakes along with Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre although there were several things I didn't like. The original Black Christmas was just so good that its hard to top being extremely creepy and atmospheric and also with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre the first slasher film.The remake makes numerous changes to the story but I don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave that for you to find out (basically they just wanted to expand on the story of the original) its just a gorier,more straight forward less eerie version of the original and it also makes it exclusively clear who the killer is which is a real shame since one of the original film's great innovations was to make it a total mystery that never gets solved (although I understand they had to do something different from the original). Also the killer "Billy" looks retarded. He's supposed to have some rare disease or something that makes his skin yellow and that just looks silly. The remake doesn't have the same charm and class as the original but it does try to capture some of that and also re-create the eerie atmosphere. It was pretty fun but I wouldn't really recommend it unless you're a hardcore fan of the original Black Christmas like I am.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas is a very beautiful film- it features stunning girls, some wonderful camera shots, and very much captures the Christmas feel- the movie is positively awash with reds and greens. There's no denying it's a feast for the eyes.It's a shame because Black Christmas is such a beautiful looking, sleekly filmed movie, I WANT to like it. However, as we all should know, a film should be about more than just aesthetics and despite what appears to be some high production values and a relatively tight 80-something minute running time, the film plods and manages to feel rather dull. I think a major factor is the characters- or supposed characters, as they don't feel like characters at all. We meet a sorority house full of girls, some disposed of sooner than others, and yet it's hard to distinguish them- a few sassy lines aside, and this isn't helped by the fact they all look incredibly similar. I guess this is the price you pay for the Hollywood trend of focusing on beautiful looking people, rather than those conveying an, at least vaguely, interesting persona.The original Black Christmas fleshed out the girls far more- they had lives outside the confines of the sorority house they were likable, funny, occasionally downright bitchy or crude- but essentially you found yourself caring for these girls. The remake attempts to do this- there is a subplot featuring a sex tape and love-rat boyfriend, apparent tension amongst some of the girls, but these are fleeting and , because ultimately we don't especially care about the girls, these don't strike an emotional chord. I suspect the writing was more focused on the back-story of the killer than the people we were actually supposed to be rooting for- the heroine is the ultimate in non descript and bland.In a similar fashion to the recent remake of When a Stranger Calls, the vast majority of the action now takes place in the house itself. Whereas one would expect a build up of tension, claustrophobia and dread, both fail miserably. What we find instead is beautiful on the eye, but something that feels altogether overly long and rather routine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original so unlike most people i didn't know what to expect accept a slasher movie. I do like horror movies and this one i did like. It wasn't exactly predictable which i hate about some horror movies so was already a OK movie in my opinion. There was also a lot of suspense about the film which is also good. I really like the fact that the Christmas spirit couldn't really escape you as well, Christmas music was playing when the movie built up suspense which was quite chilling as the music played is so familiar but never associated with anything like horror, or well shouldn't be. From the start of the movie it was unclear who would actually die, which is pretty obvious to me in most horror movies. Usually the nice virginal one survives n the hot and naughty people die. Suppose it's kind of a moral thing. Anyways this film was full of suspense and gore which in a horror movie is the important thing. Inspite of the horrible things billy had done, the in-depth background of the character really allowed to feel sorry for the guy but only for a few minutes. The acting of the film was overall really good, the characters where all believable enough and they were believable in the situation. There was not much in-depth of the girls' characters which i don't think was wise as i didn't really feel that sorry for them so the gore made less of an impact, it wasn't so shocking. Overall i thought it was a good film and quite scary and suspenseful. So go watch!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well its not the original but it is good gory horror fun. The plot is simple: psychopathic killer slashes a bunch of cute girls in a sorority on Christmas Eve. However, in this rendition we actually see who the killer is, where he came from and why he's so sick in the head. This movie is somewhat scary but lacks the originality is predecessor had, the mysterious killer you never see, the execution-style deaths and the whole concept of killing at Christmas. This remake was good but not new.The "Scare Factor" was there but not enough. I guess some of the scares are cliché however they upped and twisted the whole creepy phone call. The intermissions that showed who the killer is were scary and very odd. So there were new scares but not living up to the reputations of the original. The gore was there and a little silly but nonetheless scary. I jumped?.once. But it was all in good fun and I appreciate that.The acting was bad, but like all other remakes of horror films, I'm not surprised. It had a great cast of young females and the funny head of the sorority is priceless. It's corny, cheese, fun, goofy, gory, scary and not bad for a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'd Like To Bury The Hatchet With My Sister?Right In Her Head!" --- Dana (Lacey Chabert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Black Christmas" (2006) Directed By: Glen Morgan Starring: Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachtenberg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Lacey Chabert, Kristen Cloke, Andrea Martin, Crystal Lowe, &amp; Kyle Hudson MPAA Rating: "R" (for strong horror violence and gore, sexuality, nudity and language) In 1974, a low-budget horror film named "Black Christmas" came and?well, in all honesty, it was completely ignored. In fact, it has never really had the recognition it deserves, except from the most hardcore horror fans. People remember "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", and "A Nightmare on Elm Street"?but hardly anyone remembers "Black Christmas" even though it practically invented the slasher genre. I have always been a huge fan of the classic and I recently got my "Special Edition" DVD?for a Christmas present, ironically enough. And how did I decide to spend the day after Christmas, you ask? Well, watching the remake in a crowded theater, of course. I didn't expect anything from this movie. After all, it was a remake and, on top of that, it had several reported re-shoots (something that often means greedy studio execs decided to ignore the filmmakers' original wishes). However, I knew that, if nothing else, this movie had an ample cast and a wonderful director behind it. So, did this remake completely blow me away like the original?or was it frozen in its tracks? If you have ever seen the original movie, then you know the plot for this. A group of sorority sisters, including Kelli (Cassidy) and Melissa (Trachtenberg), and their house mother, Ms. Mac (Martin), are all celebrating the Christmas season, when a series of increasingly threatening phone calls ruins the party. They soon discover that a brutal and terrifying killer has come home for Christmas and is killing them off one by one. In the original, the killer is never identified. His motives are never even mentioned and he is never really seen, except when masked in shadows. This remake doesn't want to hide who the killer is or why he or she desires to kill the girls. We are given all sorts of flashbacks and everything about the killer's past is revealed. While most fans of the original detest this fact and feel that this is just another example of how cinema is being dumbed down for audiences, I don't necessarily mind. This movie reminds me of horror films from the eighties. It gives us a killer and his motives?and then a cast of victims for him to kill. Like those, this movie isn't scary and it isn't particularly intelligent, but it is fun and entertaining enough?not to mention, perfectly gruesome and violent.The gore in this movie is ratcheted up a lot in comparison to the original. In fact, this movie is a slap in the face to all of the other PG-13 horror films released lately and has some actual brevity. "Black Christmas" (2006) features some of the bloodiest and most violent deaths to be showcased in a horror movie this year. Gore-hounds will have a very merry Christmas, as they get everything from eyeballs being pulled out, severed heads, various amputations, impalings, stabbings, and more blood splatters to count. In an age when PG-13 horror films have been dominating cinemas, I am glad to see a movie with a hardcore R-rating. Though not as shocking as such films as "The Hills Have Eyes" (2006), "Hostel", and "Haute Tension", for a movie aimed predominately at teen audiences, it seems as though filmmakers have finally realized that teenagers can handle a little bit of blood in horror movies. Many people in my theater were squealing in revulsion and I suspect that, for general audiences, this is quite shocking.When "Black Christmas" (2006) ended, I realized that it paled in comparison to the original and replaced any tension and suspense with blood and gore, but that it was still a competent enough slasher flick. Simple and entertaining, "Black Christmas" (2006) is reminiscent of such eighties slasher flicks as "Terror Train", "Prom Night", and the many "Friday the 13th" sequels. Do not expect to see this at the Academy Awards, but, as far as modern slasher flicks go, you could do worse. "Black Christmas" (2006) is a fun, entertaining, darkly-humorous, bloody, gruesome, and violent slasher flick that sports decent performances, some stylish direction from Glen Morgan, and a lightning-quick pace. My biggest problem is that the ending is a little too drawn out and I feel that everything should have been brought to a close within the sorority house rather than taking it to a nearby hospital. On top of that, there was a little unnecessary melodrama right at the beginning that didn't mean a hill of beans by the end. But, overall, "Black Christmas" (2006) will be finding a place on my shelf right next to its predecessor?if only for the entertainment factor (and, really, that's all there is?but that is enough).Final Thought: "Black Christmas" (2006) doesn't revolutionize the genre as its predecessor did, but it's a fun and immensely entertaining movie.Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a patch on the original but still enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when I heard that Black Christmas was being remade, I was psyched. The original is one of the best suspense slashers ever and even though the original is close to flawless, I felt like a remake could add some fresh elements to the concept. Unfortunately for me, this remake removed everything that made the original chilling and suspenseful and replaced it with cheap gore, bitchy girls and a ridiculous back-story.The main plot is basically the same, only this time it's not a suspense-thriller, it's a generic and cheesy slasher flick which offers nothing new to the genre. Hell, it's so generic that I asked myself; why even call it a remake? It's just another dime-a-dozen slasher flick. Now, I usually enjoy generic slasher flicks so let me explain to you just why I disliked this one so much.While the original focused on making Billy mysterious and creepy, this remake gives Billy a ludicrous and unnecessarily long back-story which pretty much removes everything that made Billy's character creepy. I think everyone will agree with me on that point. Then there's the cast, which is brilliant really but is a complete waste of talent since their characters are all flat and bitchy - not to forget completely unlikeable. They call themselves sisters, but I've heard of killers that were more friendly than these chicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas is a really fun movie with good gore and hilarious dark comedy. Don't get me wrong, Black Christmas is a terrible film, but take it is a fun film. Not scary, but at points, tense and suspenseful. Don't expect the original because it's far from it. I like that to some extent because it makes it its own movie and thats really unique. Of course, being different, doesn't change it in all good ways. Many scenes could've been very intense but were let down because of the sudden comedy. If you do compare the original to this, i do think you will not like this movie. The original is scary, at points, and fans of the original WILL be expecting this to meet up to its standards. Don't compare it. The remake is its own movie and is meant to be fun and entertaining. It succeeds in that. If you are a fan of horror and are wanting to watch a fun, entertaining film, then you will enjoy this. Black Christmas is fun, gory, suspenseful, over the top, and entertaining. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BLACK XMAS 2006 (KATIE CASSIDY, MICHELLE TRACHTENBERG, OLIVER HUDSON, ROBERT MANN) DIRECTED BY: GLEN MORGAN ~ THE RUNDOWN: Morgan takes a big ol' Christmas sh*t on the first one and goes all out, decking the halls with boughs of 'gory' in this 80s-style throwback. ~ Finally, enough with that PG-13 horsesh*t; the WHEN A STRANGER CALLS remake this year was atrocious, as well as the pathetic WICKER MAN remake. Thank God Glen Morgan has some class! The critics may not ever like him but the 03 WILLIARD remake was quite possibly the best remake of any genre since Carpenter's THE THING, and, for what it is, BLACK XMAS is a grand success. Sure, the acting's generic, the plot's muddled, and it doesn't come close to capturing the creepy, suspenseful aura of the original that influenced HALLOWEEN; for example, the prank calls in this one are comical. But, my God, that old bore-fest is about as appealing today as a Hilary Duff movie. You see, the genius of this BLACK XMAS is that it doesn't try to recapture what made the first one, for that would be an impossible and not so practical task. Morgan instead takes the set-up of the first one and gives horror fans a nice, very-watchable Holiday treat in the tradition of SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE and Friday THE 13TH. With Bob Clark serving as executive producer, the dark humor of the first one is still present and really acts as the prime impetus for the movie's success; I mean, seriously, this movie has it all: child abuse, killer trannies, skin diseases, sex, and enough blood to fill Santa's slay...all the stuff sickos aren't seeing enough of these days in mainstream horror. And there's some great one-liners in here too. ~ We're in the age of remakes, there's no doubt about it. But, how should filmmakers go about doing these remakes? Well, there's lots of different ways to go about them. But, what the hell's the point of simply using the original and then just changing bits here and there at will, like in the 06 OMEN remake this past year? And what the hell's the point of doing a Van Sant shot-to-shot remake? I mean, who do these guys think they are? and why are they wasting their time? These questions are of course hypothetical, but it seems to me the best way to go about a remake is taking the original's premise and then re-imagining it for the purpose of entertainment - accomplished nicely here. All in all, as an avid fan of horror, this movie left me with a zesty, refreshing taste in my mouth. Although, from an objective standpoint, there's no innovation here, and, yes, this movie could quite easily be perceived as absolutely pointless. But, still, killer trannies kick ass! ~~ UPCOMING REVIEWS: 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE', 'THE ILLUSIONIST'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, despite whatever you all have read before about this film, saying that it's dreadful beyond belief, I disagree. You can take my word, too. This movie was awesome! I loved the violence, gore and the fact that it takes place on what's supposed to be the happiest day of the year, it just blew my mind. I saw the original, liked it, but liked this one better. And the fact that people compare this to the original, is pointless. I believe that a movie should be based on itself, and not the original. I think it should stand by itself and not be judged because of whatever happened 30 something years ago. I hope you all give this a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unholy night of eerie cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas is a grisly and unapologetically gruesome remake adapted from Bob Clark's original 1974 controversial Christmas slasher. This one gets right what most remakes don't. It's not without flaws, but it surely pays more careful attention the formula and smooths out some of, what looked to be, the inevitable rough edges.For one thing, the film earns its R rating which is a blessing. I'm so very, very tired of PG-13 horror films and to see a remake of a violent slasher that was R rated be stamped with an R rating further shows that they didn't want to cut out all the gore to try and market to the teen demographic. Second, Black Christmas is more concerned with establishing a creepy and uneasy setting better than any horror remake I've ever seen. The cinematography is enriching and part of the reason the film still surprises me today. The music, which was the final work composed by Shirley Walker before her death a month before the release date of the film, perfectly enhances and compliments the setting to further the eerie feeling we get diving into this film blindly.The kills are some of the goriest in any remake I've seen. There's one scene, during the murder of the family, that could go down as one of the most disturbing yet well crafted scenes in horror in the last ten or so years. Black Christmas is mean-spirited and utterly proud of it. I've never seen such a shamelessly gruesome horror remake like this. It follows up every disgusting scene with one more of equal or more quality.The storyline is actually pretty well developed as well. It centers around Billy Lenz (Mann) who was abused and hated by his mother. After witnessing his father being brutally murdered then buried by his mother and her boyfriend, now his step dad, years later Billy, whom still scared, kills both of his parents and is now in a mental institution for the criminally insane. Every year he claims he'll be home for Christmas and tries to escape, but is caught every time.Now his home is a sorority house filled with foul-mouthed, attractive young women many of which you have to listen closely to pick up on their names. The actresses are played by Michelle Trachtenberg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Crystal Lowe, Katie Cassidy, Oliver Hudson, Lacey Chabert, and Kristen Cloke. Because James Wong is producer and many of the actresses were in Final Destination and Final Destination 3, films he worked on, I can only assume Wong was a big help when it came to cast this movie.The sisters spend their night opening their gifts, drinking, subtly insulting one another, and swearing the night away. Over the course of the evening, a man persistently calls them leaving harassing and eerie messages on the receiver. You can see where this is going...There is an involving story, some great cinematography, and a very interesting backstory. But the lack of character development is sad yet expected. The film doesn't really seem to concerned about the teenagers and surprisingly, without spoiling anything, there is less people alive than one would believe at the end. Which is why I think James Wong's role in this film was huge since the gory deaths and quick murders are very reminiscent of the Final Destination franchise. Black Christmas is brutal, vile, vicious, and true to its title, but also one of the artsiest horror films I've seen in quite sometime.NOTE: The star rating is pretty much void here. This could easily be given a one or a four. Stars don't shine on a black Christmas.Starring: Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachtenberg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Oliver Hudson, Lacey Chabert, Kristen Cloke, and Andrea Martin. Directed by: Glen Morgan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake of the 1974 classic, most say it is no where near as good as the original but it's still a very entertaining movie. It does something the original didn't do which is give a backstory to Billy, it is a little far-fetched but hey, it could happen...maybe. Most of the cast is of the sorority sisters who some you want to live, others you hope don't. The lead is of Kelli or Katie Cassidy who is done fairly good. This is one of the most attractive casts in a movie I've ever seen. All of the girls are absolutely beautiful and have a real good future. It is not as scary as the original BUT it is way more entertaining. It plays more off of the Christmas feel than the first. Still, it probably could've been better but it is still very good. I'd say go buy it, it's very good. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Yule Tide Slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well What better way to celebrate Christmas than with the deaths of sorority girls...As we know with all horror movies "the horror is never over!" The movie takes place at a Sorority house where the sisters are about to take off on their Christmas break. Unfortunately an escaped mental patient wishes to be in time for his homecoming and it's the Sorority House. As would be predicted lots of death and gore ensue. Will the girls make it out alive before they become some maniac's house decorations? Can't say I was a fan of the acting or really the movie in general. I like bad horror and this is really the only reason why I would keep watching this movie over again just because I do kind of get some enjoyment of seeing the characters die in this one as I have very little emotional attachment to any of them...except for one so I can't really reveal who as it would be a spoiler. This movie is a remake of an obscure movie that I haven't seen so I have trouble comparing. Lastly the movie plays at being a psychological horror when it really is just another slasher movie. If you like a good yule tide slasher movie this is the one for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "Black Christmas," I would rate as being one of the best horror films of the 70's and best period; this remake is complete garbage and lame. There was nothing remotely scary or creepy in this film. It is like bad, over-the-top acting with a bunch of gore for the sake of having gore in their movie. Gone is the eeriness of the setting and creepy phone calls. In the original, the phone calls sound as though they were done by one person; in the remake it is obvious that they brought in the actors who played various parts from his past in to dub their voices. . . not scary! The only thing remotely interesting is going into Billy's past and showing the scenes that are still circulating through his mind that he imitates in the phone calls of both original and remake. That's it. Really we did not need to see those things in the past because it was more scary to imagine some of these scenes. I will say that at least this film had different color schemes and lighting for specific scenes and settings unlike most horror/thriller movies of today with only one throughout(and usually the one with under-exposed, high contrast with a blueish cast to the image). I was sad that this was the first film I got to see at Grauman's Chinese Theater. . . thankfully it was not in the big theater, so it wasn't entirely ruined. This movie is Exhibit A as to why they should not remake movies that are good to begin with. Remake bad ones and make them better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I actually thought that I was through with Christmas movies. I watched at least 25 last year, and it is time for a break.However, I could not resist peeking at this one. I am sorry i did because it was just a cheesy remake of Halloween 30 days later.No, I wasn't compelled to watch because of Michelle Trachtenberg, as I am not a "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" fan and have no idea who she is. Neither was I attracted to Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who I just saw in Die Hard 4, as she really did nothing to contribute to that movie. Yes, there was a lot of eye candy sitting around the sorority house, but that is all it was as there was little acting going on. Kinda like a visit to the Playboy Mansion, but they would make it worth your while. Not here.Fortunately, there will not be a Black Christmas II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ho-Ho-Ho Horror Redux of a Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BLACK Christmas (2006) **1/2 Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachtenberg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Lacey Chabert, Kristen Cloke, Andrea Martin, Crystal Lowe, Oliver Hudson, Robert Mann, Karin Konoval, Dean Friss, Jessica Harmon, Leela Savasta, Kathleen Kole, Cainan Wiebe, Christina Crivici, Howard Siegel, Peter Wilds. Ho-Ho-Ho Horror Redux of a Cult ClassicNot many recall the original 1974 cult classic horror film "Black Christmas" directed by Bob Clark ("A Christmas Story", "Porky's"), which featured Margot Kidder and Olivia Hussey, but the simple fact is "Halloween" as the first of its genre eclipsed the film as a holiday slasher film a few years later. The original is actually very scary and disturbing and the remake for the 21st century has its moments and wisely a few homages to its predecessor.Set in a snow bound Christmas Eve sorority row house with several of its inhabitants remaining and unknowing that the previous resident, a certified homicidal killer named Billy ? who killed his family 30 years ago ? has just broken out of the asylum and is making tracks for a sort of homecoming, sets the mood for this bloody good but by no means great remake with reservations.Namely the decision to give Billy a backstory. In the original the killer is never really figured out in spite of his trademark sick phone calls pranked on the nubile young women who anger him to the point of some truly nasty and twisted murders. The schizophrenic nature of the character is fleshed out to include incest and a twist that is best left unsaid, but for me I figured it out in the first few minutes of the film.Director Glen Morgan (who helmed "Final Destination") does a rather decent job with the bloodletting and heebie-jeebies, notably the use of eye imagery (the original had some trademark sequences of close-ups of the fevered maniac's eyeball peeping out of several holes) and the equally grisly come-uppances of the co-eds (who quite frankly are almost difficult to tell whose who since the majority are nubile brunettes; not necessarily a criticisms more than an annoying observation).While the chills and thrills are uneven at best the shocks come quick and deadly which is the way any genre fan will be pleased to hear. For trivia buffs Martin ? who appeared in the original as a victim ? returns this time as the mother hen to the sorority under siege.</fullReview>

Some of the things the girls did was dumb there was a house right next door they could have rant to. The acting wasn't as bad as some people were saying and each girl had different personality which made the movie more enjoyable to watch. Unlike the original this movie had more of a Christmas feel to it. The Christmas lights in the hallways gave the house a ominous feeling which i thought was good. What i didn't like was some parts from the trailer were not in the movie. The part where the girl is being dragged by Christmas lights isn't in it and i was looking forward to that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better suited for straight to video.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it has come to this. The recent horror movie boom yields it's worst spawn since House of the Dead. Black Christmas only confirms my fears that Hollywood sees horror as a way to make a quick buck, and has little investment in furthering the genre or providing the viewer with plausible scripts or adequate acting.Black Christmas is a confused jumble of violent slasher movie, a whodunit, and a teenage girl sass-fest. The set-up is inconceivable, the characters are stock, and often introduced and discarded recklessly, and the pacing is horrid. Numerous slasher clichés are stolen, and used without wit or homage. The movie story has so many holes that the viewer finally gives up trying to make sense of it all. In short, Black Christmas lacks the effort and and humor to warrant a major market release.My main beef with Black Christmas is the slapped together feeling the movie has. The script jumps around in the beginning, painfully trying to introduce characters, and loses the story setting almost immediately. The movie tries to be darkly humorous, but fails. The movie tries to titillate, but fails to deliver, even though a bevy of comely young girls are there for the exploiting. The violence is loud, but at times bashful, like there was no special effects budget to actually show the good stuff. The kills were abrupt and poorly thought out. Strictly by the numbers kill fest that would have been better sent straight to video.Hollywood has become masters at creating scary trailers for sub-par movies. We the movie going public need to rise up and demand that the actual movies deliver as well. See The Devel's Rejects if you want a good starting point. Avoid Black Christmas!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Black Christmas" done B-movie style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so, this was bad. Really bad! The movie features cheap scares, uninteresting characters, ineffective directing...and a killer with a liver decease. Especially when you compare this movie to the 1974 original, this movie is an extremely bad and disappointing one.The movie really makes a big mistake by making the movie halve set in 'present' time, while the other story is told in flashback-mode, telling Billy's back-story.But no, seriously this isn't the movie its biggest issue. Thing just is that this movie has totally no suspense, which is mostly due to the very poor directing and storytelling of the already weak and simplistic story, in which nothing comes as a surprises and everything progresses in a very formulaic and predictable manner. Glen Morgan is obviously a very inexperienced director and lets hope he'll stop directing movies like this. Also his writing is obviously lacking. He wrote the screenplay for this movie, which he loosely based on the Roy Moore 1974 screenplay of the original "Black Christmas" movie, directed by Bob Clark. I say loosely, because basically all he uses from the 1974 screenplay is the concept of having a killer killing off girls in a sorority house on Christmas eve. The story features some really poor and lame written elements, that you just don't learn in film-school.Yes, so it's still a remake of the 1974 horror movie with the same title but there are lots of differences. These differences and changes are not for the good however. In this movie we for instance already know who the killer is from the firs moment on and what his motivations are (it gets overly explained in the movie why he is so messed up and how messed up he is, by giving him a back-story) and it's also (unintentional) pretty clear on from the beginning who is the second killer of the movie, while in the remake this was all still a big mystery. The fact that this all gets revealed so early on in the movie already takes away lots of the tension and mystery of the movie. It was a big mistake to show so much of the movie its killers. On top of that the movie gave them a monstrous look, which is of course just plain ridicules.The movie its scares are very cheap as if they thought that the character's reactions to the situations would make the sequences look scary enough. For instance during the phone calls; the characters are totally panicking and looking scared by it, while it are just odd sounding phone calls that are not scary sounding but instead more like a prank call from the 9-year neighbor boy. They tried to let the movie look more 'horror' like by inserting lots of gore but really no, it doesn't work out.The movie feels just like an excuses to kill of as many characters as possible in one movie. All of the kills just feel pointless and they follow each other too fast. Basically every 15 minutes another character dies but you just stop caring about it after a while. It really doesn't make the movie exciting to watch and on top of that of course also makes it all quite predictable. You basically know who is going to die when, as the sequences get build up. It also doesn't help much that you simply can not care about any of the characters. Most of the characters are all the same and the actresses and actors are not exactly future Oscar winners either.The story is almost entirely set at one location and it cuts right to the chase, so to speak. It doesn't spend any time on proper development and the viewer gets bombarded with kills, gore and monstrous looking killers, without just caring much about any of it.And seriously what was with the musical score? What an incredibly weak and simplistic sounding horror score. A shame that this had to be composer Shirley Walker's last score. She unexpectedly died before this movie its release. Perhaps she also wasn't 100% finished and satisfied yet with the score herself but they had to use it in the movie anyway?Please, just watch the original 1974 "Black Christmas" movie instead.2/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another dreary remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems we live in a time where filmmakers would rather rip off a classic than come up with something original, and Bob Clark's 1974 classic Black Christmas is just another film to get the remake treatment - and rather unsurprisingly, not only is this film worse than the original - it's a damn awful piece of crap in it's own right. I won't profess to be a big fan of the original Black Christmas - although I like it better than Halloween and it probably would find itself high up on my list of favourite slashers...if I ever were to make one. This film would, of course, find itself propping up said list. Naturally, Black Christmas Remake takes place at Christmas time and focuses on a group of girls that live in a sorority house. However, it turns out that this particular sorority house was once home to Billy Lenz - a spree killer who murdered his mother and her lover years earlier after being mistreated. Naturally, he just happens to escape the mental asylum while the girls at still at the house, and soon they find themselves being tormented and picked off one by one by the demented killer.The first film was gritty like a slasher should be; whereas this one is all 'nice' and polished, like a slasher shouldn't be, and it really kills the atmosphere. We get introduced to eight young girls, which although played by some good looking actresses; are completely boring and very difficult to care about, which really kills the film. Black Christmas Remake is directed by Glen Morgan who previously directed the very decent remake of Willard. A director with only remakes on his resume isn't very impressive at the best of times; and much less so in this case for the fact that one of those remakes is this film! Aside from the young girls being killed, we also get 'treated' to the story of the killer, which is just as uninteresting as the rest of the film. There's a fair amount of gore, much of it quite grizzly, but again the polished look of the film makes it hard to be shocked by it. It's only short at just seventy five minutes, which is a good thing; though unfortunately, the director sees fit to pull an ill-advised twist out of his hat, which doesn't go down very well. As remakes go, this is surely one of the worst and anyone thinking of seeing it should get a copy of the 1974 film instead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dear. A slasher-horror remake, starring mediocre B-grade actors who ooze style and trendiness but lack substance. This was banal, trite and so lacking in suspense - what an insult to the original; what a pretentious pile of goats entrails; what a black day for horror.If a serial killer decides to set upon a group of characters in one location, make it suspenseful. If the group of characters have to be plastic, talentless pretty people, make them die horribly. If you want to truly impress audiences with grim death scenes, make sure you know that a 5 inch icicle dropping 3 feet can NOT penetrate a persons skull.This was a lazy remake at best, which typifies the ilk of SCREAM-type garbage that tries to cash in on younger audiences. Truly cack.Do yourself a favour: even if you own HALLOWEEN on DVD, you'd be better off buying it again rather than paying to watch this pathetic exercise.Mr Morgan and Mr Wong, I am a big fan of some of your other work. But for this, shame on you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If a movie sucks, but no one's in the theater to watch it, does it make a sound??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In yet another hopelessly clichéd sequel to a classic horror film, Black Christmas, Glen Morgan has made the first outright bomb of his career. The man worked wonders with Space: Above and Beyond, X-files and Millennium episodes, he has a few minor near-classics with Boys Next Door and the First Final Destination. Even his lesser films up until now had a few moments that made them watchable. But with this sorry little excuse for 'horror' that has a group of dull cliché sorority sisters and their den-mother being stalked by a killer and her equal demented yellow father/ brother on Christmas is just not good in any way and is a downright mockery of a classic. If you listen real closely you can hear the legendary Bob Clark spinning in his grave at this debacle. The characters are painted in such broad uncharismatic strokes that it's hard to care for any of them. The new back story is horrible. And all in all it's just an incredibly sub-par film. It didn't help matters that the Weinstein brothers clueless idiots that they are chose to release this on Christmas holiday where it quite reasonably bombed horribly bad. (Of course the brothers, never learning anything, choose to release Grindhouse the following Easter weekend with pretty much the same results) Eye Candy: Karin Konoval got topless; Crystal Lowe shows all (however the former isn't hot and you can see the latter nude in better films) My Grade: DDVD Extras (R1): 28 minute "What Have You Done?: The Remaking of Black Christmas" featurette; 26 and a half minute "May All Your Christmases Be Black" ?

		<shortDescription>Awesome bloody remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit when I first saw Black Christmas (2006) I didn't like it to well. Maybe it was because I had at the time, just seen the super creepy original that when I saw this one, not only was I disappointed, that the film lacked the creepy, scary feel of the first &amp; seemingly substituted a lot of the suspense &amp; tension of the original for out right blood &amp; guts, but also the fact that the film took a far more obvious approach in it's plot &amp; execution that I thought to myself "why bother?" however, upon recently seeing it again, it has now become one of my all time favourite slasher films! True, compared to the 1975 original it's not as good, but I now feel Black Christmas (2006) is still a pretty decent slasher film that stands well enough on it's own &amp; deserves more recognition than it has been getting since it's release. The film is certainly well acted, with each of the girls putting in a really good performance &amp; best of all they're all gorgeous too! The direction by JAMES WONG is expertly done, as he is able to conjure up a sense of mood &amp; creepiness to the proceedings. Since this is an updated for the times remake, Black Christmas (2006) also happens to have a much higher body count &amp; tends to be a lot more bloody &amp; violent, not to mention over the top in the executions of the kills, apart from the original film, who's deaths were mostly kept off screen. Here the kills are decidedly nasty &amp; all have a weird Christmas theme to them: We get a Christmas ornament to the eye, an icicle to the eye, pulled out eyeballs, a sharp candy cane to the neck, a vicious beheading, strangulation with Christmas lights, a tree decorated with human eyeballs &amp; a severed head, a vicious beating with a roller pin, flesh carved away from a body &amp; turned into Christmas cookies &amp; in an even grosser twist, a couple of the victims are cannibalized, the back of a skull is hacked off with an ice skate, we get a garden trowel to the face &amp; in a tribute to the original films most infamous kill, a victim is smothered via a plastic bag that is placed over her head, before getting a knife plunged into it to stop her from moving, ultimately though, unlike the 1975 film, it doesn't spend to much time with this corpse, as it is only seen for a couple frames in the movie &amp; the glass unicorn death scene is also done again, only extra bloody &amp; these are just some of the methods of death employed. The film also displays a few nude bodies &amp; a few sexual elements, one which disturbingly involves incest. Also grafted onto the film is a back story for the killer Billy &amp; his unseen (in the original) sister Agnes, detailing their somewhat sick &amp; twisted past. To be truthful, the film really takes very little from the original movie, who's story was set over a series of a few days leading up to Christmas eve. Black Christmas 06' story is set entirely over one night &amp; discards the father looking for his missing daughter subplot, to an extent, replacing the dad with an older sister, who has come looking for her sibling when she fails to show up. It also discards the police officer character played by JOHN SAXON in the first &amp; the subplot involving one of the girls being pregnant &amp; considering an abortion &amp; the boyfriend who may or may not be doing the killings &amp; in a nice nod to the original film, Billy escapes from the "Clark Sanitarium" which is a nod to the original films director, the late BOB CLARK &amp; ANDREA MARTIN being cast in the role of the house mother after playing one of the sorority girls in the 1975 film was a nice touch (yet somehow I can't help but feel that the film was just begging for MARGOT KIDDER to take the role &amp; have made it much more fun!) the film tends to use the holiday setting &amp; integrate it better into it's story &amp; setting, than the first one did, as there is plenty of Christmas sites &amp; themes abounding &amp; Wong &amp; company are able to deliver a nice polished &amp; sleek look to the proceedings, ditching the darker, greener, grainier look of the 75' version &amp; I felt adding a subplot surrounding the relationship between sorority girl Kelly &amp; Lea, one of the older sisters of the sorority girls, was a nice touch &amp; the film even goes in depth on the history of Christmas, during a conversation between the girls, where one of them let's the others in on the fact that Christmas originates with pagan &amp; not Christian religion.On the downside however, perhaps Black Christmas 06's greatest down fall is that it tends at times to not know when to quit. The film is really good, tight &amp; suspenseful &amp; is a lot of fun to watch for horror fans, but the film-makers seem to drop the ball in the last fifteen minutes when the film falls apart with a somewhat okay, but ludicrous ending, that felt out of place on the film &amp; the film tends to sacrifice a lot of the suspense of the first for more stylish out &amp; out gore &amp; the back story involving Billy &amp; how his sister really came to be, comes off as a little to trashy at times to the point where one could almost consider it instant sleaze.Apart from that, Black Christmas 06' is a nice edition to any slasher fans horror movie library &amp; works well enough to stand on it's own, as a nice bloody slasher gem. See it!***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God Awful! I mean BAD and I'm a lenient reviewer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film gets a special 2/10 grade from me because there is one redeeming factor in this film. The girls are very hot. There is no doubt about it that Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachtenberg, Lacey Chabert, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Crystal Lowe are incredibly gorgeous. Their looks keep you glued to the screen during this god awful remake to, one of my favorite horror films, Black Christmas. Too bad their beauty can't save the film from being by far the most awful film of 2006. Maybe I'm being bitter because I love the original so much but the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for butchering the originals good name.I'd like to point out that earlier this year director Glen Morgan talked very angrily about the When A Stranger Calls remake. He said that he had saw the film and that Black Christmas would not go down the same path as that film. He said that the film was sub-par and that Black Christmas would be much better. Well, Mr. Morgan I'm going to say that the mediocre mess known as When A Stranger Calls is hands down a much better film than your take on Black Christmas. I have to ask myself has this guy even seen the original film? Did he simply think it had a cool title and just wanted to make his own story and sell it as a remake? To fans of the original there are no similarities except that it takes place on Christmas, it involves someone named Billy, and there are sorority girls. Other than that this film is much different and definitely not in a better way.The first major mistake is providing a backstory for "Billy". The original film allowed us to imagine what might have drove Billy to the point of murdering the sorority girls. The fact that we learned very little about him or even saw what he looked like, added to the overall mystery of the character. In the 2006 version, we get so much backstory that it truly makes him a rather neutered villain. They go down the typical he went crazy and killed his family route which resulted in him being locked up in a sanitarium. Of course on Christmas Eve he breaks out and decides to stalk the sorority house which turns out to be his former home. There is no mystery and no intrigue whatsoever. It also doesn't help that the flashback scenes of Billy's childhood are so sloppily handled that they actually slip into unintentional comedy. I literally laughed out loud due to some of the absurdity of these scenes. They don't mesh well with the already horrendously bad present day story.Then there are the sorority girls. Not one of them is likable. Even the heroine is a bit annoying and she definitely doesn't have the same virtue as the Olivia Hussey character from the original film. It seems like, with the exception of Katie Cassidy and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, that everyone is running on auto bitch pilot. They are nasty, evil, and just plain superficial. If you were to ask me the difference between the Michelle Trachtenberg character and the Lacey Chabert character, I really couldn't tell you. For some reason the screenwriter wanted all the female characters to be exactly alike which gives the audience no one to root for. In fact, I couldn't wait for most of them to meet their demise.The film is also excessively gory. Some might call this a blessing but in the case of this film, it is a major roadblock. The original film had little to no blood in it but of course in today's horror movie market you have to gross out the audience, so Black Christmas does just that. The problem is the violence isn't visceral, it appears to be purely comical. I didn't turn away once out of fright but I certainly laughed at how ridiculous the violence was. I shouldn't be laughing at a killer eating human eye balls but Black Christmas makes you do just that. The film leaves very little to the imagination and positively kills one of the best aspects of the original film.The acting is a non-issue. No one here is any good. I've seen many of these actresses do very well in other projects but Black Christmas should be removed from their resumes if they hope to gain respect in the industry. They are all beautiful girls (I for one am surprised by how grown up Michelle Trachtenberg and Lacey Chabert look in the film) but beauty can only get you so far. They all scream well but the script and the film does nothing for them. They all leave the film looking a little embarrassed with themselves.The only thing I hope this film does is allow audiences to discover the original film. I implore you people discover the 1974 classic and please ignore the 2006 remake. It is a disgrace and I hope it dies a quick death never to be heard from again. Do yourself a favor and avoid this trainwreck at all cost but feel free to buy the new special edition of the original film which is currently found in stores. This new version is definitely one to miss unless you need a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashback, Flashback, Flashbacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with this movie is that it starts too far into the story it is trying to tell. Unlike a movie like Halloween where one event in the past defines the evil, this movie has repeated flashbacks. The flashbacks get annoying because they interrupt the current story being told. In most regards, this movie is like any other slasher movie. Crazy lunatic stalks helpless victims. The Christmas theme doesn't really help the story. There is a slight twist towards the end of this movie if compared to other slasher movies, but it's not really setup well. The movie has to use flashbacks to keep the story going forward, so the flashback spoil the fun of guessing which way the story will go.This is a movie you can skip completely unless you just love slasher movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw this film just after Christmas and im glad i did. if i saw it before i would have never gotten to sleep on Christmas eve. the film stars people such as 'andrea martin' (black Christmas 1974) 'lacey chabert' (mean girls) and 'mary elizebeth winstead' (final destination 3). the film starts in the house of 9 sorority sisters and their teacher. the girls are just about to open their Christmas presents when one gets murdered. the rest of the girls assume she has gone home for the holidays. a movement in the Attic gets the attention of another one of the girls, as she heads up, she too is murdered. the remaining girls begin to get strange phone calls. one of the murdered girls sisters goes round to the house, looking for her. the girls and their teacher begin to get murdered one by one until only one sorority sister and the murdered girls sister remain. as they head up into the Attic in search of survivors, billy (the murderer) and his inbred sister/daughter appear for an amazing climax. through-out the film we see what happened in the house during the 1980s and 1990s and it shows why billy resorted to murder. the film is very jumpy through-out and can be very scary at times. i give this film a great 10/10 and would recommend it to anyone. :) :D</fullReview>

Its a really good movie although the ended could have been better than it was.It wasn't the best horror film made, but it will get you your money's worth.

		<shortDescription>BEYOND Implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even as far as "just fun" horror movies go, this movie was BEYOND implausible. There are some movies you cannot remake in today's world of technology/information, and this is one of them.Here's a list of the extremely implausible moments that make this movie unbearable.1. They don't call the cops after multiple girls are missing (cars/stuff still at house but girls are nowhere to be found) and they receive 2 threatening phone calls from separate missing girls' phones that freak ALL of them out.2. BOTH killers escape(him)/get released(her) from separate nut-houses without talking to each other at the same time, decide to go on a killing rampage, on the same night, in the same house. Even though he killed a couple people during his escape, the cops don't seem to know/care that he escaped (see below). And WHO LET HER OUT of her insane asylum?! She's a 1-eyed incest baby who watched her brother(father) kill her parents! How was she seen as "fit for society"? 3. These murders are VERY gory, yet when they enter room where the 1st girl was killed, there's no blood on the carpet, bed, etc. Sure, she took the body for her "doll collection" but what about the blood. Not only is she a killer, she's a SUPER MAID! 4. After they find one of their roommate's severed heads, they finally decide to call the police and explain "1 girl's been murdered, 3 girls are missing, and the killer is still at the house." What do the cops say? "We can't send someone out to you for at least 2 hours because there's a pile up on I-95." WHAT?! ARE YOU KIDDING?! That is the most UNBELIEVABLE response to "people are being murdered at my house RIGHT NOW and the MURDERER IS STILL HERE!" 5. After the 2 Killers are supposedly "burned" to death, they are sent to the morgue with the other dead bodies to be identified. Um, then the killers wake up at the morgue and continue their killing rampage. WHAT?! First, they're not burned at ALL, so how did they supposedly die again? Second, WHO PRONOUNCED THEM DEAD AND PUT THEM IN A BODY BAG?! OBVIOUSLY, they didn't check for a pulse or ANY vital signs because if they did the would have realized that they were, you know, ALIVE.I love horror films...even ones that have holes in the plot. However, this was just obnoxious. I gave it a 2 out of 10 for gore factor alone...other than that, this movie was HORRIBLE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be called "The People in the Walls"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since this is a remake you can't help comparing it to the original. Black Christmas (1974) was a first-rate horror thriller that paved the way for horror films to come. It's been imitated a lot over the years so maybe it was inevitable that a remake would surface. While the original is best known for it's tremendously scary atmosphere and gruelling tension this remake goes in another direction entirely. It's brutal, gory and very fast paced. None of it good, by the way.In the original viewers were left to fill in the blanks concerning Billy. What were his motives? What was his background? Who the hell was Agnes? And more. Here everything is explained away and I don't think I'm the only one who considers this script not even worthy of wiping somebody's ass. I won't spoil anything but here you'll find out Billy's reasons for his homicidal spree and you also get the lowdown on Agnes.If we leave the technical aspects of this film aside, there's one thing severely lacking here: TALENT. The director is also credited for the script so we can put most of the blame on him. There's no tension to be found, any attempt at creating a creepy atmosphere is laughable and the characters are not only annoying but very badly acted. But to their credit, their roles were beyond bad anyway.The film just jumps from one kill to the next and a great effort is put into making things very gross (such as Billy's eating preference etc.). It's O.K. to make the kills somewhat brutal, but that seems to be the only thing that's accomplished with any skill. The dialogue here is horrible and I guess the director thought it was hip and cool to have everybody hating Christmas and poor old Santa takes a beating this time around, being called a perv and also of course he's referred to as Santa "f******" Claus. The whole script looks like it was written by a teenager.As said, the kills are brutal and not completely without imagination but that simply doesn't count for much when the film is devoid of suspense and no tension at all. It's very predictable as well. Overall I'd say it's offensive to remake a classic horror film in this way. One can only wonder as to how bad a script has to be to get the axe.The two stars go to the technical department who have done a good job. The lighting schemes are on occasion great and the kills are done in a splendid way.Final verdict: Very bad film and not even of interest to genre fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Makes this a remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to remakes, there are two types of directions one can take.The first, a scene for scene remake, has become redundant. Psycho didn't work as a remake.The second can sometimes work: in my opinion it worked quite well for the 2006 remake of The Hills Have Eyes." Black Christmas finds itself decidedly in this second category.For those who are interested, the original film was about a disturbed and unknown killer who stalks the girls of a sorority and one by one picks them off, making an obligatory and frightening phone call in the short time after their death.In the remake, the spirit of this is there: the phone calls usually (but not always) come after a murder, there is a disturbed pair (no one killer here) stalking the girls, and...well, that is where the similarities end. Unless you count Andrea Martin being in both of them (an ironic twist for those of us who remember how sweet, pragmatic and young she was when the original was made), or the first victim being named "Clair." This film is a mess. Unlike the original, where Billy was a personality on the phone who seemed to have a malevolence...and was only exposed as the killer at the end, we know that "Billy" is the killer all through this film. We know Billy's story- this in itself works against the film because a lot of the mystery of the original came from the possibility that one of the guys (most likely Peter, in the original) was capable of resembling a normal guy on the outside, but being so vicious and demented on the inside that he was capable of vicious acts of evil.Billy was born with yellow skin, and was loved by his father and hated by his mother. One Christmas as a young boy he finds a present to him from "Santa," hears his parents arguing, and ventures downstairs to witness his father viciously murdered by his mother and her companion in adultery. It is at this point that Billy is locked in the attic.Over the next few years, Billy is "blessed" with a new sister/daughter (this has to be seen to be believed), kills his mother and stepfather, and eats the eyeball (a recurring theme in this movie) of his daughter/sister before he munches down some Christmas cookies made from the flesh of his dead mother.He's institutionalized, hatches a plan to escape, and reunites with his daughter/sister who has become as demented as he is, and who has started to murder the girls at the sorority.This film doesn't excel in any area: its not smart enough to be effective, not gory enough to be disgusting, and not well acted enough to be effective. Among some of the most obvious gaffes...before she dies, Clair starts a card for her sister's gift with "Leigh," - however when Leigh in fact finds the gift, it reads "To my big sister Leigh; from your baby sister Clair." I think the biggest load of all however is the pair of killers. Billy isn't so much a problem...but his sister/daughter is so obviously a man that all throughout the film, I couldn't help but think of the WWE wrestler Kane in a blonde wig... I wonder where he was when this film was being shot??? The film does have some very minor bright spots: Andrea Martin's presence in it; a rather post modernist interpretation of Christmas and so on...however this film really has nothing worth watching! Its really disappointing that in a film that was so effective in 1974 that its still scary in 2006, they had to remake such a film into THIS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite great potential, ultimately just another inferior remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have mixed feelings about this remake. It had all the potential to be a good, solid, suspenseful horror/thriller, but director Glen Morgan apparently decided that instead of trying to scare the audience, it would be far easier and simpler to gross them out. As a lifelong horror/slasher movie fan, I don't consider myself squeamish, and I've happily sat through gorier films than this, but there are some surprisingly gruesome scenes. I'm amazed that Black Christmas 2006 only received a 15 certificate here in the UK - what does a film have to do to get an 18 these days? The most depressing thing about the gore in this film is that it's so calculated. As I've stated above, Morgan has just gone straight for the audience's stomachs, rather than their nerve endings (it reminded me of all those slasher movies that followed in Halloween's wake in the early Eighties, made by directors who lacked John Carpenter's talent, so they threw blood and guts at the camera to compensate). Presumably Morgan, the producers, and/or the studio felt that recent films such as Hostal and the Saw series have raised the bar regarding cinematic bloodletting, and they had to do the same to compete.The phone calls that were such a key element of the original Black Christmas are still included in this remake, but there're not an important part of the story. I suspect they've been de-emphasised to avoid comparisons with the When A Stranger Calls remake that was released earlier in 2006 (which is ironic, seeing as how the original When A Stranger Calls - released in 1979 - owed a clear debt to the original Black Christmas - released in 1974). Instead, a new element is introduced: a series of flashbacks that reveal the Jerry-Springer-on-acid life story of the film's psycho villain, but these are mostly unnecessary, add nothing to the narrative other than slow it down, and don't succeed in making the killer a more interesting or threatening figure. Their inclusion appears to be solely to add to the yuck factor. It would have been more effective to simply have the killer's history revealed in a monologue delivered by another character.Yet another disappointment is the fact that having gathered together a great, once-in-a lifetime cast of up-and-coming young starlets, the script gives them so little to do, other than react to events. Most of the characters are barely two-dimensional and completely interchangeable, and if you wanted to be cynical, you could suspect that the main reason the producers cast so many familiar faces was simply to help the audience tell the characters apart.Some of the other casting decisions are bizarre. A character who appears in a '15 years ago' flashback is played by the same actor in present-day scenes, but no attempt seems to have been made to make him look as though he's aged at all. The grown-up child of another character is played by someone who actually looks older than the actor portraying the parent! And if that wasn't enough, one key character is played by an actor of the opposite gender - and it shows.Ultimately what little goodwill the movie does generate is mostly ruined by the rushed, clichéd and logic-free ending. Although much inferior to the classic original, Black Christmas 2006 isn't truly a bad film - if it was, I would easily dismiss it as such. Instead it's that perhaps even more frustrating animal, a movie that had all the necessary ingredients and could have been really good - but fell short and ended up as merely being adequate.But what do I know? The audience I saw the film with (the majority of whom were younger than me) all screamed, giggled, gasped and yelled "eeow!" at the appropriate moments. I suspect most of them were texting their mates about the movie as they left the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Slasher!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is probably the best horror film I've seen in the past two years and the best slasher film (for me anyway) since I Know What You Did Last Summer. Now don't get me wrong, plot holes and character stupidity are all present throughout the film but the film succeeds in one major aspect that so many other horror films fail miserably at: its characters.Every single one of the characters I cared about. When each met their demise, I was truly sad except one of the characters who was pretty creepy and suspicious for the two minutes they were actually in. But getting back to the point, this was the film's major redeeming factor along with the death scenes (which are over-the-top and gory).Knowing that each character wasn't really based on a stereotype made me forgive their stupid mistakes (like going out alone to turn the power back on, etc). For the most part, this slasher film is a fun 'slay' ride. It doesn't hold a candle to the original for the fans but even though I liked the first one, the remake is the movie I'd prefer to watch. While the first one was great, it did get a little slow in the middle.One major disappointment I do need to point out though is that Billy was not creepy enough. He seemed a looked a little too normal to be as frightening as Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers.Anyway, this is one of the few horror remakes that is actually decent (another good remake of recent times is House of Wax). I'd recommend this film to slasher/horror movie fans but if you don't like the genre, this isn't going to change your views on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>College girls are being slaughtered by a serial killer named Billy(Robert Mann)and his "sister" Agnes(Dean Friss)on Christmas Eve. We see flashbacks to when Billy was growing up using snippets of certain years at Christmas. We see his mistreatment from his mother who, along with her lover, kills Billy's father in the same method he adopts..a black garbage bag as the suffocating weapon with some sort of sharp object to finish each victim off(his father was killed by a hammer). Agnes was born through Billy and his mother. Billy, borrowing what he learned from step-dad and mother, kills his parents viciously(..as a result Billy winds up in an asylum..after jabbing his "sister" in the eye, Agnes will be sent away, but vanishes). In the opening of present day Christmas time Clair(Leela Savasta)is murdered by someone who appears from under her bed via garbage bag and pen. Clair's sister Leigh(Kristen Cloke)is supposed to meet up with her and winds up at the sorority house wondering why the rendezvous never occurred. We see Billy escape the mental asylum/prison by fooling a numb skull guard eliminating him oh so easily(one of many hilariously ill-fated antics by the screenplay writer and director Glen Morgan). Billy, as a sick joke tossed in, has a yellow pigmentation. The film is an endlessly mean-spirited gore-fest where each member of the sorority is destroyed in gruesome fashion.Like THE FOG remake, this film takes it upon itself to over-explain everything about Billy leaving absolutely no mystery which made Bob Clark's original so haunting and fascinating. Billy and Agnes is simply a joke leaving absolutely zero suspense..just various bloodshed with sharp tools. Lots of blood spraying and the crackling of the killing tool as it penetrates the flesh with ferocity. The flick has a nasty, vile, mean-spirited attitude leaving little glimmer of hope regarding entertainment value. To be bluntly honest, this stinker is about as entertaining as the pulling of teeth from the roots. It's a moronic, by-the-numbers exercise which insults the original. The females that populate this flick all seem to follow the mold of Margot Kidder's chick in Clark's original. The problem with that is Kidder's novelty was that she was the only female of said film who spoke bluntly and rudely so it was funny. When you have an entire cast of these types, it gets annoying fast. And, the ending(..oh boy, that ending..ugh)takes the cake. Truly awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May not be JUST as good as the original, but definitely good enough!Like the original, it does have somewhat a creepy essence to it, but it wont exactly give you nightmares. The Violence/Gore is enough to deffinatley gross you out. The acting and storyline were definitely good. The characters are slightly cliché'ed but not so much that it makes you sick. You got the average nice girl(Katie Cassidy), the skeptic sarcastic girl(Crystal Lowe), the best friend(Michelle Trachtenberg), the "rich bitch"(Lacey Chabert), and the tough sister in-law(Kristen Cloke). The Death scenes are mostly original (and disturbing at times). It definitely has some good humor and a lot of character.The movie may not be perfect like the original, but for a remake, it definitely has more pros than cons! But please, judge the movie as its own movie, and don't compare it to the original. So sit back, relax, and have a Merry Black Christmas!8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of horror films, I've seen all the major big boys and had seen them dozens of times that I knew em by heart. As I expanded my tastes I happened on black Christmas.For a Christmas film it was violent, bloody and had sexual scenes making it a classic for me right away.I hadn't seen the original or knew it existed at the time and thought it was a hack and slash thriller. The lights, decorations and Santa suit all make for an enchanting look that swallows you whole. It really feels like Christmas and gave it much needed atmosphere that will either make or break a horror movie.Characterization was wonderful. At first all the girls are protested as being snobbish yet as it goes on you see hints of their true selves. I even felt pity or outrage for one character named Leigh and her sister Clair. It was very sweet and heart breaking.The death scenes were different from the ones shown in the trailer and yet it was very throughout and I noticed a common theme the killer went for in each dealing with a body part that I won't spoil for you. You'll see a few familiar faces from other genre's up in us on This chilling expedition.My own complaint is Billy's backstory. I read the original script that omitted it completely leaving us shrouded in mystery. The way it should be.Its a fun popcorn flick to share with friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas (2006): Dir: Glen Morgan / Cast: Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachtenberg, Lacey Chabert, Andrea Martin, Mary Elizabeth Winstead: Disgusting piece of trash about the invasion of evil within the beautiful. Plot is summed up with several airhead young females trapped in a big house that once homed an institutionalized murderer who was locked in an attic by his mother yet retaliated with murder. Typical slasher film structure with victims inviting their own death through stupidity. Cookie cutters are used on victims as well as sharp end candy canes and icicles. Directed by Glen Morgan who goes for the same appeal that he used with his remake of Willard, but despite the creepy atmosphere of the house he fails to make sense of it. Absolutely nobody in the cast is given anything above the standard buffoon idiot. Katie Cassidy was also guilty of taking part in that when a Stranger Calls rehash. Michelle Trachtenberg was in Harriet the Spy ten years ago and has dropped so far since. Lacey Chabert was in Mean Girls and again, she has fallen since. Andrea Martin was the unlucky one recruited from the original film and probably envies the rest of the cast who went into hiding upon hearing that this was being made. Why a family holiday is reduced to this is something that only a grim mind can answer. This is a pointless piece of crap that should be torched over a campfire. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sadly lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cast list sounds good. Katie Cassidy is very much in demand with me, what with TAKEN, MELROSE PLACE and MONTE CARLO. Michelle Trachtenberg is the darling Dawn from quintessential favorite BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, so this one I had to see. I knew that being a horror movie, it was going to get gory, but OK, I got myself the DVD.Big mistake.Let me count the ways.(1) While Katie Cassidy's character Kelli takes a while to get going (it seemed like a lost cause during the first half), Mary Elizabeth Winstead, the surprise of this movie, is underemployed. Michelle Trachtenberg peaked as Dawn, and in ICE PRINCESS, and just like Lacey PARTY OF FIVE Chabert should never have grown up. (2) It is overpopulated with a cast of what seems like thousands popping up out of the woodwork. They do, however, only exist to be killed off. (3) As characters are killed off right, left, front and center, who the freaking hell cares about them? There is no audience* involvement as we couldn't care less about these characters existing solely to be killed off.(*I am not repeat NOT talking about the kind of "audience" that finds a pornographic thrill out of spattering gore - you guys are lower than dogs and shouldn't have children) (4) This movie is not scary. It only manages to be offensive. It is poorly executed in its way over the top super-violent approach. (5) It is dumb. Well, d-uh! It is for a dumb market, but really, it is dumb, playing only to the type who can slap their knees and go chortle-chortle fit to wet themselves as a young girl gets her eyes poked out.I am not against showing a terrorized little bunny cowering in a corner as some dark hideous force bears down upon her. As a writer of several stories, sort of like movies in my mind, I would delve into psychological horror and the stuff I would have running amok on the screen would scare you lot silly. It would offend a great many of you. But it wouldn't be such an abattoir, and my heroine is somebody who is an absolute joy to behold, and she's somebody to root for as she scrambles for a way out. Granted, I cannot share this with IMDb, that is my tragedy stuck out in a dead part of the world, but these Hollywood people are in a position to produce better quality work AND YET THEY FOCUS ON SUCH MINDLESS DRIVEL as this heartless remake reveling in what I find disgusting in an offensive way.To me, a horror movie should evoke the response of wanting to grab the pretty heroine and shield her from that unspeakable evil. Yeah, old school, I suppose, but a better school, I proudly insist. You lot revel in the delight of seeing her carved up. My score of 1 -10* especially reflects that with what they had here, something much better could have been made. I fully understand that there are lots of people out there who are quite happy with this kind of stuff. Which is why the world is in such a sad and sorry state. *in the interest of being fair, I've upped it to 3 - 10A life really isn't worth two cents to you if this is your guilty pleasure. Think about that. Your poor children...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a running eyeball motif throughout this revamp/reimaging of Bob Clark's much revered culter of the same name (1974), after sitting through it you may, like me, feel like extracting your own eyeballs and playing ping-pong with them! Bunch of pretty sorority girls get menaced and mangled by a deranged killer who has come home for Christmas...This lacks everything that made Bob Clark's film so effective. The less is more approach has gone, thus there is very little suspense, and in place is a gigantic back story for the killer. The characterisation of the girls, some acted by some very capable actresses, is practically non existent, so very little emotional heft to draw you into a state of caring for them. There's some good gore on show, but since tonally the pic is all over the place, it's never once scary or ironically funny.A poor show all round. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some actress who didn't even deserve any lines gets whacked in her room at her sorority house. Meanwhile, the jaundiced lunatic who used to live in said house escapes the loony bin because people who work in those places were educated at community colleges instead of real schools.Back at the house, the girl who plays NOT-Tina Gray from the Nightmare on Elm Street remake and her douchey-looking boyfriend talk about things no one cares about before NotTina heads inside. Throughout the exposition we're introduced to Dana, played by Gretchen Wiener, the house-biotch Lauren, Megan(holy crap, this is a sorority girl? she looks 40!), Heather, played by Wendy from Final Destination 3(I guess she had what she gets in this film coming then, huh), some weirdo Eve, Harriet-the-Spy, and house mother Ms. Mac, whom I'm going to refer to as Aunt Voula from because Phyllis already died in the original. And this film has nothing if not continuity. Megan, the 40-year-old, gets interrupted by watching porn of herself(probably checking which part of her body needs to be surgically-enhanced next) and goes to investigate the attic where she discovers victim number 1 from the opening scene, and also gets whacked. I should probably make note that the killer's preferred method of murdering these trashy chicks is to be a trash bag over their head and gouge/stab out their eye/s. I'd make a joke about putting trash-in-trash bag, but I think it speaks for itself.Downstairs, our Sorority Sisters start receiving phone calls from Billy the Killer harassing them and getting all "F*** Santa." No one cares.Oh and then Miss Lewton from Final Destination shows up looking for the mute who has been murdered, claiming to be her sister. Dana thinks Miss Lewton's coat is SO. FETCH. But that's not til after we're treated to flashbacks shot by someone inspired by Quentin Tarantino and Tim Burton who just happens to lack the talent. I'm not talking about the flashbacks after this because this film could've done without. Honestly, I had enough to laugh at already.NotTina's skeezy boyfriend shows up at some point and NotTina discovers the house slut's sex tape was with the bastard. Apparently it's bad enough that he had sex with anyone before they got together, but in an age of Paris Hiltons and Kim Karsluttians, he filmed it for funsies and it leaked. NotTina is starting to come across as a frigid hypocrite. I hope she dies. Heather investigates Eve's room after she supposedly leaves and instead of death getting her by dropping a damn shelf on her head or something, she discovers damning evidence in her closet. It was at this point that I asked my boyfriend "Why didn't she turn on a light?" And he told me the power went out. I was probably checking Instagram while that happened and didn't notice. Anywho, Harriet-the-Spy has been taking care of the house bitch Lauren as she becomes the house drunk Lauren and tells her to hop in the shower so the straight males of the audience can see some side-boob as Billy spies through a hole. House Bitch/Drunk Lauren goes to bed. I really wish Harriet-the-Spy was our main character. It would've been much better than NotTina and her ice-cold vagina anyway.Then the body count starts mounting fairly quickly. Dana was trying to make Snark happen while she investigated strange noises underneath the house and Billy decides to take Regina's cattiness to the next level and gets her in the head with a gardening tool. Another threatening phone call sends the girls outside to check on Dana where they instead discover Eve decapitated in her car.After some of the most successful calls for help in a slasher film, Aunt Voula and Heather/Wendy bitch their way out through the storm to the car. While Aunt Voula is scraping ice off the windshield, Heather/Wendy finally dies after surviving Final Destination 3. You might think Billy killed her, but I like to pretend a frozen pipe inside the car cracked and the anti-freeze caused a reaction that propelled the vent to shoot out of the fan and lodge itself in Heather/Wendy's carotid artery. Aunt Voula backs her stupid self into a garage door and gets impaled with an icicle. That's cute.Harriet-the-Spy forgets the sleuthing skills she has in the mid-90s and nearly gets garbage bagged by Billy. She does manage to get away, but when she decides she should just whack him with a ski pole a few times instead of STABBING HIM WITH THE SHARP END, it becomes clear that however awesome she is, she's not going to survive. And thus our favorite character gets an ice skate to the back of the head.Sleeping house bitch/drunk then gets molested and stabbed in the eyes.So we're left with NotTina and Miss Lewton running into the douche- boyfriend and make their way to the attic where Agnes, Billy's sister-daughter, kills the boyfriend while the other 2 discover all of the corpses..Miss Lewton falls through a hole in the floor while NotTina gets pulled in between the walls. Miss Lewton finds NotTina and pulls her through the wall before setting fire to Agnes and Billy. Anyway.At the hospital, Miss Lewton opens the mute's present, the ugliest effing watch I've ever seen, before a nurse comes to inform NotTina that the doctor's want to run another X-Ray now. What? NotTina slid between walls. Miss Lewton's the one who fell a WHOLE FLOOR AND GOT KNOCKED OUT. The people working at this hospital must've gone to the same community college as the people who work at the loony bin.Billy and Agnes then come snap Miss Lewton's neck. NotTina returns, electrocutes Agnes, and then is chased down the hospital halls by Billy before getting him impaled on a tree. Fabulous.5 stars out of 10.MERRY Christmas!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah I know Christmas is over judging by the date of this review, but let's end the jolly good season with this peace of dump that Santa left under the Christmas Tree.The story is about a young boy, was abused by his mother as a child. His mother cheated on Billy's father, and eventually killed the man, while keeping Billy in the attic--for good, while she was with her lover and starting a "new" family. As Billy's mother fell pregnant with a daughter and treated her with the love he had never experienced, Billy came out of the attic after years and brutally murdered his mother and her lover. Cut to present day, a group of six sorority sisters consisting of Kelli, Dana, Lauren, Megan, Heather, Melissa and their house mother, who now live in Billy's childhood home, find themselves being harassed by threatening and intimidating mystery phone calls during Christmas Break.Originally I was going to review this movie back in December before Christmas time, but I thought nah, Christmas time is where families coming together and letting the joy of Christmas lifted everybody's spirits and I'm here talking about a crappy movie like Black Christmas which doesn't deserve a full review at Christmas time.Hollywood remakes of horror films always feels like the producer's and even the director don't even give a damn if the movie is good or not, they only want money and nothing else. And that's why I can't stand those things. Movies are art and not a cliché cash grab, and this movie is a stains of all of that.The directing sucks, the music is awful, the acting was pretty poor and this movie has to be the most cliché, bloated, over wheeling horror flick in the road of 2000's horror cliché of pure madness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is more about the story of the killer. In the brilliant original we don't know who the guy is. All we know is he kills. In this remake (which is great if you want to see pretty girls get killed) there is no story. Half the sorority girls are obnoxious and other than two, the girls are just there to add to the body count. It is a fun slasher film, if that's all you care about; if you are looking for a real story avoid this. I recommend watching the original that has a lovely cast, a real story and great acting. The remake does zero justice to the original and takes the heart of that film and crushes it. This failure is in the script.

Yet, I could not help but enjoy the 'flashback' scenes especially and their style, and I still couldn't hep but be entertained. Oh yeah, I can definitely tell the difference in quality of a horror like this and then a horror like REC or Black Swan, BUT I feel that there is still fun to be had with even the trashiest, most clichéd horrors like this. Calll me biased, but I still enjoyed this. One thing that never was horrible was the acting, which was pretty solid, and makes for even more fun when the actors are given some really terrible lines.

		<fullReview>The Black Chiristmas 2006 remake is a disappointing disgrace to Bob Clark's Classic Original Slasher. I don't mind remakes though this one was just awful. It wasn't scary or creepy and it doesn't have any originality what so ever. There is far to much gore and some scenes are really pointless. It's also a disappointment as in the year 2006 we get a really disturbing and suspenseful remake the Hills Have Eyes and then many months later in the same year we get this.The only two things I enjoyed about the film was Billy killing the security guard and Sanata brutally. I also didn't mind his half decent disturbing back story. Overall the rest of the film was crap.The film tells the same story about a Deranged Psycho who sneaks into a house in the attic. The house used to be his and now a bunch of girls are living in it which is now a sorority. In the original, the story was at a slow, smooth chilling pace while as the Remake is at a Brutal, gory, un-scary, and wrong pace. In the remake they just take things over the top, too far and to quickly.The famous bag over the head scene was well-done in the Original and in the remake they bring that scene of a scenery back to this gory waste which is just continuous for complexity. Instead of a straight forward bag death, they try to intensify it by stabbing of the eyes and then eating of the eyeballs. Some of the eyeballs are even stuck on a Christmas tree, what the hell.I suggest you ignore this remake as this film has no taste at all though I have to give the guy and young boy Billy who didn't do such a bad job. Just stay away from this remake, watch it but don't buy it. 4.7/10</fullReview>

Correction, there's NO suspense, no action. Just a series of murders happening every 5 minutes. Let's not talk about the dialogs, that was lame too. BUT I still enjoyed this movie. The actresses did a good job, especially Michelle Trachtenberg and Kristen Cloke. The ''twist'' at the end was very lame, I was expecting this movie to be scary, suspenseful, and to give TRUE homages to the original. The deaths in the movie were mostly like, identical. Bref this movie was not as great as I expected, but we had to await that from the gore masters, Glen Morgan and James Wong, of course.</fullReview>

The plot is weak and goes by too quickly. You don't even have time to like the characters before they get killed. The suspense is not edge-of-your-seat. It's just plain predictable and boring. There are some characters that you may like, such as Kelli, and (maybe) Heather. The nice girls of the house. But there are some girls that are just downright annoying, such as Lauren and Dana.

The only complaint I have, and I'm sure others feel the same, is that there is WAY too many eyeballs in this movie. Everyone is getting their eyeballs pulled out, and when their not, the camera focuses on an eyeball, it got a little ridiculous. Other than that, I loved it. The music was good as well.

		<fullReview>comparing this remake to the 1974 slasher classic is like comparing jessica alba to rosanne.this stupid remake wasn't the least bit scary at all.the original is a scary well made slasher that totally blows away the movie that gets credit for being one of the first slasher movies.of course i'm talking about the way overrated halloween.if you want some graphic gore then you can't go wrong with the remake as it does have some good gory kills.the only reason it gets a 5 out of 10 is because of the gore.the killer whose name is billy was so scary in the original.in this one he's not scary at all.how could a short geek in red pajamas be scary.one more thing these bimbos in the remake aren't near as hot looking as the lovely olivia hussey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas (2006) 2/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The travesty that is the Black Christmas remake is beyond mind-numbingly bad that it was painful to watch. There is a lot of stupidity shown by the characters with no development to them whatsoever. The plot is extremely predictable and just doesn't cut it to what the horror genre needs. Death scenes tried to be grotesque but it was a lot of splatter off scene techniques that required no creativity or decent special effects. The actresses in this movie had potential but the writing and directing was so dumbed down that didn't have a chance in putting forth reasonable roles that could be expected. I hated the back-story, the character's decision making, the kills, the script, the phone ring-tones (we get it, its Christmas), and especially the hospital scenes at the end. It's nearly the exact opposite of Clark's original masterpiece and is definitely a one and done view for a fan or horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christmas crud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of reviewers seem to hate this film because it is a remake of the 1979 film Black Christmas. I can't argue, the 1979 one was better, but mainly because the amount of vulgar language, sex talk, bad acting and awful soundtrack made it one hell of a horrible experience.But the 1979 one had vulgar language too, you say? While, yes, but it was in moderation and was used by characters to show their low-class, immature personality. In the 2006 version, the bad language and sex stuff seems to only be there to appeal to perverts and idiots who think crude humor is funny.The acting was awful, and the soundtrack was that 21st century crud. The only advice I can give is to avoid this movie at all costs, stick with the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christmas Slasher Remake? Bah Humbug!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually Christmas is a time of happiness, family, presents, Christmas trees, lights, decorations, and any and all other Christmas cheer. But for some people, Christmas time is merely another way to think up a plot to another slasher film, like this trainwreck of a movie, 2006's version of "Black Christmas". Before I go any further, let me say that I have seen the original 1974 version of "Black Christmas" and while I can't say it was the greatest horror film I ever saw, at least it was better than this. This "update" follows the same basic plot of the original, in which a group of sorority girls were being stalked and killed one by one in their creepy sorority house by a mysterious, unseen killer. But the "update", in an attempt to be different from the original, fails to incorporate the things that made the original decent. Firstly, they reveal the identity of the killer almost right from the beginning as a disturbed man named Billy who grew up and was abused by his mother in the house that now houses the sorority. For whatever reason, the writers here decide to have Billy diagnosed with liver disease, which causes his skin to turn a comical bright yellow. Now it is true that people who have liver disease can indeed have yellow skin; however, it's a slight tint of yellow. Here, the skin of the character is so bright yellow that he looks like a live character from "The Simpsons"!In Bob Clark's '74 version, we never knew who the killer was since we only saw thing from his point of view or if we were lucky his shadow and occasional eyeball, thus making the film all the more spooky. But here, not only do they reveal the killer, they also feel the need to throw in an unnecessary back story involving incest and cannibalism that was probably intended to shock but instead merely disgusts. As for the victims, due to the lack of character development they come across as no more than cannon fodder so the producers can skip setting up mood and atmosphere and get right to the gore. The characters are so bland and interchangeable that we don't even know half their names or even care whether they live or die. At least in the '74 version, we kind of cared and felt for the ladies in distress. The writing is so devoid of logic that I can't even write too many examples without laughing hysterically. I'll just say this: if you're in a dark house and several of your friends go missing and you start receiving creepy messages sent by their phones, would you stay in that house???!!! Oh and as for the big twist that the producers promised in the DVD extra, it's so flat and unimpressive that it really makes no difference to the overall film. The result of all this is a pointless film that lacks tension, spookiness, and good storytelling. So to sum it all up, if you are someone who feels the need to spend Christmas watching young woman being stalked and murdered by a sadistic killer (hey, it's the holiday season!) then at the very least, I recommend that you stick to the original Bob Clark version. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, if one can say that at the end of this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is stupid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plain and simple, all the things I hate to see in a "horror" movie, bad acting, terrible jump-scares, annoying and cliché build up music used over and over, so unrealistic, for example, if a person is on top of you wrestling you to keep you down, if you stab them in the chest, I'm not a doctor but I'm pretty sure they won't do an actual forward roll across the room. The acting - as I said is bad, the constant "NOOOO!" in every single "fight scene", and in some parts it's as if they don't give a damn about what has happened, your sister(s) have died and you crack a cringe-worthy little joke while you are struggling to survive? Cliché - oh no, I think there might be a killer in house, better make sure the power goes out and there is a significant problem which results in the police not being able to reach us! Yeah, a lot of stuff like that. There are many girls in this movie? Better make their tits visible in every scene! Jump-scares - same sense as the build up, it's so over- used (and not in this movie alone), that whole music starts out quiet, gets louder and louder, then suddenly stops, a character turns around or something then boom, an attempt to scare you... it would be so much better without the buildup and it was just a simple scare (if you don't know what a jump- scares is, it's basically a loud noise along with what you see on- screen). Unrealistic - there is way too much blood off of such little incidents, I've never ate a human eyeball before but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't crunch, the cop at the start - I highly doubt you would just walk into a murderer's room as if it were your own, no hesitation or anything. Do not waste 84 minutes of your life watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent remake, but still not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The recent trend of remaking classic horror movies is hopefully on the decline, but not without leaving several horrible films in its wake. Very few ever come close the original but with "Black Christmas" in 2007 the filmmakers did a good enough job not to embarrass themselves, and actually make a decent movie.Taking place within a sorority house the day before Christmas break a group of girls and their house mother are terrorized by a former inhabitant named Billy Lenz. Billy has quite the back story and its told in flashbacks throughout the movie. Its extremely disturbing and involves murder, incest, and all those beloved family pastimes. Born with yellow skin and rejected by his psychotic mother, Billy lives most of his life locked in the attic. As a teenager Billy is raped by his mother and she has a baby girl. When he finally gets out he kills his mother and makes Christmas cookies out of her skin (Yummy!!). His sister disappears and Billy is caught and sent to a mental hospital. Years later he escapes (naturally) and heads back home to the now sorority house.The girls start receiving prank calls and one by one they start to disappear. The story had been modernized from the original 1974 version. Cell phones play a big part, as well as computers. Although the characters and killings do bear some resemblance to the original. Like a lot or horror remakes this is more of a re-imagining of the story rather that a shot for shot remake. A lot of horror clichés are used but are used effectively. The girls are pretty one dimensional and serve as victims quite well. There is a big shock ending that makes you sort of rethink a lot of what you just saw. Paying close attention to the flashbacks should help. Unlike a lot of the recent remakes which water down the violence and gore to get a PG-13 rating "Black Christmas" takes pleasure in making it R rated with gruesome kills and gory pieces all over. The DVD includes a "making of" and Director's notebook features and is definitely worth a buy. You can find used copies for very cheap all over the internet. The original 1974 film is also available on DVD and blu-ray and is essential viewing for all horror fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently saw this movie, after reading a lot of negative comments about this movie. I can say this movie is absolutely not as bad as they say. Firstly you can not compare it to the original. Where the original showed no gore and was creepy, this one is more entertaining and gory!! Okay it is CHEESY, but it is hell of fun!! Don't expect a solid story like SAW, but just open your minds and enjoy the ride to a fun slasher flick done 80's style. Just bare in mind that the UK version is different to uncut US version. At least one murder is completely different and the end is also different! So if you liked the movie, you maybe interested at giving a look at the American uncut version! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this in the rental shop and thought what the hell how bad can it be? Considering that I have not seen the original and it is made by the team who made Final Destination I was expecting a good horror. What i got was a slightly above average horror flick. This review has to be seen under the view that I am talking about big budget horror movies from Hollywood not cheap movies. Each have their relative merits. Plot.A child who has a nasty upbringing because he is yellow in colour slaughters his family. This is what the plot wants us to believe. Actually he murders his paedophile mother, his step father and mutilates his daughter. His mother molests him half way through the movie in a seen which i am sure is meant to be funny. I like horror not movies about sexual deviants who pray on their kids. A university sets it campus up and uses his house as a girls dorm. Of course this mass murderer does not want to stay locked up and comes out to slice and dice the new inhabitants of his house. Thoughts. This is a by the numbers slasher movie. The characters are their only for slasher fodder and they make the usual denizens of horror movies look like professors. Yep these characters are a daft bunch. Everything is so predictable and it feels like a PG13 as the violence really has been toned down. Don't think of the burning think of Scream which a bit more gore and you will have the gore. What saves this movies from being a complete turkey is that it is competently made. Also if you have not watched many slashers this might be scary. On the downside is the plot which is daft and predictable. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel almost bad about not giving this film a favorable review?almost. I have these feelings because, when the lead characters begin to die, "Black Christmas" becomes a relatively effective slasher flick. Unfortunately, that comes all too late and lasts for only a short time, with most of the characters being killed off in a twenty minute interval. Certainly, when they do die, they die with enough sprayed blood and creativity to make even the most jaded gore-hound wince, but that cannot make up for the fact that the rest of this film's runtime is dedicated to some of the worst flashbacks in recent memory and a lot of under-developed drama between our soon-to-be victims, as well as a lifeless whodunit that is never entertaining or compelling. The remake of a rather ingenuous little slasher flick of the same name, "Black Christmas" had a large legacy to live up to and, though it might be passable to some, it stumbles in its forefather's shadow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And again and again I am warning people, and I know it gets boring, not to fall for titles like, from the makers of. Be sure that you have a bad movie in your hands. This is the remake of the classic from '74. Well, remake, won't say that it is a remake. The basic is there and that's all I can say. Even with a cameo of a girl from the original it's still bad. There is no suspense in it. It's just a slasher with a superior killer. The killings are mostly off screen. The acting of the girls isn't what we suspect of this kind of movie. Were the original had his suspense, like the plastic bag, here the plastic bag isn't frightening. Were most people thought that the close up of the eye was a creepy shot, even in the remake it isn't chilling. It's weird, but nothing really works in this film. The close up of the eye isn't what it should be and the killer itself is to say the least, laughable. The gratuitous nudity is there but even that fails. It's shot from behind. how is it possible that writers who made Final Destination could make a good film like that and failed in this remake. Please stop those turkey remakes, better go stuff the turkey instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good things:) 1. It included a great cast of professional, attractive, hot and likable actresses, Michelle Tratchenberg, Katie Cassidy, Mary Elisabeth Winstead, Andrea Martin, Lacey Chabert.2. The highly successful original 1974 movie is a great film to modernize. As it has great ideas and a good concept.3. The look and warm colors created a nice cosy feel to it. It maintained the horror in warmth darkness.4. The Sorority house was nice and luxurious 5. Andrea Martin who played as Phyllis in the Original starred as the house mother in this one, which was a good attempted to honor the original.6. The DVD cover looks cool.Bad Things :( 1. The Music seems outdated/old style which doesn't match the modern look that it possessed. It makes the film seem cheap and more like a straight to DVD film or a TV movie.2. The original characters weren't used such as: Jess Bradford, Luitenant Fuller, Peter, Barbara, Phyllis. Although Lauren played by the sexy Crystal Lowe was based on the original Barbara played by Margot Kidder. They made the character rude and "bitchy," whereas Margot Kidder in the original was more likable and funny.3. They left out the whole involvement of the Police story that was a big part of the original film which kept the movie serious and interesting.4. Too much of the killers childhood was revealed. Whereas in the original the killer was barely mentioned giving it a mysterious fear-of-the-unknown thought. The killers childhood should have been briefly mentioned at the start then continuing onto the present part of the story.5. The killers childhood was sleazy disgusting. And seemed more comedic than scary.6. The Storyline should have been based more closely on the 1974 original film.7. The Killers: Agnes who is an inbred daughter, of whom looks like a transvestite and is disappointingly funny. Billy, who is the father and has the same MOTHER...ew He also isn't scary either, he looks like an ordinary guy tbh. One of the killers has a rare liver disease causing yellowing of the skin, which looks weird and silly.8. It included Bad cheesy dialog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An up side down reality, version 1.03</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fun story of murder and mayhem, first time round. While I prefer a pacifist approach, I could accept this for a couple of viewings. Third time round it started to be too much. I did want to see it more than once, though. * Michelle Trachtenberg in a role that allows her to show a cool and detached head, calmly using her poise and dignity to lead herself on a path that obviously leads to her death. This is acting, a different sort of acting to other stuff of hers that I have seen. To me she is the star and to others there is a wide variety of possible stars. Most end up cool and detached too. Most end up cool and detached sooner. For girl stuff, at late 2008 I rated MT most in Pete Pete, then Gadget and Christmas Wish. Young woman, Buffy and Ice Princess. So bits of these did well and bits did black x, that is par. All link well with Black Xmas. Gadget is brilliant for nice guy, Christmas Wish not far off. As an MT fan I am not disappointed with Black Xmas, well not for the first two viewings, though I would have preferred that she had been 'the one who lived' rather than becoming badly need company, badly needed soul food. That Gretchen Wieners turns into soul food should be no surprise, but one hopes for better ways. That there is also Elizabeth and Jessica and Lila ? * Try to take this story at face value it does not stand. A lot of fairly good fiction has some weak points in its logical structure, but this might take that a bit too far. I read this as likely an up side down story about up side down worlds. This reminds me of Dutch fireworks storage and escape codes. That or Gadget askew. Interpret? I need to be careful. I prefer to continue liking this feature, though the third viewing does mess that up. Suspicious, how it got to be no go for me on the third time round. Best I forget it. If it is not too late. After I posted version 1.00 I worked to try to like Gadget and Christmas Wish more, a lot of work that included taking care not to look during the penada, but I like the results. Recently I have discovered Forever Together, aka Can't Be Heaven and that is nice guy with a dreamy reality. That does help in re-evaluating early Dawn, who now seems frisky kitten, impressive. Then A Father's Choice, impressive again. These have a very different flow to this particular Christmas story. This is way different compared to her other stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black X-Mas, BESTWORST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are bad movies, and then there is "Black Christmas," or as the DVD box calls it, "Black Xmas" (undoubtedly a reference to E.E. Cummings). Black Christmas isn't just bad, it's awful and shocking in a manner that I usually expect only from new Black Eyed Peas singles. "Black Christmas" is the Olympics of bad. It's the 8th wonder of the world bad. It's Uwe Boll bad.Black Christmas tells the story of a creepy guy killing various nubile femmes during a snowy evening. Many people die from falling objects, including an icicle, from 4 feet overhead. Then, they throw a flaming Christmas tree through a wall.It's a coat hanger abortion of a movie that is too standard to interest the hardcore genre fans and too grisly to work for the casual viewer. Every decision is wrong. Every moment forced. Yes, there is a plethora of attractive female leads, but a good horror film this does not make.Fortunately, black Christmas is bad in the way that few films are. It's mesmerizing bad. It's hilariously bad. It's the kind of movie you realize is stupid, even when you're watching it stoned, which is the only way I can really recommend anyone watching it, (I was sober by the way). And that's its biggest strength. The movie is drenched in a kind of morbid, "how bad can this possibly get" type vibe.From the girl with the 6 inch thick glasses that make her face look like an anime character to the reveal of the killer, to the flaming Christmas tree thrown inside of a wall, everything in this movie is insane. The filmmakers looked at Christmas and tried to think of every single imaginable way to deface the holiday. As an agnostic male of Jewish descent, I found this terribly amusing. Unfortunately, it's done with all the panache of a 9-year old just learning swear words and so, it's markedly less effective than say, "Bad Santa" after which "Black Christmas" seems to be modeled.But, unlike Billy Bob Thornton's curmudgeonly Magnum Opus , Black Christmas never generates any warmth from it's black coal of a heart and so the whole affair ends up as lifeless as the various corpses strewn across the screen.The film is a remake of Bob Clark's second most frightening film (behind Baby Geniuses 2: Super Babies) but it basically ignores everything that film had to offer. I haven't seen it in years, but I don't recall the method of killing, the motivation or the ending being even vaguely similar. There is the clear plastic suffocation thing going on still and the Christmas setting, but otherwise, this film totally abandons everything cool about the original, including the ambiguous ending.There are a few nice camera angles, but overall this movie feels like amateur hour. Written and directed by Glen Morgan, (sans his usual partner James Wong), before being forced into massive reshoots just weeks before its release, Black Christmas hits only sour notes. But it does so in a sort of compelling way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I was very anxious to see this "remake" (yes, another) as I'm a massive fan of the original. The old Black Christmas was simply terrifying and is in my opinion one of the scariest, creepiest horror's ever made. I knew from the get go, whatever they came up with, was never going to beat it. But I didn't think it would be this bad. Really.It's just so, monotonous. They didn't even try.If you've seen the original, you'll know how horrifying those "phone calls" are. The remake tries to duplicate the same results and fails miserably. I mean they are laughable at best. The movies biggest problem and flaw is the constant flashbacks of Billy's childhood. In the first movie, We didn't know if he was Billy. To be quite honest we didn't really care. It was so scary that a random man happened to walk by a sorority house, and the sick twisted person he is, thought it would be fun to hide up in their attic and kill them off one by one. This was terrifying - still is. But the remake tries to give us a reason why he's always shouting for Agnes, why he doesn't want anyone to know what they did, we don't need one. We don't need reasons. This new version is so generic and boring. It takes anything from everything in a modern day horror film and isn't afraid to show it. The acting was bad, the effects were bad, man everything was bad.GET THE ORIGINAL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really is not a good film compared to the 1974 original. Even though I have not seen the original, I am almost certain that it is way better than this pointless 2006 re-make. I rented it from Blockbuster and it was a complete waste of time renting. It seems that this film is just a typical gore-fest, and even some of the gore was fake. The blood that they used when Leigh slipped on the floor looked like thick red paint. Some of the "deaths" didn't make sense like Melissa and Lauren having their eyes gouged out. You wouldn't die from that. Melissa's US death didn't make sense because the ice-skate would not have completely cut off the back of her head. They made all the sorority sisters seem so weak and vulnerable! It was like (I'm talking about Melissa's UK death) it was like Melissa just lay there and let Agnes pull out her eye! Don't you think she would have fought back?! And, even though Ms Mac was a lovely character, it was like she just stood there waiting for the icicle to come down and kill her! The most stupid death of all, one that I actually laughed at, was Claire's. It was just so fake! It was like they got a foot-ball and stuck it under a bag and made someone put a pen into it because you couldn't even see were the pen supposedly went into Claire's eye (again, how could she die from that?). All of them knew that there was a serial killer on the loose in the house, so they split up and left Melissa alone in the house. It would have made way more sense if they had just all stayed in the living room together and not let each other out their sight until the police had come. They didn't explain why Agnes liked to gouge out eyes and then eat them, that part of the film was horrible. I think that Melissa should have survived as well because not enough people survived. I really would not recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A child- Billy - is born by a seriously pathological mother. She kills his father in company with a lover one Christmas night and later rapes her own son who is locked away in the attic. Out of this intercourse comes a daughter. Billy goes on a killing spree on another Christmas eve and kills his mother and lover and mutilates his own daughter/sister ? Agnes - by pulling one of her eyes out. He is caught and put in an institution for the criminally insane (which is actually written on a sign in that institution). Apparently Agnes and Billy has developed some kind of eye fetish which really spices up the killings in the movie. You now have some ingredients that comes together to create a "black Christmas". The house where Billy lived is now a sorority house and we watch how all the pretty girls living there gets killed one by one. Billy escapes from his prison/institution in the most unlikely circumstances and is ready to go back and pick of where he left. Everything is predictable and again you have a story that develops only because everybody acts in a totally retarded way. I will not even bother to describe the flaws in this movie. It reminded me to a certain point of Carpenters "Halloween" but lacks the acting of a Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis.If you want cinematic junk food watch this movie. Just remember that you will never get those 80 minutes back again./Simon</fullReview>

But the film never gives them an opportunity.The mess of a plot, editing etc show how much the film has been messed about with and shows all the signs of the arguments between glen morgan and the studio etc. For example, the 'supposed' mystery and surprise of Billy and Agnes. How can Billy be doing the killing when he's still in the asylum? My favourite thing about the film is the alternate ending on the DVD with the mobile phone, which is very subtle, creepy and in spirit with the original film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and lacked the elements that could have made it good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas could have been good at least a five or six, but there were several things done so badly wrong that it ruined the movie for me. I really couldn't believe how bored I was through the whole movie. The only mildly interesting part was the flashbacks to Billy's childhood. Even this could have been better done. I am not a film student or anything, but it seems they could have used something better than just straight cuts to the flashbacks complete with date. Maybe seeing through the killers eyes as something in the house triggers a flashback. The second big issue I have with the movie is the abrupt switch between the girls constantly fighting and sniping at each other and their "Yea girl power!" attitude towards the end, not to mention the fact that not one single character in the movie made me care whether they lived or died. The biggest problem to me was the killings themselves. I know they set up why he kills the way he does, but come on a little variation would be nice. Oh well live and learn I should have listened to the reviews on IMDb</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something new for a change then ... All kidding aside, this isn't the most original plot out there, but considering it's a remake and the original was based on the same premise. You can forgive and/or better forget that! The setting is clear, it's Christmas (hence the title), you got girls (of course you have to have girls) and a killer. Is there anything more you need? Of course nice "death scenes". You have to judge for yourself, if there are enough and/or good scenes here for you, but to me it all felt mediocre. It wasn't a surprise that I didn't felt compelled to the characters. A nice little slasher then, nothing more, nothing less!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was awful...the original was so much better and so much more compelling...the '74 release of this title had so much to it and it set the bar for countless slasher flicks that followed such as: Halloween, Friday The 13th, and A Nightmare On Elm Street. Prior to '74, slasher flicks really weren't done...What made the original so compelling is you never saw the killer...Save for maybe hands, an eye or a voice...in this one he's right there in plain sight on a number of occasions and that takes away the mysticism and creepiness of the release, then they bring in another killer, which was just overkill and strange, and then they tried to give you a background story of why the killer is the way he is and why he does what he does which is clever if done correctly, which it wasn't. In conclusion all's this was was a confusing mishmash of unnecessary blood and gore (Which I'm all for, if it's done right, but not if it is just thrown in your face for no good reason.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original black Christmas when this one was at the theatre. I thought the original was OK the acting wasn't all that great it was a creepy movie but, it was just OK for me. I am a huge fan of the 80's horror films this flick had all of those elements from its over the top gore to its overly used foul language something horror films don't do these days because of the pg13 rule. All in all this movie entertained mt the girls were funny and it was shot very well to be honest i feel that this outdoes the original by a longshot, if you are a fan of the 80's horror flicks and you want to be entertained pick it up you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very derivative slasher film. It felt like the director and actresses were simply going through the motions and repeating every single other slasher film that's been made, notably the Halloween and Friday 13th films. Some other reviewers have said that they liked the fact that all of the Soriety sisters had different personalities so you cared about them. I'm afraid that I had trouble telling them apart, they all (but one) had very similar hair, makeup and personalities. The one who was different (Eve) was so notably different - with her thick glasses, that it made you wonder how she ever got into the sorority in the first place - surely she'd have been blackballed during Rush Week. There was really nothing original in this film - even the "double killer" was done with the Scream series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director/Script:Glen Morgan (Based on the 1974 screenplay by Roy More), Cast: Katie Cassidy (Kelli), Michelle Trachtenberg (Melisa), Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Heather), Lacey Chabert (Dana), Kristen Cloke (Leigh), Andrea Martin (Ms. Mac), Crystal Lowe (Lauren), Oliver Hudson (Kyle), Kathleen Kole (Eve).I think that people's opinion of this movie is going to be largely divided. There will be many young people (who perhaps are not familiar with the original film) that think it is absolutely great and of course many fans of the original that will think it 'sucks'. When I review a remake, I try to do so with and open mind and not always compare it with the original film. I am certainly guilty of this! One thing many fans of the original can agree on regardless of their opinion of this film is that it will certainly bring a lot of attention to the obscure original. Then again, us horror fanatics (like myself!) get a little possessive of our movies. We don't want them to appeal to the masses. So who knows.This is the second remake attempt by director Glen Morgan. The other was Willard. I thought Willard was a good film, perhaps better than the original.His second remake attempt was of course,Black Christmas. It is a totally different script and with just a couple of exceptions has different characters. The similarities are of course the title, the concept of the sorority house, and the 'Billy' and 'Agnus' characters. In the first film, we never really get to know who the killer is. Who 'Billy' was is left a mystery. I think this is what made the first film such a classic. Much of the first half of this film is devoted to telling the story of 'Billy' and 'Agnus'. We are told about Billy's background and what led him to kill. We also find out who Agnus is. As it turns out, the sorority house was Billy's childhood home and a lot of bad things happened to him there! Most of the murder and mayhem occurs during the second half of the film. Morgan uses a lot of fast passed action to move the film along which builds to a climatic ending. The first film was much more plot and character driven whereas this uses more visuals. Also, we see a lot more graphic violence in this one. Eye balls gouged out (and eaten!), severed heads etc. I actually find the over the top gore to be rather tongue-and cheek. Being a huge fan of the original, I had long anticipated seeing this film. Overall all, I was not disappointed. I appreciate the fact that they did not just rehash the original script. I think they did a good job telling the story of Billy. The films biggest weakness was the lack of character development and personality in the characters. I find this a problem in many of today's films. All the actors seems the same! You will not see anybody with the class of Oliva Hussey, the sarcastic wit of Margot Kidder or cool like John Saxon. Although I was glad to see Andria Martin from the original in this film, I wish they would have given her a different part. I kind off wish they would have made her character more like the house mother in the original. She is a comedian as well as an actress. I think they made her too serious. See for yourself if he did justice to Bob Clark's original. I knew I wouldn't be able to do this review without comparing it to the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All right, but could've been better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I had very high expectations for this movie. The movie was fun to watch, and it was pretty okay. The acting in my opinion, was great, with the exception of a few characters who were unconvincing at some points. The plot was okay. The deaths, to me, were okay at most. Many deaths were off screen, and those on screen were too quick or a bit repetitive. Many deaths were either a blood splat on some surface, or getting bagged while having your eyes take out, which annoyed me constantly.There were a few things that irked me throughout the film, and what could've solved the problem. Fist of all, Dean Friss's role of Agnes, was....disturbing at least. A man in what looks like in his 40s playing a girl who is supposed to be in her twenties? That's scary. Another thing that disappointed me was the fact that Katie Cassidy's character, Kelli, was the sole survivor. With such a large cast and two killers, I think it would've been much better to have it end much in the same manner as the original, with something that makes the audience think, or at least another survivor, without having both killers dead.All in all, the movie was fun to watch, but it won't win any awards. I give Black Christmas a 5.5/10 which rounds up to a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen the original, but I can still almost guarantee this is not a good homage to that film. As a matter of fact, it's not a good homage to horror films in general. It lacks any true scares or surprises because it is truly too short to set anything up. This is a good thing. The movie is poorly acted, but not near as bad as it could have been. So let me separate this into a couple of categories.The Bad 1. Not Scary- there aren't really too many GOOD jump out scares and not even any real tension, which spells trouble for a horror movie.2. No surprises- everything is truly spelled out for you in this film. No surprises, no twists, it's just there for you to watch.3. Bad death scenes- most of the time they just showed blood splatter, and a couple of them were not a chance in hell possible.4. Bad killer- just wasn't scary, had no emotion, especially after what had happened to him. He was there, that's it.There is more than this, but those were the main problems for me. And now......The Good 1. Run time- It was short and to the point, kinda like the Walking Tall for horror movies.2. Background- after you see what the killer went through as a child, you understand why he is so messed up.3. Humor- some of the death scenes were good, and it had a kinda satire feel to it. That can be taken as good or bad. But there was some times in this film that they were trying to make you laugh and succeeded.4. Cheese entertainment- being in this movie was like being on a roller coaster, lots of 17 year old girls screaming. It had some moments that were fun, it was short, and a little bit entertaining. It's definitely a nothing else to do that afternoon kind of film, but it was absolutely made to scare a younger crowd and that's all.In closing, if you have seen the original, don't see this, im sure you will be disappointed. If you like cheesy, goofy horror movies the likes of slither or maybe even dead alive, although that was much better, than you should enjoy this. If you are a teenage boy and want to take some girl to a movie, this is it. Im sure it will dismissed rather quickly and on DVD very fast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I definitely wasn't bored while watching this movie. It slowed down for only about 10-15minutes at the most. The body count was really high in this film. The story was really out there but I didn't goto see the movie for the story. A brother and sister couple come back to their old home where they had been raised and horribly abused killing everyone that now lives in their old home. Its now a sorority full of gorgeous young girls! The death scenes wern't original, but there was so many people killed throughout the movie that it really didn't matter. A lot of people got plastic bags over their heads and then got stabbed multiple times in the head/eyes/ears. I went knowing it was going to be a slasher flick. People walked out of the theater at one point in the film when it got alittle gruesome. The killer(s) at one point after killing his mother cuts skin off her back with cookie cutters, cooks them on a sheet-pan in the oven and then rabidly eats them breathing very heavily and spitting blood juice and saliva. The director gives you a close-up of his mouth as this is happening. Thats when people left the theater. The killers die twice in this movie. After they had been left for dead in the burning house they come back to life in the hospital and attempt to kill the remaining survivors.All and all not a bad movie, but not even close to being spectacular.-Tierneyweiser-</fullReview>

Katie Cassidy, who is my favorite actress, i found was the best actress out of this movie. i have never seen the original and after seeing this i don't think i even want to. this movie did not scare me at all and was like a slap in the face for wasting my money. the only thing this movie did to me was making me almost throw up. it was a dissgusting and gruesome movie. One of the worste i have ever seen. there were too many girl characters living in that house. i wished that they would have limited the amount of actors for this film and the amount of blood. Seriously, is it really nessicary to see all of that gore, i can handle blood in a movie and guts and stuff like that, but that was way over done. so out of 10 for this film i give it a 2, at least the acting was good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am game for almost any type of movie. I usually like these type of movies, but this does not even fit in the category of being so bad it is good. It is just bad. I am not sure if it was suppose to be funny or not. All I know is that it was not. The crazy mother was a little over the top and I feel she was the best part of the movie. I can expect to escape some type of reality. But this movie was so dumbed down it was insulting. Has anyone ever been in hospital where they actually close the doors shut? Everybody has a private room. And halls are so dark and empty you need would think the place was abandoned? I saw a movie the other day called Tamara and I swear they used the same hospital. BTW that move was Citizen Kane next to this one Only in horror movies do these hospitals exist. That is so a killer can run freely up and down the hallways while chasing his victims. In this movie the victim actually ran into a crash cart and the tech acted like nothing happened. The coeds were so dumb they had no idea two people were living in their Sorority House for months. The plot is a old one. A bunch of female college students are the target of some madman who has a mommy complex. He use to live in the their house before it was converted into a Sorority House. He has escaped from the crazy house and was set to give them a visit for Christmas. It takes them a while to know people are getting killed upstairs. It will not take you a while to figure out this movie is junk. Don't waste your time. Go look at Tamara instead.</fullReview>

How...nice. I like slasher films, even though some (or many) are clichéd but I like to have a good time watching them. In this film, however, I did not have a good time. It's more disgusting than scary.What's so disgusting about it? Well, the bloody violence, to start with. It turns you off immediately when you watch it, although some kills can be handled. What makes blood and gore so scary? I'd rather watch a PG-13 horror film (which are usually better and scarier than many R rated films; how ironic) than watch a movie filled with gore.There needs to be at least some suspense, right? Yeah, there's just a little here to keep you interested, although you have seen it many times before. The look of the film is good, though and the performance by the ensemble is decent.Do you like body count films? Yeah? Well, go and have a good time having an upset stomach over this! Do you like a good slasher flick? Well, watch something better. This film had potential, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this last night and I have to give this a very poor review. I do not know why, but Bob Clark, who directed the original 1974 version of this film, was a producer for the new one. The original is creepy beyond compare. In the original we never see the killer, the phone calls are a lot creepier, a lot weirder, the subplot of the girl and her boyfriend, and the fact that it does not all take place in the same night make the original Black Christmas a far superior film to this new one. I wanted to watch it and give it a fair shake, I had most remakes, and this would be one of those. I think that it could have been an OK film, if the original had never been made. The content of the film is gross, and I don't mind gore, but this was not relevant to the film, the acting was bad, the back story behind who Billy was in unnecessary, and I felt no pity or compassion for any of the characters. Overall the film was poorly made and left nothing to the imagination and furthermore was just another slash 'em up teen movie remake that never needed to be made, they could have just released the original and I would have went to the theatre to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas is nothing to write home about. I think I have seen the original cult classic but it has been absolutely years so I was kind of looking forward to checking out this remake in hopes it might have some decent surprises. I won't crap too much on this film because I didn't feel like I wasted any time watching it. For what it was worth it was decently entertaining slasher gore flick with no real purpose or story other than to have a killer stalk a sorority house and despite their attempts to give the story some depth it never really works. Even with some decent performances on the part of the main cast, it wasn't written well enough to do much of anything. It's a forgettable but at least watchable campy, horror flick. Director Glen Morgan is quite new to direction, his previous film being Willard which also tanked (I have yet to see it), but this is still no excuse for Mr. Morgan as he has produced and written for some much better films including Final Destination one and three and several episodes of The X-Files. Granted the budget of Black Christmas was quite small although still nearly twenty times what the budget of the original film was.Katie Cassidy plays the as close to the lead girl in the film as the film has. She's the main scream queen so to speak. She does a decent job of running around the house scared for her life but nothing outstanding. She isn't given an incredible script to work with. Michelle Trachtenberg who I do think is a gifted actor in such roles as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, House, and Ice Princess is barely alert as the snotty and annoyed Melissa Kitt. Kristen Cloke, Crystal Lowe, Lacey Chabert (also a decent actress), and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are the rest of the sorority victims and other than being this they serve little purpose to any plot or reason to the film. Besides a light story surrounding the main girl (Cassidy) there is hardly any character development other than watching the girls get taken, phone call to the house, and then murdered in some twisted way. One brighter spot to the film is the performance by Oliver Hudson who plays Cassidy's estranged boyfriend. He is a stronger player and has more personality in general and is more watchable. Since he's dating the main character he is almost certain to live. Veteran Canadian comedienne Andrea Martin plays the Sorority house mother and just seems vapid and annoying with no real purpose.So after covering all this how can I say the film is watchable?? Well from a horror fan perspective there is plenty of death scenes and plenty of blood and the phone calls are a nice touch, if not entirely unoriginal. The hoarse whisper of "They're my family now" adds a certain aspect to the creepy factor. And I give them props for attempting a decent back story on the killer and his sister and opening the film up for plenty of bad sequels which I am all for when it comes to Horror films. Black Christmas might even make you jump but it's predictable, rehashed and slapped together in every sense of the word. True Horror fans might get a kick out of it but everyone else will likely hate it and find it a waste of time. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well you get the point. A true test of whether a sequel is any good is whether it stands on its own. And I can honestly say that this movie falls flat on its face from the sadly pathetic and predictable beginning until the uninteresting and sickly end. I have never seen the first Black Christmas movie and I am eternally grateful to other members of IMDb for informing me that the original is of high quality. I will purchase the 1974 movie at my first opportunity. The movie is about a guy who murdered his family on Christmas and is sentenced to a mental hospital. He escapes the mental hospital on the anniversary of th night he murdered his family -- Christmas. Sounds a lot like Halloween. In the interim period, a sorority has purchased the house and moved in. Most of the sorority have gone home for the Christmas break, but there are a few girls left behind. The movie leaves no doubt that there is a second menacing killer in the house -- now how this second killer would know that Billy would be able to escape on that evening is kind of left to the imagination -- My guess was sunspots or an alien human-dog mind meld -- ala the pet shop guy on the Simpsons. The women back at the sorority are all extremely attractive women who are as beautiful as they are shallow, unpleasant and totally without any concept of common sense whatsoever. I'll spare you any details of how lame the ending is, except to say, if you make it that far without turning off the DVD, you will not be disappointed -- it's REALLY, REALLY bad. Katie Cassidy cannot act to save her soul in this movie. Her performance is not without its charm -- if you like talentless women screaming on camera. Michelle Trachtenberg, whom I consider to be a fairly good actress is pointless in this movie. She is in it a very brief time and her character adds nothing to the movie. They could have hired some unemployed young woman and given her the part. On the positive side this movie...ummmmmm....well...it's over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just like the original-- in title ONLY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lame "remake" of the 1974 classic, bastardized into 2000-ish standards with more shock-gore and bare-skin thrill than the original one which held its own style in being quirky-funny at times.This is merely another run-of-the mill, predictable B-movie horror-flick in the modern style. Even the plot is a loose reworking of the original, with a borrowed title in order to make it "appear to be" a remake of the 1974 classic.Save your time. There are much better modern-day horror-slash-skin flicks. Or, watch the original if it's the quirky-cutesy suspense-horror that you're seeking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black X-Mas - As Scary As A Red Sock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Black X-Mas SPOILERS* It's X-Mas Eve, and all through the sorority House, a killer is sneaking, as silent as a mouse.A few Sorority Sisters are still there, and they get killed one by one with care...Billy Lenz has come home for Christmas, exactly 15 years after having murdered his murderous and abusive mother and stepfather, who had killed his father and raped him in order to get pregnant (the mother, obviously). And the sorority girls - Kelli (Katie Cassidy), Melissa (Michelle Trachtenberg), Heather (Mary-Elizabeth Winstead), Lauren (Crystal Lowe), Eve (Kathleen Kohl), Clair (Leela Savasta), their housemother Mrs. Machenry (Andrea Martin), Kelli's boyfriend Kyle (Oliver Hudson), and Clair's sister Leigh (Kristen Cloke) are the target of Billy and of his (very ugly and possible transsexual) sister/daughter (I would've really liked Kyle smacking Billy and him screaming "She's my sister - slap - she's my daughter - slap - she's my sister AND my daughter! My mother... she was an evil wench...") Agnes (Dean Friss - great as everything else, crap as an actor) 'Black X-Mas' manages to be interesting once in a while (some murders are really scary, the music is top-notch (Shirley Walker we'll miss you), Trachtenberg, Lowe, Martin and Hudson are pretty good), but for the most part is a letdown; the characters do every single thing they should not do (like staying in the house when there is a serial killer nearby, for example), there is way too much gratuitous gore (where the HELL do the eyeballs come from?), even if it isn't very long it drags, the plot outline is more ripped off from 'HalloweeN' (which is also going to be remade) than from the original, of which this movie has only the idea of a killer at Christmas, the ending in the hospital is ridonkulous (the occasion is fitting for the word) and Katie Cassidy is even WORSE here than in 'When A Stranger Calls' (which is no easy feat).I've heard that Glen Morgan's original intentions were really different (and sometimes you can see the movie going in a different direction), but Dimension created this maddening mess, so I lay no blame on him.Dimension Films and Katie Cassidy, though, are to blame. And what's with the idea of Magnes (Man + Agnes, since she looks like a man)? Is this a thriller or a comedy? This is, in the end, yet another lousy remake of a terror classic which makes us understand why this 'remake-mania' is going overboard, and why Big Studios have NO CLUE on how to make a great remake.The 1974 movie still stands as one of the best Christmas thrillers; the 2006 one will stand as one of the worst.Black X-Mas (2006): 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to ask a very simple question, why does Hollywood go for remakes? If you ask me, I think there are two reasons. First, imagination and creativity are nearly depleted. It is very difficult to come up with new ideas. Second,MONEY. Producers want it easily and quickly. What would be better than taking an already created movie, adding some new effects (thanks to modern technology), manipulating the plot or adding subplots (ideas that are rarely good) and in horror movies specifically, adding more screams and gore, which is exactly the case with Black Christmas. The original Black Christmas was a class A horror movie in my opinion. Of course it had some problems with the plot and acting, but the originality of the movie outbalances this. I mean, this movie set standards for later films like Halloween and Friday the 13th. It didn't depend on gore that much, it rather depended on the depth and complexity of the situation of being in a house with a serial killer without knowing it. The killings were few, but the film was still eerie and scary. As for the remake, I would describe it in one word "LAME". It has too many killings. It is too fast paced which leaves no room for depth or audience involvement (I bet that the whole thing can be shot in one or two days). The main plot is fragile (can anyone believe you can escape a sanitarium that easily?). Despite all of this, I was willing to forgive this movie for wasting my time and I would have given it a 4 or 5 out of 10 EXCEPT that the last 10 or 15 minutes were a joke in every sense of the word. The whole hospital thing was a disaster. What are the chances that a killer found on the crime scene by the police go to the morgue without being checked whether dead or not? Come on, what on earth is that? Again, very lame to say the least. The ending in no way compares to the original one. Black Christmas (2006) is a cheap horror flick that unfortunately holds the name of a horror classic. Shame on you Hollywood for tarnishing the beautiful images we have of our horror legacy.</fullReview>

When I saw it, I was expecting a crappy so called "horror" movies that are made nowadays and that's exactly what I got. The story is a good one but the acting and the so called "horror" scenes are terrible. There is a lot of gore if you like those kinds of movies. The scenes involving gore were very well done and that's the only reason this is getting a 2. There was nothing scary about this movie and I didn't even jump up once. I don't know why they would label this as a horror or a thriller movie. I usually do not rate movies this low but this was just bad. I haven't seen the original so I can't really compare. I recommend that you do not watch this movie. Some people seem to like it so if you must then watch it and form your own opinions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>10 dollars down the drain as I sat in laugher during the highly cheesy film, Black Christmas. I wasn't too sure if I was watching a horror picture or scary movie 5 as the acting, special effects, and plot line were all comical. This movie used every cliché in the book with escaped mental patients, sorority girls, predictive death scenes, and cheesy flashbacks. This movie is no more than a low budget slasher flick that should have gone straight to DVD. The pointless gore that was more funny than scary added to the overall cheese factor of this film. The flashbacks were disturbing like the one where he used Christmas cookie cutters to bake his mother's flesh and then wash her down with a cup of milk. I would like to see a horror film that doesn't show the killers motive being "he was abused as a child" as that has been done. The cast was pretty good, as I like Michelle Trachtenberg and Lacey Chabert but they die off quickly. This movie is a big step back for those girls as there acting talents were lowered to screaming loud and running slow. In conclusion this movie isn't worth your movie stub, and YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why? Why would you take a classic horror film and reduce it to cookie-cutter slasher pablum? Apparently, the goal of this remake was to take everything good and unique about the 1974 version and RIP IT OUT by the roots (kind of like Billy and his newfound interest in eyeballs...WTF?). The strength of the original was the fact that we didn't know who the hell it was lurking in the attic. In the new version, we not only know who it is, we know his entire life story (a perverse combination of PSYCHO and THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS). Big mistake. Let's just kill all the mystery from the get-go and we can spoonfeed the audience from here on out because they're brainless cattle who don't deserve anything even remotely intelligent. I was hoping that there were going to be some protesters at the theater when I went so I could inwardly ridicule them. Nope, not a one. Once I left the theater, I was still wishing they'd been there so I could JOIN them, but for entirely different reasons.Imagine, if you will, for just a moment, that the new Texas CHAINSAW, AMITYVILLE HORROR, BLACK Christmas, etc. weren't remakes but originals. 10, 20, 30 years from now, would we be looking at them with the same reverence we afford the originals now? Doubtful. The scariest thing about these remakes isn't that they're horror movies, but that there are many, many more on the horizon. And the movie industry wonders why attendance and theater revenue is down... Two words, Hollywood. E. Nuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Yuletide Dud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the recent glut of remakes being vomited up by Hollyworthless, horror fans over the age of 25 don't have much original to look forward to, and for every good remake like THE HILLS HAVE EYES there are three duds (the atrocious THE FOG, the worthless AMITYVILLE HORROR, the juvenile WHEN A STRANGER CALLS). Sadly, BLACK Christmas, while not as bad as any of those remakes, must fall into the same category. Hopefully Bob Clark was well-paid.Horror fans who haven't seen the original (and if you are a horror fan and haven't, shame on you) will probably enjoy this a little more than those familiar with the 1974 classic, but most will agree it's nothing more than an episodic mess of clichés and missed-opportunities. The situations are preposterous, the murders are gory but repetitive and unexciting, and director Morgan tries to keep the pace so rapid he doesn't develop any sense of dread or suspense until the last 20 minutes or so, and by then it's too late. A very well done set-piece involving a girl stuck behind a wall manages to escalate quite well, showing that Morgan, who did so well with the original FINAL DESTINATION and the underrated WILLARD, can still film a payoff.But that's the heart of the problem with this film, it's all pay-off and no build-up. The actresses are all completely interchangeable: pretty, vapid, bitchy, and unable to deliver the acerbic dialogue with even the slightest hint of believability. One actress (doesn't matter which one, I couldn't tell them apart) delivers a speech about the true origin of Christmas that is supposed to be a witty and shocking centerpiece to the film, but spurts it out with such precision it's as if she memorized it word for word using flash cards just hours before. Even gifted comedian Andrea Martin, who played one of the main girls in the original and here takes over the role of house-mother, seems to be sleepwalking, which is just as well, since a role that was so juicy in the first film is underwritten into obscurity here.There are moments when the film springs to life. I liked some of the attention to detail in the beginning, I loved how they updated the obscene phone calls to incorporate cell phones, the Christmas atmosphere is well-photographed, and Billy's back story is surprisingly well-handled. But everything plugs along at a can't-hardly-wait pace, killing the mood and suspense. The director also uses funky angles, fish-eye lenses, and dangling cameras to try and create a feeling of unease. But this backfires, since there is no narrative drive to connect with, and no time to care. I felt more sympathy for Billy in the early scenes than anyone else in the film.BLACK Christmas can at least be credited for one thing: Many groups have attacked the film for being in spectacularly bad taste (all the Christmas bashing, child abuse, even incest), and for once they are correct. It IS in bad taste, and that's one of its few charms, and one of the few things that work. It's often unpleasant, sure, but it goes for it and doesn't shy away...this is pitch black humor with no tongue-in-cheek.But finally in the end it's just a below average slasher film with big studio production values. Someone somewhere in those big studios is still convinced you have to have a killing, a jump, or a loud noise at least once every five minutes to keep an audience's attention.I'll bet it won't even take that long to forget the entire film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk about thrashing a CLASSIC!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Understand this: I went into this with my expectations set at 0. When I left the theater, my expectations had done something they'd never done before: they went into the negatives!!!! Just when I thought Hollywood had done enough damage to classics such as hills have eyes, tcm, etc, here comes black Christmas and proves me wrong again!Let me say one positive thing: the acting (with the exception of Katie Cassidy) was as good as they could do. I honestly believe it-especially given the Godforsaken script they were given. But, on the slight downside, it's not like it was hard for these actors to portray these roles: Michelle's done buffy, weinstead was just in fd3, and mean girls taught Chabert a thing or 2-it isn't hard to play the conceited bitch. Anyone can pull it off.The total downside was in 1974, which I am a devote fan of, we didn't know why "Billy" killed-he just did. When there is no motive, or no explanation as to why the person kills, it makes the story all the more scary and intense-hence when a stranger calls, etc. But of course, here comes the explanation and as soon as that is given to an audience, there goes the suspenseful terror of why.Now, the plot. Very simple, cookie cutter of the original-well, almost. A houseful of sorority girls are slowly being picked off one by one. The downside isn't the killings-oh, wait,-yes it is! The original relied on our imagination and not blood and guts to scare us. This one does the opposite-it's a no-holes bard with tons more deaths that are over the top and ridiculous.All in all, this movie was the biggest waste of my time in years. Zero stars, shame to all who had a hand in making this abomination, and damn the people in Hollywood for destroying all these beautiful horror classics-now horror has gone from horror to just horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About As Bad As It Can Get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to make certain allowances for the familial horror genre and the sorority house sub-genre, as their target audiences do not place a premium on intelligent scripting, even the few of them who actually have the capacity to appreciate it. Yet even by the low brain wattage standards of its genre, "Black Xmas" (2006) ranks pretty near the bottom. It you are looking for self-parody elements the pickings are very slim. The only good one is what the production designers did in setting up the 1991 flashback scene of the kitchen. Instead of a 1991 kitchen they give you a 1948ish "Christmas Story" kitchen complete with a returnable glass milk bottle, a self-reflexive reference to that film's director Bob Clark, who also directed the original "Black Christmas" (1974). More obvious is having Michelle Trachtenberg's character impaled on an ice skate blade (insert "Ice Princess" 2005 here). It used to be that even when this type of film failed on multiple levels: stupid plot (insert talent challenged here), impossibly contrived story (insert lazy here), implausibly indestructible and all-knowing villain (insert lazy again), bad acting and directing (insert talent challenged again), shoddy editing (insert damage control here); it still managed to be a least somewhat creepy. Even something as awful as "Cabin Fever" managed that (although I'm still not sure how). And even the worst of the horror parodies and el-cheapo exploitation efforts contained enough hot babes in sexy situations that there was some reason to watch the screen. This might be the most puzzling element about "Black Xmas", simply because it would have been so easy to include it. Why would you make the setting a sorority house and then ignore the opportunity to insert those elements? Good grief the director had both Trachtenberg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the cast; two of the hottest looking actresses in Hollywood. Yet they are only shown in wide master shots with lighting as dim as the scriptwriter's brain activity level. In fact the only genuinely homely actress (Crystal Lowe-whose face looks strangely rearranged and who really should avoid scenes with someone who looks like Trachtenberg) in the entire cast gets all the well- lighted close-ups (insert the sound of gagging here). And they wonder why these things lose money. I'll also point out a major violation of the principles governing the language of film. I don't know if this was ignorance, stupidity, or accident but an error this basic causes a viewer to have total contempt for the production. The film opens with two murders in the sorority house and yet you see that Billy Lentz (the villain) is still locked up in the hospital. Then we get a flashback to the 1975 conception of Billy's sister. They go out of the flashback with a shot of the baby sister, to a match cut close-up of Eve, the somewhat odd (creepy??) sorority sister (although even in nerd glasses she is yet another actress Lowe should stay away from). In film an edit like this is supposed to communicate (director to viewer) a subtle (but always truthful) clue that Eve is Billy's sister; so later you look back and see that the clue was there to see that Eve had committed the murders that occurred prior to Billy's escape. It would have been a terrific cut and at the time it really raised my expectations the film would be working on multiple levels. Unfortunately Eve is killed almost immediately after, which tends to support the theory that the edit occurred entirely by accident. Speaking of editing, one thing that made the original so effective was the subtle juxtapositions of violence and gore with gently twinkling Christmas lights, songs, traditions, and a feeling or warmth. The remake attempts to capture this same thing but the images are so contrived (both the violence and the decorations) that you never buy into either and even if their was effective editing (there isn't) it could not save the day. As bogus as the production is, the most glaring scenes are those that might be considered under the classification of drama. The romance and the sudden appearance of an older sister come to mind as some of the worst acted sequences you are likely to find in any mainstream production. And of course the completely unnecessary insertion of an older actress only takes away from the screen time of the already underutilized "attractive" actresses. What was that about wondering why these things lose money? Toward the end the story has to throw out any remaining credibility and ask that you suspend all disbelief and believe that the extremely low-budget storm outside has caused cross-town rescuers a two-hour delay when the characters have been coming and going without incident up until that moment. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painful To The Very End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I would would like to extend special thanks to the theater I saw this at for accepting my free pass. Saving me the $10.00 I would have otherwise spent on this piece of crap is the greatest gift anyone could have given me this Christmas.Actually I can't say I was disappointed by it because I thought it looked terrible and it was. Though I would like to state for the record that despite the fact that I am a huge fan of the 1974 version I went into this film with an open mind hoping that it would justify itself to me by holding it's own with the original. Well, it failed. It failed miserably.The plot is so unbelievably stupid that I don't even know where to begin. A bunch of sorority girls are holed up in a beautiful mansion sized house for the holidays. Of course the house has a history and was once the scene of a horrific murder or two. Back in 1970 a boy by the name of Billy lived there. His alcoholic mother hated him because he looked so much like his father (who was actually a nice guy). The mother finds herself a new man and has to off the father. Little Billy sees this so the mother locks him up in the attic and subjects him to a life of abuse. Don't fall asleep, there is more to this story. Flash forward to 1982 and we see the mother enjoying life with her new man. Well being that the new guy is a drunk too he can never seem to finish the deed when they are having sex. What's a girl to do? Solution! Go up to the attic and rape your son. She then becomes pregnant with her son's child. Nine months later she gives birth to a girl named Agnes. Flash forward to 1991. She adores little Agnes (oh and by the way this may be the grossest family unit I ever seen on screen. They make the Sawyer family from the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' look pretty sexy) and Billy is just not having it. He finally goes on a murderous rampage and kills his entire family.Or does he? Flash forward to 2006 and here we are back at the house with the girls. With the exception of Lacey Chabert (who I also thought stole the show in 'Mean Girls') these actresses couldn't act worth a damn. Paris Hilton suddenly looks like Dame Judi Dench compared to some of these broads. Chabert only has about four lines but two of them are the best in the entire movie. The girls are all given their own beaten to death stereotypical personality. That includes a spoiled rich girl, an uptight Christian, the drunk, the slut, the innocent one and Michelle Trachtenberg (I have never really understood where Trachtenberg fits in anything I've seen her in.) Andrea Martin (who you may remember from the original 'Black Christmas') returns only this time she is playing the part of the den mother. It was nice to see her again but I'm sad to say that was way too over the top in this film. But she's not the only one! Wait until you get a load of the chick who plays Billy's mother.Getting back to the storyline......Billy escapes from a mental institution and is on his way back home to do what he does best. The girls receive threatening phone calls but are unable to leave the premises due to a really bad snowstorm. People start getting bumped off one by one. Now this movie has a few pathetic twists and turns so even though Billy is set up as the lead killer it becomes quite clear that he is not the only one responsible for the carnage. This leads to an annoying parade of suspects who just show up inexplicably out of nowhere.This movie should have been called 'The Dummies Guide To Clichés' since it uses EVERY SINGLE ONE KNOW TO MAN. Wait, I take that back! It did not contain a cat popping out scene and that is probably it's most creative surprise. There are no good scares and I sat very still in my chair during all of the scenes that were intended to make the audience jump. Not good.This film does not follow the same path of the original by crafting a suspenseful and creepy tale. Instead it chooses to go down the gore route. So how does the gore fair? Not very impressive in the first hour (the camera cuts away too soon during the kills and/or we just get the same old tired ass shot of blood spraying against the wall. YAWN.) However it does get much better in the last half hour. There is one actual 'DAYUM!!!!' death scene and some very cool yet not very Martha Stewart like Christmas decorations.The only other nice thing I can say about 'Black Christmas(2006)' is that the filmmakers gorgeous use of colors and lighting translate into some big screen eye candy. On the other side of the coin, it works against the film too. It almost looks as though they were trying to make a Tim Burton version of a slasher movie. And unlike chocolate and peanut butter that is not a combination that goes well together.So what can else can I say? This film is a mess from start to finish. My advice would be to avoid it. Avoid it like you avoided that Carmen Electra/Dave Navarro reality T.V. show</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Satisfy Slasher Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film is no classic, and certainly doesn't come close to matching the original, it should satisfy its audience -- those craving lurid, gruesome shocks amid the otherwise feel-good fare playing during Christmas.From the start, the film abandons its predecessor's subtle, suspenseful approach to the story of a maniac preying on unsuspecting sorority sisters. Instead, the makers of this film dump loads of gore on the story. Actually, after this year's anemic, highly predictable When a Stranger Calls, I was relieved that this film's makers --perhaps sensing that the hoary premise itself, saddled with the usual slasher clichés, couldn't stand alone on its own merits -- saturated the film in deliciously outrageous blood-and-guts gore. Alas, some of the kills aren't as gory as I was expecting, based on what I had read on the Internet, but they nevertheless should satisfy the gore connoisseur.Perhaps the best parts of the film are scenes depicting Billy's back story. These scenes, packed with the debauched details of abuse by Billy's monstrous mother, appear in patches throughout the film whenever the present narrative threatens to become too boring and predictable.Also on display are steaming HOT chicks lined up for slaughter. The actress playing Lacey and actress Michelle T. (of Buffy fame) are particularly striking presentations of female pulchritude. Alas, the nudity, unlike the gore, is sparse, though the short scene of nudity to which we are treated leaves us wanting more.Overall, though the film presents some interesting gore and a deliciously lurid back story for its antagonist, this new version ultimately fails to attain the general sense of depravity its makers presumably intended -- its graphic set pieces often undermined by pedestrian direction and a predictable script. Nonetheless, the sticky, squishy special-effects, the Court-TV-like back story, and the sexy women on display should satisfy real horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violence and Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas (2006) uncut U.S. version *** (out of 4) Incredibly violent and rather trashy remake of Bob Clark's 1974 classic does what any remake should do; it offers us something new. The basic storyline is still in place but this remake goes for a totally different approach to the subject matter and with all the insane violence in this film it's really no wonder there was so much protest when this was released last Christmas. The story is pretty simply as a group of college girls are in their house and are eventually picked off one by one. There's no doubt that the 1974 version is a better made movie that features better director and better acting but style is not what this remake went for. Instead of style and atmosphere this remake gives us non-stop violence, which is so gory and over the top that you can help enjoy it on that level. Yes, there are many plot holes here as new characters are introduced by for a slasher film this pretty much delivers all the goods. The one interesting change to this film is that we see flashbacks of what happened to the killer when he was a child. At first I didn't know what these scenes were trying to do but they add to a few plot twists that make them worth watching. There are several references to the first film including the rocking chair and the attic as well as references to various other early slashers. The film also takes a very strong hatred feel towards religion and Christmas as there are several scenes talking bad about the two and other scenes where statues of Jesus are shown falling and various other things. I'm not sure how much of the violence made it into the theatrical version but this uncut version is pretty damn brutal with some incredibly graphic violence (including some to kids) and a sexual situation that I won't spoil since it's part of a plot change. Again, if you want a classy horror film then stick with the original. If you just want an old fashioned slasher with a pinch of a Euro giallo then this film is right up your alley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody and funny Christmas ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several girls stay in the sorority house for a Christmas evening, that is located in the house where 15 years ago crazy Billy Lenz killed his whole family. And when girls start to disappear one by one it is getting clear, that the killer returned home for the holidays. The movie is a remake of 1974's motion picture that was in the roots of slasher genre. However for the past 3 decades this genre has almost bog down. So the authors (that came from the 'Final Destination' trilogy) have chosen quite original way of mixing bloody horror movie with a black comedy. It made the movie looks more interesting, but at the same time destroyed the tension in most of the scenes. There are lots of gore scenes in the movie (cookies made of skin, ripping of the eyes, etc), but at the end of the day it's not scary. Obvious plus of the movie is what is called 'dream cast': sorority is filled with beautiful starlets like Katie Cassidy 'When A Stranger Calls'), Michelle Trachtenberg ('Buffy' TV-Series), Lacey Chabert ('Mean Girls'), Crystal Lowe and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (both from 'Final Destination 3'). However there is no sign of personalities' exposure: they aren't quite clichéd, but they all have too little screen time. Kristen Cloke ('Final Destination') and Andrea Martin (who appeared in the original movie) are both good, too. Murders are quite original, as the appearance of the killer. Finale is predictable, but still entertaining. By the way in Russia we've got the UK cut of the movie ? there is an American version of the movie, in which one of the murder scenes was shorten and the finale was changed a little bit (in a bad way). So it's good that we at least got the best from what was available. In the conclusion I can say, that this movie is a pure entertainment, that can become a nice present for the horror fans. Nice girls, unstoppable massacre ? what else do you need for a perfect Christmas? Happy Holidays!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one watching this could argue there is anything remotely resembling an original idea here. From the killers "motivations", to the method in which the victims are dispatched, we've all seen it before. It was a nice touch to have a back story told through flashbacks, but the emphasis there was on the disturbing scenes for the sake of shock, and not on explaining motivation, which we simply have to cobble together on our own. Despite this lack of information most will guess the killers identity before the end. Having one killer "unknown" while the other is seen committing his murders leaving no hint of mystery is a nice touch though. They got a lot of talented actresses to appear in this schlock, I can only assume they were all going through dry patches in their careers. From a technical point of view I can't fault it. Scenes are shot well, editing is good, but the cant make up for the overall feel of the movie, which is the afore mentioned lack of originality. I know this is a remake of the 1974 film of the same name, and even stars one of the original actors, but the question I have is, did this film really need to be remade? I don't believe so, and I think it's a symptom of the lazy and over all lack of originality sweeping the American movie industry now. As a rule of thumb, I no longer bother with remakes or sequels when they come out and only see them later, if they get great reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do like a decent slasher movie and was quite looking forward to this as the original which I haven't seen as yet, is supposed to be pretty good. Unfortunately it turned out to be a bit of a let down. The plot has been done to death and is pretty mundane. What often lifts a predictable slasher is the quality of the cast, regrettably the acting in this is pretty weak even from the very pretty Elisabeth Mary Winsted. The scares are light and there is a surprising lack of tension and suspense. You don't really get to know the characters who are almost uniformly unsympathetically played and therefore you feel nothing for them once the inevitable slaughter begins. This film adds nothing to the slasher genre and strikes me as just a lazy rip-off especially considering the budget it had. One of the poorest slasher films of recent times. A pretty woeful effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ho Ho Holy crap, this movie is awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Devoid of suspense or any real scares to speak of, this ill-advised update of Black Christmas is a remake in name only. While generous dollops of bloodshed are tacked on to fill the void left by the absence of anything resembling horror, the end result is a yuletide mess, and genre fans hoping for a film worthy of sharing a double feature with their annual screening of Silent Night, Deadly Night won't find a present worth opening here.A big schism erupts within the first five minutes of the movie, where we see our first buxom victim meet her fate just before we cut to a mental hospital, where we are given the back-story of a lunatic named Billy, who killed and ate his mother a ways back and who still tries to escape the asylum every December so that he can "be home for Christmas." Since we're fairly certain this particular homicidal maniac doesn't have the ability to telepathically murder boozing co-eds from inside his cell, the presence of a second killer is spelled out right off the bat.The film attempts to assert its intelligence via philosophical expoundings about the "neo-pagan magic" inherent in Christmas rituals, but since this conversation occurs among a group of stereotypical, bubble-headed sorority girls, these deep explorations are a definite credibility strain. Even better, the wizened lass who dispenses this profound wisdom proves herself an even more accomplished scholar five minutes later, when she talks her sorority sisters out of getting in touch with the cops after the victims-to-be receive a phone call in which a deranged man vows to kill them all. It's also important to note that this sage-like siren soon gets so drunk that she projectile vomits and passes out.As more details of Billy's back-story emerge, the film becomes even more implausible and downright icky. We eventually learn that the sorority residence is actually the house where Billy murdered his ghastly mother, and that not only have the co-eds come to terms with this brutal piece of their dwelling's history, they actually include the ostensibly institutionalized Billy in their Secret Santa gift exchange. We also get a thoroughly tasteless flashback which informs us that Billy and his mother had incestuous sex that produced an inbred daughter. Once all the facts are revealed, the whole plot is pretty much cut and dry, and Black Christmas doesn't even bother to attempt any twists, so any chance of us being surprised by the outcome of this tepid tale effectively end right there.I'm not sure if this is the product of lazy script-writing or of a misogynistic undercurrent, but despite their repeated assertions that they are sorority "sisters," the slasher-bait nymphettes in Black Christmas seem to loathe each other nearly as much as the killers do. This group of ladies call each other "b****" so often that I can honestly say I don't remember the names of any of the interchangeable characters who get sleigh-ed (ha!) along the way. Not to be outdone, the vaguely suspect boyfriend of our main heroine manages to drop the phrase "f***ing b*****s" about 8 times in one scene. I agree that "fornicating female dogs" would have been a tad wordy, but the screenwriters could of at least changed it up a bit for us.The film offers up a few nifty gore gags to keep us from falling asleep, but the killers' repeated use of holiday-themed weaponry eventually becomes so silly that it dilutes the impact of the money moments. No matter how gleefully the splatter is poured on, after watching various victims get strangled with Christmas lights, stabbed with candy canes, chopped with ice skates, gouged with conveniently pointy ornaments, and impaled with icicles, I ended up wondering who was going to get trampled by a reindeer, then found myself slightly disappointed when this never came to pass. Although, I will give the film credit for Billy's ghoulish "Christmas cookies," which can be held directly responsible for most of the stars I gave this movie.Ever since Scream so adeptly parodied the tropes of the classic slasher film, modern day splatter movies have wisely attempted to stray outside these confines. This is not the case with Black Christmas, which opts instead to take a huge leap back in time. The hapless victims here practically invite their demises, and their dumb decisions throughout make it nearly impossible to root them on. One duo meets their predictable ends when they decide that driving on snow-clogged roads through a blinding blizzard is safer than sticking with the group and waiting for help to come. Other bravo choices include climbing up into the attic to confront the killers once the survivors ascertain that's where the murderers are hiding, and the flight of one particularly hysterical gal, who eschews the neon "Exit" sign in front of her and chooses to retreat into a bedroom when being chased by one of the malevolent stalkers. Shockingly, her attempt to instead jump out of a second story window does not prove fruitful.The brazenly stupid denouement tacked on after the "final" confrontation with the killers only serves to pad the run time, and since you'll be wishing this thing was over already at that point, the conclusion to this fiasco is about as satisfying as unwrapping a pair of slipper socks.Black Christmas isn't unwatchable, but it's certainly pointless, and with decades of horror films at the discerning viewer's disposal, there's a really long list of offerings genre fans should cross off before they settle for this gimmicky and misguided dud. I don't want to over-do it with the holiday puns, but this movie practically begs for them, and when I finally made it to the end credits, the words "lump of coal" definitely came to mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not include any spoiler so that you can trust not to watch it and waste your time. Saying this, it is a huge cliché of a film so a spoiler is already known if you have seen rubbish teen slasher movies before.My girlfriend and her friends told me it was a very scary film and her friends had males watching it too, so i will say, if you are extremely easily scared then you might find this a bit scary. If you want a good scary film to watch stay away from this film.The plot is very, very weak and from the comments i have read you are better off watching the original. This film is full of obvious suspense and relies on the gore to make you scared. There are no twists or mysteries in this film to keep you guessing who might be the killer on the rampage. The acting is terrible and being set in the 21st century with all our cell phones and the internet makes this the more unrealistic.I actually ended up laughing through the film, so i would consider this more of a horror comedy rather than anything else. The part that made me laugh most was the killers catchphrase "you are my family know" done in the style of papa lazarou, if you have ever seen the British dark comedy "The league of gentlemen". Had me in stitches.Anyway, don't bother watching this as I regretted it dearly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see the original, and although people who harbor crushes for "cult classics," I know that generally if I watched the 1974 version of this movie I'd find it to be a piece of crap, so let's get over ourselves right now, shall we? Being one of 12 people who loved a cheap 70s horror flick doesn't make you special, and I don't believe that type of exclusivity is the type to generally be proud of.Regardless, this movie was okay if for the fact that not really a lot happened in it. It didn't have a cheap look to it, and there were enough familiar faces lending modest credibility to it that I didn't have many problems with it. The fact of the matter is that everything took place in a matter of a few hours, and you really don't know anything about the characters who are methodically being killed throughout the flick. That's one strike against the movie.Strike two - and I believe this to be maybe the thing that insulted me most - is that with the original ending it appears that we have an entire EMT and hospital staff that is incapable of properly diagnosing death. You'd think that would be fairly basic, yet completely alive people are put in body bags and sent to the morgue. Remember, these are not supernatural beings.Strike three - and this is one that is a glaring weakness in probably 80 percent of horror flicks - please explain to me why the hell this pair decides to kill complete strangers. As in most horror movies, revenge is usually not even a factor any longer when it comes to the current story because wrongs were righted 10 years earlier when the appropriate people were killed at THAT time. In this movie, the people who put the children through hell were killed BY one of the children, so what exactly is the beef? Billy escaped this year, so that's why the sister and he hook up and try to kill everyone in their old home? Were they just going to keep killing everyone who ever moved into the place for ... what reason, exactly? Are the new occupants sullying the wonderful childhood memories of abuse, murder, and incest Billy and Agnes have of the place? We wouldn't want that! Ultimately, this is pretty much an assembly-line killing flick with no real value beyond a couple of nice racks, but it's got enough of a quality look to it that it's worth a 5-for-$5 rental at Blockbuster. Not much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Try the cookies... They're delicious... This is a shameless remake that once again sacrifices substance for gratuitous violence and once again it fails miserably in artistic value the original contains next to no blood to achieve the shocks and most of all its point. What is it with remakes? Only occasionally do they get it right and this is definitely not one of those cases. There seems to be no point to the remake, no reason to why it should have come to be. Substance is a key in movies; this is just a shameless remake of an effective exploitation/slasher movie, without a hint of anything and I mean anything decent to save it.The scares are boring and ineffective and definitely unremarkable and the violence is laughable and there is a definite air of laziness surrounding the effects team. Not even a death scene stands out, I for one wanted this to be good, an updated version of the original would be great for this day and age in horror exploiting the innocence of Christmas all over again, or even using it as a anti-religion statement but I'm afraid I was disappointed when it came down to it. The girls are the run of the mill kind that you find in most horror movies, not one in remarkable in any way and the acting makes you wish someone like Jamie Lee Curtis and give them all lessons on how to do it the right way. The acting could be construed as a love letter to 70s and 80s horror movies but I don't think the director was that intelligent.I don't know if it is supposed to be intentionally funny but it definitely comes off that way. If viewed as a B-Movie this is a masterpiece of bad dialogue and awful effects but unfortunately so it looks like the film is taking itself seriously. Not even satire appears in this remake, how hard could it be to write a little satire? There is no analysis to be done with a film with such a lack of substance and not lack of substance in a fun and corny way, lack of substance in the worst way possible.Skip to the End1.0/10Unremarkable in every way.</fullReview>

In the movie trailer it shows a woman first being dragged over a ledge by Christmas lights and then being pulled towards the Christmas lights collector and that wasn't in the movie and also on the same trailer a girl is shown rubbing the ground perhaps looking for something and then finds a frozen body and it bursts its way out of the ice and reaches up. Both of these things were not in the film which made me extremely upset and the front cover shows a person entangled in Christmas lights too. if anybody knows where i can see this can they please send me a message. this film was very good and i cannot really decide between this one and the original one. this one reminded me of the remake of house of wax in a way. very good and i suggest you see it if you can take violent eyeball scenes.</fullReview>

But with Black Christmas, you get an unsatisfying movie that falls WAY short of its original and can't even compare to it. You'll like this movie if you just like slasher films and don't care about the plot or if you're with someone and you just want to make them jump.

		<shortDescription>Black Christmas - Great Remake of the Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Black Christmas '06" is a remake of the classic "Black Christmas" that spawned many classics. One being "Halloween". I have to say, I hate remakes. They usually are completely different from the original, different characters, different deaths, and different EVERYTHING. Though this remake surprised me. It was definitely a good film, many will disagree with me. But its my opinion and I will stand by it.The only reason that I didn't like the original "Black Christmas" was the fact that it was a "Who Dun it" type slasher. Where we don't know who is doing the strange calls and killings. Then at the end we find out he's some psycho that escaped from an Insane Asylum. Now for me, thats a horrible horrible way to end a slasher film. But the remake of "Black Christmas" explains Billy's origin, and how he escaped the Insane Asylum. So that were not disappointed at the end.The gore in this film isn't that great. There are mainly both the killers eating eyeballs, gorged out eyes, and Melissa's head missing a chunk. The rest are just splattered blood, and one girl you don't even seen blood come out of her.The characters in the film aren't that developed greatly. But its a slasher, and usually that can slide. One girl named Claire is killed in the beginning -- and there is a whole mystery revolved around her. Where is she? Is she dead? But her undeveloped death can slide since she adds in another character, and is a mystery through the film.Overall: The remake of the classic "Black Christmas" does well. There isn't that much gore, the character development isn't great, but the storyline is pretty good, the actor from the original BC pays the respect and does it well.IMDb Score: 8/10 My Score: ***/****</fullReview>

The boy had killed his mother and step father, and pulled out one of his sister's eye. The boy now, if I remember right, in his 30s or 40s, is in an insane asylum, while his sister's whereabouts are unknown. The boy escapes the nut house and comes home where he kills the girls off one by one. Let's arrange this review around to talk about the good, and the bad.Good: Basically the only good thing about this was it had some original ways for people to die.Bad: This movie was not scary, and had terrible acting, also it had very disgusting parts, such as when the boy killed his parents, he used cookie cutters to make cookies out of his parents skin, and when the police arrived them saw him eating the cookies.1 out of 5, don't rent, don't buy, don't ever.

Gory, nasty, exploitative fun.It is stupid beyond belief ("The killer's in the attic - let's go and have a look!") and the plotting is lazy (the electricity is cut to the house and a girl still manages to have a power shower - nice arse shot, though, which I suppose was the whole point of the sequence), but the girls are pretty and bouncy and director Glen Morgan has fun pointing out lots of lovely sharp objects before they are plunged in nubile, female flesh. (By the way, a guy also gets killed nastily. Equality, and all that.) There is also a whole thing about eyes...It's very short (84 minutes) so you won't waste too much of your life if you go to see it. It's not a classic, because it has all been done before, but it filled an afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this new remake of the 1974 classic, Black Christmas would hardly be decent. Well, it IS decent, but it's far from the hair raising original.My hopes got higher when I heard of the cast. I must admit that the cast is spectacular. Glen Morgan has rounded up a cast of the most beautiful and talented youth actresses in the industry. Katie Cassidy, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Crystal Lowe, Lacey Chabert, Michelle Tratchenberg, and veteran funny lady Andrea Martin(who played Phyll in the original)headline the cast.However hard they try, the competent cast can't overcome the overall silliness of the movie. The narrative lacks the terror of the original. There is no suspense and besides a few jump scares, it's virtually scareless.The deaths are ridiculously over the top. The opening goes over well, with a nice update of Clair(Leela Savasta)'s death from the original. However, as the film progresses, the deaths get dumber and dumber, climaxing in an awful finale. It really is one of the most pathetic climaxes I've seen in a long time, completely lacking thrills. The only good moment comes from a sly homage to Happy Birthday To Me, in the form of a Christmas tree surrounded by the corpses of the girls.I know a good film was in here, and apparently, I'm right. The script was re-written many times, not to mention the many re-shoots and test screenings that managed to mess the movie up royally.I'll give it points for trying and being entertaining. Some of the comedy is good too. Wait for an uncut DVD!</fullReview>

We are shown through flashbacks that are throughout the first half why Billy is the way he is and why he continues to do what he does. We also have our attractive young cast as well as a cast member from the original Black Christmas (Andrea "SCTV" Martin) playing the role of the dorm mother who all in one way or another end up being fodder for Billy and his homicidal rages.The original Black Christmas is a solid Slasher from the 70's that does a better job as a whole compared to the new movie, especially the twisted phone calls made by Billy, the new version just cannot match it in tone or bizarreness. However what it lacks in those areas in makes up for in raw carnage as this movie has some nice gore set pieces . There are some kills that if lingered on longer or shown in its entirety as oppose to just a bucket of red stuff being thrown on the ground simulating someone just got killed that would have made this an even more intense, for violence and gore sake, film.Make no mistake this film is not perfect as the story meanders in parts and only gives us side stories that go nowhere as well as a cast that you want to see die as most of them come off as preppy skanks!!! That's fine to me as no emotional attachment to the characters makes me want to see them die in a more violent way anyway. Also as in most Slashers we get the cast making stupid decisions in the least opportune times resulting, in most cases, their demise. For some the pacing will bother them as the beginning starts off well but in the middle a lot of nothing happens making way to a 20 minute free-for-all in the end that results in most of the cast dying in that short time frame.Taken in portions this film delivers for the most part as a Slasher but the average film fan will laugh this one off as a terrible movie or be too grossed out to watch the movie in its entirety. I would give this one a recommendation to Slasher fans even though this one has that modern teeny bopper feel in parts it makes up for it in its visceral kill sequences that I hope are extended on DVD. All other movie goers will want to see "Happy Feet" or some other festive movie.In closing go into this one with your Slasher hat on and nothing else and you should be mildly entertained. All others forget it: Score: 5/10: Average, A bland middle act hampers this one but fans of slasher films should find the kills are nice. Fans of Thrillers will not be amused as there is nothing thrilling here just out and out violence. All others will want to disregard this one. Here's hoping for an uncut DVD!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I think of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved I thought it was really good.I have seen a lot of horror movies!I don't usually think that remakes are very good but I seem to enjoy this film and the acting was great. I have watched the 1974 version and I liked that to. All the Christmas horror movies kinda sucked. I didn't like silent night deadly night very much but I haven't seen any of the other ones. Believe me I have seen a lot of horror movies if it wasn't for me the a small video store would be out of business. My cousin get's me movies before they are released to the general public because he works at a video store. I would recommend this movie to any horror film fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no conceptual thought process with a film like 'Black Christmas', but I'll be damned if I said the creators of 'Final Destination' didn't know how to make a stylish and entertaining picture. Despite its nice holiday set-up, the film is bogged down by its many clichés and plot holes. And while it's not scary in the least, the film gets points for offing characters in creative, and quite funny, ways. Another throw-away slasher, but one that'll keep your attention and may leave you somewhat satisfied.It's Christmastime, and a group of sorority sisters are celebrating the best way they know how, bickering and exchanging Secret Santa gifts. And every year, there's one present under the tree addressed to Billy, the reason why their house is now a legend. For fifteen years ago, Billy, who was abused by his mother and locked up in the attic, brutally murdered his mother and her boyfriend while sparing his sister... who also happens to be his daughter. It all happened here in the house the girls now stay in, and this year, Billy is coming home for the holidays. Home to his childhood house. Suddenly, the girls begin to receive a series of frightening and threatening phone calls from a mysterious caller that appears to be inside the house. Now, stranded in the middle of a winter storm, Alpha Kappa will begin to lose its members one by one in the grimmest ways possible.Written, produced, and directed by Glen Morgan, 'Black Christmas' is lucky it has style, because its villain is the antithesis of scary. And though there are some disturbing scenes, contained mainly in the film's flashbacks of Billy's upbringing, there's nothing in this film that would qualify as scary. You see one slasher, you've seen them all. Instead, 'Christmas' works on many of the same levels as the 'Final Destination' films, in the way they act as little more than elaborate death scenes one after the other. And hell, this may indeed be the goriest Christmas flick ever made, and that'll sure please the horror junkies. When all else fails, pile on the blood. Even when your film bends the rules of reality with gaping plot holes, a few buckets of blood will set things right. Right? The film's acting is what you'd expect, to be honest. A few talented actresses with a poor script to work with, but require less than the bulb that lights the scene. It is, however, nice to see Lacey Chabert back in action after lying low after her breakout performance in 'Mean Girls'. A fantastic actress, she just needs to find a script to suit her talent. The rest of the cast features many horror film vixens, including Katie Cassidy ('When A Stranger Calls'), Mary Elizabeth Winstead ('Final Destination 3'), Kristen Clock ('Final Destination'), Crystal Lowe ('Final Destination 3')and Andrea Martin, who starred in the original 1974 'Black Christmas'. Chabert and Michelle Trachtenberg are the lone horror virgins, but something tells me that won't last.If you're sick of the saccharine Christmas movies, and looking for something a bit more sac religious, 'Black Christmas' is a fairly safe bet. It's not a good movie by any standards, but acts as a nice diversion before you get back to your busy life. Just be aware of what you're getting yourself into, as you're not likely to find an ounce of originality in Morgan's latest fright(less) fest. If you're a fan of bad horror films, sit back and enjoy the ride. If not, stay away. Otherwise, you may lose your appetite for Christmas cookies.Review by Burtonesque, written for www.boxofficefanatic.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as i thought....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*minor spoilers*OK,so i went to this with really high hopes and i have been looking forward to it for about 6 months... This movie starts out with a bang and the first 50-55 minutes are good. One of the complaints i have is how fast all the death scenes where and how repetitive they where. And also the fact that 5 of the death scenes where off camera. So anyways as i said i went to this movie with high hopes and i was actually very disappointed, the climax was boring and it wasn't really scary at all. The acting was OK but had GREAT one-liners from Lacey Chabert and Crystal Lowe.and to make things worse the sound at my theater cut off for like the last 6 minutes...so all in all i give this movie a 6 for the first 50-55 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, the director claims he's humiliated by the final product and Bob Weinstein's interference and it barely makes a lick of sense, but this is one of my guiltiest of guilty pleasures. I wouldn't recommend this film for the life of me and its very existence is barely acceptable, but it's well shot, has a cast of beautiful ladies and is wonderfully misanthropic. As with his other remake Willard, Glen Morgan has a good eye for visuals and the demented. For a slasher film, there's barely a moment of down time. We trade in character development for one eyeball being gouged out after the next. My favorite Christmas film and a good anti-holiday time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy was abused by his mother as a child. While his mother was cheating on Billy's father, she eventually killed his father and kept Billy in the attic - for good, while she was with her lover and starting a "new" family. As Billy's mother fell pregnant with a daughter and treated her with love, which Billy had never experienced with his mother, Billy came out of the attic after years and brutally murdered his mother and her lover. Cut to present day, a group of eight sorority sisters and their house mother, who now live in Billy's childhood home, find themselves being harassed by threatening and intimidating mystery phone-calls during Christmas Break and as one of the girls goes missing, the girls begin being murdered one by one by no other than Billy...One thing is for sure about this, it's miles better than the original, as that was one horrid, boring little movie.But then when you look at this movie, it's just another excuse for a remake to make a quick dollar, and it's nothing new or fresh, but with the added twist of Christmas, I'll be a lot less harsh this time.The main problem with the film is the gore. It's way too over the top and doesn't really fit with the rest of the film, and it was probably put in to make it stand with Hostel et al, as this was 2006 and we were going through the gorenography part of cinema life.Acting is okay, the first ten minutes are actually quite good, but when we are placed in the main setting, it becomes annoying as the girls are all your usual snobby sorts who you wouldn't give the time of day to any other time.Billy is okay, but the over use of his eye gets a tad boring, and hey! We get a little twist at the end.If you've nothing better to do before Christmas, and it's cold and dark, this might suffice, otherwise, it's just another mundane horror...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glen Morgan and James Wong gained notoriety by writing a few good episodes of the 90's TV sensation "The X-Files." Their later collaborative efforts on the show (notably, the episode "Kin") were not up to the same standards as their earlier work, but they soldiered on, running the show into the ground. Flash-forward to the the first decade in the 21st century and horror movie remakes have become an easy way for a studio to turn a buck. The Christmas holiday is a well-known "money" weekend for movies; people are stuck with little to do and often go see movies to relieve the boredom. Put "those guys who did stuff on X-Files" on a remake of a horror movie that is set during Christmas and release it on Christmas Eve....how could it go wrong, right? Well, it did go wrong and it pulls the X-Files legacy down with it.Morgan and Wong produced this mess and Morgan "wrote" the script and directed the movie, which is just sad. Fans of the X-Files will notice a similar feel in certain scenes, but any similarity ends at the visual level as this movie is a poorly executed mess. You will also notice several homages to the X-Files: the yellow-skinned antagonist being one, the obsession with eye injury being another and finally, the in-breeding. What is it with Morgan and Wong and inbreeding? Regardless, "Black Christmas" is an ugly, boring mess that grinds on inexorably to its conclusion. It's a shame that a cast filled with talented, gorgeous young women like Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachentenberg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead have no better lines than "F___ Christmas!" and "Christmas sucks!" but I guess that's what happens when a movie is churned out by two guys who hit their stride with "Jose Chung's from Outer Space" and that was....what? 1997?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really enjoy this film. Maby its because im a big horror fan and im just comparing this to a lot of classic horror films in my horror movie collection ?! but this film really got to me in a bad way. I didn't really like the way the film was done, even though it did have a story line at the same time it felt like it didn't (if that makes sense?). Clair the first victim in the house has a half sister that later comes into the equation. she has came to see her sister annoyed that shes driven all that way and Clair isn't even there ! The thing that real got to me in this part was how with out building a relationship with the other girls and not letting you have the chance to get to know her she almost becomes the hero. which you are probably thinking at the moment "what the hell this guy doesn't know what hes on about, he just doesn't make sense". well if you are saying/thinking that then i understand you because its hard to explain. it It was just the way the film was done in a whole. A Black Christmas just didn't say much to me as a horror film as it should of done. Im not complaining about the goer because if u like fingers penetrating eyes then this is you type of film ! staying on the subject of fingers penetrating eyes, I thought it was ridiculous how he would get the eyeballs and eat them, I mean come on whats that all about. OK its not the thing about them thinking about it its just how it was done it just looked so unreal, not the eyeballs them self's but just the way it was done. I guess it was kind of random in way ! I also didn't like the ending (for people that have seen this film I don't want to make it a spoiler so i wont say any this, but this film it already spoiled :P In conclusion I believe this film "A black Christmas was a film that people tat aren't really into horror film or say they are but don't know any ting about them, this would be a good film for them. but on the other hand people that truly call them self horror fans, THIS IS DEFENATLY NOT A FILM FOR YOU !!! I would also like to add that this is a remake of a 1974 film directed by Bob Clark !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgettable and poorly written slasher remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the last day before winter break, a sorority house comes under attack by a pair of mysterious assailants with a strange obsession for plastic bags and eye gouging.What's there to say about this disappointing stinker that hasn't been said a hundred times before. Even without comparing it to the original, it's bad. Other than a select few elements, there's not much good to say about this flick. Those few good elements would be. . . well. . . few and far between, to say the least. For one, the soundtrack was good, but it's hard to ruin Christmas carols. Also, the cast is extremely lot. Lacey Chabert, Michelle Trachtenberg, Katie Cassidy, etc., all look very fine indeed. And, I suppose the last positive would be some okay gore (especially the cookie-eating scene). From there on, it's all pretty bad. The writing is absolutely atrocious with almost every little detail and secret being explained more than the plan of a Bond villain. The change of Billy to some kind of liver-diseased weirdo was a big mistake. On two other technical notes, the acting is pretty bad, but not completely horrible; and, the direction is fairly mediocre, as it doesn't look TOO bad, but is certainly nothing to brag about. A truly annoying problem I had with the film was the lack of differentiation between the characters. Sure, you had some basic personalities (the drunk, the partygirl, the Christian, the weirdo), but they all kinda blend together and really have no true separation. I'm not sure if I even remember any of their names (except Eve, and that's only because I like the name). In the end, Black Christmas is a subpar, poorly made, and ultimately forgettable slasher that can easily be dismissed for the original (or anything else).Obligatory Christmas-Horror Elements:- Subgenre: Slasher- Christmas Carols: One of the few good things about the film: The holiday soundtrack.- Snow: Yeah, and icicles play a bit of a role.- Person in a Santa suit: People randomly show up in Santa outfits. . . not used very well though.- Violence/Gore: The deaths are repetitive to start, then over-the-top-stupid for the rest of the time. Lots of eye gouging and plastic bags.- Sex/Nudity: Not nearly enough to save the film. You get a bit of nudity and an occasional unsatisfying sex scene, but that's all.- Scares/Suspense: None. It tries, but fails completely.- Mystery: Again, it tries, but fails.- - -Final verdict: 3/10. Pass! -AP3-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually, far more exciting than the 1974 original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long time since I've been totally thrilled by a remake (the last one was "Dawn of the Dead"). I didn't expect much of another rehash of a so-called 1970s "classic", but -I don't know exactly why- I was curious about this one. Not precisely because I looooved so much the Bob Clark's first version. On the contrary, I estimated it had not exploited its potential to its limits. In fact, as I watched it, I even had this uncomfortable feeling of witnessing a disorderly made blueprint of Carpenter's "Halloween". Which made it interesting enough at the time, though. But quite unsatisfying... Here, in the 2006 version, I did not even have the time to think too much about what I had to expect or not. The film just made the deal right away. I particularly love the way the script did not care much in making its female characters too cute. In fact, most of the girls are actually plain bitches. Which made them the more lovable to me, surprisingly enough. Secondly, the killer character's background is told in a series of flashbacks included quite smoothly into the whole storytelling. The different elements are given in a very skillful way. No heavy-handed explanation as we had to get along with in the dreadful Rob Zombie's Halloween. Then, the plot itself grows suspenseful each minutes in a excellently orchestrated crescendo. Not a minute, the viewer feels cheated by twists and turns overblown or artificial. On top of that, the film is filled with original ideas to surprise the audience and play with its expectation. A very intelligent film made out of a tired ingredients (the killer chasing girls again and again), I simply loved its sarcastic tone, its terrifying use of innocent Christmas musics, its own score, the atmosphere, its fast pace, its sharp dialogs... everything. What can I say? I loved it, and yet I consider myself a very difficult moviegoer.For those who would want to know if i share the same values, here is the list of remakes I simply hated: Rob Zombie's Halloween, Amityville, The Fog, When a Stranger Calls, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, ... in fact almost all of them. Except "Dawn of the Dead" and, of course, "Black Christmas"!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie Black Christmas was a remake of another movie from the 1970's of the same title. Boy, let me tell you this movie certainly did not live up to the original. This movie lacked originality and was a complete gore fest from start to finish. The characters were never fully developed so you do not care what happens to them. The original had a gripping, suspenseful plot whereas this was quite predictable and as with most horror movies the killers seemed to live through everything. The main killer was born with kidney or liver condition so he was a yellowish/green color which made him look like the Incredible Hulk. I would say don't waste your time especially if you have seen the original this will be a real let down as it was for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picture this. It's Xmas. I'm up early. i take the bus to AMC just to see the Black Christmas remake, which is oddly labeled Black Xmax on my ticket stub. I was aware this movie would be lame but alas i do own House of Wax (remake), When a Stranger Calls (remake), and Texas Chainsaw Massacre (remake). So i figured this movie had a decent chance of being good enough.With this said, wow did this movie stink. I have never been so ticked off with a remake before. I loved the original Black Christmas and tried to not take this one so closely due to it being a remake. But it tries to be BOTH a remake and a sequel. The thing that made the original so great was that the background of the killer was a mystery. So the real focus was the story at hand. This version's focus was the killer Billy's background. So you're having the killer explained (with a decent but lame origin that touched on psycho IV) plus a half-A story of sorority girls being stalked and killed.The characters were bland b movie types. Not even the lead character had much character. Not to say the cast wasn't good, because i felt that was the only real good thing about this movie. But, hey had nothing to really work with.The murders were...well, i kept asking myself "wait wasn't this rated R?". If u watch the first 10 minutes u'll get what i mean (4 deaths). I mean how many times can u see a Gray bag shoved over a face and blood splatters and eye attacks before u want to commit the act to yourself? At least in the original the bag was clear and was done and used properly throughout the entire film. Also let me get this out of the way. The killer's look was for crap. House of Wax and Cherry Falls worked the whole hair thing. What was this movie's excuse? As for the ending? It REALLy reminded me of the "House of Wax" ending only it truly fell short to even that. It tries to pull a twist that apparently the filmmakers felt the audience was too stupid to figure out within the first 15 minutes. I myself tried to give the movie more credibility by assuming a similar but much more complicated ending. Showed me.Glen Morgan what can i tell u besides u ruined a perfectly good chance to continue Black Christmas. The remake is so new it'll be a while until they can do either a REAL sequel to Black Christmas or a at least DECENT remake. Sadly the next movie out will be a sequel to this suck fest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Was Definitely A Black Christmas!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to congratulate the producers from making this excellent and chilling movie. It was executed in a fantastic horror-way and highly recommend the world to watch this movie. The reasons why I loved this movie was: 1. The setting is Christmas 2. The setting of the house really looked like it was in the spirit of Christmas because of all the lights and decorations. 3. Excellent choice of cast,including bringing back Margot Kidder who starred in the original movie. 4. The deaths were gruesome. 5. The killers were provided an alibi to kill the sorority girls Although I gave this EXCELLENT movie a 10/10, there could've and should've been some changes in the film which let it down.I hated how people made rash comments about this movie, I think they were being TOO picky.Firstly the gaps between deaths are a bit too quick, like after Heather and Mrs Mac dies, Melissa dies straight after, THEN Lauren dies immediately after as well. That's the thing with horror movie, it can get a little bit cliché' when you start killing too many people off in a short frame of time. Like for example as I said, four people died in approximately five to six minutes. I suggest the writers should've added more dialog between the girls and keep the scenes longer between each death. Not just move onto the next death as it like Friday the 13th. They should add more terror and predictable scenes which you think something will happen but it doesn't.The back story was clever, however it was too long, they needed to cut the scenes down to a good five minutes quickly showing the history of Billy Lenz. Because I didn't rent Black Christmas to watch his history, I rented it to watch the actual movie and the main setting. But that was fine...The thing with Eve I didn't quite understand. How come the producers made the audience think that Eve was actually the long lost (sister) daughter of Billy. Agnes Lenz. There was pretty much no sense in doing that. However doing so, it would have made the movie was enjoyable, mysterious and interesting.Another problem I had was Mrs Mac's death,an icicle doesn't just fall straight into your eye that hard. I though Billy was supposed to kill her. I'm fine with the death event of Mrs Mac, but it would've been better if Billy got out of the car and walked to Mrs Mac who says to Billy, "It's really you Billy!". Then Billy plucks the icicle above Mrs Mac's head and shoves it through her eye. That would've have executed the death much better. So far, Black Christmas is favourite movie EVER and I am planning to create a tradition when I will watch Black Christmas EVERY year on Christmas!!! 10+/10</fullReview>

About 85% of the film, I was laughing at how stupid this crapfest was. The acting was one-dimensional, the script was predictable, and some of the killings were the dumbest i have ever seen in a slasher film. Also, the scares in the original were replaced with blood and guts, and the actresses in this version, including Lacey Chabert, Michelle Trachtenberg, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, are much better then this movie. In the original, the acting was very strong, and the story was very heavy on suspense. Bottom line: Instead of watching this abomination, check out the original instead, that one is much scarier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excuse for my exaggerated reaction, but this movie is such a garbage. First, the script. Might be good, well, back in 80s, or better, in 1974, few yrs before Halloween? now this remake is turning it into such a brutal, primitive and stupid mixture of Hollywood cliché, that i had to ask myself for dozen times when watching it: Is that even possible to make? Second - The characters are so imbecile, flat and you really cannot empathize with any of them. I just felt sorry for one chick as she got killed. The acting is terrible, too. I could have it acted better, believe me, and Im not into such of stuff actually. It went so bad, that 30 minutes before the end of this "movie", i wasn't able to keep on watching it. The story is totally predictable. Hm, what a surprise. Another point - the gore. Good God, so gross. The principle of not just American, but of directors of other regions, too - when you aren't able to make a decent horror, give it so much gore as you can, at least the poor people who will watch it, will get hm, something of it. Eating of eyeballs, honestly, this is too much. Worse than Hostel. But to say, the worst i can think of, is the idiotic script. The psycho looking from the cellar up to the bathroom. You people have the floor made of 2cm hardened concrete...or?? such goofs i have never seen yet. but never mind, everyone has got his own taste. Its up to you, if I like to spend hour and a half of watching pure imbecility, horrible acting, stupidity, nonsense massacre and so on. Maybe you'll find in that movie something deeper i didn't. But by now, I've seen a plenty of movies, horrors, thrillers and I've seen them on dozens. Anyways, from my angle of view, ill give it two points of ten. See it for yourself, you'll give it 8 maybe. Well, bye :P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch out, the yellow guy is behind you!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I will try to make this as short as possible. I could really write a whole essay on how bad this movie really is, but of course, I don't have the patience to do so right now. At the beginning, the movie starts off with a girl wrapping a present, all of a sudden she gets killed... by a yellow guy!!!. OK, so let me describe how he kills his victims. He puts a garbage bag over their heads a rips their eyeballs out... thats it. There is no decapitation scenes or anything like that. If anything you might see a head but you don't really see the act. There are other killings that don't involve a garbage bag but they are not worth mentioning. You might think that ripping someones eyeballs out might look disgusting, but when you see movies like "Return to house on hunted hill", ripping someones eyeballs out just seems like childsplay. OK, so I will try to be a bit soft on the ending. It gave me a feeling of pride to live in the US. But why do you say this? because the UK version is just plain rubbish. To summarize this, if you want to see gore, go watch something else, even final destination has better death scenes than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the age of horror films has come and gone. heres the proof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the biggest insult to a classic horror film i've ever seen, next to Gus Van Sant's remake of PSYCHO. Black Christmas is one of my favorite horror films. And when i heard it was going to be remade, i knew that this would give the original a bad name. in the original, there were only six or seven deaths. in the remake, i lost track. almost every death showed eyes getting ripped out, and after the 8 millionth victim gets her head ripped off, it starts t get so dull and predictable. everything was so gory, it was like the film depended on gore more than the actual plot. don't even get me started on the plot. in the original, we never see who the killer is, why he's killing people or what connection he has with the sorority group. in the remake, we're given a back story about how he became a psychopath obsessed with ripping people's eyes out, which just takes away all the mystery and suspense. How could Glen Morgan do this? He actually wrote the script too! Does this guy have problems or something? because only a totally deranged maniac could think of something like this, and/or find it entertaining. I'm not the only one who's saying this. as most people have heard, when the movie came out on Christmas day, it was a box-office flop, Christian groups were offended, horror fans were offended, and i'm offended, because glen Morgan took the original slasher film and turned it into a piece of sh**. forget coal, Santa should start putting the DVD of this movie in people's stockings if they've been naughty! 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another remake Hollywood has managed to be bastardize to the point of nausea. Yes, I feel so passionately opposed to this film that I felt compelled to write another review, warning my fellow citizens not to invest in this tripe.So how did Hollywood manage to mess up one of the most chilling, influential and cryptic horrors of the seventies? By doing a big poo all over the script, giving Billy a back-story, choosing actors from the Disney club, not giving any of them distinguishable personalities, turning the killer(s) into a one dimensional zombie, unrealistic deaths, laughable special effects, no ambiguity, pointless gore, no twist, awful dialogue, weak plot... I really could write an essay on how bad this film is. Please avoid this pantomime crap-fest and rent or buy the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hands down the winner in the "lets remake a 1970's horror film sweepstakes" that ran all 2006. The plot has a group of sorority sisters terrorized by a mad man at Christmas time. Ghoulish, gross, grotesque and nasty in all the right ways this is one of the best attempts at remaking an old horror film. If the movie suffers its in the casting of the girls who are fine in their performances, but who never over come the clichés they are playing. I didn't much care for them, which is ashame since the film has some really good horror gross out scenes. Not for the squeamish or those grossed out by eyeballs. Worth a look for horror fans on video and cable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another one from a studio that has pumped out more garbage in the last few years than any other studio in recent memory. Like the Halloween remake we get a lot of back story as to why this person kills. Loosely based around the original story and plot line.Excessive gore and atmosphere sink this one. I like the original because it weaves a chilling story. This is really just uses the title and is less of a remake. The studio put a lot of money behind the ad campaign and should of put it into making this a better movie. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. No good leading stars or a worthwhile soundtrack. This movie is a train wreck. Seeing is Believing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sorry but I am one those types of people that brings logic to their opinions. Mainly there wasn't any positives about this movie and from observing this film I can't watch anymore horror films. It's the same cliché thing after another. Spoiler: The only thing that was good in this film was... the monster ripping the victim's eyes from their sockets. Nasty? Not really! So here the story starts, from what I remember are these girls boarding in this house where this retarded killer (with a weird name) is hiding in the attic where he torments the girls. And oh yes, many people are doing stupid stuff like splitting up or some other people are at the wrong place at the wrong time and they can't escape... yada, yada! And oh yes, who could forget the O'almighty jock that shows that he's a badass and acts cool in front of the girls. And yes... he gets killed. So there's only one survivor and I just don't want to remember this sh**! Well you got it! This movie ruined my enjoyment for horror films but unfortunately many horror films in this decade is going downhill. Well I hope you believe in my opinion and don't watch it! I'd warned... you.</fullReview>

The gore is really great, its the only thing that was done well, they really didn't hold back at all, then again I watched the unrated version.Other than that this is an incredibly stupid movie that has all been done before. The cast is comprised of vapid dumb sluts who do things like hit the killer once with a weapon, then drop that weapon and turn and run. And of course the killer can kill with ease but cannot be killed no matter what. I've never seen the original - but I'm sure it was at least 1000% better than this crap.</fullReview>

I cant imagine this movie being meant to be taken seriously as a real horror film. It almost seems like its intentionally bad, either that or it was written over a weekend. Basically its about a bunch of sorority sisters trapped in a house over Christmas, that they easily could have escaped from by walking to the neighbors house, and they are being killed by a guy who was molested as a child and has an obsession with eyeballs, oh, and he also has yellow skin, which is why everyone always hated him.

It was even better than the original, it was my favorite movie of 2006. It was awesome, it had a hot cast. The killer was creepy, and the death scenes were cool! I cannot wait for the unrated DVD (April 3) which includes 5 extra minutes, seven deleted scenes, and alternate ending! This movie, no matter what everyone else says, this movie is definitely worth a look! it will scare you and it will make you laugh!! The director also directed Final Destination 3 (another great horror flick) but this one for some reason just made me love it, i guess it was unique. Give it a look!

		<fullReview>I love big blockbuster horror movies for no other reason that that of the usual poor acting, weak plots, and the excruciating pain it takes to sit through each film. So Black Christmas was a must see. And it lived up to all those expectations. Michelle Trachtenberg played Melissa in the movie. Trachtenberg has been in many shows and movies such as Pete &amp; Pete and Harriet the Spy. Not even Harriet could figure out how this movie made it into production. This movie had as much to do with Christmas as Seal has to do with modeling for the Gap. Seal with a Puppy would make me throw up on a sweater, let alone buy one. I say Seal sticks with comparing girls to being kissed from a rose on the "grey". I always thought it was "Grave", but whatever, it really makes no sense either way. But this isn't about Seal, its about the art of cinema. Towards the end the movie, it became so ridiculous that I started thinking of names to call my beagle when I'm 30. I would go into a zen like focus coming up with great ones like Max, Sam, and Bartalby. But then I was interrupted by pointless murders that just wouldn't be physically possible even if both Hulks; The Incredible one and Hogan, were inflicting that type of pain. If by some strange reason you are forced to watch this movie, simply fake a death. I find heart-attack and gun shot wound to work the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine holiday slasher film, just don't expect it to be too serious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas is a fine holiday slasher movie that isn't as bad as it's reputation on here. The film is about Billy Lenz, who escapes from the mental institution on Christmas eve and goes back to his childhood home, which is now a sorority house. From there, he begins to kill the girls one by one. While this movie if pretty formulaic and not nearly as suspenseful or unsettling as the 1974 version, this remake provides some great entertainment. It's got some good things going for it - the story is different from the original and has a nice spin on it, there is plenty of scary moments, lots of violence and gore, and even some comedy too. The bottom line is, Black Christmas is a movie you can't take seriously. If you do, you'll hate it. Just take it for what it is, and don't judge it too harshly just because it's a remake. It's all in all a fun slasher movie that is worth the time.</fullReview>

I was really happy to see Crystal Lowe have a main role, she will go places.To sum it up Black Christmas is a gory movie which you will all love, starring Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachtenberg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and a lot more.You'll be screaming for more. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So what did i think of this film leading up to the festive season...Well after mixed reviews, my closest friend went with someone she new before i was planning on seeing it. Her report...its "poo".Still eager and not letting this lovely descriptive comment put me off i went and saw it. And, weather this is good or bad...I still remember it.It wasn't just me who laughed from the offset at various scenes, which is good as the film doesn't take itself to seriously. My friend thought it was a dark film....so there you go.Yes indeed, the spirit and style is shouting out that its Christmas, and there are various references to other "horror" films in that genre. yet it still manages to remain "unique" Plus points - For the first half of the film, you laugh and enjoy what is setting out to be a fun filled film about a manic.After the first half is over though, its a different story. The film comes to repetitive and predictable. Everything happens by coincidence and you will just end up laughing at the film, not with it.However, what i didn't understand was the totally random characters who would appear out of no where. Also the lack of depth (although this may have been intensional) was beyond believe with virtually no idea about the characters other than they were all related. The shoddy camera work which, for no reason decides to stick at various angles.If seeing blood splatterd around is your star on your tree, then this film is for you. However i generally cant recommend this film.Friad this is one for the cult classics - its so bad its good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BLACK Christmas (Glen Morgan, 2006) BOMB</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an admirer of the 1974 original, so it was out of mere curiosity that I decided to check out this remake. Several classic shockers of the 1970s have been revamped of late ? I've watched THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (2003) and, most recently, HALLOWEEN (2007); those two were nowhere near as good as the earlier films, but each had its points of interest. The same, however, cannot be said about the second version of BLACK Christmas. It is, easily, one of the worst films of its kind that I've come across; by changing a lot of the structure of the original, with it go a good many of its strong points ? and the end result is hardly recognizable, let alone necessary: in short, a real travesty!Perhaps the greatest coup of Bob Clark's original film was that we knew very little about the killer; in fact, we don't even get to see him except for his peering eyes. Here, on the other hand, everything is clumsily spelt out: from Billy's backstory involving a typically miserable childhood to the revelation of having two maniacs ? the other being Agnes, a character only fleetingly mentioned in the earlier film (the script, in fact, seems to have been concocted after one too many viewings of both HALLOWEEN [1978; which, ironically, was initially conceived as a sequel to the original BLACK Christmas] and CHINATOWN [1974]!). Also, one of the most disquieting elements about the earlier film ? the obscene phone calls ? are not only downplayed here but have been replaced with the dim-witted repetition of the line "She's my family now".Besides, the Police ? represented in the original by John Saxon ? or the character played in it by Keir Dullea, boyfriend of the female lead (the setting is a sorority house) and who is suspected of being behind the crime spree, barely register here. In the same vein, the girls themselves remain an anonymous bunch (as opposed to, say, Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder from the 1974 film) ? which doesn't help audience identification any. Incidentally, Andrea Martin ? who played one of the victims in the original BLACK Christmas ? appears here as the house mother (whereas Bob Clark himself figured among the remake's myriad producers!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge horror film fanatic. I saw this movie on PPV and spent about $5 on it, and do I ever want that money back! The movie failed to even make my 5-year-old sister scared, it was like a comedy with no plot that made you laugh a couple of times.There were some gross scenes, like when the mother had sex with her son just to have a child!?!?! I mean WTF right? The killer (Billy) had some weird obsession with ripping his victims eyes out...wow another psycho movie that sucks... and he likes to eat human flesh apparently.The plot was built on the stupidity of the victims... for example, Ms.Mac suggests that they leave the building and go to safety... the other dumb broads say "Oh no, we have to stay here...people are getting killed and we have to stay here to find out what's happening!!" Some of the deaths were far-fetched including the Mrs.Mac's where she gets hit with an icicle. I mean, that wouldn't be enough to kill someone. The very beginning had an idiot cop who looked inside Billy's cell and saw that he wasn't sitting in his chair...well you don't go inside the cell you stupid idiot!! One thing I didn't get was why the hell the killers were so dead set on killing these random, stupid people...I mean, just because your mother was a psychopath doesn't mean you have to kill everyone you see, and everything just went so conveniently for him.And dear god, that snow was obviously fake...they were standing outside in a blizzard, and you couldn't even see their breath! Ususally when it's freezing, you can see your breath. And what the hell was with the main breaker being under the house? Most normal people have their main breakers inside the house...and most people have their doors locked so no psychopath idiot losers can get inside.One more thing, one of the last scenes, when Agnes is stabbed in the eye with a fork...THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO KILL SOMEONE!!! OR AT LEAST MAKE THEM BLEED SO MUCH THAT THEY CANNOT ATTACK YOU ANYMORE!!! There, I got my beef out, whoever the hell it was who made this movie should go die in a hole...this was a piece of crap and a waste of time...I want to give it a negative vote...I can't believe it's rank is higher than a 1!! People must like the dumb plots and all that junk...</fullReview>

I suppose that question is a bit rhetorical when asked concerning a 2006 remake of Black Christmas. The script for this film makes little sense. Too many plot holes and too much shallow development will leave you laughing out loud at this poorly executed remake. The acting is terrible, cheesy even. It left me wondering to what degree the film was trying to be funny. Black Christmas would have benefited from taking itself in one direction, horror or comedy, but it ends up being neither. And what kind of R rated horror movie dealing with young female adults has no frontal nudity? Even more upsetting is the murderer and his "motivation", which will surely leave you craving. Don't we all have some sort of primal urge to stalk and murder sorority girls? Well you'll have to visit your local college campus for that, because Black Christmas just doesn't deliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, the popular concept of remaking classic horror milestones is not exactly the best cinema-trend in history and the attempts more than often result in dreadful movies. But are some of the nowadays directors, like Glen Morgan, really so frustrated about their own lack of talent that they deliberately want to damage the good reputation of an entire genre and its acclaimed classics? "Black Christmas 2006" is a tremendous insult to "Black Christmas 1974", particularly because that latter was such an influential and important film. The new version is wildly over-the-top and extremely incoherent in the scripting department, the film hangs together by sickening &amp; gory set pieces, the acting performances are embarrassing and every effort to bring depth or build up tension either makes no sense or goes nowhere. The plot is no longer a compelling whodunit, but a rudimentary and utterly brainless stalk-and-slash turkey. On Christmas evening, a frat house full of whiny &amp; spoiled girl students becomes the target of escaped raving lunatic killer Billy Lenz. For you see, this was the house where Billy's battle-axe mother killed his beloved father, locked him up in the attic for years and even raped him. Every year around Christmas Billy threatens to get home for the holidays, but this year he's dead serious and the girls will physically experience this. I think we've established that "Black Christmas 2006" is an phenomenally retarded film and that every die-hard fan of the original should avoid it in order to avoid a nervous breakdown, but does this updated version has absolutely nothing to offer then? Well yes actually, it features a lot (and I do mean A LOT) of gory massacres and filthy make-up effects. I didn't even think it was possible, but this film almost exaggerates in being sick-spirited, exploitative and gratuitously sadistic. Billy Lenz seemingly has an awkward fascination for gaging out people's eyeballs and every act of torture is shown in great detail. So, if you have an incontrollable passion for watching screaming &amp; helpless young girls getting mutilated, this is your movie. Then there's also the oddest incestuous sub plot I ever beheld, the inevitably clichéd reasons for characters not being able to use their mobile phones and the absence of a strong lead character. The strangest thing of all remains that Bob Clark, director of the fabulous original, actually produced this dud! Not a bad word about Clark, also because he passed away earlier this year, but why would he contribute to a travesty that desperately imitates his own work? Another weird detail is that Glen Morgan was already responsible for the remake "Willard", and that actually is a pleasingly grim and atmosphere-driven film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So a poor built remake of an Original from the late '70s, Black Christmas. Horror movies are quite easy to pass by as scary killing machines when the death sequences occur the same as the last and carry multiple victims and multiple killers. Maybe it's just me but I can't stand horror movies with dumb victims who can't attempt to save themselves or know their surroundings. Finding the horror genre to be a favorite it's terrible that this film could even carry that title for it's genre. Old people are nuts and new people die, then why did they bother recreating such a boring film. With two killers, at least one could have done different acts of killings or not be involved in the plot at all. Hence the catch, the more the merrier. I'm just old fashion, new/present day horror has no style and no new limits and boundaries to reach, instead they're taking bits and pieces from past masters of horror and suspense. This film seems like the stolen identity of the original film called "Black Christmas", oh how original, as well as a sad combination of plot/characters and conclusion of "I Know What You Did Last Summer" for the continuous murdering of friends and cheesy murder sequences, and the stalking and for "Halloween" a nut-job gets locked up and time passes by when he escapes and relives his previous murder as a life style. So please be original People! I thought "I Know What You Did Last Summer" was different, not cutting edge for it's time, but still more original than this piece of junk remake, and "Halloween" is more of the old-school originals, but hey John Carpenter borrowed from Hitchcock's "Psycho", and again more original and suspenseful then this laughter of boring crap also known as "Black Christmas"(2006).</fullReview>

I've seen the original BC and even though I don't consider it a masterpiece (I enjoyed Halloween, a movie rumored to be heavily influenced by BC, much better) it was certainly a superior horror movie.This version of BC I coudln't tell was a horror-comedy or straight up slasher. It lacked basic intelligence, good acting, wonderful script. I was so insulted by what I saw on the screen that I demanded my money back.I can tell that the Final Destination producers had a hand in this version b/c nothing was taken seriously. I was so bored that I didn't care if the main characters did die. Not only did this movie not horrify me but it couldn't even entertain me.

		<shortDescription>Worst. Remake. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surely no one sets out to make a bad movie. But in the case of the Black Christmas remake, it's hard to imagine writer/director Glen Morgan honestly thinking that this was the best he could do. The original Black Christmas is a classic, a forerunner to the modern slasher movie - stylish and eery and unsettling. But most importantly, simple and straight forward. A slasher and a murder mystery, deftly directed by Bob Clark. The remake (WHY!?) is, to be blunt, absolutely dreadful. From the first frame to the pitiful end, Black Christmas (2006) puts its viewer through the ringer, from the absurd and outlandish to the just plain dull and stupid. Giving the killer an elaborate (and ridiculous) backstory is beside the point, meaningless, mere filler. We get lame attempts at humor and gross out moments that are bad camp. The inclusion of Billy's sister, Agnes, is so out-of-left-field that it feels like Morgan was simply trying to throw in a few extra kills and pad out the movie's already spare running time. The movie isn't even 90 minutes, but you feel every second, particularly with the completely unnecessary hospital finale dragging things out to an asinine, but blessed close. Fans of the original Black Christmas should feel insulted. Horror fans should feel taken advantage of. The human race as a whole should shudder knowing this slag of trash came from one of its own. We can only hope this movie will end the careers of all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I BEG every serious moviegoer out there, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don't waste $$ on this movie! Be smart. I knew by the previews it was going to be one horrible piece of repugnant filth, the ONLY reason being for me going to see it is it was a 1st date with this girl I had met and she was into "scary movies" (which in reality it isn't even that)! I have NEVER seen a movie so filled with clichés of 80's slasher films. This film would have done better as a "spoof" on movies like Friday the 13th, Halloween and the such. Instead, b/c it's TRYING to bee a serious horror flick, it makes 80's horror icons like Jason Voorhies and Mike Myers look like golden luminaries of the Horror genre (which, of course, they aren't)...You would do well to save the few bucks it costs to see this crap and purchase chewable dog bones and ex-lax from your closest grocery store, take them home, eat them both and have yourself a nice "push" in the bathroom and DON'T FLUSH... why? I just want you to get a good "sense" of what it feels like to actually smell the funk of a film! DAMN it was HORRIBLE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can anyone say they like this movie?! Boring, predictable, unoriginal death scenes, and bad acting, all the ingredients you DON'T want in a horror film! After I found out if was from the makers of FINAL DESTINATION I had high hopes from the film, but I walked out of the cinema highly disappointed. Only go and see this film if your having a hard time sleeping!! Crystal Lowe was the only average actor in this movie. I thought Mary Elizabeth Winstead would deliver a very good performance after seeing her in FD3, but she wasn't as good in this movie! Anyway, nothing new to the horror genre here, just the same old boring stuff! 2/10, VERY Disappointing, AND I AM ALMOST CERTAIN YOU WILL THINK THE SAME!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that some people out there actually enjoyed this film. It's yet another pointless, witless remake of an original which, though not brilliant, was genuinely unsettling and still memorable many years after viewing. This cheapo quickie, by contrast, has been thrown together without imagination or talent. The writer-director has either never seen a proper slasher movie or has simply failed to grasp what makes them work.The movie disappoints on every level. It introduces a laboured backstory for the killer, but makes the sorority girls so one-dimensional that you literally cannot tell them apart, let alone care what happens to them. The killer's predilection for gouging out eyeballs is unpleasant-nasty rather than scary-nasty, and is an inadequate, low-budget substitute for the great Tom Savini SFX of yore. You need only compare Black Christmas 2006 with the best of the 80s slasher pics (probably Joseph Zito's The Prowler, which really goes for it), or the brilliant recent women-in-peril chiller The Descent, to realise just how woefully inadequate this film is. The only compensation is the short running time - and even at 84 minutes, the damn thing seems to drag.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can the screw up such a simple premise? I saw this months ago at a test screening...it was a joke then- a real mess of a movie. Thinly plotted and confusing at the same time. But I heard about re-shoots...so there was hope.Now, it's even worse. No plot holes fixed...just more added! Clunky flashbacks that after a while stop being justifiably told to us. With a new "lunatic asylum sequence" and Dr. Giggles-esq "hospital finale" the movie now seems endless.I'm dumbfounded as to why Dimension even spent any more money trying to "fix" it the way they did. Andrea Martin is literally sorting presents under a tree for the first 30 mins of the movie. Awkwardly staged and boring. At least 2 of the actresses look enough alike to get them mixed up every time we see them.Do the filmmakers have contempt for this type of genre? think about it. If a director is making a movie that he wouldn't pay 10 bucks to see, then we've got a problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Very next day you do a remake. Honestly, this move sucked so bad I can't believe i'm taking the time to write this review. I rented this at blockbuster who claims to have the exclusive release of this movie, i don't think anyone should have bragging rights to this movie, in fact, if i were one of the actors or people associated with this movie i would quietly omit this from my resume and claimed that the actor in the movie is "Someone who just looks like me." i don't see the point of the remake. I feel that a remake should only be justified if you can add something that wasn't in the original, and instead of playing on the theme of the movie in 1974 but they've taken all the fun out of this movie, the suspense that makes horror movies so good. not once do you root for any of the characters to live cuz they start dying off at such a quick pace you never feel the need or desire. This movie ranks up with there with the remake of "When a stranger calls" don't waste your time on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could this happen? What went wrong? Is Hollywood so dry on ideas that they have to remake all of the low budget horror films from like thirty years ago? I guess so, and that theory proves it with this P.O.S. At first I could see a remake as a good thing (such as John Carpenter's The Thing and Martin Scorsese's version of Cape Fear) then the Texas Chainsaw Massacre came out. Don't get me wrong that one was good, but the rest that came after that (House Of Wax, The Hills Have Eyes, The Hitcher, The Amittyville Horror) were just plain blasphemy. This version of Black Christmas is no different. If any other horror film is to be remade, then were screwed.</fullReview>

When ol' killer gets back home, the slay ride begins.The character development is nice because we see a nice range of girls-Nice, bitchy, slutty, religious, etc. A lot of suspense and a lot of gore. This movie has a nice score and has some fairly well acting. If you like horror films you will definitely like this one because it is original and has that tone to classic horror flicks. It is a fun holiday movie that is for horror fans everywhere.I definitely recommend this slay ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Original Black Christmas is one of my favorites and I was very skeptical of yet another remake movie. Nonetheless, I was anxious to see it and went opening day. The new version, to me, was the perfect mix of scary and campy. Over the top just enough to be fun, but not come off as stupid. Characters enter the scene as if in an Agatha Christie murder mystery with lines like "Where is my sister!?!" Lots of eye gouging gore and the return of original cast member Andrea Martin, now playing the house mother of the sorority. I was surprised how the writers made this into a Christmas version of "Halloween", even down to the killer's theme music. If you want a fun horror movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but is worth the $7.50 admissions price, go see this before it leaves theaters.</fullReview>

Even though it was from the 70's, it could have been more terrifying. Just look at The Last House on the Left, that was from that decade and it was amazing. The 2006 version of Black Christmas was gory, scary, and perfect. The story line went beyond what was necessary which was the perfect, first move. The cast was perfect. Everyones complaining about how there are not Oscar winning actresses staring in it, but seriously, it's a movie about college girls getting killed. You cannot put Angelina and Robin Williams in it.

		<fullReview>The previews for Black Christmas made it look like a thrilling slasher flick- and although it did contain a lot of gore, I left the theater feeling completely disappointed. Black Christmas contains almost every horror movie cliché that exists. Lots of vulnerable, idiotic pretty girls? Yep. Terrible snow storm that shuts down the roads, making it impossible for police to get to the house? Of course. A killer escaping from a mental hospital? Sure thing. The power goes out, cell phones die. Oh, and of course, some of the cheesiest dialogue I've ever heard. There's absolutely no character development- it becomes hard to even distinguish between the girls, not that you'll care to. The script is so awful that it had the entire theater laughing several times throughout the movie! As my friends and I left the theater, we talked about what a waste of money it had been - and we heard quite a few similar conversations among the people around us!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just letting you know - if you have $8 to $10 and you want to see a movie, DO NOT choose 'Black Christmas.' I worked at a movie theater for two years, so I'm not just talking out of my rear. This was the single most awful excuse for a film ... probably in the history of film. I literally wanted to kill myself after watching this movie. It made me hate remakes. It made me hate 'Harriet the Spy' (because of Michelle Trachtenberg). It made me hate 'Mean Girls' (because of that one girl, whatever her name is). Please... if you've got $10, give it to a homeless man - you'll be more satisfied. *** OK, well IMDb says I have to lengthen this so I'm going to drone on about the terribleness of this film. It was so predictable. What is it with stupid white women? I walked out of there feeling like I just watched a Lifetime movie. Gosh. Never again.</fullReview>

The remake goes straight for the simple everything happens in one night, because of our attention spans these days I guess, and there are just too many incidents that don't make sense. They were trying for the old school feel of horror and they so missed the mark it's not even funny. I know that all I am doing is complaining, but this is the type of movie that brings down the genre in a major way; stupid girls with no character development at all, you don't even get a chance to care if they die. The killer is silly and, oh , the scene of the killer on the ceiling, not in the American version. I can't say enough how much I HATE this movie.

In the beginning the movie took off farely quickly and stuck with the story. It had direction in the beginning. Then some where in the middle of it, it strays...far. It loses itself and the characters start acting like there isn't this insane murderer in the house, of whom not even ten minutes earlier they were terrified of. It strays to a place where you forget what it's about. After that, the movie seems to drag on, stretching itself out and never really getting back to the story. It's a mess. The acting isn't the best, but it's...'watchable'. It's predictable from beginning to end. There's a few parts the should have been cut out because they were never explained nor used again and you wondered who they were and why they were there. There isn't even a score for this movie.

The bottom line here is that the special effects are terrible, there isn't one creepy moment, and the acting is abominable.

		<fullReview>A bunch of sorority sisters (among them Michelle Trachtenberg and Lacey Chabert) are trapped in the sorority house on Christmas Eve when a massive snowstorm hits. What they don't know that a former inhabitant of the house Billy (Dean Friss) has escaped from the insane asylum and is going home for Christmas...Boy--what a disaster! As a remake of the superb 1974 film it's a slap in the face to all its fans. The original had likable, believable characters--ALL the characters in this one are just loud and mean...you WANT them dead! The original had no sex or violence. This one has a totally unnecessary shower scene AND an online sex bit (which serves no purpose to the plot--it's just there to show sex). The violence (and blood) was minimal in the original. This one piles on the gore shoving it in the audiences faces. The original killer (Billy) had no reason for killing the girls making it even creepier. Here they give Billy a REAL sick back story involving incest and child abuse! And Agnes pops up too.Even if you don't compare it to the original it's still a mess. The acting is terrible across the board especially by Andrea Martin (the only returnee from the original). Also Oliver Hudson pops up as a boyfriend of one of the girls--but he's only there to get killed. The plot makes NO sense by the end (I'm STILL not sure who the killers were) and the editing is so fast and frantic you can't tell what's going on. Also the explicit gore isn't scary just disgusting and, again--you could care less about these characters.When I left the theatre most people were in the lobby laughing! They thought it was so bad it was funny. Many said they expected a horror film not a comedy.A sick, boring, mindless film. An insult to horror fans everywhere. A 1 all the way.</fullReview>

It sucked so bad it made me laugh, First of all it doesn't make any sense, For Example they're is one scene that Billy saw his Mom killing his father. Then a few years later he was influenced by that acting the same. No offense but eating other people is just sick, I mean No offense but I'd rather chop off my dog and eat him raw then to see this Garbage. Its the same killing over and over again, and All you see is what People getting they're eyes eaten by this Psycotic person who learned from his mom. I mean what the holy water is the creator thinking ruining a classic film. I laughed all the way until the movie was over. I mean no offense but next time, If They're gonna make another Chirstmas horror it better not be eating some person's body part. That isn't funny its just sick and Stupid. Another thing don't mess with the classic films I mean sure it may seem old but its better than the remake. All it is Some dumb Boy named "Billy" whose Parents always wanted him to die and want him out of the family. Then he goes on a rampage to pull people's eye out and eat them. Then He says "Your my Family Forever!" and all he wants is some attention. He wants his family to be forever. These group of Women are partying while Billy came and killed them all except One. At the ending all it is that she threw Billy out of the stairs and pretty much his back was stabbed and his intestines showed up and a bunch of blood and all. Thats all the movie is about. I Prefer you guys to watch anything but this movie. Its like watching a Girl being raped. Otherwords, Reatarded Nothing interesting and very sick and lame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Could Do a Lot Worse; You could Be Watching the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somebody thought it was time to dust off the rights to the cultish, dreary Black Christmas from 1974 and give it a fresh coat of paint. The results are underwhelming but it's still an improvement. A creepy, fun backstory is now in place, explaining the gruesome mayhem and the film-makers have provided a satisfying conclusion; something the 1974 version couldn't be bothered with. The cast is bright and game for the material and the director has a knack for horror which we all know from having enjoyed series like The X Files and the Final Destination franchise. There's enough gore and suspense to please fans of the genre but there's also a sense that this one was derailed by studio tampering. Could be better, could be worse. But it's a step up from the Bob (Porky's) Clark version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best slasher film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Christmas was a great horror movie it has some great gore scenes and three flashbacks they show in the movie was great too. Too much people said that this is one of the worst remakes and is not true this slasher film has some cool deaths and hot babes like Michelle Trachtenberg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Katie Cassidy and Crystal Lowe. I really like it is a very entertaining horror flick. In this remake they show better the story of Billy Lenz and Agnes. They show how Billy killed his mother and his stepfather and how Billy's mother killed Billy's father and they show Agnes newborn. I really recommend this movie to people who likes to see women screaming and killed one by one in a sadistic way. I was expecting a little more gore on this movie but is OK, is still with good gory scenes. I really recommend this huge slasher film don't skip this one, just sit and enjoy the slay ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when you think it cant get any worse then the original, they come out with the remake.... I had higher hopes for this remake, although don't get me wrong I didn't have THAT high of hopes, with today's idea of "horror" movies i knew better then to think it'd be good, but I thought it would be at least better then the sad excuse for an original, but instead it was more random and lacking in plot or character development, the only thing better was that they explained billy more so. Granted it is hard to make a horror movie based around a killer in a house a good plot to sell seeing as there are so many outs, (which was another thing that drove me nuts, no believability), but come on, why cant we have a horror movie with SMART people, someone to say 'hey lets go to the neighbours' or 'if we stick together outside of the house it'd be WAY safer then in the house where the guy can hide in any nook and cranny' or putting 2 and 2 together when they hear the story of billy, get obscene phone calls, their friends go missing AND only THEIR power outta the WHOLE block is out.. gimme a break... I know stupid people make horror movies more exciting, but SMART people make horror movies less frustrating AND then it forces the writers to brew up something clever in order for the killer to get these smarter people. I think they needed a better screening process when reading scripts and before financiers decide to give money to these waste of time and $$ movies... Don't waste your time, obviously my skin was on too tight... *see movie tagline*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent modern day slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard 2 complaints over and over again. The first is that all horror movies these days are scene by scene remakes. The second is that all horror movie, like these remakes are rated PG-13. This movie, while a remake, other than the basic plot, has almost no similarity to the original. It also is rated R, with no a lot, but a good amount of blood. Yet, people complain, despite the fact that this, not a great movie, but an enjoyable holiday slasher. The story follows, the same basic plot of the original. An unseen phone caller stalks sorority sisters. In this movie they explain the killer's back story, unlike the original. The movie was not scary. It was creepy though and entertaining. The characters weren't well characterized, but they didn't need to be, because many of them didn't last to long, and you feel like a character thats killed within the first 2 minutes, is characterized better than the major characters. The acting was good, and unlike other reviews, the cast isn't hard to tell apart, as they all get their own personalities, such as the drunk and the nice girl. I also liked the main cast of Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachtenberg, Crystal Lowe, Kristen Cloke, and Andrea Martin (who was in the original).If you were disappointed with other remakes and modern horror movies, you may be disappointed with this as well, but you can't say you got bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original Black Christmas at the Skyvue Drive-in Theater. At first, I thought that this would make a great drive-in theater movie, but it wouldn't. Night scenes don't work that well. Things that happen in the shadow get lost in the shadow on a drive-in screen. I saw this at the best theater in town and was grateful for the details. I recognized two of the girls from Final Destination lll. One has the cutest face of all time and the other has the nicest bod in recent times. With the lame Jessica Alba, Jennifer Love Hewitt, and few other four letter words that I would like to hit with a bat, it is nice to know that there is a girl who will share. Michelle Trachtenberg worried me in a television interview but was very sweet and personable here. I was in the mood for this movie or something. This will be the last movie that I see this year and I am glad that I ended on Black Christmas. It isn't supposed to be Citizen Kane. However, it was more fun and a lot sexier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure garbage is the only way to really describe this bile. It surely gives Hollywood a bad name and horror movies revolving around religious holidays definitely do not mix. I don't feel sorry for anyone involved with this totally despicable film because they deserve to never have a movie career after being in something this downright offensive and lame. Also showing a child being murdered is completely uncalled for no matter what the plot line. It really doesn't get more bottom of the barrel than this folks except maybe 120 minutes about scat. The rate Hollywood is going that will probably be next. Warning people to avoid this at all costs would be understatement. We all need to let Hollywood know we are sickened and tired of movies this disgustingly bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desecrates not just Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood seems to be taking the sick and deranged factor in films up a notch every year. But this time they really go all out to remake a movie that no one had ever heard of anyway just to have an excuse to show young sluts getting killed off in what has become the biggest cliché ever. It trys disastrously to be a cross somewhere between Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre but fails miserably to be anything even remotely worth watching. The much larger and biggest problem with the film is the way Christmas is used in the movie. I have to say everyone complaining about how it makes fun of the holiday itself in a truly disturbed and uncalled for manner are right in every way. A movie like this should never have been made and no one should waste their hard-earned money on such a horrible movie.</fullReview>

Who cares if it was a remake of a movie from the 1970s. Nobody ever heard of it because nobody went to see it the first time so now Weinstein thinks he's going to have a go with it and get the teens to want to go out and see this goo. Ohhh where to start with how bad this is - from script, direction, editing, acting, the bimbo so plastic you were beggin each one to die the sooner the better, and that's how horrible this film is and then you have Goldie Hawn's son uttering such vomit inducing lines as "You're being punked!" For the love of God Goldie, fire your son's agent! I couldn't wait for this movie to be over so I could run to the nearest restroom to take a dump. If I could give it a 0 out 10 stars I would have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i don't care what critics say about the movie. it is very suspenseful and that is what u see when u want to see a horror movie, SO WHY THE COMPLAINING!! if u complain about it then don't see the movie. this movie was excellent and was thought out well(not to mention the characters.) It felt like all of the characters had different personalities, and that is also why it was a great movie.Glen Morgan also thought of the deaths well.the movie had some great and hot characters such as:Lacey Chabert, Michelle Tratchenburg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Crystal Lowe, Kristen Cloke, and Andrea Martin(also in 1974 one.) And those of you that think it is wrong of Billy/Agnes to take out the eyeballs of the victims, well it is, but the writer is just trying to make it a good movie because he is trying to tell the people who watch the movie that Agnes and billy have a habit and obsession with eating eyeballs(even though it's gross.) But that makes a great movie when you are trying to let the people who are watching to better understand the character of Billy and Agnes!Like the other characters in the movie! In a nut shell this movie was defined well and was EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Christmas is set in a sorority house called Alpha Kappa on Christmas eve, a house where Billy Lenz (Robert Mann) used to live several years ago &amp; where he murdered his abusive mum (Karin Konoval) &amp; his stepfather (Howard Seigel) as well as mutilating his sister Agnes (Dead Friss). The house mother Mrs. Mac (Andrea Martin) has organised lots of presents for her girls like Kelli (Katie Cassidy), however the girls start to receive disturbing phone calls &amp; mysteriously begin to disappear. Has a vengeful Billy returned home to continue his killing spree? Will any of the girls survive to see the new year...This Canadian American co-production was written, co-produced &amp; directed by Glen Morgan &amp; is a remake of the original Black Christmas (1974) in a growing list of classic horror flicks which have been remade by Hollywood in recent years like The Hills Have Eyes (2006) &amp; Halloween (2007). First of all I will openly admit right now that I have not seen the original Black Christmas, although I do actually have the special edition on DVD I haven't got round to seeing it yet so bear that in mind. Secondly Black Christmas is one of those frustrating films which exist in several different versions, the 'R' rated &amp; 'Unrated' American cuts &amp; the almost completely different European cut which has a different ending, different kill scenes &amp; there are even character's in each version which don't appear in the other (Kelli's parents, the morgue attendant for instance) so everyone bear in mind I will be basing my comment on the European version. Got that? Good. The script is at heart nothing more than a teen slasher flick, the basic message is if you like your slasher films then there's a fair chance you'll like Black Christmas on some level &amp; if you don't like teen slasher films then you probably won't like Black Christmas &amp; I honestly think that essentially is what it boils down to. The character's are painted in rather broad stereotypical strokes but they serve their purpose well enough &amp; are no worse than any other slasher flick. I liked the lengthy flashback scenes back to Billy's childhood &amp; the horror he suffered at the hands of his mother, it came as a nice break from the standard teen scenes &amp; they were pretty gross in their own right with strong references of incest. Speaking of which there's some cool gore in Black Christmas (remember I'm commenting on the UK version) &amp; some great kills. On the down side the film isn't anything particularly groundbreaking, the revelation of the killers could have been better &amp; it's a bit predictable. I mean the killings started before Billy even escaped so as a potential red herring he was wasted &amp; as a result so was the opportunity for a surprise twist ending.Director Morgan does a good job, there's obviously plenty of Christmas decorations hung up everywhere &amp; the film has a nice horror film atmosphere. It's entirely at night as a fierce snowstorm rages outside. As already mentioned the UK version contains some good gore, eyes are plucked out, icicles are impaled in people's heads, there's plenty of blood splashed around, someone makes some Christmas cookies out of ripped off skin, there are a couple of decapitated heads, eyeballs are eaten &amp; I love the scene when there's lots of eyeballs hanging on a Christmas tree like ball-balls! I've actually seen the US ending &amp; there's a scene where someone is impaled on a Christmas tree which is cool &amp; more generally the ending is clearer on the US cut. Strangely &amp; maybe somewhat disappointingly there's no nudity other than a girls bare bum.With a supposed budget of about $9,000,000 Black Christmas is well made with that big Hollywood studio polish to it. The score contains many traditional Christmas carol's used in sinister situations. Shot on location in Vancouver in British Columbia in Canada apparently in a 29 day shoot although there were re-shoots. The acting is alright, all the girls are very good looking &amp; easy on the eye which helps. Andrea Martin played Phyllis in the original Black Christmas.Black Christmas '06 is, in my opinion, a pretty good remake of the '74 original that I actually rather enjoyed. It's nothing amazing but I liked it &amp; it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that. However this gets a lot of stick &amp; a lot of people don't seem to like it so maybe I'm in the minority, but then again I don't care.</fullReview>

Worse yet this film is even more pointless than the original also with absolutely no redeeming value to it whatsoever. All in all a dreadful, idiotic, and completely disposable film that shows just how desperate and how low certain producers and execs at a certain studio I shall leave nameless will go to make quick cash. I walked out of this film after less than an hour. Don't even waste a dollar on this utter garbage. It is dreadful, idiotic, and completely disposable in every way. If you are a horny teenage boy with a sadist side, go rub one out to an S&amp;M video because this absolutely dreadful film is not even worth wasting a second on.

		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of the original, as many others are. It's been hailed as a slasher classic for many years but I always just preferred Halloween. However, I must say that now my love for the original has grown, which is about the only thing I can thank the remake for.Because people, the remake IS as dire as you thought it would be and it almost made me physically ill. I feel even worse writing this review because the movie was directed by Glen Morgan, so great in his work with James Wong and a solid genre choice that had fans retaining a tiny sliver of optimism. Throw that sliver away.Whereas the original movie had the sense to leave the killer mysterious and unexplained, the remake gives us the background spread throughout the first half of the movie.Whereas the original may have had a few cliché moments, the remake seems to revel in contrivance and sheer nonsense, veering perilously close to parody in more than one scene. The excuse for the police taking their time to get to the house is ridiculous as is the "let's all just stick together" argument while everyone splits up. And the least said about the "I'm the killer so I'll just wait right here while everyone screams at each other" scene the better.It's just irredeemably bad and everything, I mean everything, is by the numbers teeny popcorn fare. A hint of nudity, an overexplanation of everything, more kills, more gore and yet nothing half as effective as that seen in the original and a final reel that holds no surprises and yet seems to think it does. And that's before . . . . . well, I'd better not ruin it for anyone still gullible enough to think this may provide a passable 90 minutes.</fullReview>

Black Christmas seems to be caught between a parody and a serious film, which hence makes a god awful film. Without spoiling it (although I don't think I could spoil it, as its almost totally predictable), I can tell you to only get this when it becomes a bargain DVD, and do not spend good money on it.

		<fullReview>This slay ride into the dark side of Christmas is nothing short of ordinary. There is nothing more monotonous in scary films then a group of young girls trapped inside a house whilst a psychopath tries to slash them up, thinking of films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and all the other straight to DVD copycats. However when I found out that this time the guts where going to be splattered all over the pies and sherry left out for Santa Claus it intrigued me slightly. Upon watching it, I wish I had seen Happy Feet instead. It's a fast paced but barely gripping storyline, everyone you expect to be killed is killed and the deaths bring nothing new to the genre. However there was the gore that all you little Horror fans crave, so I'll give it an extra star for suspense and gore. You Need to have the regular conventions. So I'll recommend this to teenagers who want that first date clinger, people who are easy to frighten, that want to be frightened, but otherwise if your looking for an enjoyable film, see something else.3/10 Poor</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to Christmas, but, otherwise, an okay gore-fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have rated this film a 5.5, but since they don't have it, I just gave it a 6.Black Christmas. A HORRIBLE remake of the HORRIBLE 1975 version. That's saying something. An absolutely disgusting idea for a movie on Christmas. Although, in a way (and by the way I'm being positive, here), it's a somewhat clever idea...but it's still disgusting. But, whatever. It's also an insult to everyone who believes in God and who celebrates Christmas. The filmmakers could have at least released this film after Christmas. But still, that would have been an insult.Also, this film contains terrible acting and an abhorrent script and very cheap special effects that make you roll your eyes. Only some were somewhat amusing, but if I tell you what they are, I'll spoil the movie...which I wouldn't mind doing because it's 100% predictable.Anyway, other than the terrible acting, the abhorrent script, the cheap special effects, and the insult to Christmas, this movie wasn't really that bad. I'm a huge fan of intensity and horror and gore, which is why I gave this film a 6 and not a NEGATIVE 4. It has a lot of blood and gore that really made my stomach churn, but that's the only thing to like about this movie.Even though this film is totally predictable, people who are blood and gore fans should absolutely see this film. It's intense and gory and totally shocking at some times. And even though the special effects are very cheap (by the way their budget was $1,500,000), it's still pretty gory and violent and suspenseful.Oh, and another thing to HATE about this movie. It's too short. It's only 84 minutes long. No wonder the filmmakers' budget was so small ($1,500,000). Saw's budget was $1,000,000, and it became a big hit and became very sucsessful. But Black Christmas is already dropping like rain and it hasn't even been released into theaters yet!An okay movie for people who aren't Christian, and for people who love violent and gory movies.If you're Christian, or if you just don't like horror movies, just save your money and go see a decent movie, like, Apocalytpo or Eragon (which by the way Eragon was worse than expected, but it's still a lot better than this).Original MPAA rating: R: Strong Horror Violence and Gore, Sexuality, Nudity, and Language My MPAA rating: R: Strong Horror Violence and Gore, Disturbing Images, Sexuality, Nudity, Language, and Some Drug References My Canadian rating: 16+ and 18A: Gory Violence, Frightening Scenes, Coarse Language, Sexual Content</fullReview>
