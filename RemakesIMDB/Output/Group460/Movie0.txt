		<shortDescription>No better Moses. No finer cast.Simply Outstanding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody ever wants to see a movie more than once because the quality and charm of the movies of today are just not enough to coax you to. But every once in a while there comes a movie which, firstly never lets you take your eyes off the screen for the full length of its feature and secondly,makes you want to watch it over and over again without boring you. Not only that, the more times you watch it, you feel that you missed something the last time. Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is that kind of a movie. There have been many movies made on the topic of this Hebrew born prince of Egypt, but none compare to the way in which it has been portrayed in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. There are a number of reasons for that:1. When casting the role of Moses, Charlton Heston was chosen above all others including Bert Lancaster, not because of his knowledge of the Bible, but of his striking Physical resemblance to Michelangelo's sculpture of Moses especially the facial structure not to mention the stout build of a prince.2. The sets for the film were specially designed and the splendour of ancient Egypt in all its glory was recreated especially for this movie.3. The role of Rameses II was given to Yul Brynner after DeMille observed his magnificent performance as the King of Siam in Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's THE KING AND I, confirming that he is well suited for a stubburn and malificent heir to the Egyptian throne.It was not only Heston as Moses who made this movie a success, but all the elements that came together, the cast of thousands, the special effects,the costumes, the sets and most of all the simply unbelievable "parting of the red sea".It is a wonder why this movie only received one oscar; that of the Special effects, yet I think it deserved alot more. It did not even strike at the box office. Even then it never fails to enchant millions, no matter what religion they follow. Movies like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and it success in the hearts of millions, shows quite clearly that a movie, in order to be loved by millions the world over, does not necessarily have to strike gold at the box office.To watch this film, you don't have to believe in God, but if you believe in good triumphing over evil and freedom from slavery of foreign masters, then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colossal biblical kitsch, courtesy of Cecil B. DeMille.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't get any better than this. You can count on this perennial favorite to show up every Easter just as you can count on "A Christmas Carol" during the yuletide season. The daddy of all contemporary religious instruction, 1956's "The Ten Commandments" is blockbuster spiritual entertainment in every way, shape and form, as Cecil B. DeMille depicts the life of Moses from his birth to slavery to Mt. Sinai in grandiose, reverential style. And what a life!This was the first movie I ever saw at the drive-in. I was only 6 at the time but I can remember the neighbors taking me to see this, snuggled up in pajamas and stuffed in the back seat. The parting of the Red Sea waters, the turning of the staff to a viperous snake, the green-colored pestilence of death seeping into the homes of every first-born, the creation of the tablets, the burning bush, the booming narrative. I sat in absolute silence and wonderment. This is my first remembrance of any kind of movie-making and the Oscar-winning visual effects and vivid pageantry are still pretty amazing, even by today's standards.Charlton Heston, the icon of biblical story-telling, still towers over anybody who has ever TRIED to played Moses ? before or since. Stalwart and stoic to a fault, he possess THE look...cut out of pages of my old religious instructions book....the look that radiates magnificence and glory...the look of a man who has definitely seen God. His commanding stature and voice with its slow, deliberate intonation is eerie and unmatched. Yul Brynner portrays Ramses II as if he were the King of Siam in Egyptian pants. Nobody poses or plays majestic like Yul. He's forceful, regal, imperious...everything a biblical foe should be. Anne Baxter as the tempting Nefretiri, Queen of Egypt, borders on total camp in her role, her stylized line readings and breathy allure is laughable now, with posturings and reaction shots not seen since Theda Bara. But who cares? Baxter provides the most fun and its her florid scenes that I now look most forward to ? whether she's throwing herself at the totally disinterested Moses or verbally sparring with Ramses, slyly pushing his emotional buttons. She alone puts the "k" in kitsch. The rest of the huge cast is appropriately stiff and solemn.DeMille's 1923 original version of "The Ten Commandments" is hardly subtle as well, but still impressive and certainly worth a look. In the 1956 remake, DeMille organizes a cavalcade of thousands to lend authenticity to the massive exodus scenes, while the ultimate picture-perfect frame for me is the three beautiful slave extras posing exotically and dramatically on a rock in front of a vivid blue-gray backdrop of furious, threatening clouds as Moses parts the sea. That vision alone is one for the books.Whenever I am tempted to break a commandment or embrace that golden calf, I know I'll always have to answer to Charlton ? glaring down from Mt. Sinai ready to throw those heavy tablets at me for my transgression. Charlton not only sets you straight, he makes you BELIEVE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeMille's Final Film as a Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ten Commandments" is a milestone film. For some, those of us in their 50's or older, it represents the end of an era: Some call it "The Golden Age of Hollywood"; the beginning of the end of the studio system; and the end of a period in which the real founders of the "public art" took, or began to take, their final bows -- DeMille, Zukor, Goldwyn, Selznick, and others.For those of us who saw "The Ten Commandments" on the big screen and in one of the now extinct gilded movie palaces of yesteryear, the picture holds special memories. There is a sense of nostalgia that accompanies any new viewing of this one-of-a-kind Victorian pageant. For many, I'm sure, the nostalgia extends beyond the film itself.There were problems in the mid-fifties, as in every decade since the real Moses came down from Mount Sinai. Polio, the continuing menace of poverty, the material and spiritual separateness of what we called "colored people", Communism, etc. But . . . there were virtues too, many reflected in the writing and performances of "The Ten Commandments": Virtues like courage, strength of character, personal honor, and endurance were paramount (no pun intended). The biggest problem in schools was students chewing gum in class. Today, it's students "shooting-up" in parking lots or shooting down their classmates in the halls. . . America had an identity then.DeMille's vision was, always, of "an ideal". He painstakingly produced authentic looking packages in which to wrap his vision -- embellished by the "glitz" of what was, then, the "ideal" Hollywood portrait: Bluer than blue skies; shimmering, jewel-encrusted costumes; out-sized architecture; dramatically convenient thunderbolts; and perfectly lovely female leads, with make-up invariably and predictably un-smudged. DeMille gave his audience what they expected from an "A" picture. He wasn't interested in realism. His idea was to reinforce values he'd learned from his parents and his brother (a noted playwright) in a dramatic format which could be "felt" by young and old, alike . . . more a reverence for time-honored principles than the analytical, ironic, and questioning approach dominant in the films of today. There was in the 50's and the 40's a more amicable attitude toward "orthodoxy" -- in all its forms. Hence, the overwhelming popularity of every DeMille production released during that period.After fifty years, "The Ten Commandments" is still impressive visually, dramatically, and especially in terms of the intensity of its convictions (reflected in all the biographies of the principals) . . . something which cannot be said of many similar big-budget pictures of the same era.One day, someone may attempt a re-make. Expect that it will be visually impressive and less "stagy". But . . . expect, as well, that it will be punctuated with the obligatory mandates of political correctness; an uncertainty about its message; and a healthy dose of Twenty-First Century cynicism. It will be more "realistic" to be sure, but far less "authentic" -- like a perfume ad, physically attractive, but without a "heart".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The eyes of the audience are filled with spectacle!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cecil B. DeMille was a motion-picture producer-director whose use of spectacle attracted vast audiences and made him a dominant figure in Hollywood... He was successful in a genre - the epic - that he made definitely his own, until William Wyler came along three years later with "Ben Hur."In his first epic role, Charlton Heston is cast as Lord Moses, prince of Egypt, son of the pharaoh's sister... As a true prince, he saves a slave's life; as a great prince, he gives the priest's grain to the slaves and one day in seven to rest; as a man of justice, he confronts Nefretiri with a piece of Hebrew cloth, the key to his origin; as a warrior and in excellent physical condition, he kills a tough and cruel master builder; as a courageous Hebrew, son of slaves, he tells the pharaoh: "It would take more than a man to lead the slaves from bondage, but if I could free them, I would!" As a man of prowess, he shows his latest methods of combat when he takes on the shepherds and routed them; as God's torch, he proves to be the Deliverer of the Hebrews, their prophet and leader; as the Lawgiver of the Covenant, he is the founder of the community; and as interpreter of "The Ten Commandments," he is an organizer and legislator...Yul Brynner is superb as Rameses, the rival of Moses... His arrogance and swaggering snobbery are well represented... Brynner delivers an intelligent cynical role... Regarding himself as divine, he rejects the demand of this unknown God and responds by increasing the oppression of the Hebrews... Anne Baxter is Nefretiri, the sensual princess who leaves her scar upon Moses' heart... Nefretiri is beautiful as a jewel, and her eyes green as the Cedars of Lebanon... For Moses, she is always ready to lie, to kill and betray... She is selfish in her life as certainly in her love... Edward G. Robinson plays Dathan, the chief Hebrew overseer who confessed to Rameses: "Give me my freedom and I'll give you the scepter. Give me the water girl Lilia and I'll give you the princess your heart's desire." As a treacherous overlord, he charges to the people yelling: "Go where? To drown in the sea?"Yvonne De Carlo plays Sephora, the midnight shepherdess to whom Moses is wed... Sephora couldn't fill the emptiness of Moses' heart, but promised not to be jealous of the memory...John Derek is Joshua, the stone cutter, who is totally convinced that Moses is God's Messenger...Debra Paget plays the delicate flower who quench the thirst of the working slaves... For her the hour of deliverance will never come...Sir Cedric Hardwicke plays Sethi, the mighty Pharaoh, whose words to his son mark great significance: "Who would take a throne by force that he has earned by deeds?"Nina Foch plays Bithiah, pharaoh's sister, who discovers the basket in which Moses has just floated down the Nile...Vincent Price plays Baka the sadistic, covetous, murderous whip-wielding slave-driver..."The Ten Commandments" is filled with tremendous special effects: Moses's staff turns to a snake; Moses turning the Nile to blood; the Passover of the Angel of Death striking all the Egyptian first-born; the tremendous pillar of fire which halts Rameses' men; the Exodus from Egypt; the parting of the Red Sea; and the delivery of the "Laws of life, and right, and good, and evil."The relationship between God and man is the powerful drama in our world... Moses is 'every man,' in his pride and humility, in his courage and prowess, in his love and hatred, in his weakness and confusion,in his conduct and ability...DeMille's "The Ten Commandments" is a moving story of the spirit of freedom rising in a man under the divine inspiration of his Maker... It is a remarkable spectacle with great music, filled with exceptional setting and decor...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The parting of the red sea! The confrontation at Mount Sinai! This movie is full of spectacular scenes and images! De Mille truly was a great filmmaker. His powerful imagination is evident in the Ten Commandments. This is his masterpiece. It carries you along on an epic adventure that is as big as the old testament. It captures the ancient, epic feel of the original Bible story. It has several stunning performances that could have easily been cheesy and fake, but are convincing and fascinating. Some say that the dialog is campy. I don't think so. I've seen this movie many times and have never thought so. It's nothing like the terrible dialog in Plan 9 From Outer Space from the same decade. The romance may be a cliché now, but it was quite original when it first came out and is still interesting. I personally don't like romance, so the fact that I wasn't bothered by this one is really saying something. This marvelous story is wonderfully told by De Mille and I would strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Behold HIS mighty hand..DeMille's I mean.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a fantastic movie to climax DeMille's illustrious career.Charlton Heston, king of the biblical epics, shines brightly as Moses, the one time Egyptian Prince, who now carries staff and perm in order to work Gods will and free his enslaved people from bondage.Yul Brynner, in what I believe to be his finest turn before the camera plays Rameses the Pharoah who's hateful relationship with Moses spans the entire epic. He is charismatic and shows off the arrogance of a stubborn Pharoah to perfection. This is indeed a film stealing performance.The beautiful Anne Baxter is at her sultry best as Nefretiri, the woman who would be queen to Rameses, but a slave in love to Moses. However the character is complex and I certainly had trouble in deciding who's side she was on in this epic battle of good verses evil. In the beginning she claims not to care for Moses' discovered background and is willing to be with him no matter what, however as the film progresses she does nothing but ridicule him and belittle him in true anti-semitic fashion.Edward G. Robinson, Vincent Price, John Derek, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Yvonne De Carlo, Nina Foch, John Carradine, and Debra Paget all lend fine and memorable support, to an already colourful and breathtaking experience.Incidentally it is worth mentioning that so convincing was Martha Scott in her role as Moses' mother Yochabel, that she was given the chance to play Charlton Heston's mother again in the later epic Ben-Hur.Another interesting fact is, it was Charlton Heston's own voice who spoke the words of God. It was Heston's own idea that to hear God would be to feel God from within, which is why he thought it would be interesting to hear His voice as his own.A remake of DeMille's earlier screen adaptation of the fine book of Exodus, many can see why this film ranks as his ultimate achievement. The sets were lavish and the story handled with suitable reverence and dignity.People today often make the mistake of comparing older films like this to the modern epics of today with regards to their effects and they quite wrongly categorize them as inferior. Today anyone can create CGI images on their PC. Even my three year old daughter can make something look convincing with a mouse and a keyboard and although these effects are great, people have to remember that CGI was not available in 1956.Okay there are a few obvious matte backdrops used here, but to achieve the effects they did nearly fifty years ago was an outstanding and impressive feat which took talent and knowledge. I tend to look upon these effects as superior because it took the use of mans own brain to bring them about. The human brain is the best computer available, yet one seldom used in todays world. So please take this on board before you slam The Ten Commandments for it's "cheap and nasty" look as one reviewer called it.This movie is ALMOST faultless, even the length is forgivable as I was so engrossed, I hardly notice the time passing.One fact that did rouse my curiosity was Moses' appearance throughout the film. I know he went to speak to God at the burning bush, but did he really have to stop off at the salon on the way back? Or did God appear to Moses complete with curling tongs and hair dryer? "Just a little off the top Oh Lord." And why did Moses seem to age more than everyone else? It seemed like he went from a youthful dark to everyones favourite Santa in the space of a week.This aside, this film is a fantastic piece of cinema and must rate as a personal favourite of all fans of Biblical epics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Moses, Take What Spoils You Will From Egypt And Go"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was 10 years old I saw The Ten Commandments in the the theater which is the only place it really should be seen. At the time I thought it was the greatest film ever. All that splashy color cinematogaphy and eye filling spectacle. The guy that put this together is some kind of special genius. Then I grew up.Today in a lot of quarters this and other DeMille sound films are viewed as pretty high camp. Especially those that touch on a religious theme. It's that dialog and The Ten Commandments longer than any other of his films has more of it. People talking some of that high falutin' nonsense, together with a good mixture of sex.What a lot of people fail to remember is that before Cecil B. DeMille came to Hollywood he was an actor and playwright on Broadway. He learned his trade at the feet of David Belasco, the premier Broadway producer/playwright of his day. In that Victorian/Edwardian era, ALL the actors, in Belasco plays especially spouted that stuff. I recall Anne Baxter saying that Moses spurned her like a strumpet. How many people do you know who use the word strumpet in their every day conversation? Or Yvonne DeCarlo saying to Charlton Heston that he Moses is God's torch to light the way to freedom and that by the way she loves him? DeMille made one great casting decision in getting the only actor who could play Moses and make it believable. This indeed was Charlton Heston's career role and as he said in his autobiography if you can't make a career out of the lead in two DeMille pictures it ain't happening. One other member of the cast Edward G. Robinson as Dathan loved this picture. Robinson had been dropping in star status since the late Forties and was now doing mostly B films. DeMille, whose rightwing politics Robinson despised, gave him this part and Robinson's career got a big shot in the arm. Robinson was grateful and gave him full credit in his unfinished memoirs. Most of the last half of The Ten Commandments is a running verbal battle between Heston and Robinson who is trying to keep some kind of control. Robinson is almost like the leader of a company union with the Hebrew slaves as members and Robinson sure enjoys the perks of office.The first half of the film is the sex part, hovering over all the biblical jargon. DeMille used an old gambit of his, two men in a rivalry over a woman. It worked in previous films like Northwest Mounted Police, Reap the Wild Wind, Unconquered and now here. Anne Baxter is a royal princess promised to the next Pharoah designate. But who will Sir Cedric Hardwicke designate. Charlton Heston his nephew or Yul Brynner his son? Anne Baxter has Nefretiri has both these guys hormones in overdrive. She favors Moses, but then Moses gets a higher calling.Though he was no director of actors and his sense of drama was generations old, DeMille was a firm believer in two things, fill the screen and make the films move. 50 years later the parting of the Red Sea will still make one gasp. It's not just publicity hype when The Ten Commandments is advertised with a cast of thousands, that is thousands you're seeing on that screen. Elmer Bernstein wrote the musical score for The Ten Commandments one of his first. He credited DeMille with teaching him how to write musical scores for film that underscore movement. This score brought him his first real notice as a film composer and he certainly became one of the best.Given the computer technology available today, one can only imagine what Cecil B. DeMille could create today. Of course he'd insist on some of the same writing, but then again without it, it wouldn't be a DeMille picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Command You to See this Great Film! ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What was the Academy of Motion Pictures thinking in 1956? Outrageous that 10 Commandments lost to Around the World in 80 Days.The entire cast should have been nominated for Oscars. Here is how I see it: Best Actor: Charlton Heston and Yul BrynnerBest Actress: Anne BaxterBest supporting actor: Edward G. Robinson,Cedric Hardwicke John Derek, Vincent Price. Best Supporting Actress: Nina Foch, Martha Scott, Judith Anderson, Debra Paget.Shockingly, no one in the stellar cast received acting nominations. Only the lord knows why.Yes, as my rabbi pointed out many years ago, the alleged romance between the Egyptian queen and Moses was overplayed. However, it can't take away from the magnificent acting and quality of this totally absorbing movie.They just don't make movies as great as this one anymore. They'd never have actors and actresses to replace the above great people.In 1956, Brynner did win the best actor Oscar for The King and I. He was far better here. Though, the award should have gone to Kirk Douglas for Lust for Life. Douglas losing, Ten Commandments losing, any message to be learned here? As for the film itself, it should serve as a pre-requisite for those in the industry who wish to make biblical epics. The sets were absolutely lavishing. I guess that opulent would be the best word to describe them. Who can ever forget the dialogue? Remember those princely plots. What alliteration! They just don't open the Red Sea like that anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When will Paramount Pictures re-release the 1956 movie The Ten Commandments to movie theaters? I know that the movie is shown on television and is on DVD, but this epic and incredibly successful movie is meant for the theater. Besides having a great cast, the movie tells a great story and tells it well. This movie will resonate with today's audience. Today's audience would enjoy watching Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Yvonne De Carlo, John Derek, Debra Paget, Edward G. Robinson and the others in the cast and would greatly enjoy the finale, including the parting of the Red Sea and the creation of the actual Ten Commandments. Technologically, the movie compares favorably with today's movies. Today's audience would respond favorably to the rich colors by Technicolor and to the music by Elmer Bernstein. In addition, the movie will help educate a new generation about events in history that have had a profound and lasting impact on the world. It will introduce the audience to powerful and memorable characters such as Moses, Ramesses, Sethi, Nefreteri, Bithiah, Aaron and Dathan as well as provide a glimpse of ancient Egypt. The scene where Moses confronts Ramesses and demands, "Let my people go!" is iconic and will definitely make an impression on today's audience. Today's audience will appreciate Anne Baxter's powerful performance. Why keep this movie in DVD land? Let it spread its wings on the wide screen in theaters for all to marvel. Watched this movie again and again this movie warrants only superlatives. GREAT story, GREAT cast, GREAT acting, GREAT special effects, GREAT costumes, GREAT EVERYTHING. This movie is one of the greatest epics ever produced by Hollywood. The scenes with Yul Brynner and E. G. Robinson and Charlton Heston are iconic; the scenes between Mr. Heston and the beautiful Anne Baxter are cinematic gems. Moreover the story is told in a straightforward way giving the movie the continuity it requires to stay on track, which is essential for a movie that is almost four hours long. Moses was a hero, Rameses his nemesis and Nefeteri the woman who had and then lost the man she loved, a Hebrew man named Moses.The acting is stagy, but the story is great, and Charlton Heston IS Moses. This is Charton Heston's greatest role. He is what makes this movie work. Heston gives one of the greatest performances in the history of Hollywood. Whether as the prince of Egypt, or as a slave, or as a shepherd, or as a leader and a prophet, Charlton Heston is the central player in this story. Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, E. G. Robinson, etc., are great in their supporting roles too, but this is Charlton Heston's movie. This movie conveys the intensity of a time when a people held in cruel bondage were soon to be freed and were soon to be led by someone whose emergence onto the scene is so improbable as to confound everyone around him. For who was Moses? Was he an Egyptian posing as a slave? Was he a Hebrew masquerading as an Egyptian prince? Was he a prophet? Or was he an opportunist, using the plight of the Hebrews to gain a following and thereby confront and defeat his rival Rameses? The movie raises these questions. Now the movie may not be historically accurate, but that's not important. What IS important is the story this movie tells, which is about a man who is on a mission to liberate an entire people from the shackles of slavery and sacrifices everything - wealth, power, the love of Pharoah's daughter - to accomplish what he sets out to do - and does it.There are some critics who make fun of this movie for its stagy acting and stodgy story. Well, this is complete balderdash. Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston were never better and Anne Baxter is positively beautiful. The movie is a story about liberation, redemption and hope. It's about people who were led from the house of bondage and became a nation, guided by the great and profound prophet, Moses. That this movie is remembered over fifty years after its release is proof enough of its timelessness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So big it's in danger of falling over, but it doesn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always willing to watch this, and I always enjoy it. Rather than admit that there is something wrong with my taste, then, I've come to the conclusion that it's actually rather good. It clearly has class, and spectacle. Perhaps it has other virtues as well.Say what you will about De Mille's stagy style: it fits the Old Testament. Whereas "The Prince of Egypt" went soft and new-agey when it came to the crunch, De Mille never lets us forget the harsh world events are taking place in. With a powerful and capricious god glaring at everyone all the time, it's not surprising that people - even pagans - take to talking in speeches. (The speeches are in an attractive, flowery style that isn't biblical but has the same aesthetic standards as some biblical writing.) And the god really has some Old Testament flavour. Everyone is terrified of him, and for perfectly rational reasons would rather pretend that he doesn't exist. This gets tiresome after a while. You'd think that after watching the Red Sea part everyone would have been willing to admit that Moses courted SOME kind of supernatural influence. On the other hand, you'd be a mug to trust this influence too far.Possibly the best thing about the movie is the way it manages to divide our sympathies without weakening them. Yes, we're on the side of the Israelites. But it's also hard not to be on the side of the Egyptians. The old Pharaoh is probably the most likeable character on display and the young Pharaoh, while he has his flaws, is a nice enough fellow done in by unfortunate circumstances. Moses gains our empathy early and keeps it even when his beard has turned to marble. Only the minor characters are villains - and they're fun, too.Of course, I say all this knowing full well that the entire film is, at the same time, completely ridiculous. Well, what can I say. It's yet another instance of a general law. Simple sincerity can sometimes spin straw into gold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still does it for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time it played at our local cinemas I went to see it and sat through it at least twice. I cannot remember how many times I have seen this wonderful movie. I first saw it when I was about 11 and marvelled at it as a spectacle. I wept when Heston wept and rejoiced when he did. As I grew older I came to love Brynner's fantastic performance and lust after Anne Baxter (only better in All About Eve). Cedric Hardwicke, Edward G. and Debra Paget (Hubba Hubba)all impressed me. I was sorry Vincent Price was killed so early - what a great villain. It still demands my attention when it appears on TV. I swear I have seen it enough, but if I catch a glimpse then I have to see it again!! I find it unbelievable that it won almost nothing at the Oscars. At least best Actor for Brynner and best supporting actor for Edward G.!! No costume design? No set design? No Music? A travesty!! See this if you have not already - you are in for a treat- it still stands up. Long but absorbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Charlton Heston wasn't sure he could over-act before he made this film, he certainly proved it to himself - and everybody else - here. It's hard to believe in a 'prophet' who can't seem to lower his voice below a shout.What's really sad about films like this is that it plays well for people who deeply believe themselves to be devout Christians, even though the Sermon on the Mount makes so little sense to them, they tell their children to ignore it, "nobody could live that way".Of course, this is the "Old Testament" story, so references to mercy and justice and charity are somewhat out of place, anyway. DeMille, quite accidentally, has played up and reminded us that ancient Judaism was an essentially tribal religion. How it became an all-embracing world religion and how it spawned Christianity in that process, is a long and complex story - and why bother if you can load the screen with beefcake heroes, rivers flowing backwards, chariots, and dancing girls? And it's just as well Heston over-acts like he's just taken Angel Dust, because everyone else underacts embarrassingly. Most notable are Edward G. Robinson - looking like a toga-wearing '30s B-movie gangster - and Yul Brynner. Brynner especially sleepwalks the film, looking dazed and confused; clearly awaiting instructions from the director that never arrive.Why is DeMille considered a great director? Because Americans love a truly clever con-artist. We know that DeMille, selling beefcake and cheesecake and special effects, is garnishing all this with the words many call 'sacred' in our culture, even though we don't really believe in them. He is not only playing to our baser instincts, but also to our hypocrisy.Anyway, his film has no right to condemn any 'Golden Calf', because it is itself a golden calf, an idol of the herd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Leap Over The Abyss Into The Light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, as we all learned in the paganized remake of this classic and Noah, if you remove the spiritual foundation beneath religious movies they collapse into boring narratives. Yes, if you are a pagan or an atheist this movie will bore you to tears, don't waste your time. The movie's power is that it is an existential allegory for a whole different way of life than reason. Moses is not painted as an invincible, comic book character here. He has to turn his back upon the people who raised him from a baby and go to war with them. My favorite scene in the movie has no special effects in it. Hardwicke's Pharaoh is dying; Yul Brynner's Ramses is waiting impatiently in the wings. Pharaoh says he can finally say the name that can never be said; the son he loves with all his heart. These characters are well drawn figures of both light and darkness like real human beings. DeMille wisely uses Robinson, during the exodus, to distract us from the most boring part of the story. The writing of the Ten Commandments with the Finger Of God, the unearthly Voice, the presence of God in the story is why it is powerful. When you remove God from your paganized movies, the stories collapse like Noah and the dreadful Christian Bale remake of this classic.The movie is an allegory that teaches not just the Old Testament but the philosophy of Soren Kierkegaard. A whole other way of being apart from reason: Faith. These people and their reluctant leader walk out into the desert depending upon their faith not their reason. Though I be a Theistic Existentialist, I think I can speak for all people of Faith, of all religions, in our asking you to please leave our stories alone. If only they would stick to remaking old classics from the 80s and converting them into crap. Yes, if Faith is funny to you, save yourself the boredom and don't watch the movie. Do the Israelites stumble, fall and rebel led on by Robinson? Certainly. They get back up and keep going. The movie intends to teach the central lesson of Kirkegaard that the path to God is through Faith and not reason. Yet, even Kant, in his Critique Of Pure Reason, argues that reason is utterly useless outside of a constructed, practical, phenomenal facade behind which is an unknowable, noumenal reality. Why watch it? Because, I assure you as sickness and death come for all of us, including your author, they will come for you. Reason will fail you, take it from a philosopher, its use is for practical matters; you will never answer the main questions of Human Existence with it. The movie models the words of Jeff Bridges in Fearless,"I can let it go, I can just let it all go." Yes, you can, the point is to show you not the Exodus that you have memorized in your head but the Faith that is being modeled before you. Everyone one of us must face The Leap even if you answer in the negative. They stand on the edge of the Abyss and they Leap. Yes, critics, if you remove the spiritual base of the story it will bore you to tears, don't watch it. The pagan copies of these stores fail because the godless filmmakers simply never grasp the metaphysical allegory that the stories represent: The Leap Of Faith. In my experience, I Leapt and He caught me. I invite you to re-watch the movie with new eyes. See it as it has always been before it was lost within an antithetical Zeitgeist. A Masterpiece Of Faith."Inward Is Outward And Outward Is Inward." Soren Kierkegaard"Whosover Shall Lose His Life For My Sake Shall Find It." Christ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sexodus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so funny, I don't know where to begin. Cecil B. even got the testaments mixed up. Early in "The Ten Commandments," the Egyptian big shots declare that they must find the infant Moses and that "a star proclaimed his birth." Wrong Jew, idiots! That star didn't happen for, oh, just years and years yet. But wait, in the words of Margo Channing, "It gets better!"The whole movie is one delicious,vulgar hoot after another. When it first was released in 1956, "Time" magazine, in a rare burst of wit, titled their review "Sexodus." I mean, there are Jethro's horny, whorey daughters out in the desert dancing like fools for the visitor Moses; then at the end of one scene Yvonne deCarlo looks directly into the camera for no particular reason as if to say "So, do I move here or what?" You'll love hot Yul Bryner with his braided pony tail coming out the side of his head (looking about as Egyptian as Omar Shariff looked Russian in "Zhivago"); the flirtatious Ethiopian princess, just drooling all over Moses (contrary to the plot of "Aida," and History in general, her country is only too happy to have been invaded and conquered by Egypt); and that blind man's line at the parting of the Red Sea about how God separated the waters with a blast of his nostrils is such a reverent moment in cinema.The plagues are embarrassing; no wonder the pharaoh didn't give in, and that Hallmark card "burning bush" was anything but on fire. Even as a child, I thought "Aww, hell, they could have done that one better." The Death Angel is only a trail of creeping green fog! Get out! Why didn't the Jews just use their fans to blow it the other way? God's voice is full of testosterone, as usual, but He sounds bored for most of the movie.And there are strange unexplained items such as how come the Golden Calf was sitting down? It only looks like a half-calf. What is Vincent Price doing in here? How many times did Martha Scott play Charlton Heston's mother? Where are the rest of the plagues? Where's the manna? Why is Miriam always in a bad mood?Lovely Debra Padget deserved a better musical number than "Death Commith To Me." I'd have chosen a ballad, myself, something like "Prisoner of Love" or maybe "Suppertime," because it was, after all, the first Passover. John Derick flashes some decent thigh.But, except for the bodies of Charlton Heston and Yul Bryner, Anne Baxter takes the plaid rabbit. She's the only one (except for maybe Edward G. Robinson) who seems to be in on the joke. She vamps and camps, seems to be having a great time. "Your tongue will dig your grave, Mamnet," she says before sending Judith Anderson off to her big dirt nap. "Do you hear laughter, Ramses?" she taunts. I wanted her to say "Not the laughter of Kings or Jews, but the audience! We're a hit, Baby! We can work this from here to Hackensack! We're killin' 'em!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 16 years old in 1956 when this movie was made. I don't remember how many times I've seen this movie over the years, but I was super impressed tonight. People today find it hard to believe there were movies made during that era that had these graphics and sound effects! I think maybe the redoing of them with Dolby sound and other effects make them more interesting to watch. I enjoyed seeing Charlton Heston, Yul Brenner, Yvonne DeCarlo and all the other actors when they were young. Most of them have probably passed on.This is truly a masterpiece! Wonder if they will ever remake it in 3d!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie of colossal grandeur and special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ten Commandments is truly a magnificent film and to be seen by all ages. The vastness of the movie sets, the music score, the storyline not to mention the special effects makes this a memorable film. However as to whether the storyline ie the Hebrews were slaves in Egypt, being true is a debatable subject. I constantly watch discovery and history channels on Sky TV (on ancient Egypt, the Pyramids etc) and nowhere in any of these programmes is there any mention that these monuments were built by Hebrew slaves. In fact the only mention as to the builders and workers were Egyptian farmers who volunteered their services. I, myself, being Jewish, and have always been taught that the Hebrews were slaves in Egypt. Is there any reader who can convince me otherwise. I recently went to Egypt and were given a tour by an Egyptianologist who was unable to tell me with any certainty that the story of the Exodus was true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To mount an epic movie based on the story of Moses delivering the slaves out of Egypt is an ambitious and logistically challenging task at the best of times. To have done this in 1956, without the aid of computer-enhanced effects for believable crowd scenes or real-looking historical sets, is more remarkable still. When our screen is filled with tens of thousands of soldiers or slaves, stretching right to the horizon, what you see on the screen really was in front of the camera. That level of resourcefulness and organisation is staggering to think about, and makes The Ten Commandments an admirable achievement by any standards. Having said that, there are moments when you might find that the epic proportions of what is before your eyes creates a stronger impression than the "divinely inspired story" (as Cecil B. DeMille calls it in his introductory speech).It is prophesised in Ancient Egypt that a Hebrew slave will be born who will one day deliver the other slaves from a life in chains and lead them to freedom. Jittery, the pharaoh demands that all first-born Hebrew babies must be slain to prevent the prophecy from coming true. One Hebrew family put their baby son into a basket and cast him onto the Nile, hoping that he will somehow reach safety from this awful fate. Instead, the baby floats right into the gardens of a royal palace, where he is found by Bithiah (Nina Foch) She takes the baby as her own and names him Moses. Years later, Moses has grown up within the Egyptian royal family and is revered as a noble, wise and resourceful Prince of Egypt. One day he may even become the next pharaoh, much to the envy of the existing pharoah's birth son Ramases (Yul Brynner). Moses and Ramases are also locked in a battle for the affections ? and eventual hand in marriage ? of the beautiful Nefertiri (Anne Baxter). Ramases spends most of his time plotting a way to discredit Moses so that he might beat him in their mutual race for the throne and the woman of their desires. Then, unexpectedly, Moses learns about his true ancestry. When he discovers that he is, in fact, of Hebrew birth parents he forsakes his royal status and becomes a slave. After many years of hardship - including a long period of being banished into the wilderness - Moses learns from God that he has been chosen to deliver the slaves from their appalling existence in captivity. He returns to Egypt and leads his people to freedom.Cecil B. DeMille had already made this film, under the same title, in 1923. This lavish and expensive remake is a better film though. Heston is excellent as Moses ? the role requires tremendous presence, and he provides it in abundance. Brynner is also very good as Ramases, etching a character whose burning envy towards his rival is convincing and memorable. At times, the dialogue is a little stilted and lofty; at other times it is actually quite eloquent (the parts narrated by De Mille himself are especially articulate). Elmer Bernstein's score is appropriately stirring, and the cinematography by Loyal Griggs is truly outstanding (hard to accept that Griggs lost out in the Oscars that year to Lionel Lindon's work in Around The World In 80 Days!!) The Ten Commandments features some fabulous cinematic highlights ? the 10th plague, the parting of the sea, and the writing of the commandments are a few that spring to mind. In between the highlights the film has its lulls, but even at an elephantine 220 minutes it never lapses into total boredom, and is well worth catching if you're a fan of biblical epics or old-style Hollywood pageants.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive film but don't take it too serious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is known as one of the greatest movies of all time. I only heard good reviews about this masterpiece of Cecil B. DeMille. So I decided to rent it and watch it during the Christmas holidays.The opening scene is beautiful: the sun breaks through the clouds followed by a surrealistic scene of Hebrew slaves at work in red (evening)shades. This is just the beginning, but there are many, many more beautiful looking scenes. To name a few: - the pharaoh's court with dancing girls, Nubians, flowers etc. - the Hebrew slaves at work at Gosen.- the depiction of some of the ten plagues which haunt Egypt.- the exodus of thousands of slaves into the desert.- the pharaoh's chariots chasing the Hebrews.- the dividing of the water of the sea.- the Holy Mountain of Sina? surrounded by impressive clouds.- the writing of the ten commandments on stone by God.It's not just the special effects, which were great back in the fifties but are somewhat outdated in our time. But it is the cinematography and the brilliant directing of Cecil B. DeMille supported by the musical score of Bernstein, which make all the scenes a feast for the eyes.But I am also a little disappointed in the film, concerning the story. At the moment I'm reading Exodus in the Bible. So I'm critical about the ?truth' of the story. The Ten Commandments differs from the original Bible story. The first two hours which tell the story of Moses as an Egyptian prince are not from the Bible. The Holy book leaves a ?gap' from the point that Moses is found in a basket in the Nile until the moment when he kills an Egyptian and must flee from Egypt. Undoubtedly Cecil B. DeMille used other (ancient) fictional writings to fill this gap in the Bible. The following of the story is much more true to the original Bible story, but also here it strays off from the Bible. E.g. Cecil B. DeMille used a lot of Hollywood clichés, like the romance between Moses and Nefretiri, the compelling old and wise man personified by pharaoh Sethi, the good Moses against the evil Ramses, the making of a superhero out of Moses where in the original Bible story he's just an extension piece of God (Moses only acts on advice of God) and DeMille even puts in an ?annoying' child of pharaoh Ramses. Also the acting is rather theatrical. They actors play as if they are in a Shakespeare play. All this is all right, because it can make the story more dramatic and more interesting, but again it's not true to the Bible. I know Cecil B. DeMille (and any other film-maker) has the freedom to create his own story. But in this case I believe many people who see this film think that this is the ?true' Bible story, which it's NOT really. Cecil B. DeMille made a grotesque epic of the original Bible story, which everyone can enjoy. My only warning is that you shouldn't take it literal. If you're looking for a realistic reproduction of the Bible, watch the t.v.-films of the late nineties like Abraham, Jakob, Moses etc. which are much more true to the Bible and to the period of 1200 B.C. But if you want to be swept away by a good versus evil story and beautiful visuals, then you must see The Ten Commandments of Cecil B. DeMille.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one magnificent film. Brilliantly directed by Cecil B DeMille, it boasts some splendid cinematography and gorgeous scenery and attention to detail. Not only that, but also a script that positively sparkles, characters that are refreshingly complex, a rousing score courtesy of the great Elmer Bernstein and a compelling story. Also impressive, perhaps even more so, are the astonishing set pieces and the acting. In the lead Charlton Heston is very powerful while Yul Brynner too gives one of his best performances. The supporting cast are equally impressive, Cedric Hardwicke, Vincent Price, Judith Anderson, John Carradine, Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne DeCarlo and Debra Paget are all memorable. All in all, The Ten Commandments is nothing short of the epitome of magnificence not just in its scope but also its complexity. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Grand Epic In Every Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cecil B. DeMille's epic masterpiece is one large movie. Large in terms of lavish sets, in terms of costume, in terms of acting, in terms of budget, in terms of music, in terms of running time, in terms of cast and so it goes on. It pretty much has all the ingredients of a grand classic and uses them all to the fullest. The lighting and vibrant colours light the screen. The cinematography and effects are quite good. Even though some of the special effects may look dated today, it works for this film and is a nostalgic break from the CGI. Bernstein's music is dramatic but likable.The acting is very theatrical but it all fits with the context of the film. The legendary Charlton Heston has immortalized the role of Moses on screen. No one else has been able to match up to Heston in playing him. Yul Brynner is majestic and intimidating as Rameses. Another role I doubt anyone could have done better. Anne Baxter plays her role like the typical heroine/temptress of the 50s and she is very enjoyable to watch, especially her line delivery, body language and reaction. The rest of the cast are stiff and funny but equally entertaining.Even past more than 50 years, the film feels like a grand epic and authentic with a capital 'A'. While a majority of recent big films lack heart, 'The Ten Commandments' has that even though the picture itself is over the top. I watched the film several times as a kid and loved it. Years later, I finally got the DVD and the film still amazes me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thou shalt watch this film....often!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monumental. Mammoth. Melodramatic. These are but a few words to describe this truly huge film. From the time C.B. De Mille steps from behind a massive curtain to deliver a pretentious, stiffly-reverent prologue until Moses has a beard down to his belly button, the screen is flooded with images of grandeur, spectacle and camp hilarity. The title of the film doesn't come into play until the last half hour or so. The previous three hours (!) document de Mille's version of the story of Moses as he goes from Hebrew baby to Egyptian prince to excised outcast and finally to instrument of God and deliverer of the slaves. Heston, in an almost legendary role, does beautifully in the first half of the film. He is gorgeous and hits all the right notes of a gracious and trusting and fair prince. Later, once he's "seen the face of God" his performance becomes catatonic and rigid (yet he still gives the film the undeniable weight of his voice and stature.) Brynner shines (in a year of magnificent roles for him) as Rameses. His glaring, spiteful rivalry with Heston creates a palpable animosity. Baxter is a camp dream come true. Every delicious word she utters is a mesmerizing hoot. (She gets the famed line, "Oh, Moses, Moses! You stubborn, splendid, adorable fool!") Still, underneath the chiffon and eye paint, she gives a heartfelt and stirring performance. A literal cast of thousands is on hand to support the star trio. Notables include Anderson as a bitter, gloomy handmaid, Price as a snarling, sadistic Master Builder, Robinson as a devious turncoat, Derek (impossibly tan) as a resourceful stone-cutter, de Carlo (at her most appealing) as the shepherdess who captures Heston's heart and Hardwicke as the hardened pharaoh Sethi. Many others lend their talents to make this a film of incredible proportions. The striking sets, vivid lighting, extraordinary costumes (utilizing five designers!), hordes of extras, a grand musical score and a sweeping story all combine to make this an epic among epics. Yet, today, much of the film is unintentionally funny thanks to de Mille's heavy-handed voice-overs and the horrible ham acting of the extras. Anyone who thinks that the leads give poor performances should check out the downright horrendous work of the crowds in the exodus scene and the golden calf rite. Any time a non-star opens his or her mouth, the film slides into hilarity. This doesn't diminish enjoyment of the film, however, but just adds to the fun. This is jaw-dropping film making that could not be done today without the use of computers. Those are real people out there folks! One of the most memorable scenes has prince Heston coming to the aid of a beaten down slave woman whose live is in danger. The woman? His birth mother. Buried deep in the cast (but visible many times in a horned hat and with a massive sword) is Clint Walker. His scenes with lines were cut as his imposing figure dwarfed even that of Heston and Brynner and de Mille feared the comparison. Like "Gone With the Wind" and "The Wizard of Oz", this is one of those films that became a perennial on TV and is hard to turn away from when stumbled upon. It may not bear much resemblance to the book it is based on, but few movies do. It is a spectacular piece of entertainment which is what de Mille excelled at.</fullReview>

Although many people will compare the special affects to the far superior ones that are computer-generated today, focus, instead, on the fact that this movie was made with what was available in 1956. With that in mind, the special affects are truly remarkable! The casting of this movie was perfect! I believe that Yul Brynner as Rameses was his best role ever. I still chuckle, however, that Edward G. Robinson and Vincent Price were in this movie. I would love to know what made Mr. DeMille cast them.

		<shortDescription>A Classic-whether you like it or not, that's your own affair.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie with a biblical story. A movie with biblical proportions. A movie with?well?quite a few biblical inaccuracies. Despite this, Ten Commandments is one of my favorite movies. Now everyone will be in shock when I say this, but it's a fairly modern and deep movie. It's a movie that uses old style, with new methods. Let's take a look line by line.Direction- Cecil B. Demille is a overdone, theatrical kind of director, and the result is a theatrical overdone kind of movie. But when the Bible is concerned, that's really the way to do it. Overdone gestures, poetic screenplay, massive sets and thousands of extras make this film a giant in Hollywood's history. Demille pulls it off however with his overblown style and flair. There are a few cringe worthy moments of poorly directed extras, but it generally works. It's overdone style was the director's intent. So I bet you're wondering how could this possibly be modern? Well it's Demille's amazing effects he used, lavish sets and deep story that makes it modern. Most movies at the time would cut away when the dead sea caves in, or show just a facade of a city, or a backdrop. Demille shows it all. Scenes such as the slaughtering of the newborn or the Passover were fairly intense at the time, and most movies would, no pun intended, pass over them. So like I said, Demille does this all in old theatrical style, but the actual content of the film was fairly advanced for the time. Charlton Heston- Very few can part the dead sea and you'll believe they just did it. Very few can be Moses. Heston gives a great performance of Moses that seems just like how you picture him when you read it in the bible. Search for someone else to play a better Moses, but I bet it'll be in vain. Yul Brynner- Cast as Ramses the Pharaoh, he steals the show in his outstanding performance. He's pompous, arrogant, but delivers great lines. He's also very deep, as that he's simply a leader who was determined, just for the wrong cause. He loves his son and his wife, despite the fact that the latter never returns any love to him. He delivers such a great performance, that he almost makes you want him to win. In the end, he won't however, no matter how long he may pray before the mighty falcon. Anne Baxter-Is the film's 'Beautiful enemy'. She's in the center of the love triangle between Ramses and Moses, the latter of who she is madly in love with. She's plays someone who's self centered, manipulative, power hungry and superficial and she plays it with remarkable ability. She fit's the classic 'Queen of Egypt' model movies strive for back then. I personally would have liked to seen her play Cleopatra. Sure, it may have been a semi-repeat role playing another Egyptian, but "She was Egypt".Sir Cedric Hardwicke- He plays the first Pharaoh seen in the film, father of Ramses. He does a terrific job in that role, playing a wise, understanding but firm leader. He speaks his line in stage like fashion and is all together convincing. He may have one of the deepest characters, as you will see in the film. John Derek- All films have their weaknesses, and this film's weakness is John Derek's portrayal of Joshua. Overacting, even on Demille's standards, and poor delivery of his lines makes his performance almost laughable. He brings the film down a little and is probably the worst part of the film. I don't see how he was cast, maybe he thought it would be the day his career is born. As it turns out, it's not that day, Joshua. Edward G. Robinson- Yes, America's favorite gangster was cast as a Hebrew turncoat, Dathan, who is an informant with 'Rat's ears and a ferret's nose'. Despite people's criticism of his performance, I thought he did a rather good job. He had his moments where I thought he'd say 'Step back Moses, or I'll plug ya, that goes for you too Joshua and the rest of you mugs' but he was still pretty good.Other Supporting characters- The rest of the cast is pretty good, Yvonne DeCarlo is solid and Vincent Price has a scene stealing performance as Baka, the Master Builder.Special Effects- Phenomenal. Who needs CGI when you can build the city of Pi-Ramses instead? This coupled with the partying of the Red Sea, the Nile turning to blood, the hail turning the fire, the staff turning into a snake along with countless other effects are amazing to watch. Most old movies would avoid those effects by cutting away-not the Ten Commandments. I'd say it has the best pre-1990's special effects of all time.Costumes- Breathtaking. The bright and ornate costumes really capture the essence of the time.Set Design- Incredible. Like I said for the special effects, do you really need Digital effects if you can just do this? Very few movies can rival the massive sets of this film. It's as if you are actually in Egypt.Musical Score- A joy to listen to. The pompous overblown score fits with the rest of the feel of the movie. Who else wouldn't want to enter and exit a room wit the same fanfare that Ramses does?All in all, the Ten Commandments is a classic. It is a surprisingly deep film, that uses theatrical style with modern methods. The film is among my favorites. With outlandish sets and costumes, over the top music, a poetic screenplay, outstanding effects, and exceptional acting, this is a film that is great in all regards, and will be enjoyed with all generations, a film worthy of 'the gods'. So it shall be written, so it shall be done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare, Timeless Film Does Justice to the word "Classic".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so popular and DeMille puts together such a cast that if anyone out there is thinking about a remake, I would guess the casting department would be mulling over who would play Charlton Heston, rather than Moses; who would portray Yul Brynner as Rameses; and who would be the perfect Ann Baxter? Doing a remake of DeMille's rendition would be like remaking THE WIZARD OF OZ or CASABLANCA.When her character is introduced at the beginning of the film, Ann Baxter looks stunning as she strikes a now classic pose. She also does a great job toying with Rameses mind in the palace, as both her and Rameses pray for their dead firstborn son to be brought back to life by the god, Horus. The words "So let it be written; so let it be done" spoken by Rameses father, and then by Rameses II. My favorite line spoken by Yul Brynner is: "The slaves are mine; their lives are mine; all that they own is mine." This finally cements his image as a truly tyrannical Pharoah, though any child would have figured this out already. The screenwriter loves to have the cast refer to Moses by saying his name twice in succession: "Moses, Moses!" I told myself once I would sit down and count how many times "Moses, Moses!" was said in the film. There is one segment of the film however, where the script is so 1950s cornball I can barely stand it. Everyone is so happy that all good things begin happening at once, i.e. " ... You have a newborn son!" (Yay Yay) If this happened in modern times someone surely would bellow "I won the lottery". (The scene I am referring to is when the slaves are leaving Rameses' city heading for the promised land).Still, DeMille successfully translates his own majestic, original vision creating this epic for the big screen. When I saw it the first time on the big screen at age seven, I thought this was the greatest movie ever! The frequent cornball dialog in places is easily forgotten when one becomes awestruck by all of the huge, glorious sets which are favorably complimented by solid art direction, cinematography and, as advertised at the time, "a cast of thousands!" This film is a "must see" for any serious film student, fan or fanatic! Enjoy with lotsa popcorn!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film in a movie theatre when I was only seven-and I cried! I was upset by the "injustice" done to Moses during the first half, and by the scene where his birth mother gets her sash caught under a stone about to be moved for the construction of the city. Since then, I have seen the film every year on TV-and I continue to enjoy it. But I don't consider it a great film. In fact, most of what once made me cry now makes me laugh. The stagey acting, the awful, pseudo-poetic dialogue, the inaccuracies, are nothing short of camp. Despite four screenwriters, sources ranging from the Passover Haggadah and the Midrash to several romance novels, and the consultation of rabbis and other clergy, the result is a Haroseth(mixture) of sweet, crunchy, bitter, and often hilarious shmaltz! What I enjoy are the visuals. No film I can think of so thoroughly creates what the ancient world may have looked like. Obviously, the costume and scenery designers did more research than the screenwriters. Each time I see this movie, I notice new details: the fanciful game pieces in the chess-like game played by Seti and Nefretiri, the jackal heads as bedposts on the prince's bed, the pyramids and pylons lining the avenue that the Hebrews parade down in the exodus scenes. And the costumes, many designed by Edith Head, look good enough to eat! I especially like Lilia's gold gown "woven from the beards of shell-fish." But the rest is like a bad high school play that you enjoy anyway because you know the actors are doing it from the heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Story Ever Told...up to that point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are advantages and disadvantages to watching The Ten Commandments today. One advantage is that it's still spectacular to see the great art direction and the effects that were put in in the era that didn't need cgi to be spectacular; hence all the efforts are more appreciated and the plot is more authentic (although Hollywood style). The disadvantage is that, in comparison to Ben-Hur, The Ten Commandments has not dated so well.It's still something quite admirable. To direct and manage something as big as this film could not have been an easy task, so what DeMille did is quite extraordinary. And there are some undeniable good things, like Yul Brynner's excellent performance, and, although Heston is not as good as he would have been in Ben-Hur, his Moses pose with his hands spread out is as iconic as anything.The film occasionally pitfalls in the dialog. Epics were hardly admirable for their accessible dialog. But at least in Ben-Hur (I keep referring to that because I believe that is one of the best films ever), there was an attempt to modernize the lines. Here, the screenwriters seem to have been more interested in reproducing more dialog as it'd written in the Bible than help the flow and pace of the film. As well as that, the voice over is simply out of place. Incidentally, because it is a voice-of-God narration, it's also ironically awkward.As well as that, there are some scenes that seen today just look laughable. Like the sequence where Moses has to choose his wife among Jethro's daughters who perform the dance for him. The sequence is quite lengthy, considering that we know he will marry the one who is minding the sheep, because that's the good natured thing to do.Another annoying thing is that the spectacular nature of the film leaves little way for the emotional side of it. The amazing surroundings make it so that there is little time to show the people's struggles. There is too little emphasis on the hatred between Rameses and Moses. In fact, Moses as a whole becomes a trivial character. He is always noble, throughout the film, but his transition from an Egyptian to a Jew is hardly explained. Such a transition should have taken a lot more thought and pondering, and personal conflict. Instead, there just isn't any of that at all. Moses knows what he is to do all along, and as a result, the character of Moses becomes more unbelievable, and we lose contact with him, because he is no longer a human. This may be good in the Bible, but it leaves little for the film.You may argue that DeMille is spectacular, but he comes from an old school directing style that gets in the way of the film's advancement. In this film, as in other ones of his, it is possible to see similarities between his way of working and Griffith's way. The actors are taken care of less, and as a result, the characters appear more distanced.Still, it's a film that should be seen, if not for its meaning, because it really shows what these religious epics were about and why people rushed to see them at the time. Now, the closest we get to that hype is The Passion of the Christ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The final film directed by Cecil B. DeMille before his death in 1959, this is an absolutely thrilling epic of a kind that is seldom made anymore. Based on a variety of ancient sources and modern books as well as the obvious, it is an extremely well written film with suitably grandiose and often marvellous dialogue. The characters are very well drawn and are never less than compelling. As indicated by the director's introduction in which he mentions that the struggle between those who are ruled by "God's law" and the those who are ruled by "the whims of a dictator" still exists, the film was partially intended as an allegory of the Cold War.Charlton Heston makes for a great leading man as Moses, who goes from being a Prince of Egypt to a slave to a shepherd to the prophesied deliverer of his people. I have always felt that he is underrated as an actor and he gives one of his best performances on this occasion. However, the best actor in the film is certainly Yul Brynner as Rameses. I think that he deserved a Best Supporting Actor nomination, even if he was nominated for Best Actor for "The King and I" in the same year. For most of the film, Rameses, the most interesting character for my money, is supremely arrogant and never doubts that he will triumph over Moses. This is what makes his final defeat so effective when he sees thousands of his troops drowned in the Red Sea. When he returns to his court in despair, all he can say to Nefretiri is "his god is God." He has finally realised, albeit far too late, that Moses was the one who was always going to triumph. Great stuff. After this scene, the first thing that popped into my head was the great line from Shelley's poem about him, "Ozymandias": "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" Speaking of Nefretiri, Anne Baxter is wonderful as the eventual Queen of Egypt and her relationship with Moses, which goes from one extreme to the other, is fascinating. Crucially, she has great chemistry with the two leading men, as they have with each other. From Heston and Brynner's first scene together, there is a terrific sense of tension between them and this slowly builds throughout the film. The film has a very strong cast overall such as Cedric Hardwicke, Edward G. Robinson and Vincent Price (both of whom are suitably creepy), Yvonne De Carlo, Nina Foch, Debra Paget (the only surviving major cast member), Judith Anderson and John Carradine. Of the main stars, John Derek is probably the weakest link as Joshua but he is still quite good.The film was the most expensive ever made up to that time and there is plenty of evidence of this on screen. The film is full of beautifully shot scenes and was filmed in many of the locations where it takes place such as Egypt and Mount Sinai. The sets and costumes are as extravagant as you would expect from the film such as this. The special effects, which deservedly won an Oscar, are absolutely phenomenal for their time and hold up incredibly well. The most impressive sequence is the parting of the Red Sea, the film's most thrilling scene, but I have to mention the Pillar of Fire, the Burning Bush and the creation of the Ten Commandments themselves.Overall, this is an absolutely brilliant film which is rightfully considered one of the best films of the epic genre. At 3 hours and 51 minutes long, it is the third longest film that I ever seen, after "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" and Kenneth Branagh's version of "Hamlet" (in which Heston also appeared). As with those two films, it is extraordinarily well paced. There was not a minute where I was bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even with all its Hollywood-ized content (glamour, passion, white faces portraying ancient dark skinned civilizations, with the exception of those portraying Nubians, Ethiopians and a few Arabs), THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is a noble, sincere, God- glorifying piece of film, presenting all of its characters as humans, showing humanity in all of its lightness, darkness, and imperfection. Moses, who begins as a "fair young god", a heartthrob who has the heart of Nefretiri and a conqueror who returns in triumph from a war with Ethiopia, evolves completely into a prophet of God, a sober, serious leader who delivers the Hebrews out of 400 years of horrible slavery. Nefretiri, the perfect female, skin as white as curd, arms as soft as the breast of a dove, madly in love with the heartthrob, shows her dark side when Moses, having returned from exile to confront the Pharoah, refuses to resume their love affair. We even love Sethi, played to absolute perfection by the great British actor Hardwicke. We know he has no love for the Hebrew nation, that they are no better than worms to him, yet we see him as a human being, a wonderful father figure, a man who loves his children, (it is a fact that in those days, half sisters and half brothers married, so Nefretiri and Rameses had the same father and different mothers) no matter what else he is. Robinson is memorable too, as troublesome Dathan, who is constantly planting and sowing seeds of doubt and distrust into the peoples' minds as they journey from Egypt to Canaan. He and Yul Brynner had some great dialogue scenes: "A rat's ears and a ferret's nose" "To use in your service, Glorious One!!!"The one loathsome character I could feel nothing for was Rameses, played by the stonefaced Brynner. I have never really observed any of this actor's other work, not even Westworld, so I cannot compare this performance to any other. I only felt contempt for him, and I doubt if Brynner is a bad actor. It's probably rather the character of Rameses who is devoid of humanity. I admit he had some cruelly good lines: "Give this Prince of Israel one day's ration of bread and water" and "They SHALL remember the name of Moses...only that he died under my chariot wheels!!!"The costumes are gorgeous. I too loved Lilia's golden gown that Baka made her wear, and Nefretiri's many sheer veils were lovely. The jewelry, war armour, and of course the robes of the peasant Hebrews were excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Testament, Real Wrath of God Type Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon viewing with my own eyes Cecil B DeMille's motion picture production of The Ten Commandments, I can only conclude that is cinematic entertainment worthy of the almighty himself, and one of which I can wholeheartedly recommend to my fellow man. For man shall be entertained by the will of great cinema, not be the will of interior productions, for cinema is cinema.OK I won't talk like that for the entire review. But yes, I love old Hollywood epics. The sheer scope, the bombastic music scores, everyone talking like they're Laurence Olivier, with everything they say being an epic monologue of well, biblical proportions. You can't get films like this made anymore. No studio would be willing to finance such a project nor would movie goers be willing to watch a film four hours long; they would run for the hills if you even suggest it to them. From the films I've seen or have tried to watch from Cecil B. DeMille (aside from The Greatest Show on Earth which I also enjoyed), his work comes off to me as dull, turgid experiences. The Ten Commandments is an unashamedly old fashioned, stagey and creaky film, even for its time; but that was DeMille's Victorian style. Yet with the Ten Commandments all these DeMillen elements all work; perhaps his entire career was leading up to this one film. The Ten Commandments is one of the most classic of old Hollywood epics, tapping in with the public's fascination with Egyptology. No scene during all fours hours of The Ten Commandments feels unneeded, something interesting is always going on, with special effects and sets which get better with age; fake but in a good way. Moses parting the sea is one of the greatest and most awe inspiring special effects shots in cinema history; I can never take my eyes off it as it occurs.Only a handful of scenes in the film where filmed on location, the majority was filmed within the confines of studio sets, yet it is impressive how DeMille is able to create such a vast world in spite of this, beaming with life and personality; a lavish ancient Egyptian fantasy land that you can lose yourself in, and one which feels lived in. The cuts between location and the Hollywood sets are seamless, while the widespread use of blue screen, matte paintings and miniatures helps create scene which look like beautiful paintings.Everything Charlton Heston says has so much weight to it; a superman who you would happily follow in a heartbeat. Yul Brynner however is the actor who steals the show; one of the coolest looking stars of the big screen with his distinctive bald look. With his broad and toned figure, no one could look better wearing that Egyptian head dress and attire. Rames is so evil, suave, chauvinistic and charming; at times you love to hate him, as other times you can't help to just love him. These guys are opposing forces of masculine badassery, with every line of dialogue they utter raising the hairs on my back.For the record I am an atheist and I'm staunchly anti-religion, however I can still enjoy films about religion. A friend of mine once told me that what prevented him from enjoying The Ten Commandments was that Moses got the east way out by relying on God's miracles in order to free his people from slavery in instead of political intervention. While I do agree, I prefer to view the story of Exodus as well the Old Testament as works of mythology exploring timeless themes of good vs. evil, as opposed to historical fact. After all there are no actual records from the ancient Egyptians themselves that they ever used slave labour. Four hours of pure entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant, breathtaking epic of a film the likes of which simply have never been seen since</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched The Ten Commandments dozens of time as a kid. It was an Easter staple in our house just like millions of others. It has been years since I'd seen it and this time I got the opportunity to see it on the big screen. There is absolutely no doubt that this film defines what an epic is let alone a historical epic. It is a lavish, breathtaking, enormous film that works to bring to life history in every sense of the word. When you consider the timing of the film and what they had to go through to get the sort of special effects they accomplished, it is mind blowing. Compared to today of course the special effects don't stand up but watching the parting of the red sea, or the Egyptian landscape and the massive scale of every shot and realize this wasn't done with computers and CGI but rather painstakingly created...it is sheer brilliance. I have to be a little picky when it comes to the acting. As with many old films of old Hollywood some of the film feels very over-dramatic and even cheesy at times. Some of the actors seem rigid and they think they're belting out a line to a theatre audience rather than a film. The film is excruciatingly long. I can't fault them for making such an incredibly epic film covering so much of Moses' life but it really feels like it starts to drag at the end which is unfortunate because the red sea scenes are at the end and that is pure brilliance. Despite clocking in at nearly four hours the last few scenes feel almost rushed in an attempt to not make it any longer than it already was.I can't tell you how much I disagreed with Charlton Heston politically and morally but there is absolutely no doubting his incredible screen charisma. He exudes masculinity and heroism. He brings to life Moses in an epically biblical proportion like no other person could. Yul Brynner is equally larger than life as Rameses. Heston and Brynner's rivalry and chemistry on screen is part of what makes this film so amazing. Both Heston and Brynner do have some campy dialogue but somehow they both make it work. Anne Baxter is a legend in her role but in my opinion was one of those aforementioned characters in the movie that delivered their lines with a lot of cheese. She really overacts in every scene and while her beauty works, she isn't a stand out success. Edward G. Robinson is perfect as the slimy, villainous Dathan. He looks the part and plays it even better. Yvonne De Carlo, Debra Paget, and John Derek all deserve honourable mention for their performances in the film. The cast works so well together and they overcome any dawdling script issues which there are a few.I mean, what can you say about Cecil B. DeMille? The man is a legend and this film shows exactly why. This was a labour of love for him unlike anything I've ever seen. The sheer details that he went to in making this as closely historically and scripturally accurate is so impressive. The film endears itself to you because you feel like you are there in Egypt, in the time of Moses and few films can do that for you. Whereas some historical epics will bypass certain details in order to fit for time or dramatic element, it seems to me that this film misses nothing in the story of Moses. If you love historical epics...well you don't get many of them anymore. But this is truly where its at. It has to be seen to be believed and I am so glad I saw it on the big screen. It is the definition of a true classic. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ten Commandments Is A Must See Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ten Commandments is an epic film that is based on the biblical story of the Exodus, in which the Hebrew-born Moses, an adopted Egyptian prince, becomes the deliverer of the Hebrew slaves. It starred Charlton Heston in the lead role together with Yul Brynner as his adoptive brother, Pharaoh Rameses II, Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora, Debra Paget as Lilia, and John Derek as Joshua. The supporting cast includes Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Pharaoh Seti I, Nina Foch as Bithiah, Martha Scott as Yoshebel, Judith Anderson as Memnet, Vincent Price as Baka, and John Carradine as Aaron.It was directed by Cecil B. DeMille,his last film.The story relates the life of Moses, from the time he was discovered in the bull rushes as an infant by the Pharaoh's daughter, to his long, hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses starts out as Pharoah's adopted son and an expert at designing pyramids but when he soon discovers his true Hebrew heritage, he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses, he returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court, warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later, Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai, who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, the Hebrews are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines.High atop the mountain, Moses witnesses God's creation of the stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments. When he finally climbs down, Moses beholds his people's iniquity and hurls the tablets at the idol in a rage. The idol explodes, and Dathan and his followers are killed. After God forces them to endure forty years' exile in the desert wandering lost, to kill off the rebellious generation, the Hebrews are about to arrive in the land of Canaan. An elderly Moses, who, however, is not allowed to enter the promised land, because he disobeyed the lord at the waters of strife,then appoints Joshua to succeed him as leader, says a final good bye to Sephora, and goes forth to his destiny.DeMille's last film may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted, but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. With a running time of nearly four hours, it is the most extravagant movie that is full of the absurdities and vulgarities one expects and it isn't boring for a minute.Also,it is the director's biggest, most spectacular epic, excessive and lurid but extravagantly entertaining, this all-star spectacular is a spectacular retelling of the great Bible story in which displays himself as a showman.It is definitely a must see!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful "Bible-comes-alive" experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This outstanding cinematic experience, which I have seen at least forty times, is one which almost never bores me. This movie, which Cecil B. DeMille wrote, produced, and directed, was his greatest magnus opus or, in Winston Churchhill's words, it was his "Finest hour". And there seemed to be a smooth transition on the parts of the cast members into their Biblical counterparts. Charlton Heston typified the strong Moses very well, and Yul Brynner let the world know what a mean ruler the Pharoah was. Anne Baxter helped people to see what type of tempting person the Egyptian queen Nefretiri was. John Derek made a strong Joshua, Debra Paget accomplished a great feat, and Edward G. Robinson, famous for portraying crooks, was the singular actor for Dathan, the "crook" a la ca. 1500 B.C. Vincent Price, as Baka, was his usually mean self. Yvonne DeCarlo was a sweet and understanding Zipporah, the wife of Moses. All the actors, again, acted in their parts well. The scenery depicted the topography of that day almost perfectly, and should have, since so much of it was filmed in the Bible lands themselves,(though some were filmed in Hollywood as well.) The parting of the Red Sea was almost lifelike and gave the "you-are-there" feeling, something I experienced when I saw the movie fifty-three years ago, as a boy of twelve. Despite the fact that there was a lot of dramatic license taken with the film, it still gave viewers an excellent insight into what the Exodus of Moses and the other Hebrew people must have been like. As a minister I like to see the Bible, again, "come alive", and this was the case with this outstanding movie production. All things considered, it was a production almost unequaled anytime in the history of Hollywood. Great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How much you like and appreciate this film probably depends upon three factors: how you feel about old-fashioned Christianity, how you feel about the excesses of Technicolor, and how you feel about Charleton Heston. Due to his conservative gun-toting beliefs, it's not easy for me to watch Heston, but I willingly make two exceptions -- this film, and Ben-Hur. This is old-fashioned story telling at its best, as told by a master story-teller -- Cecil B. Demille. And it shows...adjusted for inflation, it is the 5th highest grossing film in Hollywood's history.The only downer is that if you have a high definition television, the fact that many of the scenes are played in front of a screen behind which are projected realistic scenes of Egypt will be obvious...but again, this was 1957.The scope of the story is tremendous, and its length (220 minutes) reflects that. But, there's not a minute wasted. Particularly well acted are a number of scenes, including the one where Moses (Heston) learns of his true heritage. This is an interesting scene, too, because the acting is almost more of a classical nature, here. And, who can forget that first time they saw Moses part the Red Sea? Yes, today it looks rather cartoonish, but when you consider that this film was made in 1956, that special effects becomes very impressive.There are too many actors to give note to each of their performances, but I will mention a few: This was Heston's most impressive role to date, and indeed, he is commanding in this role. Yul Brynner, always low on my list as an actor, is, nevertheless equally impressive here as Pharaoh Rameses II; he really struts! Anne Baxter is wonderful as Nefretiri, the love interest of both Moses and Ramses. Edward G. Robinson -- though one of the bad guys -- is extremely effective as Dathan. I was surprised to learn that it was Yvonne De Carlo who was playing Moses' wife...quite a good performance. John Derek, as Joshua, is very good here. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is impressive as Pharaoh Seti, as is Nina Foch as Bithiah, the adoptive mother of Moses and sister to Seti. The venerable Martha Scott is wonderful as the natural mothers of Moses (just as she was later the mother of Ben-Hur. Henry Wilcoxon is another face you'll recognize and appreciate...this time as Pharaoh's charioteer. And I was happy to notice H.B. Warner (the druggist in "It's A Wonderful Life") as a sick old man.This is such a classic film that anyone interested in American cinema ought to watch it attentively at least once. Definitely one for the DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To those familiar with theoretical concepts of filmmaking my comments here will probably appear ridiculous; however, to me, a complete layman, the things that I want to talk about seem rather intriguing.First, I'd like to say that the Ten Commandments is the only epic of its kind that I happened to see so far, which, by the way, I did just a little while ago, because this kind of movie is not, shall we say, your everyday entertainment in the predominantly atheistic Russia.What attracts me to this film, however, isn't its subject matter or particular genre, but rather something about its cinematography, which I never noticed in any other movie.The thing that I found remarkable is that every major (and hence predictable) scene looks exactly as you would expect it to look like in terms of the composition, the camera angle and the general direction in which the characters move.Do other people feel so too, or is it just me? Maybe we're talking about some archetypes here? Anyway, plainly speaking, it looks like Mr. DeMille was someone who really managed to strike the right chord.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I have recently been reading the Holy Bible with a fine tooth comb, I was eagerly anticipating watching this film on DVD (I hadn't seen it before). I was not disappointed. While revisionist historians have recently questioned the veracity of the Old Testament, I believe the story of Moses was beyond realm of the human mind to invent. While I still believe in them, I am not as sure about the monarchies of David and Solomon. But The Ten Commandments is the story of Moses leading his people, the Hebrews, out of Egypt. The supporting cast, sets, and special effects are spectacular even today. But this film clearly belongs to Yul Brynner's Pharoh and Heston's Moses. Great, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So let it be written - so let it be done! This is an all-time classic, which probably deserves more attention that it has got. Yes, it's hammy sometimes, cheezy too, but always good value, the special effects are excellent for its age, and the whole thing has EPIC written all over it. Charlton Heston gives an excellent performance as Moses, Edward G Robinson is suitably nefarious as Dathan, and there's great performances all round from Anne Baxter and Yul Brynner. The expression "total cinema" always comes to mind, and it stands up perfectly to repeated viewings... especially around Passover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spectacular example of its type</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is interesting to compare The Ten Commandments with Spartacus, another historical spectacular made only 4 years later. DeMille's roots in the conventions of 19th century melodrama are clearly evident, while Kubrick looks to Freud, Stanislavsky, and The Method. These sensibilities apply as well to the respective scripts, the language of The Ten Commandments being grounded in a biblically-based floridness, while that of Spartacus is imbued with a grittily contemporary realism. Is one inherently superior to the other? Does a liking for Stravinsky preclude a love of Schubert? Of course not; each can be savored for what it is (though I must admit that the dialogue in 'Commandments' can get ponderously creaky at times).It is difficult, with the passage of the years, not to view Heston's performance as a caricature of itself, but if one can peel back the encrustation of time, there is undeniable power there. Yul Brynner's portrayal of Rameses is delicious ("So let it be written. So let it be done!") but one does have the nagging suspicion during his scenes that a hoop-skirted Deborah Kerr might appear at any moment. Edward G. Robinson is a tad miscast as Dathan, and one almost expects Vincent Price as Baka to twirl the tips of his villainous mustache, if he had one.Everything is drawn with an unashamedly broad-stroked brush, and it is best just to lean back and enjoy the proceedings in all their quasi-tacky splendor. DeMille obviously had huge fun with the portrayal of the plagues, for instance. The special effects are, unfortunately, sadly dated in many cases (e.g. the fingers of fire writing the tablets, and the parting of the sea) and the portrayal of the debauchery before the golden calf seems to derive from some spinster sunday school teacher's idea of what an orgy must be like (then again, it's a sad commentary on what the decline of standards of screen decency over the years has led us to expect; one shudders to imagine how such a scene would be staged today).At any rate, the movie is definitely a classic of its type and is enjoyable at many levels if you let yourself go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cecil B. DeMille is often regarded as a specialist in Biblical epics, although these formed only a small part of his large total output. He made several epics, not all Biblical, during the silent era, and did his best to keep the genre alive during the thirties, a period during which it had gone into a decline, largely because of the difficulties of location shooting in the early days of sound.DeMille had made a silent film on the subject of "The Ten Commandments" in 1923, and in 1956 remade it in sound and colour. The film tells the story of Moses and the. Exodus, although it is not always faithful to the Biblical account. In this version Moses is believed to be the son of the Egyptian Princess Bithiah and is the adopted son of her brother, the Pharaoh Seti I. The film focuses on the supposed rivalry of Moses with the Pharaoh's own son Rameses. The two men are rivals for power and for the love of the same woman, the "throne princess" Nefretiri, who is destined to marry the next Pharaoh. (The relationship between Moses, Rameses and Nefretiri parallels that between Sinuhe, Horemheb and Baketaten in another epic set in Egypt, "The Egyptian" from two years earlier).At first Moses seems set to become the next Pharaoh; he has impressed Seti by proving his mettle as a military leader and as peacetime administrator, and Nefretiri is deeply in love with him. When, however, Moses discovers his own background as the son of Hebrew slaves, he abandons the idea of taking power in Egypt, is converted to the worship of the Hebrew God and plans to liberate his people from slavery. Rameses marries Nefretiri and becomes Pharaoh on Seti's death, leading to his final confrontation with Moses.DeMille was seventy-five in 1956, and in some ways this is very much an old man's film. It is conservative in its religious values, being as respectful as possible to the Jewish and Christian scriptures and traditions. It is conservative in its language; although most of the dialogue is not taken directly from the Bible it has a formal, Biblical ring to it. It is also conservative in its formal, stylised, non-naturalistic acting. In some ways it is the film the Victorians might have made about Moses had they possessed twentieth-century cinema technology.In other respects, however, this is a film of its time. The epic came back into favour in the late forties, as Hollywood saw spectacle as its main weapon in its battle with television, and "The Ten Commandments" is the most spectacular film of its period, with a massive cast and thrilling set pieces like the parting of the Red Sea. Today, this would probably be a simple task for the effects department, but in pre-CGI days it was something special. (The film deservedly won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects). The film may be conservative in its religious values but is surprisingly liberal in its political ones, foreshadowing "Spartacus" in its emphasis on racial equality and human dignity. This is shown by the development of the character of Moses. Early in the film he is an "enlightened despot" who can see nothing wrong with the idea that the Hebrews should be slaves of the Egyptians, although he treats them more humanely than does Rameses. Only later is he converted to the ideal of the equality of all men under God.The film has its faults, some of them connected with its casting. Nina Foch was too young to be credible the presumed mother of Charlton Heston, who was actually a year older than her. It would have been better to have cast another actress as the older Bithiah. Yvonne De Carlo, perhaps the loveliest of several lovely actresses in this film was always too elegant as the nomadic shepherdess Sephora, especially as the script suggests that Sephora is rather plain. Another weakness is that neither DeMille nor his scriptwriters grasped the differences between the fierce religious tribalism of the Exodus story and the ethical monotheism of the New Testament, so morally repellent episodes such as the Slaying of the Firstborn are presented as the just acts of a righteous God.The film's faults, however, are vastly outweighed by its merits. DeMille's previous Biblical epic "Samson and Delilah" is something of a failure, largely because of weak performances from its stars Hedy Lamarr and Victor Mature. Here, however, he can call upon excellent acting, especially from Heston who brings the required dignity and gravitas to the role of Moses. Heston receives good support from Yul Brynner as Rameses, a man who is not completely evil, but corrupted by the temptations of power and by his obsession with proving himself a better man than Moses, both as a leader and as a lover. Other noteworthy contributions come from Cedric Hardwicke as the wise old Seti, Anne Baxter as the vindictive Nefretiri and from Edward G. Robinson as the Hebrew Quisling Dathan who throws his lot in with the Egyptians.This was DeMille's last film as director. He acted as producer of "The Buccaneer" two years later, but was unable to direct it through illness. "The Ten Commandments" was, however, a fitting climax to his career, far more so than "The Buccaneer" would have been. (That film, as directed by his son-in-law Anthony Quinn, is a poor one, but I doubt if DeMille could have made it significantly better). It is a fine achievement, a film which is spectacular but which showed that the epic form could offer more than empty spectacle. At the date it was made it was probably the greatest epic ever. Later directors such as William Wyler ("Ben-Hur"), Stanley Kubrick ("Spartacus") and Anthony Mann ("El Cid") were to equal DeMille's achievement, perhaps even surpass it, but it was he who had laid the foundations on which they built. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since seeing it as a boy, "The Ten Commandments" was one of the best and most influential epics I've ever seen! After the movie being over 50 years in age, I still considered it as being one of the best and most influential of films. Here's why: The story: Based off of the Holy Scriptures and the other related books, the film bases is about the tale of Moses. The film follows closely (some of it fictionalized), as Moses rises from fame and glory, to exile and hopeless, and to then crossing the path of the spiritual. There he becomes one of ancient history's most inspiring and unforgettable heroes, as he leads his people, the imprisoned Hebrews, to salvation from the grasps of the cruel tyranny of the Egyptians. Supported by the moving narration of Cecil B. Demille, the story flourishes and makes you believe in it.The Acting: Charlton Heston, as the lead, gave a very compelling and believable role as Moses. From his words of cool wisdom, to his thunderous shouts, he is not only a thespian, but a pure image of Moses. In second billing, Yul Brynner is likewise astounding. His performance of Ramses the II was cold, powerful, and unsympathetic to the imprisoned Hebrews.And in addition is Anne Baxter, who plays very, very well as the tempting, seductive, and deceptive Nefeteri. She can either be easily adored, or despised. There are countless other cast members, such as: John Derek, Edward J. Robinson, John Carradine, Sir Edward Hardwicke, any many more faces were all fit and believable in their roles.The Film-making: Till this day, in my mind, it is amazing to watch. From its massive production design (one of the largest recorded in Hollywood history), to the costume designs, the lighting, colorization, and the thousands of extras that floods the picture with an authentic grandeur, it is outstanding. Added to this, the music composed by Elmer Bernstein is pounding and uplifting.Astonishing! Engulfing! Though-provoking! Brilliant! Vivid! Magnitude! I could only praise it, even if it is nearly a four hour film. (for me, the four hours flew by). This is one of the few epic films that follows the three main guidelines needed for an epic on such a grand scale: story, acting, and film-making talent. There's without doubt after seeing this film, your mind will be stuck on it for days.**** out of ****</fullReview>

He plays it with so much umph that it makes you want to cringe when he says, "So let it be written, so let it be done".Anne Baxter isn't quite the part I would have had in mind for Nefertiri, but it works out towards the end of the film, she's there for the glitz and glamor.The effects are amazing (especially for a movie made in 1956), and it really makes you think about the time that the Jews really faced, which brings me to another thing. Almost no one in this movie is Jewish, with few exceptions.But come around Easter, you'll want to turn on ABC and take the time to watch it, it's that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still The Greatest Bible Epic Of The Silver Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ten Commandments was on tonight, as usual around Easter time on Channel 7 ABC. Released in 1956, it ranks as one of the most expensive and "epic" movies ever made, right up there with 1939's Gone With The Wind and 1997's Titanic. Charleton Heston, in a defining role that he will be remembered for even after his death, is Moses, looking every bit the Moses of Michelangelo's statue. His dramatic performance is Oscar worthy. Yul Brynner as Ramses, Anne Baxter as Princess Nefertiri, Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, Vincent Price as Baka and Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora. A cast of millions, beautiful cinematography, a stilted, high-blown and poetic script (it was taken from two novels) and powerful, climatic music makes this the best film ever made about a biblical subject. While both Christians and Jews can enjoy this film around Easter/Passover time, even people who are not of the Judeo-Christian faith can enjoy the film as a classic work of 50's cinema. It is definitely a movie of its time. In the 50's, television was posing a threat to the film industry, since people were spending more time in front of the seemingly magical new invention at home most evenings and not attending the movies. The Ten Commandments would set a trend of epic films that would carry on till the early 60's- Ben Hur, Spartacus, Lawrence of Arabia, etc, in efforts to draw audiences to the movies once more.I don't know if it's the bombastic music, the script, but this movie always gets to me, especially in certain scenes. The most moving scenes for me include: 1)Moses' biological mother Yochabed and the adoptive mother the queen mother Bithia confront..."I gave him life" says Yochabed. "I gave him love," says the Queen..."when he cried did you comfort him ? When he was hurt did you ache for him ?." "Yes," says his mother, "I ached for him." While a lot of the dialog can seem pretentious, Shakespearean, flowery and uber-poetic ("His name will live beyond the pyramids..etc" many scenes move you through its sheer drama. It seems old-fashioned now, but back then it packed quite a punch. I also love the scene in which Moses, upon discovering his roots as Hebrew/slave, and openly declares his intentions of freeing them to the Pharaoh in front of the entire court, the Pharao dramatically banishes him from his realm and from history. The Parting of the Red Sea is always intensely moving, as is the scene in which the Pharaoh arms himself and his minions and goes after the slaves. I've always thought that, as long as this movie is, it doesn't satisfy an engaged audience as a "complete" movie. Those familiar with Exodus, will realize that in the final portions of the movie, time is fast-forwarded. Directly after Ramses and Nefertiri are defeated ("His God IS God") the film jumps to the creation of the 10 Commandments and the Calf Worship/Orgy Scene. All this happens rather quickly and then again jumps forward to the time Moses is about to die and ordains Joshua to lead what remains of the Hebrews into the Promised Land. The best part of this movie is not so much the accuracy of biblical narrative (though there is tinkering with the text)but the in-depth, psychological portrait and character development in the characters of Moses, Nefertiri and Ramses. Now, Ramses was a true figure (both in the Bible and in history) but this Nefertiri is a total fabrication. The love triangle was an element used to "spice up" an otherwise religious tale. Ramses is possessive of Nefertiri and jealous of Moses' triumphs as Prince and the fact that the old Pharaoh favors him as the next Pharaoh over even his own son. The fact that Moses loves Nefertiri, who is brutally passionate in her love for him (she kills Memnet the handmaiden who breaks the news of Moses' Hebrew origin) adds to the spice. He later loses love for her when he meets with Sephora (Yvonne De Carlo who would later star as Lily Munster from The Munsters in the 60's). Nefertiri, a fine character dramatically-wise, loses her own love for Moses when he spurns her and is even responsible for the death of her first born son. She is so consumed by hatred now that she wants to see Moses blood in Ramses' sword. We know it's on account of the bitterness she feels of being rejected by the man she adored and loved at one time in her life. A great film, and look forward to seeing it next year, next Easter.</fullReview>

The screenplay is so over-done, you fall down laughing in places that are supposed to be dead serious. The scene where Ramses talks to Dathan (Edward G. Robinson) about Moses is a camp classic. Yul Brynner steals every scene he is in. He doesn't even have to talk. Check out the scene where his servants dress him up to go chariot riding after the recently departed Jews. As the narrator intones "Again Pharoah's heart was hardened." He stands there showing off his amazingly buff body as his men fasten on his armour. Neferteri says "Bring me back the blood of Moses on this sword." Ramses gives her a dirty look and says "I will-to mingle with your own." Ouch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ten Commandments/1956/****Main Stars: Charlton Heston Yul Brynner Edward G. RobinsonCecil B. DeMille's classic masterpiece The Ten Commandments is the best biblical movie epic of all time. Or at least one of the best. It may not be AMAZING! But it was still EXCELLENT and an awesome and powerful movie epic! I watch it every year when broadcasted on the ABC channel every Easter season. It is usually broadcasted on the eve of Easter just like this year. And yes, I am currently writing this review on April 17, 2006 and yes, Easter Sunday was yesterday but it will be the Easter season through not only April but some of May. So it will not go away for a while. This is a remembered film and a film that will remain a classic. It may have not had the spectacular acting I was waiting for but still the movie I guess would overthrow it with how excellent it was! And the casting was a little off but that's okay because I'm not that type of person that judges the movie on its casting. So what remains is the acting part. Charlton Heston seemed to be the most convincing at the acting playing the deep, booming voiced Moses who will lead the Israelites from Egypt since they were enslaved there. I just love the scene when Moses separates the water to let the Israelites go through while The Pharaoh's (Yul Brynner's) men are trapped behind the fire of God. Then they are able to get through but Moses then has the power to let the water settle back and all the Pharaoh's men drown that were in the water. The Pharaoh is angry and returns back to his queen. Before he shall swipe at her, he has to show Moses' blood on the sword to her. She's disappointed. "You couldn't even kill him??" she says in a she-would-probably-be-able-to-do-it-herself voice. Yes?, the film seems almost interminable and pretty much wastes your night because the film started at 7:00 p.m. and ended at 11:40 p.m. ABC is probably the worst station to broadcast a movie that long with all their commercials every five seconds. It completely ruins the film. The film is too much of a classic to be interrupted. Obviously ABC cares more about money than anything broadcasting people's commercials that are extremely unnecessary just to get a million dollars even though their company is already billions of dollars worth. They made even more from all the billions of people watching the film in their homes on Easter Eve. So every Easter season I watch more and more of this film more closely just to see what I missed the first times I've seen it. It seems I've missed a lot knowing that I really don't know it all from beginning to end since the commercials get me off track and it is such a long film to remember. One character I do and always will remember is the chubby, annoying gangster Edward G. Robinson playing the nosy, in-your-face Dathan, one of the Pharaoh's assistants. Then there are the women that Moses encounters over the journey through the desert that seem to be all over him and giggling like teenage girls today. Really, I don't think girls were like that BACK THEN. But now they would be. So there are some anachronisms for you. Another anachronism is when Moses is on top of the rock in the village of where the people are worshipping the golden calf. You see him on top of the rock wearing a watch. Okayyyy, I don't think the years before Christ contained market persons selling watches. Really I don't. Maybe it was something that looked like a watch. It looked just like one. You check it out. So, yes the film contains errors here and there as all films do. But look on the entertainment, compelling side. And look at the religious story. It is all very interesting. Look at the acting which wasn't all that spectacular. The film cost a lot to make, no doubt, no doubt AT ALL! The film was fake at parts but hey the year is 1956, what do you expect other than effects that look like they're drawn into the screen or stop motion or even the green screen that wasn't as technological as they are now. The film still was very impressive showing the pure water turn red, hail fall down, locusts around. The conflict between the Pharaoh and Moses and the question that asks what the Pharaoh is going to do and how he will treat Moses when he catches him, if he does at all. Then the story and what is the point? What does this movie tell you? Well, there is a LOT of things going on in the film but the main thing you have to concentrate on is the Israelite slaves being freed from Egypt which Moses obviously does succeed in. The Israelite slaves then act very inappropriately and start worshipping the golden calf idol. Guess who egged them on into doing that? Stupid Dathan, Edward G. Robinson, led them into worshipping it when Moses supposedly wasn't there anymore. No he was on top of Mount Sinai saying to God that he was trying to lead the slaves up to the top of it. God then told him the people are worshipping the golden calf. He then gave Moses the Ten Commandments that will forbid all wrongdoings and sins and tell not of worshipping gold. It instead tells, You will believe in one true God and not have any other gods besides me. Awesome it was! And still that one line stands out at the very end, "Go!" says Moses, "Go and preach to the people and teach them!" "WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN, WHAT SHALL BE DONE!" Movie directed by Cecil B. DeMille.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*******WARNING****** May contain spoilers. Even with Edward G Robinson going into "gangster mode" while delivering his lines, now and then, I still love this movie...sure, it's Biblically inaccurate, etc. etc. We have the obligatory Hollywood chaste love story between Nefretiri and Moses, plus one triangle with Rameses. Make that TWO triangles, when Sephora enters the picture. And, it turns soap-operaish when the bitchy Nefretiri ends up in forced-marriage to Snidely Whiplash (Rameses). And everyone talks and looks like either an American or a Brit. And, Vincent Price, fine actor that he was, is misplaced as Baca. He's probably too old for the part, even if his great height hints at physical prowess. And, his acting leads us to believe that old Vinny will morph into The Mummy at any moment, wreaking havoc on the Treasure City and making Sethi rue the day he disturbed the tombs of his forefathers!! Still, there's much to like here. I enjoyed Heston's acting in this very much, even tho many people are left cold by his performance. Debra Paget's performance as Lilia is quite fine, too. Some of the sets are so elegantly diginified that I wonder if Anne Baxter (Nefretiri) may have brought in her granddad to design some of them. Yul Brenner delivers a fine performance, too. Many Hollywood guys would have really hammed it up, but Brenner's Rameses always strikes the right note, even if some of his lines are substandard. Anne Baxter is still the star of this movie for me, though, since she's sooooo sexy. I felt I was giving way to a naughty indulgence by falling in lust with Nefretiri while watching a Biblical epic. Her eyes are captivating, her voice lower than Lauren Bacall's, and her movements are like watching a ballerina glide across the stage. Plus, she just wants what she wants, as a spoiled child would. We men in the audience want to give her anything her heart desires. But, alas, that's not to be; she can't marry Moses. We feel bad for the spoiled girl throughout, even when she's fabulously wealthy and Queen of the most powerful nation on earth, maybe because Moses our hero, once loved her. Judith Anderson's Memnet &amp; Cedric Hardwicke's Sethi are SO good, you almost think they're in another film, they so outclass the younger actors. Those old Brit, Shakespeare alumnus guys are still some of the best around. And They Didn't Even Have To Attend The FLAWLESS Actor's Studio!! Even tho most of TTC's special effects are so dated, the actors made you believe that they were actually happening, so they still work for me, most of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know why 10 Commandments rates so high. It's got nice background sets, full color, and nifty special effects - at least for it's time. But when it comes to what really counts, this film falls way short. The acting is terrible. And the dialogue is extremely hammy. Watching 10 Commandments feels like you're watching a stage play. The film is also about two hours too long - if you're having problems with insomnia, I suggest watching this film. The director could've worked on authenticity a bit better. The setting feels nothing like the Egypt during the biblical times. The colors are too exaggerated and the set pieces look fake. For some reason Ten Commandments kept reminding me of Gone With the Wind, another terrible film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overlook the '56 vintage; suspend your disbelief. This is still an achievement worth a watch. Viewing The Ten Commandments back to back with another excursion into ancient Egypt, namely Cleopatra, I was struck by how very much better this one is. Both films are pumped up mammoths, but De Mille pulls it off, where Cleo flounders and sinks. The casting is critical. The American actors easily outdo the British ones, Harrison, Burton and Taylor. Let's face it. Heston is Moses, Brynner is the Pharaoh. All the other men, as well as the women, are excellent impersonations, especially Yvonne de Carlo, even Edward G Robinson, and an unrecognisable Vincent Price. Compared with the spectacular scenes and scenery the script and the plot, although oddly disjointed, seem unimportant.Presumably hardly anyone takes the story seriously these days, but so what ? As filmed, it casts more than half an eye on the American myth, of freedom from harmless old George III, while retaining slavery for Africans, which is muddled and confusing. Never mind. The Egyptians were proto-Darwinians, who saw man as closely related to the animal kingdom. Moses, the Pharaoh for several years, was more of an Egyptian than a Hebrew, who decided to replace the many hybrid animal gods with a single dictatorial sun-god. This incensed the local priests who kicked him out of Egypt, and told him to take his friends with him. They survived, destroyed 6 or 7 other tribes who were living in the surrounding area, and ethnically cleansed them out of the way. Then they invented a lot of miracles and propaganda stories, making them feel good. The feel-good feeling is transmitted by this film, and it sure is impressive and entertaining, even 60 years after it was assembled. I was going to give it 7 stars, but can't really give it less than 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big performances, rich sets and costumes, a satisfying epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ten Commandments has a feeling of profundity to it. The film-makers treat it as a big, sweeping, meaningful story and so it comes across with that tone. I'm not religious but it doesn't really matter, I'm impressed with Moses and his transformation. And I feel humbled when God is on screen (either hearing his rumbling voice or seeing his fire or extraordinary powers) even though I don't really believe in him. Movies ask you to go on a journey with them and plot holes and inconsistencies are less important than a sincere effort to share a vision.The movie deservedly won an Oscar for visual effects. They are dated in many ways but they're still effective. It doesn't have to look real, it just has to be consistent with the world of the movie it's in and take hold of your imagination. The effects are exciting to look at and impressive for the time in which they were made. The stand-out parts would be the parting of the sea which is quite an epic thing to see and when God etches out the 10 commandments in stone using bolts of fire. It made me curious how they did it. In any case, the effects feel big, they're outside in wide open locations. That gives them grandeur.Cecil B. Demille does well at capturing the large sets, costumes and performances. They aren't wasted. However, the movie could have been even greater with bolder direction. He lacks a personal style. The camera rarely moves. There are such powerful tools to be found in using angles, close-ups, long panning shots, contrast between foreground and background objects, shots which suddenly reveal a vast panorama. Creative unexpected ways of filming that heighten emotion or drama. But these aren't used nearly to the degree that they could be. The movie feels a bit safe. I suppose it does give it a kind of neutral sturdiness which suits its grandness and scope.Yul Brynner is commanding as Rameses. He is firm in his beliefs and decisions. He actually comes out likable in many ways because of his consistency. He doesn't appear angry but merely determined to achieve what he thinks is best. He doesn't easily back down and explains why he does things his way. He makes some good points against Moses. He is sceptical about God and Moses' power and that's certainly a healthy sentiment. I liked Anne Baxter as Nefretiri. Perhaps it's an over-the- top performance but it suits this over-the-top movie. You believe in her love of Moses and dislike of Rameses. She seems quite sexual and passionate and she's also very persuasive - she adds a lot of energy to the movie.Charlton Heston gives a dignified performance as Moses. You sense he always cared about the people of Egypt, willing to compromise the system to do the right thing. After he sees God, he's overcome by the need to do God's work. You sense he has become a vessel, he now only cares about being God's hand. There is kindness and poetry and wisdom in the way he then speaks. Overall the script is really interesting with lots of clever lines. Some of it is funny as well. Vincent Price and Edward G. Robinson are also good in their parts.I enjoyed The Ten Commandments for its grand story told in earnest. It spares no expense when it comes to scenery, costumes, visual effects and stars (it was the most expensive film made at the time). The dialogue both sounds like the style of the Bible but also feels modern somehow. So many of the lines have some kind of punch or poison to them.There are flaws in the morality of Moses' journey. God does many questionable things that can't have been the best solution to the problems at hand. There is too much weight given to prophecy and what people say. It's a misconception that something written is somehow more likely to come true. There are times when the message of the film is unclear. The people on the exodus arbitrarily become gluttonous, lustful sinners when Moses is off talking to God for 40 days. Why couldn't he let them know how long he would be or communicate on his progress? Why are the people so sheep-like and 1-dimensional?The Ten Commandments only lacks a few things that prevent it from being great. It doesn't have a gripping emotional climax. Moses changes but he is slave to a force we only indirectly see. He does not have enough moments of humanity or vulnerability. The movie doesn't fully resonate with modern sentiments because the tale deals too much in punishment and revenge. God is presented as a tyrant who causes pain to encourage change rather than simply directly freeing the slaves. And it lacks a style of its own. There are a handful of really cool images but otherwise it looks like Hollywood.Still, it's a big movie and it succeeds in what it tries to do. I enjoyed all of it even if parts of the plot were a bit frustrating. It's a fun, rewarding epic film to watch and it's not every day you get to hear God's voice or see such epic, biblical events happening right in front of your eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular and reverent Biblical epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1956, "The Ten Commandments" is Cecil B. DeMille's cinematic account of Moses delivering the Israelites from bondage to Egypt, as chronicled in Exodus. Charlton Heston stars as Moses and Yul Brynner as Rameses, who later becomes Pharaoh. Anne Baxter co-stars as the beautiful but conniving Princess Nefretiri. Yvonne De Carlo plays Moses' wife while John Derek plays Joshua and Debra Paget his wannabe babe. Edward G. Robinson plays the traitorous Hebrew Dathan while Vincent Price plays a slave driver.The screenplay fills in the holes of the biblical account with some fictional characters and events, like Nefretiri and Moses' mother almost getting mowed over by a colossal block of stone. There are also some changes in the story, like Joshua seeking and finding Moses in the desert after decades and the way the LORD enacts judgment on rebels after the golden calf incident wherein the script borrows from the account of Korah's rebellion (Numbers 16).The sets, costuming, locations and special effects are colorful and spectacular while the drama is surprisingly compelling and moving. You can nitpick this or that, like Heston's stilted delivery after Moses becomes the promised deliverer and God speaking in Old English, but why bother when the film is so entertaining and even inspiring? The filmmakers used a lot of imagination in recreating what it was like for the Egyptians in the palaces and the Israelites in slavery. The sequences showing the Hebrews moving the aforementioned blocks of stone are awesome; as is the scene where Moses supervises the erecting of a towering obelisk. Brynner is outstanding as Rameses; he made baldness cool. As for women, Baxter, De Carlo and Paget are stunning, as are numerous peripheral cuties.The movie runs 220 minutes and was shot in Southern California, Egypt and Arizona.GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rousing Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1950's was a decade home to many epics. Perhaps one of the best ones produced was 1956's The Ten Commandments. This film fits the definition of an epic very well. It will fill you up with awe, with amazement, and with wonder due to the use of gigantic set pieces, colorful costume designs, a bombastic score, and storytelling that many of us know about (especially if you're from Christianity or Jewish heritage). The film runs at a lengthy three hours and forty minutes, which is common for epics during the golden age of epics. Despite the lengthy film, I felt the movie had a good pace to it. It did not seem like a long movie, and I was almost disappointed when the credits appeared. When that happens in a 3+ hour film, you know you have a good film on your hands.This film is based off historical events or to be more specific, the tale of Moses from his birth to his death. In Ancient Egypt, Pharoah Ramses I decreed all newborn Hebrew males shall die. However, a newborn male named Moses (Charlton Heston) was cast away in the Nile in a reed basket. He was saved by pharaoh's daughter, Bithiah (Nina Foch), and he grew up in court of the pharaoh's brother, Seti (Cedric Hardwicke). Moses made a name to himself and became a favorite to take the throne after Seti. But once Moses's heritage is revealed, everything changes. Moses is cast from Egypt, where he marries and raises a family. He is commanded by God to return to Egypt so he can free the Hebrew people from slavery. However, Seti's son, Rameses (Yul Brynner) does all he can to stop Moses.There are just many scenes in the movies to goggle at. I am very impressed on how the story was told, and I can understand why the movie became a classic. Some of my favorite scenes are the parting of the Red Sea, where Moses splits the Red Sea so his people can cross the sea and be saved from Rameses, who was chasing them down. Another powerful scene I loved was when Yahweh was speaking to Moses on the top of Mount Sinai, issuing Moses the Ten Commandments while all his people were sinning at the base of the mountain. Just seeing God as a ball of fire, speaking with a commanding holy voice gave me the chills. Despite this being a film released in 1956, I believe the special effects hold up fairly well. The parting of the Red Sea is incredible, and it is amazing how that scene was done without the use of any CGI.I have previously reviewed a movie from Cecil B. DeMille, which was released nine years previously in 1947 called Unconquered. That movie showed DeMille had a good hand in making entertaining epics. He really succeeds on the grand scale, as proved by the success of this film. The acting was also consistent and everyone seemed to have a fun time. Sometimes the acting would be downright silly, but there is no denying the fun the cast had. Charlton Heston is no stranger to epics, and I loved his performance here as Moses. Maybe towards the end when he becomes a whole new person he got a little silly, but overall he did a good job. Yul Brynner is good as Moses's fiercest rival, Rameses, He created a memorable villain, who feels betrayed by his father that he would give power to Moses and not him. Anne Baxter does a good job as Nefretiri who was Mose's love interest. Baxter did good, but sometimes her seductiveness would feel out of place in the film. Finally, I must mention Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, the man who was in charge of the slaves. I felt he gave a light, comedic touch to a man in what otherwise would be a sinister character.Overall, The Ten Commandments is a great epic that holds up very well, nearly sixty years after its original release. The film does justice to the story, as told in the Bible. It's obvious the film takes a stance against slavery, and its fun to see Moses outdo Rameses, The special effects are pretty cool, but get ready to be blown away by the Red Sea scene. This sweeping epic is a grand, fun movie. Not only does it enlighten people on the story of Moses and what he did for his people, but it also is fun, silly, and entertaining. The movie does a little into stretching the imagination, but its fun to watch and one of the best epics of all time.My Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close to the Bible lesson and a true to scale epic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the phenomenal aspects of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt was the sheer scale of the event. They were two to three million people (based on Ex. 12:37-38). They had many herds of cattle, flocks of sheep and goats, household belongings, and "the spoils of Egypt." To move such a mass of humanity and possessions across a desert to an unknown land was incomprehensible to the people then ? Hebrews and Egyptians alike. And it must seem such to us today. That is an important aspect of the story, and its powerful lesson ? that man alone could not achieve such a thing. Only God could do it. Any movie of the exodus that doesn't capture that sense misses the very essence of the story. Few films made to date have even tried to do that. The exception, and the model to judge all exodus films by, is this one. Cecil B. DeMille, remade his 1923 silent film and added 1 ? hours to the "The Ten Commandments" film of 1956. It stands alone having captured a sense of the awe of the exodus. The movie was shot in Egypt and on Paramount sets in Hollywood. The vast scenes of Hebrew slaves working in the brick pits in Egypt gives a real sense of the enslavement of the Hebrew people more than 3,000 years ago. The scenes of building the city of Rameses and the hordes leaving the great city are spectacular. The sets for the elaborate Egyptian courts, temples, locales, and buildings are painstakingly reproduced from years of research and effort. The special effects are outstanding. Here, they show some of the signs of God's power. The film has just a few of the plagues and events during the exodus, but they are done most convincingly. Instead of swarms of flies and locusts, a famine and plague of frogs, this film has a tremendous storm of sizable hailstones that then burn with fire on the ground. The turning of the waters of the Nile into blood and some lesser scenes of special effects are all very good. The column of fire that blocks the Egyptians is spectacular. And no other efforts have come close to the fantastic scene of the parting of the Red Sea. The walls of water on either side actually appear as though strong winds are pushing and holding them back. The Bible says that the Ten Commandments were "written by the finger of God," and the scenes with Moses on the top of Mt. Sinai show just that. Fingers of fire come out of the whirling column of fire that is God, in electrifying shots that burn the words into the rock. The later earthquake that swallows up Dathan and others who lead the rebellion against Moses and God, is excellent. The special effects, size of scale, authenticity of the land, sets and costumes all add to the greatness of this film. But it has much more, including an accurate and faithful recounting from the Bible of the exodus and this key part of Israelite history. And, central to that is the Passover and understanding it. I've watched half a dozen other films about Moses and the exodus, and don't recall more than cursory mention of the Passover in a couple of them. Yet, the Passover was such a crucial event in Jewish history (and Christian symbolism), that it must be the heart of any story about the exodus. But, as with any film of such epic proportions, this one isn't perfect. It is missing one aspect that is important to understanding Jewish history. That is the scouting of the Promised Land just a few months into the exodus. God was ready then and there to lead the people on their conquest of the land and its people. But the Hebrews rebelled and wouldn't trust God to lead them. So, he condemned them to the 40 years of wandering in the desert until all those over age 20 had died. More than 30 incidents of God's power during the exodus are covered in the early books of the Bible. All of these were preceded by the people grumbling, complaining or rebelling against Moses and God. To Jews and Christians alike, this is an important lesson from our past to remember. The fiction account of Moses growing up in the royal household is as possible and believable as any other. And, it's certainly entertaining. Wouldn't a boy in the Pharaoh's household learn physical skills and the art of warfare? Wouldn't such a youth be highly regarded by Pharaoh and the people? Wouldn't he have female admirers? And a love interest? These things make more sense for an imaginable account of some 30 years of the life of Moses, than many other fictional accounts. This film is faithful in its use of names from the Bible. It is accurate with other names that aren't given, from history and/or tradition. Seti I is the first Pharaoh in the film, and Rameses II is his son (played by Yul Bryner). His real mother is Jochabed (spelled Yochabel in the film), and pharaoh's daughter who adopts Moses is Bithiah. The character of Joshua is much more prevalent in this film than in the Bible, but here he is in the forefront for a romantic sub-story. Nefretiri (played by Anne Baxter) is a fictitious character as the early love interest of Moses (played by Charlton Heston). The huge supporting cast all excel. The detail and realistic recreation of costumes, uniforms, dress styles, and other aspects of ancient Egypt are outstanding. All the production aspects of the film are exceptional. The musical score rounds out the accolades for this great classic film.</fullReview>

Especially liked the actor igra6 let them mock and looked, but all the movements and facial expressions were clear, without unnecessary movements. And what there were decorations and scenes, and some extras! No schedule does not replace it. The special effects are not cheap, he worked until the last detail, and let the technology of the time, but everyone is very clear. It is accustomed to the experience of Moses, his ups and downs, it was fine. The actor playing perfectly, and even though he probably had such a life, Chesney, hardworking, fair person, that has not changed even expulsion, except for the better. During the film suddenly began to play in my head the song Louis Armstrong "let my people go" and suddenly I began to realize what she had in mind translated some words to remember, he immediately thought of slavery in America and learned that the song sung long to Armstrong, even as slaves, blacks in America. This caused me such understanding of morality, which to me did not reach before. The film changed my view a bit, and thinking in a positive way, and now I have a different attitude to any cult type Zolotova calf. In general, a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>memories of red seas and crazy Golden parties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen The Ten Commandments, in full, since I was a kid. And yet it's a testament to DeMille's skills as a filmmaker in crafting this massive, elephantine testament to the... Old Testament that this can stick in someone's mind so strongly. I've seen bits and pieces over the years and it's questionable whether all the visual effects hold up - or some of the very BIG moments in Heston and Brynner's performances. But it's hard to take out of the mind those moments of the plague, when the water turns to a red that you could only see in movies where the technicolor was done just as it was then, with those processes and treatments. Also the scene where (I'm not spoiling this, it's the Torah/Bible people) Ramses' son is killed, that really stuck out to me as a kid. Something about that, the way it just... happens in the room and the characters have to deal with it, and Moses keeps going on about how horrible it is and it must stop. That can mess with a kid's head.In a way the spectacle of it, how BIG the whole darn thing is, sticks with you the most - and naturally, it's a big spectacle, one of the largest in a career of big ones for DeMille and this was the one he left his career on. But that entire sequence following the Jews escaping from the Egyptians after going through the parting of the seas... as they party and revel and go into total debauchery before the Golden Calf, that's really powerful. In a way that's much more striking and meaningful than some of the special effects of large performances or, yes, stilted dialog. It's seeing how people can act when all boundaries are put aside that makes such an impression really. And then of course the commandments appear and by then the movie is over.But if only for about, oh, twenty or thirty minutes of this four-hour Sperm Whale of a movie truly great filmmaking, bravado and bravura and balls for the period of 1956, are on display. The rest of it is okay too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BRINGING SUCH AN epic to the screen and doing any justice would surely be a monumental task. It would be a crap shoot for the studio that made the picture and obviously guys like Adplph Zukor and Jesse Lasky at Paramount Pictures were gamblers. As it turned out, in the hands of Director, Cecil B. De Mille, it proved to be a sure thing.PEOPLE OF ALL faiths within the Judeo-Christian traditions lined up to see it at premium exclusive showing prices. In our case, we went on a field trip from St. Theodore Elementery School to see it. Making our pilgrimage from the South Side location to McVicker's Theatre, 21 W. Madison Street in Chicagp's Loop. The year was early 1957 and we were in the 5th Grade.ALTHOUGH THE FILM is shown regularly on network television on a yearly basis (around Easter/Passover time), and we have seen it several times, it does remain a big-screen picture. Its special effects, such as they are, have a much greater effect on viewers.A VERITIBLE ARMY of actors, cameramen and technicians were assembled. The roll call of those starring or featured in this film reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood. Heading up the cast, of course, is Charlton Heston along with Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne De Carlo, Debra Paget, John Derek, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Nina Foch, Martha Scott, Judith Anderson, Vincent Price, John Carradine, and tons of other names that you may or may not recognize.AS AN INTRODUCING sidebar to this story, we recall that Charlton Heston stated during interview that the role cost him many invitations to cocktail parties and other get togethers. He said that no one wanted to have Moses as a guest.WE FOUND IT to be very convincing at ten years old and still find it to be so today, in our 7th Decade on Planet Earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeMille Saves the Best for Last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ten Commandments (1956)**** (out of 4) Cecil B. DeMille's final film was this epic remake of his very own 1923 film. The film tells the story of Moses (Charlton Heston) who narrowly avoided death as a baby only to grow up to be the next king of Egypt to simply walk away and into slavery to try and save his people. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is without question one of the most popular movies ever made and there's also no doubt that it has flaws scattered throughout. With that said, it's really impossible to pick on the flaws simply because there's so many masterful things going on here. DeMille was always a director to take things to the extreme and there's no question that he went all out there because every single frame just has so much going on in it that your eyes are constantly busy scanning the frame. Quite often your mind is going to be blown because of the wonderful images that you're looking at. Watching the scenes with hundreds, if not thousands, of people are just downright incredible. There are many other great sequences including the now legendary finale where the ten commandments are written into stone. The effect is still quite powerful today. This of course follows the sequence where the sea is parted and there's no doubt that this here is one of the most magical scenes in film history. Another major plus are the terrific performances by the all-star cast including Heston turning in one of his greatest performances. Yul Brynner makes for a terrific villain as does Edward G. Robinson and Vincent Price. Anne Baxter, Yvonne De Carlo, John Derek, Nina Foch, John Carradine and Cedric Hardwicke are also excellent in their roles. Again, there are flaws throughout the film but the overall effect and impact of the film can't be denied. DeMille's most impressive job is that he manages to keep the film moving and entertaining at nearly four-hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Hollywood extravaganza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the biblical story of Moses, Cecil B. DeMille has created one of the great Hollywood extravaganzas. The story starts with the people of Israel suffering under slavery in Egypt. The Pharoah orders all Jewish newborns to be killed after a sign in the stars predicting the birth of the leader who will lead his people out of slavery. Widowed princess Bithiah finds the baby floating down the Nile as a gift from the god. The baby would grow up to be Prince Moses (Charlton Heston) while he competes with Prince Rameses (Yul Brynner) for the favor of the Pharoah. From there to when the Jews are finally set free to finally end their wondering in the desert, this is an old fashion Hollywood big budget drama.It's obvious that the production is huge. The scale of the sets are grand. The effects are great for its times especially the parting of the Red Sea. Charlton Heston plays the moral hero to the fullest. It's old fashion and there is no subtlety. Yul Brynner plays the jealous Rameses brilliantly. Edward G. Robinson is simply the best as the corrupting Dathan. For being an iconic movie and such a well made movie, it deserves its place in movie history.</fullReview>

The story line, the effects and acting were all top notch. Also the cinematography for this movie is out standing. One of the things that is so great about The Ten Commandments is although it is a movie version, it is very close to the real story in the bible for those that believe. The story line is good Vs evil but it is very encouraging in many ways and shows you that no matter what may be against you, if God is on your side, you cannot be defeated.

		<shortDescription>Epic For The Ages!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a story that will fill you with awe, with wonder, with such amazement. The Ten Commandments is an adventure-filled epic that is incredibly entertaining. Two things go against this movie and they are age and length. The film came out nearly sixty years ago so it has that old-time feel. But the special effects are great and do I dare say that they hold up relatively well today. The length could be problematic since it's almost 4 hours long, but I daresay the story will have enough here to hold your attention.Cecil B. DeMille directed an epic story based on the tale of Moses. We see the rise of Moses under the guidance of the Egyptian Pharaoh, Seti. But once word gets out of his Hebrew heritage, he gets cast out. But the Lord God commands Moses to return to Egypt in order to free his people from bondage.The film has wonderful acting from practically everyone. Charlton Heston in his first epic role does a great job as Moses. I loved his character transformations from beginning to end. Anne Baxter does a great job as Nefertiti, the girl in love with Moses. Edward G. Robinson does a great job as the guy essentially in charge of the slaves.Overall, this film truly defines the meaning of epic. The historical accuracy may or may not be correct, but there is still a great story being told. The special effects only enhances it especially when Moses meet God. The costume designs are great and it has a great, bombastic score. A bit lengthy, but still a wonderful epic based off a well-known story. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Biblical epic, good for anyone to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching The Ten Commandments, I repeatedly thought, "they just don't make movies like this anymore." The huge sets and details are great, especially for their time (consider that this was made all the way back in 1956). The fact that the movie is old and made in a different period of time should not discourage you from watching it (just remember to make plenty of time in your schedule - It's almost 4 hours long). The movie does not exactly follow the Biblical text in Exodus, but it is similar. The first half of the movie can be a little slow - Most of my favorite moments (like the parting of the Red Sea and God giving Moses the Ten Commandments) are in the second half of the movie. This is a great movie to watch, especially near Passover.</fullReview>

After some Chatter about Source Material, if that wasn't Enough, there is this Screen Credit..."Those who see this Motion Picture - Produced and Directed by Cecil B. Demille - Will make a Pilgrimage over the very ground that Moses trod more than 3,000 years ago". You can't get more Self Important than that. It also Begs the Question...Is it better than the Book? This is a must see for all Movie Lovers and it is an Entertainment of the First Order. There are many Highlights, including the Sets, Costumes, SFX, Music, and just the Sheer Bigness and Audacity of it All. It is Iconic and irresistible and the Four Hour Running Time Passes Over with Ease and is as Smooth as "That Fabric, they call it Silk". A Fitting Metaphor for this Movie, it Looks so Inviting that you may want to run your hand across the Screen just to Feel the Texture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisiting The Ten Commandments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had been about 7 years since I've seen The Ten Commandments, prior to watching it on ABC this Saturday evening. Certainly I remembered many of the iconic sequences, such as the parting of the Red Sea and Moses' encounter with God on Mount Sinai, yet the experience was very fresh.The plot of The Ten Commandments should be familiar to most modern audiences. Though, for those who are unaware, it tells the story of Moses: a Hebrew born to slaves who is rescued and raised as a prince in Ancient Egypt. As he learns of his heritage, he ultimately sets out on a mission to liberate his people from their rule under the oppressive pharaoh and his half-brother Ramses II. The film is approximately 3 hours and 40 minutes long. With commercials included on ABC's annual broadcast, I had spent about 4 hours and 45 minutes on my couch watching the television screen. Surprisingly, none of this took a toll on my interest in the film. I've always had a strong, sentimental love for epics, so this should really come as no surprise. However, DeMille really knows how to keep his audience engaged. Never in the film does a scene drag. While the film is admittedly rather campy and remains on familiar sets, it is very much in motion. A new detail in the plot emerges frequently and DeMille's narrative is extremely easy to understand.Well, for the most part, that is. What I had noticed more so in my viewing this time around was the dialogue and its very...formal nature. All the actors use larger-than-life words and speak with no rhetorical devices to spare. Metaphors, similes, puns ? this film has got it all. At times ? particularly in scenes where Ramses is longing for Nefretiri's affection ? you'll be amazed how these actors come off speaking with straight faces. While the dialogue can be funny at times, it can also certainly be repetitive. At times, this is for obvious stylistic purposes, such as "So it is written, so it shall be done", which plays a big role in the film's final message. Other times, the repetition can be exhausting. If I had a penny for every time a character said "Bondage"....The dialogue can definitely prove to be more complicated for younger audiences. Though, the point of what the actors are trying to convey often comes across through their actions. After all, from what I noticed, the film is as much a visual experience as it is based in dialogue. The characters' emotions and actions really move the narrative forward ? especially Ramses', whose jealousy over Moses is conveyed so well by Yul Brynner.The visuals in The Ten Commandments are quite lovely. The film has some top-notch sets, although many are re-used in various sequences throughout the film. The desert landscapes, grand Egyptian cities and shots of the Nile River really take audiences back to Ancient Egypt and are extremely vibrant in life and colour. One can particularly notice this vibrancy with modern HD broadcasts of the film, as I had seen on ABC. Not only are they colourful, but the sets are so full of life. There are numerous extras all dressed up in carefully- crafted costumes each doing their own action on-set. They are all real, too, mind you. Remember: there was no CGI in 1956. The film definitely takes you back not only to ancient Egypt, but to a time in Hollywood history in which sets were truly spectacle. Seldom will you see a film of this scale in the 21st century.The Ten Commandments does make use of special effects to enhance its settings. For the most part, they're outdated, but what can you expect? Again, it was 1956 when this was made. Moses' staff turning into a snake comes off as cartoonish and even the iconic parting of the Red Sea is unconvincing. The problem with older films like The Ten Commandments and their primitive special effects is their heavy reliance on them. The film's narrative is dependent on translating grand spectacles and has to indulge in exploiting special effects to a high degree. Ultimately, the more primitive special effects, the more dated the film is. Many shots can prove to be an eyesore for modern audiences, but I never found them distracting. If anything, they were rather neat. I always find it interesting to see how filmmakers make the most of the available technology during their time period, and The Ten Commandments did an excellent job. The film even managed to gain an Academy Award for its efforts in visual effects.Also, not all of the artificial visuals are an eyesore. For instance, when Moses turns the water of Egypt into blood, my mind is still blown as it was 7 years ago.Accompanying all the visuals is a score composed by the critically acclaimed Elmer Bernstein. All in all, the music he has composed for the film defines all that is epic. It certainly makes use of a surround sound system in your home theatre. Though, I found that watching it this time around it was rather repetitive. Quite often the same music was used repetitively, with slight modifications. Nevertheless, the soundtrack definitely manipulated my emotions at points, especially during the opening credits ? the chill that went down my spine during then was overwhelming, to say the least.All in all, The Ten Commandments is just as spectacular as I remembered it so many years ago. I've noticed some flaws during my second viewing, but this is normal with most films.It's ultimately triumphant where it truly counts, as it has gorgeous visuals and a truly compelling narrative that makes the most out of its nearly 4 hour running time.I highly recommend the film to audiences of all ages. Although it's flawed, it is nothing short of a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biblical Melodrama at its Most Memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I have not seen this film since "The Ten Commandments" was the only movie being shown in theaters during Holy Week. Despite the length of four hours, the only thing I really remember about it was the Red Sea scene, and maybe that is more because of the poster than the film. This Maundy Thursday, I decided to revisit this grand classic film, the last film of renowned director Cecil B DeMille.While I was watching, I recognized several scenes by bits and pieces only, especially in the first half before the intermission. The scenes in the second half were more memorable. This whole matter about the Egyptian princess Nefretiri (whom I am not really clear what the nature of her close relationship is to the Pharaoh Sethi was) played by a very campy Anne Baxter, I do not remember AT ALL. Maybe I was still too young back then to understand the flowery-worded melodrama involving her double-dealing character, and how she affected the relationship of Moses (an outstanding Charlton Heston) and Rameses (a believable Yul Brynner). I was touched by the sympathetic treatment the production had for Pharaoh Sethi (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) and his sister Bithiah (Nina Foch). The scene of Moses meeting his mother Yochabel (Martha Scott) was very moving. The overseers Dathan (Edward G. Robinson) and Baka (Vincent Price), were contemptible with their hammy villainy.But you can really see why this biblical epic was an instant classic back then, and up to now. The "cast of thousands" it boasts of in the poster is literally true (no computer-generated crowds back then. The sets and costumes were incredibly grand and colorful. The Oscar Award- winning visual effects (parting of the Red Sea, turning water into blood, etc...) were impressive considering that this was made back in 1956! While I am sure these effects would have been done differently with the advanced technology now, the last plague which simply depicted the Angel of Death like a green mist creeping on the floor can still elicit fear in the audience. OK, the burning bush scene could be done much better now, but the memory of seeing Moses' physical transformation when he came down from Mt. Sinai with that incredible brush-up hairstyle change could not be replicated.</fullReview>

The actor that stood out was Yul Brenner,who played the difficult role of the arrogant villain Pharoah - while Charlton Heston (that acted much better in BEN HUR) seemed to be predictably boring and robotic.Yet what actor could play Moses the great?Those that criticized the Biblical accuracy of the movie's dialog,should understand that the story line wasn't taken directly from Scripture - but from a novel.It had great special effects,with the burning bush,the ten plagues,and the Red Sea crossing,and the Finger of God writing the Ten Commandments. Most of the actresses in the movie were very beautiful- even the sub actresses.Special credit should go to the meaty dialog between the actors. The timing and the chemistry between them were incredible. This was not a "christian " movie targeted to people of faith - but to secular movie viewers, that love special effects and great acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spectacular biblical masterpiece that will always touch our hearts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I never saw this movie before until one day, at the library, I checked out a two-disc copy of this movie and I decided to watch it since I only watched the trailers and have heard that lots of people loved it as a classic masterpiece to see if I would like it as well. Then, a few days later, I became thrilled with excitement at how epic this is and I can see how lots of people considered it as a masterpiece for everyone to enjoy.Now, I want to go to the positives. First, to be honest, I never read the biblical story of Moses, but never and I mean never have I been so amazed at how faithful and very compelling the story was in this epic film. It had some very touching moments and made us understand the characters due to their interactions with each other. The characters on the whole are likable. The actors, including Cedric Hardwicke, Vincent Price, Judith Anderson, John Carradine, Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne DeCarlo and Debra Paget were very supportive with their fantastic roles, but I think that Charleton Heston makes a great Moses in his lead while Yul Brynner too gives his best performance as the sinister and cunning Ramses.It has a beautiful landscape at the mountain where the Burning Bush is and some very nice scenery and the look of Egypt and the slaves hometown was perfect and looked just the way I pictured it to be. The two strongest aspects goes to the lavishly beautiful special effects and a rousing and very original music score from the late Elmer Berstein himself. To those who don't know, Elmer Berstein did some great music for later films like The Magnificent Seven, To Kill A Mockingbird, Airplane and its sequel, Heavy Metal, Ghostbusters, The Black Cauldron, and more.Overall, I understand know that this is by no means an epic masterpiece even though it's only 220 minutes longer. I never saw the silent film (plan on seeing it someday), but at least I saw two of the later adaptations. The Dreamworks Animation version was pretty while I think that the CGI animated version was pretty mediocre. Believe it or not, but I heard news that there's gonna be another remake of The Ten Commandments and it's going to be directed by none other than Steven Spielberg himself.So, by all means, enjoy this and the traditional animated version and wait for the new remake to come. I hope it'll be as good as those two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For long, long time, I had been hearing about this movie from my family and friends who had this it. Every time they would praise it for its camera work and the hugeness of the film.This really got me excited to view this title. So I checked with my local DVD store for this movie but it wasn't available.Come Easter 2011. HBO was telecasting this film and I was so excited. I blocked the time and kept myself free to watch the movie. And it was an EXPERIENCE.Big, big canvas! I liked the movie. It was awesome. But being a film student, I watched it with a critic's mind rather than a movie buff. Of course, the camera work was amazing and it captured the grandeur of the events and situations and the characters in the movie.But what also caught my attention was that the movie had writing flaw. I don't know how many of you would agree with me. All the characters spoke in the similar fashion.In films, there are scenes and shots and counter-shots. Likewise, the characters in those scenes should be, in certain degree, in contrast with the other. This is important for dramatic situation that will make the screenplay move forward.This movie has enough drama to keep you engaged for all its 220 minutes. But being a students of films, I can't help myself but notice the weak characterization of the principal characters.I can't end my review without the mention of the most talked about, most discussed or the most read scene - the Red Sea parting scene. After watching this movie, I went on the net and goggled about this scene. It remains my favorite scene from the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film about the greatest story ever told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The epic film The Ten Commandments is directed by the legendary Cecil B. DeMille and stars Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, and Anne Baxter. The film takes place 3,000 years ago in Egypt.The film starts with the pharaoh discovering that an evil star is shining brightly which means that the Hebrew who will save the slaves has been born, so the Pharaoh decrees that every newborn must be killed. A woman named Yochabel sends her newborn son down a river in a basket so that her son will not be killed. The son is then found by the Pharaoh's sister who raises the boy, Moses, as her own son. Many years later Moses is a very successful Prince of Egypt and may even possibly become the next Pharaoh unless his cousin Rameses proves to be the better candidate. A short while later Moses discovers that he is actually a Hebrew and decides to join his people and leave the life of royalty. When the Pharaoh discovers this he outcasts his nephew and that is when the epic tale continues with Moses' meeting with God.The direction of this film was brilliant, DeMille did a great job of making this epic film feel epic. There were many beautiful shots of all the slaves doing construction and especially at the end with the parting of the Red Sea, extremely well done. Whenever God was on the screen the shots for Him were truly Godly and all the special effects for this film were truly magnificent.The acting in this film was only so-so, Charlton Heston gave a very good performance as Moses but Yul Brynner and Anne Baxter were not that great in their parts of Rameses and Nefretiri. For Brynner the whole film he acted the same, angry and cocky. There truly was no emotional change for him until slightly at the very end, but throughout the film his anger should of grown instead of staying consistent. Baxter the whole film was just in love with Moses and didn't ever portray a quality that showed why he was also attracted to her and then at the end I will not give a spoiler away but something bad happens to her and she never shows any sadness, she is just cold.A great part of the film was the score, it really worked well with the film and if one was just hearing it they would know it was for an epic film. It was perfect in all the right places and without it the film would be nowhere near the quality that it currently is.The art direction and costume design for this film was also truly perfect. It is exactly how I imagine Egypt to look in that time period and it was brilliantly done and should be a model for all other films of what great art direction and costume design should be.Overall this film is a solid 8/10, the only thing bringing it down is some of the performances. I would recommend this film to just about everyone, especially fans of the epic genre, and religious and historical films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Subtle Moment in The Ten Commandments?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moment that really comes to mind in the Ten Commandments is not one anyone else would mention. It is the moment, I believe, before Moses parts the Red Sea, and Joshua directs him where to stand for optimum effect and visibility for the Israelites. It is almost an in-joke allusion as to the role of the director in film (it may well be that, I don't believe besides the grandiose tone of his films, DeMille was entirely without a sense of humor). It also, however, is a very real moment, very ordinary, one that easily could have happened, and one that gave a remarkable sense of making the biblical spectacle something the modern viewer could actually relate to.I recently saw Part 1 of Kevin Brownlow's new documentary on DeMille, "American Epic," and it made a compelling case for that fact that while DeMille was not a revolutionary like D.W. Griffith, he knew very well how a story was to be presented, even knowing how to make a sound film that flowed while everyone else was making sound films with the pacing of a tortoise with sore legs and the mobility of a camera dipped in concrete.That genuine craftsmanship was certainly more than just there in the Ten Commandments, and one really has to confess that despite the corn and the kitsch (for example, Moses coming back from talking to the burning bush with frosted hair, presumably to either indicate the fire bleached out his do, or maybe as some indication of physical change wrought by his first encounter with "The Big Guy"), this is one well done film. I have to add, after the comment of another IMDB user about the plagues creeping one out, the Angel of Death descending on Cairo to take the first born sons coming down as a disembodied, sentient cloud of horror is most definitely neither corny or kitschy, but unsettling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Egyptian Prince, Moses (Charlton Heston), learns of his true heritage as a Hebrew and his divine mission as the deliverer of his people.Is this the greatest Biblical epic of all time? Probably. Although there are other noteworthy films, few have the sweeping range of this film, and few (if any) had the advantage of being shown on television every Easter. (Exactly what Moses has to do with Easter is open to interpretation.) Although I am typically a genre film person, particularly horror, there was plenty to like here. We have Vincent Price, Edward G. Robinson and many more great actors. Price and Robinson on screen together? Wow! Throw in Yul Brynner, and you have one heck of a setup. There must have been a lot of fun after filming finished each day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but Long, Anticlimactic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of epics: I love Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia. This epic just doesn't match these two mentioned above. While part 2 is more exciting than part 1, this part of the film also falls short of greatness for me. It is entertaining to see Moses' rebellion, but there are noticeable flaws throughout.It is easy to explain why the first "half" of the film falls flat: it primarily consists of very long exposition and a build-up to the second half of the film. The one intriguing moment of the first part of The Ten Commandments is Moses' shift from nobility to a willingness to blend in with his people (who he has just discovered are his people) as a slave. It shows qualities of a great character, but it seems to come across too quickly and without too much thought. Basically, we see only a little bit of motivation behind this very quick change within Moses' ideologies.The second half of the film shows Rameses as really dumb. Seriously, like really dumb. And as a coward, though it is not his acting that shows cowardice, but simply the writing of the film. It makes sense that Rameses is skeptical about Moses' god at first when his men are also able to change their staves into cobras, but you think he would learn by the time Moses claims God will make it hail (and it does) within the film. Nope, he still gives little explanation to why he is skeptical. Then, after agreeing to let Moses and his people go, Rameses seeks after them because it is convenient for the plot for him to become vengeful. He doesn't even get his upcommance of death; he is too much of a coward to travel into the red sea along with his men, yet the actor is so one- dimensional that it never truly comes across as cowardice.The writing is my main problem with this film. The set, the number of extras, the special effects (minus the cartoon fires) are all great and make for an intriguing epic, but this epic is somewhat boring for that which has been described above as well as the ending sequence where there is unstructured "chaos;" if the mob mentality was directed as in Metropolis it would have been fine, but the mob behavior at the end of this film seems to just be filmed as if it was b-roll footage.</fullReview>

Cecil DeMille made huge effort here, and the presence of such top-level stars as Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner make it nice to watch. But then, all those inaccuracies creep in, The Bible is left somewhere aside and alone, all the typical melodrama scenes add to the overwhelming feeling of utter silliness and way too heavy handedness. Heston is OK as Moses, he does a good job, while Brynner is Okay but way too modern. Female parts are all wooden and stifled, at least, in general, they seem to be very unnatural and false. What is always felt, is a uneasy feeling of the film not being deeply Biblical or authentic in delivery. it all seems to be a large loud but boring stage show, of 4 hours. It can be watched once and then quickly forgotten</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Across the eons of movie history, there are only a handful of films which bridge the gap between excellence and superb. This is one of them. The legendary saga is taken from various tribal beliefs, early desert texts and original books in the bible. None however are taken from ancient Egyptain scrolls as their history makes no mention that such man ever existed or any monumental events took place. Nevertheless, few audiences come to see this film for historical accuracy, instead they sit with childlike fascination at the incredible special effects seen throughout the movie. Viewing this film, "The Ten Commandments" as a child, creates awe and wonder at the possibility that such a man could have ever lived. As an adult, the film continues to fascinate us, but now its just to enjoy the excellent casting and stage performances of such screen legends as Charlton Heston as Moses, magnificent Yul Brynner as the Pharaoh, Rameses the great. There is sly and crafty Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, the overseer, handsome John Derek as Joshua and Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Sethi the I. Vincent Price is impressive as Baka, The Master Builder and John Carradine as Aaron. Seen nearly every year as repetitive as The Wizard of Oz, this movie reigns supreme as one of the few which emerged as a true Classic. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colossal biblical spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Cecil B. DeMille epic tells the story of Moses, an Egyptian prince who, after learning of his Hebrew origins, strives for the liberation of his people. Adjusted for inflation, it's one of the biggest box-office hits of all time.Clocking in at over three and a half hours, this is the sort of film that defines the term 'epic'. There's a large cast, wonderful sets and special effects galore. No doubt, this must have been mind-blowing back in 1956. Yet, the film only managed to nab one Oscar.The acting is in good hands with a large cast that's well stocked with talented actors and actresses. Charlton Heston in particular delivered a career-making performance that strangely went un-nominated for an Oscar. Other notables include Yul Brynner, Edward G. Robinson, Cedric Hardwicke and the entrancing Anne Baxter.The story is entertaining and the instances of divine intervention provided ample opportunity for some interesting special effects. Granted, those effects are nowhere near today's standards but even the least convincing of these efforts still possess a certain charm. I should note that the film won it's sole Oscar for the Special Effects, perhaps the most impressive of which is the famous parting of the Red Sea.The direction by DeMille is assured and the film also boasts an Elmer Bernstein score. Not among his very best, mind you, but it definitely has it's moments. I wish that the film hadn't relied so much on blue-screen technology but I guess that the budget was already high enough without adding even more location shooting.While your enjoyment may be affected by your religious background I think that it is an intriguing story regardless. Certainly a must-see for anyone who loves epic films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Promised Land of Spectacle and Majesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What love! What a drama! What a story! What majesty!(...)" proclaimed the theatrical trailers in the mid 1950s when Cecil B DeMille directed his last film, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956) with Charlton Heston. Although it was his remake of the 1923 movie with Theodore Roberts, its content this time was to be entirely set in the famous years of yore when Moses led his people from Egypt to the Promised Land, when the Hand of Almighty God showed great power and when freedom arose among tyrannies of slavery and sin.In spite of the fact that more than 50 years have passed since the premiere of the movie and there have been other "Moses productions," this film still stands out as the most spectacular, respected, visual and memorable biblical production ever made. As an adult now, I often come back in my memory to the days of my late childhood and early youth when I was deeply absorbed by watching THE TEN COMMANDMENTS on TV, usually at Easter time. When I recently came back to it, I realized that it still impresses me. Let me analyze some of its strongest aspects not ignoring possible flaws as well.Firstly, Cecil B DeMille's movie (beside BEN HUR) most clearly resembles one of the key aspects of colossal cinema and "DeMille's cinema": HUGE SPECTACLE. This refers both to crowd scenes as well as the depiction of historical period with all its exotic glamor, sets and costumes. The viewer does not have to identify with the characters, does not have to believe in the story or does not have to be any, so to say, "Bible buff." Epic productions are characterized by the superiority of the spiritually visual over the spiritually mental. It's enough that there is a spectacle being a real feast for the eye, there are crowds of extras providing the thrilling atmosphere, there are costumes leading to breathtaking moments, there is vivid imagination constituting a journey to the distant past. All this splendor, grandeur, majesty that almost reach the very upright realms of imagination stun the viewers. Among these moments, I should mention the two most unforgettable ones: the parting of the Red Sea and the Sinai sequence when Moses receives the Ten Commandments. Based on Arnold Friberg's 'pre-visualization' paintings, the images beautifully influence one's biblical imagination.Secondly, there are truly outstanding cast. Charlton Heston has become almost 'symbolic' as Moses. His role may be divided into two phases: the Moses before the mission and the Moses whilst the mission. He leaves the Sinai changed, transformed into a prophet, transformed by the very catharsis of seeing the Lord. In the second phase, Charlton Heston resembles the very 'artistic' image of Moses (particularly resembling Michelangelo's sculpture in Rome). This portrayal still appears to many people as the most accurate. He is the awaited deliverer, a leader of mutual freedom into individual freedom. Yul Brynner as Rameses is also unforgettable: not only as far as looks are concerned but also the wonderful depiction of various feelings and desires like pride, anger, jealousy, vanity. He is a ruler and also a leader but, contrarily to Moses, the one of sheer tyranny into decadence, bondage and captivity. Those two different leaders: Moses and Rameses are symbols of the film with parallels to timeless conception and the 20th century, too. Moses leads his people in the glory of God while Rameses gathers his army of chariots shouting "Death to their God!" (isn't that exactly what some 20th century philosophers aimed at proclaiming...the death of God?) In between comes a beautiful woman, Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, a sort of Cleopatra and a sort of Poppaea from DeMille's former epics. Yet, she also seems to represent very biblical female characters of luxury and sin like Potiphar's wife, Salome, etc.The supporting cast also do extraordinary jobs. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is very noble in the role of old Pharao Sethi; Vincent Price is Egyptian like as the great architect Baka, Edward G Robinson is very convincing as cruel master Dathan, Nina Foch and Judith Anderson are also given some best parts; Debra Paget is sweet and extraordinarily beautiful as captive Lilia and John Derek charismatic as Joshua.Thirdly, DeMille's film has one more significant feature: real commitment of producers and the director. It is something that modern cinema needs at many levels and should learn from this film. Today, there is a tendency to make films without particular efforts just for money and profit. Yet, film is art and true art always needs effort. This purifying effort and particularly good intentions are still noticeable in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.However, there are people who criticize this movie also posing logical arguments. One of the attacks on THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is that it distorts the biblical events for the sake of spectacle above anything else. It's true that the film, in the first half, concentrates too much on rather detailed and fictitious events in Egypt ignoring the role of Moses on the desert, for instance or the insight into psychological growth of freedom. Another critical view refers to the length of the movie. Indeed, it seems that the storyline based on ancient text and the Holy Scriptures sometimes develops endlessly.Finally, let me quote Nina Foch, the actress who plays Bithia in the film. She often introduced the TV buffs with the Easter screening of the film. She said when asked about the film's test of time: "It will outlast us all!"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is, in my opinion, an extraordinary movie, one of the last Cecil B DeMille's symbols, a perfect supply of biblical imagination of grandeur and majesty and a true art of performances. A timeless motion picture!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is part of Hollywood folklore,made at a time when there was no CSI imaging,a cast of thousands.This film is directed by the legendary Cecil B deMille, it has a few moments that are slow,but generally the film moves at a good pace.The key performer is Charlton Heston who holds the film together with an outstanding performance as Moses.Yul Brynner is a mean Pharoah,and good support is given from Edward G Robinson ,Anne Baxter,Yvvonne de Carlo ,Cedric Hardwicke and Vincent Price.Cecil B Demille explains the theme of the film at the start, it remains a visual treat especially the building of the city and the parting of the red sea.This film has worked for 51 years, and still works today.There are rumours of a remake I just hope they don't forget-why this film was a success,update the effects but keep the human story.Cecil b Demille was a great Hollywood epic directer he has not been replaced,though at times Steven Spielberg comes close.Cecils last fin his is legacy to the world thanks Cecil</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some things that may have been overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be just individual tastes, even with the change in time, but I have never been able to see how or why anyone could naturally assume Anne Baxter, attractive as she was, was "obviously" so much more beautiful than Yvonne deCarlo. I found Miss deCarlo lovelier, and not just because the script pointed out that "Sepphora (Tzipporah)" had a superior character. My guess is that deMille chose Miss deCarlo in that particular role because of the relative fame/box office of the two ladies - or because Miss deCarlo had a distinctly more "earthy" quality than Miss Baxter.Another even smaller but very important, note is Woody Strode. He says nothing in the film, and yet, in both scenes where he figures, he is the focus of attention. As the silent King of Ethiopia, you get the feeling that, even beaten in battle, he is unconquered, and knows himself to be Pharoah's equal. That his silence is not through fear, but pride. You cannot take your eyes from him. And when he is doing double-duty as one of Bithia's bearers, he uses a facial expression regrettably inflicted on black actors through the ages - that of wide-rolling eyed fear - but when *he* does it, you get none of the cringing, whining feel you get when other actors were out through this same pace. You get the natural fear of simple people - of any color - of a power greater than they understand.A lot of people damn this movie as camp, and there are loads of foul-ups - both technical and scriptural (shoe-horning Jesus into a story where he *cannot* belong is the worst and most insulting) - but the visuals are superb, the acting is fine and the movie itself a treat to watch; it stands the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, starring Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner, is a classic above many movies. Based on the story of Moses and the great exodus out of Egypt, it will be remembered as one of few movies that is closest to a true story. Though it probably didn't happen the way it was portrayed in this movie, the events surrounding the events actually happened.Moses is a Hebrew, but doesn't know it. Upon finding out the truth, he leaves Egypt, and tears later, returns to Egypt to ask Remisis, who was a king, or as they call it, a Pharough, to let the Hebrews go. THe Hebres had been slaves for many years, and it was time to let them go. At first, Remisis refused. But then, after his own son dies, he finally lets them go.This movie is very long, but it is worth every minute. My Score: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Oh Moses, Moses...you stubborn, splendid, adorable fool!!!"Hollywood's view of the Bible, yep!!! Over the top acting??? You bet!!! The same themes over and over??? Of course!!! Long??? Oh yeah!!!So what???!!! THE TEN COMMANDMENTS starring Charlton Heston, Anne Baxter, Yul Brynner, Cedrick Hardwicke, Edward G. Robinson, Vincent Price and John Derek is the great Cecil B. Demille classic of all time. THE PRINCE OF EGYPT, that fairly recent animated film was a beautifully done, state of the art telling of the exact same story, yet it will never go down in history like this 1956 epic!!! Even with all its Hollywood-ized content (glamour, passion, white faces portraying ancient dark skinned civilizations, with the exception of those portraying Nubians, Ethiopians and a few Arabs), THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is a noble, sincere, God-glorifying piece of film, presenting all of its characters as humans, showing humanity in all of its lightness, darkness, and imperfection. Moses, who begins as a "fair young god", a heartthrob who has the heart of Nefretiri and a conqueror who returns in triumph from a war with Ethiopia, evolves completely into a prophet of God, a sober, serious leader who delivers the Hebrews out of 400 years of horrible slavery. Nefretiri, the perfect female, skin as white as curd, arms as soft as the breast of a dove, madly in love with the heartthrob, shows her dark side when Moses, having returned from exile to confront the Pharoah, refuses to resume their love affair. We even love Sethi, played to absolute perfection by the great British actor Hardwicke. We know he has no love for the Hebrew nation, that they are no better than worms to him, yet we see him as a human being, a wonderful father figure, a man who loves his children, (it is a fact that in those days, half sisters and half brothers married, so Nefretiri and Rameses had the same father and different mothers) no matter what else he is. Robinson is memorable too, as troublesome Dathan, who is constantly planting and sowing seeds of doubt and distrust into the peoples' minds as they journey from Egypt to Canaan. He and Yul Brynner had some great dialogue scenes: "A rat's ears and a ferret's nose" "To use in your service, Glorious One!!!"The one loathsome character I could feel nothing for was Rameses, played by the stonefaced Brynner. I have never really observed any of this actor's other work, not even Westworld, so I cannot compare this performance to any other. I only felt contempt for him, and I doubt if Brynner is a bad actor. It's probably rather the character of Rameses who is devoid of humanity. I admit he had some cruelly good lines: "Give this Prince of Israel one day's ration of bread and water" and "They SHALL remember the name of Moses...only that he died under my chariot wheels!!!"The costumes are gorgeous. I too loved Lilia's golden gown that Baka made her wear, and Nefretiri's many sheer veils were lovely. The jewelry, war armour, and of course the robes of the peasant Hebrews were excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> I'm not a Bible and Christian freak though I am a christian. I loved watching this movie and it got me delighted and riveted to the last second!!!!! Charleton Heston and Anne Baxter are excellent as our main characters Moses and his lover Nefreteri. The cast who played Pharoah Rameses,Pharoah Sethi,Sephora(Mose- s's wife),Aaron(his brother), and Bithia and Yoshebal (Moses's mothers) were also great standouts and Dathan (ED G. ROBINSON) was the BEST!!! This film is greatly based on the ancient accounts of Philo,Josephus, and Midash but points out graetly what the Holy Scriptures actually mean. We are not just owned by the world but also of the divine, the God of Abraham and his son Jesus Christ. The characters greatly react to the events, each other, and of this mysterious Divine True God who worked through Aaron and Moses awesomly told through the award-winning visual effects of the miracles,plagues, and the Red Sea.4**** definitely and points out what we should do just like Moses did.

		<fullReview>Every Easter Sunday, I try to rush home to see my favorite part...Moses collapses from being in the desert for many many days after being exiled by his brother the Pharoah. Shepherd girls find him and giggle at how handsome he is. Then some bad guys come around and steal water from the father's well. The girls try to stop them to no avail.But wait! The music starts and just like Popeye, Moses regains tremendous strength and kicks their butts! He has barely spoken to the intruders, yet the oldest daughter proclaims that he is not only strong, but wise. Then all the girls fight to see who gets to wash his feet.Yes, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is one of my favorite unintentional comedies. I'm cracking up as I write this while reviewing this scene in my head. Too bad he couldn't take five more steps before collapsing, because then he could've practically fallen into the well!This may be sacrilegious talk from someone who attended 13 years of Catholic school, but "epics" like this and THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD crack me up with their stiff acting and overblown dialogue. Not to mention the inspired casting of Edward G. Robinson! Hahaha, what a hoot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to me that Ramesses gets an unfairly bad rap from this movie. Sure, he's arrogant and bossy, but after all, he was of the royal line of Egypt! In his competition with Moses, he was straightforward, honest, and did not stoop to unfair subterfuge. Why shouldn't he consider Dathan's revelation a valid reason to disqualify Moses from becoming Pharaoh? Even after achieving this victory, and having Moses totally at his mercy, he does not execute his rival, but exiles him, even predicting that he'll forget his troubles with another woman.After several years, Moses shows up again, in total violation of the Pharoah's edict. Ramesses reacts to this with unusual forbearance. He merely smirks, and permits Moses to hang around his court. Moses disrupts the river purification ceremony, but Ramesses prevents anyone from killing him. Moses turns up on a private terrace while Ramesses is trying to read, and instead of having Moses killed, Ramesses merely tries to ignore him and wishes he'd quit bugging him. In fact Moses is attacking his kingdom with multiple supernatural assaults, yet Ramesses tries to shrug it all off as natural events and fails to molest his foster brother, or the Hebrews, until he has endured many provocations. Finally he reaches the reasonable decision to free the slaves, only to be turned from this by the manipulations of Nefretiri, a foolish act of pride and weakness on his part, not of evil. By the way, in the Bible it is God who mysteriously hardens Pharaoh's heart all these times, not Nefretiri.After his plan to kill the Hebrew firstborn backfires, he again decides to free the slaves. The damage to Egypt would have been contained if not for the further scheming of Nefretiri. Of course we know from history that Ramesses II was one of the most successful of all Egyptian pharaohs, and went on to an extraordinarily long and prosperous reign.I am left with the impression that Ramesses regarded Moses with a certain respect. Moses was certainly a more interesting character before his encounter with the Burning Bush. I think if these two guys had ever sat down together without their respective sticks being inserted, they could have worked things out and avoided all kinds of trouble. Of course that might have taken a toll on the movie's dramatic content.</fullReview>

I did not find it as annoying that time. So I got it again, and again and again! Then I found it cheap at a K-Mart store, so I bought it! I LOVE this film!!! It is film making at it's best! First I found only the splitting of the sea amazing. Now I find the whole movie amazing! Chuck Heston really performed amazingly in this film!

		<shortDescription>You have to see the original in a real theatre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film cannot be remade. cgi is not going to make this classic better, it can only do worse, and anyone can see the difference, even a 2 year old.To know why Moses' hair turns white or is shortened, you have to actually watch the film.DeMille was often criticised for his lavish expenditures, yet he never made a film that lost money.Moses leads the people Israel out of bondage and in so doing upsets the world leader of the times, his adoptive father, Pharoah.Many critics have written about this film, most of whom have gotten the content all wrong. So, you have to see this film from 1956 before seeing any attempt at an impossible remake."The Ten Commandments" is about those ten laws, not moral codes or ethics, but actual laws, that every lawyer and judge love to argue about as some kind of religious conflict between state and church; this is precisely what Moses and Pharoah argue about, Who's law is it, anyway? As such, the film shows not only what the basis of law is, but who suggested the profession of judges, since there were no judges before Moses time, only administrators acting on behalf of dictators.There is so much to this film that every frame of it was justified. I seriously doubt than any remake will have anywhere near the length of this film, which required an half hour intermission and during the 1950's you could still get a real meal in a theatre, nor can it achieve the quality of a once in history masterpiece. The film represents also a once in history masterpiece event, liberation from slavery in Africa. And its script stuck strictly to the original story line.There were two originals, both directed by DeMille; one in 1923 and one in 1956. Both original because one was black and white with no sound, and the other was done by DeMille when colour and sound were available, and he topped his first production with this one.This is what a film should be and cgi should stay on the computer, where it belongs, and be forbidden from film works. Were Cecil B. DeMille and the cast around today, he and they would insist on much better special effects than can be provided by the limitations of digital reality "look-alikes" {are you kidding me with the spell checker? - a typical example of how computers simply can't get it right - "look-alikes" as well as the square brackets as tags instead of parentheses - there were five things the computer cgi missed from this human director as well - I have "misspelt" nothing, perhaps Miriam Webster is the one who can't spell in English and does not know the conjugations of the Enlish language - oops! the cgi has "misspelt" "English" and missed its misspelling! Is there any other proof needed to show that cgi can't remake this film?}.And Hollywood should just leave well enough alone and try, for a change, to make something original, as DeMille and his cast and crew did.Find it in a theatre, or ask for it in Santa Cruz at one of the world's only remaining drive in theatres, you will clearly see that any attempt to remake it is sheer vanity.This was no cheap film. It ranks among the greatest films ever made, and right up there with DaVinci's "Mona Lisa" and Michaelangelo Buonaroti's "David." You can't remake them either and you have to see the original in person. There is no other way to know what great art is.Go see the real "Ten Commandments."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Fun Than It Was Meant To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about six years old when I first saw this movie. This was at at time when movies took a long time to make it to television, and the only hope one had of seeing a film again was when (and if) the film was re-released. I remember very vividly how I was caught up the the wonder of it all. Even at that young age, what I remembered most was the music score.When the movie was re-released (before it became an annual television event), the LP of the film score was also reissued. I actually wore out one copy of the album because I listened to it so much.Today, of course, I look at this movie with much different eyes. With all the bad things it has going for it (silent screen-style acting, wretched dialogue, ridiculous casting in the secondary parts, re-writing of traditional notions of Biblical history, etc., etc.) I can't help but say this -- I love this movie! Although I love it for different reasons today.There are so much computer generated special effects in movies nowadays it is almost impossible to understand the impact that this movie had when it was released. And the gargantuan cast -- what other movie can you think of that had so many leading performers of their day (whether you agree with the casting or not)? Hollywood simply could not afford to do this sort of thing today.And there is something else about this film -- under all the glossy spectacle and silliness, I genuinely feel that all the actors were giving a very sincere performance (again, whether you like the performance or not.) I never tire of watching Anne Baxter slither, saunter and strut around the film like a cat in heat. I can't help but think what a good drag queen she would have made, if such things were possible.I highly recommend the DVD print. The movie is absolutely gorgeous, and the sound fantastic.I don't watch The Ten Commandments much these days, perhaps once every 3 or 4 years. However, not too many months go by without me pulling down the soundtrack CD from the shelf and taking it for a spin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I stumble across this essential slab of Hollywoodiana on cable, satellite, etc., I sit for a few minutes, cackling like a road-company Jack Nicholson at the utter cheesiness of it all, and the numbing seriousness with which everyone in the super-starry cast seems to approach it. But may that scary Old Testament God of the Hebrews strike me with 11 plagues if, after the manic reaction wears off, I'm not utterly hooked on it, AGAIN. It's the exuberance that DeMille, then in his 70s, brings to this timeless dreck that saves it; it's as if he's blithely indifferent to the quasi-Kahlil Gibran-esque dialogue and the danger of meddling too much with one of the Almighty's fave tales. He just keeps piling on the extras and the set decoration until it all just WORKS. The acting is resolutely stony, with Chuck Heston (then all of 26) setting the tone with the granitine baritone and the chiseled features of a cinematic golem. (For all that, he'd never give a better acting performance in toto than this one.) The smirking Anne Baxter holds up the distaff end with sleazy, slippery girlpower, and the very yong Yul Brynner matches Heston brick for brick as the young Rameses. The veteran Edward G. Robinson, playing the scheming Jew that all Protestant America knows lurks in corporate boardrooms the world over, seems to be the only cast member acquainted with the notion of dramatic irony: he sneers like some Eigth Avenue pawnbroker who's heard one too many sad stories, and he's utterly unrepentant when he (almost) puts the kibosh on Moses' party in the desert. I could spend hours delineating why this creaking tripe shouldn't work, but why bother? "The Ten Commandments" is just a indelible piece of Hollywood craft the likes of which, for good or ill, we shall likely never see again.--30--</fullReview>

To take on a grand epic like this took guts, and DeMille achieved grace and beauty in one of the grandest spectacle's to ever hit a silver screen. From the grandness of the sets to the amount of extras, sets, colors and special effects shots used in this film, a film like this would probably never be made by today's standards and costs.

		<fullReview>This is surely one of the best biblical epics ever to be filmed. Even though it is terribly long, it is also terribly inspiring. The use of colour (or even the lack of it) is very ingenious, the script is intelligent, the acting is excellent, the visual effects are marvellous, the setting is realistic, the score fits excellently and overall it is GREAT. It was a very intelligent idea not to base the script only on the Holy Scriptures, but also on other novels. This gave the plot an original story, where everyone knows how it will end, but how this end is reached is a mystery. The love sub-plots are also interesting bringing up such issues as male dominion over slave-girls, forbidden love and marrying for love instead for pro-creation. Sadly this was C.B. de Mille's last film, but on second thoughts it could not have been better than this way: his last film ranks amongst his best and among the very best in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A most human story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is mythic but time has been harsh on it. In 1956 the Cold War was not exactly helping the West, the USA and Hollywood to be in any way open-minded and tolerant. This film is a Christian caricature wrapped up in some Jewish garb that does not change the message: freedom is no freedom if it is conquered at the price of the enslavement or death of other people. The message is not "Let my people go!" but the Jews ? hence the Christians because in the USA it is the same when they talk of the Bible ? are right, they have God on their side, God is all-powerful almighty omniscient and extremely vindictive and punishing. The vision of such a God and having such a God as a reference in a culture is nothing but fundamentalism, extreme sectarianism.They forget that Hebrews and Egyptians are both Semitic, that the Semites in the Middle East who came from Egypt around 120,000 years ago but left the Middle East and the Levant around 80,000 years ago to come back only around 35,000 years ago, came back from Egypt precisely and Judaism was invented in the Levant probably 3,000 years BCE, 5,000 years ago. The first figure of this culture is Abraham and the main Semitic culture that developed from 6,000 years BCE in the Levant was the Phoenicians. Then my question is how did the Jews manage to become the slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt or how did the Jewish faith manage to spread among the Egyptian slaves? In a way or another how did either the Jews or Judaism manage to be brought into Egypt and then how did the Jews become slaves or how did Judaism spread among the slaves?The film takes it for granted that the Jews were slaves in Egypt without answering these simple questions. And that is not acceptable from a standard western critical mind's point of view.Then the God of these Hebrews or Jews is a God of vengeance and a God of punishment. The problem emerges here and there nicely but is never really discussed in any way. These Jews are against their being slaves but they submit to any kind of easy domination, be it that of a golden calf or bull or cow or oxen, a sterile golden representation of a bovine animal, or be it two tables of stone with ten commandments (and Mosaic law is a lot more than just ten commandments: it is bigger than the Napoleonic Code). They accept their golden idol in the name of freedom, the freedom to be dominated by an image, the freedom to enslave their own brothers and sisters to their impulses and desires, sexual, morbid or criminal, or the freedom to be dominated by a God that imposes commandments and laws, much more than just ten commandments indeed with the power of all natural elements against disobedient individuals, under duress and menaced, if not terrorized, into fright and fear, if not just submissive loss of any critical mind or individual beliefs. And I will not say anything about the criminal vision against the Egyptians. Pharaoh kills the Jewish newborns or menaces to kill the Jewish firstborns and Moses turns it around with the help of his God, Moses' God, who will kill all Egyptian firstborns while passing over all Jewish houses that would have spread some lamb blood on their door frames. Not only is it primitive but what's more it is unacceptable: you cannot use the weapons of your opponents ? and the word enemy is an unacceptable word and when it is used we must understand that my enemies are not declared as such by me but are declared as such by themselves, and I am supposed to forgive my self-declared enemies because they are not my enemies and they do not know what they are doing. This film uses the Old Testament in the worst possible way because it turns that Old Testament into a weapon of narrow-minded bigotry, meaning God is the God of the Jews and it will destroy all the non-Jews who would in any way speak or act unfavorably towards the Jews. It is the absolute negation of man's critical mind both among the Jews who must obey that God and his commandments and laws, and on the side of the non- Jews because they cannot in anyway even silently think the Jews might be wrong in slightest way, and not only in their faith but in all their acts and thoughts. You cannot criticize anything Jewish or any Jew without at once being called anti-Semite. Then the film is at least one hour too long. It enjoys being slow and descriptive instead of using ellipses and shortcuts. We all know the story. And luckily it did not give all the plagues like the locusts for one example. But even so the film could have been shortened and the film could have given some proper detail about the great trip to Palestine. What about the bronze snake? And they were pushed back by the Canaanites. They were thus obliged to go North and go around the Canaanites to then take them from the West, literally in their back and they destroyed as many as possible and Canaanites were forever rejected because they refused to give their land "graciously" that is to say free and without any resistance, and I guess become servants, which is a clear synonym of slave in the old Testament when it deals with non- Jews. This film has aged and it is in a way rather surprising that it still inspires some Christian minds. Jesus has so little to do with Moses. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even with lines like that, the Cecil B. Demille's "The Ten Commandments" still manages to be impressive in its scope and thrill audiences, making it an Eastertime favorite.This was Demille's last film, certainly an ambitious undertaking that tells the story of Moses and how he led his people out of Egypt. Heston told a funny story of booming out the line, LET MY PEOPLE GO and Demille following it up with "Okay, lunch." The film has some unintentionally funny scenes, and some moments that are astounding, touching and exciting. The cast is very impressive, with Heston making a strong and virile Moses, Cedric Hardwicke a marvelous Sethi, Yul Brynner a powerful Rameses, John Derek an effective and very hunky Joshua and Debra Paget a lovely Lilia. Yvonne DeCarlo was never more beautiful than when she portrayed Sephora - and the list of names in the cast goes on and on - Anne Baxter, Edward G. Robinson, Vincent Price, John Carradine, Nina Foch, Martha Scott, Olive Deering, Judith Anderson, Henry Wilcoxin, Eduard Franz - etc.! The special effects are special indeed - this is 1956 and there were no computers to help create the burning bush, write the ten commandments, part the red sea, or drown the pursuers of the Jews as they left Egypt. Some of the effects are more successful than others, the burning bush being the most cartoon-like. That's a small criticism. When Moses parts that Red Sea, no matter how many times you've seen it, it's still thrilling.Possibly the most touching moment is the old man who dies in Moses' arms, lamenting that he did not live to see his Redeemer - but the audience knows that his wish did come true. And I admit to getting chills when I hear, "So let it be written. So let it be done." All of that is the up side. Now for the down. Some of the dialogue is strictly modern, especially among Sephora and her sisters and the girls giggling by the pool - pure Hollywood - giving rise to the film's reputation as "camp." Anne Baxter's Nefertiti is problematic but then, so are some of her lines, like the above "Oh, Moses, Moses etc." For a good actress, she's not really very convincing. Edward G. Robinson's Dathan is a little problematic as he says in his Little Ceasar voice, "Eh, what about your God now, Moses?" but he is appropriately slimy. But this is all part of the "The Ten Commandments," and no fan of the film would do without any of it, including the majestic music by Elmer Bernstein.It's impossible to describe the effect of Moses parting the Red Sea and the flight from Egypt - definitely the highlight of the film - and there's a definite lesson about trusting and having faith.You can be wowed by this film, you can love it, you can be entertained by it, you can laugh at it - but "The Ten Commandments" will elicit a strong reaction from you, and hopefully an appreciation of its great spectacle.So let it be written. So let it be done</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The religious movie even an atheist can love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obvious words of warning apply: this movie almost certainly bears as much resemblance to anything that actually happened as THE LORD OF THE RINGS does to the history of Western Europe. The glory of this film is the way the primary-colour costumes, huge sets, magnificently portentous (but often very poetic and witty) dialogue, the special effects and the acting, manage to make believing in God seem like so much *FUN* that even I, as a Proper Atheist, finished up thinking "wow, the Bible sure has some pretty great stories in it". Note also how Mose's change from concerned member of the nobility to instrument of The Lord is traced with proper attention to every stage of the transformation ? until the burning bush, he's always the cautious skeptic who wants to believe, but follows the path of righteousness from the conscious choice of his heart rather than through blind religious zeal. It makes his emergence as Gandalf the White in the second half seem *so* much more earned, that I found I could cheer wholeheartedly for a character which might easily have felt two-dimensional.This film is a better advert for Christianity than a thousand dry-as-dust Sunday School lessons. THE PASSION OF THE Christ (which, don't get me wrong, was a decent retelling of the last day of Jesus and much more 'realist' than this) doesn't come close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still cheesy after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall seeing TTC in its initial 1956 release. It's held up for nearly 50 years as one of the most enjoyably ridiculous films ever made. Its supposedly "incredible" special effects were poor even then: the staff turning into a serpent (through bad animation); children in the audience whispering, "You can see the lines around the water," in the Parting of the Red Sea sequence; the dry-ice machines pumping green fog through stage sets to represent The Plague; the crudely animated Finger of God etching the Ten Commandments; et al.Sheer schlock.Others' comments about the "truth" of TTC are rendered irrelevant after several centuries of scientific and historical research, most recently in the 2002 "Etz Hayim," (Google it) prove that Moses never existed, that the Jews never wandered for 40 years in the desert, etc. It's like debating how "true" "Snow White" is.Charlton Heston is ponderous as ever. Anne Baxter slinks around uttering laughable dialogue. Bare-chested, glowering, Yul Brynner in "The King and I" mode, only meaner. Edward G. Robinson as "Little Caesar" in Egyptian drag.DeMille's "ouvre" is always fascinating. He was churning this stuff out in the silent era, with Gloria Swanson (and others). His genius was as a marketer who never overestimated the intelligence or taste of the mass audience he consistently sought, and won. "The Greatest Show on Earth" rivals TTC for bad acting (Heston again, this time with Betty Hutton, who mistakes mugging for acting), with equally cheesy effects (See Miniature Trains Collide!).Just three years after TTC came Charlton Heston's greatest (some would say ONLY) role in William Wyler's "Ben-Hur." Far superior in every way to TTC, "Ben-Hur" remains the greatest, most intelligent, best-filmed and directed Biblical epic of all time.But, like all great cheeses, TTC stinks more with age and is therefore highly prized in some circles.</fullReview>

DeMille knew just how to play the game (and Wood clearly did not), so he was able to splash garbage on the screen and get Hollywood to pat him on the back for doing so. He pandered to the basest instincts of his low-brow middle-American audience and dressed it up with biblical quotations and pretentious promises of moral rectitude. He was basically a con-artist with a camera, a P.T. Barnum let loose in cinema and given the green light by financiers and media mavens - and he got job done for them. 10 Bore-mandments made a ton of bucks, and film critics who should know better continue to sing its praise - Now that's the mark of a truly great con-artist!It was unfortunate for DeMille that he died when he did - he would have made a lot of money as a televangelist. Old joke - God comes down to Moses: God: 'Moses, I want to give you a commandment.' Moses: 'How much does it cost?' God: 'It's free.' Moses: 'I'll take ten.'This little story tells the whole story - forget the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ohhhhhh! Moses! Moses! Moses!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ten Commandments is the most gaudy, over-acted, and funny movie, in places, that was ever made. How in the world could these actors and actresses keep a straight face? I'm sure they with much instinct knew that this could be the biggest all-time bomb ever put on the screen if they didn't play this movie with God-Awful overacting at it's worse, and that's what makes this camp classic so entertaining! And here's Dame Judith Anderson, playing a slave, with an embarrassing look on her face as to how she could ever get conned into playing this role, but who knows, at that time in acting career, maybe she needed the money! One time Hermoni Gingold appeared on the Jack Paar Show on early television, and he asked her what she thought of the first time she pulled into the Harbor and saw our Lady standing in the Harbor, and Ms. Gingold, in her very British accent said, "Oh! I thought it was just wonderful! But, I could help wonder why they had a statue of Judith Anderson in the Harbor! I have the letter-box version of this film and every time someone appears saying, "Ohhhh, Moses! Moses! Moses! I expect someone to jump up and shout out JERRY! JERRY! JERRY! But the classic funny scene out of many that no one sees is when Yul Brynner confronts Ann Baxter and tells her EXACTLY what to expect with her being his wife and that he will treat her better than his horses! Insult to injury wouldn't you say? Then he tells her something like this that she will come to him when he wants and that whether she enjoys his love making is no concern of his, but, he adds in an arrogant manner, "But I think you will!" And the look on Annie's overacted expression is priceless, and FUNNY! Of course, we all know about Edward G. Robinson being told he's going to go to hell! But, what everyone doesn't seem to see at the end of the film, probably because we're so tired and want this whole nearly four hours of hamming it up to end, anyway, Moses comes down from the mountain and Eddy boy says, "Here, now! Did you carve those tablets yourself? Moses, you take too much upon yourself!" And when the Red Sea, which was liquid jello pouring out and then with clever reverse photography got the sea to open, anyway, there are these three maids that look like strippers out of your local strip bar, in a trio with their arms up, wind blowing, trying to protect themselves from heaven knows what! Of course, the music is extravagant and very powerful to match the overacting of its entire cast! And at the end, Charelton Heston in his white wig looking like an ad for Johnson and Johnson surgical cotton supplies, ends the film telling everyone to go into the world and the audience heaves a sign of relief and quickly makes tracks out of Dodge! But, taking everything into account, this movie is very entertaining, and a classic camp romp for everyone in the cast to the over-scored musical soundtrack. With less competent actors, this movie would have flopped on its nose! It's funny how certain lines in movies become famous, even Moses! Moses! Moses! has become as famous as You'll Be Hiss, You'll Be Hiss, You'll be History and Lion's and Tiger's and Bears, in The Wizard of Oz! Great cast! Great music! And, I only have one more thing to say: "Ohhhhhh! Moses! Moses! Moses! Indeed!"</fullReview>

His last epic, "The Ten Commandments" (1956) still is thrilling and this timeless classic still attracts audiences world-wide. To be able to see this great film in the original and improved format (Arclight Theatres in Hollywood, CA) will be exciting and I am purchasing a number of seats for my family and friends. And the message of this film is as relevant today as today's morning newspaper! I WOULD HOPE IN 2006 WHEN THIS WONDERFUL FILM CELEBRATES ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY, A VERY SPECIAL CELEBRATION WILL BE HELD and if so, I hope to attend! I attended the opening of this film at the Criterion Theatre in New York in 1956. So, my recommendation, my very strong recommendation, get over to Hollywood at the Arclight and enjoy this classic on the big screen and be thrilled again or for the first time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Mille fails again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Mille had filmed the story previously in 1923. He failed then too.Here he has created spectacle for the sake of spectacle and wrapped it in Biblical trimmings. The sets are great as are the special effects. However, the lines the actors deliver are awkward, stilted, unnatural, and ultimately quite annoying. This is perhaps as unmoving a film as I've ever seen for one with so much passion, tragedy, spirituality, anger, vengeance, love, etc. All in all, the film is a great emotional void.Sir Cedric Hardwick gives a good effort and manages not to sink beneath the dialogue. The real performance is from Yvonne DeCarlo who is remarkably subdued and strong in her role as Sephora. Edward G. Robinson is wasted; Anne Baxter is wasted; Vincent Price is wasted. John Derek should never have been allowed on the set. But the greatest mistake in casting is Charlton Heston who plays Charlton Heston. He undergoes a transformation when he sees the burning bush. He then walks through the role as Charlton Heston delivering lines in stentorian tones. I miss Moses.The Elmer Bernstein score makes for a great soundtrack! But neither the music nor the wonderful sets can salvage this travesty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I should say that my favorite Bible-themed movie is Monty Python's "Life of Brian". So, I watched "The Ten Commandments" mainly so that I could heckle it like on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". For example, when Moses and Nefretiri are getting slinky, I blurted out "Is that a sphinx in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?". Like any biblical epic, it sets itself up to get mocked.Aside from the obvious soap opera qualities inherent in Cecil B. DeMille's epic, it's still one that I recommend. It appears that the movie was a slight allusion to the Cold War, with the stuff about men not having to live under tyranny. The orgy actually looks as if it would have been pretty fun. I remember that in "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar", the drag queen characters show a girl "TTC" to inspire her to dress like Anne Baxter. Part of the reason that the movie's hard to take seriously is the giant cast, including the NRA president, the guy from gangster flicks, Lily Munster and a horror star.I've always thought that it would be neat to cast Harrison Ford as Moses. He could split the Red Sea with a light saber, and then after getting the commandments, escape a series of traps like Indiana Jones.All in all, this movie is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie while in elementary school in the 1980s. (It was a small Catholic school). The movie was extremely long and shown over the course of two days. I was impressed as a child, especially with the special effects and costuming. As an adult, I am still impressed with the costuming and special effects (given that this film was made in the late 50s). However, this film has so many cultural and racial (yes racial) inaccuracies, coupled with over the top acting and bad dialogue that I cannot see it as 'one of the greatest films of all time.' It also has a great historical inaccuracy in it where it leads the viewer to believe that the pyramids were built by Hebrew slaves. What about the pyramids that existed prior to and after Hebrew enslavement? Archaeologists and historians have proved otherwise. I don't even want to get started on the cultural and racial inaccuracies.I do not have the space. I did however admire Yul Brenner's performance. Everyone else, including Charlton Heston, paled in comparison to him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>each and every movie about Moses rounds the edges and simply omits the parts of the Tanakh that don't go well with Christian point of view? Quoting Exodus:'But I myself shall make Pharaoh stubborn. I myself shall make him obstinate. He will not let you go until I have stretched out my arm and struck Egypt. I shall lay my hand on Egypt and with great acts of judgment.' 'I shall ensure that the Egyptians are so impressed with this people that when you go, you will not go empty-handed. Every woman will ask her neighbor for silver and golden jewelry, and clothing. In these you will dress your own sons and daughters, despoiling the Egyptians of them.'So basically, a Jewish tribal god wants to exact as much revenge as possible on those who dared to torment his nation, then rob them, lead their king to the trap at the Red Sea and destroy him. Nothing surprising about this: Yahweh IS a cruel and brutal deity, unlike your forgiving, liberal, comfy Jesus. So why are the movie-makers so inconsistent? If they have a right to develop the story further, adding details to the short Biblical text, why are they afraid to face the truth and show it how it is?</fullReview>

Superb production and direction, with Heston unforgettable and commanding as Moses.

		<shortDescription>There's no topping this biblical camp epic for excellence in acting, pacing and technical achievement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many highlights in this sometimes campy spectacle, and the best place to begin is with its out-of-the-ordinary introduction by director Cecil B. DeMille who could star in a McDonald's commercial and still be unintentionally funny. But once the breathtaking Elmer Bernstein score opens the credits and the story rolls, you are hooked. Then, the story of Moses unfolds, telling how when the Pharaoh ordered the death of all newborns (as King Herod did at the time of the birth of Jesus), and mother Yochabel (Martha Scott) sends her daughter with the baby to make sure the child is adopted, and when it ends up in the Pharaoh's home as raised by his own daughter (Nina Foch), it is a sense of Godly irony. The only other person to know the truth is the slave Memnet (Judith Anderson), an embittered Egyptian who wants no Hebrew to be Pharaoh.Years later, the grown Moses (Charlton Heston) is at friendly rivalry with his cousin Ramases (Yul Brynnur) for the hand of the Princess Neferitiri (a very campy Anne Baxter) and circumstances arise which reveal the truth of his real identity. A silly subplot surrounds slave master Vincent Price who covets the Hebrew Debra Paget and his traitorous Hebrew overseer (extremely campy Edward G. Robinson) seeks ambitiously to gain power through his sudden knowledge in regards to Prince Moses. Sent out into the desert, Moses meets his future wife (a somewhat non-campy Yvonne DeCarlo, usually cast in the type of role that Baxter plays) and his destiny for leading the Hebrew slaves out of Egypt is set.So ends Act One, and there is much more camp, much more spectacle to follow, and it is all riveting, perfect in every way. This is one of those films where you ask why every Egyptian or Roman ruler had a British accent (in this case Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Pharaoh Seti) and after Hardwicke expresses his displeasure to an adviser with his constant retort "You Old Windbag", you know you're not in Biblical Egypt anymore but the delightfully warped mind of the outrageous Cecil B. DeMille.Everything in this film works, from the showing of how the Hebrews help build the Egyptian Pyramids to the parting of the Red Sea, and finally to the Lord's revenge at Mount Sinai. Every actor, even those in minor roles, has something to do and some truly campy lines. Acting honors are split between Heston and Brynnur (who would win the Oscar the same year for "The King and I"), with particularly fine work by Anderson (demoted from Hebrew queen in "Salome" to slave here), Scott and John Carradine as Moses' brother Aaron, a role he plays like a Biblical John Brown. I must note that Anderson's costuming was almost repeated exactly when she played the Nurse in the 1981 Broadway revival of "Medea". Scott is particularly touching as she recognizes her son in a scene after he saves her from being crushed by a moving pyramid boulder when her outfit gets caught on it. Even with their over-the-top performances, you can't help but adore Baxter and Robinson, and in spite of the blandness of her role, DeCarlo is thoroughly lovely. The weak points are Paget and John Derek as Joshua who seems way too enthusiastic and sometimes appears to be extremely eager to take over Moses' calling.If you can, catch this one on the big screen, even if you have seen it a thousand times at Easter on television. The editing they do on TV is disastrous to the film's overall impact, especially with the excessive commercials which interrupt it. Try hard not to watch it as a comedy (I know that is very difficult considering how many people can quote this film beyond just reciting the actual ten commandments) and you will find something profound, but if you do find yourself laughing, you will not be the only one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously sparing no expense, and directing it in good old-fashioned Cecil B. DeMille style, this epic gives Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner the chance to give bigger than life performances--something both of them were equally capable of. Brynner struts his stuff as though he just stepped out of "The King and I," and Heston was obviously born to play the role of Moses in theatrical style.The story moves quickly from one big set piece to another, visually stunning in lavish settings (whether indoor or outdoors), and striking in costumes and use of Technicolor for some extraordinary special effects, considering this was before the time of CGI for crowd scenes and other marvels.Anne Baxter never looked lovelier nor was costumed with such a lavish wardrobe, but she does tend to overplay her part as Queen Nefretiri. However, since the dialog is so ripe one can't really blame her. John Derek, Debra Paget, Vincent Price, John Carradine, Henry Wilcoxon, Nine Foch, Judith Anderson, Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne De Carlo, Martha Scott and Cedric Hardwicke all offer their talents to supporting or cameo roles. Of them, only Edw. G. Robinson looks out of his element in this sort of costume epic and it's probably a good thing that he isn't given too much to do.Has to be regarded as one of Cecil B. DeMille's best productions, all of it looking magnificent in its fully restored splendor. When it's all over, it's Heston and Brynner who make the most memorable impression.Only quibble: Heston's aging for the final scene in what looks like a white department store beard made of cotton had me wincing, especially since the other players looked remarkably unscathed by time.</fullReview>

For example, some of the characters in it don't every age and what is typical of films made in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, blacks had no major role in the film, even though Egyptians and Hebrews were generally black or at less mix black during ancient times!

		<fullReview>I had to sat down and watch this 3 &amp; 1/2-hour epic for my "film appreciation" course. Otherwise I probably would have never consider to pay a visit to the story of Moses filmed in Technicolor and with Charlton Heston playing the main role. It was a worthy experience as this is a picture that sort of represents many things. It is a huge *studio* picture, the kind that most of the time doesn't transport you, for example, to Egypt but to a huge Hollywood studio set as it was Egypt, if that makes sense (from the IMDb trivia: "just under 5% of the film was actually shot in Egypt"). It is a picture with special effects that certainly were the s*** back in the day, but it is a picture that hasn't aged well (the effects are not really dated in the good way). It is a picture with over-the-top acting and dialog (and even an unnecessary introduction with director Cecil B. DeMille sort of explaining to us the movie!), just the kind of thing that is like a darn paradise if you want to make a parody. I mean, there's this scene when even one of the characters of the picture (the evil guy) is like "please cut the s*** Moses!" as he is like the most over-the-top possessed by God character around! Just the look of Charlton Heston after Moses finally hears the voice of God will make you laugh. But in the end, it is a picture that really success in its main point: it is hugely entertaining, a hugely entertaining "fairy tale". I didn't find, however, anything truly masterful in it (my teacher of the course keeps saying "back in those days if you wanted in your picture one thousand Egyptians you needed *one thousand* extras". So yes, maybe that, as it is indeed some huge work). .</fullReview>

But you also really have to put this movie in its perspective and realize that this movie was one of the very first within its sort. Movies like "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad", "Ben-Hur" and "Jason and the Argonauts" weren't made yet and this really was one of the very first Hollywood movies to take a grand, epic and adventurous approach with its story. Movies of this scale were something new and still in development. The movie takes an almost stage-play approach at times. This means foremost that the movie features often silly long dialog, that at times seem to come out of a Shakespeare play. Seriously, just no person ever said sentences that way, not even a couple of thousands of years ago. There is plenty of overacting in this movie, even from the greatest actors that are all in it. But it really didn't bugged me that much, since the overall movie was taking a bit of an overblown approach with basically everything and it did this well and effective, which caused me to be taken away by it all, nonetheless.I was definitely impressed by this movie. Not only by its looks but also really by its compelling story. It's of course a well known story, everybody is already in one way or another familiar with and it's a story with lots of great elements in it. Not that I really cared for any of the movie its religious messages but I can look past all of these elements. Nevertheless I should say that I don't think the movie always took a very good approach with its religious story elements. I don't feel it explains really enough as to why God does certain things, which at times makes 'his' actions seem a bit uncalled for and he is simply asking way to much of Moses and his people to endure. The movie claimed it tried to tell the story of Moses and then especially what happened with him in the period that he was still the prince of Egypt till the moment he came down the mountain, spreading the ten commandments amongst his people. For this it falls back to some scriptures and of course the bible itself but also foremost on some novels, that attempt the tell the true story and history of Moses. It's always a bit dodgy when a movie like this claims it's telling the true story and present things as facts, since it at times certainly takes a lot of liberties with its story and of course because no one on this earth could say what is really true about this story and what isn't.This movie is known for its epicness but also really because of its epic running time, that is around 3 and a half hours long. This is a long sit, for just every movie, no matter how great and compelling it is. And yes, they could had certainly cut some moments short in this movie or completely cut it out entirely but by saying this I by no means am of opinion that the movie has some bad scenes in it. Basically ever scenes is great to look at and really adds something to the story and its characters. But really, no movie ever needs to be that long and it's not like the story can only be told in a 3 hour+ movie. Just look at the "The Prince of Egypt" that is more than twice as short but still pretty much tells the same story.Visually this movie is really eye candy. It's a movie that got shot in full color and also really got made for the wide-screen. It uses plenty of early special effects, of which some are still quite looking by todays standards. But this movie impresses the most with its grand looking sets, environments (Egypt never looked more impressive on screen and this movie got hardly shot in Egypt at all actually) and all of its extra's. It uses 14,000 extra's in it, which really shows in some of its crowed sequences.The movie has plenty of big acting names in it. And even though most of the time and most of them are overacting, it's still a pleasure seeing all of those great names together on screen. Some of them are cast in, for them, some unlikely roles, such as Edward G. Robinson who most people were only accustomed to seeing as a gangster and Vincent Price and John Carradine, who both are best known for their work in the horror genre. But most of the actors also weren't really established names yet at the time. Just look at Yul Brynner, who had only just a few movies behind his name, prior to this one. But before this review is starting to take epic proportions, let me just end it by saying that this is one wonderful to look at overblown epic movie, that I was taken away by.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you get to know your way round classic cinema, sometimes you can imagine the personalities behind the productions just by watching the pictures themselves. By the mid-1950s, ancient world epics were becoming standard studio output and were being made in every way conceivable ? from canonically biblical to shamelessly pagan, from action no-brainer to meditative drama, everyone was doing it. Then into the arena steps an ageing Cecil B. DeMille, the man who practically wrote the rulebook on this genre. "Make way, make way!" he seems to be saying, "This is how it's REALLY done?" First of all, it's worth remembering that despite his overwhelmingly religious subject matter DeMille was never one to follow scripture to the letter. He was far too much of a colourful character (not to mention a commercial pragmatist) to do that. And he admits as much in his spoken preface to The Ten Commandments, saying how the bible omits large chunks of Moses' life, and his writers have plugged the gaps with various Hebrew texts. And then, in the opening credits, various sources are cited, before the announcement of "The Holy Scriptures" in bold font, like the headlining act at a concert. It wasn't that DeMille was disrespectful. In fact the opposite ? so convinced was he of the bible's literal veracity, it made absolute sense to him to weave its stories into those of any other historical text.Of course, DeMille was just the front man, and he got someone else to do the weaving for him. A gaggle of writers, including two of DeMille's favourites, Jesse Lasky Jr. and Frederick M. Frank, have constructed what is admittedly a sweeping, adventuresome biopic of the prophet. It is among the more dignified screenplays penned for a DeMille production, with no silly motivations or daft twists. The only thing which is a bit suspect is the dialogue, which is full of stupid and pretentious turns-of-phrase like "So, did you see the light after seven days of darkness?" Oh, and the characters are completely one-dimensional, but who needs more in such a comic book world? You see, DeMille's pictures aren't about thought-provoking depth. For him it's all about the presentation. DeMille was one of the most painterly directors out there, arguably even more so than Vincente Minnelli who was a painter in real life too. The Ten Commandments contains some of his finest classically inspired compositions. Aided by the breathtaking cinematography of Loyal Griggs, which creates whole areas of colour out contrasting light schemes, he evokes the religious artwork of the renaissance ? that of Michelangelo, Titian, Rafael, and many others who may or may not have had turtles named after them. DeMille is an artist as they were, but people and props are his brushstrokes. The movement in his shots is often stilted and theatrical ? just like it was in his earliest silent pictures ? so as to preserve that iconic look.With this in mind, it seems appropriate that DeMille's cast are bunch of posers, many of them wooden as mannequins. Charlton Heston, at this stage in his career, was little more than an impressive physique with an authoritative voice. Anne Baxter (she of the "bitch virtuosity" in All About Eve) gives probably the dullest performance of her life. John Derek is simply dull whatever he does, and incidentally his only "winning" streak was a string of Worst Director Razzies in the 1980s. Of the rest, most of them are actually very good ? especially Yul Brynner, Nina Foch and Edward G. Robinson (a real bit of genius casting as the conniving Dathan, but ridiculed at the time) ? but each of them is really there for their looks and general demeanour, not to act their hearts out. Think back to DeMille, the painter. When these people "act", their job is to strike poses that are symbolic rather than realistic indications of character. Hence we see things like a huddle of women stricken in awe as Moses makes his pronouncement ? imagery taken from stained glass windows, not from real life.The thing that is most revealing about DeMille, is that his grandiose presentation is entirely without discrepancy. At one moment, he reveals the majesty of God in a glorious sunset or a smouldering mountaintop, the next he is making us gape at the magnificent pagan idols of ancient Egypt. Even the debauchery of the golden calf scene is more alluring than reviling, and one gets the impression the DeMille was a bit more familiar with this sort of thing than he would have let on in public (and he was ? check out the Simon Louvish biography). And it's hard to know quite how to take the picture's casual acceptance of Old Testament misanthropy. It seems that, whether you are an atheist or a believer of any stripe, there is probably something for you to get offended by in The Ten Commandments. But you could look at it another way. You could ignore the context, and just enjoy the spectacle. Take DeMille's swansong for what it is ? good old-fashioned movie-making fun, done as only he knew how.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undeniably epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films are as epic as director Cecil B. DeMille's final film, The Ten Commandments. It's certainly epic in length, clocking in at a stunning 220 minutes. So yes it's a very long film, probably a little too long for its own good. There are good reasons you don't see Hollywood churning out 220 minute movies anymore. But while there are undeniable lulls in the story and there are times where you really wish DeMille could have moved things along a little more briskly in the end this is film-making on a grand scale. Everything about the film is grand...the sets, the effects, the cinematography, the costumes, the sheer multitude of extras who fill up the screen. Making this film today in the age of computer wizardry would be so much simpler. The fact that this film was made, and made so well, in 1956 seems almost miraculous.The film tells the Biblical life story of Moses and as such the film's title is somewhat misleading. Anyone familiar with the story of Moses knows that those famous stone tablets are not going to show up until rather late in the proceedings. If anyone's story could justify a 220 minute film it is Moses. It's all here, from his start as the baby in the basket to his final destiny. It's certainly a compelling story and DeMille brings it to wonderfully vibrant life, helped in no small part by the magnificent, powerful performance of Charlton Heston. Few actors would have been up to the task of performing this exceptionally challenging role. Heston pulls it off brilliantly. It's a performance worthy of the spectacle DeMille has created around him. And this film sure is a spectacle.In a cast of thousands Heston is the obvious centerpiece but there are may other standouts as well. Yul Brynner plays off Heston wonderfully as Moses' chief antagonist and rival for the Egyptian throne, Rameses. Brynner is strong, resolute and perfect for the role. So many other familiar names...Edward G. Robinson, John Derek, John Carradine, Vincent Price...the list goes on and on and each member of the cast does a great job. Nobody seems out of place. Aside from Heston and Brynner probably the most important role goes to Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, the Egyptian princess who desperately wants to be with Moses but who would be forced into marriage with Rameses should he ascend to the throne. In a film which is always solemn and serious Baxter adds what at times is a desperately needed lighter touch. Some may say her performance is a bit campy but in the grand scheme of things it works.Appreciate the spectacle. We'll probably never see a film quite like it again. That is not to say the movie is without failings. The story doesn't quite sustain itself all the way through, the first half seeming to be more compelling. The second half of the film, featuring the banished Moses in his return to Egypt and the freeing of his people from bondage, certainly has its moments. Most notable is the famous Red Sea sequence. But the pace of the film, which was never all that quick to begin with, really bogs down after a while. Taken as a whole it's a fascinating story. And DeMille spared no expense in making sure that story was brought to life in vibrant, spectacular fashion. As a spectacle it may be a film without peer. You just may be left with the sense that a few trims here and there would have been beneficial in keeping the story moving. But the positives certainly outweigh any negatives. It's a grand film which has stood the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie was when they showed it on television when I was in high school. I couldn't tear myself away from it until I had seen it all. Charlton Heston will forever be synonymous with Moses because of this picture. Much of this picture is conjecture since, as stated early in the movie, the Scriptures don't tell many details about Moses's life up until he boldly went to Pharoh and demanded, "Let my people go." But it is a gripping picture. I do think, though that this movie should have been titled EXODUS rather than the movie that later bore that title, because it seemed that the part where Moses actually brought down the Ten Commandments from the mountain was glossed over. It seemed as if there was more emphasis on the struggle to bring the Hebrews out of Egypt than on the Ten Commandments. Call it THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, call it EXODUS. Still a gripping picture that everyone should see at least once in their life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regardless of one's belief system, it is a near-impossible feat to argue with the sheer height of the production value. Costumes, sets, props, it's all incredibly well-done. The credibility and detail in it is top-notch. The scope of this is amazing. The material shot on location matches the rest so smoothly it is an accomplishment to determine where one ends and the other begins, without being informed by someone who is certain. I'm hardly the person who knows most about the tale told here, which does not mean I am the individual with the least knowledge of it either, but I would say, they depict a large portion, rather close to the entirety, herein. The plot is well-written and develops nicely, and those same qualities fit the characters, as well. The dialog contains lines from the original, and it is almost invariably very poetic. It's well-delivered by just about everyone, too. The acting in general is astounding. I doubt I could direct a single accusation of a half-hearted performance towards any of the parts in this. The score consists of grand instrumental pieces. The pace is a bit uneven, and with its length this can definitely be quite a mouthful. The effects, although I can't say for sure that none of them have since been touched up, as I watched this on a DVD recently released, are impressive, with few exceptions. Not all of the content in this is appropriate for all ages, though there is no nudity and little language. What violence there is has justification. I recommend this to those who want a well-visualized version, and, I'd presume, fans of the actor and film-makers. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ten Commandments is truly one of the greatest films in Hollywood history. The casting was excellent; especially Charlton Hestons's role as Moses. The performances of the beautiful Anne Baxter, lovely Debra Paget, and Yvonne DeCarlo were superb. I also admired the script. The sets were amazingly authentic, and I was pleased at that. However, as another user commented, it is not entirely correct. Pharoahs at the time were polygamists, thus many children. There were not just Rameses and Moses. There would have been perhaps thirty choices for Pharoah. For example, he was 40 when he killed the Egyptian, not 30. Moses stayed in the desert for 40 years, and returned to Egypt. His mother would not have lived during that time; even if she'd been 14 when she found him in the basket. There were also were several additions in The Ten Commandments not found in the Bible. However, I found that it made the story much more enjoyable on film. All in all, it was an excellent movie which I will always continue to love.</fullReview>

It's pure spectacle on a grand scale, rarely equalled in film history. Also, I find the score very moving and able to stand alone without the picture.

		<fullReview>Tried to watch this one on Easter Sunday evening once again but didn't quite make it...Mr. Heston's stentorian tones led to terminal torpor! But I do remember being rather outraged that this one got the Special Effects Oscar for 1956, beating out its only nominated competition: MGM's "Forbidden Planet" "They wuz robbed!" When I saw this on a giant VistaVision screen (probably correctly, i.e., horizontally, projected) during its first-run reserved seat engagement in Beverly Hills, California, I recall thinking that the special effects were not up to the standard of the sets, costumes, location work, staggering number of extras, "Et Cetera! Et Cetera! ET CETERAH!!" (as Yul Brynner would say in his incarnation as the King of Siam.) I still feel that "Forbidden Planet's" effects, though not as numerous and as ambitious as those attempted in DeMille's final testament, were MUCH better executed and deserved the Academy Award. Oh, well! Reading the other comments on this one is just about as entertaining as watching the cinematic epic itself. Great fun! Congratulations to all!!</fullReview>

He didn't want to believe he was meant to become the deliverer of his own people. The scene in which the both mothers appealed to him made a great influence on me. Also the "I am that I am" scene was marvellous.Again, the death of the first-borns in Egypt made me feel sympathy for the Egyptians.

		<shortDescription>The Biblical Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Yul Brynner in 'The King and I', Cecil B. DeMille decided to cast him as Ramsees in this biblical epic. From here, Brynner's career was set for the rest of his life. This four hour epic is arguably the spectacle of all biblical epics, and ranks alongside 'Ben Hur' as an epic film. DeMille's style is very stagey and Victorian in all of his films (with the exception of 'Samson and Delilah'), and makes you feel as though you are watching a Victorian stage play rather than a film. However, Yul Brynner's acting is second to none, and the dialogue between Ramsees, Moses and Pharoah is pure genius. It is arguably a culmination of all of DeMille's work, but certainly not his best. He approaches the film in a very scholarly manner, but does not leave behind his Victorian stage direction roots. In some scenes the dialogue and interaction between the characters rings bells of earlier films like 'The Plainsman' and 'North West Mounted Police', and surprisingly, the film does not build up to a climax as 'Samson and Delilah' did. The film does belong in the DeMille canon not because it is a self contained entertaining film, but because it is a culmination of all of his previous work, it is a biblical epic, and he approaches it from a scholarly manner. The one person that has DeMille to thank for establishing his career is Yul Brynner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the vastest Hollywood blockbusters of all time! You know the story, television was wiping out the old Hollywood movie business. So along came technology with huge screens, "cinemascope", lurid "technicolor" and scratch-your-eyes in disbelief special effects, to save the day! The result was an endless stream of movies that tried to match in breadth of drama or action the grandeur of the new movie experience. Most are long forgotten, but not this epic from the great Hollywood veteran Cecil B. DeMille! What could top this story direct from the Old Testament of the Bible? The political and sociological implications are profound, particularly given the film's release just over 10 years after the end of the Holocaust in Europe.Despite the extreme seriousness of the topics involved, what makes this movie tick is the bizarre love triangle of Moses, Nefritiri, and Ramses. And all three central characters are played to the hilt with over theatrical staginess by Charlton Heston, Ann Baxter, and Yul Brynner. Ann Baxter is spectacularly campy as the Egyptian Queen who longs for her childhood prince, Moses, despite her betrothal to Pharoah Ramses. Charlton Heston excells as Moses, he lives the part. And Yul Brynner is the perfect oriental despot.When I first saw this movie, as a child, I thought it ended less than half way through! The direction is tight and dramatic with plenty of little cliffhangers and at least one intermission (!) but remains riveting to the end. One of the best examples of the big last hurrah old Hollywood studio pictures! If you haven't seen it -- watch it now!</fullReview>

The clouds rolling in, Pharoah and his army approaching, the waters slowly starting to become turbulent. Then the formation of the "pillar of fire". The initial parting of the red sea was just one of the eye-popping visuals of this sequence. The many different shots of the walls of churning water were truly an amazing feat of matte photography.

		<fullReview>The Ten Commandments is one of the biggest films ever made. Whether it is one of the greatest or the best is another matter.Certainly its scale is still breathtaking; the scenes involving the construction of Seti's city are a good example. They do not serve to advance plot or character; we know that Moses is building a city, is a dutiful son, and we have already seen plenty of Hebrews groaning away at ropes too. However, De Mille allows us to share in the terror and excitement of the city's construction as the vast basalt pillar topples into place, reminding us that his business is constructing cities of dreams on the screen.At the same time as these magnificent set-pieces, the film has an epic structure, aiming to do justice not only to the whole of Exodus but a large degree of pseudo-historical reconstruction about Moses' life. It is here that the greatest weakness of the film lies; De Mille has enough material here to make three films. Would it be unkind to say that the mark of a film "epic" in the worst sense of the word is that it contains at least three "endings"?Here, we have Moses' early life brought to a triumphant conclusion as he meets God and returns to Egypt- and another film about the Ten Plagues starts. This is concluded by a superb procession of Israelites down the Avenue of the Sphinxes- then again, we have another grand conclusion as the waters of the Red Sea close over the Egyptian army. "His God... is God!" says Yul Brynner, utterly defeated, and we wait for the credits to roll. No- we suddenly remember the title of the film which we saw in the opening about a thousand years ago (well, three hours) is "The Ten Commandments". Now, film no.3 starts... By the time the Israelites have wandered for forty years in the wilderness and you have sat for four hours on the sofa, you can sympathise with their plight.In this respect, this film strains at the boundaries of its medium; it is simply too unwieldy a subject for a single sitting. It is far more effective if watched in around three or four hour-long portions. Then, you can understand not only the religious vision which underpinned the whole enterprise, but also the remarkable message of freedom and justice which runs through it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Films In Cinematic History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly one of the most awe-inspiring Biblical spectacles ever depicted on celluloid. De Mille succeeds in almost every way in bringing the Exodus of the Hebrews to life, and does it in full glory. Heston is incredible as Moses, and don't let his politics blur your image of him. He is convincing as Moses, and brings tingles up your spine when he utters almost every line. The parting of the Red Sea is still unbelievable by today's standards, and frankly, the entire film made me glad to know there is a God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jewish PROPAGANDA FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most unhistorical load of b.s. I have ever saw. The movie is dishonest, and a depraved film. Judeo-Christian audience loves this horrific propaganda film.It celebrates Jewish mass murder of gentiles, and promotes hatred towards non Jews.This is movie is based from exodus from the evil Hebrew bible. The purpose is show that Jews are good people, and Egypt is evil.In reality Egypt was sophisticated, and were the first ones to open medical schools.They are portrayed here as monsters, which is false.Moses is a schizophrenic fanatic.Who is righteous as much a fascist is.The movie is for a Jewish, Christian audience to celebrate there propaganda, and help spread this to non believers. The movie, and characters are stereotypical biblical fashion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic done wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that it can be hard to judge a film outside of its time. Visual effects, cameras, and acting have come a long way since 1956, but I do not like Cecil B. DeMille's "The Ten Commandments." This nearly 4 hour adaptation of the Exodus story has so many faults that are hard to ignore. I'm surprised it is such a classic.I do appreciate this film for how it advanced visual effects for its time. You can tell a lot of work was put into the set and costumes. The film looks good for the most part. However, it's a very slow moving and repetitive story with actors who either show no emotion or who are over the top. The Exodus tale is a very preachy story and this film feels very preachy. DeMille even comes out on screen before it starts and tries to make the story politically relevant. I'll admit that the Exodus tale is not one of my favorite stories and I'm not a religious person. It's a story of my god is better than your god that is unforgiving and DeMille seems to embrace it.Over the course of almost 4 hours, none of the really characters really develop except for Moses. However, Moses changes in a single moment instead of gradually. Charlton Heston isn't necessarily bad as Moses, but I felt like he was just playing himself. Kind of like John Wayne always the same character. All the other actors seem stale and the story takes too long to unfold. I felt like it gets caught up in the visual effects and sets, which hinders the story and characters.If you're a film buff, you should probably watch this movie just to see how innovative the visual effects were. I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone else though. I think Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and Simon Wells' "The Prince of Egypt" is a better adaptation of the Exodus story that does it in less than 2 hours. DeMille's "The Ten Commandment" is hokey and not thought provoking. It could have been great, but I think it's an epic done wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown, bombastic, cheesy - I love it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No-one could throw money at a cinema screen quite like De Mille. Whatever the merits and faults of this movie - and there are many of both - it is always going to stand a fair chance of succeeding simply by virtue of bludgeoning its audience into submission with sheer overkill. One suspects that even God didn't have this big a budget for Exodus! And that is responsible for some of the worst elements of the movie - garish vulgarity sometimes (often, in fact) overcomes good taste.But on the other hand, this epic was the movie which made Charlton Heston into the go-to guy for epics. His Moses oozes solemnity, sincerity and gravitas. And is very nearly matched by Yul Brynner's Ramses. If it wasn't for the fact that King Mongkut was the role Brynner was born to play, Ramses would have been that role.The film looks lavish and feels lavish. The effects are still spectacular even if they haven't all worn well.And it tells the story well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie, one of the best things in this great film must be, certainly, the costumes, the colors, the variety, all it's just great. The final scene in which Rameses's warriors attempts to pass across the sea, and God buries them in a water tomb it's a classic, a scene that I will never forget. I think that this is maybe one of the best epic movies i've ever seen, the performance of Charlton Heston it's great, always, Yul Brinner is also great as the powerful pharaoh Rameses. you have to watch this movie, if you believe or not in God, but it's a movie that will not disappoint you. the performance of the characters is great, the special effects, the costumes, all is perfect made to recreate one of the best biblical tales.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since i was a kid, i have seen this film every year with the same result. Awe stricken with the graceful pictures and wonderful story mixed with breath taking special effects. This story of moses was by far the best display of Hollywood magic other than Ben hur. A man born of a slave to be raised by a princess in the house of Egypt to avoid infanticide. Growing up to be a man and finding his roots by happenstance, had become the deliverer of his own people in a few years time from the whips and chains of their task masters to ultimate freedom. Charlton Heston was brilliant as the only man alive other than Jesus who saw the real face of god. And with this new faith went back to Egypt to have his people released from the vile clutches of Ramses. Yet to do this, he had to create a few miracles in that time to give the pharaoh the incentive to do so. But as with all powerful royal mongers he wanted more power, and was keeping the people for his own sake. But with moses the idea of plagues would have done it, but again, with power comes more power so ramses kept the people until his only son was killed from the last plague which ramses gave himself to thwart moses. When this happened of course the people were set free. I loved the way the sets were arranged where we see the people stand in such ways it was like looking at old paintings done by DA vinci or other renaissance painters. The images of miracles happening, and ex slaves watching in horror and awe of the power of god. Brilliant way to show a painting. I cannot understand why anyone would give this film just seven stars. It won numerous Oscars and to me this film will always remain the ultimate classic film.</fullReview>

How this isn't in the Top 250 is beyond unbelievable. Nope not Jewish, hating or anything. A boring white dude who knows a good story when it's told. To all the kids that can't stand that things aren't being blown up or going to see "Hannah Montana" Man that kid is going to be sick of being known for that by the time she is 20.

Is anybody trying anymore or kids don't care at all about story structure &amp; ridiculous NOT even Soap Opera worthy plot-lines? We will have to endure 80 minute films w/out credits &amp; actors trying to look happy that they are in another car movie. Seriously even if you can't appreciate this Flick yet, give it a try when you're older for all the right reasons. This is a film &amp; it is that good. $70 something million opening weekend here in the U.S. so we can expect, "Faster 2 the most Furious...err...9 &amp; they'll be serious in non-"Naked Gun" Joke Title Contest.

		<fullReview>I just watched The Ten Commandments again. This is my third time, because I wanted to give it a chance. Oh, come on, when will they make a really good remake of The Ten Commandments? I mean this 1956 version is so hammy and corny and steeped in such heavy handedness, that it really is the time for a good remake. Let me first say that all of the actors involved in this movie are very talented and the filmmakers are obviously gifted. It's just that the movie is so very self conscious (maybe because of the time), wanting to get the message across that it is kind of hard to watch. Of course, the special effects, given the time that it was made, were great. Again, great for that time. But this movie should not be about special effects. The effects should be a supplement. But even if it were for the special effects, then all the more reason to do a decent remake. Imagine what can be done now with digital effects? I heard that this movie did very well when it first opened, but I don't think that it would hold up today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the greatest of the biblical epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 film "The Ten Commandments", a retelling of a story he had previously filmed in the era of the silent films, is often regarded, and is regarded by myself, as the greatest of the biblical epics in film history, and there are quite a few of them. Charlton Heston plays Moses in a role just as fantastic as his role in "Ben-Hur", if not greater. Yul Brynner is the cruel, hard-heartened pharaoh of Egypt who refuses to let the Hebrew slaves go free, and all those that follow under the almost endless list of cast members are stars and long-remembered screen legends as well as faceless, nameless, but great performers who helped bring this epic to life.The film is quite an achievement in entertainment and this is really saying something concerning its length. DeMille's earlier version of the film was two hours in length and that was fairly long for a silent movie. His 1956 version is close to four hours long and yes, it does seem a little slow in a few places. I am a little thankful for the intermission, for it gives me a chance to get up and stretch my legs, because four hours is a long time to sit still. Regardless, afterward, I can sit down and enjoy the second half without faltering my enjoyment levels. There are a lot of wide-angle, one-camera shots with long speeches of well-acted dialogue scenes that may seem, and will inevitably be dull and uninteresting to some viewers, but to me, they were masterful. Anybody who appreciates great film-making, or respects the faith and events upon which this film is based, will cherish it.Special effects wise, the film is a noteworthy achievement given its age. Even fifty-two years after its big-screen debut, the effects are still impressive. The parting of the Red Sea sequence is simply spell-binding, even today. And if it's astonishing today, you can guarantee it awed the audiences in 1956. The sequence were Moses turns his staff into a cobra and then vice versa was also well-done and convincing.And of course, "The Ten Commandments" is fairly faithful, if not entirely faithful, to the story of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt. This is entirely necessary and even though it is not a big action-packed adventure story (don't be alarmed, there is some very entertaining action sequences) it still plays itself very, very well. The plagues are the same plagues described in the Bible, the characters are the same, the events are true.In short, "The Ten Commandments" is a masterful film. Even at four hours in running time, it plays itself out flawlessly as high entertainment and with great appreciation for the story of Moses and how he led God's children from bondage and the cruelty of slavery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ten Commandments on Two DVD's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many,I grew up watching (what I could stay awake through)The Ten Commandments every Easter on ABC. It's a bit difficult sitting through a film with so many commercial breaks from 6pm to almost 10:30 at night. Thus,that made it hard to really appreciate the film but I always stuck around for the parting of the Red Sea and the soldiers perishing under it's mighty waves. I also did and still do love it when Moses throws the tablets down onto the golden calf and all mayhem breaks loose for the Hebrews' sinful ways. Last Sunday (7/23/06)I finally watched the film on DVD. This was the 50th anniversary version with 2 discs. Part 2 starting when Moses is to return to Egypt. I can finally say without a doubt this is a very well done film for all it's expense and excess. I know for some it's easy to make fun of the acting or the dialouge ("Moses you wonderful crazy,beautiful fool! ...or such.) Not to mention the very few African's featured in the movie.Egypt being in Africa you'd think there'd be so many more! These things not withstanding,overall the story told here is an excellent one. When one is able to watch the film from beginning to end with only a momentary interruption,then it all comes together in a more satisfying way than when viewed on commercial TV. I finally can appreciate and understand what it's all about and enjoy the above 2 scenes I mentioned even more than before.I would say that if you haven't seen the movie or just not as much,watch it a few times because,there are so many in the cast that sometimes it's hard to keep who's who in check. Someone I watched with actually thought Anne Baxter was the same actress who discovers Moses on the Nile! To rate 10 Commandments less than 10 stars is like taking a Commandment away from the stone tablets themselves. (END)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course 1956 movie graphics were not as good as the modern technology we have today, but this movie didn't necessarily need anything modernly fancy, it's got Charleton Heston at his best along with Yul Brynner and others. I loved watching this as a kid, and even though i'm still quite young, I love watching it, as do my parents. A great movie classic for all. The script was well written, and amazing at how they portray the characters. Pretty sweet movie, I love it. Even if you've read the parts in the bible, you'll still be amazed at the movie and how great it is and how great it must have been in the 50's. Why i liked it pertains to a few reasons, one being that i really like the bible, and if anyone does, I'd recommend watching this one. Great story, flows well, something a whole family can sit down to one evening and watch. I have a wide range for movies, in the classic category, this is one of my favorites. If you love this movie, consider watching "Ben-Hur". sit down and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's DeMille...You'll Either Love It or Hate It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cecil B. DeMille was a master showman, rather than a great director, and his 1956 remake of "The Ten Commandments" is a whale of a show! Both pious and profane, posturing and sincere, it isn't great history, but it abounds in spectacle. While he was in poor health during the filming (suffering a seizure that was either a stroke or mild heart attack, while working under the 130-degree Eygptian sun), his distinctive 'style' was never more in evidence, with broad, overwrought performances, dazzling costumes and sets, monumental climaxes, and morals that are repeatedly hammered home. In 'classic' DeMille, there ARE no 'grays', everything is 'good' or 'evil', and 'evil' WILL be punished! Watching the film, you'll either enjoy the 'ride', or you'll groan, again and again. Personally, I love it, even with it's unintentional(?) campiness! Among my favorite 'so bad it's FUN' moments are 'Rameses' Yul Brynner and 'Nefretiri' Anne Baxter's frequent use of "Moses, Moses..." whenever he predicts something dire (Brynner looks like he can barely keep a straight face, uttering the phrase); 'Sephora' Yvonne De Carlo's stoic, yet impassioned pitch to Moses to marry her, always looking away 'into the future', I presume, when comparing her assets to Nefretiri's; 'Dathan' Edward G. Robinson's entire performance (nearly epic hamminess from one of America's finest film actors); Woody Strode's Ethiopian 'Princess' companion, who praises Moses' kindness with so much heat and honey that Nefretiri suspects he was fooling around, down south; and Sir Cedric Hardwicke's 'Sethi', turning an Eygptian Pharoah into a world-weary lovable executive-type (one can't help but wonder how Rameses could be HIS son!) Compared to Baxter's scenery-chewing, and Brynner's posturing, Charlton Heston's portrayal of Moses is so understated that he's often been criticized as 'wooden' in the role, which is unfair; while DeMille frequently posed him to match classic statues and paintings, his complete earnestness in the role, combined with his sheer physical presence, keeps him from receding into the background of the spectacle that surrounds him. Despite thousands of Eygptian extras portraying Hebrews during the astonishing 'Exodus' sequence, filling the screen, Heston always grabs and holds your attention; certainly no actor has ever been a more memorable Moses! The film has some very obvious merits; many of the special effects (particularly the 'Angel of Death' vapor, and the massive parting of the Red Sea) are still astonishing, today; Elmer Bernstein's score is an often 'over-the-top' joy to listen to; and the cast includes some very entertaining supporting players, including Nina Foch, Vincent Price, and DeMille's longtime associate, Henry Wilcoxon.Taken as spectacle, as a grand entertainment for the senses, "The Ten Commandments" is quite a show, and it's continued popularity over the past half-century is proof that many are still captivated by it.Cecil B. DeMille, master showman, knew his audience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OUTSTANDING DVD COMMENTARY TRACK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHAT does FAMILY PLOT (Alfred Hitchcock), POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (Frank Capra), RICH &amp; FAMOUS (George Cukor), THE LAST TYCOON (Elia Kazan), THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN (George Stevens), A MATTER OF TIME (Vincente Minnelli) and A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG (Charles Chaplin) all have in common with Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS??? Give up? Each listed film represents the final film made by a famous director. Only one of the titles would be considered its directors finest work. Katherine Orrison, Author of WRITTEN IN STONE--MAKING CECIL B. DeMILLE'S EPIC, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, points this out on the commentary track for the Special Collector's Edition of the DVD issued by Paramount Pictures in 2004. Not only is THE TEN COMMANDMENTS considred DeMille's finest film, but it certainly is his most successful from a commercial standpoint. Few, if any other, directors can lay claim to having their final work be considered their best.Katherine Orrison's commentary track is one of the finest every done for a DVD. She knows her subject backwards and forward. For almost four hours she shares fascinating tidbits about the making of the film, pointing out strengths and weaknesses. Orrison has done her homework, seeing the film numerous times with many who worked on the film, including actor and producer Henry Wilcoxon. I thoroughly enjoyed her commentary track and consider it to be one of the finest done for a DVD to date. She discusses why DeMille made changes to the known facts, such as having Moses do his own warnings before Pharaoh instead of have Moses' brother Aaron speak for him as the Bible records. Orrison loves the film and does not mock the Christian principles that it teaches. At one point she comments: "We don't choose God -- God chooses us." She believes in God and is thrilled and inspired by what DeMille has brought to the screen. While she points out weaknesses she is quick to praise the magnificence of the over-all effort. She explains that DeMille was very careful to make sure that the film remained suitable for children as well as adults. After sharing 4 hours with Orrison's commentary, I came away with a greater respect for what DeMille has achieved in his final film. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is certainly DeMille's outstanding sound film, while THE KING OF KINGS (1927) telling of the life of Christ is his finest silent film. It would be difficult to say which of the two is his greatest achievement.After watching and listening to the commentary track, I sent for a copy of Orrison's book (title listed above). The "Special Collector's DVD" and her book should make for a great combination in gaining an insight into one of the most fascinating films from this pioneer director. Thanks Paramount for this outstanding DVD edition -- certainly one of your best!</fullReview>

Yul Bryner is great as the film's antagonist, and yet he is not a villain himself. Most of the special effects are still good, including the parting of the Red Sea, the writing of the Ten Commandments and the shattering of the Ten Commandments.Hollywood certainly doesn't make them like this anymore.

		<fullReview>This movie is absolute FUN! I look forward to Easter or, in this case, Palm Sunday and Passover, because I know ABC will air this 4-hour blockbuster (only 3+ hours but ABC has to have its share of commercials) What makes this movie so much fun to watch is the story, some of the truly classic lines and the special effects. The story, as the title implies, is about the 10 commandments -- how Moses received them and what happened to the Hebrews who were enslaved by Egypt. In other words, the Exodus. (If you're looking for accuracy, you won't find it here but the movie is so good it doesn't matter). Some of the classic lines include Ann Baxter as Nefriteri replying, "I prefer him as a man" when Sethi says people would prefer Moses as a god. Also, "I love you. That's the only truth I know," she responds when Moses wants to know if she killed the old slave Memnet. And Yul Brynner calling her a "treacherous, sharp-clawed little peacock" and telling Nefriteri, "You're food for the gods and I'm going to have all of you." Lines like this are almost laughable and might be edited out of any other movie but for some reason, they fit in this film and they actually add to it.The special effects remain dazzling even in this day and age where you can have an entire movie with no real characters ("Finding Nemo" comes to mind). I still ask myself "How'd they DO that" when I see the famous parting of the Red Sea. Part of me wants to know and yet part of me would be terribly disillusioned if I found out. Even when Moses goes up to the burning bush with short-cropped hair and comes down with a salt-and-pepper lion's mane is amazing. And of course, turning the stick into a cobra and the other plagues that hit Egypt, are also amazing. I could say a lot more about this movie but suffice it to say this really is a terrific film, a lot of fun, a good, old-fashioned epic. It's a Joy to see such wondrous portrayals of Charlton Heston as Moses; John Derek as Joshua; Debra Paget as Lilia; Sir Cedrick Hardwicke as Sethi; Martha Scott as Yoshebel; Nina Foch as Bithia; Dame Judith Anderson as Memnet and, done with such delightful wickedness, Yul Brynner as Ramses; Edward G. Robinson as Dathan and Vincent Price as Baka. To add a cliche to this review: They just don't make 'em like this anymore. And that is too bad.</fullReview>

This film, for its time had everything, and everything is put together so well. It's not just the story of Moses, it takes you into the time with film techniques that were rarely used or unheard of for its time.Many people will not that some of the acting was "over the top". I think not, I feel the casting was deliberate for the characters. The direction was wonderful, I learned what "a cast of thousands" meant in the old Hollywood system. Every part of filmmaking was used to get this film to the screen, the music, the editing, the script, the sound, the animation, the costumes, the colors, the casting of white AND black actors...you name it, it's here. And let's be honest, there are some films based on stories of the Bible that are..okay, and some that should have NEVER been done. This is THE film that was done, and done almost perfectly. This film is grand, its epic, a MUST see whether you are religious or not. To me, one of the three best films of all time, ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This epic film has been a favorite of mine since I was young boy. The set designs are stunning and the musical score is appropriately majestic.Sure, the film takes cinematic licenses (the Bible says Moses was shy and had a speech impetiment, while Charlton Heston's voice rumbles with confidence) Yul Brynner is arrogantly excellent as Rameses while Victor Price and (surprise!) Edward G. Robinson are wickedly appealing in their roles.When you see the special effects, it's hard to believe that "The Ten Commandments" was made in 1956. The parting of the Red Sea and the earthquake near Mount Sinai are AWESOME! Many movies made today wish their special effects looked so good.Another element that sets "The Ten Commandments" apart is its heart. DeMille never forgets that this story is about faith and God's good overcoming man's evil. This film is deservedly considered a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>De Mille's final masterpiece, in a 45 year career of makingmagisterial epics of Americana; entertaining vast audiences overthree generations, and seldom coming up with a clinker in all thattime. Okay, maybe the Dr. Wassell picture, but that's it. This is epic filmmaking at its very best. You can take Lawrence ofArabia and stuff him a sack, cause this here's how you do it, David. Hardly a wasted moment in all it's 220 minutes, a superb cast ofveterans doing in many cases their best work to that time, the ageold story of Moses moving along like the everlasting Nile River thatfigures prominently in the sweeping saga Mr. De Mille so brilliantlyconveys. Heston is far better here than in the elephantine yawner BEN HUR,and Yul Brynner gave one of the best perfs of his career asRameses: "His God IS God." Eddie Robinson and Vincent Price make splendid villains; JohnDerek a stalwart hero; Debra Paget his lovely water girl; AnneBaxter Moses' gal; Cedric Hardwicke the Pharoah Seti; Nina Fochthe mom; Judith Anderson the too talky nursemaid, and on and on. A massive boxoffice hit for almost two years, and a spectacleworthy of the name. My #3 film of 1956. I see it every year on ABCat Easter, but it really needs to be in theatres again. Mr. De Mille ranks third on my all time Directors list. Since hepretty much co-invented Hollywood, #3 is probably too low. ButHitchcock and Hawks are one and two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical 50s Bible epic but still fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a colossal epic with one of the great special effects moments... the parting of the Red Sea. There are some flaws in it however. If you'll notice the water comes so close to Moses and the Hebrews when it closes back in on the Egyptians that they'd get swallowed up as well. The same goes with Yul Brynner on the opposite side of the sea. The point is they should have been positioned back a little further than they were. Aside from that, the story and the acting are still good. The scenes involving Anne Baxter's Nefretiri are some of the best scenes in the film. Being a romantic Nefretiri is determined to make Moses hers and she makes the audience really believe that she'll win his love. But in the end Moses is the out-and-out God follower and chooses glory over sex. Why in the name of God was Edward G. Robinson in this film? That is the only real problem I have with this movie. I hate Robinson enough as it is but then DeMille has to go and put him in an other wise good film and spoil a lot of qualities the film already has to offer. Yvonne DeCarlo as Moses' wife Sephora and Debra Paget as the self-righteous John Derek's love interest are very sweet but DeCarlo is more grounded and believable than Paget's drama queen Lilia. Martha Scott, who would go on to play Charlton Heston's mother in BEN-HUR three years later is his mother in this film too and plays it to the hilt with great emotion. An otherwise unknown actress Olive Deering is Miriam and plays her role in direct parallel to Heston's Moses, hammy and over dramatic. Heston himself has in general only one really strong attribute in this film: his physique. His chest and arms (not to mention his abs) are more in shape and defined better here than they were in BEN-HUR. Yul Brynner as always is in perfect physical shape and plays a tough Pharaoh without any mumbo-jumbo dialogue or any over-the-top gestures . In conclusion, DeMille made an enjoyable film that doesn't drag like most epics do and keeps the cast centered on their parts with a vengeance. He makes them project that they are playing historical individuals that made a difference in history once and can still make a difference today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason that the Ten Commandments is one of my favorite movies is the story-line for one, which is timeless. Prejudice, fear, greed and lust for power are themes that replay in history over and over again.There is a great attention to detail in the movie, which was obviously planned and executed with great care.I have seen this movie numerous times and still catch new details. For example, I noticed recently that the Sheik called his daughters back from chasing after Moses after he explained that he could not choose a wife yet.Mr. DeMille's commitment to quality and detail is a legacy for the film industry, I think.</fullReview>

The performances may seem comical but take into consideration that this was made in the early part of the fifties. But no one can deny that this film with its dazzling visual effects and breathtaking crowd scenes, would go down in history, as one of the most daring film ever done. We still see this every Holy Week, to record numbers at the box-office, the only film to do so in the Philippines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest spectacles in cinematic history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film continues to be a crowd pleaser after forty-plus years of annual broadcasts on network television. Cecille B. DeMille was probably the only director who could have got away with a Biblical epic such as this. The film certainly contains elements that are of a bygone era in filmmaking - the heavy-handed script, overstylized acting, silent-style extra acting, etc. However, the film is overwhelmingly the result of a film pioneers devotion to showmanship that will rarely be equalled in cinematic history. DeMille, was at time, the last of the film pioneers, and he more than anyone, had a sense of how to entertain the public. DeMille can be accused of cheapening the Bible for dramatic effect; but, in the end it is his faith in the storytelling that pulls this off and succeeds on many levels as one of the truly greatest entertainment spectacles in this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Proving that Steven Spielberg did not create The Hollywood Blockbuster, filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille constructs a biblical soap opera here with masterly aplomb, complete with awe-inspiring effects years ahead of their time. This celebrated remake of DeMille's own 1923 silent epic stars Charlton Heston (and his jaw of granite) as Moses. Heston doesn't act, exactly, nor does he imitate anybody else; the star plants his feet firmly in the dirt and reads his lines with stoic professionalism (with the earnestness of someone who innately believes he really is heroic). Heston could pull this role off in a community theater and get raves. It's a celebrity-spotting religious opus which has Moses leading his people out of Egypt, and the ham-handed script and florid trimmings have thrilled and amused a lot of people over the years. The film is still shown yearly on network television, and the colors and pageantry almost make up for the complete lack of spontaneity or wit. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful and Terrible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this picture many times, including in its original release (when I was 4 years old) but perhaps the most revealing viewing was in the large theater on the Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood. The setting influenced me to look at it not merely as a story, but as a "production," and seen in that light, I was able to understand the conflicts I've always sensed about this film.DeMille was a brilliant producer. He could bring together the film-making elements with a completeness and vision that few could match. He was also a talented visual story-teller. He was also, when this film was made, probably the longest-practicing director in the business, rivaled only (perhaps) by King Vidor. He was the definition of Old School.The film is the most curious amalgam of genuine religious belief and genuine showmanship. He knew the message, and he knew how to get people's attention. He brought the two goals together with the simple arithmetic that is the basis of Hollywood business, and is often the undermining of cinematic chemistry and the undoing of Hollywood art.It must be stated that this film contains a few bits of the most outrageously ridiculous dialogue ever filmed. There is something inherently inappropriate about addressing the giver of the founding laws of Western civilization with the words: "Moses, you adorable fool, kiss me." It must also be stated that this film is one of the most awesome and successful acts of film production ever brought off. That was what I realized while watching it within the gates of the Paramount lot. There's a scene where Moses, in his Architect phase, is in his architectural office having a discussion with Nefirtiri. While the two of them work through their frustrated passion, one might notice that in the background, seen through a window, about a half-mile away, 3000 extras are building pyramid. Nobody else made movies quite like DeMille.DeMille keeps this film visually riveting throughout, and it keeps getting better as it goes along. As a visualization of the great biblical story, this is about as good as it gets. If you saw it without being able to understand the dialogue, it would still be enthralling.What ultimately almost wrecks the drama of the film is not the profane ridiculousness of the dialogue or the sexy love-story that seems sacrilegiously embroidered into a holy tale. It is, rather, the genuine piety of the film-maker.The first part of the movie, the story of Moses' search for his real identity and the true meaning of his life, is a great drama. It is well-structured, well acted, and dressed with an inimitable production to give it a sense of reality and greatness. Then, Moses goes up the mountain, listens to the Burning Bush, and comes down gray-haired and radiating divine light.From this point on, Moses has become too holy to suffer any dramatic conflict. As a result, Drama flees from him as though he had some terrifying disease. The movie loses its dramatic center, in the personal sense. The "drama" of the Hebrews escape to freedom and their testing and travails is all there, to be sure, but the personal level of drama, which drove the first half of the film, no longer has its central character.The Drama searches for another center to hold onto, but it never really finds one. Pharaoh Rameses makes a good try (and Yul Brynner certainly steals the movie in terms of his performance), but he's not allowed to succeed in becoming the dramatic center because he's the villain. Dathan (Edward G. Robinson almost steals the movie, and would have succeeded if he'd had a larger part) takes a shot at being a dramatic center, but he's not allowed to because he's a secondary villain.As a result, the terms of the film shift completely. The personal drama set against an epic background becomes an Epic without a personality. (And here I use "epic" in its true definition, the story of an entire people.) In all, I still think it's a film not to be missed, especially if there's an opportunity to see it on a real movie theater screen. Despite its problems, it's a fabulous experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, The Bad , The Ugly....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK If you have seen this giant epic, you know it has a cast of thousands, a star filled principle cast in the main leads, that for the most part does alright... The biggest problem with this dated epic is the director, old Cecil B DeMille had done these type of films for over 30 years and most of his other huge films are a lot more stiff than this one, but he did save some his best work here for last. (Cecil only lived 4 more years, his work finished) I think DeMille's best work was his 2nd to last film "The Greatest Show on Earth" , but that's just me. Blame DeMille for endless posing by Heston, Brynner. Both turn in great performances here, and should not be penalized by the constant distractions by Demille's heavy handed direction. Having seen this film at least 30 or more times since I was a child (Im only 2 years younger than the film) and being a film buff, I am very familiar with all the other work done by the cast. So here goes,,,,The Good...Heston, Brynner, Martha Scott, Yvonne DeCarlo, John Carradine,Henry Wilcoxon , Nina Foch ,Judith Anderson, Debra Paget, all turn in very good to decent performances here,,,, ,,,If you bear in mind they are limited by the script here (more on that later) The costumes are great..Edith Head with the help of many others did a wonderful job here. The sets are nothing short of magnificent,, and the special effects were state of the art for the time. The Parting of the Red Sea is still impressive. Original Music by Elmer Bernstein adds to the movie. The art direction is very well done, and the Cinematography by Loyal Griggs is quite good. All of these elements still hold up today...and its a lot of fun trying to spot all the other notable actors and actresses in bit parts in this film, such as Woody Strode, Clint Walker, Robert Vaughn, Mike Conners ,Gail Kope, Onslow Stevens, Michael Ansara, Richard Farnsworth ( as a Chariot driver) Kathy Garver (Cissy on Family Affair), Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer (Yes that Alfalfa from "Our Gang" ,who was shot to death at the ripe old age of 31 during a disagreement over payment for a hunting dog!!!,,,and in a strange twist of fate died the exact same day as director Cecile B. DeMille, Jan 21, 1959...go figure who got the front page headlines the next day...not Alfalfa) and last but not least Herb Albert as Drummer on Mt. Sinai ,,,no trumpets back then,,,The Bad...The Script ,,,, I see where there were no less than four people who wrote this screen play this, and this element adds to the bloated feel of this film , along with DeMilles Direction. Perhaps if they had called in some real talent to work the script (Joseph L. Mankiewicz comes to mind) it would have added to this film , not detracted from it,,which this script does in abundance at times...DeMille,, He meant well, and was totally committed to bring this to the big screen using all his talents (but this sword cuts both ways) Some of his scenes work beautifully,mainly the ones were fewer actors/actresses are involved, but as the big crowd scenes get bigger and bigger, his direction becomes more and more stagy to the point of camp.John Derek,,,( Who could'nt act his way out of a wet paper bag) shows us once again he is great to look at for the ladies, but has the depth of a kiddie pool.... (Replacing him with someone like Jack Palance would have done wonders to the role of Joshua)Anne Baxter,,,Poor Anne, she is total camp here.she had the talent (see "All About Eve) but she seems to be in on the joke, as her version of Nefertiri is laughable. (Ava Gardner or Rita Hayworth would have been a better fit for this role)Vincent Price,,,woefully miscast here as Baka,,,,(Someone like Lee Marvin or Richard Boone would have added some nice spice to this sadistic heavy)Cedric Hardwicke,,,,Oh he looks the part,,but is so boring as Sethi...(insert Fredric March )Edward G. Robinson,,,Everyone likes to pile on here. Yes . Edward does come across as a leftover gangster here, and seems to be in on the joke with Anne Baxter. (I can see George Sanders being perfect for this role, and why not as DeMille had used him before in "Samson and Delilah".The Ugly...With all the good intentions here, there are blatant false story lines as pointed out by many other reviewers,,,,at least get the story straight.The Bigger the crowds, the more action, Demille gets more and more stagy here. As many bad actors shout out their one line on cue without any flow whatsoever.,,,but then again that's just DeMille for ya&gt;&gt;&gt;Cecil B. DeMille ...Narrator....just does not work (please send in Orson Welles or John Huston)All in All , I still enjoy watching this film,,the good points vastly outweigh the rest...a Classic,, and a one of a kind epic...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ten Commandments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I am not religious, this film, in its grandiosity and scope is very compelling. Charleton Heston proves his ability to play a larger than life character. What I wonder about is why it took God 400 years to free the Israelites? And then forced them to wander for 40 years in the desert before leading them to the promised land (golden idle aside). One could make cynical remarks that a man who prays to God to see the 'deliverer' before he dies, and then accidentally sees that 'deliverer' before he dies, yet he isn't made aware of it. The other actors in the film, flush it out fully. Every special effect in this film was done in the real world - no CG. Its too easy for us now to watch movies filled with CG effects and view them as 'real.' If the movie seems a bit pompous and corny to the 21st century viewer, it can only be because the 21st century viewer has lost his or her innocence and watches from a more jaded and cynical perspective. This film still resonates with me, and I enjoy watching it about 6 times a year--have the DVD. Sadly, there will never be films made like this again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fan's Notes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to echo the the positive comments posted here. (Pick any of them)If you haven't seen this, where have you been? This is great screen entertainment. 'The kind of movie they don't make any more.'One of the criticisms (by some) is the melodramatic and over-the-top screenplay which, to me, is one of it's enduring assets. It's indicative of DeMille's greatness that he got the script he wanted and the actors who, with the scenery firmly between their teeth, gave it their best shot - and on target all the way. Like many others, I can laugh at some of the dialog when I'm away, but become an avid believer when I view the picture for the umpteenth time. Is this not great Art?Another aspect of the picture I noticed (after an embarrassing number of viewings), is that each shot is staged like a Silent Movie. It's none the worse for that as in every respect it is a modern (or at least a 1956 modern) movie. But it's staging might be one of the subconscious contributions to it's timelessness.Along with the above, notice how few close-ups there are. When DeMille has a close-up it means something and advances the plot. Contemporary film-makers take note!Also these days we hear a lot about 'ensemble' acting. I guess that means there are more than three people with five or more lines that are involved in the plot and appear together in a few scenes. This is one of many examples of DeMille's penchant for 'ensemble' acting. And with this high-powered cast, ensemble par excellence.One of the things I didn't notice until later, was that the film was pretty much shot in the studio. The memorable vistas of the Exodus, the "Treasure City" of Seti, and Moses' exile don't take up that much screen time. This is a tribute both to DeMille's storytelling ability (keeping our mind on the subject at hand) and the excellent Art Direction and Set Decoration of Paramount Pictures (I don't think they won any Oscars either). Yet there is never a studio-bound feeling on the part of the viewer. Great cinematic Art indeed. If this story takes place in Ancient Egypt, by God we're going to see Ancient Egypt. And we do.The story, concept and execution are so Big, that one does not notice that on the big screen the aspect ratio is around 1:1.85. The advantage is there is little or nothing lost on the TV screen. In fact when I saw this after a long while in a movie theater, I only briefly noted that it wasn't as wide as I had expected. If you get a chance to see this in a movie theater - Go.Finally the biggest tribute I can make to this great picture is that it was Charlton Heston's 'Finest Hour'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular &amp; impressive epic but not entirely Biblical truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film at the small town theatre near my rural home when I was but a little girl, such a treat. Of course I've watched it a few times on TV since, and it's always impressive.The movie chronicles the story of the Exodus..from baby Moses' adoption by the Pharaoh's sister...to his realization that he is in fact Hebrew himself and not really Egyptian...to his exile as an adult from Egypt for murder...to his marriage in the desert to a local girl...to his return to Egypt, at God's command, demanding the release of the captive Hebrews...to all the plagues, the Passover, and the massive exodus of the Hebrew slaves from the land of their captivity....to their trials along their journey to the Promised Land and the eventual giving of the Law on Mount Sinai. Charleton Heston is compelling in the role of Moses and Yul Brynner (complete with ponytail) as his opponent, the Pharaoh Rameses II.It's a veritable epic, a spectacle, with dramatic scenes brilliantly capturing Ancient Egypt. Who could fail to be impressed by the Burning Bush, Moses converting his rod into a serpent, the turning of the Nile River into blood, the eerie and dramatic Passover of the Angel of the Lord, the parting of the Red Sea? Amazing effects for that era! My most memorable picture, however, is the lightning like engraving of the Ten Commandments by God on those twin tablets of stone.My only complaint is that the first couple of hours of the movie are basically pure fiction, not Biblical truth at all. To the best of my knowledge, there is no Biblical basis whatsoever for the attraction and romance between Moses and Nefretiri; yet it dominates the entire first portion of the movie. The producers should have cut the film in half and stuck to the facts as presented in Scripture; they're certainly dramatic enough by themselves, without embellishment. Unfortunately, many viewers will probably consider the entire movie pure Scriptural truth.In any case, this is a great mega film. It paints a vivid portrait of the cruel oppression of the Hebrew slaves by their Egyptian masters, the obstinacy of the arrogant Pharaoh's heart, the dramatic plagues, and the mass exodus. Above all, it gives the viewer a sense of the mighty power of a just but loving God and His compassion for His oppressed people. Just don't get your Biblical facts from it.</fullReview>

As M becomes more God-like, alas, he also becomes less interesting. At movie's end, the wife (Lili Munster?) says how much she loves him, and it's a tough line to swallow in any century. She may as well proclaim her love for the two granite tablets.The movie is saved by its villains, particularly the eternally bald Yul Brynner, who depicts bludgeoning stubbornness so well we assume he was like that in real life, and the smarmy Edward G. Robinson, to whom God must also have been speaking, perhaps in the Brooklyn patois.Anne Baxter as Nephritiri (silly me, I thought the 'ri' was supposed to be a 'ti") is delectable throughout the movie, from princess to queen to Mom.

		<fullReview>There have been bigger epics ("Heaven's Gate" and the Russian version of "War and Peace"); There have been higher awarded epics ("Titanic", Gone With the Wind", "Ben-Hur"); And there have been glossier epics ("Star Wars", "Jurassic Park", "The Fellowship of the Ring"). But NEVER have I seen a movie that more clearly defines what an epic is. Epics are big, bold, and brassy, and Cecil B. Demille's last film is probably his most magnificent attempt. You want big? Check out the cast! Start with three Oscar winning stars (Charlton Heston, Yul Brenner, and Anne Baxter). Add some of Hollywood's greatest supporting players (Edward G. Robinson, Vincent Price, John Carradine, and Yvonne DeCarlo). And also the only movie I can recall where the cast included both a knight (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) AND a Dame (Judith Anderson). Bold? Look no further than Cecil B. himself. The man lived to make three hour movies. His specialty was directing more masses that any ten directors put together, hence the remark "I must have killed more men than Cecil B Demille" in "Blazing Saddles". Also the blaring score of the young Elmer Bernstein, who seems to have trumpets blowing every five minutes. Brassy? The special effects blow away any competition of the 1950's, including "The War of the Worlds". The parting of the Red Sea is still Hollywood history, but the writing of the Commandments themselves is also worth viewing. Unfortunately, the beautiful visuals of "The Prince of Egypt" have tended to remove some of this movie's shine, but it is still worth the viewing. The dialogue certainly could have been better written in some parts, but Heston still sounds great pronouncing King James' english. Although the movie is mostly about showing off the big budget, the movie's two most moving scenes are when Moses tells Seti off about Egypt's slavery, and the love scene between Moses and Sephorah. When Moses talks of God not wanting slavery "to be so", you can feel the conviction of our own nation's transgressions in this matter. The love scene is quite tender and moving as Sephorah tells Moses that true beauty comes from the character within, not the looks without. For us Bible Believers, this is probably as ambitious a visual attempt of scripture as we will get until we see the Bible's characters "then face to face".

Among the things that I point out is the fact that in the story of the Exodus, Pharoah's wife is barely mentioned. In the film she is one of the featured characters, and she's even portrayed as the scorned lover of Moses. Also, there is barely any mention of why Moses never entered the promised land.

Of course the movie is silly, overblown, and not particularly accurate. But let's face it: This is the Bible done by Hollywood!! God has an uncredited bit part and can't even get on the marquee!!(Heston had a better agent!). This is not a deep personal film that delves into the complexities of human faith. It's a film parading a lot of male and female pulchritude, with betrayal, standing-by-your man or woman, the finger of God bashing the Ten Commandments into stone, the Red Sea flowing backwards, and a burning bush. The film critic Pauline Kael once said something along the lines of: Since great films are so rare, if you can't enjoy good trash, why go to the movies? Her review of The Ten Commandments indicates that it sits proudly in the great trash category. So sit back, eat popcorn, get an extra pillow for your tush, and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cecil B. DeMille apparently was attempting a real time film version of life.This film goes on, and on, and on, apparently so the cast of familiar faces can get into their "period costumes" and preen on camera for few minutes. There are a few actors whose first appearances on screen made me laugh out loud (most notably Vincent Price, John Carradine and Edward G. Robinson). For me, the only interesting thing about this film were those few actors who strove mightily to provide some depth to their characters, especially Yul Brynner as Rameses and Anne Baxter as Nefretiri. Despite their best efforts, this film plods along like a 1950's luxury car -- slow to accelerate, covered with unnecessary chrome and decked out with tail fins. Don't invest the time it takes to watch this dog. Read the book instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A biblical epic or epic proportions as only C B DeMille can do.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even when I was a child and saw this movie when it first came out, I was thoroughly disappointed -- the book is much better. Cecil B DeMille's second take of this theme is at least a tad bit less hokey than his first, the silent version, but that isn't saying much. The dialog is terrible, the set design way over the top, and most of the acting is so theatrical as to be laughable. Who can't chuckle when Edward G. Robinson speaks to Moses with his gangster accent? And Ann Baxter is dreadful as she overplays her role, running around crying "Moses! Moses!". The saving grace is the performances of the two leads, Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston, who were powerful enough stars to actually keep DeMille from ruining their performances. Lots of stars in this one, and the special effects are all right as far as they could be for 1956. Sorry folks, but just because it was an epic film endeavor by a major Hollywood director and based upon a story from the Bible, this is still a dud. DeMille never learned to let dialog speak for itself, and always had his actors overplay their roles. Still, you need to see it once to satisfy the purists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no denying the gift of Cecil B. DeMille in fashioning vivid screen entertainment. That's what most people want, after a hard day's work: something to enjoy and distract the attention from serious contemplation.One might venture a guess that over 95% of viewers of DeMille's remake of his earlier "The Ten Commandments," find this 1956 film just fine, if not outstanding. It's got seemingly everything needed for great entertainment. How can anything too harshly be said against it?Amidst the dozens of glowing comments, comes one on the amazon.com site, which states, in part: "Literal interpretations of mythology like this perpetuate crimes against humanity . . . tell a [fallacy] enough times and people begin to believe it . . . so many actually begin to believe this really happened . . "This statement emerges like a voice crying in the wilderness; yet it carries implications of depth and wisdom. Here's a viewer who is able to go beyond the crafty showmanship, technical wizardry, and mammoth production values of this product, to discern its essence, and then express his/her feelings honestly.It's a statement worthy of meditation, when one has the willingness to take the time to quiet one's thoughts and focus in on inner harmony. Granted, it's a challenge, pitted against the sound, fury, and spectacle of this presentation.For those few seeking enhanced awareness, however, it's well worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the Ten Commandments. It is a movie filmed in the 1950s, one my dad's favorites. I am amazed by how the visual effects were so good back then. The parting of the sea was not as good as it is now, but I am amazed that they could do that with such little technology. This is a summary of the movie: Moses was cast in the Nile in a basket. His mother was protecting him from being killed by orders of the Egyptian Pharaoh. An Egyptian princess finds him and takes him as one of her own. As Moses grows to become a great general, he falls in love with Nefretiri. While an old woman, who was actually his mother, was working on a pillar, she was almost crushed to death. Moses saw this and told off the supervisor. He then met Joshua, who tells him about God. Moses really wanted the slaves to not endure so much suffering in their work. Ramseses calls Moses the "Deliverer". Moses was the person to fulfill the prophecy. Memnet tells Nefretiri about how Moses is a Hebrew. She kills him. Moses goes to his family and realizes that he is a Hebrew. Liliah is engaged to Joshua, but Baka tries to capture her. Joshua saves her but is captured instead. Moses rescues Joshua but kills Baka. Dathan hears Moses telling Joshua that he is a Hebrew. Moses is arrested, but he claims that he only wants to free the slaves. Moses is sent to the desert and comes to the land of Midian. He meets several girls and he learns that their father is a Hebrew. Moses marries one of the daughters. When Moses was taking care of the sheep, he saw a burning bush. It was God's voice telling him to free the Hebrews. Moses returns to Egypt, but the pharaoh wouldn't let Moses' people go. Ten plagues were then set upon Egypt. The pharaoh's first born dies. He was so distraught that finally he let the Hebrews go. Moses parts the Red Sea and the Hebrews run to the other side of the sea. But as the pharaoh's warriors followed them, the sea closed and they drowned. As Moses goes up to Mount Sainai to receive the Ten Commandments, his followers built the Golden Calf. When Moses finds out, he becomes furious and throws the tablets at the Golden Calf, causing it to explode. God sends them to wander around the desert for 40 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the widest of widescreen guilty pleasures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cecil B. DeMille reads between the lines of Holy Scripture and rewrites the Book of Exodus, with enough color, claptrap, and spectacle to fill several bibles. In a modest prologue the director himself introduces the film, claiming it to be "based on historical documents", including one particularly Gnostic text which (quoting Egyptian princess 'Nefretiri') refers to Moses as a "sweet, stubborn, adorable fool".The production is a textbook exercise in epic entertainment, with Charlton Heston stepping into the mighty sandals of Moses and leading the nation of Israel out of Egyptian bondage, parting the Red Sea along the way. After such a show-stopping climax the encore carving of the actual Commandments atop Mount Sinai can't help but seem anti-climactic, and still requires some clarification: what kind of example does the Author of 'thou shall not kill' set by slaughtering the firstborn of Egypt and drowning half the Pharaoh's army?DeMille approaches the story with all the gravity of a religious crusade, which of course only amplifies its many guilty pleasures. The film was made for true believers, but perhaps only an unrepentant freethinker could appreciate such hammy declamation of truly classic cornball dialogue. And with a running time of 3-hours and 39-minutes, thank the Lord His inventory of commandments ended at ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film more than a dozen times, it's one of my very favorites, but not for the same reasons as most of the other reviewers here at IMDb. Since childhood I have found this film absolutely hilarious. It's simply the most over-the-top, overblown spectacular from a director who's famous for his spectaculars. The cast of well-known and mostly accomplished actors were given full rein to ham it up to their hearts' content, and boy did some of them do just that. Anne Baxter is a particular standout as Nefretiri, overdoing both her early adoration of "Moses! Moses! Moses!" and her later villainous desire for revenge when he declines her love in favor of his God. Heston runs her a close second, no scenery is ever safe from this man's teeth, and he really sinks his teeth into this role of a lifetime. I especially love the way that his deepening religious inspiration is indicated primarily by the ponderousness of his voice and the length and whiteness of his beard. Edward G. Robinson also deserves honorable mention as the Hebrew "trusty" collaborating with the Egyptian oppressors. Even as great an actor as Yul Brynner is hysterical when having to deal with such an egregious script ("So let it be written", so let it be bad). Cecil B. DeMille provides his own ridiculous narration, filled with pseudo-Biblical language, and things that sound like quotes but in fact aren't.The only thing that bothers me about this film is not the film itself, but the reaction of much of the American audience. They think this thing is an accurate reflection of the Biblical story of Moses and the Exodus. It's not at all, adding in tons of Hollywood romance and action that isn't there, and leaving out plenty of narrative that is there. Of course, that isn't really a problem historically because there's not a shred of archaeological evidence that Moses ever existed or the Exodus ever took place. But don't try to tell that to the American public; they aren't interested in facts, just mythology, and that's what one gets here in spades. Highly recommended to those with the wit to appreciate great camp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Impressive If Very Imaginative Spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie is a little bit like sledding downhill. At the beginning it's quite exciting and a lot of fun, but as you approach the end, the sled starts to slow down and eventually goes out with a whimper. The first half of Cecil B. DeMille's "The Ten Commandments" is very interesting, attempting as it does to fill in the many gaps in the story of Moses, about whose early life we read very little in the biblical story, which skips over everything between Moses being discovered by Pharaoh's daughter to the point at which Moses joins his people in the fields. DeMille fills that time in quite imaginatively, and I must say that, in spite of the rather grandiose claim at the beginning of the movie that the story is based on history and Scripture, I think the bulk of this part of the story is based on DeMille's imagination. Nevertheless, it's quite entertaining and moves along at a good pace. Charlton Heston is - in my view - more accomplished as this young Moses than he was as the older Moses later in the film, when his makeup came across as increasingly unbelievable, to the point at which, at the end, he looked a bit like Santa Claus with the typical fake white beard and hair. Yul Brynner was quite believable as Rameses as was Nina Foch as Bithia. The introduction of a romance between Moses and Nefertiti (Anne Baxter) was not really necessary - a battle for the throne between Moses and Rameses would have been sufficient without a battle for a girl to go along with the throne. Still, the first half is pretty good.Things go off track a bit, though, starting I thought with the plagues sent upon Pharaoh and Egypt. They were skipped over rather quickly (with the exception of that against the firstborn) and the whole movie seemed to start to jump around a bit after this. DeMille didn't have as much free reign with the story at this point, because the biblical narrative, of course, is well known, but he tries to adapt it subtly but noticeably. Just one example of the adaptations is the golden calf story, which DeMille has preceding the giving of the Ten Commandments to the people, while in the Book of Exodus, that actually happens 12 Chapters after the giving of the Commandments. DeMille also has God carving the Ten Commandments on a stone and giving them to Moses to take to the people, whereas the Book of Exodus has God speaking the Commandments to all the people who are gathered at the foot of Mt. Sinai. I suppose one has to give credit to DeMille, because as a pastor I've noticed that his version of the giving of the Commandments is the dominant image that people have drilled into their heads - even those who are pretty biblically literate. DeMille also clearly portrays Moses as an archetype of Christ, starting with his birth being foretold by a star and Pharaoh being warned about the coming of a deliverer to the Hebrews, which causes Pharaoh to launch a plan to kill the male Hebrew babies (a la Herod in the Gospels after the birth of Jesus.) The problem is that according to Exodus 1 the reason for the killing of the male babies had nothing to do with the fear of a deliverer but was rather to slow the population growth of the Hebrews.Faults aside, this is a pretty good movie. I liked Edward G. Robinson's take on the character of Dathan, a Hebrew overseer of the slaves who becomes the one who constantly stirs up the people against Moses. It was also interesting to see Vincent Price in a role unlike his usual horror roles as the Master Builder Baka. With repeated messages from Heston about the evils of slavery and the equality of races, I found myself wondering what type of reception this movie would have received in the South in 1956. Overall, it's a very impressive movie, rightly called a spectacle, and even if it does slow down as it moves along, it's still worth 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather Over the Top, but Heston as Moses Parting the Red Sea Worth a DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a challenge for 21st-century audiences to absorb the epic CinemaScope extravaganzas that were made in the 1950s. For some reason, filmmakers of that time felt compelled to apply the grandeur of their stories with about 4000 sledge-hammers. If there is anything that can be said of Cecil B Demille's 1956 remake of his silent epic, it gets straight to the point. Film-goers wary of subtlety need not worry about losing their entertainment investment. However, if your taste is for delicate sensitivity, complex character development, and the blurring of "good" and "evil", this might not be quite the film for you. Let's face it, none of the characters depicted in the Book of Exodus in the Old Testament are terribly multifaceted. Moses was good and on the side of God, and Ramses II was not only evil but vain. I guess in biblical terms, the two go hand-in-hand.That said, it is almost impossible to imagine any other acting except Charlton Heston being able to portray Moses and pull it off without it getting cheesy. Like Jesus of Nazareth, George Washington, and even Superman, Moses is almost beyond casting because of his wide-spread legendary status--among the religious and the non-religious alike. And yet, Heston seemed born to play the Jews' most revered figure. There is a biblical flair to Heston. Although he is not a great character actor like an Edward G. Robinson (who also stars) or a Dustin Hoffman, Heston is one of a handful of film performers whose mere presence is enough to fill the movie screen. Sometimes you wonder that the screen doesn't burst at the seams when one of these guys walks into it. And that is very much how a lot of Jews and Christians see Moses: as this larger-than-movie-screen figure. And the scene where he parts the Red Sea is one of the great cinematic triumphs of the 1950's.The supporting cast is also terrific, particularly Yul Brynner as Ramses II who brings an appropriate exotic flair juxtaposed to a conniving selfishness as an Egyptian prince then a Pharaoh. Anne Baxter as Nefretiri and Edward G. Robinson as an Egyptian citizen turned Hebrew sympathizer (sort of) are worth honorable mention.The wonderful aspects of this movie are the spectacles. The large Egyptian cities, the Egyptian throne room, the Voice of God (apparently also Heston), the creation of the stone tablets, and of course the Parting of the Red Sea. And, I should mention, hearing Heston say the famous line which we still repeat thousands of years after the fact: "Let my people go." is definitely worth the price of the Special Edition DVD.Now, the weaknesses. First and foremost is the narration, which I assume quoted passages from the Book of Exodus. The narration for me was not only over-the-top but superfluous. In many of the narrated moments, the narration simply described exactly the on-screen action. In one sequence, when Moses has been exiled from Egypt, he wanders through the desert nearly dying of thirst, and the narration says he wandered through the desert dying of thirst. I think I got the point. At times I wanted to mute the sound and just watch. In the 1950's, a lot of these kinds of films included narrations, a stylistic convention of the time that has not withstood as well for later audiences. Modern audiences become impatient (maybe even insulted) with on-screen omnipresent narration unless they truly add something above and beyond the action. Did filmmakers really believe their audiences were too dumb to figure things out?Another aspect that unfortunately dates the film is the music. It seemed every time Moses opened his mouth for a revelation, giant brass choirs belted out the musical theme of the movie, followed by large cymbal crashes with trills in the woodwinds and tremolos in the strings. Ad infinitum, over and over again. Having hours of triple-forte music gets a little grinding. The huge tutti passages made sense at the Parting of the Red Sea, but it was overused in so many other less-than-dramatic places that it diminished its intensity for the climactic moments.And there are other moments when the movie seems like a stage play. When crowds of people are standing around listening to a pronouncement, do they really start repeating the words of the speaker so obviously amongst themselves? When a proclamation is made that the Hebrew slaves can no longer make stones with straw to build the Egyptian cities, you literally hear about 900 people say "No straw?" I have never actually seen this kind of behavior except in older movies and musicals, like The Music Man.Still, all things considered, The Ten Commandments is one of the great epics of the 1950's, and not to be missed unless you detest visuals of the sky accompanied by large belting orchestral music. Or you're less than enthralled with Biblical epics. I must admit, the scene in which the recently liberated Hebrews start worshipping the Golden Calf made me feel like I was in cinematic slavery...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe The Greatest Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ten Commandments is at the top of my list and at the age of 56 I've seen many movies. Why the top? Because it has everything: first-the LORD, then-drama, history, romance, adventure, suffering, joy, power, weakness, humor, sadness, good, evil, love, hate, triumph, loss, spectacle and finally, a great story which will be told over and over forever. It may be a good idea for as many people as possible to see this movie, particularly those people who don't like Jewish people. If Arabs or Persians or Asians or anyone else were to spend the time and watch this movie they might understand more of the history of the Jews and how they pretty much invented freedom and the law. Yes, they had help from the LORD and right now we could all use some help from above. And we also should learn the history of other religions, religions such as Islam. Maybe then we could learn why so many followers of Islamic teaching are so brutally opposed to Jewish people and the Jewish state. And no I'm not Jewish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this classic film. Ok Heston, he kicks ass and is always great to watch in these old classic films. The scene where he comes down from the mountain all white haired and bearded has to be one of the great cinema scenes of all time. Who else could have played Moses?? I can't picture it. In fact if I ever met Moses I wouldn't doubt for a second that he'd look like Charlie. So let's even start with some of the other minor players.. Edward G. Robinson as Dathan was real good. His coniving nature and fox like attitude was just classic. Vincent Price as Baka the building assistant. I think this is the first movie I've seen him in during his early career where he wasn't in a horror movie. He was fantastic even though he was on for only a short time, what an evil dude. Then you have the major players.. Anne Baxter as Nefretiri. I would have done ANYTHING for this woman!! She lights up the screen and has such a presence. She is seductive, sexy, passionate, yet she is also backstabbing and ruthless. Perfect casting for this role and what a woman!! Is she ever hot!! That woman is MINE god damn she is good!! But then... Then.. the person who steals this movie away is Yul. HE KICKS ASS!! in this film. He is the MAN the DUDE the POWER behind this film! When he's talking he is the STAR! and NO ONE can overcome him. Just that glare he gives can only come from a master of stage and screen. Other stuff... Even the scene where Moses is dying through the dessert and near death, he still manages to kick those guys asses. Those must have been some powerful dates he ate I bought it totaly. Seriously I didn't mind it in the film. Criticisms. Not many I got totaly into it. The last 20 minutes of the film was a little preachy and long but I guess if they didn't have that then they couldn't call it the 'Ten Commandments' now would they? It a universal good story regardless of peoples faith. Rating 9 out of 10</fullReview>

See "Brute Force", "Criss Cross" and "Band of Angels" among others. There was much buzz about her performance in "Band of Angels" with many people urging an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, but it never came to be.I had the good fortune of seeing her on Broadway in Steven Sondheim"s lavish and wonderful musical "Follies". Her movie career was virtually over by then. She won a Tony nomination for Best Featured Actress in a musical. Her memorable rendition of the song "I'm Still Here" has been imitated many, many times since, but never outdone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To consider the epics of our current age (Troy, Alexander) in comparison with earlier epics like 'The Ten Commandments' it is no wonder that many yearn for the films of yesterday. I suppose that directors like Cecil B. DeMille had a much more keen interest in staying true to the classic storyline and exposing it, instead of contemporary filmmakers who are insistent on interjecting political and social relevency into ancient stories. And yet, despite critical panning and box-office disaster, the highly touted directors who have delivered a non-ending supply of filmed revisionist history seem determined to keep it going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The 10 Commandments" is a timeless epic and DeMille's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cecil B. DeMille's greatest film has stood the test of time. The story of Moses continues to engross audiences in its prime-time TV screenings receiving decent ratings each time it is shown. The film has many great attributes. The performance of Anne Baxter as the Egyptian queen, Nefretiri, is often underrated. Her remarkable beauty, indeed, make her a desirable consort for both Moses and Rameses. The portrayal of Moses' wife, Sephora, by Yvonne DeCarlo was her best performance. Her love scene with Moses in the shadow of Mt. Sinai is one of the more poignant quiet moments in the film. Yul Brynner had his most successful year in films in 1956. He was a superb foil for Moses. He also gave his iconic Oscar-winning performance as the ruler of Siam in "The King and I", as well as his fine Pygmalion to Ingrid Bergman's "Anastasia", all in one year. Listen to Elmer Bernstein's galvanizing musical score. His individual themes for the major characters and epic scenes draw the viewer right into the action. Although "Commandments" is best seen on a giant theatre screen, the laserdisc versions are superior visually. The new Dolby Digital soundtrack has its faults, but the use of surround sound during the parting of the Red Sea and the drowning of the Egyptian host is effective. The new animated film version of the story of Moses, Prince of Egypt, owes much to this version of the biblical tale. It also relates at length the apocryphal story of Moses' life in the court of Pharaoh before he came to the realization he was born of Hebrew slaves. "The Ten Commandments" was nominated for Best Picture of 1956, but only won the award for Best Special Effects. "Around the World in 80 Days" won Best Picture that year. Try to sit through that 3 hour epic on television. "The Ten Commandments" will remain in the pantheon of great ancient epics for it tells a timeless story with sweep and emotion that is rarely found in the films of today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good news: it is one of DeMille's greatest epics and has some FX that are still amazing. Bad news: it is full of DeMille's pompous silent-film-days style which induced in the cast almost cartoonish over-acting.Good news: it is the film that made Heston a big star. Bad news: it set him in stone as a stuffed shirt, a pompous actor who would repeat the pattern in films such as BEN HUR, EL CID, and KHARTOUM. He has done little to change this image, especially in light of the fact that he is a high profile right-winger in his politics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without exception, DeMille's 1956 Ten Commandments is truly the greatest film of all time. In fact, to refer to it as "a film" is like referring to the American flag as just a piece of cloth.The Ten Commentments (1956) is a dramatic, beautifully photographed, deeply moving religious experience which, like the Commandments themselves, can speak to all people of any time period.The recent made-for-TV remake (2006) paled by comparison.I don't care how many stand-up comics make fun of Edward G. Robinson in his role as Dathan. As far as I'm concerned, DeMille must have been guided by God Himself in making this film, for DeMille has given all believers a truly inspiration document of faith that will stand forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1956 - the year of Rock Around the Clock, Baby Doll, Gilda, The Girl Can't Help It....and The Ten Commandments.Has it ever been possible to make a convincing, non-comic movie out of a Bible story? Passolini, perhaps, managed it, but I can't instantly think of anyone else. Certainly no Hollywood example springs to mind. They've all been duds. This one is no exception, although the sheer size of it means it fails hugely.While the scale of the endeavour might be commended, and various aspects of the production complimented (the womens' costumes, in particular, contain some excellent designs), the script is abysmal. Actually 'abysmal' doesn't do justice to its awfulness. Dire, dreadful, even unspeakable - but there they all are, those unfortunate performers, speaking it.The actresses come out of this sorry mess with some credit, except for Anne Baxter who is terrible. All the men are terrible except for Edward G Robinson, who rises above the dross to give the only completely credible performance, with Nina Foch, Martha Scott and Yvonne de Carlo in joint second place, the rest of the women sharing third and forth. All the men except Edward G scrabble in the dust, getting nowhere.Any actor, given what Brynner and Heston have to say and do, would find it challenging, to say the least. Perhaps Orson Welles might have gotten away with it, or Olivier, or Brando. But not these guys. Brynner occasionally underplays to momentary effect, but then finds himself forced to register extreme sorrow with a pose that could only have been permitted by a silent film director. Heston is scuppered here, as he was throughout his career, by a complete absence of charm. But then, what charm is possible in a succession of ludicrous wigs? It's very surprising, how little the camera moves. It's this that dates the film more than the process shots - for those you have to make allowances: the effects team did the best it could with the technology available. But the static camera makes the entire thing an illustrated book, or a series of tableaux. This doesn't help the actors, who are left smouldering in shots in a style that we've come to love and mock in TV soap operas. The composition of individual shots, especially with regard to colour contrast, is often impressive, but three hours' worth of film can't be sustained by that.Elmer Bernstein's score is often alluring, though it suffers from the fate of any music in such a movie - too many climaxes. When you've accompanied the parting of the Red Sea, what do you do to when the Ten Commandments are carved into a mountainside by fire? The story of the suffering of the Hebrews in Egypt became, as we all know, a metaphor for many other such oppressions. Verdi turned it into eloquent song, as did the unknown composers of the powerful spirituals which emerged from American cotton and tobacco plantations. The emotion - no - the passion behind those songs and the struggles they represent is rendered completely inert by Cecil B de Mille. His film, whatever his good intentions, is a bloated travesty of everything it aspires to. Ironically, it's worth watching, for that very reason - to see how its windy portentousness continues in the work of the likes of Roland Emmerich, George Lucas and others. But that's not much of a justification for frittering away one's life on Earth. File it under low priority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>11th Commandment: Thou Needeth A Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a remake of the 1923 silent film, and was a big hit. It continues to be a popular film on TV, especially at Easter. However, now that it has been 51 years since this last one, it's about time for another updated version! Come on, Hollywood!Because the story of the plagues and the parting the Red Sea is so crucial to the dramatics of this famous Old Testament story, this film is crying out for updated special-effects. The FX in this 1956 movie are almost laughable, they look so primitive compared what is done today.Filmmakers could really make an awesome-looking story with today's technology but, alas, the ultra-secular mindset of Hollywood in the past 50 years doesn't make it look like it will happen. It will take a wealthy individual, not tied to a Hollywood studio, to finance a remake of this movie.That's not to say this film isn't without merit, even today. Of course it is, and with the likes of Charleton Heston, Yul Brynner, Edward G. Robinson, Anne Baxter and Yvonne DeCarlo , you have a nice cast. Who can deny Heston isn't memorable as "Moses?" I thought Brynner as "Rameses," the pharaoh of Egypt, was just as intense. There also is such a grand scale to this that, even with outdated effects, it can still awe and inspire. Hey, it's a Cecille B. DeMille directed film, so you know it will epic in the true sense of the word.However, at three-and-a-half hours, and Moses not returning to Egypt after almost two hours of mostly-boring (and Scriptually inaccurate) ramblings, this film lags in too many spots. It isn't just the special-effects that need upgrading, it needs a tighter script, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lord, what a bloated turkey!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried watching this film again after 60 years of adulthood, and it really is a laugh riot. The acting? Spotty. The spectacle? Well,they did the best they could. Long patches of stentorian voice-over explaining the story? A feeble crutch for a lousy script. And they can't blame its age, either. Many films made that same year or earlier did a much better job: GWTW, Casablanca, To The Ends of The Earth, the Third Man. But did those films waste as much money? I concur that Chester Moses(Old joke-sorry, I mean Charlton Heston) was at his usual best, but he was a whole lot better in a better film three years later: Ben-Hur. On second viewing, I had a hard time swallowing the inclusion of every Hollywood actor with a pulse being thrown in to play either an Egyptian or a Jew, regardless of the actor's ethnicity or abilities. Heston and Yul Brynner were winners as Moses and Ramses-heck, Yul Brynner was exotic enough to play any race, any age-but there was an awful lot of "Yondah lies da castle of my fadah"on the soundtrack. Ethnic PC just wasn't the issue in Hollywood that it is now, unfortunately. A lot of reviewers here praise the grandiose spectacle of this film; I think Christian viewers probably love it for presenting a concrete realization of the mysteries of the Bible. I think it would have been a better film if the director had lopped off about 2/3 of the dialog and let the actors put the story across. I mean, could a Hebrew-speaking underclass really be expected to converse at length with Egyptian aristocrats? Very little about this film makes much sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen it listed in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I heard some things about the making of the film, and I knew how long it was, so it was just a case of trying it, from director Cecil B. DeMille (The Greatest Show on Earth). Basically it is all about the life of Moses, starting from when he was a baby sent down the river Nile when the Pharoah Rameses declared all first-born Hebrew boys would be killed. He was found by the Pharoah's sister Bithiah (Nina Foch) who raises him to adulthood as the Prince of Egypt. Moses (Golden Globe nominated Charlton Heston) is all grown up and has completely fit into the royal family that rule over Egypt, with the favour of Sethi (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) and a love with Princess Nefretiri (Anne Baxter). Then he discovers his true heritage as a Hebrew, and Sethi's son Rameses (Yul Brynner) wastes no time making sure that he is cast out of the kingdom and anything baring his name removed. After finding civilisation after being stranded in the desert, Moses finds a village, marries and has a son, but the most important event comes when he travels into the strange mountains when he sees a burning bush. This bush speaks, it is the voice of God (Heston's voice), and he commands Moses to free all the Hebrew slaves of Egypt from the wrath of Rameses. Moses returns with a white beard, and he does go to Rameses warning him of the consequences if he does not free the slaves, but the nasty Pharoah does not give into the demands of God. Even with a staff turning into a snake, rivers running with blood, hot hail and three days of darkness, Rameses still does not free the slaves, he even orders all first-born Hebrews are killed, but this backfires. So Moses sends a green cloud that will kill all the firstborns of Egypt, including Rameses's so, and his grief finally convinces him to free all the slaves and follow Moses to the holy place. Rameses does try to catch Moses and all the slaves as they travel, but Moses performs his biggest miracle by parting the sea for all the slaves to walk across the ocean floor, and drown all the soldiers behind them. The final scene of the film sees Moses return from the mysterious mountain, after seeing God fire lightning bolts into the stone wall, carving the ten commandments that everyone will follow. Unfortunately, Moses returns to see everyone committing most of the sins that go against the commandments, and he knows they will forever live in sin, and smashes the two commandment tablet stones, saying a final goodbye to head to Israel. Also starring Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora, Debra Paget as Lilia, John Derek as Joshua, John Carradine as Aaron and Vincent Price as Baka. Heston is a great majestic choice to play Moses, he does well without the beard, but with is much more significant, Bryner is terrific as the vile villain, and the supporting cast add to the piece too. The special effects aren't to dated to be enjoyed, the film may be nearly four hours long and contain some near too-far material concerning religion, but as a remake to DeMille's own 1923 classic, this is a magnificent biblical epic. It won the Oscar for Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture. Moses was number 43 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 79 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 21 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who had the idea to cast action-hero-bland Heston pitted against the charismatic Yul Brynner? I feel so sorry for Anne Baxter who had to play Nefretiri and throw herself to Heston. Everyone else was wonderful at their roles, Anne was vampy and held her own and of course, Brynner was marvelous. Heston just ruined the movie for me, his bland acting, his pompous air, everything. I kept thinking, even as a child, 'Why does everyone love this guy?'. His nature was callous and he reminded me of a spoil brat... EVEN when he spoke to God. My 'favorite scene' was the lack of humility standing before the Burning Bush. Brynner's burning envy, his arrogance, and his humiliation towards Moses and the pain of losing his son is remarkable. If they only had a lead that was worthy to play against being rival of Brynner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story of Moses is so bloated that one would think it could float down the street in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Its camp in ways that would make the 1960'2 Batman jealous and so over the top in reverence as to be laughable. And despite all of that its a great deal of fun to simply curl up with and watch. There are many ways to watch this, from the just taking it on its wooden face, or watching it for the entirely bizarre casting which makes you wonder what was Cecil B De Mille thinking or perhaps one could watch trying to find all of the subtexts - both real and imagined.They don't make them like this any more and once you've witnessed the spectacle of ancient Egypt you'll know why, productions like this are simply too huge to work with out falling into parody.

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was nine years old. It did go on. I remember being amazed by the special effects. More impressive than the parting of the Red Sea were some of the plagues. That burning bush was pretty hokey, but, hey, it was the fifties. It doesn't wear so well these days. There are a lot of rough edges everywhere. But it was a masterpiece of its time. What I find the hardest these days s the pacing. It seems to go on forever. There are long pompous speeches, lots of overacting, and some plot elements that are thrown in for,what were then modern audiences. Edward G. Robinson seems to have a lot of clout. If someone had just parted the sea and performed a whole series of miracles, would you immediately betray him and follow a guy who has done nothing but talk. But then the masses may be asses. What have you done for me lately. Had this film been made today, it could be put into the hands of a top film editor and made much tighter and more intense. I thought Yul Brynner's presence was really good. He's the best thing in the movie. I really tire of the female characters and his wife is, in my estimation, pretty insufferable. Charlton Heston was pretty good as a young actor, long before he became a caricature. The biggest sin for this film is that they talk the life right out of it. I'm glad when they get where they're going so they don't have to discuss it anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, like many others, love this film. It is one of the greatest ever made, and most of those who condemn it do so either because they consider DeMille to have been talentless or because the film does not stick close enough to the Bible. The latter are generally ignorant of the research done for the film by Henry S. Noerdlinger (see his very informative book, "Moses &amp; Egypt: The Documentation to the Motion Picture...")Director's style: DeMille's family bible &amp; those found in many 19th-cent. homes were graced by the engravings of Gustave Dore, a French artist of the mid-1800's. His style, like that of the 17th-cent. French painter Poussin, was highly theatrical, with figures being depicted in admittedly unnatural poses, looking as if they were sculpted figures lifted from the frieze of the Parthenon. These artists were depicting larger-than-life events (like the Exodus) &amp; did not wish to show them as mundane, everyday occurrences. DeMille's critics should look at these artists' attention to colour, composition, and exquisite detail, &amp; then compare them to the works of later, more famous artists and try to maintain that the earlier works are inferior. Indeed, they display a level of talent which the later ones either did not possess or chose not to display. It is thus unfair to condemn DeMille's style, as every director has his own, either flamboyant or low-key.I won't address the question of whether or not Moses existed, but will say that the "Biblical Minimalists" who reject almost everything in the early part of the Torah have a very prejudiced agenda. Eager to destroy the hold that Judaism/Christianity have on people, they do their best to invalidate these religions' foundations. Appealing to questionable anachronisms in the Bible, they try to show that these cast doubt on the whole narrative, even though impartial, creditable scholars have found ample (though often circumstantial evidence) to support the existence of Abraham, Moses, etc. The question of who the Pharaoh of the Exodus was is tied to chronological considerations beyond the scope of this review, but many conservative scholars still put forth Rameses II as the best candidate. Story: An intoxicating mix of the Bible &amp; somewhat streamlined Egyptian history. The love affair between Moses &amp; Nefretiri as well as the characters of Memnet &amp; Baka were taken from "Prince of Egypt," a novel by Dorothy Clarke Wilson. Some liberties with the Bible are taken: one of them was a virtual necessity. In Ex. 32, when Moses finds his people worshipping the golden calf, he orders his fellow-Levites to slay 3000 of them. A mod. audience could not accept such brutality unless it came from God.. Thus the writers combined 2 incidents: the calf episode &amp; the destruction of Dathan &amp; Abiram, who were indeed swallowed up by the earth in a separate rebellion (Numbers 16). The writers incorporated traditions from the Midrash on Exodus into the film with consummate skill. The prominent role assigned to Dathan comes from such sources, as does the participation of Bithiah in the Exodus. Performances: Heston &amp; Brynner are superb. Their acting is, at times, rather histrionic, but it should be remembered that in an epic less than grandiose-style acting is not in keeping with the subject matter. Yes, Anne Baxter hammed it up (but less than Jethro's daughters, who gush like lovesick teenagers over Moses), but such minor complaints are eclipsed by the overall lustre of the film, which does not have a single boring minute. Some have said that Edward G. Robinson seems too much like the gangster characters he played in other films. I had never seen these films prior to watching "The 10 Commandments"; so this criticism only applies if one is accustomed to seeing him in such roles.Costumes: EXCELLENT. Even Moses' red robe with black &amp; white stripes is based on a Jewish trad. which ascribes these colours to the Levite tribe, to which Moses belongs. The Egyptians (except for the priests) did NOT only wear white &amp; were able to produce very diaphanous materials, though not as gorgeous as those seen on screen, but all the jewellery is authentic. Also, the dress of Egyptian queens did not emphasize the breasts, but DeMille was shrewd enough to realize that Anne Baxter's cleavage would attract male audiences. Sets &amp; Props: VERY accurate: reliefs on treasure city's pylons were inspired by actual 19th Dynasty designs...throne seen in opening where Rameses I condemns all Hebrew male newborns to death is an EXACT replica of one found in Tutankhamun's tomb. Lettering on tablets is authentic Canaanite/Paleo-Hebrew.Special FX: Still look fantastic, though matte lines can be detected; their surreal look is effective. Use of effects animation to create pillar of fire better than real fire, as the Bib. fire was an unearthly one. An interesting &amp; racially progressive element in the film is found in scene where Moses presents Ethiopian king &amp; sister to Sethi. In 1956 racist America, it would have been unthinkable to show Moses involved with a black woman. But DeMille managed to suggest something here which would elude viewers unfamiliar with Josephus. In this source, Moses, as general of the Eg. army, cannot capture Saba, the Ethiopian capital, until Princess Tharbis (her name appears in the credits but is not spoken on screen) tells Moses that she will deliver the city to him if he weds her, to which he agrees. In the film, Tharbis (Esther Brown), with a provocative expression, hands a necklace to Moses, saying that he is "wise." Sethi: "It is pleasing to the gods to see a man so honoured by his enemies." "And such a beautiful enemy!" Nefretiri comments. Why is Moses wise? Because he married Tharbis to conquer Saba! And Nefretiri sees her as a rival! In a prejudiced era, DeMille was very daring. So much for accusations of his lacking subtlety! He was really quite progressive!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cecil B. DeMille's "Passion".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always remembered most for the landmark scene where the Red Sea is parted (which made it an easy Visual Effects Oscar winner in 1956), "The Ten Commandments" ultimately does not completely succeed in conveying Old Testament teachings of the Holy Bible to its audience. This is the story of Moses (Charlton Heston), a reluctant hero who led the enslaved Israelites out of Egyptian slavery. The character gave up a life of Egyptian wealth and status when he learned what his true background was. Eventually Heston is contacted by God in the form of the Burning Bush and he learns what the Lord's will for him truly is. Yul Brynner dominates as King Ramses, the evil Egyptian who would not let Christ's people go. Wonderful turns by Anne Baxter, Yvonne DeCarlo and the scene-stealing Edward G. Robinson do give the production an element of class and grace. However, director Cecil B. DeMille (doing his final production here) does give up the well-being of his characters for spectacle (something that is not near as important as the Bible's tale). In the end this turned out to be a major mistake and the film's astronomical running time (going about 220 minutes) makes the movie very hard to sit through. Overall this is the best biblical adaptation ("Ben-Hur" is a better film, but it has nothing to do with biblical teaching) the cinema has ever experienced, but really Hollywood and the Holy Bible do not mix well. So watch "The Ten Commandments" when you have a lot of time on your hands, but to get the real truth turn to the good book instead. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Grand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, this movie seems to be highly over-rated by practically everyone who sees it! I just watched it tonight for the first time and I was quite disappointed. The DVD cover described it as one of the greatest films of all time, so I sat down with this thought in mind. Because of the period in history it represented and the main actor involved I was expecting something on the grand scale of Ben Hur - which I do regard as one of the best films of all time - but instead I found this film to be substandard in several areas. Firstly the acting is melodramatic, and while it appears to be a purposeful style that Cecil has applied, it unfortunately comes off looking too comical to be taken seriously. Anne Baxter was unable to get into the role correctly at all, and she looks and sounds more like she's playing the part of some smug gangster's broad in a 1950's flick starring Humphrey Bogart. The next most irritating aspect was the constant use of a superimposed back drop in scenes clearly performed on stage. Sorry, but I've been spoiled by the wonderful production of Ben Hur, where the only obvious scene using superimposition or models was during the sea battle. Every other part of Ben Hur was done on enormous outdoor sets that were simply breathtaking to behold, where as with the 10 Commandments I found myself constantly listening to studio echo during conversations taking place in a desert setting, or backdrops of massive stone structures that looked too perfect and smooth to be anything other than small scale models. The river scenes suffered from the enclosed feel of a studio in both sound and appearance; Moses stumbling upon a sheep-herding group of beautiful young women was ridiculous (not one of these women was even remotely plain); and the music was totally unsuitable for the period or the importance of the story. I could mention a hundred other things but I'm beginning to feel bad about the negativity of my review. There were things that I did like however. The parting of the ocean was particularly well done, and Moses spewed out classic one liners for the first half of the film like I've never heard anyone do in a movie before. 6 stars, just slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 Commandments - what no one can ever keep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm watching on TV, the old "10 commandments" -- haven't seen it since I was very young. I'm most attracted to this movie for Charlton Heston, because he is so HOT. Yul Brynner that bald man? No way.. Chuckie is the hot one! This is the most overacted, dramatic, historically and religiously incorrect and massively flawed piece o' garbage I've ever witnessed. I'm laughing a lot.. it plays out like an elementary school play..I cannot believe the logic that the first born sons of Egypt would die and that this is "Gods desire".I suppose if people believed that this is the "desire" of a God, they would never question it, but its actually so unrealistic and cruel.I would love to tell you how it ends, but it came out in the 50's. lolBut hot damn that CHARLTON! WOOHOO.. sizzle!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched with increasing disbelief as the narrative invented entire portions of the life of Moses, whilst distorting the Biblical story almost beyond recognition.Why waste more than 30 minutes on invented back-story when the time would have been better spent on the Plagues, or the revelation at Mt. Sinai? Cecil B. de Mille probably didn't read the original before making this film, and it shows. Nice performances by Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston at times, and the best parts are certainly the plagues: the darkness and the Death of the Firstborn being the most effective. In truth, Pharoah's own magicians would have made better FX than Hollywood, since Egypt was to magic and sorcery what Broadway is to Musicals. Talking of which, I think that what I have seen of Dreamworks' "Prince of Egypt" did the Biblical epic more justice. So let it be written, so let it be done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absurd Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One would think ancient Egypt was built of ham given the unusual amount of overacting lurking around. Charlton Heston is Moses, Yul Brynner postures a lot as Ramses, and Anne Baxter is the heavily made-up Nefreteri. They're all terrible. Heston makes Brynner look like Brando and Baxter pouts and does a lot of heavy breathing whenever Heston is around. Also in the mix are Judith Anderson, John Carridine, Vincent Price, Edward G. Robinson, Cedric Hardwicke and Yvonne DeCarlo. An absurd masterpiece by one of the most ridiculous directors of all time. Cecil B. DeMille clearly thinks of himself as GOD..or at least God's proxy...he narrates this claptrap. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ranks up there with VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, MOMMIE DEAREST and BEYOND THE FOREST as one of the all time camp classics. There's hardly a line of dialog that isn't some sort of twisted metaphor or didactic lecture. It should be enjoyed on that level and nothing more..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thou shalt not consider this movie worthy of a 2nd viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sure that I was suitably impressed when I first saw "The Ten Commandments" on TV almost 30 years ago. There is no denying that this is a movie of epic size and scope. However, times change and I am no longer the impressionable wunderkind that I was back in 1975. The result is that my middle aged self had a great deal of trouble even making it through THE FIRST HOUR OF FOUR on last Saturday night's showing on ABC. It was rough going from beginning to end and the only thing that kept me awake and alert was my wife's grim insistence and the involuntary giggles that the inanities of the production registered on my weary brain. "The Ten Commandments" (1956) was Cecil B. DeMille's swan song remake of his silent movie of the same name made in 1923. The only difference being that the 1923 movie has a parallel plot worked into it relating to the present day. The 1956 version is all Old Testament---all the way.I don't have the advantage of having seen this movie on the big screen -- but it's safe to say that the picture has a scale against which all other Hollywood epics are judged. For that reason alone this film is worth viewing once. I would not, however, recommend buying the DVD and running "The Ten Commandments" each and every Easter. The straight-jacketed plot and character development become more and more pronounced on each repeat viewing. What's that you say? How dare I offer up plot criticism on the Bible ? What I am referring to here is the license that is granted to anyone making a theatrical representation of a story from the Bible. There is plenty of room for interpretation and translation of the age old biblical themes for modern audiences--- without removing the aura of mystery -the unknowable accepted only by faith. DeMille had an obligation to develop the story and character elements in such a way as to make the plot and people seem understandable (if not totally revelatory) to the modern viewer. In this he failed and I am afraid that this film's absurdities pile up rather fast. Charlton Heston does have the charisma to play Moses. He looks and sounds the part. But he delivers many of his lines with a 500 yard stare and substitutes human emotions for a type of constipated self awareness. Heston's Moses goes through many life changing events during the movie--not the least of which are a couple of one on one pow-wows with the Almighty--however he seems very much the same person from beginning to end.Anne Baxter as Nefertiri possesses a sharp-edged urbanity that does not translate well into a princess of ancient Egypt. Perhaps the kindest thing that can be said of her performance is that she was seriously miscast. I kept expecting her to light up a cigarette or pull a lipstick out of a hidden purse. John Derek does O.K. in the role of Joshua. While it's true that he is every bit as bad an actor as Heston--he at least shows some energy and animation in his role.Yvonne De Carlo hits the marks as Moses' ultra-sturdy wife Sephora. It's remarkable to consider that she would go from this part to playing Lilly Munster on TV less than 8 years later----well...maybe not so remarkable.Cedric Hardwicke (Pharaoh Sethi), Vincent Price (Baka) and John Carradine (Aaron) do journeyman duty---but the acting prizes here go to Yul Brynner as Rameses and Edward G. Robinson as the Hebrew front man Dathan.Brynner exhibits the intensity, pride and overt arrogance that one would expect from an Egyptian prince / Pharaoh. And, if you can get around his trademark gangster-like patter, Edward G. Robinson does well as Dathan - a man forever trying to sell out and exploit his own people. But it is in the way that these two fine acting performances are misused that we find the most pronounced flaws in this film.Of course, Rameses and Dathan are shown to be bad guys. Grant them their evilness and ruthlessness--however DeMille does not prepare us for the suicidal stupidity that he has them exhibit in the second half of the movie... Quite the opposite --they are built up in the first part of the movie as being cagey and very astute manipulators---then we are asked to watch them act like star idiots for the balance of the picture. Shrewd Rameses as portrayed by Brynner should not have called Moses' bluff on the angel of death business and he certainly would not have ordered his army down into the parted Red Sea to attack the fleeing Hebrews. And the ever conniving but eminently practical Dathan would not have tried to undercut Moses?of all people---on the shore of the Red Sea with Pharaoh's army approaching---certainly not after witnessing the plagues that Moses was able to call down on Egypt. When a pillar of fire comes down from the sky to block the army's advance (A pillar of fire!)?. Edward G. Robinson is forced to deliver one of the most ridiculous lines in the history of cinema as he tries to convince the fleeing Hebrews that their position is hopeless: "How long do ya a think that fire's gonna hold them ?".Again, remember ? I am not offering a criticism of the Bible story of Moses itself ?but rather pointing out how badly DeMille failed to produce a coherent rendering of it in this film. In "The Ten Commandments" DeMille succeeded only in fashioning an often insipid if mammoth production ?so honeycombed with senselessness so as to make even an Alabama Supreme Court Justice cough and scratch himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every Easter Biblical movies are shown on television but "The Ten Commandments" ?at least around these shores- had been absent for many years. Its reappearance is more than welcome, for it is one of the most sincere camp megaproductions ever made, in screaming Technicolor and with a wonderful cast. I had two memories of this movie: the first -when I was a little boy and taken to the cinema by the priests of the school where I was educated- had a strong impression on me, as a huge spectacle; but the second, as a 1970's disco entity probably not in my senses, caused me the opposite impression, as I found it corny and extremely long. Now as a mature being, I find quite interesting that it is a mixture of both impressions: it is huge, it is corny and it is too long: it spends too much time with Anne Baxter bitching and Yul Brynner posing, and it ends abruptly. There is no way one can defend it as a great achievement in the history of cinema, but I believe that Cecil B. DeMille was sincerely convinced that he was making a masterful movie, and his sincerity shows. That, in the end, is a saving grace in the midst of all the kitsch surrounding him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I found it awesome as a child, mildly interesting as a teener and absolutely nauseating as an adult.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw it as a 1st grade elementary schooler, I was thrilled. As it is regularly re-runned during Holy Week in my country (Philippines) I saw it again as a teener and was mildly entertained. As an adult its flaws became all too apparent - the horrendously executed background scenery and the stagey (over)acting by most of the actors. I guess De Mille was too bothered by arthritis to shoot outdoors all the time or on location. But at the very least he should have hired Walt Disney Studios to animate the background scenery. Imagine a Middle East panoramic view behind Moses and his wife and the clouds in the sky are not even moving. Besides, the colors are way off.De Mille played fast and loose with biblical history as he put Josuah on the scene at the beginning of the Exodus. He wasn't even born at that time because remember, the Lord did not want any of the fallen generation to enter the Promised Land. He was a man in his prime when he assumed generalship of the Israelites when they entered Canaan and exterminated native peoples there allegedly at the Lord's command. My own view is that since Exodus was written during the exile when they lived as slaves and hostages in Babylon, the all too human sacred writers sought to instill national pride by embellishments portraying the Israelites as ruthless conquerors in an age when ferocity in battle was much admired. In other words, it was all a PR thing. The film does gross injustice to the Egyptians portraying them as unjust and cruel. The Bible itself disproves this as Egypt has been the traditional refuge for the Israelites in times of hardship as evident in the story of Joseph of the coat of many colors who rose to become grand vizier to the Pharoah. Remember too that the Holy Family fled to Egypt to protect Jesus, the promised Messiah from Herod the Great. And Egypt enjoys favorable mention in God's words: "From out of Egypt, I have called out my son." Christians would also do well to ponder on the fact that their religion did not come fully defined into the West whose peoples propagated it worldwide. Much of Christian doctrine was formulated by the early Church Fathers in the Eastern Church where Alexandria (in Egypt) enjoyed prominent place. It was the Council of Nicea that finally clarified for all Christians that Jesus was not only the Son of God but was Himself God. From this proceeded the conclusion that the Blessed Virgin Mary was Theotokos or God-bearer and thus worthy of hyper-veneration among the saints, first practiced by the faithful in Egypt, a surviving remnant we now know as the Copts.A cursory reading of the Egyptians' Book of the Dead and a little common sense would also reveal that much of the Ten Commandments was culled from it. The Egyptians probably adapted much of the Mesopotamians'Code of Hammurabi into their system of morality. Nevertheless, for all we know, nobody copied these notions of morality from anybody. In the computer language easily understood by young people today, it may be that morality is hard wired or programmed into our brains. But in biblical language, we say that God has written His law into our hearts. De Mille also peddled the popular but unproven notion that the Pharoah in Exodus was one of the Ramses kings of Egypt (Ramses II is the more likely candidate as he was the most accomplished in terms of conquests but there is a problem about contemporaneous timelines). As a result, the movie defames not only Ramses II but even his wife, Queen Nefertari about whom history tells us almost nothing except that she was queen. Portraying her as woman scorned, the ex-girlfriend of Moses is really stooping to the pits.In any case, it should be mentioned that the seeds of monotheism was already in Egypt several hundred years before Moses. Pharoah Akenathon believed in one supreme deity whom he identified as Aten, the sun disc. It was not, however, entirely a monotheistic religion as it did not preclude the existence of other gods, only that Aten was supreme. In the same manner, semitic peoples in the Middle East were also not, strictly speaking, monotheistic at the time. Among the Hebrews, YHWH, a tribal God slowly gained ascendancy over the other tribal gods and the "gods of the high places" (cf. The Source by James Michener) until worship became exclusive to Him. Allah too was the chief god among the many gods housed in the Kaaba of the Bedouin Arabs in ancient times until Mohammed preached him as the supreme and only deity. In any case, pure polytheism has never been the rule among peoples but rather, henotheism as even among the Greeks and Romans, whom early Christian writers derided as "pagans," had a hierarchy of gods with Zeus/Jupiter viewed as the highest among the Graeco-Romans. But then philosophers such as Aristotle saw the gods as merely agents or representations of a higher ineffable Power. In Hindu philosophy/religion they would be called "avatars."Burt Lancaster, in Moses the Lawgiver, did better. And, to think it was just a movie for TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumbering but at least visually beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The narrative of this solemn, visually majestic biblical epic is so rambling that the REAL story (I mean, the "interesting stuff", after Moses discovers his mission and returns to Egypt) begins after about 2 hours and 10 minutes; most movies would be over by then, but De Mille has only managed to spin out the prologue. Considering that, along with the often hokey dialogue (near the end, during the "orgiastic" scene, the narrator tells us:"And there was sin, and anomie, and uncleanness, and violence, and rioting, and....etc"), the movie is often hard to sit through, but it does have its rewards: astonishing cinematography, solid acting by most of the cast and special effects that hold up very well after almost 45 years.

		<shortDescription>Scriptural inaccuracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to comment on the scriptural inaccuracy in this movie. Not whether it's a good movie or not, you can still appreciate the movie. But don't think you learn anything about Shemot (Exodus) when watching it.Look at this for example, this is what Shemot says:Shemot 2:10-15 "10. The child grew up, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became like her son. She named him Moses, and she said, "For I drew him from the water." 11. Now it came to pass in those days that Moses grew up and went out to his brothers and looked at their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man of his brothers. 12. He turned this way and that way, and he saw that there was no man; so he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 13. He went out on the second day, and behold, two Hebrew men were quarreling, and he said to the wicked one, "Why are you going to strike your friend?" 14. And he retorted, "Who made you a man, a prince, and a judge over us? Do you plan to slay me as you have slain the Egyptian?" Moses became frightened and said, "Indeed, the matter has become known!" 15. Pharaoh heard of this incident, and he sought to slay Moses; so Moses fled from before Pharaoh. He stayed in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well."This is what Cecil B. DeMille has stretched to almost 2 hours (first half of the movie). So I would say that this movie is more of a remake of Shemot, than based on Shemot.</fullReview>

It takes forever for the plot to get anywhere, and the Moses/Nefretiri romance wouldn't be out of place in a afternoon soap opera. Charles Heston must curse this movie with every other breath, so badly did it typecast him for years to come. The F/X are impressive, and a lot of money was also spent on cast and locations. With its annual Easter showings on network TV, it's perhaps the most memorable of the old-style "epics," but it just doesn't stand up to scrutiny.</fullReview>

This film is as historically based on the life of Moses as "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" was about Abraham Lincoln.

		<shortDescription>New DVD edition is a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying - I really love this movie - one of the greatest examples of old-style Hollywood film making that there is - and this review pertains ONLY to the new 50th Anniversary DVD.Like many admirers of DeMille, I was delighted when this 50th Anniversary Edition appeared but then, profoundly disappointed with what it contains. This movie has had two previous DVD releases and to my eyes, the presentation here is not an improvement on earlier outings. Unlike Warners magnificent restoration of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, GONE WITH THE WIND and WIZARD OF OZ (among others) which were digitally restored, frame by frame, Paramount has merely assembled the best archive print it can and remixed the soundtrack. As for the "extras", surely a film which was in production &amp; pre-production for almost 5 years &amp; cost $13 million to make , had a ton of archive materials - photos, stills, memos, storyboards etc- that could have been included? Check out Disney's SNOW WHITE, or the Special Edition of CITIZEN KANE or the recent, marvellous KING KONG (1933 version) to see how it could have been done! Paramount are cheapskates by comparison.As for the much vaunted 6 part documentary - this seemed very under-produced and cheaply done. Where was Debra Paget? Where was Nina Foch? Where was Yvonne De Carlo? All major players in the film and still very much alive! What great memories they would have had to share! Instead, we get an old, not very interesting interview with Heston (rehashing his oft-told anecdotes) and two minor bit-part players (one, Eugene Mazzola who played Ramses son, offers little as he was only 12 at the time!). And what about Clint Walker? Every time he makes an appearance as a guard (which is often), we are told this by the irritating commentator, as though it was some momentous event - well, if so, why didn't they interview him? He's a nice guy &amp; loves talking about his career. So, Paramount, I am giving the DVD set just 3 stars but only because it is good to finally have the rarely seen silent version available at last. But given the fact that De Mille's own private archive is extensive and comprehensive I am surprised that the De Mille Estate was not more fully involved in this. Of course the movie itself is still astonishing. REAL extras - no computer generated hordes. Full scale sets, costumes to die for, outrageous over the top acting, a full blown score in the Korngold manner, luscious photography with De Mille's remarkable eye for filling the screen with memorable images. How terrific it would be to see the film full restored digitally before its original negatives deteriorate. Will this happen? I doubt it.Three DVDs of one movie in a matter of 8 years seems to me to be milking the cow without any effort and I ask you, how many times will fans buy a DVD of this title? I am wondering - will there be a Super Collectors' Edition next year? If so, I hope it's an improvement on this!A great opportunity missed! Do others agree?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie could turn Jews and Christians into Atheists!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, some background stuff. My wife's family watches this film RELIGIOUSLY every Easter/Passover season. Without fail, when the movie comes on, so does their TV set. One time, they were visiting during these holidays and I said "Why do you want to watch the movie--it's so dull and over-the-top?!". My mother-in-law didn't appreciate my views one bit, but to everyone else in the family it was liberating. They, too, it seemed had grown to hate the movie and just never said anything because they didn't want to be seen as EVIL! So, why is this movie so BAD? It's not the wonderful and spectacular scenes (though a few DON'T age well, most are still impressive). It's the dialog and 1-dimensionality of the characters. Serious lines are delivered so poorly that they are, at times, humorous. Edward G. Robinson's imitation of an Egyptian Gangster when often repeats the same silly line ("he's taken us into the desert--to die like dogs!!!") is a good example. Another is Anne Baxter imploring Moses with "Mo-ses, MOOOOSSSEESS", as she sounds more like a deranged ghost than a woman in love! The fact is, De Mille could very competently direct ACTION but was a hack when it came to dialog and characterization. One of the most overrated films in American movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie massacred the story. The story is cut up to suit what was then perceived as "the way it should have been" - ridiculous. How can you dare think that you can tell a better story other than the Almighty Lord God!?!? You can't. DeMille turned the Word of God into a soap-opera, and a sappy one at that.Here's how bad DeMille spun the Word: Edward G. Robinson plays an evil guy who tempts everybody into worshiping the golden calf while Moses' brother Aaron stands by in shock and shame at the people's depravity *immediately* after God just freed them from Egypt. In the real account it is Aaron who tells the newly freed Israelites to worship the golden calf!Mr. Robinson was probably caste as the evil-doer because of something Hollowood calls "star power." They did this to the Star Wars Pre-quil (it's worth a good sleep) with Samuel L. Jackson. Every time I saw him I thought "where's Travolta, and why isn't he bustin' a cap?" So if a movie reminds you of a totally unrelated movie *WHILE* you are watching it, then you know the value of "star power"!OK Hollywood, here's the "star power" formula:interest = 1 / "star power"^100For you non-scientifically oriented the above formula means that if they ever put a "star" in a role to give the movie a "boost", then you know the movie is not worth seeing, renting, or even watching when it comes out on the broadcast channels.As far as the acting, production, casting, writing (*sigh* there was writing? the writing credits should have been this: Writing: God), and sundry other things that make a *Hollowood* movie, it all was excellent. So if you're not interested in the Truth, or even the truth (non-believers may also want to see an accurate account of the real story according the the way God wrote the book), then you'll love this movie. It's Hollywood at it's best - which means distorting anything they touch.I'll say this that before I became a believer in Christ I thought that this was one of the all time best movies ever made by an American Master... but since I became a believer in Christ I am very disappointed in the movie. So if you see it as good "pulp fiction," then it is that, and that's all. I tried to re-watch it because it is a good movie, but when I saw the Truth twisted so much I couldn't stomach it.-LDPS: Read the Bible, esp. Psalm 22 :)</fullReview>
