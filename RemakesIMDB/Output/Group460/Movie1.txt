		<fullReview>Director: Cecil B. Demille, Script: Jeaine Macpherson, Cast: Theodore Roberts (Moses), Charles de Rochfort (Rameses), Estelle Taylor (Miriam,sister of Moses), Julia Faye (wife of pharaoh), James Neill (Aaron), Edythe Chapman (Mrs. Martha Mc Tavish), Richard Dix (John,son), Rod La Rosque (Dan,son), Nita Naldi (Sally Lung,Eurasian)Most people today have probably never seen this film. It is now available on the 50th anniversary set with the 1956 version. The 1956 version was an amazing movie but in many ways I prefer this one, Cecil B Demille's 1923 original. Many people will be surprised upon first viewing of this film. Demille uses a different approach thin in his 1956 remake. This film has two parts. The first part is set during the time of the exodus in the old testament. The Hebrew nation is enslaved by the Egyptians under the ruthless rule of the pharaoh Rameses. Moses as the chosen leader of the Jews frees his people from the Egyptians. God gives him the power to inflict plagues upon the Egyptians. He then leads his people on the great exodus across the desert to the Red Sea. God gives him the power to part the sea so the Jewish people can cross. Phaorah orders his army to go after the Jews across the parted Red Sea but God had the sea 'return to normal' so the army drowns.Make no mistake, this film was a major production in its day and very high budget for its time. Demille uses very elaborate sets for this production. The exterior wall of the great Egyptian city is just like the one used in the 1956 version. Many extras were used in the making of this film. During the great exodus, there appears to be people for as far as the eye can see. You can see this great line of people spread out across the desert. Camels were seen during the exodus but as it turns out, camels were not in the middle east during that time period. The parting of the Red Sea in the 1956 version was considered an amazing special effect for its time. I was very curious as to how they would be able to pull this off in 1923! I was quite amazed!! The special effects used for the parting of the sea is just as good as the 56 perhaps better. One thing I really like about the special effects of this film is the wall of fire that Moses creates to keep the Egyptian army at bay. In the 56 version animation was used for the fire. In this version real fire was used using a double exposure technique that I thought was more impressive. Mr Demille was very loyal to his actors. He would use many of the same actors in a number of his films. The women who plays the part of pharaoh's wife and the boy that played his son are both involved in the 56 version as well as the film editor.The film switches gears totally for the second half. We are now in modern times. It starts with a mother reading passages from the book of Exodus to her two sons. All the drama from the first half was simply her reading being acted out. The rest of the film is a morality tale between two sons. The mother and one son are deeply religious while the other son is a nonbeliever. He makes fun of his brother's silly beliefs so the mother kicks him out of the house for being a heathen. The believing son lives a modest life while the unbelieving son becomes very wealthy. He even gets the women they both like! He becomes a wealthy contractor employing his brother as a worker. However, the unbelieving brother's life will be filed with misfortune eventually leading to his death. The twist in the second half of the film makes for a interesting viewing experience. I like the contrast between ancient and modern times. Katherine Orrison in her commentary states that the modern sequence will probably seem more dated to the average viewer. I tend to agree. It is interesting to see how people lived and dressed during those times. The modern sequence is filmed mostly on location in San Francisco. It is cool to see how San Fran looked back then. The generation gap between the mother and her sons is very evident. This was the roaring 20's! Katherine Orrison gives an insightful commentary on both films but see seems to have a special fondness for this one. I can understand why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Commentary &amp; Pristine Print Highlight 1923 Version!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The exciting feature of the 50th Anniversary Editon of DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is to be able to see the original 1923 version in a pristine print along with Katherine Orrison's illuminating commentary track. Previously only available on VHS tape with the poorly surviving colorized footage of the Exodus and Parting of the Red Sea (provided as a separate Extra on the DVD)used, it was difficult to realize just how beautifully done the silent epic was. Paramount has cleaned up the print and used only the better surviving black &amp; white elements for this release. The beauty of the photography comes through with great clarity. Orrison's commentary is full of interesting insights as well as being enjoyable due to her enthusiasm about so many details. And Gaylord Carter's Wurlitzer Pipe Organ score is very impressive (as well as being a marvelous record of an organ score done by one who actually performed during the silent era)on this digital stereo recording. The 1956 remake looks and sounds great, as are the all of the special features for it, but this is exactly the same as the previous second edition of this title. I bought the new edition in order to see what they had done with the 1923 version -- and I certainly am impressed. Also, I love the packaging for this edition. Well worth updating as it is available at a very decent price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thou shalt not give a stupid review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oops, broke that one. All joking aside, this film is incredible. Astonishing effects for the early 20s, where you couldn't twist any digital domain to your whims. The parting of the Red Sea is pretty convincing, even if was Jello. (Can you imagine wading through Jello? Ick.) This film is told in two parts, as we get to see Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from God in what looks like a Fourth of July celebration. One with good fireworks. Most people know that story--Moses goes to deliver the Commandments, only to find everyone involved in a massive orgy. Here de Mille is in his element. He did so many massive orgies that he should have copyrighted them. We see people making out (not having sex--that would be wrong), men licking wine off women's feet (that is wrong, by gum), and a huge number of people trying to climb up what looks like a curtain. Why they're doing this only de Mille knows. All we need is Gloria Swanson being pawed by a tiger to make everything perfect. As some viewers may not know, de Mille can show whatever sin and debauchery he wants, because the sinners are going to get it in the end. They're gonna get it bad. From the giddy Israelites and their golden calf we're transported to the modern day (1923), where a woman reads the Bible. She can't be the sinner. A son stands nearby, looking very noble and content. Can't be him. Then, we see the other son. He looks bored and disbelieving. We have a sinner! Oh, and he's a bad one. He dances on Sunday, he steals women from their intendeds, he's involved in dozens of dirty dealings, and he's dating an Oriental leper. Beg pardon? I guess she's just thrown in for fun.Of course, all's well that ends well, and everything turns out okay. This movie is silent, so the acting is a bit in-your-face, and the characters are extreme, but hey. It's necessary--literacy wasn't rampant back then, so filmmakers had to make everything painfully obvious. Some people weren't able to read the title cards, and they'd be lost without the silent films' distinctive pantomime.Side benefit--the version I have on video features a nifty soundtrack by that powerhouse of the movie palace, the Wurlitzer organ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, &amp; Occasionally Impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting just to watch DeMille's first, silent film version of "The Ten Commandments", and the picture itself is pretty interesting too. It is also occasionally impressive, sometimes with the kind of DeMille flourishes that one expects, sometimes with a satisfying dramatic turn. It's quite different in its conception from the more familiar 1950's version, and so direct comparisons are not always possible, yet it holds up well by itself anyway.Rather than concentrating on the biblical story, as in the remake, here DeMille first tells an abbreviated version of the Moses/Exodus narrative, and then uses it as the thematic basis for a modern morality tale. There are many parallels between the two stories, and while the parallels are occasionally forced, they often work surprisingly well. The modern-day story is similar to many other films of the 1910's and 1920's, but it is interesting and it is told well.Although DeMille is known for his lavish spectacles, he also knew how to create some more subtle effects when he wanted to. In the modern story, some of the developments are a bit contrived, but the characters generally ring true, and the story itself is worthwhile as well. While the lavish remake with color and sound is probably going to remain more well-known, this earlier version is well worth seeing, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excuse me, gotta go and worship a Golden Calf!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever anybody says THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, we think of the fun, uplifting 1956 epic made by DeMille and starring Charleton Heston, Yul Brynner, etc. etc. Not too many people know that film is a remake of DeMille's own 1923 film of the same name. The 1923 version has so much zip to it, mainly because in it's 90 minute plus time, DeMille has to tell TWO stories. The first is the story of Moses. He has to lead the exodus from Egypt, part the Red Sea (an awesome scene done in early two-tone Technicolor) and slap some sense in his followers who wrongly decide to worship the Golden Calf. All that in 45 minutes. That means it spools out really, really fast. The rest of the film takes place in modern day San Francisco, where two brothers, one a hard working carpenter, the other, a wealthy but scheming architect battle. We know their grey haired mom is a good Christian, because she constantly carries around a Bible as big as a cinderblock!  Beautifully restored, witha great piano and organ score. This is an energetic silent well worth catching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great prologue, slow main feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cecil B. DeMille's original silent version of the Ten Commandments is mostly a heavy-handed morality play set in 1923. The prologue, which runs just over 40 minutes, shows an abbreviated version of the Biblical story of the Exodus. Most of the dialogue is taken from the Bible. Despite the technical limitations of the era, it succeeds as a fast-paced spectacular. The parting of the Red Sea is just as awe-inspiring in its own way as in the remake, and it's always interesting to see how silent actors compensated for the lack of sound with facial expressions and exaggerated gestures. The musical score is fantastic and everything clips along at a nice pace. As with the remake, it's never subtle, but it's never boring, either.I wish I could say the same about the main part of the feature. After Moses punishes the Hebrews for worshipping the golden calf, the film moves to the present day (1920s). A mother reads to her grown sons from the Bible. The two brothers are basically Goofus and Gallant. From here, everything is completely predictable.It's well done so that one can overlook the lack of subtlety. DeMille has a very explicit religious message, and he's not above bludgeoning the viewer over the head with it. That was the style of the day, and the limitations of the silent film force a certain amount of overstatement.However, unlike most films of this period, this one goes on far too long. It's about ninety minutes but seems far longer. The bad son goes out into the world, declaring that he's going to break all 10 Commandments! Naturally, he becomes a successful businessman... while his humble older brother (a carpenter, naturally) tries not to envy him or covet his wife. There's never any doubt about how it's all going to end: DeMille's message is that "the wages of sin is death", but he takes far too long to get there.The complete film is about 135 minutes, which must have been an epic length for that era. I would have enjoyed it more if the modern story had been trimmed by about 15 minutes.In his way, DeMille was the forerunner of Mel Gibson. Both are gifted filmmakers with devout religious beliefs --- short on subtlety, heavy on the bloodshed and headlong action. The 1956 remake of Ten Commandments is a spectacular example of epic film-making, and as this 1923 silent original is now included as an extra disc in the DVD, it's worth checking out. I can't imagine wanting to sit through the modern story again, though; I'll probably shut it off once Moses segues off screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triumphant film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early twenties, it was perfectly alright to show sinners revelling extravagantly and unashamedly in the sins of the flesh. All you had to do was either punish or purify them in the end, and everything would turn out just fine. This is the lesson we learn from watching the second half of Cecil B DeMille's gargantuan epic or 1923. And it is the prologue of the movie that teaches us that deMille had more money to spend on his own films than the old man upstairs. As a lavish production, TTC is probably one of CBdM's greatest achievements, surpassing in quality and size the 1950s remake, Cleopatra (1934) and all billion-or-so versions of The Squaw Man, all of which deMille would directed. His handling of his actors, his attention to detail and unbridled imagination call to mind a time when you could spend whatever amount of money you wanted on a film without being Jerry Bruckheimer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic New Print for a History Making Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 50th anniversary DVD of the 1956 'The Ten Commandments' includes Cecil B. DeMille's original 1923 version. The restored print of this history making silent film is simply amazing, so sharp and crystal clear with zero flickering. Furthermore, this version is the same, the reverse and also different from the 1956 version.It's the same in that De Mille rebuilt the same set of Ramses' city -- larger than the towers built for D. W. Griffith's 'Intolerance' (1916)-- for the '56 version, used much of the same script, camera angles and other sets. It's the reverse, because as Katherine Orrison notes on the commentary track, if a shot was done from the right side in the '23 version, it was filmed from the left in the '56 version, and vice versa. She kids us not! She's written three books about "C.B." It is different from the '56 version in two major ways. First, the story of Moses begins with him giving the ninth plague (killing the first born), and ends with him hurling the 10 Commandments down at the revellers worshipping the Golden Calf below Mount Sinai. Second, the movie then becomes a second story (the Biblical scenes are called "The Prologue"), taking place in San Francisco."The Modern Story" is about the brothers John, a carpenter (Richard Dix) and Danny, an architect (Rod La Roque) and their struggles with morality. Danny vows to break all ten commandments, and by the end of the movie, he has. Like Ramses drowned in the Red Sea, Danny, escaping to Mexico in his speed boat 'Defiance' also drowns smashed on a large rock that looks suspiciously like Mount Sinai. Note: Before Richard Dix went on to fame and success in sound movies (mostly for RKO), he starred in many other silent films-- check out his great performance in 'The Vanishing American' (1925) as an Indian.Visually interesting throughout, the film even takes place on the construction site of the Catholic cathedral in Washington Square in San Francisco as it was being built. Actually shot in the outside construction elevator on the roof, you get to see a lot of the vista of 1923 San Francisco! Let's all meet at Washington Square for the 100th anniversary of this film! Plus the whole movie really works. What sets and costumes! The parting of the Red Sea in this version is even better than the 1956 one! I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunday January 8, 4:00pm The Paramount Theater, SeattleCountless slaves pull a gleaming white sphinx, inch-by-inch, across the desert sands. Brutalized by their cruel Egyptian masters, The Children of Israel toil before the monumental city gates of Pharaoh Rameses II. The opening scenes of Cecil B. DeMille's 1923 epic "The Ten Commandments" represent the historical spectacle of Hollywood's silent era at its grandest and most expressive. DeMille blended the intensely dramatic performance of his actors with the spectacular architecture of his sets in a way that seemed to bring the past to life for the movie going audience. His exhaustive research and striving for authenticity was limited only by his personal satisfaction. Of the roughly 2500 extras used one tenth were orthodox Jews from Los Angeles, many, recent immigrants who felt they were living the history of their ancestors. The flight from Egypt includes the added surprise of two-color Technicolor while the scenes of decadence as the Golden Calf is worshiped by an undulating mob are as vibrantly electric as any ever filmed. To be fair, it bears pointing out that the forty-five minute Ancient Egypt portion of "The Ten Commandments" is only a prologue to the modern story, which today seems dated and irrelevant. Two brothers, one good and one evil, alternately respect and defy the ancient laws of Moses and live with the consequences. The San Francisco setting may be of interest to anyone with ties to "the city by the bay", specifically the 1920's North Beach neighborhood, Saints Peter and Paul Church and Washington Square Park which are all prominently featured. Sexy Nita Naldi is also delightfully vampish as the heavy-lidded other woman draped in furs. The Jeanie Macpherson screenplay attempts to draw parallels between the story of Exodus and modern life, much more successfully accomplished in Michael Curtiz 1928 epic masterpiece "Noah's Ark", but the jazz age story can't hold a candle to the grandeur of the ancient world. DeMille's original does succeed if compared to the bloated, boringly over-detailed story and hammy acting of his 1956 remake. The 1923 prologue is concise, well paced and beautifully executed. The ancient Babylon of D. W. Griffith's 1916 spectacular "Intolerance" appears staged and remote when compared to a genuine sense of seeing and feeling the "hear and now" conjured up by DeMille's City of the Pharaoh. Hollywood produced progressively greater and more fantastic historical epics as the era drew to a close, including the MGM spectacle "Ben Hur" in 1925 and DeMille's "King of Kings" in 1927." ? the spirit of the spectacle, and the joy taken in its own magic, was unique to the silent film." - William K.

		<fullReview>Today,all his epics ("ten commandments" 1 and 2,"sign of the cross" "Samson and Delilah" ...° have worn remarkably well.Like many people ,I saw the 1956 version well before the silent one.The prologue (which is very long for a prologue) has a plot similar to the 1956 version from the plagues to the golden calf orgy.Even the Parting of the Red Sea (and it's quite impressive for 1923!) and the writing of the Holy Tablets are here (it looks more like some kind of mystic firework here).As for the orgy,it's simply better than the color version.That said I like that latter version best,because the gap between the biblical tale and the modern one makes that the two parts do not hang very well,in spite of a brilliant transition : Moses and his people saga suddenly segues into a mother reading the Bible to her sons.The second part will deal with the story of two brothers,one of whom trying to break these "fusty" commandments and not be broken by them. There are interesting parallels: the workers on the building site and the slaves working for pharaoh on the pyramids,the hero who ,like "pharaoh's tribe ,is drowned in the tide" .Little by little,the film becomes slowly but inexorably overtly Christian: the momma hints to carpenters,nice carpenters,there's a short return to biblical times but depicting a scene of Jesus' s life and unlike the bad woman who became a leper in the prologue,salvation is around the corner for the evil millionaire's wife.Lines from St Matthew ("he gained the world but lost his soul") add to this feeling a redemption.Despite the reservations expressed above,De Mille was a storyteller extraordinaire,who equaled D.W .Griffith .Thou shalt not overlook him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cecil B. DeMille's Paramount EPIC "The Ten Commandments" tells the Old Testament's "Moses" story during its first hour. The "special effects" highlights are: Theodore Roberts (as Moses) parting the Red Sea, and the Biblical patriarch's thunderous receiving of God's commandments. The production is first rate throughout. After about fifty minutes of spectacle, the film switches to a "Modern Story" - wherein Mr. DeMille seeks to tell a morality story involving "The Ten Commandments".For the main story (the more memorable Moses segments were a mere "prologue"), DeMille introduces the McTavish brothers - saintly carpenter Richard Dix (as John), and partying atheist Rod La Rocque (as Dan). While Mr. Dix stays home to read The Bible, with dear mother Edythe Chapman (as Martha McTavish), Mr. La Rocque breaks Commandments, with lovely Leatrice Joy (as Mary Leigh). Of course, Dix falls in love with Ms. Joy, after she becomes his brother's wife? DeMille's morality tale is extremely heavy-handed, but nevertheless enticing, and expertly directed. The "Biblical" and "Modern" story format recalls D.W. Griffith's superior "Intolerance" (1916). The all-star cast (it's 1923, remember) performs exceptionally, with La Rocque being seen in one of his finest performances. As any actor will tell you, La Rocque was halfway there, upon receiving the "bad brother" role, over Dix - and, La Rocque runs away with the film. His is a "Best Actor"-worthy performance. Nefarious Nita Naldi (as Sally Lung) leads a strong supporting cast.All things considered, this one's a lot more fun than the 1956 re-make.********* The Ten Commandments (11/23/23) Cecil B.

		<shortDescription>Break The Ten Commandments And They'll Break You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going on 90 years since it was first released, the original The Ten Commandments can still overawe you with the spectacle of both the biblical prologue and the modern story. Modern in the sense that it was set during the Jazz Age Roaring Twenties, the 1923 when Paramount released what would become that studio's biggest moneymaker up to that time.You'll recognize the biblical prologue if you've seen the 1956 remake, it is almost a 45 minute scene for scene remake of the time that Charlton Heston and John Carradine arrive at the Egyptian court until the destruction of the Golden calf. They weren't giving Oscars back in 1923, but the parting of the Red Sea was incredible for its time and would have given Cecil B. DeMille yet another Oscar for the same event.You won't recognize a lot of the biblical prologue cast, but they were part and parcel of a DeMille stock company that he developed during silent era and continued to a lesser degree after the coming of sound. Best known probably was Estelle Taylor who was married to Jack Dempsey at the time as Miriam, the sister of Moses. The bulk of the film is the modern story which has the theme break the Ten Commandments and they'll break you. The stars are Richard Dix and Rod LaRocque a pair of brothers, one good and one bad, sons of a most pious mother Edythe Chapman. Dix is a good, honest, and steady carpenter by trade and LaRocque through his ruthlessness and who winds up breaking all the Commandments becomes the richest contractor in the state. LaRocque is pretty ruthless in his private affairs, he breaks the Commandments regarding those as well. He marries Leatrice Joy who Dix likes as well, but then gets a fetching Eurasian mistress in Nita Naldi. Nita is in the slinky and sexy tradition of all DeMille's bad girls. It all ends really bad for LaRocque as his sins catch up with him. During the modern story DeMille hand with spectacle is a good one in the scene of the church collapse and later on during the climatic escape LaRocque is attempting to make with a speedboat on a stormy night at sea.The influence of DeMille's educator father Henry and his friend David Belasco are strong here as they are in all DeMille work. The modern story is the kind of morality play that Belasco would produce and write for the stage for years. It's from the Victorian era, but the Roaring Twenties audience wanted something that reflected traditional values occasionally as if nervously waiting for its excesses to catch up. It's partly the reason why they could find comfort in a Congregationalist president of the USA in Calvin Coolidge. Though the story is unbelievably dated, DeMille's cinematic techniques are hardly that. The original Ten Commandments in many ways will tell you about its creator warts and all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hope God doesn't smite me for the line above, but the effect is somewhat obvious. But as obvious as the Jello used for the Red Sea parting is, it cannot take away from how great this film really is. Now don't get me wrong, the 1956 version is unbelievable itself, but while looking at this one you get a sense of DeMille trying to tell us something about ourselves, our way of life, and of course, what we are doing wrong. The prologue itself is extremely quick. That could be because I saw the '56 version prior to this one. The rest of the story drags a little bit, but not too much, don't get me wrong this is a long movie (the package reads 146 minutes, it's really 136), but if you have the time you could make it through in one sitting. I'd recommend renting this movie (only if you can find it though) because it really is worth watching it and seeing how we are today and how we can make ourselves better by doing certain things a certain way. I can't put it in to words though, only this film can. It's an intriguing motion picture experience to behold. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bible + DeMille + Roaring Twenties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This nine decade-old picture still remains a great surprise. Seemingly inferior to its glamorous remake, today, it occurs to have stood a test of time. But what comes to mind first is not the entire movie but its renowned prologue, screenwriter Jeanie MacPherson's initial idea, the action of which is set more than 3,000 years ago when Children of Israel were led to freedom from bondage of false masters: a unique answer to human cry for a better world. Made at the time when epics saw their beginnings and not being able to echo any earlier productions (except for only few made in Italy or D.W. Griffith's INTOLERANCE), Cecil B DeMille's silent TEN COMMANDMENTS was a highly new, fresh screen experience. When the iconic screen Moses, Charlton Heston, was born, Theodore Roberts (as Chris Scott Edwards described him "wild-eyed, ferocious and unkempt") embodied the prophet for the first time in cinema and for the first time under DeMille. And, unlike the 'greater than life' overlong 1956 remake which could have been titled MOSES' PHASES OF LIFE depicting a prince, an exile, a deliverer, the lawgiver, this 1923 version is, actually, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS because of its two parts where not 'laws' but 'the Law,' as DeMille referred to it, is truly at the core of its broadest appeal. Moreover, due to the context it emerged from (post-Great War period with Hollywood incidents like Fatty Arbuckle scandal mentioned by Katherine Orrison), there was a need for a moral message through the medium. Therefore, at the dawn of cinema, Paramount was lucky to 'promote' the Decalogue and release a skillful combination of the Bible as its source, DeMille as its deliverer and the roaring twenties as its initial addressee. Since The Exodus and the modern part can be treated as two separate films differently seen, let me divide my review in a similar fashion.EXODUS. Lauded as "quite the landmark of the director" (Sean Axmaker, 2011); amazing with "their sheer weirdness and scale" filled with "Vegas-feel to this sermon" (C.S Edwards); "DeMille's ultra drama of the ages" (Kyle Westphal), it is not hard to agree with all the 'praise the work' opinions. Everything is spectacular about it, including 500 carpenters, 400 painters, 600 chariots and its silent nature provides the movie with additional mystery. Because of its considerably short length, it clearly corresponds to the intentions herein incorporated. Great matte system by the technical director Roy Pomeroy, marvelous City of Rameses (DeMille's Lost City rediscovered years later by Peter Brosnan), some interesting details and the cast, including Estelle Taylor as Miriam, Charles de Rochefort as Rameses, Julia Faye as Pharao's wife (prototype of Nefretiri's character), Theodore Roberts as Moses, of course, and hundreds of extras of Jewish ancestry. Although the filming locations were less authentic than in the remake (though still a 'location', no 'vacation' as Rita Kissin memorably recalls), the extras, authentically stun us including 250 Orthodox Jews from Los Angeles who really experienced deep personal contribution to the film. The Camp DeMille became their 'tent' while they could truly identify with their ancestors, renewing their identity, holding the banners with the Star of David with eyes filled with sand, perhaps, but hearts with praise and joy. DeMille himself, whose mother Beatrice was Jewish, stated about these extras that "they give the best possible performance as the Children of Israel." No accent was of any significance but just their looks and hearts set in the story. Leatrice Joy, who was also among the extras observed that "they were living the time." And what remains in today's viewers' memories after viewing the Exodus? Every minute seems precious from the very first image of the Sphynx, the colossal City of Rameses, the hauntingly effective organ score by Gaylord Carter, the grandiose images of the pharaoh and his court, the Passover night, 600 chariots, the Red Sea sequence, the pillar of fire to the Mount Sinai sequence and the scenes with Golden Calf (Marshall). With the tablets of the Law and Miriam, Moses' sister uttering "I have worshiped idols and become a leper" our attention is drawn onto the roaring twenties when sin and righteousness clashed powerfully...MODERN STORY touched by 'defiance' and 'redemption' ? a pure product of generation clash in the roaring twenties is a debatable part. Inspired by F.C. Nelson's phrasing "You cannot break the Ten Commandments - they will break you," it appears to be a solid 'modern' parallel to the universalism of those commandments. And here, it all depends on audiences and rightly so. What if they don't agree? Just ignoring the philosophical dilemma, let me address the cinematic one and state: unlike the Exodus, the part requires a viewer to be accustomed to silent cinema, its style, methods and conventions. Here, the opinions differ and tend to be critical of the entire achievement. "Dated" (Marshall Weiss); "split identity production" (Axmaker); "a series of disastrous plot turns" (Hal Erikson)... Among the critics was Mae Tinee of Chicago Tribune. Mr DeMille, in his defense, memorably observed the destruction caused by 'mental and emotional Red Sea.' Actually, I agree with him. As the brothers may occur clichéd, the part includes some stunning cinematography, lavish decor, great images of San Francisco and, foremost, noteworthy performances. 'Villains are more memorable' corresponds with the character of Dan (Rod LaRocque)- 'one emblematic modern man who violates all ten commandments' (Westphal). Mary Leigh (Leatrice Joy) parallels to Miriam, Nita Naldi is the fire incarnate VAMPire while Martha McTavish represents the old generation, the reminder of the covenant's timelessness. In the death scene, she clearly makes her own Exodus from the Old Testamental 'law' to the New Testamental 'Love' and DeMille makes his point most powerfully. In the final biblical reference, the divided becomes united in order to lead all to the light. With Christ as the new Passover of humanity, DeMille brings the movie to a jubilant Christian conclusion and a radiant renewing experience of risen human being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll take DeMille's paraphrase of Scripture any day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cecil B. DeMille's silent epic certainly ranks among the most audacious Old Testament melodramas ever made, jumping in one dazzling edit from a 90-minute exodus out of ancient Egypt to modern (c. 1923) San Francisco, where the possibility of divine retribution is never more than a tremor away.The biblical prologue, a complete film in itself, condenses the material DeMille would later use for his entire 1956 remake, with a similar emphasis on spectacular set design, impressive special effects, and stoic overacting. But the plot really picks up steam after it shifts to the 20th century, depicting the fraternal rift between a crooked building contractor out to break all ten of the Lord's commandments, and his saintly younger brother (a carpenter, naturally). The older, unscrupulous sibling is cheating on the construction costs of a new cathedral, and because DeMille's God is a vengeful God the sinner pays a heavy penalty for his greed, indirectly killing his own mother when the walls come tumbling down, and later contracting leprosy from his deadly Eurasian mistress! The moralizing is no less heavy-handed than in most silent melodramas, but DeMille was always a better showman than a preacher, and at times it almost seems the unintended humor of this typically overwrought Sunday School lesson was deliberate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DeMille's silent version of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is really two films in one - specifically, a 90-minute feature introduced by a 45-minute prologue. The prologue is the familiar story of Moses (Theodore Roberts) and the Exodus from Egypt which plays like a rough sketch of the 1956 remake. As is typical of the silent DeMille oeuvre, a moral lesson is presented by juxtaposing two stories with parallel themes from widely different eras. The lessons here seem to be: ignore the Ten Commandments at your peril and love God. Just as the ancient Israelites suffered for their sins, the protagonist of the modern story (Rod LaRocque as a contractor who becomes wealthy by deceitful business practices) pays dearly for breaking one Commandment after another, and if ever there was an actor born to break them it was the sleek, devilishly handsome LaRocque. In this plot, he is pitted against his opposite: his own brother, the rough-hewn Richard Dix as an honest carpenter who plays by the rules and stays poor. The self-sacrificing Dix is so good-hearted that he gives up the woman he loves (Leatrice Joy) because he knows she loves LeRocque. Nita Naldi appears briefly and unforgettably as a leprous Eurasian vamp who plays a pivotal role in LaRocque's downfall.The prologue's special effects look crude by modern CGI standards but God's utterance of the Commandments in the form of shimmering titles against a whirl of sparks has a stylish beauty all its own, and the choreography of the Golden Calf worship looks as if it might have inspired Fritz Lang's crowd scenes in METROPOLIS a few years later. Charles DeRoche (whatever happened to HIM?) is impressive as Pharaoh Rameses.The feature benefits from excellent production values, generally fast pacing and stunning cinematography; the organ accompaniment is even above par, with imaginative use of the instrument. One problem: when characters come indoors after having been drenched to the bone in driving rainstorms their clothing appears to dry off way too quickly. And when Leatrice Joy steals a "hot dog" (which looks more like a hamburger) from a diner, and runs for blocks with it in the drenching rain, it seems to stay intact. It is also hard to believe that a woman could emerge, dressed in a full street suit, including hat and veil, from a trans- Pacific journey inside a sack of jute! But hey ? this is the world of silent cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a little preachy, but good nevertheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first version of 'The Ten Commandments' is two films in one, really, and within its two hour running time you can see hints and ideas which were taken forward by other filmmakers in later years; not just DeMille referencing himself with the parting of the Red Sea in his 1950s remake, but in The Fountainhead (referencing the shot with the lift going up the side of the cathedral), Psycho (Nina Naldi pulling the curtain off the rail as she falls), and Sunset Boulevard (Naldi again, hands like claws as she extracts herself from the sack of jute in which she smuggled herself).The story is fairly simple - most of the first hour is the standard Moses and let my people go tale from Exodus in the Old Testament, well developed and shot with some great special effects (the aforementioned parting of the sea). The rest of the film is modern moral - Edythe Chapman, a god-fearing old lady, has two sons - Danny (Rod La Rocque)and John (Richard Dix). Danny doesn't believe in the Ten Commandments and considers them outmoded and a barrier to success. When Mary (Leatrice Joy) comes into their lives, she causes problems between the brothers and unwittingly sets Danny on a path which leads him to slowly break one Commandments after another.As this is a moral story, it does get a little preachy in places, but in the context of the time it was made that was probably expected. It is a spectacle and an epic of sorts, although not as much as its remake - it is actually a simple but effective film, which although a little creaky and not boasting the most subtle performances, still stands up to viewing today, and makes a fascinating comparison to Charlton Heston's Moses years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (Cecil B. De Mille, 1923) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was another Biblical epic from the Silent era which I had long wanted to check out; even so, I had owned the DVD (accompanying the more popular 1956 version of the same events, from the same showman director no less, and which has received countless viewings from yours truly) for some time before I finally got to it. As with the later NOAH'S ARK (1928), virtually watched simultaneously, it seems that film-makers of the time were unsure of the appeal of such religious epics, so that they had to present them within the context of a modern story; still, De Mille's THE KING OF KINGS (a milestone in itself for being the first and, for a time, only picture to show Jesus' face) preceded that Michael Curtiz work by a year and it was set exclusively in the time of Christ. In this case, only the first 50 minutes or so are dedicated to the familiar tale involving Moses (needless to say, the dull Theodore Roberts is no match for the stoic Charlton Heston in the remake): the exodus, the parting of the Red Sea, the writing of the tablets and the Golden Calf; these are clearly heavily streamlined in comparison with the almost 4-hour long 1956 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and, in spite of their obvious care, gargantuan scale and excellent special effects, can feel unsatisfying in that respect...especially when the parallel story is so hokey, unnecessarily inflated and, at the end of the day, somewhat ordinary! The latter sees a Bible-thumping matriarch (which she proudly holds even when posing for a portrait), her two sons and the girl who comes between them: one of the boys (played by Richard Dix) is righteous ? and, as his mother claims, engaged in a skill (carpentry) which has produced some notable exponents (alluding naturally to Christ himself) ? while the other mocks religion and vows to become somebody by his own merits. Eventually, we find him as a top contractor and, perhaps to make amends, takes it upon himself to build a church; however, to cut costs, he reduces the amount of cement required to make the concrete, with the result that the walls are weak and liable to collapse at any time (coincidentally, the very previous day I watched a film in which a character had faced a similar dilemma ? GIVE US THIS DAY aka Christ IN CONCRETE [1949]): this ruse is discovered by Dix, appointed "boss-carpenter" on the project, and he confronts his brother?but, before anything can be done about it, the whole edifice falls on top of the mother who picks just that moment to visit the premises! The morally-corrupt sibling even forsakes his wife (the destitute girl they had taken in and whom Dix relinquished on his account) for an Asian temptress, whom he eventually kills (the only commandment, according to his spouse, not yet broken by him); in the end, the boy gets his come-uppance and Dix can reclaim his lady. While the two sections may seem to jell better than those in NOAH'S ARK, the overall achievement is a lesser one ? and not just to it, but THE KING OF KINGS (by the way, Christ makes a 'cameo' appearance here towards the end!) and, most importantly, the later version?if still quite worthwhile in itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isaw both versions of Ten Commandments on a special DVC, so I suppose one would call it Tenty Commandments.I also watched the commentary for both films. The poem on the page where Mary Leigh writes Good Bye near the end of the prologues is the poem Helas by Oscar Wilde. The narrator of the commentary did not know this, so I feel that I have staged something of a coup. It does not look like the place in the book where Mary pressed the orange blossoms, she takes them out then flips a few pages before writing.The narrator also compared the rock where Danny wrecks his boat to Mount Sainai, but it looks more to me like the rock at the edge of the Red Sea, the Israelites destination, and figuratively the Rock on which Pharao crashed. The Orthodox Monastary of Saint Catherine at the foot of Mount Sinai is called a Greek ORTHODOX monastery in some of the commentary on the 1956 film. The Orthodox Church of Sainai is an independent Orthodoc Church, it is the Church of Sinai, so the monastery is a Sinai Orthjodox monastery. It is a common misnomer to call any Orthodox Church the Greek Orthodox Church. The Greek Orthodox Church is the Church of Greece only, other countries have their own Orthodox Churches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ten Commandments marks the beginning of the second wave of the Hollywood epic. Modelled on the contemporary/ancient parallel storytelling of Intolerance ? the crowning achievement of the first wave ? and its subject matter decided by a poll of cinema-goers, this is among the most significant and typically DeMillean of DeMille's pictures.DeMille had first coupled a historical tale with a modern day framing story in 1916's Joan the Woman, and even during the years when the historical feature was out of fashion (approximately 1918 ? 1921) he several times added a little metaphorical foray into the past to his contemporary dramas, such as Male and Female and Manslaughter. Here, it is still the modern day narrative which makes up the bulk of the picture's 130-odd minutes, and yet it is the spectacular biblical prologue that everyone remembers.DeMille had always had a talent for directing crowd scenes, giving inspiring pep talks to the mass whilst giving specific directions to the individuals. Here he works with the biggest group of extras he had ever handled, and yet he has lost none of his touch. He gives character to the multitude by focusing on a number of individuals within it, and yet when he pulls back to show the whole crowd you can still see the attention to detail, with a hundred different things going on. The stupendous sets also make an impact in themselves, but DeMille is shrewd enough to reveal them gradually, and places them squarely in the context of being symbolic of evil. The pharaoh's palace may be impressive, but DeMille ensures that the works of God ? the pillar of fire, the parting of the red sea, the lightning on Sinai ? are more so. Oddly, he could be accused of doing the opposite in his 1956 remake, in which the Egyptian city is absolutely awe-inspiring, whereas the special effects representing acts of God are somewhat pathetic even for the day, and certainly less effective than those in 1923. But DeMille had changed a lot by that time.In contrast to the prologue, the contemporary story is somewhat lacklustre. It has much in common with other DeMille dramas from around this period, although it is pretty mediocre by that standard. Particularly jarring is the overuse of intertitles. Five years earlier DeMille had been a master of purely visual narrative, and the titles were only there when absolutely necessary. As time went by however, as DeMille had become more pious and his screenwriter Jeanie Macpherson had become more pretentious, so had the photoplays become more wordy. All the better for preaching with, as far as self-appointed messenger-of-God DeMille was concerned, but his pictures began to lack the grace and smoothness they had once had.With scenes fragmented into smaller pieces, and characters unable to open their mouths without a superfluous title spelling their words out to the audience, the acting also suffers. Richard Dix, Rod La Rocque, Leatrice Joy and Nita Naldi are all adequate performers, but none of them really gets time or space to emote as much as they ought to for the story. Nevertheless, DeMille was still a master of the powerful, iconic image, and there are enough memorable shots here to keep things interesting. Among the standouts are Nita Naldi's hands emerging from a tear in a sack, the straight-up shot in the lift as Leatrice Joy ascends and Naldi ripping the curtain off its hooks, nearly forty years before the almost identical shot in Hitchcock's Psycho. It is images like this which reign supreme in DeMille's cinema, and it is from around this point on that they become more important than the credibility of the story or the actors.DeMille's Ten Commandments proved to be highly influential. Other studios got to work on their own superproductions, the western would become epic with The Iron Horse, and even Douglas Fairbanks next picture, The Thief of Bagdad, was steeped in DeMillean grandeur. Further afield, UFA studios in Germany and Abel Gance in France were also working on the principle that big is beautiful. Ten Commandments indicated the future for DeMille himself as well. Not only was it the first of the pictures that would secure his legacy as the ultimate biblical filmmaker, but the fact that the prologue is absolutely breathtaking and the contemporary drama lacks bite, hints towards his eventually becoming a director purely of epics. It's also rather telling that he loved the Old Testament God of plagues and smiting, because that is probably more or less how DeMille saw himself. He hammered home his messages with the spectacular and the incredible. A shock-and-awe filmmaker preaching the word of a shock-and-awe God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early epic-morality play still feels modern enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DeMille's first attempt at the story of Moses has more in common with such other silent films contrasting the ancient past to stories of today, than it does to his later epic retelling of the story. Griffith's "Intolerance" 7 years earlier had intercut several stories of sin and violence to show that the more man changes, the more he stays the same; Fritz Lang's "Destiny" and Carl Dreyer's "Leaves from Satan's Book" (both 1921) also worked out biblical themes in both ancient and modern contexts. All four directors were at one point or another quite serious Christians, though DeMille seems to have been the most obsessive in his faith, and certainly his many films on Biblical themes are often more obvious and blunt in their attempts at pedagogy.Which is not to say that "The Ten Commandments" is just a lesson in "thou shalt nots"; but it is throughout informed of a very deep, and perhaps naive faith that the stories of the past are alive and exactly transferable to the lives we have today. In this case, we see a man break essentially every commandment in his quest for personal greatness, destroying in the process his own life and those of many around him, including his own mother. DeMille doesn't intercut multiple story lines like his predecessors, but rather uses the Biblical story as a 50-minute "prologue" to one feature-length story taking place in modern-day Los Angeles.It's fascinating to watch the film if you've just watched the later version, as I did; the prologue is almost exactly the same as the last 50 minutes of the '56 version, picking up in the middle of the plagues that Moses has set upon Egypt. Like the later film, only the killing of the first-born is given significant play, and the majority of this section is given over to the flight from Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea (jello!) and destruction of the pursuing Egyptians, and the creation of the Ten Commandments and Moses' fury at the idolators. It's all very well done, in many respects more thrilling and powerful than in the later film, with many scenes that DeMille obviously liked enough to re-do almost shot-for-shot - the flight of the Israelites from the Egyptian city, and in particular the shot of Moses standing in front of them exhorting them to flee are good examples. Theodore Roberts was 62 when the film was made and looks a bit crazy and obsessive - he certainly feels more like the older Moses to me than Charlton Heston, though Charles de Rochefort doesn't leave a huge impression as Rameses. All in all, it's quite a spectacle and segues nicely into...The modern-day story, of two carpenter/architect brothers, one ambitious and unscrupulous and the other honest and devoted to their saintly, Bible-reading mother, and how they vie for the love of a vagrant girl who comes to their doorstep, is obviously freighted with the weight of the prologue: the two brothers quarrel over God, there is honoring and not honoring of the parent, coveting of the neighbor's (or brother's) wife, stealing, etc. The central theme couldn't be more obviously stated as they build a cathedral, which ultimately collapses due to the bad brother's cheap materials, killing someone dear. Every commandment gets tested and broken at one point or another, but what's fascinating is how seamlessly they're all woven into a relatively simple story and how DeMille refuses to cast the "bad" brother as completely evil, or the "good" brother as entirely strong and virtuous. Only the mother comes across as something of a caricature. Nicely lit and shot throughout - the rain sequence where the girl first comes to the home of the family is very real and moving, and only the scenes involving the unscrupulous brother's mistress seem at all overwrought. This is overall a more graceful and disciplined film than the later version, or any of DeMille's work that I've seen so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ten Commandments, The (1923) *** (out of 4) DeMille's first attempt at this story tells two different stories. The opening prologue, running just under and hour, sees Moses (Theodore Roberts) freeing the slaves, parting the Red Sea and eventually correcting those who wish to worship the Golden Calf. The second half of the story centers on two brothers; one good (Richard Dix), the other bad (Rod La Rocque) and both in love with the same woman (Leatrice Joy). The bad brother ends up marrying the girl and becoming quite rich by breaking the law in his building contractor position but all of his sins are eventually going to catch up with him. This is certainly a strange mixture of a film because I was a little surprised to see DeMille spend most of its 136-minute running time with the two brothers. The beginning stuff with Moses is pretty much just a prologue but it's a rather interesting one needless to say. While the special effects can't hold a candle to the eventual remake what we have here is still a treat for the eyes. The parting of the Red Sea certainly sticks out and while it's somewhat obvious how it was done the effect still holds up and manages to impress. The chariot crashes, which were apparently real, also stand out as does the large number of extras to carry out the Pharaoh scenes. Roberts, a DeMille regular, is pretty good in the role of Moses even though he comes off a tad bit too passionate. The second half of the film is rather hit and miss but for the most part I enjoyed it as well. The real standout here is the performance by Richard Dix who would of course go on to have an impressive career in film. He steals the film as the more timid brother who puts God before everything and his passion, a deep one, comes across very well with Dix hitting all the right notes. La Rocque is also devilishly good in his role and very believable as well. Joy makes for a good "woman in the middle" as well. Edythe Chapman, another DeMille regular, plays the boys mother but doesn't fair as good. Her character is so poorly written and over the top in her religious beliefs and demands that you can't help but start to hate her when she's suppose to be the one holding the family together. I wasn't impressed with the performance either but I'm going to guess much of this is more to do with the screenplay than anything else. The biggest problem with the film is that the second half is pretty common for the type of melodrama of the day. While it's told very well by DeMille it still comes off rather predictable and straight forward. With that said, this 1923 silent still holds up quite well on all levels and folks should certainly check it out to see what DeMille would later remake. The director would fair better several years later with The King of Kings.</fullReview>

I'd like to see them revise just the modern portion. I would bring the story up to the 21st century with perhaps changing the characters to Afro-Americans. The mother can become a very religious church lady who meets her fatal end during an Easter service when the church collapses. You would involve hundreds of people and not just her as in the original. The feuding brothers show the current status of Afro-Americans today. The upper and lower class. Maybe someone seeing this just might. The modern story may relate more to people's lives today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeMille's mega-tsunami against orthodox protestantism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moses spent forty days on Mount Sinai where he received numerous commandments and laws, described in Exodus XX-XXXI. The Ten Commandments (Ex.XX) particularly apply to Christian religions and denominations.Inspired by Griffith's 'Intolerance' DeMille uses two historical periods to emphasize the film's moral. DeMille does not modify the original Jewish origin of his source, although he underlines the Christian commandments. The script of the famous prologue was literally taken from Exodus. The church in The Story is not clearly a protestant or Roman catholic house of worship. However, when the orthodox Mrs. McTavish enters the church it collapses. Her famous last words: '...whatever you've done is all my fault. I taught you to fear God in stead of to love him..' also indicate that DeMille hardly sympathizes with orthodox denominations. In the prologue DeMille's epic reaches a magnificent high-point when the Red Sea tsunami protects the fleeing Jewish people before it swallows the Egyptian forces. The Story lacks such a climax. In fact Mrs.McTavish and her Bible becomes tedious in her struggle against the evil that her boys have ended up in. DeMille's 1923 version of The Ten Commandments may be a mega-tsunami against orthodox protestantism, it is still a mass of light for the less orthodox moviegoer that believes in cinema only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the new miniseries and the 1956 masterpiece, the 1923, when it covers from the Bible, only takes text from one book out of four books on Moses' life, the book of Exodus. However, it only covers a tiny bit of Exodus as it goes to modern times halfway through the film, and it explains (silently) the meaning of God's laws. What it does cover from the Torah, though, is very accurate. Very accurate, until the actual giving of The Ten Commandments! Accurate with the other scenes on releasing the slaves and parting the sea, but when it gets to the scene that makes the title, it is horrible! Miriam performs ADULTERY on the Golden calf, not only idolatry, but ADULTERY, when I believe she didn't really get involved with the Golden calf anyway! Anyone who has read the book of Numbers knows how Miriam turns against Moses' wife and judges her for her nationality, well hows this, instead, the writers made her turn into a leper for worshiping the Golden calf! Wrong place, wrong story! They must be pathetic writers I tell you! Another thing, if you want to know how the Israelites were really punished from the idolatry at the Golden calf, think slaughter with swords like the Bible says, not getting swallowed by the Earth like the film makers made it! If you want to see them get swallowed by the Earth, look in Numbers, where they question Moses' leadership, and the Earth swallows them up, and it is called the swallowing of Korah! This happens in the 1956 one too! Wrong place Mr. DeMille! I give two stars for how much this film covers, and three stars for how accurate it is. Although inaccurate, still watch it, just don't take it seriously!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this SUPPOSED to be encouraging atheism?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I reviewed "The Ten Commandments" (1956), I received a lot of 'Not Helpful' ratings. I assume this is because, unlike the average review, I did NOT particularly like the film and said so. Once again, I buck the crowd as I definitely did NOT like this previous version as well. In the case of both films, I seriously wonder whether or not the movies actually were a boon to atheists because the films were so incredibly bad--even with the incredible Egyptian sets.Unlike the more famous 1956 version, only the first 56 minutes of the film are about the Jews and the creation of the Commandments. The biggest differences you'll notice is that Moses is a very superficial character--and has very little to do in most of the film. In addition, the Children of Israel actually leave Egypt about 20-25 minutes into the film--and it's a 136 minute film. The rest of the film is actually set in the present day (1923) and is a very, very heavy-handed morality tale with absolutely no hint of subtlety--none. It comes on so strong and heavy-handed that I am sure many will laugh at its histrionics and silly plot.So what is to like about this film. Well, first and foremost, the DVD copy is perhaps the most pristine I have ever seen in a silent film--it's very, very crisp and clean. And, the Egyptian sets (as I mentioned above) are very nice. Apart from that, the rest is just pretty silly. The famed parting of the red sea looked like melty jello. And, imagine my surprise when I later read on IMDb that's really all it was!!! And, as for the story it was bad in two serious ways. First, the creation of the Commandments section was just too superficial and dispassionate--like the folks are acting out some half-baked passion play--where they really aren't too concerned with quality--just getting the stupid thing done! Second, the modern portion is much worse with it's message that comes across with all the subtlety of a 2x4 upside your skull!! As a result, unless you are a die-hard silent film fan or an atheist who hates God, don't bother with this silly film. Why Cecil B. DeMille has somehow been considered a genius for his (anti-) religious epics, I have no idea! By the way a few final thoughts. First, despite both of DeMille's films saying to the contrary, archaeological evidence AND written accounts of the day indicate the Jews did NOT build the pyramids but professional builders. Second, why did the Godly mother die in the film?! Didn't this seem to reinforce the notion that God is not real?! Talk about an illogically constructed religious message!! Though, now that I think about it, illogic was DeMille's forte--with nudity and bestiality in his other 'religious' epic "Sign of the Cross"!! And, though it was NOT a DeMille film, think about the original "Ben Hur"--as in the end, Jesus STAYED DEAD!!! What a whacked out message! All very Pre-Code in their sensibilities and all CLAIMING to be family religious entertainment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion the prologue is not that much good, Moses is not that much convincing. But the story itself is great and the scenes of the parting of the Red Sea and of Jesus healing a woman are both indeed marvelous.</fullReview>
