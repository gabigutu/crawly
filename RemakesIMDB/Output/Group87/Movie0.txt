		<shortDescription>Cagney as Side Dish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great James Cagney, top-billed in big letters, doesn't show up till the movie's second third, and probably has less screen time than Dudley Digges, who plays the eee-vill reform-school potentate. But when Jimmy arrives, as a deputy commissioner of something-or-other out to reform reform schools, he slashes the air with his hands and jumps on the balls of his feet and spits out punchy Warners-First National dialogue with all the customary, and expected, panache. The psychology in this crisp antique, one of Warners' many efforts to assert its place as the "socially conscious" studio, doesn't run deep: Digges is bad just because the script requires him to be, and there's the quaint notion that juvenile delinquents will turn into swell kids if they're just given a dash of autonomy. But it's made in that spare, fast style that the studio specialized in, and it never bores. Frankie Darro, who got into all kinds of onscreen trouble during a brief tenure as Warners' favorite Rotten Street Kid, is an ideal JD -- a handsome, charismatic toughie with a pug nose and a hate-filled stare that could wither steel. No kid actor today can touch him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney and the kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cagney, racketeer and political ward heeler, get to become a Deputy Commissioner of Corrections and visits a boys reform school. The catch is that Cagney is not in it for the graft, he genuinely wants to make a difference in the lives of the kids there because he comes from a background like their's.The villain of the piece is Dudley Digges who is a grafting chiseler and a sanctimonious hypocrite to boot. One of the subtexts of the plot of The Mayor of Hell is that these kids are mostly immigrants and those that judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here a few generations. Note in the mess hall scene as Digges offers a prayer of thanks for the food they are about to receive, Digges is eating well, but the kids are getting quality you wouldn't feed to your pet.Cagney has his own troubles back in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the lam. That puts Digges back in charge and setting up the film for it's climax.The Mayor of Hell was a typical product from the working class studio. And because it was pre-Code it gets pretty gruesome at times. A later version of this, Crime School, with Humphrey Bogart and the Dead End Kids, was a more sanitized remake.Although Cagney is fine in the lead role as is Madge Evans the school nurse, the acting honors go to Dudley Digges. Hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunken, but kindly, one legged ship's surgeon in Mutiny on the Bounty. But Digges is a fine player and a joy to watch in every film he's in. This film is not shown too often because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays. A whole lot of minorities would be offended today. Still it's a fine film.Interestingly enough a few years ago the film Sleepers came out and it touched on some of the same issues. I guess films about reform schools don't change in any time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Mayor Of Hell" has the feel of an early Dead End Kids film, but with a much harder edge and very few light spots, preceding the first appearance of the Dead Enders by four years. James Cagney has a full screen opening credit, even though technically, the 'mayor' of the movie's title is actually portrayed by Frankie Darro, one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes. Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a young tough who's befriended by 'Patsy' Gargan (Cagney), and is elected to the position when Gargan takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatory.Warner Brothers made a lot of these types of films, attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that knew only too well about the effects of crime and poverty. This movie is quite gritty, with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping, as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a Jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school. The rules at the reformatory are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut; step out of line and you answer personally to Warden Thompson (Dudley Digges).Cagney's role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous, since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory, on the outside he's still nominally in control of a criminal racket. The film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation, the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as Gargan awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen. Not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this.Warner Brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled "Crime School", featuring Humphrey Bogart in the Cagney role, and Billy Halop in the Frankie Darro part. If you're partial to the Dead End Kids you'll probably like the latter film better, since it also offers familiar faces like Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. However the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too, with Bogart's warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout. Both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters, in 'Mayor', Madge Evans is a reform minded nurse that falls for Cagney's character.Curiously, a lot of James Cagney's early films aren't commercially available, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on Turner Classics, or source the film from a private collector. Personally, I can't get enough of this kind of stuff, and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the Thirties and Forties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precursor to the Dead End Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five years before the film Dead End hit theaters, this film was produced. This was definitely a film that tried to show what reformatories were really like. In most cases, the kids who were sent there didn't become reformed, they only came out harder and moved on to bigger crimes. James Cagney is great in this early role as Patsy, the racketeer who tries to keep the kids from making some of the same mistakes that he did by making conditions better for the boys in the camp. Dudley Digges played the perfect villain in Thompson, the warden of the school. He pretty much showed how when the odds were against Thompson and his cronies that he was nothing more than a coward. Also Allen Jenkins, who ironically would appear a few years later in the aforementioned Dead End, provided a lot of the humor as Patsy's stooge "Uncle Mike". Too bad this little gem is rarely shown on television anymore or that it is currently not out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before the Dead-End Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the Dead End Kids, there was Frankie Darro. Forgotten today, he epitomized angry desperate youth during those early depression years. Here he comes across with his usual hot-headed intensity, enough to make up for a nonthreatening small size. In fact, Darro acts a lot like a younger version of Cagney, which is no accident since the story line depends on Cagney seeing a lot of himself among the brutalized boys of the reform school. Without that, his transformation from racketeer to reformer makes little sense.Some good scenes, such as the regimented mess hall with its robotic commands and synchronized quick-step. Also, the movie really comes alive during the well-staged riot scene. The raging mob, flickering shadows and wildly burning torches create a disturbingly hellish scene befitting the title. Still, unless I missed something, the mob really is responsible for the cruel Dudley Digges death, allowing the boys to get away with murder or at least manslaughter no matter how much Digges deserves it. This may be an example of justice prevailing over the law during those pre-code days.Showing how closely the school's operation is tied to greedy political patronage provides an interesting touch. Nonetheless, Cagney's conversion from corrupt ward healer to the George Washington of a boy's republic remains something of a stretch. And I'm sure the stereotype of the Jewish kid may have brought some chuckles in that day, but not in this post-holocaust period. Then too, the black kid's dad may be a crude stereotype, but the boy isn't, participating importantly in republic activities. Notice how subtly his role emerges, probably so as not to offend some audiences. Still, it was a nervy move for the time. Notice also, how deglamorized the boys are. With the many shapes and sizes, they look as though they were recruited off the streets-- another nice touch. As in most Warner Bros. pictures of the time, there's an atmosphere of New Deal reform, embodied here by the understanding judge who's willing to try unorthodox methods to remedy social ills. All in all, the film stands as an entertaining period piece, with a humane message that stands the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough melodrama from the Warner mill...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JAMES CAGNEY gets top billing in THE MAYOR OF HELL but it's really little tough guy FRANKIE DARRO who has the central role of a boy from the slums who lands in a reform school run by a ruthless warden (DUDLEY DIGGES) interested only in punishing the boys while he cooks the books. Darro makes quite an impression with his hostile looks, locking glances with the warden at every turn with eyes blazing with hatred.It takes the entrance of Cagney to change things around, an ex- gangster who has been deputized to help run things at the reformatory and who sympathizes with the plights of the boys, especially Darro who reminds him of his own tough days as a street punk. JAMES CAGNEY puts all of his usual energy into the role of the do-gooder who changes things around, along with cooperative Nurse Griffith (MADGE EVANS), and is there when the going gets tough and things revert back to their nasty ways during his brief absence.The last half-hour of the film gets a little too melodramatic as the kids take matters into their own hands after the warden causes the death of one of their fellow inmates. There's a climactic scene where they put him on trial. When he escapes their clutches by jumping out a window, a chase follows and a barn is burned down forcing him to jump to his death. The plot contrivances that follow are hard to swallow, but for Jimmy and Madge Evans at least there's a happy ending.ALLEN JENKINS is a welcome presence for comic relief but the tone of the film borders on heavy prison melodrama almost all the way.DUDLEY DIGGES plays the unsympathetic role of the sadistic warden fairly well, but I still think of him as the befuddled detective who has a hard time pinning down RAFFLES (Ronald Colman) in that Scotland Yard yarn.For Cagney fans, this is a glimpse of him at his talented best in an early role. Archie Mayo directs the project in his brisk, no nonsense Warner style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Typical Hokey-But-Entertaining Early '30s Cagney Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a typically fast-moving entertaining movie of the early 1930s. When you have James Cagney in the lead, these "pre-Code" films are even better: just fun stuff to watch. Usually, when films are "dated," it's a negative but not so with films from 1930-1934. Yeah, with the slang and the attitudes, dress, hairstyles, etc., they are dated but that's a big part of the fun. These films have an edge to them that almost always are fun to view.They also have a corniness which is appealing and fascinating. You see people - like the juvenile delinquents pictured in this film and their goofy parents - that you just don't see in any period but this one (early '30s). Early on this movie, the kids go before the judge and you sit and just laugh at these crazy characters that appear in court on behalf of their kids, one after the other. Yes, we get the stereotypical emotional Italian father; the Jewish dad; the Anglo-Saxon mom and a few other moms who all, in dramatic form, plead theirs is "a good boy." Even though things are predictable in some cases, you don't mind because everyone in here is so much fun to watch.This also teaches you that kids were punks 75 years ago, too, stealing, robbing, mugging, lying - hey, that's the human condition. This movie debunks the theory that "people were nicer back in the old days." No, people have always been rotten or good. The degree was aided by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. Here, we get a bunch of "Dead End" kids who wind up in Reform School.The ridiculous and stupidly-liberal storyline has kids acting immediately like angels once they run the show at the reform school; not punished in the slightest for causing a man to fall to his death and setting the institution on fire (the explanation: he was a meanie and deserved it. So much for real justice and reform.); and "Patsy" shooting a guy bit never having to even be questioned by police because he's the good guy! Notice the subtle anti-religious dig in which the only guy seen praying is the evil "warden." That's no coincidence, no accident. That sort of negative-association things has been going on ever since the Hays Code was canned in the late '60s and was seen, as you see hear, in the Pre-Code early '30s.Dudley Digges, by the way, is outstanding in his "bad guy" role of "Mr. Thomson." I especially his voice was very effective and could picture him playing one of those similarly-evil roles as an institution boss in a Charles Dickens film adaptation. Cagney played his normal role, the take-no-guff tough guy who gets the pretty girl, "Dorothy Griffith," played by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro also was effective as the leader of the boys, "Jimmy Smith." Just the looks on Darro's face alone made his character believable. Some thing he was the real star of the film, but I'll still go with Cagney. The rest of the reform school kids weren't too believable and they were really ethnic stereotypes, but they were all fun to watch.I thought the most interesting part of the film was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these kids were and witnessed the good and bad and stereotypical parents in the court after the kids were arrested. Those scenes are pure 1930s Dead End Kids stuff. They always showed the kids to be bad news at the beginning of the film, but by the time the story was over they all looked acting more like Wally and Beaver Cleaver - hardly rough "delinquents." It's very far-fetched but it works, entertainment-wise.Overall, a hokey but very entertaining movie, typical of Cagney films and those of the early '30s. Almost all of them rate at least eight stars for their entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Hear It For Dudley!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember - before there was Sidney, there was Dudley.Dudley Digges is barely recalled today - because his heyday as a fixture in sound movies was the late 1920s and through the 1930s. Except for one major performance: the ship's good natured, if tipsy doctor in the 1935 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, most of his films are barely revived. More's the pity because he was a wonderful actor. In 1931 he played Casper Gutman (the original actor to play that villain) opposite Ricardo Cortez's Sam Spade in the first THE MALTESE FALCON. Similarly, about the same time, he played the recording angel in Leslie Howard's version of OUTWARD BOUND - the same role that Sidney Greenstreet tackled in BETWEEN TWO WORLDS a decade later.Digges could be likable and lovable (that ship's doctor again), or detestable (in CHINA SEAS, as the judgmental First Mate sneering at poor Lewis Stone but then proving he's as big a coward in a moment of crisis). He held his own against Paul Robeson in THE EMPEROR JONES. He is the Chinese freedom fighter working with Gary Cooper in THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN. Digges could do anything. Here, he is Mr. Thompson, the hypocritical and thieving warden of a reform school that Frankie Darro and his friends are sent to for committing a robbery and injuring a Greek-American store owner (it is the latest incident for most of them). Digges is as bad here as in CHINA SEAS, but it is a close thing to totally dislike him. He's able to somehow transcend his roles...more later about that.Darro has a gang of urban delinquents (including a Jewish boy and "Farina" from "OUR GANG"). As pointed out in another review, it is a prototype of the Bowery Boys. We see them shake down car owners to pay them to "watch and protect" their autos. When one guy won't do it, they calmly wreck his car. The snatch and grab robbery at the store of the Greek-American is also rather graphically shown - his skull getting fractured when pushed. The boys are rounded up and brought before stern but decent judge Arthur Byron, who realizes that he can't leave the kids with their parents: the parents are unable to watch them, or are incompetent. Unfortunately there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence: a Jewish father who is more concerned with his business than with his son, Farina's stereotype "Yassum" father, and the an Italian father whose willingness to cooperate gets his son out of going to the reform school.Once there the boys find the regime oppressive. Occasionally one of the guards or the nurse (Madge Evans) tries to speak up for them. But Digges has no time for coddling. His is a regime determined to break the boys so they behave themselves. Unfortunately, Digges and his bookkeeper partner are greedy. They have been serving inferior food to the boys and pocketing the profit. One day a new official comes from the state to look at the reform school. It's Jimmy Cagney, who is a hack ward heeler whose gang got the vote out for Edward Maxwell. As a reward (he could not get the Park Commissioner post) Cagney was made an Assistant school inspector. He is supported by his hanger-on pal and factotum Allan Jenkins (in his first Warner Brother film). The irony is that if Digges were a bit more careful, Cagney would probably have let him continue running things. But Cagney arrives to see Darro brought to Digges for fighting. The Warden and Darrow have had problems about respect earlier, and Digges now intends to punish Darro who flees - but get seriously injured by Digges' barbed wire fences and his free use of a whip. Cagney stops Digges and lets Evans treat Darro's injuries. And she explains the reality of the situation to Cagney, and her own idea of real reformatory reform of the boys by building up trust in them with responsibility.The film follows this to the end, showing that Cagney and Evans are on the right path, turning the reformatory as a "republic" for the boys to run properly. This leads to conflict with Digges, whose profiteering is reduced as he is no longer getting supplies. But the scheme is derailed when Cagney himself finds he may be in serious trouble with the law. Digges sees his opportunity and fully takes it. But then he goes too far...far more than he ever bargained for.The 1930s had many films showing kids taking steps to right wrongs and change things. Darro appeared in such as WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD. Cecil B. De Mille did THIS DAY AND AGE, where the kids teach a lesson to a gangster played by Charles Bickford that scares the hell out of him. So it went in the 1930s. THE MAYOR OF HELL reaches a similar intensity of vengeance and juvenile justice seeking. But that's the one problem of the film. Digges' character is a knave and hypocrite, so we never really cheer for him, yet if he wasn't a thief we might go along with his view (even if it is counter-productive). The scenes at the start of Darro and his gang preying on people actually make the harshness Digges would follow seem fairly understandable (even if his thieving ways are not). Also he has one moment when he's justifiably angry at Cagney - at that point in hiding from his own clash with the law - giving orders over a phone from long distance to a befuddled Digges. When Digges learns what's actually happened he is justifiably furious at Cagney lecturing him about proper behavior. It is the closest thing to making Mr. Thompson sympathetic in this fine movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney makes Hell, Swell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first viewing, The Mayor Of Hell seems like a step backwards for Cagney after his successes in films such as The Public Enemy and Taxi, because it feels so low budget.It feels more like a showcase for Frankie Darro than anything else, with Cagney just drafted in to a supporting role to give the movie some box office appeal.Frankie Darro plays Jimmy Smith, the leader of a street gang sent to a reform school for petty crimes. The courtroom scene where he is sentenced, tries to define the characters of these boys by explaining the cause of their delinquent ways, Smith is no good because his dad is no good and so on.In the Reform School, the boy's soon find out that it is the most inappropriately named institution ever, as there is virtually no schooling and even less reform, as the treatment dished out to them is just as bad as the food they are forced to eat, courtesy of cruel Warden Thompson, (Dudley Digges). In fact the only person that seems to care about the welfare of these boys is Nurse Griffiths, (Madge Evans), who is always vocal in her protests regarding the treatment.Enter Deputy Commissioner, Patsy Gargan (Cagney), although he himself is not the paragon of virtue that you would expect of a man in such a position. He is in fact an gangster on the payroll of a mob run political machine. He reluctantly goes to the school on a mandatory fact finding mission, and within minutes of his arrival, Jimmy Smith is bought before the warden, and Gargan witnesses first hand the brutality that the 'inmates' endure. In a vain attempt to escape, Smith leaps at the barbed fence but is yanked down by the guards and is sent to the medical block.It is in the infirmary, that Gargan meets Nurse Griffiths and though the course of their conversation and by seeing some of the other boy's that have had the same brand of 'treatment', he comes to realise that he has in fact come to a torture chamber as opposed to a house of correction.He appeals to his 'superiors' to take over the school full time, although his main motivation at this stage is to gain the affections of Nurse Griffiths. Together they start to instigate some much needed changes, such as better food, no beatings and no guards. The boy's are also instructed to install their own justice system, whereby, the boy's will learn tolerance and reform by governing themselves in their own mock court.The new 'Mayor' of what was formerly known as 'Hell' (hence the movie's title), is Jimmy, to whom Gargan has developed a genuine liking. It is through these new conditions that Jimmy and the other boys start to learn about right and wrong and the first seeds of reform are planted and the boys develop endearing personality traits such as responsibility, adulthood and friendship.Warden Thompson, however, disapproves of the new approach and wants to expose Gargan as a crook. Gargan himself hands him the ammunition, as after heading back to the city to sort out problems with his 'less legal' businesses, he accidentally shoots one of his disloyal goons.Although the shooting was not fatal, Gargan flees for the state line just in case the guy dies and he's wanted for murder. He telephones Warden Thompson, and gives strict instructions that no changes are to be made while he's out of town on 'business', but the resourceful Thompson finds out the real reason why Gargan has fled, and convinced he won't be returning, reverts the school back to the house of horrors it once was, only this time and with revenge in mind, it's twice as bad.Unable to cope with the return of Thompson's harsh regime, Nurse Griffiths resigns and with his last obstacle out the way, Thompson's punishments become more severe, with tragic consequences.After one of the boy's dies of exposure after a spell in 'The Cooler', the other boys, led by Jimmy, revolt and overthrow the guards. They put Thompson on trial for murder in their own courtroom.Nurse Griffiths visits Gargan and explains what has happened to the school in his absence. Fuming with rage, Gargan risks arrest by driving back to the school to stop Thompson once and for all. However, the boy's have done the job for him, as after being found guilty of Murder, Thompson is chased by the frantic mob of delinquents, taking sanctuary on the roof of a barn, the boy's have no second thoughts about setting the barn on fire, forcing Thompson to choose between death by fire or death by falling, it is the latter that transpires, and minutes later Gargan arrives at the school and is determined to stop the boy's from spending the rest of their lives in jail by quashing further unrest. It is only when the boy's realise that Gargan has taken a huge personal risk to save them that he is successful.The conclusion made by the authorities, is that Thompson's death was bought about by his own vicious actions, and nobody else will be made accountable. Gargan is also in the clear as his shooting victim is expected to make a full recovery. Gargan get's his girl, and thrilled at the difference he has made to the boy's lives, he quits the rackets for good and becomes the school's Governor full time.The movie is very entertaining indeed especially considering Cagney is playing 'second banana' to Frankie Darro despite having top billing. Allen Jenkins is great as Cagney's right hand man, although it's a shame he was not given more to do as he could have given the movie some much needed comic relief, although the subject matter may have deemed that slightly inappropriate.Not the best of Cagney's early picture's. but enjoyable nonetheless.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WB sure knew how to make them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one of those social dramas that WB knew how to put together and were guaranteed boxoffice hits in the thirties. This early "dead end kids" are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated. Cagney, a gangster as part of a deal is appointed as the commissioner of the school. He doesn't take it seriously at first but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys. The idea is to let the boys rule and administer their community. Whether this is sound social reform is beyond my belief but it's a movie. It's a lot like Boys Town with a slight darker tone. A useless happy ending deluges what impact the scene prior hard but is still good. WB would later make this same movies with Bogart in the Cagney/fatherly role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mayor of Hell, The (1933) *** (out of 4) James Cagney plays a crime boss who uses his power to get a "real" job working in a boys reformatory school. At first he doesn't take the job too serious but then he sees how the boys are mistreated so he takes over running the school and tries to turn it into something good. This film was remade twice in the next six years with Crime School and Hell's Kitchen and while both of those films were very entertaining there's no question this is the best of the three versions. One thing that helps is the fact that this one was made before the code came into play so it has a lot more of a raw feel to it whereas the remakes were toned down in content. Another added bonus is seeing Cagney who once again delivers a strong performance. He doesn't show up until the twenty-five minute mark and it speaks well of the young actors who hold the film up before the star gets on screen. The supporting players all do fine work with Madge Evans as the love interest, Allen Jenkins as Cagney's sidekick and Dudley Digges as the bad guy running the school. I think one fatal flaw is the ending and the aftermath. The ending turns into a Frankenstein type setting, which might have worked but the aftermath is so rushed and faked that it really ends the film on a sour note. Outside of that this is a pretty good drama with its heart in the right place and the toughness you'd expect from a Warner/Cagney film.</fullReview>

Cagney plays Patsy Gargan, a gang leader himself, who is given a token position as a deputy commissioner. When he finds out first hand of the brutal treatment dished out at the reform school, he is compelled to make some major changes with the help of the reformatory nurse(Madge Evans).

		<fullReview>James Cagney (The Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) was just starting his career and was able to perform as a gangster and also a social worker for a Boys Reform School which is being run by corrupt politicans. The reform school inmates are underpriviledge minors from the streets of New York, like the "East Side Kids" who were poor and uncared for during the great Depression. In the final scenes, there is a trial held by the reform school boys with flaming torches and a barn which is set on fire and a big leap by the corrupt warden. I noticed that they did let the horses out of the barn first. This film is not shown very often and I really can understand WHY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Racketeer James Cagney takes over a reform school that's being run like a prison. With help from pretty nurse Madge Evans, he turns the place around and helps the boys get back on the right track. But the scummy guy that used to run the school is determined to destroy all the good work they've done, no matter what harm it does to the kids.Intense, gritty drama that tackles the issue of juvenile crime and how to deal with it. Strong writing with some good characters. Cagney's excellent in one of his best and probably most underrated films. The kid actors are all terrific and believable. Dudley Digges is a particularly evil villain. Backed up by a typically solid WB stable of supporting actors. Jaw-dropping climax is one of the best finishes to any movie of this decade. Remade as Crime School, with Humphrey Bogart and the Dead End Kids. That one's not bad but it's not nearly as powerful as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reformed Cagney.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Archie Mayo and Michael Curtiz co-directed this effective social drama that stars Jimmy Cagney as reformed juvenile delinquent gangster Patsy Gargan, who, as a result of a political favor, is appointed Deputy Commissioner of the state reformatory for trouble youth, where he discovers that it is run by callous and corrupt Thompson(played by Dudley Diggs). Patsy is determined to initiate reforms to help the kids there(he sympathizes because they remind him of himself) but Thompson fights back, getting Patsy removed from his position, but the inmates refuse to lose the reforms put through, and rebel, forcing Patsy to return to prevent a tragedy... Well-directed and acted film is quite compelling as well, overcoming the melodramatic nature of the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great pre-code WB with a conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie on Turner (thank God for Turner or there'd be nothing to watch!) and really, surprisingly, enjoyed it. I wasn't expecting much, but it's hard to miss with early Cagney and pre-code Warners Brothers.This movie is about a gang of slum kids who are sent to a cruelly run reformatory. There are several ethnic stereotypes - the Jewish father more interested in his business than his kid, the Black father who can barely speak coherently, etc., but I think the movie overcomes the stereotypes with its depictions of the kids' lives in the prison school. I especially liked how the black kid, Farina from the Our Gang comedies, is allowed to be a real person who comforts one of the white kids on their first scary night there, and then is allowed to become a lawyer in the all juvenile run courtroom that Cagney allows them to create. There are many touching scenes here about how the boys relate to each other and develop solidarity and understanding, while facing their common enemy in the evil warden.The movie puts a lot of faith in the socially progressive ideas that Cagney's gangsterish character, and the school's nurse profess. Basically they think that if the kids can recreate an actual society for themselves in the school, complete with all the necessary functions of a political system, police force, court system, store, etc, that they would learn through practical experience how society should function, and be able to learn and apply these lessons directly. I think this idea is actually correct, and it would probably be a good idea in some of our own prisons! Really interesting, enjoyable movie with some excellent performances, notably Frankie Darro as the head delinquent - what a great actor he was, and it's obvious that Cagney saw himself in the kid. Dudley Digges is great as the evil warden, and Cagney...is Cagney, always charming and forceful. Wish they would show this one more often.Pre-Code Warners Brothers....does it get any better!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Tough Guys in One Movie!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankie Darro was a wonderful child actor who excelled at playing pugnacious little toughs with gigantic chips on their shoulders. He appeared in a couple of top films of the early 30s - "The Public Enemy" (1931), a ground breaking crime drama and "Wild Boys of the Road" (1933), a topical depression era movie about kids who ride the rails. He was essentially a younger version of James Cagney. Although short of height, his willingness to do his own stunts kept him employed in a series of programmers when the bigger studios had no more use for him."Crime School" was supposed to be a remake of "The Mayor of Hell" but it had far more humour in it and featured The Dead End Kids and Humphrey Bogart as a very laid back Deputy Commisssioner. "The Mayor of Hell" is really a combination of "Hell's House"/"Crime School"/ "Boy's Town". Even though Cagney didn't make his appearance until around the 25th minute his impact (as usual) was immediate. He plays a hot headed gangster who is on the payroll of a political group run by the mob.Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darro) and his gang (including "Farina" from "Our Gang") run a car washing racket but bite off more than they can chew when they rob a general store and push the owner through a plate glass window. They appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to go to the state reformatory. It is painted in glowing terms - a model school where boys are given a chance to learn a trade. In reality, it is a hellish place run by a sadistic warden, Mr. Thompson (outstandingly played by Dudley Digges). The only compassionate person is Dorothy Griffith, the live-in nurse (played by Madge Evans)."Patsy" Gargan (James Cagney) has been given the job as the new Deputy Commissioner, as a favour. On his arrival at the school he witnesses a failed escape attempt and after talking to Dorothy, realises the school needs sweeping reforms. He is soon running the school and brings in a system of "self government" - rather along the lines of "Boy's Town". Even though Cagney doesn't have a lot to do, the picture is carried along to it's gripping climax by the energy of Darro. After "Patsy" is temporarily out of the picture (he accidentally shoots a mobster and has to leave the state), Thompson returns and his brutal treatment, resulting in the death of a boy ("Skinny") turn the rest of the boys into an angry mob. They burn down a barn and Thompson falls to his death - "Patsy" returning just in time to quieten the mob with some sobering talk.Sure, all the boys seemed to get was a stiff talking to for their crimes but I do disagree with one of the reviewers - Thompson was more than just a "meanie". His sadistic treatment resulted in a boy's death. There is a scene at the beginning where the boys are served some inedible slop - Thompson orders ham and eggs and keeps piling the butter on his bread while talking to Dorothy. Allan Jenkins plays "Uncle" Mike and Sheila Terry, although billed only as "a blonde" has one of the most memorable lines when she pouts and says "I thought there was going to be young boys here, where are they?"!!!Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies should be judged by comparing them to other films of their time. Obviously a film is not going to be the same as films made 70 years later. This film shows a more rugged image of the era than say Boys Town. We do not see the life story of the villain and who really cares, for we have been able to see 4 hours of film to see Darth Vaders life story in the Star Wars series.Enough life stories. This film really represents the hard life of kids during the Depression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes you get to eat the bacon . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . and other times the bacon gets to eat you. That's Warner Bros.' moral of its MAYOR OF HELL story. Government grafter (sorry for using an oxymoron) Reform School Commissioner Thompson initially is the one eating all the decent bacon at Peakstown while the juvenile delinquents incarcerated there are being fed the slop rejected by the fatted pigs (with the taxpayers being billed for caviar, as Thompson himself pockets the difference with the help of his crooked auditor henchman). MAYOR OF HELL is one of the most influential films in American history, as most subsequent public "servants" (including many if not all of the top administrators of the 100 largest U.S. urban school districts) adopted Thompson's "business model." Thompson's personal Principles of Microeconomics have been expanded to include America's taxpayer-funded for-profit Charter School Movement, as they've been applied on a Macroeconomics scale in the head-long rush to "Privatize" ALL government functions. Now that greedy corporations largely owned and run by One Per Center thieves have replaced the cadre of friendly "lunch ladies" of Yesteryear, kids are served the scrapings from the bottom of the lowest bidders' heaps. All the sprawling state psychiatric hospitals of the past are long gone, with their former patients currently being force-fed maggot-infested fare by "private contractors" along side penitentiary gangsters. But MAYOR OF HELL also predicts what Warner thinks the future will look like for the fat cat Thompsons controlling today's America. One night we 99 Per Centers will be pushed too far, as are the boys here, who run Thompson down with flaming torches and literally feed his corpse to the source of all his ill-gotten bacon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney and Madge transform a hellish prison-like reform school into a 'juvenile republic'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please note that this film, which purports to expose common abuses and failings of juvenile reform schools of the times(1933), was released just the year after the damning "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang", staring Paul Muni, the purpose of which was to expose common abuses and failings of US adult justice systems. Both were sponsored by Warners. Whereas Muni thereafter was mostly assigned to portray non-American historical, scientific, literary or political rebels, Cagney and Eddie Robinson mostly specialized in portraying characters relating to American crime, especially gangsters: a popular subject in the '30s.In this film, Cagney is assigned to portray a cocky gangster leader who, quite accidentally, transforms himself into a revolutionary reformer of reform schools. Thus, it's a story about reform taking place simultaneously at 3 levels: the delinquent boys, Cagney(as Patsy) himself, and the basic nature of the reform school. The latter is catalyzed by 3 main factors: 1) Patsy's political corruption-related plum appointment as Deputy Commissioner, which places him over the corrupt and punitive supervisor of the school(Dudley Diggs, as Thompson) 2)Patsy's introductory visit to the school, when he becomes aware of some of the unsavory conditions and policies 3)Patsy's introduction to the reform-advocating school nurse, and his accidental discovery of two of her books: "Fundamental Principles of the Juvenile Republic", and "Self Governing of Juvenile Correction" - radical -sounding titles. Initially, largely to impress Dorothy, whom he soon takes a shine to, he very unexpectedly agrees to try to institute the radical policies advocated by Dorothy. Essentially, the school will be run by the boys, with the superintendent(Thompson) mostly a figurehead, and Patsy and Dorothy present to enforce basic policies and make needed interventions. Among other things, this means the boys will now get decent food, as Thompson cannot siphon off much of the food budget for his own pocket. Patsy and Dorothy essentially hand pick the most incorrigible of the boys: Jimmy Smith(Frankie Darro)as mayor, and his chief rival as the Chief of Police. Court is held for infractions of the rules.This new system seems to be working well, and Dorothy is responding to Patsy's romantic overtures, despite their very different backgrounds. However, Patsy is called away to tend to some gangster 'business', and ends up accidentally shooting a rival, in a tussle. Patsy decides he has to go into hiding until it's determined if his victim will live. This gives Thompson the opportunity too reestablish his old way of running the school, firing the objecting Dorothy, who goes to tell Patsy what is happening. Thompson eventually makes a big mistake in sentencing a boy with a bad cough to a stint in 'the cold room', for not revealing the identity of the other boys involved in a food storage room break-in. The boy dies, presumably of pneumonia, precipitating the whole body of boys into a riot frenzy. They overpower the guards and cut the phone lines, charging the shaking Thompson with murder. Fearing a lynching or lethal beating, he crashes through the window and climbs up on the roof of the school barn, which the boys set ablaze. Thompson has to jump to the ground to avoid being roasted, and dies in the fall. Patsy and Dorothy now arrive, and the aroused boys initially want to beat up Patsy, as being a traitor, until Dorothy is able to explain his situation, and he is accepted back as their new superintendent: a happy ending, after a very scary scene.The film makes the point that there were some relevant people in the justice system and the reform schools, who had the ultimate good of the boys at heart., while others were merely vindictive, exploitive and not interested in trying to reform them, assuming that they were inherently criminal. Historically, this reflected reality, as documented in the book "Abominable Firebug", for example. Since the late 19th century, there had existed 2 basic models for reform schools: 'open' and 'closed'. The school in this film clearly began as an extreme version of the 'closed' type, whereas 'the juvenile republic' model was, in some ways, an extreme version of the 'open. type, which typically dispensed with fences and guards, with the boys spending part of the day in academic studies, and part in vocational training or working at various jobs in or outside of the school.Understandably, the film fails to adequately dramatize the common rivalry among the boys, with the stronger, older, and more aggressive ones tending to abuse(sometimes including sexually) the weaker, younger, and less aggressive ones. Also, as emphasized in the title of the remake: "Crime School", the less incorrigible boys tended to pick up criminal techniques and contacts from the more incorrigible boys.In contrast to many reviewers, I didn't find Frankie Darro, nor any of the other boys, especially charismatic, nor did I find Dudley Diggs exceptional in his thankless role as Thompson. Cagney and Madge Evans(as Dorothy) shine brightly as the stars and heroes. The judicial authorities clearly gave the boys a big break in agreeing that Thompson was guilty of second degree murder, and thus the boy's rioting and vigilante action was justified. Of course, we don't find out how the boys turn out as adults. Despite Patsy's and Dorothy's efforts, Darro's Jimmy still comes across to me as a thuggish adult gangster in-the-making. Social environment isn't everything.The early scene where the parents are defending their son before the judge is interesting. As is historically true, most of the boys were from poor, often immigrant, families, often with no father or a cruel, imprisoned or drunkard father, or were orphans or with foster parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crime School Dirty Faces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Juvenile delinquent Frankie Darro (as James "Jimmy"' Smith) and his street gang are sent to reform school. There, they are abused by sadistic warden Dudley Digges (as Thompson). Deputy commissioner James Cagney (as Richard "Patsy" Gargan) arrives and takes an interest in the boys, since he grew up in the slums and overcame his life as a hoodlum. Mr. Cagney falls in love with nurturing nurse Madge Evans (as Dorothy Griffith). Cagney clashes with Mr. Digges by allowing self-responsibility at the reformatory, and young Mr. Darro is elected "The Mayor of Hell". Undaunted, Digges gets cocky George Offerman Jr. (as Charles "Charlie" Burns) to tempt Darro with sex and freedom, but Cagney smells a rat...Eventually, his former criminal ways get in Cagney's way. A blazing confrontations heats up the deadly climax...This nonsensical, but nonetheless entertaining story became a "Dead End Kids" staple; it was remade as "Crime School" (1938) et al. Cagney's best film of this type is, arguably, "Angels with Dirty Faces" (1938), which seems to receive part of its "Dirty Faces" title herein. The cast above is complimented by Cagney pal and future "Bowery Boys" guest star Allen Jenkins (as "Uncle" Mike). Darro also had several run-ins with various incarnations of the Dead End and East Side Bowery groups. The young toughs are fun, but beware of painful ethnic stereotypes. Strangely, coughing young Raymond Borzage (as Johnny "Skinny" Stone) did not become a star, despite a strong performance here, and his family name.****** The Mayor of Hell (6/23/33) Archie Mayo ~ James Cagney, Frankie Darro, Dudley Digges, George Offerman Jr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of everything in a fine film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film worked for me where the estimable "Boys' Town" failed a few years back; true, it's a brisk-paced, openly manipulative crowd pleaser, but it's lively and gripping, with generous dollops of social comment, romantic comedy, melodrama, prison story, ensemble character work and even gangster action all thrown into the mix. Warner Brothers did have a social conscience, as Hollywood studios went (it didn't extend to their own employees, for example), but they certainly also knew how to play up the exploitation angle for entertainment. Perhaps the film's best moments are at its most cynical - Allen Jenkins shines as the lugubrious 'Uncle' Mike, the hard-bitten sidekick who has to put up with his boss's mercurial gyrations, and it's always entertaining to watch James Cagney go a little too far and get his face slapped by a dame who gives as good as she gets.The child actors are all very good, and nicely differentiated in the vast mix of boys, and there is attention to background detail throughout - not everything is spelt out explicitly in the dialogue, for all the film's efficient hustle. There is a bit of almost everything from heartbreak (the scene with the clinging mother in the courtroom is unexpectedly effective) to horror, with a healthy spice of humour on the side; the studio roster of character actors fills out the single-scene minor roles with talent, and all in all it's a fine film in ninety minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Cagney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie (One of the few Cagney films I never saw (I wish they would show "The Millionaire" or "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" on TCM or release it on DVD)). There is nothing about this film that I did not like: Dudley Diggs, Madge Evans, Allen Jenkins, and of course Cagney, are outstanding. I know there are some people who prefer "Crime School" because of the "Dead End Kids" (Jordan, Gorcey &amp; Hall), and Bogart. But as great as Bogart was, he could not compare to Cagney, and Mr. Thompson had to be one of the most disgusting and cowardly villains you will find in a motion picture (I think of Kent Marlowe (Robert Montgomery) in "The Big House" who accidentally kills someone, and can't stand up and take his punishment like a man)). This would be on my list of the top 10 Cagney films EVER: The others? "Taxi", "The Roaring Twenties", "White Heat", "City For Conquest", "Frisco Kid" (Highly Underrated and better than Robinson's "Barbary Coast", "Pitcher Snatcher", "The Public Enemy", "Angels With Dirty Faces", and my personal favorite "Each Dawn I Die"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible, sure--but it's still dandy entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago, I didn't love and respect the films of Jimmy Cagney nearly as much as I do now. I noticed that many of Cagney's films done with Warner Brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his acting style was far from subtle. However, the more I watched these films, the more I found I was hooked despite these aspects. In fact, I now kind of like and expect them! Fans of old time Hollywood films probably understand what I am saying--teens and other young whippersnappers don't! Well, when it comes to entertainment, THE MAYOR OF HELL never lets up from start to finish. While the idea of a shady character like Cagney played taking over running a reform school is ridiculous, and while all the changes he made also seemed far-fetched, it all somehow worked out and delivered solid entertainment.The gang of tough thugs were pre-Dead End Kids and instead of the likes of Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and Billy Hallop, similar roles are played here by Frankie Darrow and Farina. Yes, I did say "Farina". This Black actor was already famous for his roles in the Our Gang comedies and was, believe it or not, one of the highest paid child actors in Hollywood. All he needed to give up in return was be named an insipid name and act like a nice stereotypical "Negro". Here, he actually was pretty good and the usual Black stereotypes are a bit more subdued than usual. However, some will cringe at the very funny but horribly offensive court scene involving Farina and his dad, Fred 'Snowflake' Toones. With awful names like "Farina" and "Snowflake", don't say I didn't warn you.Apart from this small complaint and a plot that is tough to believe, the film is exceptional and fun. The kids do a great job, as does Cagney and Dudley Digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil warden. Also, as an added plus, you get to see perennial Warner stock actor Allen Jenkins in his first role for the studio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another excellent Cagney movie, although, honestly, he's not the main character in this one. He's an important secondary character, though, and he was top billed. The protagonists of the picture are a bunch of kids from the slums (lead by Frankie Darro, who played Cagney as a child in The Public Enemy). During a petty robbery, one of their victims ends up seriously hurt (or dead, maybe, I don't remember) and they get carted to a reform school, controlled by a nasty warden (Dudley Digges). Madge Evans plays a sympathetic nurse and Cagney is a gangster who has risen up in the realm of politics. Cagney and Evans want to change the awful conditions and empower the kids by creating a sort of government amongst the prisoners (electing Darro "mayor", thus the title). Soon Cagney's gangster past catches up to him and he disappears for a while. At this point, Digges fights back against the kids and makes their existence even more horrible, which leads to a good old fashioned prison riot. It's a social issues movie, kind of in the same genre as the same year's exceptional Wild Boys of the Road (i.e., the pains of being a kid during the Depression), and it's actually rather involving. It helps a lot that Darro and the other kids are fairly good actors, unlike so many child actors of the time. They sure blow the pants off the Dead End Kids, and I'd rank the film a safe distance above the far more famous Angels with Dirty Faces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes movies are made which showcase certain actors. This is one of those movies and the actor who is showcased is Douglas Dumbrille. What a great actor! He proves it beyond any doubt in this movie. He is the epitome of the sinister and corrupt official who will do anything to cover his tracks and protect his turf. What makes his performance so noteworthy is that he does not come off as a caricature. His character is entirely believable which is essential to make the entire movie work. Other noteworthy performances are by Frankie Darro and James Cagney who is the top billed star. The story is an indictment of a reformatory system that brutalizes its charges. The action is fast paced, the dialog snappy, the cinematography outstanding and theme of story, the quest for justice, both compelling and timeless. Although the production is stagy and at times melodramatic, the strength of the story combined with the outstanding acting makes this movie one that should be watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Cagney plays Richard Gargan (nicknamed "Patsy"!), a former gangster now overseeing the surly lads as the new superintendent of a state-run reform school. Tepid genre entry wherein Cagney's the whole show; he dominates the picture, but only because there's not much else of interest going on. Jimmy gives just what's expected from his hard-boiled persona, which can be satisfying if you're in for a quick fix. The direction (by Archie Mayo, though Michael Curtiz was said to have helped) is straightforward without being particularly gripping, although the narrative slips in the second-half, grinding the film down to a messy conclusion (with even Cagney's Patsy getting lost in the shuffle). Remade in 1938 as "Crime School" and again in 1939 as "Hell's Kitchen". ** from ****</fullReview>
