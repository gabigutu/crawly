		<shortDescription>The funniest of Sundance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to musicals, movies like Chicago and Moulin Rouge come to mind. Most people loved one or the other (or both) of those, so Reefer Madness has to work hard to live up to expectations. While it is not as visually extravagant as Moulin Rouge, this movie is just as funny, and while the dances are smaller key than Chicago, they are perfectly choreographed and blend together well. All actors do their own singing and dancing, and they do quite well.The film is about the negative effects of Marijuana on society, in the form of a fable. An all-out, way over the top, in no way politically correct fable. You start suspecting that the writers are not going to hold anything back as soon as Jesus appears in a single silk loincloth, surrounded by showgirls. Very few aspects of the christo-republican lifestyle are not subjected to some good old fashioned irony and black comedy, but democratic values take a bit of beating too.Reefer Madness is based on the stage play of the same title, which was fine-tuned during its 8 year run. The effects of the long tweak-time are obvious, the movie is crammed full of jokes -- from small asides to full-on audience rollers -- and there are virtually no duds. The on-screen adaptation lives up to the material, at no point does this flick feel at all like a stage play.The long practice shows on the performances as well, Kristen Bell and Christian Campbell -- both carrying on their roles from the stage play -- do a great job both as naive 1940's schoolchildren and as uninhabited addicts. A notable change from the play is the addition of Alan Cumming who is putting in a great and unrestrained performance as always.I saw the movie at a Sundance screening at midnight. Not only was the theater totally sold out, but all of the audience members were wide awake and cheering, clapping, laughing and utterly enjoying themselves for the entire duration.In case you get a chance to go to a theater-screening, do it, it deserves the big screen. Otherwise don't forget to program your DVR to record the Showtime premiere! In case it is not obvious from the above, this movie is the definition of A+ fun and entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tonight on show time I watched the pure genius that is Reefer Madness! As musical theatre lover I appreciated the movie right at the beginning when the school play was "Green Grows The Lilacs" which is the play that the musical "Oklahoma" was based on. Not only though was this movie hysterical the whole way through, but the music was incredible and the lyrics and book were outstanding, but on top of it all IT WAS SMART! To take an old movie like Reefer Madness and turn it into a musical and a political satire was pure brilliant! All the performances were outstanding as well, but to me Ana Gyster stole the show! She is just incredible, her voice, her comedic timing, and every little nuance she adds to make that character hers! Christian Campell was also amazing! In fact there was no performance or part of this movie that was wrong...if you're smart and have a good sense of humor you'll LOVE IT! And if I could rate this movie higher than a 10 I would! P.S Rob Torti rocks my world!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The next Rocky Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who get Showtime, watch this show! For those who do not, cozy up to someone who has the channel, promise to bring really yummy munchies, and wheedle an invitation to watch it. This movie - think of it as South Park guys Trey and Parker given free license to create a live musical - exceeded every expectation for an "originals" picture. The songs were lively, the dance numbers way over the top. There were a couple of slow moments early in the movie but they were only there to contrast with the madness to come. This should have been released to theaters, but I suspect that someday it will be. Destined to become a cult classic, this film seems to have been made to become the replacement for the moldy Rocky Horror Picture Show for serial Saturday midnight airings. Get out your fake blood, your garish evening dresses, your tacky lingerie, your devil's horns and your Jesus robes. This movie will be around for a long, long while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reefer Madness should give us all new hope for the return of the movie-musical genre and the sweet days of Rocky Horror-style comedy! I love it when a musical is adapted from stage to screen, and the director takes full advantage of things that can be done in a movie that cannot be realized on stage. Reefer Madness takes full advantage of its film medium while still maintaining an unfailing sense of theatricality. The direction, choreography and vocal performances are fantastic.This awesome movie is flawlessly cast and realized. It's a must-see for any fans of musicals, intelligent comedy and, well, weed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People that didn't like this...just don't like musicals and that's fine. In this day in age where people are so ready to cast musicals off into the film industry abyss, it is great to see something like this come along. If you are turned off by the subject matter you just don't get it. See the original "instructional" short and you will, all too quickly, understand that this movie is right on the money. Big brother government + media fear = America of today and back in the 30's. Just think back to last years terror threat scenarios and you will begin to understand how our government perfers to control by fear and manipulation. Not only is this movie a riot, to me this movie captured the essence of paranoia and "quirkyness" the first one really had. It is well written and combines the best aspects of movies like "Jesus Christ Superstar" and "Little Shop of Horrors", both of which are classics as I'm sure this one is destined to become.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, and brilliantly done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian Campbell is definitely one of America's gems. And the entire cast of this hilarious film should be honored with a statue somewhere. "Reefer Madness" is a pure joy, and in 2005 America it is shockingly TIMELY since we are overrun with moralists of the sort depicted by Alan Cummings in this film.If you enjoy a modern satire, and if you love clever music and great choreographed song numbers, this is the film for you. If you have no sense of humor, watch something else.Steven Weber and Alan Cummings put in great performances. Both are highly underrated actors who have brought magic to many films, and this is no exception. Alan Cummings comes close to stealing the show.But in this film it is Christian Campbell who dazzles the most. He is hilarious almost beyond belief in his moments as the All-American Uber-Wholesome kid. That smile is so perfect and infectious. They could never have found anymore more perfect for this role: someone capable of moving from Mr. Wholesome to Mr. Ruined-by-Marijuana - and his singing and dancing talent came through perfectly in this film. Bravo Christian Campbell!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm SO used to being disappointed by underwritten roles, songs, plot &amp; dialogue, phoned-in performances, etc., in most of what I see in films and T.V. lately... but THIS is SUBLIME! Though it's hilarious and campy, the lyrics are witty and demand intelligence, and the music's terrific, as is every single performance. But there just isn't any actor or aspect of the show to single out as brilliant; every moment of Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical is no less than perfect! My husband, my friends and I haven't been able to stop watching it (it was on Showtime On Demand 'til Saturday), nor can we get the songs out of our heads.... Surely Showtime is going to rerun this on DVD, and (PLEASE!) release it on DVD A.S.A.P. Do yourself a favor and catch it.(And no, I'm in no way affiliated... just a film "buff"!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw Reefer Madness tonight on Showtime and it was fantastic. I thought the score is very relevant to the politics that are going on currently and were right on target. It was interesting to hear the lyrics commenting on the political "spin" that seems to be very relevant to both political parties. Also the targeting "fear" instead of actual problems is very representative of today's political climate.The cast was great too, especially Christian Campbell who is very talented and very good looking as well - he should be in more! I also enjoyed Steven Weber and Alan Cumming who have always been favorites of mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it last night on show-time and i loved it , really good for a show time film.It's very different from your your typical musical,it's closer from Rocky horror picture show than Oklahomma thats for sure. Alan Cumming was perfect as the narrator of the story,his role was mysterious and fun and he did a great job with the part.Ana Gayester was my favorite actress in the film she was just brilliant,and her voice!!!what a voice,bring on the Emmy even if i doubt that a film about marijuana will get one,Ana would deserve it,her comic timing was just perfect and she was very subtle too,I watched the movie twice and had found new things to praise about her acting,really for me she was the star of the show.Kristen Bell was so very cute,I wanted to give her a big hug all trough the movie,she couldn't be more perfect for the part of Mary Jane. One person that nobody commented on yet and for me deserve praise is Robert Torti (Jesus)the part were Jesus sings against marijuana is one of my favorite part of the movie.Making Jesus looks like a cabaret singer was very funny and Robert Torti did it with so much energy and sense of fun that even if his in the movie for that scene only,he leaves a lasting impression. The songs were very good but really only two were stuck on my mind "Mary Jane,Mary Lane" and the "Refeer madness" song. Anyway great movie catch it on show Time,I sure hope that they are planning a DVD release,I'll buy it as soon as it comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vast improvement!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so much better than the 1936 trash-fest that no mere comparison can do it justice. Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical is a smart, funny, and well performed parody of American paranoia, using the original Reefer Madness plot as a launching point to satirize McCarthy, fundamentalism, race, and the obsession with privilege, wealth and 'breeding' which have so sadly marred our history.Unlike the original, nearly everything in this production is done right. The likable characters are the good ones, and the villains are truly despicable. The addition of a decent set of amusing tunes helps to keep the plot moving along (one of the biggest failures of the original film was the inconsistent and often painfully drawn out plot), and the use of some talented Broadway players (Christian Campbell and Kristen Bell are particularly fun to watch) as well as a script guided by rational thought as opposed to ignorance (as was the case in 1936), all make this film unusually entertaining and funny (the author generally dislikes straight comedies and has very high standards for musicals).(Sorry for all the parenthetical statements) Most of you are probably aware of the plot, so I will summarize what distinguishes this from the original rather than simply summarizing the film. This version of Reefer Madness is less a paranoid right-wing attack on marijuana use than an amusing musical which compares the pot-scares that inspired the original film in 1936 to McCarthyism, fundamentalism, racism and various other ethical pathologies America has faced in its history (and today). The film does not promote marijuana use, but does play up the absurdity of the arguments that make it appear to be more harmful than, for example, cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, etc - all of which have been or were, at one time, used by the drug's most vocal enemies.Jimmy Harper, in his voyage from an all-American high school kid to a dope-fiend, meets Satan, Jesus, Joan of Arc, the undead, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt along the way, ending up in a lot of trouble with the law. Spurning his high school sweet heart and terrifying his family, Jimmy sinks deeper and deeper into a pot-crazed state of insatiable lust, violence and - of course - jazz. Finally, this version ends differently from the 1936 film - but I won't give away the conclusion.For me, giving a musical comedy a 7 is some of the highest praise I can give (The Wizard of Oz, Tommy and Singin in the Rain get 9s), so, if you're into this kind of thing, you really should check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most People Won't Understand This Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But I LOVED it. Kristen Bell reprises her role from the off-Broadway show, and is awesome. In fact, the entire cast was awesome. Maybe because I'm a fan of the original 1938 version (Mary Lane getting shot in the back when the gun went off nowhere near that direction was HILARIOUS), but I couldn't help but love the energy this movie had. Most people only know Kristen Bell from Veronica Mars, so it's cool to see her in something totally different. She can dance, and I loved her S&amp;M getup. Christina Campbell is so goofy and looks exactly like his sister Neve, which is fun (even though she's barely in the thing).Ana Gasteyer can SING! People will probably look for some deep meaning, or take this too seriously and over-analyze what it is, but don't--just enjoy the crazy energy and partake in the MADNESS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snide &amp; unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's the point of making a parody of an unintentionally funny movie, at least one as self-evidently specious as Reefer Madness? Not unlike hearing a really bad joke and then being subjected to an endless explanation of its underlying humor, RM: TMM riffs even more exaggeratedly on everything from the 1936 film that's been disproved by advances in science and psychology. However, the real subject of this ugly, unfunny movie is moral revisionism, i.e., pretending that our enlightened age is safe from the prejudices and errant thinking of previous generations. It's quite a snide little film, taking safe jabs at a perceived backward era without adding anything substantive to the mix. This is the height of lazy thinking and broad, liberal pandering, as if a couple of psych-major potheads screened the original film, got all indignant, and decided to decry its factual inaccuracies in musical form. Of course it screened at Sundance and of course it was heralded as a comedy gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just so damn funny and even if you're not the biggest musical fan (I know that I'm not a big fan), you will enjoy those musical numbers/interludes or what you want to call them! It's just so crazy (in a good way), that you can't imagine that something similar to this might have been made in the past ... but the movie connection shows here, that there is indeed a movie from the 30s. And this is a ... "remake" of sorts(?)! (I've got to get my hands on the original movie ... it's got to be great fun ... although it was not intended to be!!)The cast clearly had a blast making this movie and that elevates it even more. The humour is great, the timing is fantastic, only one or two musical numbers do feel out of place (to me) ... but other than that ... GREAT! A real (reefer) MADNESS! ;o) If you like crazy/non-PC movies, than go out (rent) and watch this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i'll admit it. i sat down in front of my TV expecting to see a bit of slightly humorous camp. i was rather pleasantly surprised to find what i did.yes, it's funny, but it also raises some powerful questions. considering it was made in the thirties, i wasn't expecting to see such a modern look at the way a speaker uses fear to influence people. the way Alan Cumming subtly(and not so subtly) divides the group up and brings them back together is masterful.i've always been a big fan of satire, and i say this movie is the next south park movie. its funny and gross and in the end really makes you think.Bravo, Showtime!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cult Classic to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listen, I am in no way shape or form a stoner or have i ever advocated the use of narcotics but, as a musical theatre student and a fan of comedies I can safely say that after watching this film it has moved near the top of my favorite musicals. I started watching the movie leery of the subject matter but after the first song i was hooked. There has been a lot of flack about people complaining that the music is not up to par but from a musical standpoint i must say that it has some of the catchiest tunes I have heard in a musical in a good while. If you are looking for deep moving lyrics listen to Soundheim, if you want something catchy or funny listen to Reefer Madness. It's not merely a parody on the old film but almost a parody of musicals itself with certain lines so intentionally cheesy you can't help but smile (I love Mary Lane...with an L..For Love!). The content is bound to offend certain groups of people and its not for everyone. But if you are like me and come from the Rocky Horror type of crowd check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great music, great satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of musicals and of satire, so of course, this is a hit with me. The music is catchy, well written and memorable. All the performers did a great job, even the ones that I didn't expect would be able to cut it (steven Webber, ana gasthier) did reasonably well. Kristin Bell and Christian Campbell did fantastic, but I think the winner of this musical would have to be Alan Cumming who plays several roles and has a hell of a set of pipes.This film may not be for everyone. If you're uptight, think that one hit of weed will indeed make you nuts or are easily offended when Jesus in a loin cloth sings songs about staying away from Marijuana, this film is not for you.However, if you can have a good laugh both at drug culture and the war on drugs (and perhaps recognize a parallel in what is going on worldwide today), you will enjoy this movie.I wish I could find the soundtrack, but it is not yet released. The original cast recording is impossible to find.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't hurt, either.Personally, I was quite pleased with this campy send-up of the original Thirties propaganda film, mostly because "Reefer Madness: The Musical" goes far beyond mere parody and takes off in directions of its own, much the same way Ashman and Goodman's musical, "Little Shop of Horrors," did back in the mid-Eighties. The music is good, the lyrics are clever, the book is good, production values are high (pun acknowledged), and the acting and singing are without fault. Who could ask for anything more? I haven't had this much fun discovering a new musical since I finally tumbled to "Rent" a few months ago.Original cast members include Kristen "Veronica Mars" Bell, Christian "Yes, I'm Neve's big brother, but I'm talented, too" Campbell, and John "I've done more voice work than you can shake a stick at" Kassir. They acquit themselves with all the flair and talent one would expect from actor/singers who know their stuff inside out. Outstanding support from Alan "Nightcrawler" Cumming, Ana "SNL" Gasteyer, and Steven "Wings" Weber just makes everything even better, along with appearances by Neve "I'm his little sister, you got it" Campbell, OBC alum Robert "The Drew Carey Show" Torti as a wonderfully glitzy Jesus, Stephen E. "I am one daggone busy character actor" Miller, and the luscious Christine "Step by Step" Lakin as a feisty Joan of Arc. Director Andy Fickman, who helmed the horrendous "Who's Your Daddy?" back in 2003 (yes, I actually wasted an hour or so watching it, but at least I got to see Ms. Lakin again), really got the talent required to pull this one off.What's not to like? Stoners being equated with "Night of the Living Dead" zombies, officious establishment types getting their busybody noses tweaked, Jesus getting the Tom Jones treatment, and all within the context of some choice choreography from Mary Ann "Clueless" Kellogg and her able assistants, along with superb art direction, production design, and costuming. Why, just sprinkle on some fine cinematography by Jan "Fright Night" Kiesser and careful editing by Jeff "The Craft" Freeman, and you've got a guaranteed crowd pleaser.Don't Bogart this musical; pass it on to your friends. The only thing I'd really like to know is what the heck is the significance of "420?" Is it just ten times the answer to life, the universe and everything, or is there something more arcane involved? 3.12.08 edit: Now I know. Jeez, you'd think after all this time...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flipping through the channels looking for something to watch I saw the Title "Reefer Madness". The one reason I watched it was because in the information it said "Not recommended, but highly entertaining." I sat down not knowing what it was and found that it was an extremely original and well thought out musical with jokes both in and out of the songs which kept me hooked throughout. Great performances and acting on all parts and as of now I'm waiting till October 2005 for the DVD release so I may show all my friends a truly awesome movie. I didn't realize it was a musical but was already hooked once the first song came on and from there it just got better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard that the play was becoming a movie, I was ecstatic. But what if the distance from the stage to the screen ruins the personal quality of the humor? Not the case. Whether it be when Mary Lane sings that she wants Jimmy to "fill my lonely pew", or when Jesus sings to "trust the man with the stigmata", this movie will leave you pissing your pants. An extremely over-the-top comedy based on the propaganda film of the '30s, this movie tells the story of how smoking marijuana can lead to violent behavior, sexual deviancy, and of course, cannibalism. Also laden with plenty of sexist, racist, and just plain off-color humor, this is one knee-slapper not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So its practically perfect in every way...love the inside jokes (for those of you who don't do theatre or watch old films, you're missing some of the good stuff in here)...but keeping it from a 9 or 10 is the unnecessary gore that pops up outta nowhere in the last quarter of the film...of course, yes, I get that its homaging itself and mocking itself, but still. Its great - especially if you've seen the original or heard/seen the stage version. Krisitin Bell and Alan Cumming are particularly good - but when isn't Veronica Mars clever and when hasn't Nightcrawler been able to sum up the conflict of the hour? Of course, the music is appropriately campy and the lyrics are both amusing and clever. I'm sure someone somewhere is hoping or expecting it to be the next Rocky - seeing Krisitin Bell in the SnM scene was probably as shocking as seeing Susan Surandon in her nightie years ago. The funny thing is - wait for it (!) - I'm afraid it will never catch on with the diligent cult following RHPS has created for itself because while it is formulaic &amp; perfect, the songs are catchy and the directing/choreography is way fun, its ultimately about pot. *shrug* And pot just isn't the same kind of taboo that transvestites and such are. Of course, this pic is in some ways better because it knows who its speaking to and isn't afraid to be self-mocking and self-loathing (Anna's role), and truly, its more fun than any made-for-TV (even if its cable) movie has the right to be. Kudos to the production/writing/directing/music team(s). As a thespian, I can honestly say, Id rather watch this film than some musical drivel still playing on Broadway - and the performances are often more worthy of note. Heres to people making movies that are worth watching and aren't the same old...well, Romeo &amp; Juliet! I honestly think that while I will have to run out and get it as soon as its on DVD (thank god for Movies on Demand!), and I will forever remember the scenes where Jesus is singing with the Vegas angels or cartoon Jimmy is eating his "brownie" (a little on the edge there, my friends!), or the 'perfect'Pleasantville-esque scene in the "5 and dime", I am sorry that we missed out on more Neve Cambpell (and her fab dancing skills) and lost some of the "reefer madness" hype from the opening at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what a movie musical is all about. Superb cast and direction. The editing is excellent. The musical numbers are performed flawlessly. The acting is the right mix of high camp of the thirties style performed by a great cast. I haven't enjoyed a film musical this much since Little Shop Of Horrors. I hope that more musicals (and films in general) of this caliber will be produced. The production values are terrific. The sets and costuming are outstanding. It is by far the best musical to be produced in at least a decade. Some may find it a bit graphic and hokey, but that is part of it's charm. BRAVO!

		<fullReview>In 1965 I was dragged into the equipment room of my high school gym storage room to view the required drug and sex movies. I was actually shown "Refer Madness". I it met the state requirements, In the 70's I saw the same movie in an art house as a classic. Forty years later, I saw the musical. HOW FUN! This is entertainment. If you like what they did with "Little Shop of Horrors", you will love this. You really need to see the original and then view this update. I originally recorded this because I am a big fan of Kristen Bell. I had seen her on "Veronica Bell" and thought she had talent. It's almost on the level of Mony Python's "The Meaning of Life". Why, because the musical scenes are elegant. If you grew up in the age of the musicals, you will like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film Of The Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly loved this movie. It was flipping amazing the music, everything. It will definitely replace the old one as a camp hit, a must see. The best movie yet this year. That Bell girl was amazing, she totally captivates the screen. The way she seems so damn cheerful all the time can really get annoying but you cannot help but love her. And I personally think the sexuality in the film really added to it. When they first made this in the thirties this movie and this drug were the devil, and I am glad that they kept those sentiments true in this remake, all in all if you miss this, you are missing out on a lot. So check it out you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Each time I watch this film, I pick up on more details I had missed on previous viewings. Wildy entertaining, with songs both tuneful and clever, "Reefer Madness" is clearly the finest film on that entire videotape. If you fail to be amused to the point of distraction, if you fail to find yourself humming or even singing those catchy ditties that fill the movie, if you fail to want to watch it over and over again, the fault must surely lie with you rather than the movie. Seek competent psychiatric help and then watch it again, you sad, mad fools!! Because as much as I hate to drop names, I have very important friends upstairs and they said anybody who doesn't enjoy this movie is clearly an enemy of all that is good and decent. Such people, they say (remember, these are not my words, but those of my friends upstairs), should be taken out behind the woodshed and tickled for forty days and forty nights. So unless you are a hell-bound enemy of democracy, I urge you, I implore you, I beg you to watch "Reefer Madness." Over and over, like crimson and clover, like Gibson and Glover. Yes, put down that joint and fire up the cable box. "reefer Madness" is about to air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't get enough of this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best made-for-cable movie I have ever seen! Showtime deserves praise for taking a chance and making a movie of a musical that not many people outside LA and NYC have heard of; judging from the posts I have read, that risk is going to pay off. I wouldn't be surprised if the DVD of the film becomes a top seller for the network. The performances are outstanding; Christian Campbell and Kristen Bell are perfect as the pure but doomed young couple. Both have amazing voices and bring a great deal of joy to their roles. Alan Cumming's performances as the various incarnations of The Lecturer, the Goat Man, and FDR are mesmerizing; he is truly one the most talented performers in the business. Steven Weber as Jack, Ana Gastayer as Mae, and Amy Spanger as Sally do wonderful work in their roles as well as John Kassir, whose maniacal laugh will bring a smile to anyone's face. Robert Torti, as a lounge singer Jesus, gives a stand-out performance and his strong voice will ring in your ears long after his all-too-short musical number is over. My only complaint is that this hasn't been shown on the big screen--yet! I hope the belief that I and others share that this movie will obtain "Rocky Horror Picture Show" status on the midnight movie circuit will prove to be right! Whatever you do, don't miss this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movie Musicals to Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon viewing the original, it is literally a joke on it's self. You can't think of anything more wild, more hilarious, more entertaining...but then comes along Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical.A cast that is as brilliant as Einstein, musical numbers that last in your head for hours upon hours, and jokes that are as great as the actors who speak them.The actors are just right for the parts they portray as Jimmy comes alive on the screen and Mary Lane is so giddy, that she makes everyone around her and in the audience want to vomit, but the thing is, that's the characters point. So the vomit is a good thing.All the other characters bring this story through a hilarious journey that anyone who wants to enjoy funny, political and sexual humor should enjoy. The music is fantastic, I would buy the CD any day, and being the film buff I am, this is definitely in my top 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To REALLY enjoy this movie, one must see "Tell Your Children." Otherwise, this movie/musical will seem as a complete inside joke ... and you're the one person going "What the...?" So please, invest your time into the 30's propaganda film. It's absurd and EXTREMELY drawn out, but it will help you understand where this movie is coming from--not to mention, you will begin to notice tiny similarities between the characters of new and old, which makes it that much more fun to watch ...However, if you choose NOT to watch "Tell Your Children," this movie can be just as fun to watch if--now listen carefully--YOU KEEP AN OPEN MIND. The title has the word "reefer" in it, so don't expect an epic or a film noir. All it is asking you to do is sit back and enjoy the drug-induced, paranoid, munchy-ridden ride. *Spectacular performances by Christian Campbell and John Kassir.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Reefer Madness" was such an awesome movie. Not as insightful and enlightening as plain fun this movie is to watch. Personally, I was stoned when I watched this movie which added irony, which added extra laughs. So fun to watch them sing as well. It is extremely entertaining, I think to hear lines such as "Reefer has blown out her mind!" sung victoriously. The movie is also a change. It is different from other movies in that it is basically a play. This movie looks like a play-like one you'd go see on Broadway. I recommend it to anyone looking for laughs, and a change instead of watching the same types of movies over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This satirical adaptation of the infamous 1936 movie hits all the right notes. While taking a wacky, over-the-top approach to the overly serious position taken by the original, "Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical" does make sure to note the racism inherent in the drug war (the Lecturer claims that jazz is rooted in marijuana usage, and that it tricks white women into wanting sex with black men). Of course, one can simply laugh at the zaniness, as a wholesome, all-American boy gets addicted after only one puff, while his bubbly girlfriend worries about him. This is one movie that's sure to make social and religious conservatives apoplectic.And the cast. Alan Cumming is an all-around provocateur, so this is the perfect role for him. Kristen Bell has become a recognizable name in the past few years. Christian Campbell I don't know, but Neve Campbell is best known for the "Scream" franchise. Ana Gasteyer is a former SNL cast member. Steven Weber has played some assorted roles. John Kassir is best known as the voice of the Crypt Keeper on "Tales from the Crypt".All in all, a really enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't consider this as "The Next Rocky Horror film" or "Genius", I consider this a headache because it was pretty much all over the place! I'm just so disappointed as I love musicals and of course, Alan Cumming &amp; Kirsten Bell were involved in this. I felt the story line didn't make much sense, like one story is jumped onto another at the same time. I just had to stop watching the movie after seeing it only for 30 minutes. I so want my minutes back man! The songs didn't even have great lyrics in them except I loved the song "Reefer Madness" but the rest, god no they had made no sense! I hated the way they made Kirsten Bell's character act very annoying and I absolutely hated the costumes they gave her! The clothes were just as hideous as Christian Campbell's character with his stupid bow-tie and a sweater! I honestly couldn't say anything more about this movie but I can say, it was a waste of time watching it with horror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, I'm not crazy; Reefer Madness is one of my favorite musicals! It's up in smoke fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While, personally I don't smoke the stuff, I found this movie to be very entertaining. Reefer Madness is not only one of my favorite musicals, but one of the most unheard gens in musical theater. The 2005 made-for-television Showtime musical comedy film directed Andy Fickman was an adaptation of the Off-Broadway musical of the same name based on the 1936 exploitation film also of the same name. The 1930s crusade against marijuana, with the Hollywood Hays Code and prejudice directed at racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, labor unions, gays and lesbians is just awfully stupid, so I was glad to hear a movie playing fun of it. With an all-star cast, this satire movie brings some of the best songs I have ever heard in any musical while making fun of the paranoid over-reaction and over-politicizing of the original Tell the Truth program. The production quality is great. The set actually looks decent for a TV movie. The comedy is objectively funny as well, and the 30's were quite ridiculously white-bread about legality equal morality. In a high school classroom, there is a Tell the Truth meeting going on in a black and white color scheme. The Lecturer (Alan Cumming) tells the assembly of anxious parents about the evils of marijuana. It's here, we get to hear the opening song, Reefer Madness theme song by the Steven Colbert look alike. Alan Cumming's voice is awesome! So deliciously creepy! The movie then opens in color showing a young man, Jimmy Harper (Christian Campbell) a fine upstanding youth, blessed with his love for his girlfriend Mary Lane (Kristen Bell). Both actors reprise their roles from the stage as they continue to be charming, and cute. Jimmy's got some crazy ass pipes in his lung in his singing. Kristen is an amazing singer and she can really dance. The two are so in love, they quote and sing 'Romeo and Juliet', not really knowing the ending to that story. The word play in the Romeo and Juliet song is very witty, and watching Shakespeare shaking his head was just hilarious. However, across town, the sadistic weed-pusher, Jack Stone (Steven Weber), and his cronies, neurotic whore Sally DeBanis (Amy Spanger), moll Mae Coleman (Ana Gasteyer), former college student Ralph Wiley (John Kassir), are living in the depths of depravity looking for their next victim. Steven Weber plays the over the top gangster, while Ana Gasteyers gives one hell of a performance singing the song 'The Stuff'. The stuff is a great song by Ana. She plays it over the top as well as straight. Did you know the guy who plays Ralph is the voice of The Cryptkeeper in Tales of the Crypts? John Kassir also worked on the stage version. Anyways, the drug pushers meet Jimmy at the local soda counter during the 'Down at the Ol' Five and Dime' musical number. I really don't like this song, but the dancing is great. Nothing to say about this, but a small cameo by Neve Campbell as Miss Poppy, despite getting third billing. Here's an explanation for Neve Campbell: Originally she was supposed to play Mary Jane in this film adaption but that would have been very weird what with her brother playing Jimmy, so she got recast as Miss Poppy. Also she had a little more character development in the original show as someone who was secretly working for Jack and helped him find kids to push reefer on. Here, she's just a three minute character. So John Carradine like movie. Jimmy get hook on the stuff after one hit taking him to the 'Orgy' song number. Once again, not a good song, but good dance number. I love Jimmy's face after he takes a hit. It made me laugh. So if I take a toke, I will be whisked away to a island of orgy loving barely clad men and women who smoke weed and worship a goat-demon deity named Moloch. Seems legit. The next two songs 'Lonely Pew' and "Listen to Jesus, Jimmy' are amazing. Robert Torti, who played both Jack and Jesus on-stage, portrays only the latter in the film version. I don't find this to really be sacrilegious. I mean, it's not a demeaning portrayal of Jesus; if anything, it just makes him look more awesome. And I would also like to believe that Jesus would kid around a little bit, because God obviously has a sense of humor. 'Lonely Pew' was an add song. Not in the original show. Jimmy continue to fall into madness, getting frame for murder. Only stopping to question himself with 'Mary Jane/Mary Lane'. This song is the best in the movie. Jimmy eats the brownie and immediately forgets all about Mary ("The Brownie Song"). This song is awful, but at less it's short. It's replace a song just known as the monkey song. I would have just cut both songs from the movie. Not only does Jimmy get into a mess, but Mary who plan to rescue him, but instead get hook during the 'Little Mary Sunshine' number. Mary transforms from your simple high school sweetheart into a sadistic, whip cracking dominatrix. The movie go all Macbeth with the 'Murder' number and end with semi tragedy. Overall, this was incredibly entertaining! I was choking on laughter all the way through! I could hardly breathe, it was so hysterical! My only complaint is that still the drug trade does in fact destroy lives, and the movie does make light of it. I fully acknowledge that Marijuana is just as bad as alcohol as far as addiction and incapacitation, but this movie doesn't give you a right to dumb yourself down by Mary Jane. But this is not a debate that doesn't needs not happen here, so just enjoy the movie for its silliness. Can Jimmy get out of the murder rap and save Mary from Reefer Madness? You just have to watch to find out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reefer Madness is fun, quirky, clever and exciting. A perfect spoof of the original Reefer Madness (also known as 'Tell Your Children').The cast is a breath of fresh air, with Christian Campbell and Kristen Bell playing the high-school sweethearts soon to fall victim to 'reefer madness', Alan Cumming as the lecturer against the evils of the reefer (the narrator) and several other characters, and Neve Campbell playing the proprietor of the Soda shop.Even more so than in the TV show Veronica Mars, Kristen Bell is simply adorable. Whether she is playing an angelic do-gooder, a dominatrix, or a teenage PI, you simply can not go past the star dust emanating from Kristen Bell. She has amazing vocal strength and uses it perfectly in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply this movie is spellbinding. From the opening bars of 'Reefer Madness' to the closing notes of 'Tell 'em The Truth' You will be enthralled. Taking a drug-propaganda film that was allegedly made by the government and turning it into a comedy-musical isn't an easy task but the writers managed to pull it off. The cast is superb, embracing the very over-the-top 30's style acting that the original movie had and playing it to the hilt. And they can sing us a storm. But quite possibly the musical highlight of the film is when Ana Gasteyer performs 'The Stuff' with as much emotion and sensuality as she can muster. This movie will definitely be remembered for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical (as if the title needed it) is a..um...spoof, some would say, of the original movie from 1936 entitled "Tell Your Children". As the title would suggest, it's changed into the form of a musical. Fun. The film has many has many, many dance scenes and musical numbers to keep anyone who knows what the Tony Awards entertained. Some people (you know who you are) might not enjoy it because of all the dancing and skipping and singing and "sissy boy" things. Well, who cares? Go watch Monday night football.This will also attract the "stoner" crowd, obviously. Well, that's good. It won't change there minds.The film is fun, has loads of personality, and well written. Alan Cumming is very enjoyable with all his roles. I never knew he was such a great actor (Nightcrawler in X-Men 2 wasn't exactly his best). The only person to do a better job is Kristen Bell, who is a phenomenal singer and actress. Why she hasn't done a Broadway production is beyond me. I hope to see her in more films one day. I guess if I had a quarrel with this movie anywhere, it would be it's length, which might bore you if you are alone. So, have fun, watch with a friend, laugh, dance a little, and don't smoke the "evil" marijuana. Ha. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reefer Madness...the Movie Musical.What a treat. FUnny all the way around, and not just slapstick funny, but a ton of well thought out satire sprinkled all over it like crushed seeds on a brownie. Poor Jimmie and Sally. If only they had been taught about the Devil's weed, the tragic events of this biopic could have been avoided. Things seemed so swell at the 5 and Dime until that rat-fink Jack showed up with his fancy suit and swing dance moves that he probably learned from one of those Jazz clubs...Everyone in this marvelous production was perfect. Alan Cumming was the narrator/devil/agency man who warned the unknowing parents of the town about the dangers facing their young upstanding American children. Christian Campbell reprises his role from the Broadway production as Jimmie (a role he says he might be playing till he is 50) and his lovely sister Neve makes an appearance as Poppy the malt shoppe gal. Ana Gastyer lends her incredible voice and great skill in over the top acting as Mae, the hemp-house harlot with a heart of gold. The entire scope is the movie is fast furious and funny. The sets are a character in and of themselves with found jokes everywhere, like the town's population being 420 or the school being named after Harry J Anslinger (look it up people). The costumes are (insert Nathan Lane voice here) Faaabulous. And the dialog will have you in stitches, especially when you realize that most of it is from the original propaganda film, "Button your lip. You've got more static than a radio." and by the way, they've included the 1936 classic on the DVD.So run right out and grab it, toke up on your "muggles",or your t-sticks or whatever antiquated term you wish, and laugh your fool head off. Just be mindful that you don't succumb to (yes, I'm actually doing this) ReefeR MaaaadnessSS....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To call it the funniest film of 2005 may be high praise, but believe me when I tell you it is well earned. Kudos to the creative team behind this effort for a job done not only well, but just about as perfectly as one could hope. The cast is uniformly outstanding, not a bad or even merely acceptable performance in the bunch - just outstanding! Production values on this made for cable flick put many higher budgeted theatrical releases to shame. You don't have to be a fan of musicals to enjoy this outrageous send up of the 1930's exploitation classic, you just have to have a sense of humor and an appreciation of broad social satire. One would have to be a pretty damn uptight right winger not to enjoy this film...Somehow I can't help feeling that even old G.W. Bush himself would get a giggle out of it - in secret, of course. Yep, it's THAT good! Shame they didn't release it theatrically first, as despite our current political climate (Or perhaps BECAUSE of it) this puppy would have been the sleeper hit of the Summer for sure! Again...It is THAT GOOD!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical" has got to be one of the classic satires of all times ... IF, that is, you are familiar with the history of the drug war and/or the original not-supposed-to-be-funny 1938 propaganda film on which this movie is based (included on the DVD).Like "Galaxy Quest," the more you know about the cultural references, the funnier it is. I particularly liked the way said references were subtly inserted, rather than "bang-you-on-the-head" obvious. If you watch the commentary on the DVD, many of these references get pointed out.The song lyrics are hilarious, and have an insidious way of getting stuck in your head for days. The actors strike the perfect balance between too serious and too slapstick (think "Dodgeball" or "The Brady Bunch Movie"). Costumes, sets, and lighting are fabulous enough to appease even the snobbiest of film critics.In short, I ordered not one, not two, but THREE copies of the DVD to be sent out as Christmas gifts, as well as a copy for myself. Now, if they'd only release the movie soundtrack!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bonafide "hit"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited about this movie when I first heard about it. I had seen the original 1938 movie and though ti was funny. I'd heard of the musical years before, but I never heard any of the songs. Then I went to Showtime's website for the movie and heard some of the sound clips. It made me want to see this movie even more. It had a great script. I love the way they took a cheesy propaganda film and made it into a musical that actually has something to say. Granted, it is till cheesy and played for laughs, but it really gives an insight to the way things were back int he 1930's. When everyone was afraid that everyone else was a communist. The music in the movie is far superior to that of some of the shows on Broadway right now. After I saw the movie I had to get the Original LA Cast Recording. Boy are they different. Act One is almost identical, but Act 2 only shares like 2 songs with the original. I was a little disappointed in that. I was really hoping to have a soundtrack with all this wonderful music. I hear they are NOT putting out a Movie Soundtrack because of costs. That makes me a little upset. There are some great songs in the movie that are not on any soundtrack ("Murder" and "Mary Jane/Mary Lane.") I really hope they reconsider this. I now quite a few people that would buy the CD. I have turned them onto the movie. Now as for the movie itself. It is GREAT. The actors from the original Off-Broadway production are awesome in the roles they created. Steven Webber is a great addition to the Cast. And I must admit that i am in love with Anna Gasteyer. I LOVE her voice. She really hits a great note in "The Stuff." She plays the role with honesty. That makes it ever so much better. If they played the roles like prat falling fools, the movie could have really sucked. Luckily, the director knew what to do. I commend him for that. Christian Campbell is also very good as Jimmy. He's got a great singing voice and he actually pulls of playing a 16 year old kid. It's great. Kristen Bell is the perfect Mary Lane. She's got the naivet down pat. My favorite role in the movie has to be Sally as played by Amy Spanger. She's the prefect dumb blonde. My favorite line of her's is when Mary gets shot and she falls to the ground. Sally points to her and nonchalantly says "She fell down!" It's great. If you ever get the chance to see this movie I highly recommend it. Let's just hope it comes out on DVD soon. i really want to watch it over and over again!! And PLEASE PUT OUT A CD!!!!</fullReview>

Everything came out just like i was hoping, i watch this movie over eight times and actually i will be watching it again once i am done with my review. *laughs* well i hope that everyone will pick up this film because it is a great movie... i suggest making sure young children are not Present.&lt;333 Alisha "The Butch"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Musical Madness with over-acting, cheesy dialogue and great musical numbers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POTENTIAL SPOILERS.Having never seen the original, I didn't know what to expect except for a wacky and silly plot. The movie is definitely wacky and probably won't suit many peoples' tastes unless of course you are a fan of zombies, blood, gore, murders, pot, highly choreographed dance scenes, tragic love stories and funny songs. Being the world's biggest musical fan, I have to say the music isn't half bad. Better than I expected. Of course its silly, but I think that's what the movie is trying to show: that people going crazy over the use of pot is silly! Alan Cumming was BRILLIANT. The songs were hysterical. And I would recommend this to musical fans or those who like grade-B horror flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original show at The Roxie in Los Angeles and never laughed so hard at I was seeing on stage. The movie manages to capture the spirit of the show, and go beyond with wackiness. At first the film seemed a bit over the top, but after "The Pot Orgy", the movie had me hooked. Even upon repeat viewings the film is still fun and has genuine laughs.The true standout is Ana Gasteyer as Mae. She had the perfect level of camp and absolute laughs and should earn an Emmy nomination for her outstanding role. Alan Cumming also proves how indespensably talented he is as The Lecturer, a slimy government representative who uses fear and propaganda to get an agenda across (sound familiar?).The film is a wacky wild parody but during the final 6 minutes of the film, it shows its true form as a satire on recent events in this world and how they were handled by the media and our own government. A sly slip in that was just veiled in the stage show. This movie will not disappoint at all...all around entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has not been a musical this great since the Rocky Horror Picture show.The singing is absolutely astounding. I don't usually buy soundtracks, but if this one ever comes out, I'll be first in line.This is a tongue in cheek movie which is irreverent about just about everything. (Although I actually found a muscular "Tom Jones" version of Jesus somehow comforting.) There hasn't been a more effective use of Zombies since Michael Jackson's Thriller.If your only experience with Kristin Bell is the star of Veronica Mars, you are in for a pleasant surprise. Her Mary Lane is the most squeaky clean human imaginable. Yet, under the influence of "Mary Jane" she is very, very naughty. What the 2 sides of her character have in common is an astonishing voice.If your only experience with John Kassar is the voice of the Cryptkeeper in Tales from the Crypt, you will find him just as creepy in reel life.I would never have thought it possible to make an entertaining movie based on the 1936 "shockumentary" "Reefer Madness" My only reservation is that the movie shouldn't be watched by children. The blood flows freely. This is really too bad because I'm sure that kids will enjoy the songs.Like I said, I'll be first in line for the soundtrack, but I'll be re-watching the movie a few more times while I'm waiting.If you find some of the footage disturbing, close your eyes and listen to the music. However, make sure that you reopen them for the dance sequences. Neve Campbell and Steven Weber are terrific and you haven't seen this type of dancing in a long time.If you give the movie a chance, you'll come back to it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow.This makes Rocky Horror look like Cannibal: The Musical. And its ten times better then Phantom of the Opera. Seriously the only movie musical that even comes close is Moulin Rouge.This is one of the best movies ever. The camp value of this is just right. There's enough for it to be over the top and entertaining while it does not strive to take itself far too seriously and, refreshingly, no attempts are made at verisimilitude.The soundtrack is filled with some instant classics like "Lonely Pew," "Listen to Jesus Jimmy" and the title track "Reefer Madness."The acting in the film is top notch. Everyone is cast perfectly and the 30 year old Christian Campbell even works as a high schooler in a film this over the top. Amy Spanger was impressive (and I still can't believe that she's MARRIED to Michael C. Hall) and I had never seen her in a film before. Kristen Bell has superstar written all over her thanks to this film, a short stint on Deadwood and a hit TV series.And it has Alan Cumming, what more needs to be said?This was the perfect movie to come out at the perfect time (a time of strong armed moralizing with little actual factual backing), though unfortunately a lot of the people who would learn the most from the film are the type that the subversive camp would be totally lost on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen many good movies and TV shows this year, found many astonishing Episodes and movies and didn't think it can get better. But in the last week of this year, I learned better. Not only a parody of "Tell your children" but also a professional made musical itself. The actors are the widely the original cast from the New York musical version and you can see it in their dancing, their performance and their singing. When you don't find a musical that suits you, because you find them dull or boring, "Reefer Madness" can be the one you'll like. It's funny, exciting and doesn't bore you if you look it several times in short time. If you like musicals, you get one, if you like parodies, you'll love it, if you want a comedy, you must see it, do you want gore, watch it to the end. Creative and amazing, don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reefer Madness surprised and shocked me. Come to find out there are some great actors in the Showtime edition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to musicals I usually don't enjoy them too much. However it seems to me that the cast they assembled for this remake was quite star studded, which usually means a clash of ego's. This however was not the case. John Kassir aka"The Crypt Keeper," was the sleeper in this one. He was absolutely flawless in his portrayal of Ralph, a reefer addicted lunatic. Next I'd say that Kristen Bell was the other sleeper of this movie and quite the bombshell. She was perfect to play Mary Lane and good lord almighty the girl can sing and dance. That is what surprised me about this up and coming actress. Ana Gasteyer was also a pleasant surprise as Mae, she can sing, dance and still deliver a perfect punchline. Steven Weber post "Wings," days has really done some great things since leaving that show and now he's had the fortunate chance to land the role of Jack, a reefer salesman with no conscience. Anyhow, I could go on about this remake of the 1936 original, but it would really do it no justice. If you want to be entertained and laugh I would suggest checking this movie out. I enjoyed it thoroughly and think most people would as well.</fullReview>

There were so many things in it that so many people would enjoy seeing that I don't understand why so many people didn't like it.Another reason why I liked this movie sooo much is because you didn't EXACTLY know what was gunna happen at the end...unless you read it somewhere or something. But if you were like me and you were just flippin through the channels and started watching it, you wouldn't expect for Mary Lane to die or Jack or Sally or even Ralph.And this movie isn't just for druggies or whatever...I don't do drugs and I loved it.So I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun romp with hilarious jokes and really good music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think in order for me to be in on the joke though, I should have seen the original Reefer Madness before diving straight into this musical parody. I hope with this and the Plan 9 remake that making mockeries or remakes of bad movies becomes a thing. Either way this is a really good comedic musical whether you've seen the original or not, all you need is a basic knowledge of why Reefer Madness still is made fun of today and you'll still laugh at it.The plot is that in the 1930's a local school holds a function for the adults of the community called "Tell Your Children" where the presenter (Alan Cumming) tells them of a drug menace which one single use would transform the child forever into maniacal sociopathic murderers and when they calm down they will stop at nothing to get their next fix... Marijuana. He tells of a story via film of how marijuana destroyed 2 lives beyond repair.The music is great in this movie. Usually one thing that happens with a comedic musical is that the jokes in the song are purely visual, meaning taken out of context the songs are serious or the jokes are usually in the dialogue, making the music just 3 minute breaks from something funny. At least that's in my experience. This is the first I've seen which actually has funny music in it. There's an entire song and dance number done by Jesus himself pressuring the lead into not using marijuana. Although my favourite song in the movie doesn't have that many jokes in it (Mary Jane/Mary Lane) the music alone is worth seeing the movie for. Even if it's for that song with zombies in it.Basically all I do have to say about the movie is that I did find the jokes hilarious and the music is pretty damn good. The acting is good in the sense that it's over-the-top and everything else just sets the mood for the 1930's that people wanted to see of the over the top outright sickening portrayal of it.At the end of the day, if you want a joking knock to a bad movie then I can't recommend this movie more, even if you haven't seen the original. It just ends up being a lot of fun at the end of the day and a really big knock to conservative propaganda. If any of this sounds like your thing then see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Got the Munchies for Reefer Madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American musicals have taken a bit of a beating as of late. While I haven't seen any musical releases this year thus far, I saw two, highly advertised ones last year. The absolutely dreadful Rock of Ages (2012) and the Les Miserables (2012). Even if you disagree with my assessment of these two films, even if you think they aren't abhorrent wastes of time and patience, you have to admit no modern musical since Chicago (2002) has had exciting dance sequences that harken back to the best of MGM.That is unless you include the Showtime made-for-TV movie Reefer Madness (2004) which I do. For while Les Miserables contained elaborate sets (most of which you couldn't see due to all the f***ing close-ups) and Rock of Ages contained big name stars, Reefer Madness contained sixteen complex musical numbers complete with masterful choreography and an infectious sense of humor. Oh, and it's about pot.Reefer Madness follows the story of Jimmy Harper (Christian Campbell), a strapping young lad of some sixteen summers. He falls for a girl by the name of Mary Lane (Kristen Bell) but also falls into the clutches of scurrilous drug dealer Jack (Steven Weber), his weak-willed girlfriend Mae (Ana Gasteyer) and their fellow pot groupies (Amy Spanger and John Kassir). Can true love carry the day and save Jimmy from the evil influences of marijuana? Or will the devil weed take him and his you love with him.The musical is based on a 1936 propaganda film of the same name. When it was released it was a tale of caution against the dangers of marijuana. When it resurfaced in the 60's, 70's and beyond, Reefer Madness became a cult classic largely because of its cheesy, over-the-top story and its egregious misrepresentation of pot and its dangers.Now I don't personally smoke the stagger leaf myself. I see no point in smoking something that will distort the way I see the world for a few hours. That's what I have movies for. But with statistics being thrown out like, "four out of five cases of violent crimes are committed by dope slaves," and "marijuana has an addictive power beyond that of cocaine and heroin," you can't help but giggle at the after school special gone awry. Even Thelma White, the actress who played the original Mae was tickled by the movies original screenplay. She would later live to see Reefer Madness become an off-Broadway musical and was invited by the creators to opening night.Released by Showtime Networks on DVD, Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical has become somewhat of a cult favorite in its own right even if it didn't make it to the big screen. For just like the 1986 update on the 1960 Roger Corman original Little Shop of Horrors, Reefer Madness updates the material inserting an acerbic yet eager sense of humor and musical numbers. And boy is it a sight to see.Credit must be given to veteran TV scribes Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney (Who also wrote the original musical). Their penchant for quality small screen scrawling and collaboration created a movie that jumps off the screen. Veteran TV actors Ana Gasteyer of Saturday Night Live (1975- Present) fame, Kristen Bell of Veronica Mars (2004-2007) fame, Steven Weber of Wings (1990-1997) fame and Christian Campbell of...I want to say The 4400 (2004-2007) fame, all make valiant and worthwhile efforts in their respective parts. John Kassir, who played the voice of the Crypt Keeper in pervasive horror series Tales From the Crypt (1989-1996) takes home the prize for most hilariously over-the-top performance as Ralph, the pot-addled college boy.How deliciously absurd is Reefer Madness? Even the DVD case smells of chocolate. Watch it because you must. Then watch it again because you want to. It's the Rocky Horror (1975) of the Bush years. The Little Shop of Horrors of premium cable and even if you watch Reefer Madness and don't think it's all that and a dime bag of weed, it's still has more to offer stylistically than something as trite as Rock of Ages.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but the original is so much more enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a bit of a complaint about this and many other movies. When I got the DVD, I noticed there were no captions of any sort--and it sure would have helped since several in my household are hard of hearing. In addition, I am sure that a lot of fans of musicals would have loved to have been able to see the words and perhaps even sing along.As for the film, "Reefer Madness: The Musical" is based, very loosely, on the original film "Reefer Madness (1936--also called "Tell Your Children"). It is a musical parody of the original--which is a bit of a problem since the original film was a comedy--though perhaps unintentionally. It's known by bad movie fans as one of the most enjoyably bad movies of the era. And, I must confess, while I liked this musical, I still would much prefer to watch the original--it is truly hilarious (though the studio's other offering, "Sex Madness", is actually even funnier).Now if you do watch this film, be prepared to be offended. I am not talking about how it trivializes pot use but the scenes of Jesus dancing about with Satan in one song as well as the sexual nature of the film. It is NOT a film for small children or mother-in-laws! If you can look past this and decide to watch the film, be sure to watch Alan Cumming--who is absolutely awesome in the movie. I love how he made his British accent completely disappear--putting on a rugged voice and singing with a range I never thought he was capable of doing. Wow...what a voice. Also, possessing another wonderful voice is Christian Campbell--who has a knack for picking strange and edgy roles (his most icky and cool was "Pretty Dead Girl"--a definite must-see). And it didn't hurt that the songs were so gosh-darn cute.By the way, didn't Christian Campbell remind you of the pug from the end of "Best In Show"? If you are not sure, see him at the 60 minute mark and you'll see what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>racist? the worst movie of all time? it was a satire on racism so how can it be racist? and don't people from "the worst ever" club get tired of that same old hyperbolic line? anyone that thinks this is the worst musical has never sat through the musical remakes of 'Lost Horizon'or 'Mame'. now those, those were terrible.this is a hard movie to get. most people automatically assume that it advocates drug use when actually it really doesn't. in reality it's somewhat critical of drug usage and addiction. remember the line, "i'm not addicted no. i just enjoy the glow"? this movie makes fun of marijuana addiction just like it pokes fun and skewers about everything American society is about. it doesn't promote marijuana use, it's a film that is more about being against prohibition. even though it's critical of addiction it is far more critical of the bigger concern of prohibition. something that never works and brings down society. this film really wants to make sure prohibition never happens again. not get your kids high on pot.there are so many statements and insights here it would be impossible to do them justice in a short review. this is something that needs to be reviewed in 'Film Quarterly' and analyzed at great length.it is also funny to note that although this was made for television, it really, in my opinion, is one of the very best musical comedies ever (excuse the hyperbole)put on film. i'm no stranger to musicals either, in fact i love them. i've seen everything from Busby Berkley and Gershwin, to Rodgers and Hammerstein and Lerner and Lowe, to the recent musicals of Lloyd Webber and others. i have so many musicals coming out of my brain which is why this is such a breath of fresh air. everything about it, starting with it's subject matter, is so original. even the fact that it has a conventional sounding musical score, makes it unconventional.usually it's Disney that has done so well with television musicals that it's nice to see someone else excel with it. in this case, 'Weeds' home channel Showtime.the whole production is very handsomely done for a relatively low budget. the humor, script and songs are racy and hilarious. but i think some extra applause is due to the amazing cast from Cummings and Bell to the wonderful Ana Gasteyer. the cast was simply made in Heaven.you really should always watch this in a double bill with the original 1936 propaganda film to get the full effect of how funny this is. i suggest the 20th century fox DVD which includes both the black &amp; white and a incredibly colored colorized version. usually i hate colorized films but they did such a good job with this one with different people blowing out different colors of smoke to create a wild psychedelic effect.the original propaganda film was made to scare youth away from drugs. this musical remake is funny and feel good, but so challenging, that it still might have a scary and unnerving effect for a lot of uptight young people.if you choose to partake in this film challenge, remember, that one puff will plunge you into a hilariously high web of murder, sex, lunacy, and jazz music. oh yeah. and hit and run driving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy, catchy: the next best over-the-top musical after "Rocky Horror"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrific, campy movie musicals don't come around very often. How many films have been able to emulate the success of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show?" How many have even tried? "Reefer Madness" is about the closest any film has come to capturing the bizarre spirit of that cult classic. A film version of the Off-Broadway production, "Reefer" is the outrageous musical version of the old public education film warning parents of the "effects" of marijuana on impressionable teenagers. Only such a ridiculous blunder in our country's drug-ed history could warrant such a ridiculous musical and Showtime fits it with the trappings of a cult favorite.What makes "Reefer" and other campy musicals work is the undercurrent of pure talent in the film. This is not a "so bad it's good" movie; there's actual intelligence in it. From the actors to the choreography to a plot that would surprise you with how compelling it is, brains went into this play and consequently this film. The music is catchy from swing to jazz to rock with all other kinds of influences. Alan Cumming as the film's in-frame narrator plays his devious brainwashing character with sharp subtlety, cleverly appearing throughout the film as various different background characters. Comics from SNL vet Ana Gasteyer to voice artist John Kassir give the film the wacky edge it needs to be a hit.Starting off in a classroom with parents all wanting to learn about the marijuana, the story then launches into a film which Cumming's character shows about two teenage lovers (Christian Campbell and Kristen Bell), whose lives are fated do be destroyed by the reefer. Jimmy, the boy, wants desperately to impress Mary Lane after their smashing duet about ending up like Romeo &amp; Juliet ... however that play ends. He can't dance, however, and agrees to go home with a stranger, Jack Stone (Steven Weber) who promises to give him lessons though he only intends to get him hooked on weed like the other misfits in his cannabis- growing house: Ralph (Kassir) the college dropout, Sally the seductress who sells off her baby for dope money and the girlfriend Jack abuses, Mae (Gasteyer).Jimmy becomes addicted after a rhythmic musical number entitled "Jimmy Takes a Hit/The Orgy" and his life spirals out of control. Although he realizes he cares most about Mary Lane, his junkie friends keep him on a path of trouble. He won't even listen to Jesus despite a persuasive '60s rock-style number.It takes a true musical-lover to really get into the camp and silliness of "Reefer Madness," but it's one of the better recent movie musicals out there as nowadays they tend to be very hit or miss. The satire, the gore, the nutty characters, the ensemble members pretending to fornicate with their clothes on because after all, this is a 1930s film -- it's easy to get a kick out of this one-of-a-kind movie that should undoubtedly get its own cult following.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

The "narrator" played by Allen Cumming was like the narrator character in George of the Jungle; not just telling the facts but giving his opinions and effecting the story. In 1936 if the film had been made this way maybe more of a message would have been delivered. The original was silly and based on my times riding the school bus in High School obviously not based on actual observation of marijuana users. (NO, I AM NOT A USER AND NEVER HAVE BEEN) The film takes every stereotype of white America in the 1930's and uses it to the hilt. That poor Asian lady suddenly feeling a little uncomfortable when the "Fu Manchu" drug dealer gives Sally something for the baby was something the 1903's film makers wouldn't have even considered.

		<fullReview>stars: Christian Campbell, Kristin Bell, Ana Gatsayer, Steven Weber, John Kassir, Alan Cumming, Amy Spanger and Neve Campbell.This has to be one of the most bizarre films ever. Some lowlife (Weber) shares his reefer with sweet little Jimmy (Campbell) and the party begins. It takes place in 1936 and the beginning really played off of the years. The first 30 minutes were so campy and funny and had good songs, then there's a dry patch where the songs are not only average, but over-long and it gets repetitive. The last 30 minutes get back on track and more amusing as non-stop drug use, murder and cannibalism takes place when Ralph gets the munchies. Kristin Bell is excellent as the love interest innocent school girl and Kassir is great as the hallucinating horny pal and even Ana Gatsayer is hilarious. Though there are dry patches, it still does deliver.My rating-B minus. rated R for lotsa drug use, some sexuality and gory violence. 103 mins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you don't enjoy this movie you aren't familiar with the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that most people saying bad things about this movie must think it takes itself seriously, which says something about the people to begin with. If you know the original 1936 version, this movie is awesome, otherwise you'll likely be confused. It is a sarcastic version of the original film with some great campy music, with great choreography. The songs that have nothing to do with pot are some of the best. It may seem like it was convenient for rhyming purposes to call the love interest Mary Lane, yet that was her name in the 1936 version, long before they called pot Mary Jane. Just a great coincidence that made for great rhyming. The DVD includes the hour long 1936 movie, if you haven't seen it, watch it first. This really is a musical version of that same story, pot paranoia intact, as the original was misinformed scare tactics. Despite your stance on legalization, you can't deny that the original film grossly exaggerated the effects. One hit and people become killers and whores. The movie is first and foremost a goofy musical comedy though. If you are looking for a message you won't find one except maybe the fact that people used to believe anything they saw on film. Don't judge this movie without seeing the original though, and if you don't get a laugh out of the original, you wont out of this either. It is required viewing, so much that they included it on the DVD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even as I sat down to write this review, I had to remind myself I just saw a movie. Reefer Madness plays on screen so fresh as a stage performance, that I was immediately carried by smoke clouds into a theatre to watch this delightful play.The cast overacts every scene to sheer perfection, delivering every witty line of dialogue with enough power to make the audience laugh their high away. Speaking of dialogue, it is crisp and full of flavor. You get the sense that Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney tried to see who could make the other laugh the hardest while writing the play.The film stays mostly true to the original propaganda film that it is adapted from. Add in the catchy scores that stick with you long after the film and a few hilarious scenes, and you have the modern rendition: A group of teens fall into marijuana's trap in an over-the-top, colorful comedy that is so enjoyable, it is just as good the second and third times through.Personally, I am not a fan of musicals (Moulin Rouge being my rare exception), but after renting this movie, I have already begun my search on a way to purchase it. I could watch it routinely and never lose a moment of fun. And, No! You don't have to be high to like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The birth of a new cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant, innovative, clever, and incredibly catchy, Reefer Madness is one of the best musicals I've ever seen. The entire cast was absolutely fantastic in their characters. The three that definitely shined the most were: stage-veteran Christian Campbell as the naive Jimmy, a dimple-faced angel who turns into a giggling sex addict after one puff of the demon weed; the annoyingly cute Kristen Bell as the doomed Mary Lane, the squeaky clean virgin who takes one hit and turns into a frighteningly sexy dominatrix; and the richly talented Alan Cumming in many roles, primarily as the instigating Lecturer, who represents the rampant fear and misinformation that consumed middle America for the whole of the 20th century, giving birth to all the famous political struggles concerning minority groups, the Communist witch-hunt, and the so-called War On Drugs.Another favorite was John Kassir as the maniacal pothead Ralph, although he merely haunts most of the movie without much input until the unforgettable reefer den scene where he tricks Mary into smoking a joint to get her out of her petticoat, but unwillingly becomes her bitch instead.Although the reviews have been mostly dismal, this movie is definitely worth seeing by those with a sense of humor. This is, after all, a movie with lots of dark comedy and controversial material. One scene that would surely raise hell is that of Sally selling her baby to the most stereotypical image of a China man ever cooked up, while two Asian women lounge on a bed in the background, smoking opium and making out. What people need to understand is that this is not a modern-day slam on Asians, but another example of America's own embarrassing stigmas they once had on minorities. Remember that little movie called "Breakfast at Tiffany's?" Need I say more?The only thing they could have done without was the "Step By Step" chick playing Joan of Arc and her god-awful French accent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tell your children...about this campy comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Reefer Madness" (Showtime, 4/24/05, 8 p.m.) is a heady, sweaty mix of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," "Little Shop of Horrors," and Monty Python that should be eagerly devoured by fans of outrageous black comedy and be energetically avoided by everyone else.For those unfamiliar with the original, "Reefer Madness" began life as a 1936 propaganda movie produced by '30s anti-drug czar Harry Anslinger (who lovingly has a high school named after him in the new version). The movie told an eerie tale about the evils of marijuana that was entirely based on nonfactual theories--chief among them that marijuana would lead its users to immorality, insanity, and jazz piano.The new, musical (!) version is an obvious take-off on the original's hysteria. A smug narrator (played with perfect pitch by Alan Manning) lectures a group of naive parents about the devil's weed. This segues into a movie-within-the-movie about Jimmy, a naive high schooler led down the primrose road by slick drug dealer Jack (Steven Weber) and his reluctant accomplice Mae ("SNL" vet Ana Gasteyer), who have nothing better to do than drag cute high school kids down the road to ruin.Critics have already noted that the '36 movie is too easy a target for satire, but that doesn't stop writers Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney from gleaning huge laughs from cultural naivete. Novices will be surprised to find that much of the new movie's most eye-rolling dialogue comes from the '36 original.And the cast has a ball with the concept. Ana Gasteyer is far too tall and formidable to be playing a slapped-around dame, but she's still a riot (with a surprisingly good singing voice). Cumming chews the scenery with the grand fervor of someone with the munchies. I could go on forever, but suffice to say, there's not a bum note in the whole cast.Be forewarned that this is comedy at its blackest. The gore gets laid on a little thick, there's a blasphemous musical number (shades of Monty Python's "Christmas in Heaven") that won't do liberals any favors, and the finale tries for social commentary after one-and-three-fourth-hours of campy fun.But "Reefer Madness" gives a hilarious nose-thumbing to those who are all too willing to let jingoists do their thinking for them. It's an absolute hoot."Reefer Madness" is unrated but would probably earn a PG-13 or R for brief nudity, sexual situations, and stylized violence and gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but pretty good for Showtime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got the chance to check out the Reefer Madness premiere in NYC last night (April 10) and while most of the cast was there (yum Kristen Bell!) that couldn't stop most people from noticing that the movie felt very long and dragged in certain spots. But why dwell on the bad? Kristen Bell is terrific as sweet and wholesome Mary Lane (get it, Mary Lane, rhymes with Jane) who knew Kristen was such an adept singer/dancer! There is a song called "Five and Dime" where Kristen all but dances out of her Mary-Janes (and for the fellas there is a scene where Kristen succumbs to the ravages of the deadly marijuana and goes all kinky crazy.... yeah, we're talking' patent leather bra and garters......but the real show stopper is Ana Gasteyer--this woman can sing, dance act and deliver a punch line like nobody's business! She has the best lines in the movie and gets the biggest laughs from the crowd. Alan Cumming is typically tongue in cheek and Christian Campbell is good but it continues to amaze me that he can still play 15 years old, pretty successfully too, even though he is actually 33! So all in all, a pretty good movie musical, but I wouldn't expect many Emmy noms?except for acting nods (hopefully) for Gasteyer and Bell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not mad, I tell you! I'm not! It just soothes my nerves. A little reefer never hurt anyone, right? Right?! Don't listen to that cretin who comes to town to explain the dangers of "marihuana." That lecturer (Alan Cumming, X-MEN 2) is the true enemy. He feeds fear into your hearts and minds (Bushism?)! He is the one fertilizing your prejudices. That film he shows you? All lies! One hit of the "deadly reefer" does not drive you toward insanity. It doesn't, I tell you! Jimmy Harper (Christian Campbell, PRETTY DEAD GIRL) is alive and well, I say! He lives in Humboldt County, California (or was it Berkeley), caring for his wife, Mary Lane (Kirsten Bell, VERONICA MARS) and their thirteen children. Their lives DO NOT (do you hear me!) mimic Romeo and Juliet's in any way! Fatalistic nihilism my butt! Jack Stone (Steven Weber, WILL &amp; GRACE) is a nice businessman. He sells pots and seeds (okay, so some of them look a bit suspicious but COME ON!) And when Mae Coleman (Ana Gasteyer, Saturday NIGHT LIVE) yells at him, well, she deserves what she gets! And invoking a song by Jesus! Oh, puhlllease! Is this really necessary? I touched "marihuana" once (well, maybe ten times ...this week) but that doesn't mean I need divine intervention from a Tom Jones-ish Christ figure who belts out Vegas-style songs from the cross, does it? I think not.And what about Ralph (John Kassir, TALES FROM THE CRYPT)? That poor, misunderstood cannibal. If you leave him alone without food of course he's going to revert back to his man-eating methods. Can we really judge him so plainly? This show is a sham, I tell you! A sham! And I won't stand for it! That lecturer is the true drug. He's the addiction. Believe him not! (This review in no way condones the use of ignorance by the makers of the original Reefer Madness ? 1937 ? nor is its intent to sway those with a penchant for drugs, sex, and more drugs away from their chosen recreation)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Smoke-a-smoke-a-smoke-a-Smoke-Me?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney sure do know their "Horrors"--as in ROCKY and LITTLE SHOP OF..., and they prove it with this quirky and fun if somewhat derivative send up of, well, musical send-ups, based on a goofy 1930's cautionary relic that has become in and of itself a cult classic, kind of the granddaddy of "gonzo cinema." What was a goofily earnest diatribe against the dangers of "wacky tobakky", has been transformed into a tuneful rant against the dangers of fascism, media manipulation and religious zealotry, while "borrowing" freely from the aforementioned musicals, (with slapdashes of everything from Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, to George Romero, to John Waters for good measure!) Its Frankensteinian heart worn sewn firmly on its sleeve and seed-peppered tongue planted firmly in cheek, MADNESS charts the story of "two innocent kids," Jimmy Harper (Christian Campbell of "TRICK") and Mary Lane (Kristen Bell, who created the role in the Off-Broadway version), and their fall from the grace of Good Clean American Living once they encounter the insidious embrace of "Mary Jane," thanks to the assorted lowlifes who are already ensnared in her wicked thrall.That includes Jack Stone (WINGS' Steven Weber), the ringleader who seduces the kids into his den of iniquity, hysterically masochistic Mae Coleman (SNL alum Ana Gasteyer), Jack's partner-in-puffing and personal punching bag, and the bong-brained second bananas Sally deBains (Amy Spanger) and Ralph Wiley (John Kassir, who looks like nothing less than a live-action, fleshier version of the character he's famous for giving life to, HBO's Cryptkeeper from "TALES FROM THE...").Although it is one of those musicals where you can virtually trace the point of origin of each song back to its source, ("Mary Jane/Mary Lane" combines bits of LITTLE SHOP'S "Suddenly, Seymour" and "Rose Tint My World" from ROCKY), the good news is that the musical as a whole is certainly more in keeping with a linear sense of storytelling, rather than ROCKY which gets downright "Theater of the Absurd" at times, and has a deeper message than LITTLE SHOP, though in some ways it shares some of that musical's glaring anachronisms (though FDR is supposed to be the president, a calendar in one scene is for the year 1956).However, even when the book, music and lyrics are less-than-complementary (which is not the case here), a musical can only be as entertaining as the cast who performs it, and REEFER has one of the gamest, energetic ensembles ever. Campbell and Bell have great chemistry together, and could just as easily be transposed into any of the other cult musicals with ease (Seymour/Audrey or Brad/Janet, anyone?) It's also nice to know that John Kassir can warble a twisted tune and cut a rug with the best utility character actors, while Amy Spanger, who I hadn't heard of before seeing this, certainly comes as a pleasant surprise. I had also not seen movie/TV vet Weber out of his element, although I understand he has played the Billy Flynn role in CHICAGO, and he certainly makes a good case for his casting here.But the standouts from the ensemble would have to be three particular players worth noting. Alan Cumming as the insidious "Lecturer", who presents the "educational film" that frames the dastardly, daffy doings in REEFER (think of Riff-Raff crossed with The Criminologist by way of CABARET'S Emcee), Gasteyer who is so spot-on as Mae, that you wish some smart producers would hire her more often for more comedies, and in a hallucinatory sequence that cribs from no less than Jesus Christ SUPERSTAR, Robert Torti (the original Jack Off-Broadway), in a showstopping number, in which he plays the Son of God as a Vegas-style headliner. (And do watch for a surprise cameo from a certain sibling who shares a song-and-dance background with Christian Campbell.)Thankfully, even if the numbers do borrow from the best, the tunes are catchy and the lyrics just as clever, (when was the last time someone actually rhymed "transubstantiation" in a musical number successfully?) and it all comes together much better than a cable-produced cult movie-musical probably has a right to.Definitely about as PC as the time period in which the source material was set, (with references to some unpretty racial stereotypes amidst the crazed carnality, mass cannabis consumption and cannibalism), REEFER MADNESS may not appeal to those with more delicate sensibilities, (especially if you've never heard of ROCKY HORROR or LITTLE SHOP). For those of us vets who have, though, have a blast with it. In spite of yourself, you may not be able to get enough of "The Stuff."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK i watched this movie the night it debuted on Showtime, funny, original, sexy and smart. Mary Lane was so sexy playing the girl next door, and May was sexy as the sultry pothead. The whole movie was well written, and had a lot of well placed laughs. the one thing i noticed in the movie was how much marijuana they were smoking, Since I recorded it, i decided to invite all my friends over to watch it, I made sure they all had their favorite bowls, and a lot of weed. Once we were all equipped with bowls aka marijuana smoking devices the fun began, because every time the characters took a hit, so did we. Lets just say by the middle of the movie we were nice and high, by the end we were falling down laughing, it was so smoky in my place, that we were afraid the neighbors might think my house was on fire... but really if you want to enjoy this movie to the extent we did, smoke every time they do. you will get super crunked, and it will make the movie absolutely awesome!!!

		<shortDescription>Opium Den?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who have seen the movie, can they tell me if the scene in the opium den where one of the main characters sell her child is included in the final cut? I am one of the girls smoking in the background in that scene but I don't have Showtime to see it for myself. If some one can confirm for me there is such a scene I will buy the DVD over the net.As a person that has worked in the movie, however little it was, I must say they did a really good job of making the movie over-the-top. I know one of the main points was to up play how the 1938 film was over-the-top in describing the effects of marijuana. Even in make-up and wardrobe they tried their best in making me as stereotypically Chinese hooker like as possible, sticking chopsticks in my hair that's pulled up in a bun, using the reddest of reds for my lipstick and the Chinese man that was in the scene had this foot-long mustache dangling from his upper lip!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yawn. Really uninteresting idea, poorly executed. I worry about the state of modern musicals when something like this can rate as high as it did. The songs were everything a song shouldn't be. Lame music, lamer lyrics. It was, very much, like watching bad improv. Not campy bad, just bad. Each one an absolute turd. Okay, enough kvetching. There were some good points. Which is why it rated 5 and not 0. Ana Gasteyer was brilliant, very funny and she has an amazing voice. The choreography was quite clever and fun. The sets and the way it was shot were also quite good. It just all sinks under the leaden songs. I had, possibly, too high hopes for this. Now I just hoped I was high while watching it. Bad joke, I know. I couldn't help myself. The thing is they should have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a very entertaining movie. I laughed, i cried, i felt my testicles pull upward into my gut as i realized i was watching a musical. Alan Cummings is alright - he's stranger that a pillow stuffed with bunnies, but his character calls for it. There is this one hot chick who plays Joan of Arc - she's a bombshell, a total bombshell. ...So i looked her up on IMDb and it turns out that she used to play Al on Step by Step. Now all i have to do is get my time machine working and go back to when that show was on the air, ask her out, and marry her on the 24th of April. That would be a good day. A good day for a wedding. We would have pineapple and ham pizza, bottled water, and corn chips. Corn chips and lots of dip!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it, what a wonderful interpretation of a screen classic. I loved the writing, songs, and most of the acting, but I have to speak up about Steven Weber, his singing is among the worst I have heard in a musical. I realized his character "Jack" is supposed to be a sleaze, but couldn't they have at least dubbed his singing voice? In my opinion they should have kept Robert Torti in the roll of Jack as they did on Broadway, he could have pulled off the roll of Jack &amp; Jesus flawlessly. Other than that the movie is a classic. I just had to say what others had failed to mention. I can see this film going down as an all time favorite. I can imagine it will be a standard at pot parties all over America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable if you're in the mood for musical satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best part about this satirical musical remake of the infamously inept anti-marijuana docudrama "Tell Your Children" -- which was revived in 1972 by NORML as "Reefer Madness" -- are the imaginative lyrics &amp; extravagant production on the less-than-Arthur Freed dance numbers. Alan Cummings gets most of the best lines, many pointed at the current arch-conservative state of U.S. politics. The leads are suitably cute and reasonably talented, but there is not a truly catchy number in the entire play for them or anyone else to sing. Format also suffers by making most of the music 50's &amp; 80's rock-style instead of a more-appropriate (and more fun) 30's swing-style. Acid lyrics about politics, sex, &amp; drugs are wasted on these lame modern melodies. Oh, and although she is prominently featured in the advertising, Neve Campbell only appears in one musical number; I would have preferred to see more of her and less of the miscast Ana Gasteyer.</fullReview>

The plot of the movie was absolutely gratifying. Alan Cumming is a very talented actor, and proved himself yet again with his role in the film.This film contained a lot of dark comedy and a lot of awesome singing and dancing.
