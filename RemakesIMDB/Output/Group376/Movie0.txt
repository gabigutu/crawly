		<shortDescription>It's 10 o'clock. Do you know why your children are cackling insanely?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Reefer Madness" (originally "Tell Your Children") was created to teach parents that it's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids. Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin. We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:- laughing maniacally while running people down in the street- playing the piano too fast- having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much- accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well- having no recollection of being framed for murderIf your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict. The solution is simple: force them to watch "Reefer Madness" because if we don't heed its warning, "Reefer Madness 2" will be coming to a theater near you or you... OR YOU!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gone with the Wind of 30's Exploitation Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of 70's NORML propaganda falsely claiming that the FBI sponsored Reefer Madness, most viewers believe that this Exploitation classic was meant to be taken seriously. Not so! Thelma White (Mae) has noted in interviews that the producers and director Louis Gasnier asked the cast to "hoke it up." The famous "Faster, Faster" scene is, in fact, a direct parody of a similar scene in the classic musical 42nd Street (a scene in which Dave O'Brien--Ralph in Reefer Madness--played a chorus boy). So why make a cautionary tale, but do so tongue-in-cheek? Simple. To get around the Hays Code and show more skin than the Code allowed...but also to capitalize on the public's fear of drugs. Either way, the producers made a ton of money on the Exploitation circuit--more than covering their costs for this relatively expensive sub-Poverty Row production. Made over the course of 3 weeks (most Exploitation films were shot in a few days), using an experienced director and a couple of talented actors who went on to have respectable careers in Hollywood, Reefer Madness is quite simply the finest Exploitation film to come out of the 30's. The film's funny, is it? Well, the folks who made it thought so too. And they laughed all the way to the bank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well. it's an alternative classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe the hype. This is one of the most hilariously over-the-top pieces of propaganda ever committed to celluloid. It's constantly unintentionally hilarious, especially Dave O'Brein's performance as Ralph.So, what happens when a bunch of clean-cut teenagers (who strangely look like they're in their thirties) take one of puff of the evil vile devil's weed? They become homicidal perverted rapist dope-head fiends! There is so much useful information to be obtained from this film. For instance, did you know that marijuana is worse than cocaine? Or did you know how to hide your joints in your high heel shoes? Or that marijuana causes lifetime insanity? It's all here in this underground cult classic. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1930's potheads become hopelessly and incurably insane?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is funny. Not just regular funny but inexplicably funny. I wish public schools all over the country would show this movie in classes. This cult classic gives what is supposed to be a serious warning of the dangers of marijuana. Instead the over exaggeration of the side effects of weed become un-intentionally and absurdly funny. I smoked grass in my day but I sure haven't killed anyone yet. This movie is legendary. Anyone who has ever smoked should view this. Just if only to see how this whole silly "war on drugs" thing got started. Is pot ever to be legalized? Probably not so long as there are people who take this movie seriously. As for the rest of us laugh yourself into hopeless and incurible insanity for 67 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No wonder people like drugs so much! This movie makes them look fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My 10/10 rating is of course because "Reefer Madness" is so bad that it's good. And boy is it! Meant as an anti-marijuana propaganda film, the whole thing basically makes marijuana look fun. The plot has some wholesome teenagers getting duped into smoking marijuana and turning into lunatics (thereby idiotically implying "One puff and you're hooked!"). The first mistake that the movie makes is calling marijuana a narcotic; anyone should know that marijuana is a weed. Obviously, the law-and-order types have always used this type of propaganda to arrest anyone whom they don't like. But anyway, "Reefer Madness" is unintentionally hilarious. "That '70s Show" once did a spoof of it, portraying Red imagining Eric getting addicted. For the record, there's no such thing as marijuana addiction; people just like smoking it. And who wouldn't want to try some after watching this movie?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the many scholastic films Ive seen in my time, this has to be the most hilarious piece of tripe ive ever seen. The setting is a small urban town, in the mid thirties. Everyones all happy, and everyone seems normal, that is, everyone BUT the shifty, shady, marijuana dealers who look just like *Gasp* you and me! They look so normal, lure your children into their home, and sell them exotic herbs from far away places! All whilst turning your children into sex maniacs, one puff hookers, and violent terrorists high on life (and that's not all!) Fun for the whole family (well...it all depends on your family...), this is a great flick, worth the watch! - "Two Green Thumbs Up!" Joe &amp; Jay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The madness...the madness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not, but I just bought this a couple of days ago on DVD for a little over six bucks! And trust me, Reefer Madness is worth the money, since it is one of the funnier propaganda films to come out of the 1930s. While the DVD doesn't contain a lot of extras, you do get a short biography on the star of the film, along with a look at the original poster for Reefer Madness and trivia questions! If you want to check this movie out some time, I would advise waiting until the Special Edition comes out in April. Why? Because MST3k host Mike Nelson will provide audio commentary for the film! I'll definitely have to get the new DVD if Nelson himself is involved. And really, this film is rife for commentary. Right from the start we got a pre-Star Wars crawl which basically states while the film's characters and plot are entirely fictional, they are based on a true story which could happen to you...or you...or YOU! It is here where I laughed the hardest, as later on things get pretty grim in a Days of Our Lives sort of way. I especially liked how the word "marijuana" was spelled "marihuana" in the film. I have no idea when or why the spelling of this word changed, but it was still amusing. Also, the DVD's scene index lists one of the scenes as "principle's office." They couldn't even spell the word "principal" right! I mean, you can't actually go to the office of a principle, can you? Darn right ya can't! Anyway, back to the movie. As I said, it's a very enthusiastic propaganda film which lies back and forth about the effects of "marihuana" so as to scare parents into discussing the drug with their children (hence the original title, Tell Your Children...think of them, please!!!). What are some of the effects of the deadly, demonic, and just plain EVIL marihuana? Well, first you laugh (gasp!), then hallucinate (double gasp!), and then you begin committing acts of random violence (triple gasp!). The teens are all portrayed by men and women with receding hairlines and wrinkles, making me quite confused. I literally sat there wondering, "Why would adults be hanging out with these younger kids? Oh...they're all supposed to be kids? Um, okay, sure. What the heck." The principal (principle?) in the movie is equally funny, as during the murder trial of a kid who smoked dope and supposedly shot his girlfriend he lists many instances when he thought the kid was high. His testimony: Bill started laughing during a very serious discussion on Shakespeare (blasphemy!), and also missed the ball by a good 3-4 feet during a tennis match (good holy gravy!). How would this kind of testimony hold up in court? Maybe the kid just remembered a good joke during class and isn't any good at tennis? Did anyone think of that, huh? Huh? As for the murder itself, it's also completely moronic and unbelievable. First off, the gun is aimed at the floor but somehow manages to shoot the girl in the back. Then when we see the wound it's about the size of a mosquito bite with no blood whatsoever. Ah, the wonders of 1930s Hollywood makeup! Much more awaits the viewer of Reefer Madness, including a crazed piano player who's "hot" on the "dope" and about to "crack" (these kids with their drug lingo!) and an odd scene where the main character's little brother pines about his model airplane for what seems like an eternity. Seeing as how this story is supposedly being related to us by the principal, why would he have bothered to include the aforementioned scene? And how did he know about it in the first place? Did he interrogate the little brother? Hoo boy, so many questions about continuity. Oh well, I guess I'll leave them to be answered by you good folks. Enjoy! 1/4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I doubt that anyone still takes this movie seriously these days but it's funny seeing how people went paranoid about pot in the 30's. There are lots of wildly exaggerated or plain wrong comments and accusations in it. Best among them are that pot is more dangerous than Heroin, it will make you violent and eventually incurably insane.The film details how smoking pot changes the lives of a couple of all-american teenagers. In fact, they're so clean cut, nice to their parents and just plain perfect that you're actually happy when their lives turn bad. On the way there we see some really funny overacting and the way that middle America thought people behaved after smoking pot. A single puff immediately has you in hysterics, after a couple of minutes it's down to pre-marital sex (hey, that's enough to get me hooked!), followed by a violent paranoia and finally of course, insanity.The film is fairly standard propaganda stuff and follows the three important propaganda ingredients to a T. It's badly acted, exaggerated in hammering home a couple of points and frightening the uninformed about the fact that no one is safe from this great danger. It is however fairly lengthy for a propaganda movie and it's not as ridiculous as I expected. Although there are some really funny scenes that rightly make this a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Entertaining For The Wrong Reasons And As Propaganda It Becomes Ironic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film often thought of as propaganda at its most blatant . Some comments here indicate that it might have been produced as some kind of parody . Watching it you're certainly struck by the lack of both internal continuity and internal logic of REEFER MADNESS and you often become confused as to what point the film is trying to make Take the opening foreword that claims marijuana is destroying the youth of America in increasingly large numbers because of its effects where time slows down and becomes fixed ... the loss of all power to resist physical emotions . It's interesting that there's very little in American culture of the 1930s that suggests youth was being affected by marijuana . Apart from this one can anyone name any other (in)famous films featuring marijuana ? Even the opening tirade by Dr Carroll shoots itself in the foot by stating there's many drug traffickers bringing the substance in to the country only to have the film point out later that it's a naturally growing substance in every American state so why the need for traffickers ? Probably because the film needs villains On the subject of villainy ask yourself this - how well regarded a movie would this be if it had been set in the 1920s and the mobsters were peddling not dope but booze ? We're treated to a laughable scene where an erstwhile bootlegger tells his boss that he has qualms about giving weed to schoolkids only for his boss to state that if he doesn't do as he's told he'll be got rid off permanently . So when alcohol was legalised again the bootleggers stood outside school gates giving kids weed ? One can't help thinking there's a certain amount of artistic license going on . Certainly the mobsters aren't too bright as one tough guy allows himself to be driven around by someone who's just had a spliff to smoke . Be honest would you get in to a car with someone who's seriously toked up ? And if it's such a menace to society why not legalise it the same with alcohol ? The story proper revolves around sweet couple Billy and Mary who are obviously so pious and virginal it's almost sickening . I actually felt happy for them when they were introduced to the joys of jazz and marijuana and why shouldn't I ? Is quoting Romeo And Juliet and tennis practice a satisfying substitute for premarital sex ? Surely if you're buying a car you should take it for a test drive ? There does seem to be more problems with the continuity and that is everyone seems to be hyperactive on every level at the drugs den . Maybe the drugs crowd are also snorting massive amounts of cocaine in the flat ? Certainly it can't be the marijuana because everyone seems to be smoking their spliffs like cigars - without inhaling . This all eventually leads to the death of Mary who accidentally gets shot after Billy saves her from getting raped . No matter how much dope they've ingested I'm sure if anyone was able to stop a rape they'd be able to remember the events . Strangely according to this film not only does weed stop you remembering being a hero it also affects the hearing . A bunch of stoners are in a flat where a woman screams but no one hears anything ? I think the Nazis used the same excuse at Nuremberg but they didn't claim to be on anything Being a Hollywood movie from this period where The Hays Code was strictly enforced the innocent must be saved while the guilty must be punished no matter how contrived it may be and boy does REEFER MADNESS have a contrived ending . Wiley , the man who tried to rape Mary is to be gotten rid off by the mob but apparently drugs now make him telepathic so batters a mobster to death , is arrested and his fancy woman turns stoolie thereby letting Billy off the hook As I said if the story had revolved around bootleggers in the prohibition era then this would have been a totally forgotten B movie . But since it has a hysterical tone against marijuana it has developed a cult following for entirely ironic reasons . There is scientific evidence that marijuana is linked to mental health problems depending on how young the user started taking the drug but to bombard people with propaganda that is obviously exaggerated and risible does more harm than good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the producers of "Reefer Madness" had intended to produce a campy, neurotic cult film, they could not have succeeded better. Of course, the film had a different intent, to portray the "frightful toll of the new drug menace - Marihuana is that drug - a violent narcotic - the real Public Enemy Number One"!The film does have it's seedy moments in capturing the smoky atmosphere of the local drug hangout, where dope pushers bring their unwary teenage victims to turn them on to marijuana's excesses. But it takes a huge leap to make the connection between it's casual use and the resulting consequences of hit and run driving, rape, and even murder. There are some memorable scenes - the frenetic piano player reminiscent of Seinfeld's Kramer, the attempted seduction scene of high schooler Mary witnessed by her boyfriend Bill, the aforementioned car accident involving Mary's brother Jimmy, and the jury room scene deciding Bill's fate where the light pull resembles a hangman's noose. The film today is an incredible period piece that makes one think about how society perceived drug use and how the government attempted to influence behavior. For that it's worth viewing, if only once to experience it's cultish appeal.</fullReview>

Regardless of whether you think confusing neurons is a good idea, you mind find it interesting to notice the narrative structure of this film. Now remember this is well before 'Citizen Kane' reinvented the narrative in film and slightly before 'Sullivan's Travels' started the trend.The story is a story within a story within a dream within a vision, with multiple side stories dreams and visions along the way. Try to diagram this to see where you really are and you'll be shocked at how close it comes to the pathology of being stoned.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-Budget but Good Work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma White is the actress who really makes this anti-drug flick memorable. She portrays "Mae", who runs a drug den out of her late 30s apartment. Most of her scenes are shallow and brief but at the end she redeems herself in a memorable confession scene. The camera moves up close to catch her emotions and she really delivers when she says she didn't mean to hurt anybody to the DA. I don't know what happened to Thelma White before or after but she and the rest of the cast try valiantly to make this low-budget exploitation film work. "Reefer Madness" has become a joke movie--one everyone is expected to howl at and parody. That's unfortunate but understandable. I love to watch these roadshow exploitation movies from the 30s and early 40s and wonder about the fate of the cast and the crew, wonder about where they got their wardrobes and how were they hired? Was their a "Want Ad" in the Hollywood Reporter or did the film makers use their own friends, neighbors?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally released in 1936 as an independent propaganda film, Reefer Madness (aka Tell Your Children) is in a more modern light extremely funny. Its over-the-top and completely unrealistic portrayal of the potentially life threatening consequences of even limited marijuana use are enough to send the viewer into hysterics.*Spoiler Alert*Of the four or five wholesome and innocent all-American teens who are exposed to the evil wrath of marijuana, one gets shot and two more end up accidentally killing people. There's also lots of premarital sex, which at the time of this film's original release was a huge no-no. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic, for all the wrong reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Reefer Madness" describes marijuana as "the new drug menace, which is destroying the youth of America". And you would think that this might just be a hyperbolic tagline on an anti-drug poster, but the filmmakers back that up with an alarmingly earnest sense of paranoia and hysteria. They're serious. As an unintentional comedy, "Reefer Madness" takes its time getting going. The dialogue of these unrelatable characters is peppered with the usual "swell"s, "gee"s, etc. of the time. The real fun occurs when the wretched mary jane rears its ugly head. Pretty soon, those evil pushers have gotten our upright moral youth speeding off after a vehicular homicide, raping young girls, shooting people, window-diving, and descending into general madness. And then they listen to that risqué jazz music!It's not hard to see why this movie's a cult classic. It's absurd in its warnings, firebrand in its portrayals, and undeniably goofy. But that's how it comes off now. I really do wonder how effective this movie was in what seems like the original "Just Say No" campaign. Did people take this seriously? Judging from the continuation of such dire warning movies as "Boys Beware" [1961] (extolling the dangers of homosexuals), it'd be easy to conclude so. And that just makes this all the more amusing.A 7/10 on the ridiculous scale</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cautionary tale of the killer dope ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the exploitation films of the 1930s focusing on the evils of drug taking, 'Reefer Madness' shows us a group of high school kids swept up by the menace of the killer weed, marijuana. From the moment they go up to Mae's for a smoke, strange behaviour ensues, from violent laughter at Shakespeare, to hit and run, murder, and total insanity.Put together under the disguise of a public information film, this shameless low budget shocker exploits every myth you can think of about drugs, bookended by a lecture from a sombre-faced school principal. The small group of kids who fall foul of the reefers don't have much of a life outside of their visits upstairs, and therefore their characters aren't rounded enough for us to care.Low budget and funny, this film is a true representative of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tell Your Children (aka Reefer Madness)- 1936</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actors: Dorothy Short, Kenneth Craig, Lillian Miles, Dave O'Brien, Thelma White, Carleton Young, Warren McCollum, Pat Royale &amp; Joseph Forte I saw this film on TV last week for the first time and had to watch after hearing of the propaganda label assigned to it. High school principal Dr. Carroll is speaking to a gathering of parents at his school about the addictive effects of marijuana. The shocked group learns it is even more addictive than opium, morphine or heroin, and will cause hallucinations, violence and sexual promiscuity. Newspaper headlines are shown to support this fact and he recaps a recent occurrence which they have no doubt heard of, and the movie continues as he tells them the 'real' story! Before going any further, I'd like to mention the film was financed by a church group to deter the younger generation from falling prey to the evil marijuana, called 'Tell Your Children'. An ambitious exploitive filmmaker named Dwain Esper purchased the rights to the film and added a number of provocative scenes and changed the title to 'Reefer Madness'. It was rediscovered in the early '70's and became a camp classic. The doctor's narration tells of dope dealers (Jack and Mae) who lure teenagers to an apartment and casually offer joints, which immediately leave them hooked and acting as goofy and irresponsible as the other weirdos who partake. Jimmy and Bill are soon hooked and spending a lot of their time partying and becoming irresponsible. We are shown scenes of a small cafe where an addicted piano player puffs away while playing the piano at a blistering pace. The other regulars laugh uncontrollably, dance at a dizzying pace and can't wait to have sex! When Jack runs out of reefer, Jimmy drives him to get more and he insists he's okay to drive whenever Jack asks. In a fairly realistic scene, a wild- eyed, speeding Jimmy runs over and kills a pedestrian. Jack says he'll help to protect Jimmy from the police. Meanwhile, Bill's really into the reefer, so much so that he giggles his way into the bedroom with the giggling seductress, Blanche. They show some necking and the scene shifts to Bill coming around and realizing what he's done, as Blanche lays in the bed asleep. Now Mary arrives at the apartment looking for her Bill and one of the regulars, Ralph, who has been acting more and more out of control with his incessant laughing and deep toking, offers her a joint, which I believe she assumes to be a cigarette. Yeah, Mary's no different, she's instantly giggling away and tolerating Ralph's liberal touching up to the point when he attempts to rape her. But now, a dazed and remorseful Bill wanders out of the bedroom to see them 'making out'. He jumps Ralph and as the two are fighting, Jack tries to break up the fight and he hits Bill with the butt of his gun. And then, tragedy, the gun fires and Mary is dead! Then Bill's knocked out and Jack places the gun in Bill's hand, then revives him. Of course, Bill's so strung out that he believes he shot his beloved Mary. Blanche calls the police and poor Bill is in jail, awaiting trial. Now we get to see some over the top acting as Ralph becomes increasingly irritable and panicky, wanting to confess that Bill is innocent. Jack doesn't want the police to find out about his marijuana haven and tells all to his boss, who directs him to kill Ralph. When the scene shifts back to the apartment , we are treated to an increasingly insane Ralph fighting a losing battle to keep calm. Blanche obliges Ralph by playing the piano to calm him down and what follows is the most hilarious thing I've seen in a while, as he asks Blanche to play faster, and faster, and... (you get the picture?). He keeps bellowing at her to play faster and I'm surprised smoke wasn't rising from the keys, with Blanche's frantic playing. Then Jack comes in and I suspect marijuana also makes you highly intuitive because even though I thought Jack acted cool as a cucumber, Ralph knew he was there to kill him! The two fight and Ralph gets the upper hand, bludgeoning Jack to death, to the horror of Blanche And Mae. The police arrive and Ralph is arrested for Jack's murder. Blanche eventually confesses that Bill is innocent and she is to testify at Ralph's trial. As she walks down a hallway with her female guard, her mind races with the events of the last several days and she breaks free of the guard's light grip to dive out the window to her death, her heroic way of atoning for getting involved with marijuana. Bill is lectured and set free by the kindly judge, who insists Bill remain to attend Ralph's trial. An insane Ralph is led into the courtroom and the judge agrees to for-ego the trial at the request of both prosecution and defense. Instead, he is sentenced to remain in an asylum for the criminally insane 'for the rest of his natural life'. I'm sure Bill has learned his lesson. The film ends with the principal warning the gathered parents that the tragic events are likely to happen again, the next tragedy may be that of your daughter's, or your son's, or yours, or yours..., then he points directly at the camera and sternly warns, 'or yours'!I thoroughly enjoyed the film, mainly because of the time period in which it was made and the over the top acting; it ran for about one hour and ten minutes. I've heard of a colourized version of this film on DVD, with the marijuana smoke changing colour to reflect the various moods. It's obvious to anyone watching this film that marijuana is far more dangerous than heroin, morphine or opium and will make you want to have sex before you are married.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why no one changed their name after appearing in "Tell Your Children," aka "Reefer Madness," I'll never know. Perhaps some of them did - I only checked a few names.This is possibly the worst acted, campiest, most absurd movie ever made, a laugh riot from beginning to end. A cautionary tale is told to parents of high-schoolers (who must have all married late - they looked really past it) about the dangers of marijuana use among the young. Marijuana here is spelled marihuana and is described as worse than heroin or cocaine - one puff and you're hooked. The description of the symptoms is that first you break into uncontrollable laughter, then you become frenetic, and then, your mind altered, you do insane things. In this story, there was a hit and run where this kid just mowed down somebody in the street as if he wasn't there, a near-rape, and an accidental shooting blamed on an innocent young man who is brought to trial.Well, I'm from the '60s, so right away, you know I'm howling at this thing. This marihuana must have been laced with amphetamine, because one thing you never see in stoned people is frenetic behavior unless it's toward food. It's mind-altering, all right - you totally zone out. These kids were dancing like maniacs. Also, there were no deep intakes of the weed which is then held a bit before expelling the smoke - no, these people were smoking this stuff like cigarettes except they weren't inhaling. At all. You never saw so much smoke.Now to the performances. Let's start with handsome Dave O'Brien as Ralph, one of the older procurers of the young, who then introduced kids to this powerful substance. O'Brien is one who DID change his name when he turned to comedy writing. I would have done it right after this film. He had the uncontrollable laughter down pat - he did it constantly. And the film was made so cheaply, every time he took a puff, the exact same clip of him laughing was shown again. It was a totally unbelievable laugh, too. By the end of the movie his eye makeup was smeared so he looked like a raccoon. I'm not sure what that look was supposed to represent. I was actually going to write more about the performances. I'll just leave it that they were horrible and amateurish.I gave this a 4 for camp value ONLY. It is a ridiculous movie. I am not a believer in smoking marijuana, I am not a believer in substance abuse, and our kids have enough trouble living their lives without getting into problems with marijuana, drugs, or alcohol. However, did people really believe this to be the truth in 1936? Or was this movie deliberately done as a gross exaggeration? If so, it is unconscionable, not to mention misleading, particularly to tell people that marihuana is worse than cocaine and heroin. Give me a break. I can only hope that when this film was released, people laughed as hard as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reefer Madness, the granddaddy of all midnight cult movies, is a classic on all counts.Let me start off by saying I don't smoke marijuana (or marihuina, as it is spelled in this movie) and I don't believe kids should be smoking pot, but this movie is so over the top in it's depiction of what happens when a person smokes the demon weed that it is hilarious.According to this film, which was made as an educational tool for parents in the 1930's, after just one hit off of a joint the smoker will turn into a wild eyed, deranged addict who will jump into bed with anyone, or become homicidal or suicidal. With all seriousness, the makers of this movie claim reefer is more addictive than heroin, will cause hallucinations and is a narcotic. If this film is to be believed, smoking a doobie will lead to permanent insanity!!!One classic scene shows two "hopheads" at a piano, while one screams, "Faster, Faster" as the other plays maniacally on the piano, reefer dangling from her lips. It has to be seen to be believed. I don't know about any one else, but I have personally never seen anyone under the influence of marijuana act this way...they may nod off or get extremely hungry, but not start banging on a piano while screaming and laughing hysterically. If this was meant to scare kids from trying pot, I think it missed it's mark. The kids on the devil's weed in this film are having a hell of a good time, and isn't that what most teenagers want...a good time?If you have never seen this movie, you have to see it.</fullReview>

It's that magical combination of bad acting, lousy scriptwriting, and pure absurdity. The allegations they throw about marijuana are so wrong it's comical...and watching the people go "mad" on weed is pure, hilarious farce. Great movie to watch on a boring night. The colourized version is even funnier, because they cleverly made the marijuana smoke crazy shades like hot pink and neon green. I haven't laughed so hard during a movie in a long time.

		<fullReview>Make no mistake about it. This is the mother of all campy cult flicks. This film played out as a midnight movie, long before 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' (1975)set the standard for films to see blasted out of your head on whatever you can get your hands on (although weed was the preferred choice for this one). It was produced back in 1936 as a health warning film for adults who's youngsters were being seduced by deadly evil marijuana (spelled marihuana for this outing--go figure). If this film was taken the least bit seriously way back in the day is anybody's guess. All I know that this rediscovered film played out to potheads in the early to mid 1970's at midnight screenings (usually shown with either early cartoons or a Three Stooges two reel short,due to it's short running time of just over an hour. It was shot on a shoe string budget, and it shows it (I wouldn't want it any other way!). It's cast is mostly a bunch of unknowns (at least by today's standards), but does feature Dave O'Brien in a stand out role as a hop head (as weed smokers were called in those days). O'Brien was largely known in a bunch of two reelers for Pete Smith, back in the day. This is a film that is well worth checking out (straight,or stoned out of your bird,it's big fun).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reefer Madness in COLOR is a great campy weed movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the one that started it all. The First drug movie ever and it's great. Many crummy DVD versions of Reefer Madness are out there (bad dirty prints, poor contrast). But thankfully 20th Century Fox released (on 4/20 - get it?) a beautifully restored version of the movie. And then they went one further and added a COLOR version on the same DVD. But wait, there's more, they also added a great commentary by Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theater which really caps off this definitive release.The movie itself is perfect for a Mike Nelson riff. It's definitely one of those "It's so bad it's good" movies. Originally made as a 1930's propaganda film, it was meant to scare America 's youth away from drugs, showing them that one puff of the 'demon weed' turns teens into raving reefer addicts. In this hilarious cautionary tale, those who do inhale find themselves plunged into a web of murder, sex, lunacy, and jazz music. Now, years later, this ham-fisted effort to warn you off weed has become the height of camp entertainment. A movie so beautifully bad, it's great.If you want to take a TRIP back to the 1930's and see what your Grandfather's potheads were all about, this is the movie for you. Fire it up any time! And get the Fox version to enjoy it in psychadellic color - they even blow colored dope smoke!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My review refers to the new, colorized version of REEFER MADNESS (released in April, 2004.) Originally called TELL YOUR CHILDREN, this 1938 movie's been known as REEFER MADNESS since at least the seventies. There are three very good reasons to watch this DVD: The colorization makes the bland visuals of this propaganda film bearable; the commentary track by members of the colorization team is informative and witty; and the other commentary track (by Mike Nelson of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000) allows the lone viewer to feel something of the effect of sitting in a room with a friend goofing on a movie. I have not watched the two other extra features, which are a new trailer for REEFER MADNESS and a new short called GRANDPA'S MARIJUANA HANDBOOK. I'll check out the new trailer, but the brief few seconds I saw of GRANDPA looked like pro-marijuana propaganda, which bores me. REEFER MADNESS is also presented in the original black and white version, so this is a truly complete DVD package. When the DVD menu is on the screen, marvelous recordings from the jazz-age play in the background. (The songs, of course, are related to marijuana, and they provide counterpoint to the put-your-blinders-on tenor of the movie. I wish there were a separate track consisting of such songs and that they were listed so as to be selected and played. For film buffs, the commentary on the colorization is the best part of this DVD after the colorization itself. Of course, the movie is unintentionally funny, and Bob Nelson's wisecracks are fun, but I loved learning the WHYs and WHEREFOREs of the restoration of this movie. The colorization is superb. Each character blows smoke of a hue to match his or her personality. Location shots show the garish colors of the depression-era billboards in the background. This restoration is vibrant. REEFER MADNESS is, as I've said, unintentionally funny, but it is also deeply dishonest, made, as it was, by people bent on bullying the young into behaving. Have the restorers painted a mustache on this monsterpiece? No. What has been painted on it is a warm smile. And that makes it worth watching, finally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without the "war on drugs" this would be one funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure I was laughing! I laughed about the bad, baaaad acting; the absurd premise and the horrible directing, convincing me that the crew must have been stoned. I laughed at the piano being played too fast, the maniacally laughing and the accidental shooting. I cracked up at lines like "one puff and you're hooked", the ludicrous supposition that Marihuana (apparently pronounced "Maahr-Wanna" in those parts of the world) is a narcotic and the assumption that THC, similar to thinking-too-hard-and-too-much, will drive you psychotic.And sure, I had just smoked a huge joint, having watched this during a holiday in Amsterdam and was high like a kite (though I have to admit: I didn't feel like playing the piano too fast, nor did it inspire me to gun anybody down).But then I began to reflect: this movie is almost 80-years old and there were still people who believed the hackneyed nonsense it propagated. I thought about all the ruined lives of those who had been caught with a few joints. I thought about Aids, cancer and multiple scleroses patients who are denied alternative medication and about all the lives that have been lost in the so-called "war on drugs" that keeps the mafia and drug-cartels alive and prosperous.That's when I stopped laughing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Bad Films of the 1930s?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Misinforming, pompous, self-righteous (in the figure of the school official played by Joseph Forte), TELL YOUR CHILDREN (better known as REEFER MADNESS) is usually pushed as one of the worst films ever made. It made the Medved Brothers FIFTY WORST FILMS book, along with such dreck as ROBOT MONSTER, but is revived and revivable more than most of the titles in that list/book. Why?My guess is that it is more than the idiotic view of marijuana cigarettes and drug addiction. Or the sometimes ridiculous dialog (why would some teenager state that he never drinks that stuff, meaning he never drinks sodas?). I think it is the fascination this film brings to us because it has things working for it, and it is unique for it's time and place, and it does give us a view of what the public of the 1930s would accept or reject for discussion.I mentioned a few days ago that the movie FLESH AND THE DEVIL (from the 1920s) had a bad script which should have built up on a theme of homosexual love between Lars Hanson and John Gilbert, the close friends competing for Greta Garbo. But, as I said, the America of Calvin Coolidge would not tolerate open discussion of homosexuality. So the two male stars had to use their all to show their friendship was deeper than a friendship.Similarly drug addiction was not a topic of deep discussion in the 1920s or 1930s or earlier. Yet it existed. Mark Twain, in his AUTOBIOGRAPHY, mentions Charles Webster, his business partner whose mistakes caused the failure of their publishing house, as addicted to over-the-counter drugs, and states that in America (in the 1890s) it was easy to become a self-poisoner this way. That comment is the sole one I have ever found in 19th Century literature regarding drug addiction, and Twain's Autobiography was not completely published until the 1960s, edited by Charles Neider.The movie record is tricky. I have seen only two films that mention drugs at all. One is Charlie Chaplin's EASY STREET, where the tramp (here a policeman confronting Eric Campbell and his gang in a slum) accidentally sits on a needle with some drug (cocaine, I suspect) and it gives his adrenalin a lift. The other is another Chaplin film (whose title I unfortunately can't recall) wherein somebody is shown using the "notorious nose powders". Leave it to America's greatest writer and the English-born film giant to be the only two who had the guts to discuss the matter.But aside from them there was nothing. No film of stature was made of the trafficking in drugs until TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH...IN THE 1940s! Hard to believe isn't it? Yet we know, if studying the history of organized crime and earlier criminals, that gangs did deal in drugs. It was even then a big business. Capone had a whole section of his empire in Chicago devoted to drug sales, along with prostitution, with illegal booze, and with union racketeering. But it rarely was talked about. Can anyone recall a film with Robinson or Cagney or Raft or Bogart dealing with drugs?The Chinese opium trade was an exception: but it was basically seen as involving Chinese addicts only, not most Americans (a very naive view, but one clung to by most Americans).Now into this hole comes this two-bit film which tries to tackle the threat of drugs to American Youth. It would not be until Samuel Fuller's UNDERWORLD USA in the 1950s that the subject is tackled again so forcefully (Fuller, being a better director, and having Cliff Robertson and Robert Emhart in his cast, does better with the subject). So from want of any alternative, REEFER MADNESS is in a unique position to be notable from the start. It also is lucky to have at least two notable actors. Dave O'Brien is better recalled for the many Pete Smith comedy shorts he did, but his "Ralph" driven crazy to kill another character by reefers is his best remembered performance. Actually, while we realize today that reefers don't do that kind of damage to most people as this film suggests, O'Brien shows by his skittishness and twisting precisely what drug addiction to say cocaine or morphine would do to people - particularly when he is forced into hiding and is somewhat going cold turkey at times. He had done his homework, if the screenwriters did not.The other was Carleton Young. Young would become among the last actors adopted in the John Ford circle in the late 1950s and early 1960s, most notably in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALENCE and SERGEANT RUTLEDGE. Under that master's hands he gave wonderful performances. His performance as the drug dealer Jack Perry is a fair one, given the lesser director he has here. So the film does have some things going for it, even if it over the top in condemning reefers over stronger drugs. I know it is no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it is not the worst film in the world - it's the best bad film of the 1930s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you not love this film? A piece so wonderfully outdated, even young children could get a laugh out of it. Shows how programmed society is to issues such as the use of "marihuana cigarettes".The film makes sense of the whole issue of narcotics, as much sense as anyone could have had on the topic back in the 1930s. The film puts special emphasis on marihuana, the "deadliest of all drugs". This is especially laughable now that people have wised up, and found out that marihuana isn't screwing them up half as good as heroin, crack, blow, or acid can. "Reefer Madness" wants us to tell our children some important facts. Marihuana can make you laugh too much. Sure, according to the film you could also turn into a closet rapist and/or a violent murderer, but the laughing is where the emphasis is put. That's the last thing grown-ups would want teenagers to do back in the 30s is to have a good time.Which brings me to my next point. This whole film looks like one-sided propaganda from the government or some incredibly concerned non-profit organization. In no way am I condoning the use of rec drugs, but the way it's presented gives me my suspicions. Seeing as this film only targeted our good friend cheeba, I'm waiting for sequels! CRACK-COCAINE CRAZY, 'SHROOM PSYCHOSIS, ACID INSANITY, and HEROIN HOE-DOWN! Tell your children!Bottom line here? "Reefer Madness" will bring about more laughs than concerns in this day and age. If you've got a thing for campy classic exposés, or you just really like smokin' the trees, you can't beat this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply poor, nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cindy Collins Smith's review (see above) explains the context of this film very well. I strongly recommend reading it before you read any of the other reviews (including my own - below).'Epically awful' 'full of misinformation' 'a propaganda film which was so ineptly made that it had the opposite of its intended effect.' Much has been written about Reefer Madness and its importance in the history of film-making, so I won't bother to reiterate any of these opinions. Instead, I would like to look at Reefer Madness as a film. How does it rate as a film? Poorly. It has a predictable, uninteresting plot, cardboard cut-out characters, racial stereotypes presented as obvious facts, a stiff script, an unrelentingly plodding pace, and it is very poorly shot. The dramatic points in the plot are so badly acted, scripted and filmed that the film fails to produce any real drama, and the only likable characters in the film are, sadly, the ultimate villains. The editing isn't too bad.IMO, the fact that it was shot with very little budget over a very brief period and was not intended to be taken very seriously does not really help matters much. The low budget shows. Some competent acting talent was squandered. And the film really isn't funny unless you're high! The plot is simple - a clean cut American Boy is given a joint in place of a cigarette and is, from that point forward, spun out of control down the path to lunacy, addiction, and violence. Saying any more would lead to a spoiler, and, just in case any of you are seriously considering watching this film, I wouldn't want to ruin what little entertainment value there is in it. Having stopped experimenting with drugs twenty years ago, I can not imagine anybody even being amused by this film unless they themselves were on drugs. It's simply poor. And poor does not necessarily = funny.Unless a film is particularly artful, I will rate it according to its entertainment value, not necessarily its technique, theory or method. This, for me, is one of those films which does more harm than good - it is neither an effective propaganda piece nor a parody of one, and therefore deserves a single star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my gosh, my post-war generation was still under the influence of this tripe and believed one puff would ruin a lifetime. No wonder the 60's generation talked about a credibility gap as they puffed away. This is a bad movie highlighted by the ridiculous, and no one in front of the camera or behind seems to care. Do the producers really believe this burlesque. Or maybe they're shilling for the liquor lobby then regaining its post-Prohibition popularity, or maybe the plastics lobby worried about the manufacturing possibilities of hemp oil. In a way, it's too bad the movie comes across now as a joke. Pot may not be the Devil's brew, but it does dull awareness, and in that sense remains a risk. So hyping the effects has had a reverse effect that also needs to be considered. Nonetheless, the movie's smug authorities from school principal to courtroom judge to official narrator are enough to get me to light up and puff away. Plus they're not even good for a laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, along with other anti-drug offerings of the time, such as "Marihuana", attempts to warn against a multiple of probable scenarios that result from its usage. The name of the film is a forewarning of content, with an over-dramatization (to the point of silliness) of marijuana effects on the youth of the day.Similar to drinking and driving films of that time, this film focuses on the lives of a handful of high school students, shiny with possibility preyed upon by smartly dressed, sinister adults. Stealthily they are lured into all manner of deprivation and poor choices resulting in tragedy while the dealers cash in and skulk in their silken rat holes.Over the top, and in light of modern knowledge of marijuana usage by even the medical field, this film borders on the side of hilarity due to excessiveness of the stupidity of the victims and iciness of the dealers while hapless parents &amp; teachers scramble for a solution.I recommend it for all to see, if anything as a time capsule view of the norms of the 1930s era of criminal, parent, educator, law enforcement and youth scramble around madly due to lowly reefer as the prime target of propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smoke them, if you got them, because Reefer Madness will make you laugh your head off!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally intended for parents as an educational video against the dangers of marijuana. 'Tell Your Children', AKA 'Reefer Madness', also sometimes titled as 'The Burning Question', 'Dope Addict', 'Doped Youth', and 'Love Madness', was so far-fetch in propaganda and false accusations against the drug that, even Afterschool Specials are pointing and laughing at them. It's a film everybody loves to mock! Directed by Louis Gasnier and produce by Dwain Esper, the exploitation educational film is so extreme with its anti-drug message, that it's hard to believe, that this film was once originally financed by a concerned church group. No really! For a 1930s movie, this movie is intense, due to the large amounts of over-the-top violence and sexuality! Scenes of hit and run accidents, manslaughter, suicide, attempted rape, hallucinations, and descent into madness are all fabricated here, due to marijuana addiction. They really went overboard with this! The side effects portray in this film are highly exaggerated to the point that it's laughable. It's so misinformed. The times has really changed since then. Information about the drug is much more positive than negative. While recreational pot usage is still a controversial topic, many people today agree more with America's new stance on the drug being legal for medical uses. After all, more and more people use it, today, than any other period and clearly, the side effects are not as bad, as they first thought. While, yes, it might cause some people dizziness, loss of time, paranoia, depression, anxiety, increased appetite, low sperm court, birth defects, breathing problems, and others, but also studies show that smoking or chewing pot, can help control cancer, epileptic seizures, eases the pain of multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, Parkinson's disease, and might slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease and arthritis. It's even used for mental health for people suffering from PTSDs, suicide and dementia. It's seem by the amount of research, that I found, the pros outdo the cons. While, nobody should think that drugs are cool. It's just so fun to see just how extreme some people will go to convince us that even the most harmless of drugs are the worst things in the world. I really can't believe that some people still believe that marijuana is more harmful than alcohol or cigarettes. That message is so warped, out of its mind! A good example of that, is from this movie with ad for Pabst's Blue Ribbon Beer being shown during the car chase. Wow! I guess, this movie never heard of drunk-driving, before. It's also disturbing to see the two leads, Bill Harper (Kenneth Craig) and Mary Lane (Dorothy Short), being depicted as incredibly square even for 1930s standards yet they are shown to smoke regular cigarettes, even before they get introduced to pot by the drug pushers, Jack Perry (Carleton Young) and Mae Coleman (Thelma White). What the hell! If you didn't think that, was bad. There is actual cigarette ad in the background! It's a bit irony that both Dorothy Short &amp; Kenneth Craig died years later from some form of cancer. Despite that, the acting is this film was alright, even if they were all acting a bit silly. One character was a bit annoying was Dr. Carroll (Josef Forte). He was such a scene hog. Nevertheless, the plot of the film is also a problem. It was a bit slow. There seem to be a lot of long, pointless shots in the movie, such as Bill dropping his book, picking it up, and dusting it off. Even the opening text takes forever to get through. If that wasn't bad enough, the movie failed so badly at its moral message that it's counterproductive. After all, it might not have been the best idea to start the film by giving detailed instructions on how to make and even smuggle joints. Then, there is the fact that some of the characters in the film, got away with crimes, which is unheard of, in Hays Code 1930s. I think the funniest part, is Jack loudly explaining to Mae, how to frame Billy, while he was in the same room. That was just strange and hokey. It's impossible to take the plot, seriously with all the plot-holes, this film has. If that wasn't bad enough for the film makers and producers. Soon after the film release, the movie lose its copyright claim and since then, belong in the public domain. This means that virtually anyone could duplicate and sell a DVD copy of this. Therefore, many of the versions of this film available on the market are either severely or badly edited. Since many of them, come from extremely poor quality, having been duped from second- or third-generation copies. So don't count on the audio and film footage to be good. Not only that, but it had a lot of scratches, and grains in the film footage. So watch out for that. Even with the film, being over 70 years old. I still have to give some people, credit. The 20th Century Fox, in collaboration with Legend Films, 2004's colorized version was oddly fun to watch. The intentionally unrealistic color schemes add to the film's unintentionally campy humor. I also love how it inspires a 2005's musical satire with the same name. Now that was a blast to watch. Overall: The original black and white movie was alright watch, but it's not as funny as people make it out to be. It's more like an oddities. A freak show, that deserve one viewing and that's all. So check it out. If you like this movie, go ahead and check out, Esper's other works in the education-exploitation field: 1936's 'Marihuana' &amp; 1937's 'Assassin of Youth'. They're also worth the watch. 'Highly' recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Sure What To Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not entirely sure what to make of this movie even after watching it twice- which is about three more chances than I typically give movies that frequent lists of the worst. Usually, back story doesn't matter to me (just read my review of Heaven's Gate as an example), but it would help in this instance. If it was bankrolled by a church group, its wealth would likely put Joel Osteen to shame given the people involved. If it was always to be exploitation, then it has managed to transcend the genre. The acting is more wooden than the Amazon rain forest ever was, the direction (by The Perils of Pauline director Louis Gasnier) is at best static, the plot is way over the top, it distorts the facts royally, and it generally looks cheap. Then again, maybe all of the above- especially its distortion of facts- is the appeal. If it was done intentionally, I personally say, "Bravo." I'm generally not a "bad movie fan" to the degree some seem to be, but I can make an exception here. I'm only giving it a five rating because I don't know if it's supposed to be bad or supposed to be serious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A so bad it's good drug propaganda film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since marijuana (aka pot, weed, grass, puff, Mary Jane, Bob Marley) was banned in the United States, the opponents to this ruling argue that marijuana really has no harmful affect on the human body other than being the equivalent of 4 Nyquil pills (or something like that). Well now you can shut those people up by showing them Reefer Madness an anti drug PSA that was made in the 30s, that actually raises more questions than it answers. With the evil maniacal story of these gangsters that gave the new evil drug to innocent teenagers that made them do horrible things like, run over old men on the streets who shouldn't have been there anyway, or laugh at things that nobody else is. These and many others are the basis that Reefer Madness uses to support it's argument. Reefer Madness is a film so exaggerated that it doesn't even feel serious. I know this was a different time but even in the 1930s this seemed over playing it. If you're a police officer looking for a good PSA to show kids then you'll have to look somewhere else. But if you're looking for a movie to make fun of, then Reefer Madness is a good choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahh, good old fashioned American 1930s propaganda, a world where ignorance and misinformation can live in blissful harmony and there isn't an opposing point of view to offend the eye. There were thousands of such films in the 30s (several of which I've seen) most of which were aimed at young teens to deter them from a life that includes such scourges as alcohol and drugs but also such hedonistic crimes as jazz music and short skirts. You see how well it worked.Realizing that prohibition didn't work, doctors and scientists of the time tried to make proof positive that young folks didn't fall into the traps of such devilish delights as jazz, liquor, sex and dancing, all of which was believed to have spun off from the briefest exposure to marijuana. There were thousands of these movies with one bizarre title after another such as Why it's Named Dope, The Dope on Dope, Pot is only for Cooking, Say Nope to Dope and the great Marihuana, the Weed with Roots to Hell! (That's the one where the girl carrying the Bible walks into a pot party, instantly gets high and jumps out a 40-story window). But the most insane of the bunch is Reefer Madness, a dated propaganda film made in 1937 that is so bad it gained a cult following.I am not, it should be said, an advocate for the legalization of marijuana. I do not believe that making it legal will solve the problem. I do however find this movie's point of view very curious. It not only sees marijuana as an epidemic but a plague, a holocaust, a vicious and vile subverted mass devil possession that once it gets it's claws into you can only lead to a violent and ugly demise for which the pits of Hell await you. And that's just for the first puff.The movie opens with a crawl that explains that marijuana is - The Real Public Enemy Number ONE!! - it further explains that the symptoms of the drug include "sudden violent uncontrollable laughter then some dangerous hallucinations - space expands - times slows almost . . . fixed". Then we are taken to a very ugly looking school principal named Dr. Carroll who stands before the PTA and bellows about the scourge, reminding us of every conceivable hiding place from shoe heels to watch cases to the inseams of sports jackets (curiously, he fails to mention pockets).He further goes on to explain how the federal government knows how to identify the substance and that if it is found, they dispose of it. How? "Recently in Brooklyn" he tells us "an acre of marijuana field was found the by federal agents who wrapped it up and threw it into a nearby incinerator." He fails to mention however that throwing 200 pounds of marijuana into a public furnace might not be such a hot idea.His exhaustive example falls on the heads of Bill and Mary, two white bred teens in the 1930s that not only look impervious to a life of crime but are, in fact, so perfectly innocent that they might not be quite sure what a life of crime actually is.Bill is a clean cut American lad. He salutes the flag, he drinks his milk, his suit is pressed and if he were any stiffer he'd have rigor mortis. He's the perfect American 30s male, white, toothy, ready for a life of patriarchal rule and inanities such as "A man is the king of his castle, and "I'm putting my foot down." Mary isn't much better in her cotton dress, her pointed brassiere, her Dorothy McGuire hairstyle and her perfectly perfect perfect face. These two wouldn't DARE leave the house without partaking of mother's big, fat greasy breakfast.One day, on the way home from school, Bill is enticed by Mae and Jack, a couple of weed wackos to go to their apartment for a little party. He likes the stuff and keeps going back where he makes nice with Blanche and Ralph, slaves to the dope. One of the best scenes involves a girl, joint in mouth, playing the piano and a paranoid Ralph yelling, "Faster! Faster!" until finally she's playing a frenzied solo.Bill's problems begin one day he after one puff of a very potent joint and beds down with *gasp* a girl! Meanwhile Mary tracks him down but falls for the old cigarette switch and is suddenly giggling like a school girl while Ralph, a wide-eye lunatic with rings under he eyes, tries to make time with her. When she resists and begins screaming, Bill runs out, still under the influence of the evil weed, hallucinates and blacks out at the same time and Jack accidentally shoots Mary.Jack pins the blame on Bill, who is convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Only Ralph and Blanche know the truth, and they're stowed away in Jack's apartment for the duration of the trial, with a piano and the mother lode of weed.The best scene in the movie happens at Bill's trial where Dr. Carroll gets time for more chin music. He explains that he can tell Bill was using the dangerous drug because he seemed to exhibit symptoms of a "disassociation of ideas" (that's the first time that I've ever heard of drugs begin blamed for a person becoming creatively bankrupt). I can understand a movie that is dated beyond all reason but Reefer Madness brings it to a fever pitch, especially when dolling out such nuggets of information as the idea that a young man playing tennis "missed the ball by three or four feet".Next Wimbledon, these eyes are wide open!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black and white, 1930's film exaggerating the use of marijuana.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very funny, exaggerative, yet informing film on how society classified marijuana use in the first of half of the century. When the characters in this movie smoke marijuana, they react extremely, killing others, and acting completely insane. This movie also portrays the use of reefer as an addictive act, and directly stresses that marijuana be kept away from our youth (as defined by a scene in which an adolescent school-boy smokes marijuana at an apartment jazz party, finds his girlfriend being taken advantage of by another man who is acting marijuana-crazed, and then gets blamed for shooting them). This movie is a complete contrast to the way marijuana use is commonly viewed today. Like previously stated, it exaggerates the use of this drug purposely to be used as a scare-tactic to society of that time period. I would give this movie a 7.0 based on humorous portrayals, classification information, and comedic depiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hysterical Hokum About Marihuana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, the road to success for a film can be circuitous. The anti-marijuana film "Reefer Madness" bears this distinction. Initially, in 1936, a small religious organization bankrolled it as "Tell Your Children" with a moral message about the wages of smoking pot. Notorious exploitation film maestro Dwain Esper forged a reputation with exploitation films, including "Narcotic" (1933), "Maniac" (1934), and "Marihuana" (1936). Esper got his mitts on it, inserted additional footage, and changed the title to "Reefer Madness." Esper toured the exploitation circuit with "Reefer Madness" and made a bundle. Afterward, "Reefer Madness" and thousands of similar exploitation titles languished. In 1971, founder of NORML (Nation Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws), Keith Stroup bought a copy from the Library of Congress for $297 and started showing it a pro-marijuana parties. Ironically, designed originally to discourage marijuana usage, the same film had been appropriated as part of a campaign to make the idea of forbidden pot looks as archaic and old-fashioned as this campy bromide. At best, "Reefer Madness" qualifies as undistinguished hokum."Reefer Madness" opens with a foreword brimming with bombast. "The motion picture you are about to witness may startle you. It would not have been possible, otherwise, to sufficiently emphasize the frightful toll of the new drug menace which is destroying the youth of America in alarmingly increasing numbers. Marihuana is that drug--a violent narcotic--an unspeakable scourge--the Real Public Enemy Number One! Its first effect is sudden, violent, uncontrollable laughter; then come dangerous hallucinations--space expands--time slows down, almost stands still--fixed ideas come next, conjuring up monstrous extravagances--followed by emotional disturbances, the total inability to direct thoughts the loss of all power to resist physical emotions . . . Leading finally to acts of shocking violence . . . Ending often in incurable insanity. In picturing its soul destroying effects no attempt was made to equivocate. The scenes and incidents, while fictionalized for the purposes of this story, are based upon actual research into the results of Marihuana addiction. If their stark reality will make you think, will make you aware that something must be done to wipe out this ghastly menace, then the picture will not have failed in its purpose . . . . Because the dread Marihuana may be reaching forth next for your son or daughter or yours . . . . Or YOURS! "Reefer Madness" opens and closes with crusading Lakeside High School Principal Dr. Carroll (Joseph Forte of "Pals of the Saddle") addressing concerned adults at a Parent Teachers Organization. This bespectacled high school educator advocates the classes about narcotics so youth will not become victims of addiction. Chiefly, he rages about marijuana. He argues vociferously that the dreadful narcotic will destroy future generations. Dr. Carroll recalls a past incident that encapsulates the devastation that marihuana leaves in its wake. The plot concerns drug peddling at the street level. Aside from some documentary footage, "Reefer Madness" exhibits no actual marihuana. The cigarettes--or 'reefers' as they call them--are twisted up into paper cylinders ready to be smoked. The movie presents us with three of the drug dealers: all white, middle-aged, well-dressed, and clean-cut. Jack works with Mae Coleman (Thelma White of "What Price Jazz"), in an apartment near a high school. Jack (Carleton Young of "The Horse Soldiers") entertains kids with marijuana. Mae abhors the idea of exploiting these kids. "Oh," moans Jack, "why don't you get over that mother complex!" Another dealer, Pete Dally (Richard Alexander of "Modern Times"), has a low opinion about the distributor, Joe, and Jack preying on the youngsters.Enter squeaky clean, upright Bill (Kenneth Craig) who is friends with Mary. They do their home work together and drink hot chocolate at her parent's house. They recite Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet." Bill meets Jack and Ralph on the street near Mary's parked white convertible car. Mary's younger brother Jimmy (Warren McCullum of "Boys' Reformatory") is ensconced in the back seat. He gets promptly hooked on weed. One day while give Jack a lift, Jimmy runs a red light, and strikes a pedestrian with his car as he makes a right-hand turn. Jimmy races away from the scene of the accident. By now, Dr. Carroll is concerned about Bill's academic tailspin. Blanche (Lillian Miles of "The Gay Divorcée") accompanies Bill to Mae's place. Not long afterward, she fires up Bill's first marihuana cigarette. After the police visit the Lane residence, Mary goes looking for Jimmy. She obtains directions to Mae's, and an ardent Ralph greets her at the door. Ralph has been admiring Mary from afar. Running off another couple, he sees this as the perfect opportunity. Ralph gets Mary stoned and tries to take advantage of her. Bill leaves Blanche and stumbles in Ralph and Mary. He hallucinates. Instead of seeing Mary defend herself from Ralph's unwanted advances, Bill sees Mary taking down her top for a lascivious Ralph. Bill and Ralph fight each other. Jack separates them by clobbering Ralph with a revolver. Now, Bill and Jack struggle. Jack's gun discharges and the bullet strikes Mary and kills her! Jack makes it look like Bill shot Mary and warns Ralph and Blanche to keep their mouths shut.Meanwhile, Bill finds himself in court, and Ralph goes insane hiding out at Mae's apartment. In court, Dr. Carroll attributes Bill's violent behavior to cannabis. Ralph kills Jack with his fists, and the authorities arrest him, along with Mae and Blanche. Blanche clears poor Bill of Mary's murder, but she commits suicide. As "Reefer Madness" concludes, Dr. Carroll warns parents that they might suffer some similar fate if they grow lax in their vigilance. Meanwhile, presumably the filmmakers forgot about Jimmy. He is never brought to trial for the hit and run accident. Everything about "Reefer Madness" is hysterical. The filmmakers are acquainted with only the basics, and rely on exaggeration when they depict the consequences of the abuse marihuana by youth. "Reefer Madness" is an acclaimed example of inferior filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a load of propaganda b.s. could only be a product of the isolationist, narrow-minded decade of the 1930's &amp; the great depression. Put together by tobacco executives who felt that the market for cannabis threatened their tobacco crops, the film shows ordinary teenagers who go crazy on marijuana, laughing hysterically &amp; running over people with their cars. In once scene a bureaucrat points to a cabinet full of crimes related to marijuana &amp; describes one where a girl butchered her entire family. Anyone who knows anything about pot knows that it's one of the few substances that can actually calm down a homicidal murderer.I saw the film as a comedy, because it really is ridiculous. The sound quality is terrible - besides the somewhat muted voices you can hear what sounds like a projector reel running in the background. Also the acting is second-rate at best. But, if you're in the mood for some 1930's tobacco propaganda, this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Propaganda in the US media, what else is new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I'd like to make a quick short comment about the movie. Reefer Madness is a movie who's humor you will not fully understand in all its ridiculousness unless you are high or have at least smoked marijuana at some time in your life. You can get an idea about it, but not the full idea. Reefer Madness is actually a little boring to watch it straight. The movie has an ironic humor with an historical context that some people may not understand. The irony exists in the expected results of the film as a scare tactic and the actual results of the movie which brought marijuana to the curiosity of the public masses and made the drug counter-culture more popular. It is curious to note that after Reefer Madness was released, the Motion Pictures Association banned the representation of any narcotics in films. Originally made as a tool in J.Edgar Hoovers war on drug users, alcoholics, and homosexuals, Reefer Madness is still used as a tool in some drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities in spite of it's propaganda.The rest of this is about history and may sound a bit like a conspiracy theory rambling, but it's really just a bit of a brain storm. I have a general idea about the historical context of the film and I do believe that it has a great deal of importance for the reasons why the movie was made in the way that it was. I believe it has something to say about the administration of the time and how the way of thinking has transcended to the present day. For anyone interested in history read on. I only have a general understanding. I'm not an historian.The 1930's were a time of economical hardship due to the Great Depression. The movie was made just after the 21st amendment which terminated prohibition. Alcohol was legalized and there were fears that other vices might also be tolerated as a result. There was concern about communism spreading at that time. This was known as the red scare, which had been an issue since the Russian Revolution of 1918. After the turn of the 20th century there was a large increase in Mexican immigration. During that time, the Mexicans brought the marijuana with them and introduced it to the states. Pot was not introduced into the American culture until the Mexicans traveled north with it. Cocaine, opium, and heroin were the drugs of the day before marijuana was really known. It could be found in sodas, throat lozenges, and other medicines. The Mexican immigrants were considered to be an "inferior race" at that time and they lived in the ghetto immigrant communities where violence and alcoholism were common. In white America deviant behavior such as alcoholism and drug use were feared to be the cause of the deterioration of traditional American values along with homosexuality and of course the ever present evil of communism. Social and political instability were threats in the American psyche in the 1930's. Subversive tactics such as propaganda were employed. The media has always been used as a weapon in the war on drugs which began with J.Edgar Hoover and his newly created FBI which was formed to combat the feared Marxist movement and other counter-culture movements. Lists of names and files were made. Many people were falsely arrested in the name of national security. This began a period of action analogous to the Salem witch hunt of the late 17th century. These tactics have been employed throughout the McCarthy era in which Julius and Ethyl Rosenberg were executed by the government for allegations that they disclosed nuclear secrets to the soviets during World War 2. From what I understand, the Russians were allies of the US during World War 2 and the Rosenbergs passed on information about airplane propellers. Maybe there's something that I don't understand, but that to me isn't a capital crime. For some reason, however, the American government was allowed to murder these 2 people and shame and orphan their children forever. The propaganda of the government has continued to pervade the American society in different ways at different times throughout history. The most current example I can think of is the release of the last 10 pages of the files that were held by the FBI on John Lennon and his alleged involvement in the Communist movement which were finally disclosed last week. The report was held for reasons of national security for no reason because there was nothing substantial that would have made him a threat to anything.Although I do think that Reefer Madness is hilarious and I believe it is good that we can all find the humor in the movie, it is at the same time an embarrassment to see the wasted energy and corruption of an elected government that I believe the people of this country should be able to have confidence in and be able to believe in. Perhaps the so called deterioration of traditional American values has been in itself a MacCarthyism. Nothing but spoon fed suspicion which has been given credence without substantial evidence in order to gain some ulterior motive. In the words of Aesop, "We hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to office."</fullReview>

Teaching in this instance being synonymous with propaganda. Calling this flick "highly exaggerated" or "over the top" is putting it mildly. Which is exactly why, given the very pronounced change in society's view of marijuana, it is so much fun and rightly deserves the title "Cult Classic". Well done? Hardly. Fun? Oh yes. So ...

And not just your typical heroin or anything, but something far more dangerous; marijuana. As the American enemy No 1, it makes you burst out in laughter, a lousy driver and a really bad tennis player apparently.In the midst are a couple of dealers who lure none-suspected teens into their appartment to sell them the drugs.

But oh my, there's a struggle there and she gets shot by mean dealer-guy and owner of the apartment, Jack, who makes sure not he but drugged up Bill is taken for the killer.All is decided in court where things work out just in time for Billy boy as the true killer is exposed (well, he was already dead at the time anyway). But let this be a lesson for you boy!30's propaganda movie is silly of course, but underneath the (many, obvious and mostly hilarious) faults there's a decent story told here... a movie everybody should see, for various reasons.5/10.</fullReview>

Although it was relatively short, I found it boring at times and wished there could have been less moralising and more scenes of drug-taking and partying. After reading all the hype, I was disappointed that it just wasn't camp enough!The owner of the reefer-house is blonde Mae (perhaps a scandlous nod to Mae West here, who was seen as the devil by the moral minority at the time). A group of teenagers (in a time before the concept of teenagers was properly invented) hang out there, to play the piano at ultra-high speed, dance with each other badly, make-out (generally off-screen) and smoke Mary-Jane. (One of the other female characters is interestingly called Mary). They hardly ever inhale.While there are a couple of sensible messages here - i.e. it's probably best not to drive a car while under the influence, the moralising is so heavy-handed, and statements that tell us that marijauna is more dangerous than heroin and cocaine from so-called experts are just counter-productive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I learned a lot watching Reefer Madness (AKA Teach Your Children...hey did you know that the CSN song "Teach Your Children" is also also known as "Reefer Madness?" Small world, huh?). Amongst the points I learned, marijuana is a dangerous narcotic (actually narcotics are specific type of drug that includes opiates...oh well). Also, it can produce fits of horrible violence, and near incurable insanity. It's a good thing I don't do drugs, but even if I did this movie would have scared me straight.I hear conflicting reports whether this movie was made as propaganda, or simply as a piece of trash meant to cash in on 1930s drug paranoia. Either way, it's a pretty inaccurate and humourous look at the effects of marijuana on some rather dumb teenagers. Besides the rather loose and fast rules about drugs (Calling marijuana more dangerous than heroin for example), the producers also tend to have difficulty with things like suspense and continuity.Perhaps the film was actually presenting that of an alternate reality, one in which marijuana really can drive a person nuts, not to the refrigerator. That would explain a few of the gaffes in the film, like the time when the car runs over the human at top speed, leaving neither the car nor the human with any visible physical injury. Or the time when a character is shot from across the room (in the back) by two men struggling on the ground with the gun. Even the Warren Comission wouldn't have bought that trajectory. And my very favorite moment of the film, when a woman leaps out of a high window, the old woman she's walking with has to run to the window and look down before reacting in horror. Cause, you know, she might have landed on a flag pole or something.Then again, maybe this wasn't an alternate reality. Maybe the filmmakers were the ones all hopped up and they decided to goof around with the camera for 70 odd minutes. In any event, "Reefer Madness" will definitely teach your children that it is made by people who clearly had very little information on their subject, or how to make a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this film, I had expected it to be just an hour of lies about MJ. Instead there was an interesting plot and fine acting and directing, and not too much about the harmful effects of MJ, which probably weren't known yet. However the film failed to realize that by making the drug harder to get, huge industries would form around the smuggling and prolification of the drug. Many thousands of people would be shot to death or put in jail or sentenced to life in the slums by the war on drugs. I guess Johnny America doesn't care about the lower classes or freedom. Vote Libertarian to end the pointless war on drugs. Finally, the movie does show a good window into early filmmaking, with whitebread America in center focus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What really surprised me the most about this 1936, low-budget expose revealing the menace of marijuana was to find out how prevalent pot smoking actually was amongst the American youth of the day.I mean, it was such an issue in the mid-1930s that it had reached the point of being a nationwide concern.With marijuana being labelled as "Public Enemy #1", this film's re-enactment of "real" events (taken from FBI files on delinquency, no less) were so bad that they were, more often than not, enjoyably entertaining and, yes, even funny (especially since this picture took its subject matter so dead-seriously).From marijuana turning even good girls bad, to attempted rape while under the influence, to hit'n'run recklessness, Reefer Madness's high-flying highlight was its star pothead, Ralph Wiley, who goes totally berserk after smoking one potent marijuana cigarette after another.You really have to see Dave O'Brien's laughable performance as Wiley for yourself to believe it.All-in-all - If you can appreciate Reefer Madness from a strictly nostalgic point of view, then I'm sure you'll find it to be worthwhile entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Things are different down at the malt shop in small town lily white America. Seems some surly gents are turning kids on with mind altering Mary Jane aka marijuana. The iniquitous soul stealing substance popular among urban hep cat Negroes and sex crazed Mexicans is making its final push into the white suburban middle class targeting its children. Before our eyes we see kids as fine as a May morning degenerate into crazed lunatics with uncontrollable appetites for nostalgie de la boue. Reckless behavior follows and comic scenes of debauchery ensue as the kids get existential, craving faster music, driving recklessly and becoming overtly more lustful. It all comes to a head when sweet Mary finds herself compromised by a craven Bogarter and then murdered. Law and order ultimately sets things straight but not before a guilt ridden member of the dealers haunted by flashbacks jumps through a ten story window to her death. This cautionary tale of blatant lies and unintentional hilarity about demon weed is one of the first broad sides in the war on drugs. Amateurishly and clumsily patched together with sensationalistic blather and mad tokers it irresponsibly condemns what would turn out to be a medicinal panacea used by millions. Having extensively researched and observed the herb in use during my college years I found none of the deleterious effects dramatized in the film. On the contrary I found among colleagues a more subdued good natured mood fueling a penchant to consume vast quantities of carbohydrates (as well as a more restrained appreciation of sex and music). By ignoring this "munchies" factor Tell Your Children loses a golden opportunity to dramatize and publicize the greater threat that faces this country-obesity. But in its day these insipid ravings allowed then kinda drug czar Harry Anslinger to develop a cottage industry to employ jobless revenue agents who lost their meal ticket with the end of Prohibition. They needed a demon and found it in a benign plant that could avoid being regulated and taxed and was pervasive among second class (Blacks and Latinos) citizens who were already being institutionally abused of their rights. When it crept into white society films like Tell Your Children warned of the impending apocalypse. It must have worked because the disaster thus far has been averted. But as the stern narrator soberly warned we must remain vigilant. Pass the Hagen Daz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this after taping it from an episode of IFC Grindhouse. It was so boring that I could barely stay awake watching it. Maybe it was because I have never smoked pot and never will that it didn't work for me on any level. It wasn't effective as propaganda or unintentional camp. I fast-forwarded it at some points just because I wanted to get to the ending.Aside from the fact that I have never smoked pot and never will, maybe the fact that I saw it 72 years after it was made would explain why I found zero entertainment value. I applaud Dwain Esper for his hard work keeping the movie Freaks out of obscurity, but this movie just stunk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horrible Tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know there are some movies that are so bad they're funny. "Plan Nine From Outer Space." They needn't be old or cheap either. John Wayne's "The Conquerer" is right up there in the first rank of the fifth rate. I think what we tend to forget, between viewings, is that bad movies are also extremely dull. And after a first viewing, prompted by curiosity twenty years ago, this one was a real caution to sit through a second time. I can truthfully say it's worse than having a colonoscopy, but then I LIKE colonoscopies.Briefly, mercifully, I'll keep the plot short. Good old Bill Harper (Kenneth Craig) is a high school kid, "a fine upstanding American young man," according to his principal (Joseph Forte, in one of the most execrable performances ever committed to celluloid). Fine, upstanding Bill reluctantly finds himself attending reefer parties held in an apartment owned by a gang that includes Carlton Young and Dave O'Brien. Aficionados of John Ford's mature movies will recognize Carlton Young, but you have to be knee deep into an obsession with the short comedies of the 1940s to recognize Dave O'Brien.Anyway, nature takes its natural course. Young Bill joins the others in their intoxication, neglects his upstanding young girl friend, Mary, takes up with a sleazy blond, learns to enjoy doing wild dances, and is framed for the accidental shooting death of Mary.Nobody involved in the production could have had the slightest idea of what marijuana is or does. They may have gotten their ideas from Cecil's Textbook of Medicine or someplace -- symptoms of cannabis intoxication include high pulse rate, rising blood pressure, compulsive laughter, impaired judgment, euphoria, sluggishness, and so forth. (They left out the munchies.) A snap of the surgically scrubbed fingers and, voil?, it's not a high at all, it's a disease.The writers scripted in some additional symptoms, for the sake of their dramatic purport, I suppose. Reefers also make you snappish and angry. They prompt you to hold up stores. They drive you insane, as they did Dave O'Brien. They lead you to drive too fast and too recklessly, so that you tend to run over innocent pedestrians. That last symptom bespeaks a high level of imagination; most drivers intoxicated by cannabis are likely to drive too slowly and to begin applying the brakes while the Stop sign is still a quarter of a mile away. They're burning up the road until they look down at the speedometer and realize they're traveling at 35 miles an hour. (So I've been told.)Well, in 1936, hardly anyone had had any exposure to marijuana and this film was designed to be educational in the vulgar sense. It's easy to generate hysteria in a crowd by slipping them disinformation about the unknown. If it's not marijuana, it's internet predators, Satanists, UFOs, Illuminati, masturbation/insanity or something else. These kinds of fomenters of fear reach our more primitive subcortical structures. The fear is, for good reason, hard wired in our brains and sits there waiting for its trigger to be pulled. Since most of what we have to fear now, as opposed to when we lived in caves, consists of symbols that pose no immediate physical threat, we seem compelled to pull make-believe triggers from time to time. We wind up with a false fear, or what psychologists call "an arousal jag." This movie is a good example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cautionary Drug Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This well-meaning but truly awful drug tale was ahead of its time in warning the public on the dangers of smoking cannabis. Modern Emergency Room doctors have noted that some of their patients who come to them with psychotic or other mental conditions do, in fact, smoke dope.The active ingredient in marijuana is a natural insecticide that the marijuana plant creates to defend itself from insect attack. Too bad people don't get the message and leave it alone.If you poison your brain long enough, it won't work right. When the brain is poisoned, rather than expressing the problem as pain, it sometimes produces euphoria.As for the film, people tend to imitate what they see. In that sense, showing scenes of attractive young people smoking dope was not helpful. Nor were the scenes of exaggerated effects produced by marijuana. It takes time for the deleterious effects of smoking dope to become evident. The film itself was boring and like watching a filmed stage play with few reaction shots. At times it took on an almost clinical air, and it is too bad that moderns find it amusing.Having met mentally ill people who freely admit that they fried their brains on drugs, I didn't find this film very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tell Your Children......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing we're confronted with is three minutes and twenty eight seconds of absolutely no dialog. The first minute and sixteen seconds of the movie is comprised of titles and credits over a green card background, while listening to the Best of the Retirement Home Quartet. You can skip the next minute and forty seconds. It comprises the bull-crap government discourse on the subject of marijuana.If you decide not to heed my advice, you will be subjected to a rolling series of titles telling you about the dangers (???) of marijuana, while listening to Volume 2 of the Retirement Home Collection.After a brief homage to Dziga Vertov's The Man with a Movie Camera (not intentional), some suit with glasses (in a classroom) is telling some PTA-like organization to unite and burn out (choice-term) the hemp epidemic. We are given a creepy first person angle of this along with a strange pronunciation of "bureau". We get an education into narcotics, especially failed concealment techniques (not to be used), identifying different forms of narcotics and some destruction techniques for large quantities of illicit substances (which you can now identify with ease). Dr. Carrol (as he refers to himself) tells us a story about an apartment near a nondescript high school where Mae Colman (along with her two "friends" Jack Smokes Too Much and Ralph Eats Too Much : a.k.a The Reefer Recruiters) "entertain".This is where this docu-drama turns into a peep show as we a watch a long shot of Mae putting on her stockings and a dress. The movie delves into the depraved "parties" at Mae's place. Unfortunately, most of the mid-twenty year old teenagers are pretty boring people before they smoke. Afterwards, they seem more "NORML". The biggest problem of the movie is the reality that is being attempted. It is completely unbelievable. None of the people actually inhale. Reefer is being portrayed as a terrible thing, yet everyone looks happy and seem to be having a good time. The problems arise from the "teenagers" association with unsavory characters. I think this is most likely due to the illegal nature of marijuana. One could even say that it is a case of catch-22 or chicken and the egg syndrome. The conflict portion of the story occurs when at one party, Jack and Mae run out of reefer. Jack asks one of the kids (Jimmy) to give him a ride to get more. On the way back, Jimmy Quite So High runs over an old man crossing the street. This brings the "man" down and the stress increases. The rest is rather boring and predictable. Chock full of excitement like : a fight, death, trials, coconut sound effects, line flubbing, Jimmy Stewart impressions (Mary.... Mary ...), bad piano playing, lots of uncoordinated dancing, and even more crazy piano playing. The movie is so absurd and ridiculous that it can't help but be comical. Without the marijuana, the movie on its own is as follows : the acting is atrocious, the dialog is ridiculous, the sets are flimsy and the plot is nonexistent. This in no way should discourage anyone from seeing this movie at least once. Try and get an idea of what our elected representatives once (still??) thought about this innocuous little weed. My last piece of advice is to watch the digitally-colored version of the movie with the Mike Nelson commentary. This provides some much needed stimulus on a very dull and drab movie. Watch the black and white version for nostalgic purposes only. Never, ever watch this movie alone. Watch it with at least one friend. If you can't find one, definitely turn on the Mike Nelson commentary track. He'll make you feel like you are watching it together. When you do watch with actual people, try and create various games (involving cards, alcohol, twister or whatever else you have on hand) to entertain you through the 65 minutes of drabness.-Celluloid Rehab</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE WITHOUT THE COMMENTARY FROM MIKE NELSON. "Reefer Madness" is a 1930's propaganda film where parents of a small town community hold a hearing about the dangers of marijuana. Which back then was apparently spelled marihuana. A straight-laced boy tests out weed for the first time. It, of course, changes everything about him. He alienates everyone around him. Eventually killing a man. He goes deeper and deeper into the underbelly of society and is arrested for murder. This movie by itself is one of the worst ever. With its "ultracolor" effects that create blue, orange, purple, and green smoke. Also, take in to account the horrible plot line and absurd idea of the movie itself. However, the DVD with commentary from "Mystery Science Theatre 3000" alum Mike Nelson is pretty good. It definitely makes the movie watchable. Also, check out the special feature entitled Grandpa's Marijuana handbook (or something to that effect). It's not as good as the feature presentation but it's good for a few laughs. Beware: It does drag on a little.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just seen "Reefer Madness" for the first time, and I must say that it was hilarious. One scene that was memorable for me was when Mary got shot. How could that happen when Bill and Jack (please correct me if I got the names wrong) were struggling on the floor and she was on the couch? As far fetched as some of this movie was, I found it very amusing (and no, I'm not high as I type this!)This movie appears to be a public service vehicle to keep kids from "marihuana". Marijuana (the producers of this film would probably pronounce the proper spelling "Mare-ah-joo-wanna) is a dangerous drug, but not nearly as dangerous as crack, cocaine and many other drugs. I've never heard of a case of anyone that has smoked weed starting to dance as badly as these characters were. I was born in 1974, so I guess I had to be there.Overall, a pretty entertaining film, if nothing else. It won't go down in film history as the greatest film of all time, but it did make me laugh!</fullReview>

Now I do not have kids, but I would guess they would be scratching their heads after this was over. I know because I was scratching my head. the story is nothing more then people smoking weed....A lot of it. Every other scene they are having a party and smoking marijuana -- or Marihuana as the movie spells it. The people in the movie really need help. From five minute scrolling text at the beginning of the movie, to the final THE END at the end of the movie. There is really nothing special about this movie. they go so far as to say that marijuana will drive you to murder, rape, and even insanity. Though I have never heard of people doing anything of these things. Now if it was cocaine, or heroin, or speed, I could understand that. But murder(?) The acting is ridiculous. Even for a 30's movie. No one is convincing in their roles, and they never make you want to care about them. Or maybe this was the whole point of the movie -- not to care about the characters. As this is a heavy anti-marijuana movie and that might have been the whole point.If you want to really see this movie, get the new restored color version on DVD. It has a hilarious commentary by Mike Nelson on it. The smoke from the marijuana is a barrage of different colors too. It's pretty strange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, we CAN point out the glaring overstatements made by this movie. IE: pot leads to insanity and hardcore addiction. But remember, at the time this film was made people hadn't used marijuana like they do today. It was used mostly as medicinal just like cocaine was used until the early 1900's as medical treatment, yet the effects weren't entirely known. So it was sensationalized to keep the rising number of smokers from rising even greater.What we have in Reefer isn't an actual documentary or accurate scientific study. It's propaganda and what many fans consider early grindhouse. At the time this was a scandal. Until this period subjects such as sex, drugs, and rebellion weren't common in mainstream movies. The fact that Reefer even got off the ground, let alone a great cult classic, is a wonder. The crappy overdone acting, the tragic woe-is-me twist, amazingly cheap setup, and obvious gaffs are what make it great.Reefer opened the doors to other marijuana shock movies as well as a slew of "warning" movies exploring everything from heroine, alcohol, and even dancing.</fullReview>

I have always felt that movies with historical or cultural value deserve recognition for this, independent of production values.Because this movie was overtly intended to portray a realistic view of marijuana users, and failed so miserably, it stands as a prized cultural artifact of an era when official marijuana propaganda reflected tabloid sensationalism, as opposed to any actual knowledge of marijuana's physical and social effects. For an in-depth examination of the ways that American propaganda has changed through the decades, I found the documentary "Grass" (narrated by celebrity activist Woody Harrelson) to be a valuable and trustworthy source, despite its obvious pro-marijuana bias.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just re-watched this movie after a twenty-year hiatus, I have to say that it still stands up as one of the most egregiously erroneous films ever made. Sure, it has low production values--after all, it WAS a propaganda film--and sure, the acting is over the top. But the really amusing part of the film for us (with more modern information) is the super-dramatized falsehoods regarding the drug, which THEY refer to as a "narcotic"! Since a summary of the film's main plot and great moments of illogic already exist on this sight, I will simply say that, other than those scary 1950s health films, there are precious few films out there that can compare to this one in the general field of misinformation.That being said, to us, of course, this is a laugh-riot, well worth one's time to at least view it once. Anyone who has seen this film, which was clearly meant to cash in on the post-illegalization of marijuana, will surely find the Ralph character's stoned antics to be hilariously campy and the Bill character's everything to be alarmingly wooden. (Unnatural extremes of acting were apparently the order of the day for the director, who was probably laughing while making this tripe, imagining that he was going to make a bundle off it eventually.) The frenzied piano scene while the ringleader Mae is puffing on a joint is also a crowd favorite.However, the deliciously weird dialogue is what really "sells" the film: nonsensical gems and "cautionary" pearls of wisdom abound. Thankfully, writing THIS bad doesn't come around all that often. And pay close attention to the seemingly endless scene between Bill and his kid brother about a non-functioning model airplane--it seems to have no point at all to the storyline or the message of the film, but the kid is cute and precocious in that 1930s sort of way.Although the film has its moments, true enjoyment will come if it is shared with a friend, since you just HAVE to comment! And no, you do not have to be high when viewing it, but twenty years ago...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad film that misses its aim of education by being heavily slanted, but judging it by today's standards is a bit unfair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High school principle Dr Carroll is so concerned about the drugs menace that he gives a lecture to parents on the risks the demon weed poses. After a discussion of how the weed is produced and rolled and where it comes from, Dr Carroll stresses that the rumours on the impact of weed is not scare mongering but an established fact. To illustrate his point he tells a story of several kids right there in their own town. Bill and Mary were wholesome high school kids from happy families with good futures; however when bill gets invited to a party, he takes an innocent puff on a joint ? his first of what would become many. Meanwhile, Mary's casual experimentation sees her sexually assaulted on her first puff, sending Bill in a violent rage with deadly consequences.Unlike many other viewers on this site, I did not deliberately turn to this film to have ironic laughs at it but more out of interest. I had seen clips of this film played in modern documentaries (Grass for example) and easily derided and, in fairness, it is easy to do because they are dated and rather corny but just to watch it with an agenda to mock it is to do the film (and yourself) a disservice. It is easy to forget that this was one of many attempts to control drug use in the 1930's, the Government turned to movies as part of trying to educate the public. Looking at it now of course, the film is pretty extreme in its depiction of the consequences but it does show the good side of drugs, the feelings that it gives you etc but the consequences for every user will not be as extreme as this film tries to portray as the norm for even an one-time casual user; like Bill Hicks said 'never robbed nobody, never shot nobody, never lost one single job. Laughed my *ss off, and went about my day' (I'm paraphrasing).In terms of its value as a film, it is of course pretty weak. The direction is OK but the production values are low even for the period; some shots are really badly lit, the film crackles and jumps around a lot due to frequent dropped frames and the soundtrack cuts in and out quite badly. The acting is also only average; it would be easy to criticise the actors for how quickly they take their characters from clean cut down to junkies but that is not their fault ? they were only doing what they were told and I did think that they did do an OK job all things considered. However, any vague acting talent is hidden behind some truly awful dubbing/lip synching ? I would give it too much of a kicking but suffice to say that Godzilla movies have better dialogue tracks than this film. Let's not forget though, that this is not a movie ? it is an educational film and even today the production values and acting within educational films is still pretty dire; the last one I was a short film on confined space entry with William Shatner ? hardly a piece of art!This film opens with hope ? it starts with a discussion of the drugs as to their content and production; this is better than I expected. However from this point onwards facts and figures go out the window in favour of an extreme story of depravity and perversion; the nearest the film gets to interest statistics is where the police chief vaguely says he used to fill small folders with drug related crimes, now he fills filing cabinets (I think mothers in the audience were supposed to faint at this point). The film really overdoes it and it is a shame. People who mock it for being the worst possible case ignore the fact that other drug users in the film get off without these same consequences, but I do get their point ? there aren't any 'normal' users who get high on a weekend with friends! Also, the fate of Mary could have been more extreme ? seconds after her first puff she finds herself almost raped before, a mere minute later, shot dead! It is this sort of scare mongering that robs the film of any cautionary educational value it might have had.Overall, this is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination, but if you only watch it to get ironic laughs while you smoke some puff then you are not giving it a chance or meeting it on its own ground ? that of the mid-thirties. The production is average at best ? poor lighting, a poor script, simplistic characters and a real biased spin to the story, but it does have some good in it. It does acknowledge the appeal of the drugs but it is very heavy in making even the mildest drug use look like the worst thing you could possibly do. Despite these major weaknesses, the aim was honourable (even if it failed badly to actually education) and viewers should at least try to view it objectively and not just roar 'it's so bad it's good' within 2 minutes of starting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not To Take This Movie Seriously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can see it whatever way you want, but this movie is bad. There are some funny parts, like the piano player giggling in the closet, and there is melodrama aplenty that some may find interesting, but I wanted my seven dollars back. It's propaganda, no better than shorts from the forties that depicted the Japanese as buck toothed, slant eyed monsters. It's ridiculous and offensive. I heard so much about the absurdity in this movie that made it hysterical. It was not enough to warrant the purchase or even a rental. If you can see it in a large group at a free screening, that would be for the best. Do not expect more than a few laughs from a well meaning, although highly misguided project. It's worth is in more of a historical capacity now.P.S. Comparing this movie to Requiem For A Dream is like comparing Emmanuelle to Last Tango In Paris or Deuces Wild to The Godfather.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not nearly as good as "Maryjane" (1968) which is a true drive-in, B-movie, exploitation classic (that should be available on DVD!), this film is nevertheless quite good from my B-movie-loving, low-budget, nostalgic, camp perspective. Turning the war on drugs on its head, this film promotes the drugs on war. It makes drugs look absolutely alluring! We who don't touch drugs can get our kicks vicariously, watching this truly lurid ooze.It makes EVERYTHING seem endearingly sleazy: drugs, booze, music, cars, buildings, sex, life itself. The perfect place to watch it would be a small, smoke-filled theater with a whiff of rancid popcorn. Like "Maryjane" this cautionary tool has some bits of absolutely ravishing music, and the words themselves are a kind of music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was in the seventh grade, it was my sixth hour science class's favorite pastime to pick on me. They would call me many words I can't repeat here, and all of it was based on the fact that they didn't think I had enough of what they called "fun" in my life. I didn't drink alcohol, I didn't smoke cigarettes. I didn't indulge in bathtub crystal meth. To them, I was a square. Because of this, all the stoners in Mr. Hendry's sixth were quite intrigued when at the beginning of a particular August, I began promoting a tape I had purchased recently. It was called "Reefer Madness" (Tell Your Children). They salivated when I described some of the sequences. Pot smoking. Lots of it. People having near convulsions from all the pot they smoke. And best of all. . .girls. I didn't need to go into great detail, because the prank I would unveil on these automatons would be nothing short of perfect. As the four weeks rolled by, I kept heavily plugging how wicked the film was and how the entire flick was all centered around pot smoking."Did you say there were convulsions," one of the burnouts asked."Oh yes. Lots of those. Just wait, you'll see," I said as I patted him on the back reassuringly.As the day neared, the air was electric. The class was anticipating some sort of extreme Cheech and Chong movie, like 90 minutes of a Sublime video. What they *got*, for anyone who has seen the film, is an overrated advisory movie from the 30's. Sure, there are some schlockily funny scenes, but the revenge was extracted by me on giving these kids the biggest blue balls they'd ever get in their lives. As I sat back in my chair with a satisfied grin deeply embedded on my face, the children stared blankly for all sixty seven minutes. My family moved to another town the next day.

		<shortDescription>It is not a PROPAGANDA FILM.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the reviews that here comment on Reefer Madness, including the highlighted review, seem to be written by people under the mistaken impression that this movie was made as a "propaganda film," produced by a church or the government. Neither is true. This is a specimen of the "exploitation film" variety--a movie framed in such a way that it ostensibly denounces marijuana as a serious evil, but actually exploits this faux-moralizing frame for its dramatic potential.While watching this supposed moral propaganda movie, one must wonder why he is subjected to an extended scene of a woman putting on stockings and a dress? Why we are shown how to harvest marijuana and roll a joint? Why, in god's name, is marijuana directly linked with musical skill? The arc of the story itself disproves the contention that this could be any sort of "propaganda" film. The moral is essentially unrelated to marijuana use.William Harper is actually innocent--the court almost prosecuted him for a murder he did not commit. Ralph, one of the witnesses, is being kept from testifying by the true murderer, Jack. Ralph resolves to tell the truth (after smoking, and realizing the evil of remaining silent any longer). When Jack attempts to murder Ralph to keep the latter from testifying, Ralph kills Jack and is arrested. This incident is instrumental in proving the innocence of William. Because Ralph is forced to murder, and is then apprehended by the police, he goes (at least temporarily) insane.William and Jack are flawed characters. Both of them are compelled to licentious ends, partially by marijuana--but NOT to violent ones. Each is ultimately innocent. Jack, the drug dealer--who is never once even seen smoking marijuana in the movie--is the real villain. While William gets off the hook (though he loses his love), Ralph is not recognized as the true hero of the film. It is he who is responsible for killing the villain, and to him William owes his freedom. He is instead condemned by a biased judge to a mental institution.If one can get passed the false image of this movie, and actually WATCH it, he will be rewarded with a strikingly rewarding film. Part of its humor does derive from the strange light in which marijuana is portrayed. Rather than flatly "uneducated" or "unrealistic," it is rather sensational and--yes--intentionally and creatively funny.The titles of the smaller articles on the newspapers shown throughout the film should be enough to convince anyone that the makers of this film were not entirely serious. "Dick Tracy, G-Man, In Sensational Raid -- 'Stark' Trigger Killed"--"Earth Forces Laid to Cosmic Impulse"--"New Living Buddha Reported Discovered." Yet the plot is crafted with considerate care. It is true, certain characters are exaggerated--but -consciously so-. Every now and then the voice of reason steps in to remind the audience that maybe they shouldn't take everything that is passing on the screen at face value. A typical example is the jury deliberation scene: one juror, unconvinced of the guilt of William, is bullied against his good conscience into voting "guilty" by the other jurors! Yes, it is a story involving marijuana. However, it is far from a propaganda piece--marijuana is not even condemned by the resolution of the film. The only person who harms anyone because of marijuana is Mary's brother, who, after being duped by Jack (the villain) into smoking--for the first time, thinking it is a cigarette--a joint, accidentally side-swipes a pedestrian. Unrealistic? Not really.The acting is uneven, but has its moments; the characters are not unlikeable, the story not unbelievable. (Hey, it could happen to you!) It was made to be an enjoyable film, and I'm glad to say it still is today. The recent colorized version released on DVD is a great job. The humor added through colorization techniques is so subtle and bizarre, it's even more likely to go unnoticed by the casual viewer, than the humor of the original is. It is a true disgrace that more respect is afforded the terrible "movie-musical" based on this masterpiece. I think it is a symptom of how unsophisticated a generic audience is, that unapologetically campy, obviously over-the-top, uninspired garbage is set above a movie of this calibre. If Reefer Madness were made today it would still be a better movie than that "movie musical"--but it was made 70 years ago!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Burning Question?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>******SPOILERS****** Originally titled "Tell Your Children: The Burning Question" the movie "Reefer Madness" was released as an educational film for Americas youth back in 1938 ironically a year after Marihuana, as it's spelled and pronounced in the movie, was made illegal in the United States. It didn't take that long for us to find out just how dangerous it was after it being legal since the days of the Revolutionary War. George Washington himself, the father of our country, is said to have grown it.The movie over the years turned out to be one of the biggest reason for Americas youth getting hooked on drugs via Marijuana then were hooked on drugs by all the Columbian Drug Cartels put together. The fact that the movie was so inaccurate as well as ridicules about "pot" it actually made it seem "cool" for the rebellious youth of the 1960's and 1970's that it became a "Cult Classic". Where people watching it in the movies back then would be encouraged to be stoned out of their heads instead of being repulsed and revolted from smoking it like the movie intended them to be. In fact the movie "Reefer Madness" did it's part in creating the "Drug Generation" thats still with us today. If the movie was more accurate about Marijuana and how it's use can lead to more dangerous drugs it would have been more effective in warning Americas youths as well as adults about the risks of smoking it. But the movie "Reefer Madness" message was just the opposite by telling those who watched it that Marijuana was more dangerous then Opium, Morphine and Heroin combined.The movie starts out with a forward on the dangers of "Marihuana" a violent narcotic and unspeakable scourge. Were then introduced to Dr. Carroll, Joe Forte, who's speaking to us on how the forces of law and order are risking life and limb to put an end to this scourge. Were also told that we the American people must do our part in eradicating that scourge by educating our children about the terrible dangers of "Marihuana".Dr. Carroll tells the theater audience as well as the PTA group that he's addressing in the film about an event involving "Marihuana" that happened not too long ago in the town which they all live in. But this time, from Dr. Carroll, their going to get the real story of what happened. Dr. Carroll tells us about a local group of young people who got caught up with smoking reefers which led to death insanity and suicide.In some of the most outrageous and funniest scenes ever put on film were shown drug parties with a stoned out piano player looking like an escapee from the movie "One Flew Over of the Cuckoo's Nest" and simulated sex among people with their clothes on that went as far as the censors back in those days would allow them to go. One of the young people in the story Bill, Kenneth Craig, accidentally kills his girlfriend Mary, Dorothy Short, when he gets into a fight with one of his friends Ralph, Dave O'Brien, who he catches fondling her as all three of them are stoned on pot. Another young man Jimmy, Warren McCllum, Mary's brother runs down someone in the street with his car while he's smoking a joint. We also see Ralph go insane and attack and kill Jack, Carleton Young, the local drug pusher who tries to kill Ralph because he's afraid that he'll crack and spill the beans on him and his drug suppliers to the police. Finally we get to witness the last tragedy in the movie with Mea, Thelma White, the woman who with Jack threw the drug parties for the youths in her apartment. Mea after confessing everything to the police which gets Bill off from being charged with murdering his girlfriend Mary, who Jack accidentally killed, she jumps to her death out of the window of the courthouse as she's being led away to jail.Bill who was found innocent of killing his girlfriend is made to stay over in the court to see just how dangerous "Marihuana" is and how lucky he was to get off the stuff. Bill is cured of his addiction to pot just by seeing his hopelessly drug addicted friend Ralph,in handcuffs with his eyes bulging out of his skull. Ralph is then sentenced to life in a mental hospital for the criminally insane due to his addiction to "Marihuana". The movie ends with Dr. Carroll warning us that only through the knowledge about the scourge of "Marihuana" can we safely protect our children from the ravages that we just saw in this movie. Then in the final and most emotionally packed scene of the film Dr. Carroll tells us that the very next victim of "Marihuana" may very well be your son or your daughter or yours or yours and then he points his finger straight at the audience and says threateningly OR YOURS! The movie "Reefer Madness" by trying to be serious about the uses of Marijuana back in 1938 turned out to be one of the most funniest and unintentional comedies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil's Weed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that we've come a long way in our thinking on marijuana. Now many advocate its use for medicinal purposes to alleviate pain. It will probably be legalized within the next 20 years in all states.I grew up in the Sixties when the effects of marijuana were being questioned and the view that Reefer Madness espouses was being ridiculed. From my own observation those who used it in the Sixties certainly had a different experience than what you see here. Those that I saw use it became laid back and mellow. What they lost with too much use was a drive to get up and accomplish something. Reverend Jim Ignatowski on Taxi was a perfect example of that. I also remember a public service commercial from the Seventies and Eighties showing these two thirty somethings puffing on the weed and yelling down to one of the smoker's mother that he'll do it tomorrow. That's far more the effect of overindulging in the devil's weed as Reefer Madness shows. Then overindulging in any pleasure is never good.Joseph Forte small town high school principal after a brief prologue tells the tale of a pair of high school kids, Dorothy Short and Kenneth Craig who fall into the evil clutches of dope peddlers Carleton Young and Thelma White. It results in death for one and near death for the other. There's also a friend of Young and White played by Dave O'Brien who had a substantial career in B westerns playing second string leads and sidekicks. He's presented as the model for the crazed dope fiend and he also has an unpleasant fate. O'Brien's performance also presents an exact opposite picture of the marijuana users I knew back in the day.Carleton Young had a most substantial career becoming a member of the John Ford stock company and he got into some classic films for Ford and others. Everyone else in this cast toiled in obscurity.What can you say about a film that is so horribly wrong and dated, with performances and a story that are laughable and looks like it was shot with an old Bell&amp;Howell camera? Give it the bad rating it so richly deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's some comedic highlights of the movie:1. That apparently, a mysterious narcotic called "mariHuana" is responsible for every scary social problem that exists. Rape? Murder? Miscarriages of justice? Those aren't caused by people, those are caused by none other than the wacky weed! Who'da thunkit??2. The piano player in the ice cream shop does an incredible Kramer impression.3. MariHuana, when smoked, gives off several different colors of smoke depending on who is smoking it. I suspect that the technology of mood rings was developed from this peculiar phenomenon.4. The word "swell" is used more than any other word in the English language.5. Dope smokers don't keep a clean house. "It looks like the Marines landed."These among several other absurdities await the brave viewer that wants to find a creative way to waste an hour and a half of their time. As if the movie doesn't present a much more enjoyable way to do it!</fullReview>

Reefer Madness is, I think, the first worst movie even before Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. Reefer Madness tells the account of a bunch of teens that were high as a kite. And when I said high as a kite, I meant that they were on marijuana. Marijuana, according to film, was considered to be "The real public enemy #1!" What, was Al Capone absent to take the Public Enemy #1 title? The acting was so bad that I swear that one the actors is related to the director of Bebe's Kids. Okay, I'm not a fan of marijuana, but I think this movie must've explain the effects of this so-called "public enemy #1" in an exaggerating way. This movie was even considered to be propaganda by the Nostalgia Critic. Bottom line, Reefer Madness is just another corny and bad movie like A Troll in Central Park and the Super Mario Bros movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1936,an exploitation film,originally titled 'Tell Your Children' was released to concerned parental groups about the dreaded menace,Marijuana (which,for whatever reasons was spelled Marihuana---go figure!). According to this filmed expose,Marijuana was condemned as "the Devil's weed",and anybody partaking of it would go insane &amp; become a sex crazed murderer. Now,all seriousness aside,'Tell Your Children' (which also got re-released with various other titles,before it became better known as 'Reefer Madness',when it was re-re-re released in the early 1970's as a midnight cult film playing to stoned out audiences,usually with a cartoon,or a 'Three Stooges' short,as Reefer Madness is only about 65 minutes) is a silly,campy,giddy,overblown melodrama with some of the most misleading information on Marijuana. One can tell that this film was shot with the cheapest budget that one can imagine (the film is cast with total non professionals...although, one of the cast members,Dave O'Brien did make a name for himself some years later as one of the central figures in a series of two reeler's for Pete Smith,for M-G-M throughout the 1940's/1950's,and was a regular on Red Skelton's television variety show in the 1960's). France's own Louis J.Gasnier directs (?)from a screenplay written (hamhanded)by Lawrence Meade &amp; Arthur Hoerl. This is not a film to take seriously,by any means (just drop it in your DVD player,sit back &amp; giggle a lot,like Dave O'Brien's character,when he's stoned to the nines). Not rated by the MPAA,but why bother rating something as goofy as this?</fullReview>

Original title, "Tell Your Children". It is bombastic and over-the-top judging by today's 2009 subtle standards. Its was over 70 years ago and in another time. This film shows the journalistic and newsreel film preachy style of the day. This film earned unexpected success as a classic cult film, this anti-pot film attempts to warn the public to stay away from recreational drugs by suggesting it leads to insanity. This film was part of the successful effort to get federal law against growing, transporting or using marijuana. It tells the story of Bill and Mary, two high schoolers who get involved with dope dealers and become addicted. Their friends try everything to feed their growing habit, ignoring the adverse consequences it has on them and their friends. Several deaths occur due to drug use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real story behind "Reefer Madness"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1932, Harry Anslinger was named head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. The position was not much more than a figurehead because all the bureau was involved in was the amount of morphine etc that were in medicine like cough syrup.Well Anslinger wanted more power and the best way to get power was to put more "narcotics" under his control. So he set his sights on marijuana. He met and became friends with Charles Randolph Hearst (of Citizan Kane Fame) and they talked about their shared dislike of cannabis. Now during this time, there was a real movement to make paper out of hemp. Hearst didn't like this notion because he owned so many timber yards and such, so he and Anslinger agreed to work together to get hemp criminalized.First Hearst started publishing false and sensational stories about the effects of marijuana.Then Anslinger hooked up with a film producer and the end result was Reefer Madness....crazy as it sounds, the scheme worked. The year after Reefer Madness was released, Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Stamp Act which made possession and/or use of marijuana a criminal offense.</fullReview>

Even in 2006 people still seem to judge too harshly their fellow man. I again enjoyed peeping into the past through the eyes of a movie camera. Even though the teenagers were just a bit older than most &amp; most of their actions were really campy. To see how this subject was portrayed was informative in that I believe people reacted strongly to anything they felt that was different than the norm.

I mean, you had to go to someplace like China or Africa or The West Indies to know what the truth was.And it didn't stop there, did it? I mean, in the '50s they came out with HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL and in the '60s MARY JANE. Even THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE shows a couple of the gang members (Vic Morrow and Dan Terranova) smoking a J and drinking (perhaps) Brass Monkey while they plan a robbery. Then in the '70s the same brains came up with THE DEATH OF RICHIE (which WAS a true story, but I think this was more along the lines of what happened between Marvin Gaye and his father; they got into an argument and it became physical). Wouldn't this also be propaganda that cheeba leads to a life of crime? I should think so.Anyway, even my parents had to admit that it was a good laugh. Their own kids smoked without becoming criminal or weird, so they should know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Guess It's Just Fun to Laugh At The Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And nothing worse than seeing rules older than your parents.In reading over the reviews of Reefer Madness (which I have a copy of and am watching again as I type this), many chose to ridicule it based on acting, music, editing and even the way marijuana was spelled with an H instead of a J. Surely people didn't start watching this thing expecting Citizen Kane or Bringing Up Baby! I don't think the makers of Reefer Madness were trying to win an Oscar.Reefer Madness is dated and poorly constructed, obviously propaganda. If I were a teen, I would hardly be swayed from drug use after watching this thing, but I fail to see what is so hilariously funny about this thing or worth seeing in a group either (I guess there is safety in numbers) or being stoned in some capacity while you view it. Afraid it might actually deliver you a message if you were sober? You might as well be stoned when you watch Wuthering Heights, Traffic or Gladiator, for all that matters.Misinformation would have to be if you think Reefer Madness is saying marijuana use will make you commit rape, murder or hit and run. I don't think the message is marijuana use will MAKE you run over someone in a car, but would slow down your ability to respond in time.To tell the truth, the scene looked odd to me because the pedestrian didn't look or seem to even be aware of the large automobile barreling down the road in time. Why were his senses so slow? Perhaps he was using marijuana as well? Fifty years from now, kids feeling more enlightened to what marijuana can and cannot do may watch Cheech and Chong and wonder why they act the way they do too. It can't be from the drugs! Drugs don't make you act the way Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong behave, they'll think. After School Specials, Diseases of the Week, Public Service Announcements, Just Say No, from Fat Albert to Roseanne have dealt with drug use. Reefer Madness simply stands as the first one to deliver the message. Talk about not killing the messenger.Interesting that in the courtroom, the witness is saying marijuana slowed the young man's senses in tennis playing. Compare this to the episode of Absolutely Fabulous when Patsy's drug snorting increased her ability to play ping pong. Absolutely Fabulous. Now there was an excellent exploration of substance abuse. Definitely compare Reefer Madness to AbFab.But there is hardly anything so critical of this thing. It is a piece of film history. If it offers misinformation about marijuana (more harmful than heroin? I consider any form of addiction harmful. This sounds like saying a bullet to the temple is more reliable than slit wrists, or the other way around. If the drug is addictive, it's harmful) then I found Easy Rider just as misleading when Peter Fonda preached drug use to Jack Nicholson but when Nicholson questioned what bad things he had heard about the drug, Fonda took on this sullen expression of "I guess you're not my friend then" that I found as awful as this man in Reefer Madness saying how marijuana is bad. Preaching is preaching, no matter what the message.It's just no fun seeing the problems of substance abuse and addiction wasn't learned in our generation. We prefer to think the parents of baby boomers were naive in their thinking and card playing was the worst thing they did.So the only thing to do then is laugh at this thing and call it dumb. Now who's being naive?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failure as anti-drug propaganda, unintended camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, intended as anti-marijuana propaganda, obviously failed at its purpose. Instead it became a campy horror film of unintended silliness -- grist for unintended parody. It went into oblivion until marijuana re-entered the scene, and it re-emerged only to demonstrate the fraudulence of the old anti-drug crusade. Reefer Madness probably led more people to use marijuana than any other promotion; indeed one almost has to be on drugs to appreciate this flick. It is a despicable piece of movie making for its racism (note how it treats Mexican-Americans) and its excessive explicitness of what marijuana can do. Marijuana, to be sure, is a health hazard for the same reasons that tobacco is dangerous, but hardly as dangerous as LSD, heroin, cocaine, PCP, ecstasy, or methamphetamines to anyone -- or alcohol to children.During the 1970s college audiences watched this flick and had their own snide comments about it. Did the figures of MST3K get their ideas of how to create their format of irreverent commentary about a bad movie? The college audience -- even the conservatives among them (by 1970's standards) with whom I watched it found it hilarious for all the reasons that its makers would have found inconceivable. Unintended camp; abject failure as propaganda. If this had been the norm for World War II propaganda by the Allies, then we would all be speaking either German or Japanese.One can accept it as a camp horror story, even ahead of its time. Such was not its purpose. Entertainment value was not a purpose, which is also true of films whose intention is to promote industrial or highway safety. If the Highway Patrol creates a gory film on auto accidents that deters bad driving, then the film, whatever its other shortcomings, is excused; one simply doesn't show the film for paying customers in a theater. This movie fails at its intended purpose and thus deserves contempt. One star of ten from me because of its complete failure at its purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was ridiculous. It may have been from the 1930's, it may have been a propaganda film, and it may have been full of ridiculous, false scenarios. But even after you take that into consideration, this was horrible. Basically, the film is about a bunch of teenagers who smoke marijuana and then hell breaks loose and they all end up killing each other and themselves. People say that this is supposed to be funny (as are most '30s propaganda films) but this was just plain dumb. This is an extended, low-budget commercial that is NOT funny in the slightest bit. Even if you love movies about people smoking pot, stay away from this and you will thank me. Feel free to email me with any questions or comments.</fullReview>

Also, just a little personal paranoia of mine: did anyone else notice such a split gender imdb vote ever? This one sure appears to cut mustard(just so) with most women out there.

		<shortDescription>Reefer Madness in COLOR is a great campy weed movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the one that started it all. The First drug movie ever and it's great. Many crummy DVD versions of Reefer Madness are out there (bad dirty prints, poor contrast). But thankfully 20th Century Fox released (on 4/20 - get it?) a beautifully restored version of the movie. And then they went one further and added a COLOR version on the same DVD. But wait, there's more, they also added a great commentary by Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theater which really caps off this definitive release.The movie itself is perfect for a Mike Nelson riff. It's definitely one of those "It's so bad it's good" movies. Originally made as a 1930's propaganda film, it was meant to scare America 's youth away from drugs, showing them that one puff of the 'demon weed' turns teens into raving reefer addicts. In this hilarious cautionary tale, those who do inhale find themselves plunged into a web of murder, sex, lunacy, and jazz music. Now, years later, this ham-fisted effort to warn you off weed has become the height of camp entertainment. A movie so beautifully bad, it's great.If you want to take a TRIP back to the 1930's and see what your Grandfather's potheads were all about, this is the movie for you. Fire it up any time! And get the Fox version to enjoy it in psychadellic color - they even blow colored dope smoke!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well last night my friend and I smoked some of the demon weed and watched Reefer Madness. It was so obvious that it was made by people who had not only never been stoned, but had never even seen someone who was stoned. For a start the dancing in the apartment; Impossible! I couldn't move my legs. My friend and I figured out that the only way someone smoking dope could rob somewhere would be to go into a shop to buy munchies, pick up a banana and absent mindedly hold it like it was a gun, then get distracted by the sweets at the counter. When the cashier asked if they wanted anything else they stared at the sweets and said "Give me everything".While I know from my own research that Cannabis has been linked, however tenuously, to certain mental problems so has sugar, coffee alcohol and television. But what I do know for certain is that while on dope you are incapable of hurting anybody else, even if they are hogging all the munchies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tell Your Children (1936) BOMB (out of 4)In this ground-breaking document of a major social issue, TELL YOUR CHILDREN tries to explain the dangers of marijuana and why parents need to confront their children about this insane drug. We meet a nice boy and girl who have everything going for them. That is until the boy gets involved with underground pot parties that turn him into a raving maniac.Better known as REEFER MADNESS, this 1936 film might be one of the worst ever made but it's also one of the most entertaining thanks in large part to its way too serious look at marijuana. If you're watching this film it's almost hard to believe that there was a time when people took this film serious and thought it spoke the truth about the little green plant. I guess it's scary that people still think that one puff can turn you into a sex-craved maniac.REEFER MADNESS, on a technical level, is quite awful as the performances, the direction, the editing and just about everything else is pretty bad. Where the entertainment level comes from is just how laughable its views on smoking marijuana is including some hilarious scenes where the actors take a couple hits and turn into Mr. Hyde in regards to their sinister behavior. The party scenes in the film are certainly the highlight because of how crazy and funny they are.I'm sure there have been many "parties" thrown while watching this movie and it's rather funny to see a film like this remain so popular while many "classics" from 1936 are now forgotten. Say what you will but REEFER MADNESS is certainly a film that will never die off.</fullReview>

Now let us travel back to the other two above mentioned elements that make this a terrible movie. 1.Plot- I can say a lot about the plot of this movie, but to save your time, it's worse than all the high school/teen movies. 2.Acting- Oh my god the acting in this movie! my personal favorite example is when Ralph is brought into the trial raving mad. Look at his eyes! I seriously believe this should be present on the bottom 100, I'm putting in my vote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is historical humor. I rated it a 5 because it would appeal only to a certain type of person who likes cheesy, goofy cult classics. I can totally appreciate it for it's educational attempt at the time. I'm glad it's kinda short and it ends when the exaggeration of this 'powerful mind altering drug' starts to annoy. Overall, I would rate it a 100% classic, but 100% cheesy. Cheesy in its attempt to scare the audience, but funny that it probably did at the time. The cheesiness makes it the classic it is. Actually, it may scare children under 10 and therefore scare them a while, at least until they learn somehow that the movie is an outdated exaggeration. So, tell your children, with the influence of South Parks 'drugs are bad, if you do drugs your bad', it might hold them off from experimenting.....at least a few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trying to find any logical, common sense in this propaganda film is like trying to find some actual "words" in George W. Bush's speeches. The film focuses on how teens who are clean cut become insane, killing freaks when taking just one puff of marijuana. I actually do recommend this movie- to potheads, and perhaps some that are not. So that they, like I, can laugh they're heads off at the idiotic and unsound attempts to try and thwart off teens from smoking pot. Kids (I mean like 8 and 9 year olds) should not watch this movie not because they might be scared from smoking pot (perhaps for all the silly reasons), but because whenever they see someone smoke it they will (knowing kids) think that person is Freddy Kruger. If people are serious about censoring content in movies, it should be in this one.Still, the film is hilariously stupid, and as long as you don't take it in the very smallest amount of seriousness, it will be some fun. Reisenfeld and Roemheld's music is also amusing to the film. 2010: As an amendment to this, I should also note how the film rises to a whole other level if this is watched with Rifftrax (the MST3K guys), who have recorded a new commentary track with the movie, and color-tinted no less! You'll never look at crazed monkey-on-your-back pot smokers and their ilk ever again. Certainly not the lame nerdy character talking to the camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lousy movie any way you look at it, but somewhat fun on a camp level ONLY.**SPOILERS AHEAD** A nauseatingly clean-cut pair of teenage lovers (Kenneth Craig, Dorothy Short) have their lives destroyed when he becomes addicted to marijuana. She is accidentally shot to death (by one bullet) while he was hallucinating and he is (unjustly) put on trial for her murder.That whole part is ridiculous. For starters the bullet goes into her back--that is NOT going to automatically kill someone. Also, it was impossible for her to get shot--the gun isn't even pointing in her direction when it goes off! Also, according to this film, one puff of marijuana immediately leads to addiction. This starts by uncontrollable giggling, then hallucinations, then sex, then violence and finally insanity. Obviously, the filmmakers had no idea what they were talking about. No talent for making films either. Bad acting (although Lillian Miles was OK), teenagers who look like they're 30, lousy direction, stupid script...a textbook example of how NOT to do a film. Still, in has many unintentionally hilarious moments, especially Miles' piano solo and Ralph (Dave O'Brien) slowly going insane. Good for laughs only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment is a rebuttal to the comment of dtucker86. The "danger" of marijuana has never been shown to rival the dangers of substances and activities that we take for granted. Every year more people die from aspirin than have ever died from a marijuana overdose. According to a 1994 US Justice Dept study, alcohol usage promotes violent behavior while marijuana usage inhibits violent behavior.Certainly intoxication has its costs, and I oppose the reckless use of any intoxicant. However, anybody who thinks that the "dangers" of marijuana justify the enormous cost (in both human suffering and money) of the war on drugs should read the 1988 finding by an administrative court of the US DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION (docket no.86-22, Sept. 6, 1988) from which I quote,"Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the misery, agony, horror and unfairness in this world are simply caused by one hellish breed of weed: Marihuana! You better believe it, because they even made a truly realistic and petrifying (ahem?) documentary about it. To put it in the words of a genuine stoner: this stuff is awesome! "Reefer Madness" causes more laughs, hallucinations and unforeseen situations than any type of drug ever could. This basically abysmal excuse for a film opens with a university professor informing us about a supposedly factual and tragic series of evens that overcame a bunch of virulent American youngsters. They had everything to make it in life, but then the evil monster named Marihuana crossed their paths? The fiendish weed causes adultery, hit-and-run car accidents, gunfights, cover-up conspiracies and even suicide. Mainly because the content of this "documentary" is so grotesque and exaggerated (and because to this date, it remains some sort of mystery who exactly ordered to make it), "Reefer Madness" is an eagerly wanted must-have item among cult collectors. The acting performances as well as the production values are downright amateurish and laughable, which only makes the seriousness of the narrator's tone of voice even funnier, and the script is filled with contradictions. For example, the boy who cased a nearly fatal hit-and-run accident is advised by his drug-supplier to keep a low profile and the whole thing simply isn't mentioned anymore! The government actually ought to instruct directors to make a documentary about the incompetence of their own law enforcers, as there were plenty of witnesses on the scene of the car accident, yet they're still unable to trace the driver and arrest him? Now, that's alarming! "Reefer Madness" is one of the most incomprehensibly amusing and stupid things ever captured on film and it's fabulous viewing pleasure for when you're together with a bunch of friends. You don't have to be high on drugs in order to laugh your heart out, but I suppose it helps.</fullReview>

Moments of the movie are quite funny but overall it's really boring and pointless to watch unless you just think you're special for smoking weed and want to see an old movie about it, and people who smoke weed do seem to think they're special for whatever reason, oh well this movie sucks bottom line 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I see or hear people talking about the worst movies ever made, I am surprised that I so often hear about Ed Wood but not this wretched little exploitation film. While it IS famous for being bad, I wasn't prepared for just how awful the movie was! The acting is among the worst I've seen, the dialog is pure crap and the film appears to have directed by a gibbon.The film begins with a boring narrator talking to his audience about the evils of marijuana. Then, he tells a "TRUE" story about some kids who dabbled in pot--only to have their lives ruined! He explains that pot is WORSE than heroin or cocaine and it leads to insanity or death!! The narrator disappears and we see some people who look way too old to be students and the actual story begins. You can tell these MUST be kids, though, despite their apparent ages because they say "golly" and "swell" in almost every sentence! Plus, considering how badly they read their lines, they CAN'T be adults! The movie concerns young wholesome American Billy and shows his rapid slide from all-around swell guy to a man accused of murder! In addition to poor Billy, you are treated to a man who goes insane due to repeated marijuana use as well as a lady leaping through a window to her death. Golly that's bad! Gee it's a hoot seeing the crazy pot user when his girlfriend is maniacally playing the piano.The film is unintentionally hilarious and VERY exploitative (showing a lot of skin and "racy" scenes for 1936). It's a shame, though, as some who laugh at this film for its way over-statement of the effects of pot may think that drugs are okay--or even fun. In fact, I would think drug abusers would LOVE this film because it might make them laugh at the idea that drugs can kill--after all, they might reason that if the movie is mostly a big lie about pot, maybe other drugs aren't so bad as well. So, very possibly this little film warning about the evils of drugs actually encouraged drug use!</fullReview>

Knowing that the government feels that they can lie to us with impunity, we are less likely to believe anything else they tell us. This is dangerous to those who might try harder drugs as they have been lied to once, and will not heed the warnings given by the same liars. It also means we would tend to ignore things like terrorist threats as the government lies about that also.This film is important as it shows the government cannot ever be trusted.

Today this film is looked upon as a cult classic, its considered very laughable and naive, people make fun of it. I don't think it is a laughing matter. People need to realize how dangerous marijuana is. The filmakers of 1936 had the best intentions when they made this film, yes we didn't know as much as we do today, yes it does seem campy and outdated. People need to realize, however, their intentions were to warn people of the danger of marijuana and it is still just as dangerous today and so many of the things they said in this film are absolutely correct. One of the best books I ever read on drug abuse was by a man named David Toma (he was a police detective whose real life exploits were the basis for the tv series Toma and Baretta). He's well known as an anti-drug lecturer. He pointed out that pot is just as bad as any other drug. There have been cases where people have killed themselves, or other people or gone insane and all they did was smoke pot. Even though this film may seem campy today, its basic message is still just as important.</fullReview>
