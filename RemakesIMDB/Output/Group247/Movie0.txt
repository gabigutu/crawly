		<shortDescription>Embarrassing bastardized version of a French classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, how low can we go" Since this movie was (improperly) advertised as the "English (USA) version of the award-winning French comedy", let me inform readers about the original.The original award-winning comedy classic quickly became an international success both artistically as financially. Receivinh numerous honors including six Cesar nominations winning three: best script, best actor, and best supporting actor. The "Cesar du cinema Francais" is similar to our (USA) Oscar Academy Awards and annually rewards the best performance in the various cinema-related specialties from acting to production. It has been used as a teaching model for writing intelligent humorous scripts, inventive editing, and acting in some cinema schools. Thhe French adapted their script from his play of the same title which premiered in 1997 and has been playing ever since in Europe. It is a masterpiece worth discovering. The script was intelligently written, the quick paced dialog flowed harmoniously as the protagonist's situation deteriorated. The interpretation was sensitive, expressive and flawless.Back to LOL: As an American, I found the Hollywood version insulting and demeaning. Trying to bank on the success of the original as is often the case with remakes, you take whatever worked in the first presentation, recycle it, repeat it over, amplify it, mass produce it, etc? In LOL, you steal an original premise, bastardize a bullet-proof script, exaggerate the humorous moments to absurdity, add profanity and obscenity to the dialogue, mix in some scenes, sanitize to ensure (American) political correctness, include most ethnic groups to maximize distribution (i.e. profit margin), the only thing missing may have been to add some farts and burps? You get the picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's one way to describe this movie, it would be utterly atrocious, execrable trash. In no way are there any redeeming qualities in this "film" as it is filled with a moronic plot, hideous dialog(if you can call it that)banal acting and overall crap. The whole thing is a ruse; it looks like a low-budget made-for-TV film that ironically enough SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MADE-FOR-TV FILM IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! I'm sorry, but after Hanna Montana and the atrocious film that followed it, Miley Cyrus's career as an actress is pretty much in the toilet. Only a wickedly hardcore Miley Cyrus fan would watch this because any self-respecting movie-lover would stay clear away from this hell-hole of a movie.1 out of 5 stars. That's how bad this piece of sh*t is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awful remake of an already awful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay first things first, you should know that this movie is a remake of a crappy French movie of the same name. If that doesn't deter you from watching, then maybe knowing that Miley Cyrus is starring as the lead role does.I never had high hopes for this movie especially since Lionsgate completely shunned the marketing team and had no effort in making sure that this movie gets some much needed publicity. But aside from that, this movie isn't really targeted for people like me. It seems to focus on its teen demographic, hell the title says it all...LOL.Now I'm not hating on Miley Cyrus or anything but God that girl really brought down the movie. I thought that she could maybe prove that she can act and switch away from that Hannah Montana crap, but no, she cannot. And having Demi Moore didn't help either. It's like the cast had every intention to make a god-awful movie that only teenage girls would barely like.Overall, the movie was your average run of the mill, teenage love affair crap. If you're a guy then stay the hell away from this movie, but if you're a girl then...no, you should also stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of Film Reels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A monotonous, dreadful film that follows the gimmicks of social networking and text messaging. I wouldn't classify this as a movie; it falls along the lines of high school trauma and the depressing pokes of a Facebook page. The acting was sub-par and the love story was the equivalent of rusty nails while it focuses on the redundant internet slang we constantly see today. The whole feeling of the film was basically like looking at a Facebook page. Very dull and asinine with the sense of delusional romance forever reminding us how little hope remains for todays youth. If this is what you call quality entertainment then I fear for the sanctity of our Media. Major waste of filming resources and should be shot into the sun for the sake of humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOL - Load of "Load" (If you get my drift)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to summarize here:This "film" bears about as much connection with modern society as KFC represents the life of Chickens. Not only is it the most cheese filled pap ever, it's a walking cliché and the people in it, even say the word "LOL" rather than actually laughing, in one scene; one person even rolls around the floor laughing when she is told a joke by her friend, and it wasn't even funny. The entire dialogue in this film looks as if it has actually been written on a Nokia 3310 by a 10 year old boy, who has ADHD, no offence to people who actually HAVE ADHD, but seriously, it's like they've given a child three things:1. MDMA.2. 90 Blank Sheets of Paper and a typewriter.3. 2 Days to complete it.The acting is below par and even in one scene, it is blatantly obvious that the actress has forgotten her lines, so she seems to make her line up on the spot. How on earth did Demi Moore get roped into this? Demi Moore has made some god awful movies in her time, but this will be a black hole on her CV for many years to come and I imagine she is only kicking herself to the loony bin for partaking in this absolute rubbish.Then I have to mention the obvious fake posts on here which are condoning and praising this teeny bopper movie, which is obviously made to capitalise on fans of the girl out of this, kids who are grounded and have to use their phones as a social outlet, LOL, and teen kids who have nothing better to do with their money than go and see how the media thinks they should live their lives.Anyone paying to watch this god awful trash should take themselves and get counselling, go and see a doctor, because whilst there are thousands and thousands of good script writers trying to earn a living, thousands of actors trying to break through; and thousands of budding directors just aching for a chance to even get 1% of this budget for their work; production companies are still lying and pulling the wool over our eyes with pap like this.If you are fan of the girl in this film, think about it, and think about it hard!!!If you actually like this girl, then you will NOT go and put money into the pockets of the greed ridden pigs who are actually trying to exploit YOU as well as your idol. So I'm not going to give you grief for liking this girl; like most will, but seriously think about it before you part with your money. If this film does even remotely well, the fat corporate pigs will only release more pap with her in, to try and prize YOUR hard earned money from your hands, and in turn, the big wheel of fortune will grind away on YOU and ONLY YOU!It says something when a production company pull out of post production marketing like they did on this kids, they want to BURY it without trace, because they know how terrible this film truly is! Fair enough, watch it on cable (it will be on there soon enough), download it from some kind of torrent site, but whatever you do, do NOT go and spend a penny of your money on this, you will regret it for years to come.Long live the free thinkers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I regret going to see this movie. Says it all. I was dragged along to it by an overly excited friend who wanted to see it. I couldn't of despised this movie more if I tried. The only difficulty about this now is trying to reach the minimum requirements for the length of this review.Right, so I expect people seem like they know what to expect with this movie. Otherwise, why go see it. Miley plays nothing more than how she does on her TV series. A ditsy girl with poor use of English. Which isn't surprising.If I had to recommend this to someone, it would be those under 11 years of age.One good thing about the experience of seeing this.. "movie" was that I felt relief when it was over.But hey, if you want to waste some cash with minimal physical and, let's face it.. mental effort, then see this wasted reel of film. 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've got a Juno poster in my room. There! I'm smart now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie, LOL, the character, Lola, has a poster for the smash-hit, Juno, hanging in her bedroom. I know, I know. Analyzing a detail as small as this might sound nitpicky but just hear me out.Juno was a movie about a teenager who addressed the people she loved and the people she had problems with, in person. Juno revealed an ultrasound picture of her baby to its future adoptive parents, in person. She laid out an entire living room set on Paulie Bleeker's front lawn, to tell him she was pregnant, in person. The reason its main character maintained quick-witted comebacks and came up with ironic allegories, at the drop of a hat, was because of her characteristic of going out and exploring new things. That movie was so refreshing because it took place in a world in which teenagers didn't constantly have the glow of a cell phone screen, reflecting off of their faces. In fact, there was only one part in the film involving a phone conversation between two people...and both sides had their phones plugged into a jack!So why does LOL's mentioning of such a great movie bother me? Because its own message contradicts Diablo Cody's vision and her faith in teenagers. Cody believed in a world in which adolescents might actually look up from their gadgets, turn to each other and like, talk. Hell, there actually is a scene from Wall-E, in which two morbidly obese men favor looking at monitors with video feed each other, when they're in floating chairs, side by side. Juno spits in the face of such technological dependence.LOL, on the other hand, condones the non-stop usage of iPods, Twitter and other sites of the moment. Its lead characters are so reliant of online social networks, where every sentence is simplified and shortened, that once they finally log off, they use phrases like "it's good to love someone so much it hurts." A line like that wouldn't even make it into Juno's deleted scenes section on the DVD. LOL celebrates the idea of kids, hunching their heads over a five by three inch screen all day long, as the rest of the world passes them by. Don't get me wrong - I'm well aware that there actually are teenagers in the world who are this overly consumed. With it being near impossible to find a person between the ages of 18 and 29 NOT on a phone within a three hour period of time, writer and director, Lisa Azuelos, isn't exactly making up fiction here. But to try to portray these hypnotized kids as deep thinking and complex is wrong. How could they have the drive to reflect on who they are when they don't even put effort into typing out full words into text messages? Like I said, it's fine for characters like these to exist because there are real world people like this. But don't try dragging another film down to your level when it boasts unexplained emotions, open for interpretation while your own best moment of self-reflection consists of the line "Every year, it's weird going back to school but here we are, just going with the flow". Oo-hoo-hoo, look out, Hemingway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel bad for the critics who have to endure a single second of having to watch this "movie". Miley Cyrus is back once again at trying to act and we all know what that means. That's right C list actors and bad plot lines. This movie looks awful from the get go,i usually give these the benefit of the doubt but this is just bad. The director's attempt at high school drama is pitiful and the main character seems like one of the popular girls you were forced to partner with in chemistry class. You all know the one i'm talking about, the one with the rich parents who bought her anything no matter what and treated everyone like a peasant. This movie is basically about the popular girl and all her little social problems. There's no escaping the fact that Ms. Cyrus cannot act and putting her in this role with others who have no idea what they're doing just adds fuel to the fire. My advice: Go watch a real movie with actors who can do their jobs well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: LOL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Hollywood film to premiere in India this year, which is quite apt since I suppose audiences in India can appreciate remakes upon remakes hitting their screens every now and then, since different movie regions in India have cross-made their films especially if they are financially successful. This version of LOL is a second generation remake, with the original film made with French actress Sophie Marceau playing the role of Miley Cyrus' titular role of Lola, before switching to play Demi Moore's role of mom in writer-director Lisa Azuelos' 2006 version, who then decided to direct the same film all over again, this time with Hollywood money. I suppose it's tough getting bored when doing the same project, albeit with a different cast bringing different sensibilities to the table, and of course, being set in different countries allowed for an exploration of the modern / current day teenage trials and tribulations, and see how they would have differed from the very first film. For starters, this is an out and out teenage chick flick, set in high school where topics are rather constricted, ranging from bad grades to boys, to hot teachers and cliques, circle of trust and betrayals, and so on. High schools make for very fertile ground as a story setting, but you really can't get away from the formula, even if technology from webcams to IM chat sessions enter to spice things up a littleMiley Cyrus had a scene involving smoking of drugs here cut out, because a real life shenanigan blew way out of control with the teenage idol hell bent and desperate to leave behind her Disney child-friendly persona of Hanna Montana. Be it having provocative personal pictures making their way online, to recreational drug use or otherwise, the filmmakers probably thought it best to leave behind the negative publicity, and cut that out of the film. Which didn't do the flow any favours at times, with other less than stellar editing efforts such as a following scene that contradicted what was said before.In any case Cyrus plays Lola, a teenager who opens the film being dumped by her boyfriend Chad (George Finn), and we'd just about know that she'll fall head over heels with her best male buddy Kyle (Douglas Booth) especially after gushing ad nausem about him and confessing so in her secret diary. But the road to true romance is always a bumpy ride, so you can bet your last dollar it has to deal with misunderstandings which led to temporal breakups and the like, not to mention falling school grades all over the shop make school life quite the bane to a relationship. Kyle too has issues with his dad's frowning upon his musical CCA, but since this is a chick flick, who really cares about the male characters anyhow, except when they fail to pout and look hot.Subplots in the film that pad it up include a focus on Lola's best friend Emily (Ashley Hinshaw), who has the hots for her math teacher (Austin Nichols) with dream boat looks, and is the female equivalent of a Stifler or that obligatory rude, shock jock in any teenage sex comedy, and of course, Mom Anne, which the film splits 50-50 with her own relationship, being unable to move on from the husband (Thomas Jane) she divorced, and being at the crossroads to begin one with a rather persistent cop James (Jay Hernandez). Plus the dynamics between mother-daughter getting the highlights and focus as well, between Anne and Lola where sometimes they drive each other nuts, only to always inherently realize blood runs thicker than water.LOL, after so many iterations, came off as flat and offered little surprises to fans of such films, who lap it up only because of a different cast. It's the usual chick flick dealing with rudimentary issues for its formula, which in real life may not even be issues at all. It's mildly amusing with nary a class act from anyone in their delivery, and perhaps it's that generation gap that's fast driving a wedge between myself and issues brought up in the film which may seem like a big deal for one growing up. Surely it's a coming of age tale, but I'm not getting it, nor am I the right demographic targeted to begin with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just took the time to watch this movie, as it was one of PirateBay's most downloaded.I honestly can not understand how anyone manages to do enough drugs to imagine this would be a good movie when writing the script. Luckily enough for me I was smart enough to not spend any money to watch the movie. I do however feel that I've not only been robbed for my time, but also for all of the knowledge I've ever gathered over the years. I am certain that at one point I could feel my brain melting away.I still do not understand the plot of the movie as there was no red string connecting the movie, and it would jump from one story to another without ever finishing what it started. I am left feeling empty, as I don't know for instance what happened to Kyle and his dad after the Battle of the Bands.If I would have to recommend this movie to anyone, it would be for brain dead tweens who believe that Europe is a country located in the United States, and that Justin Bieber is the greatest thing to happen to this world since the invention of make-up and hair straighteners.Seriously, don't waste your time watching the movie, as you will most likely suffer severe brain damage afterward, and have troubles remembering anything useful that you've ever learned.1/10</fullReview>

That's hard to believe isn't it, but it is.There were a few actors that did OK but they were not the main ones. I wonder if anyone was able to sit through this beside critics.You have to wonder how these movies make it to the screen the way it is. I mean someone along the way must have known that it was bad and told someone else. Even if not, surely early previews by the crew should have brought up questions and concerns.

		<fullReview>Despite knowing the cast before seeing LOL, I decided to keep an open mind. I always feel as though I can examine something in further detail if I put aside all previous knowledge of the subject. This attitude quickly changed.Another perfect demonstration of Miley Cyrus' rise to fame surfing on her father's back. As per usual, zero effort put in to her performance. This becomes increasingly worsened via the slaughter of what was once an excellent script. Humour (if it can even be referred to as such) pushed to its very limits; and scenes that had viewers covering their faces as though ashamed to be seen as they fled the cinema before even 20 minutes in.What amuses me the most however, is that this actually seems to be getting positive feedback from a very small, direct audience. Simple movies for simple minds I suppose.</fullReview>

Lola, the main character, was with a different guy every other minute of the movie, with little to no story behind it. All of the guys looked the same, so it was extremely confusing. There were also many girls who looked the same, and were also very confusing. The movie was altogether quite boring, and I would not recommend it to anyone. I also think it should have gotten a higher rating. It had a lot of mature things in it, that were not thirteen-year-old appropriate.</fullReview>

Also just for your information teenagers - "LOL" is an abbreviation we were using in the 90s when we invented the internet as it is now, go make up your own stuff!</fullReview>

Instead of visiting beautiful places like the Seine River for a boat trip, they just fooled around dancing in the fountains, shopping and of course having sex. Visiting Paris it was "not a big deal" just as Miley Cyrus said, America style of life is way better.Also in the agenda of this movie they talk about how Cannabis is harmful and "it causes schizophrenia and brain damage", stated the police detective in front of all the kids, they are LYING, in fact there have been many studies proving that cannabis promotes neuronal growth. they don't even mention the dangerous drugs (eg cocaine, heroine).Why are they making this kind of movies?

		<shortDescription>There is absolutely no way this ever could be mistaken for "Hannah Mantana"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film appears to be a very, very loud statement by Miley Cyrus that she is no longer the sweet and innocent Hannah Montana but is 'edgy'--and the results come off as rather vulgar just for the sake of vulgarity. The characters in the film use lots of profanity, lie repeatedly, are obsessed with sex, make passes at their high school teachers (now THAT'S a positive story element!), smoke, drink heavily, do drugs and act sullen and selfish. But at least they remember to use condoms! Yep...this certainly ain't "Hannah Montana"! Now I CAN understand Cyrus wanting to broaden her appeal and grow up, but this is NOT the right way to do it--especially since I am sure many of her TV fans ended up going to this film. As a parent of a teen, I just thought this was nasty...very, very nasty. While I know many teens ARE like this, why did everyone (parents included) have to be so darn unlikable?! Yes, the 'adults' seemed no better! This gets to the heart of the film's problem--the unlikability of everyone. Although the production values are good, what good did this film do for Cyrus' flagging career and who was the intended audience? Apart from extremely disaffected 18-20 year-olds (who probably wouldn't be caught dead going to a Miley Cyrus film as that's NOT cool), I have no idea. Parents would be offended and shocked and nice kids would probably not appreciate its strong PG-13 (close to R) sensibilities--or be allowed to see the film. I just wish everyone would just grow up in this film. And, by the way, when the film had an anti-drug message, it's very strong pro-drug message through the earlier part of the film made this all seem very hypocritical.While I hated the film and thought it gross, some of the Indie music was nice (though, as an old man of 48, if I liked it then it clearly is NOT cool and kids will hate it) and the production values (apart from the script) were nice. Clearly, the film cost a bit of money and is not an Ed Wood epic...but it certainly ain't great. Apparently, for a while this film was in IMDb's Bottom 100 list. However, a recent spike now has lifted it to an overall score of 2.8--still hardly a great film if ratings can be trusted...and in this case, they probably can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With me being 13 this movie was, obviously, aimed for an audience around my age. And let's just say this movie was appalling. Hell, that's an understatement. It was absolutely horrific.I was quite excited to see this. I didn't expect it to be Oscar material or anything. Oh God no. I just expected a light, entertaining film. I personally liked the original from which this was based and I hoped this was Miley's big shot to break out from her Hannah Montana, childish demographic. But f*ck no. The main character, Lola, almost made Hannah look inspiring! I'd rather watch a Hannah Montana marathon than lay my eyes on the opening credits of this film ever again.I personally dislike Miley's acting 'career'. (I don't fancy Ashley Greene's either) But I mean, come on! Not even Demi Moore can cover up for her idiocy! Miley's personal music career and her most recent album surprised me and gave me higher hopes.But nope. Her acting still sucks. She can barely speak English.So, folks, just remember this-- A pretty face can not aid a weak persona.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is it that almost every movie that one of those music pop stars features in is an utter, waste of theater seats, waste of the young minds' grey matter.. Not that any is used in understanding the non-existent complexity of the production, but because it should be devoted to something else... I don't know, watching Shutter Island maybe? You might be thinking this review says nothing specific about the movie, and you'd be right. Nothing in it is worth putting into words. I'd rather spare you the dull read.You know whenever a member posts their first review, it's usually on a movie that's absolutely blown them out of the water. Not the case for me here. Not sure if I should be proud of it.Briefly put, if you're a middle-aged or even a young man eager to find out why your daughter or teen girlfriend adores this movie and if you want to go and see what's what, all I've got to say to you is... For the love of God, DON'T.A.Y.M.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LOL. That's exactly what to do after watching this movie. Not because of any tummy-tickling humor or laugh-til-you-drop moments, but of the fact that this is even remotely considered a movie at all! LOL follows Lola (played by Miley Cyrus), a stereotypical teenager going through her stereotypical problems in her stereotypical life. Aside from a few sentimental mother/daughter moments and a well-fitted soundtrack this movie holds nothing special. It lacks meaning with it's stale dialogue recycled from the more vapid teenagers facebook page. If anything can be learned from this movie it's that internet slang should remain on the internet! Miley's performance is, as usual, bland, with nothing more to offer than the reciting of the script and a splash of her usual rebellious demeanour. She falls in love with her best friend Kyle, who just so happens to play in a band called 'No Shampoo', with her ex-boyfriend. Aside from this predictable coincidence you'll be pleased to know that they take the whole 'No Shampoo' thing to the next level by applying this philosophy to Miley's hairstyle throughout the movie. No doubt they saved a considerable amount of their budget! All in all the movie lacks a genuine plot as we observe lingering conflicts which end up simply dealt with and lack the epiphany needed to make them the focus of the film. The movie as a whole seems to avoid the traditional 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', which we normally associate with successful films, so that it's unclear to see what the films motive is. To say this movie was a 'disappointment' would be a huge understatement and a great compliment to it! So for all you movie-lovers out there who're looking for a good movie to watch, this is definitely not your cup of tea! Rating: 4/10 ... and that's me being generous</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teenagers relate to this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never liked Miley Cyrus so I'm not sure what induced me to watch this movie in the first place. I think I'd hoped because Demi Moore was in it that the movie would have some substance. The movie had no substance, and Miley Cyrus came across a bit slutty in it. There was no moral ground for teenagers whatsoever. It almost seemed to encourage drugs, sex and disobeying your parents. Perhaps because I was not rebellious as a teen, I couldn't relate to the characters. The story seemed to have no purpose. The film seemed to want to play on the social media and texting culture of kids but didn't seem to grasp the concept. The messages the characters sent to each other didn't really communicate anything. Suspect the messages were written by someone who doesn't have a facebook or text very much. Would not recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have any expectations for this movie, but I was still highly disappointed. The plot was boring and thin, it could have been so much more. I'm usually even not a fan of movies this type, and I have no idea why I even watched this movie. And I do regret wasting 92 minutes of my life to this film. Things that was supposed to be meaningful, were just left there without any explanation. Characters were too stereotypical and the "important" thing that was supposed to happen between the mum and daughter happened in the last fifteen minutes. Felt like they had too much totally meaningless scenes and then they realized that they should actually make some ending to this movie, so they just rushed it and left so many things unexplained. For a teenager movie, this was a failure. Real teenager, however angsty and rebel they are, they are not that stupid. Seriously, don't watch this movie, it's total waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Bad Some Might Enjoy Its Badness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LOL (2012) * (out of 4)Lisa Azuelos remakes her own French movie. This one here has Miley Cyrus playing a teen who seems obsessed with sex, drugs and music, which is something her single mom (Demi Moore) doesn't know about. I'm guessing that's the so-called plot to this film but the truth is that plot and this movie really don't go together. I can't comment on the original film since I haven't seen it yet but this thing here pretty bad but thankfully it's so bad that most people should be able to get a couple good laughs out of it. I think what really kills the movie is the fact that every character from the teens to their parents are just downright idiots. I mean, the Moore character is without question one of the dumbest mothers I've ever seen from any movie. Just watch the way the character pretty much can't put her foot down on anything and the scene where Cyrus talks her out of taking her phone away is just embarrassing. Even worse is a sequence later on when mommy and daughter have it out after mom reads her diary and notices all the things she's been up to. Not only the entire sequence unintentionally funny, the performances by the two actresses is just embarrassing. Cyrus really comes off bad here because she can't handle what limited range the character has. The scenes with her crying are just poorly done and I can't say I believed anything she did here. Moore isn't quite as bad but she's burdened by the horrid character. Even Gina Gershon, Ashley Greene and Thomas Jane can't do anything. Everything from the dialogue to the actual story is just really bad and there's really nothing good to mention here outside the use of a certain Rolling Stones song. What keeps LOL watchable is how bad it manages to be and I'm going to guess that the only people this thing will appeal to are those who enjoy movies that are so bad they're watchable.</fullReview>

The character of Lola is so unlikable and unrealistic... when, in this movie, does anyone ever call her "Lol"? Her boyfriend is a total cliché and I can guarantee you that no teenage boy in high school acts like that unless they're at the bottom of the food chain.Please skip this film if you're looking for something enjoyable. It's a little ironic that a comedy titled "LOL" will never make you laugh out loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LOLThe best part of texting while walking is the protective bubble it creates around you, staving off danger.LOL! This dramedy isn't about distracted pedestrians surviving collisions with LRT, but the tribulations of the e-generation.Lola (Miley Cyrus) is a contemporary teenager. She communicates via characters and has a super cute BF (George Finn).But when he cheats on her, she hooks up with his friend (Douglas Booth), who is lusted after by Lola's nemesis (Ashley Greene).Meanwhile, Lola's single-mother (Demi Moore) finds her diary and decides to cancel her class trip to Paris. All the while juggling her ex (Thomas Jane) and her younger crush (Jay Hernandez).Though it attempts to be a comedic commentary on today's parent/child relationships, this American version of a French film is merely a vapid snapshot of this electronic epoch.On the bright side, Miley Cyrus texting is less annoying than Miley Cyrus talking.

		<fullReview>This movie doesn't even deserve that 1 star I gave it, IT IS HIDEOUS! I saw it was from Miley Cyrus and I thought gee maybe she'll prove me wrong since I saw the Last Song and prove she is a good actress, surprise I was wrong! The acting is corny and the story line lacks a good plot, watching this I didn't even get the point of it, it had around three problems going on that were solved half an hour after being presented which made me feel that the movie was three hours long. I couldn't wait for it to finish!! This movie is an insult to the filming industry and to film as an art, seriously. Not even teenage girls would watch this. I kept wanting to punch Miley Cyrus in the face cause she was (surprise) the main character, Lola who is popular kid that has a VERY easy life and can't see it, her problems are stupid and nonscencential. I kept wanting to cut Demi Moore's hair cause it was always a so long and messy. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack, and I mean it, music was excellent, rest of movie sucked. Oh. and if you do end up watching this... I pity you for starters and good luck getting used to the horrible fake accent Miley does, I am not even from the US or Canada or the UK and I speak better English than her!</fullReview>

Yes, Hannah Monatana was then but she just is not a good actress this is a complete embarrassment and after watching this movie I would recommend it to no one at all other then die-hard Miley Cryus fans which I also believe will be completely embarrassed that they walked into that cinema.I work at the cinema's and have a fair few people already asking for refund as they did not enjoy watching such a terrible movie.

		<fullReview>Now, I wouldn't call this movie necessarily a bad one but it in fact is lacking a purpose and doesn't make a point or has a clear message in it, in any way or form.Quite frankly, I just can't understand how adults could be involved with this movie. It's a movie about teenagers, so its set in a teenage world, with teenage rules. It's about the sort the sort of the stuff that only seems to be important when you are still at a young age and far from adulthood. Well, I say teenagers but of course all of them are being played by some 20-year old's, which is something pretty obvious and annoying about this movie as well.And really, this entire movie seems to about a bunch of non-issues. I just don't see what the big 'conflict' is supposed to be in this movie and there is just never any sense of true drama in the movie. This is mostly what makes this movie such a pointless watch. Crazy thing about the movie is that you can watch just and only the first 5 and last 5 minutes of this movie and you won't feel like you missed anything because of the simple reason that you also haven't done so. The characters and situations are still being mostly the same at the end of the movie. Perhaps they could had still made this movie somewhat interesting by making it a coming-of-age movie but all this movie seemed to be concerned about was appealing to young teens, who perhaps will be able to identify with some of the characters and situations in this movie but I just can't even imaging them being all that entertained by this movie. There is just far too little happening for that.It's also a movie that confuses and does some stupid things. I swear at first I thought that some of the characters were 'bad guys' but as the movie progressed it suddenly became apparent to me that they were part of the friend-group of the movie and you were even supposed to like these characters. And that's also a problem of the movie. Most of the character aren't really being sympathetic enough to ever care for or be interested enough in.Also an odd thing to see some big name actors in a movie like this. Demi Moore, Thomas Jane, Gina Gershon, Jay Hernandez, all play some quite big parts. Perhaps they were just eager to appear in a Miley Cyrus movie, who is still being a hot young star but isn't exactly known for doing great movies.Pointless movie, that is pointless to watch.4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How and where do I begin to tell you people the horror that is this poorly acted , terribly scripted mess of a 'film'. I never thought I would ever watch a film that would at condone the poor behaviour of miley Cyrus' Character Lola but actually promotes and glorify it. The drug use that Lola partakes in is classified as 'cool' and 'hip' and the consequences of taking drugs are only briefly spoken of , Lola also is a victim of terrible parenting , Demi Moore is a overly touchy-feely mother who loves to indulge in the very acts she so aggressively and rightly condones HYPOCRISY AT IT'S FINEST PEOPLE , Demi Moore and her friends actually smoke pot in the adjoining room from her daughter and Jeremy {friends son} where they to are indulging in this terribly destructive behaviour pattern. Lola is often implied to be just like her mother POOR GIRL her mother is a woman who actually makes no sense as a human... she got a ride home with a COMPLETE STRANGER for peat's sake. Most of the males in this film {In fact all of them} display a chauvinistic view about women which none of them dare to challenge.Also nobody seems to care as to Lolas obvious obsession with technology and her mother fails to tell the father about Lolas self destructiveness and lies to him. MATURITY . Demi Moore portrays {badly} the worst parent ever who finds condoms in the house which her daughter owns along with several used joints and the only punishment is missing a party BUT WAIT ... LOLA GETS TO THE PARTY, Lola lies to her boyfriend and has an overly advanced sex life for her age To conclude this is a very destructive film which promotes behaviour that is self-destructive and harmful without consequence , this would be the last film on earth that i would permit my child to watch and it is in general crappy AVOID AT ALL COSTS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody is annoying in cringe worthy teen melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lola (Miley Cyrus) breaks up with boyfriend Chad (George Finn). She begins to have feelings for her friend Kyle (Douglas Booth). The problem is that her enemy Post-it Ashley (Ashley Greene) keeps trying to steal Kyle. Also Chad and Kyle are best friends which makes it even worst as Chad turns into a jealous douche. Her friend Emily (Ashley Hinshaw) tries to flirt with the hot teacher. She's frustrated that her mother Anne (Demi Moore) is secretly dating her dad Allen (Thomas Jane). Anne is desperate to reconnect with Lola. Anne breaks up with Allen and starts dating James the cop (Jay Hernandez). Lola mistakenly thinks that Kyle had sex with Ashley in the bathroom and tries to get back at him by pretending to date her friend Jeremy (Jean-Luc Bilodeau).This is overloaded with really hot twentysomethings passing themselves off as teenagers. The guys with model good looks could possibly pass. Miley Cyrus and Jean-Luc Bilodeau are probably the only ones that should still be in a high school drama. The rest of them seems to be waiting for a catalog shoot. I try very hard to overlook the double mess of Miley and Demi Moore's real lives. It's a losing proposition. They can't really get away from their persona. This is a movie in need of gritty reality if it could ever work at all. Neither of them can give the movie that reality. The worst is that everybody is various degrees of annoying. As for the story itself, it's a lot of teen melodrama. That's the reason it needs its realism. With so much drama, the movie can only work if it isn't so Hollywood. Instead, the jokes are bad and this is nothing but a bad teen soap opera. I don't know if the French movie was any better. I doubt it could have been much worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't mince words. This is the worst movie about teenagers I've ever seen. Now, objectively, there have been other "worse" teen sex movies, like the innumerable American Pie sequels, but this one is offensive because of the fact that it so obviously has pretensions to be a generation defining examination of the sexual politics of high schoolers. But contrasting this film to even the Tina Fey penned "Mean Girls", almost a decade this film's junior, LOL absolutely pales in comparison. Now, I'm willing to give Lisa Azuelos some credit. I have not seen her original 2008 French film, and maybe it's good. Maybe it is the sharp edged satire that this film failed to be. Maybe something was lost in the translation to English. Maybe, lines such as "Skank-ass ho" don't engender the kind of bad laughs in French as they do in English. But, ultimately, the faults in this movie have to come down to her screenplay. Character motivations change every minute, plot lines are introduced, dropped, only to be either picked up again at a point when it's convenient for the film or just abandoned outright. The casting was atrocious. Miley Cyrus cannot act. Not that any other actress would have much luck trying to breathe life into this rotting , personality-void corpse of a character, whose only motivation in life seems to be deciding between two nearly identical wispy haired low-rent Cilian Murphy lookalike she's gonna give her V-card to. But give the artist formerly known as Hannah Montana some credit, at least she looks like a teenager! The absolutely goose-bump inducing storyline involving the blonde wanting to bump hormonal uglies with her math teacher fails to capture the creepiness and desperation of the situation if only for the fact that the two actors look about six months apart in age! Not that any of that matters, as this plot thread, like so many others, comes to a complete halt with no resolution, no consequence, and no lessons learned. And that's the biggest problem with this movie, it gives us absolutely no reason to care at all about the people in it. Why should I care about Lola's love life? What about this cop am I supposed to find charming apart from his motorcycle and leather jacket? Why should I like Kyle as opposed to the other guy?(I can't remember his name, and no, I won't look it up because I've already spent an hour and a half of my life on this movie, and that's about two hours too long.) Demi Moore is the only one in this movie that comes across as credible. She's believable as a single mom trying to have a family and a career(What career, you ask? Good question, we're never told.). This movie is a complete mess of half-baked ideas trying to say something profound about the Twitter generation. Take my advice: watch Mean Girls or Fast Times at Ridgemont High, two films that despite their age have as much to say about teenagers in their time as they do now. And I guarantee you won't have to hear the line "skank-ass ho" in either of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is lucky to even be getting a 1/10 from me. I sadly did watch the whole thing, and it was an absolute load of rubbish in my opinion. The acting was rather horrendous, the script was awful and the overall plot...I can't think of a nice way to put it. If this is what our society thinks is a good way for teenagers in this generation to act, it needs fixing now. The main character (played by Miley Cyrus) threw a tantrum because her mother read her diary and found out that she was sleeping with someone, she packed her bags and went to live with her dad. This is definitely not how teenagers should be acting. Teenagers need to learn to take responsibility for their actions, not jump to conclusions before they've heard the whole story. And they definitely shouldn't expect to get whatever they want, whenever they want just because they want it. Which is exactly what this movie is portraying. Basically showing young girls that they can disrespect themselves and their family, be rude and impolite to those who love them just because they didn't get what they wanted. Spoilt little brats. I would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone, it's sending the wrong message. Especially to teenage girls. Horribly horrendous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of these reviews do sound a bit like old people who don't understand youth culture. There is a lot of moaning about 'these kids with cell phones constantly in their face'. The problem is that this film fails to challenge that image at all. I understand that the way teenagers communicate has changed. They use internet slang in person, they are on social media a lot and always using a smart-phone. It makes sense for films to reflect that.The problem is that this film is total tripe, regardless.The acting is horrendous on all sides, particularly Cyrus who clearly already passed the limits of her acting talent in Hannah Montana and needs to just jack it in. How Demi Moore got involved in this I do not know. Sure, she's done some bad movies in the past but I thought she was older and wiser now. Apparently not.I not only failed to empathise with any of these people, I actively started to dislike all of them for being so woefully one dimensional. If you have a teenage daughter, or even just know a teenage girl, ask her about her life at school or the boys she likes. I guarantee it will be more interesting and engaging than the plot of this film.I actually consider this film does more harm than good to the very people it portrays. It could have been an insight into the, sometimes impenetrable, world of teenage life. It could have shown parents or other adults how things have changed since their youth and why social media is so important to teenagers these days. Instead it just reinforces the image that they are shallow, whiny, and entitled 'kids' with no perspective on the real world.I would say this is just for hardcore Miley Cyrus fans but actually it's more likely to upset you if you liked her before. It's not for anyone, simple as that.</fullReview>

The teenagers apparently all have trust issues and act like the cover page of People Magazine, who did who with what mostly and live only through their communication systems. Miley's character acts bipolar (although who are we to judge upon the severity of mental issues) during most of the film, if not for all of it. The obvious morality stints of teen sex and drugs is brought in a way where only the superfluous banality of it remains. That criticism is coming from a moderate consumer of said herbs and an inveterate cheater movie addict who mostly watches John Waters and Kevin Smith films... It's a sad day for teen movies. Where are the complex intertwining motives "? la" John Hugues, or the ironic yet quite serious movie making of Amy Heckerling? The parents are a) too lenient or b) harsh Nazi like figures of pseudo authority. By pushing his kid, one of the fathers actually commits a felony. 2/10... Because although it is pure Hollywood (I appeal to the masses of tweens that want to see Justin Bieber replicas have sex in a school bathroom types), some effort of formal cinematography can be sometimes perceived, the images of the cities and urban milieu are somewhat okay.

There is no way in hell that these kids would be hanging out with that many hot girls. The group of friends that is portrayed in this awful film would never be considered the cool kids at this school. Not once in this movie are these kids actually bullied. Why do these movies portray the cool kids in high school to be a bunch of whiny artsy kids who complain all the time and constantly look like they are about to cry? Not one person I have ever met has ever acted like these kids in high school. Not only did I hate every character in this movie, but I hated every word that came out of every stupid mouth. The dialogue seemed to have been written by a thirteen year-old girl who is trying to sound sexually mature. I felt like this (presumed) thirteen-year-old girl writer just wrote one draft to this script and that was that, the first draft was the final draft. I was so confused as why people got together or why they broke up or why they got back together. Things would happen with zero explanation to it. Why did Lola and Kyle make-up with no words spoken while on the plane to Paris. They broke up for no reason then got back together for no reason. Then out of nowhere Lola appears to become a lesbian with that blonde haired girl but they never address that relationship. Also, at the beginning of the movie Lola says that Kyle was her best friend all her life but at the end of the stupid movie she introduces him to her mom. HOW HAVE THEY NEVER MET IF HE HAS BEEN LOLA'S BEST FRIEND ALL HER LIFE. This movie is the worst movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many bad things I could say about this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say this...this movie lacked plot. I watched about 30 minutes of it wondering when it was going to get good. So I decided to watch the whole thing it never had a plot. That is probably what bothered me the most. However I am not going to slam down as a god awful movie either because I have seen worse. Let me tell you what is good about it or what I really think the writers and makers of this movie were going for. First the movie showed what teenage life is like now. With social media, texting, partying, drinking, drugs and relationships: It was not sugar coded material which is nice I guess. Second, It had some relate to characters. Lola, being a teen trying to live her own life. A mother trying to deal with being a single parent. I would some what say they did a fair job at that. However there is so much bad you can say about this movie. Even though I thought Miley was great in The Last Song however I think her acting days are numbered. I also think her singing career is to but hey this about her acting. I felt like she could have given more to her character as Lola. I also think they lack of character develop could had done that. Again I could say so many bad things about this movie you can read other reviews on their experience of this movie. In short, I would not recommend this movie on less you want to watch something just because. I would recommend Cyperbully which has Emily Osment as the lead. Very emotional movie and a great example what social media is like these days.</fullReview>

They have fights with their parents that don't really amount to much. The end of the film is a concert (because one of the kids is totally deep and emo enough to be in a band) and you can tell by the music that you're supposed to be satisfied. I wasn't. Nobody was. Nothing happened in this film. Complete lack of conflict and resolution. There wasn't even very much coming of age. This movie might have been interesting if they had worked in a rap battle, kidnapping, depraved love triangle, or even just one antagonist. ANYTHING! It felt like watching really elaborate CCTV. Probably kill yourself before attempting to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the worst piece of sh*t I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the direction (if you could even call it that) is awful, and the story is down right unrealistic, pretentious, and ridiculous. Every minute that I sat through this garbage I was pondering whether or not to scratch my eyes out of my head or jump off of the tallest building I could find, neither of which would have taken this movie to the burners. Miley Cyrus is by far the WORST actress of all time, narrowly beating the entire cast of The Room for that title. Demi Moore is completely idiotic in this film, trying her best to portray a mother but only falters as the task despite being a mother herself to children in the same age bracket. The supporting cast, made up of Thomas Jane, Jay Hernandez, Fisher Stevens and Gina Gershon try to elevate this direct to DVD film with an unsuccessful result. The film's story is horrendous, it tries to convey high school filled with overbearing clichés that have been done better and more tastefully in other previous films. Overall, STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM!!!! It should come with a warning on the DVD case reading: MAY CAUSE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. Yes, it is THAT bad. You've been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awful. There were some funny parts. Lucky for Miley - her's was more natural than demi's performance. The relationship between these 2 seemed forced. I never forgot for the entire movie that they were Miley and Demi trying to look hot. What mother with long hair never puts her hair up to take care of children, make food etc? I couldn't really get into the movie or identify with any of the characters except perhaps some of Miley's girlfriends in the movie, they did a good job acting. Sounds like the original version was a hit. This version was vacuous and boring. I actually didn't care by the end of the movie if anyone ended up together. I couldn't wait until it was over. I couldn't get netflix to fast forward so I just sat through until the end. These stars need to stop believing their own press releases. If you're done acting then just do talk shows; Miley could fall back on her music career. Demi was great in the Joneses movie; so perhaps they have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the movie with an opened mind. I usually don't like Miley Cyrus as an actress and usually won't waste my time watching films or shows she's been in, but I do enjoy movies with Douglas Booth and Ashley Greene. So, I began watching the movie and it seemed like it showed promise as being an original (or slightly original) movie (even though it's an American adaption of a French film). Then it got really cliché really fast. I was able to predict exactly what was going to happen before it happened and it was just so ridiculous. I literally fast forwarded at times and wasn't lost in the slightest. It had soooo much promise. Had they tweaked it slightly it would've been such a better film. Maybe if they had dipped into Kyle's home life a little more or spent less time on Lola's friend. It felt like none of the stories they were bringing in really made sense or mattered. It was just splotches of a teenagers daily life without the depth of meaning to it. It portrayed a true relationship between friends, enemies, love interests, and parents; even if Lola and Kyle's friendliness was a little stressed and the interest in each other too obvious in the beginning. Honestly I was more interested in Kyle's home life then I was in Lola's. And the movie was in Lola's POV. (for most of the movie) Maybe if they'd added some confrontation with Kyle and Chad about his and Lola's relationship or gave SOMETHING that wasn't so dry. You really only get the face value and some slight shallow depth to each of the teenagers when the movie could have been so much more. The people who worked on the film state the movie didn't do well at the box office because of the lack of publicity it got, but that wasn't it at all. It was because they had an amazing cast with a lacking story line that didn't make the audience care. What person wants to waste money on a movie they can see in a million other B movies that go straight to DVD?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Show me the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off Miley Cyrus' acting is always upsettingly bland. It seems like she just enjoys pretending to be a 'bad girl'. The plot line its self didn't even go anywhere. Nothing was resolved or overcome. It seems like they just took a chapter out of this girls diary and said "lets make this a movie". The only thing close to a climax is when the mother reads the girls diary and that is quickly overcome. I think the goal of the movie was to draw parallels between the mother and daughter, which they do with a bunch of unnecessary plot lines. It jumps around from one thing to the next. Plus they put too much attention on the irrelevant details that it confuses you to the actual plot line (Which is nonexistent). They show you a little of her boyfriends homelike (where nothing is changed or achieved) and the mothers love life (where she just jumps around). I feel like a plot should go somewhere, especially side plots. Movies should feel like you're taking a journey from start to finish and this feels like it started in the middle and ended shortly after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caution! This review contains spoilers in the 'About the film itself' section, but nowhere else! First things first: I know I'm not the person who this film is aimed to. Here comes the but though.--About Miley Cyrus: She seems to struggle to find her way after the Hannah Montana series and albums, and maybe to show her dad (Billy Ray Cyrus) that she is fine on her own. Not a waste of talent, because she hasn't got any in this sort of medium.Well, according to the re-created LOL she is not that fine. I completely understand that she doesn't want to be a Disney minion for ever, but this fake rebel chick and the whole world is against she is just not cool. Seriously why is she doing this? She got too much before she could understand the responsibility which comes with being celebrity.--About everyone else: I don't know how could Cyrus force Demi Moore to take the role in this film but hey, she managed to, and it works for some reason. Demi Moore just does what she is great at. Scores 4 out of 5 for me.--Young female actresses: Average performance and nothing else. Except for Lina Esco, who portrayed the American version of Stéphanie (Lou Lesage). Even though in the 2012 version the girls did not have such a big role as in the original, she made a good impersonation. (3 out of 5) Male actors: The class mates were just like the original ones, maybe a bit less hip, to "make them able to be sold".--About the film itself (containing info about locations): The story has been rewritten to fit into the line of the below average American re-created films. Instead of Paris they gave Chicago, instead of England they gave Paris.--Verdict: Below average acting, absolutely unnecessary remake, the only market share it can hold to is the American. For some reason they love to ruin the European films. The only exception in the near past was so far the the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. IMDb score for the original: 7.8, US version 7.9. As for the LOL, figures are not so great. The original has a score of 6.1, the US version 3.5 and it won't be any better.--For me: 2 out of 10, and I was really kind because I liked Demi Moore and Lina Esco.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it's not going to be a long review, this film simply doesn't even worth my time writing one. The only reason I bother is to warn whoever didn't see this movie yet not to make my mistake. Where to even start.. I don't understand why Miley keeps getting lead roles, she just doesn't know how to act, like a little girl who tries to act in front of her mirror and it really doesn't work well.. In addition to that, the story itself is so boring! I'm from those who always get emotional when I watch films (even really bad ones) but here it was worse than bad, I didn't feel anything and the only reason I laughed a few times was because of the amount of ridiculously stupid scenes that were in this film. I won't even go on, my point is clear - Do yourself a favor - Don't watch this. I needed another good movie after this just to get over it. My brain couldn't tolerate such a disaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing. It's such a shame up and coming and talented actors such as Booth became involved in this project. I hope it doesn't harm any future opportunities.The plot is a mess. It has some interesting concepts but none of them were developed well enough for them to be relevant to the story. The storyline was all over the place and the first half seemed like a never ending commercial for Apple. If the writers had taken the time to develop the characters instead of relying on their good looks to win us over then this venture would have been more of a success. I didn't care about any of the characters and despised Cyrus' character Lol. (I am not a Miley hater by the way, I tried so hard to like her character in this film. I'm not commenting on her acting ability either, she really wasn't given much to play with here) She was empty, shallow, vapid and spoilt and I couldn't empathize with her in the slightest, she had no depth to her and no personality. The themes were vague. I wish they had spent more time creating decent dialogue instead of relying on wishy washy montages. It just wasn't coherent and to watch was completely frustrating. To say this film is about a mother that discovers her teenager's diary is misleading also as this literally happens in the last 15 minutes and is quickly resolved. There was no real relationship between the two anyway so this seemed like a pointless way of injecting some actual action in to the story as it feels like nothing really happens.They could have easily just focused on one theme- either the friendship and development of a relationship with one of her best friends (they didn't even seem like best friends to begin with? we just had to rely on "He's been my friend for a really long time" quote) or the relationship between a mother and daughter (they didn't seem to have one either?) or this "reliance on technology" thing that wasn't even that prominent. It was just irritating and annoying to see them text each other all of the time. It was like an excessively long phone commercial. It just seemed like this aspect was added so the film makers could claim this is what their film was about. The more I write the more frustrated I become. I don't know. I'd just avoid it. A complete mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I see Cyrus name in a film title I'm prone to think "O' Gawd!" in knowing what might be to come. Sadly, by watching this movie - once again I was proved right.First of all though its not Cyrus's fault (partly). The film is just dreary and trying. The usual mush and fodder for the brain-dead. Who writes this rubbish? Same old, same old regurgitated worn out, tired sentimental teen mush. Has movie writers (the cheaper ones obviously) just decided to throw out this crap and think "O well Cyrus is in it so people will want to view it!" - have they?Go watch the original French version first - not this (once again) crappy version made by America as they rip yet another film off ...badly!Cyrus might be able to act by the way - but as in this, she has once again yet to step up and do anything that could be called decent and memorable. Once again, she is going through the acting class manual and it shows. Frankly, this is night viewing maybe on the Disney channel but thats about the height of it.This film might entertain a 15 year old for a while but thats it. The day Cyrus is away from crap like this and goes do a decent adult film (not necessarily meaning she has to remove her clothes) is not a day too soon. Junk like this is doing her no credit. Its run of the mill stuff but then so far, so is her acting. She needs to get serious and step her act up - literally!</fullReview>

Normally I can appreciate an entertaining but not particularly profound romantic comedy, but everyone has a breaking point - I could not watch more than 45 minutes of this trainwreck of a film. The plot moves far too fast and builds up no momentum, yet sprinkles in pointless montages that make absolutely no sense. Incessant plot holes render the entire film a ludicrous farce and a complete waste of time. I normally never write reviews but this was so terrible I felt compelled to warn humanity against ever setting eyes on this film.</fullReview>

If this came from Hollywood, it makes me wonder what those in Hollywood think about contemporary culture in the USA. Maybe that was their goal, to showcase the failures and superficial nature of the current youth of America. If that was indeed their goal, they did a good job. But more likely, they intended this to be an edgy teen movie to be consumed by the younger masses. It fails there too though. The conflicts between the characters are weak, and not compelling, to each their own, I just couldn't get into it. I think they could have done a better job of building at least one like-able character that viewers could identify with, but it never happens.</fullReview>

This "piece of cinema" disappoints more when the story, supposedly, have a connection with social media, and I didn't see that issue treated throughout. As a viewer, I was expecting a little more of deepness in the characters. The social relations between Miley Cyrus character and the teens involved seems too predictable, flat and empty. The student that has a crush on a teacher is a cliché theme, that don't bring nothing new. Besides, the relationship mother-daughter appears too artificial. And that attempt to change the curse of the story with a trip, turn out to not adding anything relevant. Over all, I think this movie don't show any innovation, and don't provide any learning to a viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty weak yet with some brief good moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me clarify one thing first. I'm giving thumbs down to this movie not because of the people involved and the already known lack of consideration most people have with teen stars like Cyrus, but because this movie is weak. Here's a comedy/romance/drama flick that doesn't add anything new to anything.What can I say? It's a little torturing to see the adventures and misfortunes of poor rich girl Lola (Miley Cyrus), known as LOL among their friends. "LOL" draws a colorful and clichéd portrait of being a teenager in the 21st century and how relationships are constructed with cellphones, computers, text messages, etc and etc, how they deal with their parents, their colleagues, friends and teachers, boyfriends and girlfriends. How new is that? Most of the time you just sit there and watch in a complete state of embarrassment all the up's and down's of the main character while trying to make things done, a very unnecessary emotional roller-coaster that predictably ends with everything going well and everybody being friends of everybody after spending most of the movie battling each other.For those who think five stars is too much, I say it's not. There's some enjoyable things in here. When the movie isn't focusing on Lola, we have time to spend along with her mom (played by Demi Moore, still stunning after all these years) having good dates with a younger cop (Jay Hernandez), her first encounters after divorcing from her husband (Thomas Jane). The movie tries to establish a parallel between mom and daughter in showing how similar they are but that doesn't work much because one is interesting to follow while the other is not. The parties Lola's mom has with her friends are so much fun, the adults dialogs are far more engaging than the ones Lola and her friends have. The presence of the veteran actors (Moore, Fisher Stevens, Nora Dunn and others) makes this a little nice to watch. Better than they are Cyrus's partners Douglas Booth (playing her friend who later becomes the boyfriend) and sadly underused in this movie Jean-Luc Bilodeau (playing her "backup" boyfriend, used to cause jealous on the first when they broke up). If you're not gonna enjoy the story, the clichés and the ridiculous parts at least there's some hot guys to stare at it.To me, "LOL" was exactly like watch the long and endless TV series "Malhaç?o", very popular in here since 1994 and still goes on, changing cast but presenting the exact same story with the main focus on teens. I admit, the series were quite good up until the beginning of the 2000's, then it became all downhill, infuriatingly repetitive and no longer dealing with serious issues that concerns many young people out there. It's all about rich kids and their fake romances, having party after party, carrying a certain sense of positivism that isn't so present in youth. It's annoying. More annoying than everything here was being forced to hear a French version of "Alright", whatever that band is, they ruined Supergrass classic. Too bad that the negative aspects overcome the very few positive ones, it's just cheap and quite non involving. It's not a good suggestion to go watch it only for the brief decent moments but if interested, go ahead. You've been warned. There's worst out there but it's certain that there are great things out there waiting to be discovered. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly the most awful movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a terrible, nonsensical, unnecessarily extended plot line, juvenile dialogues and laughable characters, this movie really takes the cake for one of the most awful 93 minutes of my life.I honestly felt as though I was watching a visual representation of a teen-drama Wattpad novel, authored by a tween. The movie is as if directed by a 12 year old. It's not just that the story line is removed from reality, it's that it is painfully so. One of the things that bothered me about the movie was that it portrayed teen relationships and beahaviour as so stereotypical and centred around the clichéd "sex, drugs and rock and roll" theme. This, among other things in the movie was so removed from reality that it was irritating. Another thing was, it showed female best friends (NOT in a romantic relationship) casually making out on a daily basis as a greeting and it being perceived as completely normal by everyone else in the film. It's a part of the whole "removed from reality thing" but very vexing to watch, just the same.If I could give it less than one star, I would. Absolute waste of time and reel.</fullReview>

Miley has 2 "sensual" scenes in bed nothing crazy graphic, it's shown she still has her bra on in both moments. Cyrus is seen kissing another girl for .1 second and that's it/ nothing crazy graphic. Dialague: Cyrus's Brizillian is brought up once. Teenage sexuality is referenced for a moment. Mild references are made between girls, not crazy much.

		<shortDescription>Doesn't Have That Much Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lola (Miley Cyrus) is a teenage student at a high school in Chicago who lives with her mother, "Anne" (Demi Moore). She has a few friends at the school and when she isn't hanging out with them she stays in contact through her cell phone or laptop computer. At the beginning of the new school year she is devastated when her boyfriend, "Chad" (George Finn) tells her that he was sleeping with someone else during the summer vacation and that he now wants to breakup. Rather than admit that she was alone during this time she tells him that she had also been sleeping with someone. He then begins to treat her like a slut which makes their breakup even worse. Fortunately, her friends "Emily" (Ashley Henshaw) and "Kyle" (Douglas Booth) are there for her and help her get over the breakup. However, during this time she begins to fall in love with Kyle which results in another problem down the line caused inadvertently by Emily. At any rate, as far as this movie is concerned, although it is billed as a comedy-drama-romance it actually doesn't have that much comedy. At least there wasn't much humor that I could see. Additionally, the plot was rather thin and some of the scenes seemed to drag here and there. But Miley Cyrus performed rather well and Ashley Henshaw certainly added to the scenery. Even so, neither one of these qualities were enough to elevate this film into the average range. That said, although it may appeal to a younger audience I rate this film as slightly below average.</fullReview>

She played the role, perfectly. A lot of likable people in this movie, including Demi Moore. And I have to say, the other actors aren't half bad, either. For this movie, I felt like movies similar to this have the same acting, I mean, I know a lot of you are sour and old, but yeah. Whatever, this movie features a lot of eye candy, amazing music, and some pretty heart warming, amazing moments that make you feel happy.Okay, so let's all hate on a movie because we don't like it and felt no connection to it, if you're a 40 year old feeling some sort of connection to this movie, you are either going through a mid-life crisis, or you might need some serious help.Perhaps reading the plot before, "wasting," your time, would help you in the long run. Ever heard of YouTube, trailers? But of course, it's so much fun to write a long and boring review because hating is fun &amp; because they probably don't really have a relationship like the ones featured in the movie or even a life to begin with, right? Yes!Perhaps you superior critics should make your own movie? I would love to write a review for that.So, to sum it all up, boring people with no personality + a movie revolving the life of a teenage girl who has loads of parties, gets drunk, kissed a few guys, basically doing what any other normal Teenage girl would do, equals a bunch of bad and just completely annoying reviews.I will probably get a lot of down votes for this, and probably even have a lot of you thinking, "well, you're busy wasting your time writing a review, too." Well, this is my first review and I'm no expert. I tend to enjoy the movie more than trashing it.Learn to live a little, and I still don't understand why some of you watched this movie, so funny! Please, just stay away from the movies reserved for cool kids and perhaps focus on some boring drama that will stimulate you're oh so magnificent and intellectual mind.That's all, bye bye haters :) Have fun wasting more time on writing long boring reviews :P &lt;3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Guess This is the Life of a Normal Teenager, Right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film compares school life to modern society. Even though 1/4 of us are on the internet every day, sometimes it can affect our grades. In my opinion, school is a place where you can learn and get a good education. Other students think it is a place to party.Miley Cyrus, who portrays Lola in the film, does OK in her acting. She dumps her Hannah Montana image for a more mature look. She overreacts in boozing, drugs, and sex. I think this is what inspired her to wear racy outfits and twerk at her concerts.Anyway, the film contains some violence and LOTS of sex and language (let's not forget the drinking, drugs, and smoking part). A father gets angry at his son for getting poor grades, pushes him, and smashes his guitar. In this film, teens engage in various levels of sexuality- from daydreaming about the attractive math teacher to discussing hookups to passionate making out and losing their virginity. There is lots of teen cursing in this movie. They include "stupid", "shut up", and "screw you". Lola calls her mother a b---- to her face. There is also regular marijuana and alcohol consumption by teens.Even though teens have a lot of OMG! moments in their lives, they make good choices and bad choices. If you plan on doing drugs, PLEASE think twice about going the wrong path (after watching the movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical Coming-of-age Kinda Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*I don't know how you probably got here, but if you are looking for ACTION/ FANTASY/ADVENTURE/ Sci-Fi/ Rom-Com/ HORROR movie in this one, then I've got a word for you, "GET OUT!" You don't really want to watch this movie.*If you find this movie silly in the first fifteen minutes, then you may not really be into it throughout.*If you liked movies, like "the Last Song", "According to Greta", "Remember Me" and other similar movies, with lots of DRAMA. Then you can watch it, if you are okay with Miley Cyrus, not that great of a Demi Moore and your typical Coming-of-age kinda of movie, then you should probably stick around.*If you aren't approving/comfortable with topics of Sex, drugs and you- know-where-else-I'm probably going with this, then you probably shouldn't watch it.In my opinion, most of the reviews concerned with this film were quite harsh. In truth, the film isn't filled with the perfect story line, with a nail-biting plot or anything. *Like I said, it's a coming-of-age kinda movie and you will enjoy this movie if you've liked other films similar to it like, maybe 'According to Greta, the Last Song and other movies that have the similar theme.*The 'Naration' is sort of tacky and the actors may not have brilliant acting skills, well, in my opinion.*Miley Cyrus over does it at times. And then again, she underplays it sometimes. True to rumours, she does try hard to get out of her 'Hannah Montana' shoes and has tried a more maybe-not-really 'mature' look with this one. All the kissing and the sleeping around speak for that. Nevertheless, I'm don't fan girl or hate on her, so I didn't find her role play that hard to digest, as most other "Hannah Montana" fans might.*You'll find yourself deeply moved by Douglas Booth's role, that's if you have a 'thing' for men, otherwise you'll see that he's just a good- looking guy with average acting skills, well, at least in this movie.*The character of Lola, is pretty well-established, she's rebellious, dubious, confused, she's secretive, loves her mother and is pretty much your average teenager. Meaning to say, your average-unrealistic, drama queenish-ignorant, movie-kinda-teen. *Demi Moore's role may not be the typical control-freak-mum, as much as you might think while watching the movie. I'm not too sure if her role required exceptional acting skills or not, but to me, she really didn't seem to have taken much of an effort. But then again, this was my first movie with Demi Moore in it, so I won't judge. Okay, maybe not too much.* It's NOT one of the greatest movies of all time.*You should probably go sleep, if you're actually taking time off to watch a movie like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and I don't get why it's rated so low or why so many of the reviews are negative. Of course everybody has their opinions, but I feel like all this hate towards the movie is based on some people's hate for Miley Cyrus, which is completely unnecessary. I loved the movie and I recommend it to parents and, especially, teenagers. I also think that, if you watch the movie,you shouldn't think about the bad or the good reviews.

		<fullReview>OK so i watch both version and i really don't understand the hard review sure not best movie ever and there are some moments that i don't like (like the fact that if my boyfriend would have told me that he cheated on me just to try it i will slap in the face and send him to hell,definitely not saying yeah i did too) but i enjoy it. I like slightly Better the french version it looks more real and the friends have more screen time. A thing that i didn't like of both version is that some of the friends situation with their parents are left hanging,but i guess the point was that adults are different and would never understand teens. The acting of the American version not that bad sure like i said not the greatest movie of all time but people come on this a teen chick flick what did you aspect...p.s. i wish there was more Emily and Wen screen time in both version. I would totally love a movie with the main couple like Wen and Emily or their french version Charlotte and Paul-henry....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story was quite good but I have to say that Miley Sirus should stick with singing. She is not the best actor and definitely took away a few stars from this movie. Aside from that, I don't know why everyone is hating on this movie. I thought that it should have been funnier for a movie that was categorized under comedy and I found Miley's random talking during the movie quite distracting and annoying.I, although, haven't seen the French movie that everyone is saying that this is a total remake of, so I can't compare it to anything. I still think that it wasn't awful, but wasn't great either so I'd give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have sucky taste, because this movie got an average of 3.6 and I loved it! I give it an 8. It was definitely cheesy, and you could predict what would happen, but I loved it anyways. I didn't watch it for an engaging plot, but rather for a warm fuzzy feeling and on that it delivered. I loved the mother/daughter relationship, it seems so real and true to life to me. And Lola's relationship with Kyle was super cute. I don't know, it wasn't a life changing movie but it made me laugh and smile goofily and the screen so I think it was a success. I just really liked it, and I watch it over again from time to time to get those warm fuzzies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miley Cyrus believable as troubled teen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ran across LOL on Netflix. I'd heard about the movie earlier and wanted to see it, however it never made it to theaters around me and I never caught it on TV. The story is basic: a girl with divorced parents is trying to find herself among various influences. She does drugs, thinks about sex all the time, and drinks. She goes against her mother's wishes and throws a big party. Mind you, she maintains a very strong relationship with her mom through the movie's entirety.Miley Cyrus isn't the best actress, but her role as Lola was believable. I felt like she was Lola and her emotions were in tact.I would compare this movie to Perks of Being a Wallflower in that teens are trying to find who they are among the pressure to drink, pressure to smoke, pressure to have sex, and most of all the pressure of parents to be perfect.I definitely would recommend this movie. I enjoyed it. Not for anyone under, say, 15, but a good movie overall.5/10 because I felt like there could be more action. The whole movie was just about her drinking, smoking, and trying to get revenge on her ex Chad. Even when she goes to Paris, she's just trying to have sex with her boyfriend. Lola needs a life that has adventure and she needs to put up the bottles and blow out the joint!</fullReview>

I thought they were good actors and sold the story, I loved the layout and all the events, I was either crying, cheering, or sitting on the edge of my seat.

		<shortDescription>I really loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't watch movies that have ratings under 5, but I didn't even check up on this one, I just saw it... and I really loved it! The story flows quickly and when I first saw the opening scene I wasn't expecting much, but it was totally worth it. I saw a lot of bad comments and reviews after I saw the movie, but the fact is, it is painting a picture of a reality we're living in. You can say all you want about how this movie was about Facebooking, texting, using the internet and technology, but the fact is you wouldn't even have written all of these reviews if it wasn't for the technology. It is what it is, and we can discuss about it forever, but the fact is - this is our reality. But, I think the point of this movie was that no matter how much technology takes over our lives, we need to remember that we are human and that we need to appreciate and respect each other. The reality we're living in isn't perfect, and that technology taking over isn't not that good thing, but we can't stop it from happening and we just have to use it in a good way - supporting each other with it, being there for each other and respect the values of life. I don't want to push it much further than this and write something I'll regret, but all I want to say is - don't be harsh on this one, and give it a chance. It is not actually worth the 10 (excellent) rate, it's more of an 8 or a 7, but I gave it 10 so I can compensate for the bad rating it has and maybe change someone's mind to see it and love it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an upbeat pleasant comedy drama about a teenage girl (Miley) and her single mom (Demi) and their romantic relationships. No one is really evil. It's not that funny as the title would suggest.Miley's love interest is played by Douglas Booth who looks a bit out of her league. Nice to see Ashley Greene as "The Post-it". The dialog is a bit fast to catch. The directing is a bit hectic. It's nice to see a mother and daughter who love each other instead of just fighting.Only problem is the message it's sending - it's okay to have intercourse at that age? Overall it won't go down as the greatest teen movie but it's okay for one watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Under-Rated Film and here's why...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring in her first major film following the hit "Hannah Montana" television series, Miley Cyrus shows to audiences a different side of her. That is why it is easy to see why this film was received so poorly by audiences - this is not a film for the Disney crowd. Instead "LOL" is a complete departure of the wholesome "perfect teen" image of Hannah Montana and instead captures a deeper, truer image of today's average teenager. When viewed in this context, the Hannah Montana fan-base may be disappointed but Miley Cyrus fans will be captivated by her performance and all audiences are sure to agree that "LOL" is a transition for the multi-talented actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LOL is your typical teenage movie. The characters in this movie just experience "normal" teenage problems, however, I feel like these problems aren't the problems an average teenage would face. So, if you're watching this movie for some insight on how to live...turn your back on it. Why? Because the movie focuses more on issues like sex, and drugs. It does focus to some extend on relationships too so that's good. The movie was really well filmed, but the style of filming may have suited a more "deep" story-line rather than this teenage story. I just wish the movie's atmosphere was funner and more alive.This movie turned out to be better than I thought it would be, however, it didn't leave me stunned...I guess this movie is suitable for those boring moments during which you in which you wanna do some dreaded work.</fullReview>

The whole character of Lola is easily identifiable to many people which leads us to want well for her! Lolas' relationship with her mother has a really humbling feeling as well as all the relationship with her friends and the boys! The way this movie is directed captures a great view of American teenage lives as well as the lives of parents which many movies often don't include.All in all this is probably one of my favourite movies of all time and definitely worth a watch!!</fullReview>

I mean, maybe I just loved it because I'm a fourteen year old girl that loves chick flicks, but I thought that the movie was very cute and relate able. Sure, I'm not the biggest Miley fan, but I thought that she was great in the movie and the chemistry that she had with the other actors was amazing, and to me, that made up for the lack of acting ability for most of the actors. When I saw all the awful reviews here, I was hesitant to watch the movie, but I did, mainly because I was bored, and well, Douglas Booth is extremely attractive. But now, I'm glad that I saw the movie and I would definitely watch it again. Not the world's greatest movie, but not the worst either and overall, I really enjoyed it. Definitely the kind of movie to watch with your mom, your best friend, at a sleepover, or even when you're by yourself and bored!

		<fullReview>I can honestly say that when the hype surrounding Miley Cyrus started I wasn't that interested in her. I checked out her TV Shows etc and all I could hear was a nasal-y voice and a girl who was so chirpy it wasn't funny.I love Nicolas Sparks' movies, all of them. Then I found out Miley was in The Last Song and I wasn't too happy but decided to watch cause the guy was a babe. The first few sentences I heard the nasal voice and I was put off but then I continued to listen and it disappeared and it was like her personality came through and really enjoyed it. From then on I liked Miley.I gave LOL a go because I like Chick Flicks and I'm not ashamed to admit it. This movie is pretty similar to real life, just a little more dramatic (as are most movies).I compare this to Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging. Aimed at younger girls but can be enjoyed by all. There were some super cute scenes in it, cute boys and they were addressing issues that are faced by all ages.Definitely not the best movie I've ever seen but I would watch it again for sure!</fullReview>

Even though it has the Worst break-up scene I have ever seen in movie's Histroy". LOL is a story of a teenage girl growing up and falling in love, getting cheated on and dealing with separation of their parents. Miley Cyrus looks chic but I think at times she went overboard plus she is not that great of an actress and since we want strong female actress to lead teen movies she falls short. Douglas Booth is another charming British lad can't wait to see him in Romeo &amp; Juliet. Jessica Hinshaw &amp; Ashley Green are gorgeous. Demi Moore and Jay Hernandez sizzle on screen. Austin Nicoles, Thomas Jane, Jean-Luc Bilodeau and George Finn are fine in it. On the whole, LOL is an enjoyable teen movie with great soundtracks and good production value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I checked the on-line review of this film here at IMDb, I saw all the vitriol and negative reviews (bordering on hatred) and wondered if this film really was that bad. Sure it's Miley Cyrus and Demi Moore, but that doesn't automatically equate to a sh*t film. My reasons for watching this film were in fact to see if it was a train wreck. I was glad to see that it isn't. Yes the acting isn't Astaire, Rogers or Streep- but who cares? The film is watchable for 1.5 hours, even with the less-than-sparkling acting. I gave it a 5 out of 10. I thought from the reviews it would be a -1. I guess it goes to show that just like when we accept people as we find them rather than others impressions, the same goes for films. I wouldn't pay to see this at a cinema. I would wait for this to come to DVD- but if I had paid a cinema, I wouldn't walk out screaming, as I have plenty of times before. With all the Hollywood bullsh*t we public are exposed to, this is far from the worst of it.</fullReview>

I've seen the original LOL (subtitles and all) and I don't understand how this one was "worse" or "mocking" it. I enjoyed it. It was a good way to spend my evening. Miley Cyrus executed her character well. People are giving her a bad rep because of her previous movies; I'm not the biggest fan of hers myself. However, she did well in this movie. It wasn't a hard part to play but she did well. And all the other characters did well too. Between the original movie and this one, nothing was different except that this one was in English and had different actors. This movie won't change your life by all means, but if you're looking for a romantic teen movie to watch, this one will serve you well. It's meant for teens (just like the writer/director envisioned) so don't go in expecting "The Notebook" because it will not give you what you're looking for. I hope this helps.</fullReview>

It isn't. Trust me.I was not super impressed, but some of the way things were set up were nice. Although things got confusing at the end. Like some one was actually going to go somewhere with it, but got lazy.I'm not say to stop your life to watch this movie. But if you're bored, its a nice time filler/late night movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goosebumps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film only appeals to people who are between the ages of 13-17 and mostly appeals to girls, if your watching this and your a 38 year old man, it's pretty clear you won't like it.At times this film gives me goosebumps because of all the moments between Lola (Miley Cyrus) and Her Mum who share a really close relationship. The Group of friends in school contain boys and girls who are mostly paired up in relationships, Typical School life and a heart warming story. A few famous actors who I recognised star in the film which made it all the better. Good acting through-out and a good story line One of my favourite films, don't understand all the bad reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as everyone's saying...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've not seen the original French version that everyone's saying this was supposed to be a (failed) remake of so maybe this is actually a good thing for me? I had no idea this wasn't original, and personally I really enjoyed it :D I'm 16 and a girl so I'm guessing I'd be counted as the target audience, and although this wasn't a very deep film, I enjoyed it as a light and funny film that I could relate to :) I'm not a movie critic so my opinion probably doesn't mean anything, but I didn't see any problem with the acting, the script was okay and the soundtrack was brilliant :D I loved how many songs came up that I know and enjoy :)Anyway, point is that this is a great, fun film for someone my age, although it won't be running for any awards any time soon :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe all the negative reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so badly panned, that I thought it must be the worst movie ever made. Normally, I don't read reviews, but there were so many negative reviews, and I'd never even heard of this movie.I'm a big Miley fan, so I thought, how bad can it be? Also, Demi Moore. And, the movie was great. The acting, the story, the music, cinematography, style... I loved it. The bond between Demi and Miley was so strong, and their on-screen relationship so real, it reminded me completely of my relationship with my teenage daughter. It's love hate. Mostly love, and the love is what matters.Some people were asking for a real review, not just an attack by someone who was a devotee of the original in French. I never saw it. Maybe it was great, but who cares. Miley was GREAT here in a more adult role than Hannah Montana or that she played in her previous roles. She played it great. She's a great actress. So is Demi. They deserve better than this.If you like Miley, if you liked Hannah Montana, if you don't need a blockbuster movie every time but just want to see some good acting on the part of some good actors, real emotions, Marlo Thomas is in it and does a great job, there's humor, and she provides some of it, feel free to see this movie. It's not really a bad movie, and Miley, Demi and Marlo are great in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exaggerated Chick Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of Miley Cyrus but this one is much different and more interesting than any movies she has done before. I think that Miley Cyrus did improve from her other movies such as The Last Song. In this movie she has to play a difficult teenager. I don't think that guys would like this movie. I felt that some parts were to cheesy. The music was good. Demi Moore in this movie is the mum of the difficult teenager Lola (Cyrus) she did an okay job but nothing impressive. To many clichés and not that much of a plot. If you like the 'teen rebel' kind of movie this is probably for you. I would never watch this again. If you have a girls night then this is probably the movie you should rent. As I said before this is not like anything Miley Cyrus has done before so it might shock the viewers of Hannah Montana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good, the bad, and the ugly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's definitely not for everyone, i.e. young Hannah fans and parents with teens might cringe. But, surprisingly, I found this movie heartwarming. Miley delivers a good performance and commentary throughout the movie. Her outrageous friends and relationship with Demi Moore is icing on the cake. I'm sure every has experience with 'the postit' and a parent finding out their dirty secrets. Now for the ugly. This movie tackles a very uncomfortable topic, which needs to be tackled but this movie does it in a slightly flawed way. Kids watching could get some bad ideas to try, like flirting with the teacher and smoking but also teaches them to have a honest relationship with their parents. The plot jumps around slightly too. I can't wait to see what's next in store for Miley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Chick flick. Why all the complaints?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had very low expectations of this movie considering all the reviews I read before watching it, but now, afterward, I am happy to say that I enjoyed it from beginning to end.The story was scripted full of clichés and had quite cheesy lines, which I personally didn't mind considering it being a total chick flick. I am a sucker for these kind of movies and guessing it is for a younger adult/teenage audience, it fit me perfectly. Sure, it's a Hollywood movie, it doesn't mirror real life very well at all, but all those small details in behaviors, issues and thoughts are fun to recognize yourself in as a teenager yourself.The actors were great, I don't know what's up with all the fuzz about Miley, I am not a hardcore fan, but I really enjoyed her performance in The Last song, which was quite a lot a more of a serious movie, but I have no complaints about this one. She plays her roll well and so does the whole cast. It does have a kind of "Mean girls" feeling to it, just not as dramatic and extreme, which I find positive because they become a little bit more real. Realistic for being a Hollywood movie.It fulfilled everything I could think of because I can't find anything bad to say about it. It has love and relationships being reflected from different angles; boyfriend-girlfriend, mother-daughter and friendship. I think there can be something for everyone whether you're a little sister or a grandmother, the only requirement is not expecting a Oscar performance movie, but being open about having a few laughs. Because that's what this movie can bring you.</fullReview>

Demi Moore is cool and her character is not that great as well. i enjoyed the flick and it should be better but its not bad by any means.watch it, have fun the films enjoyable and have fun. don't expect the greatest movie ever this is not a serious movie. nothing clever about it, not much of a plot or anything its like a amusing way to kill time so watch it and have a few laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that is angled towards younger teens. However, it touches on things that many teens experience throughout their life. It does a wonderful job of following Lola while she is attempting to learn how to be her own person.While the acting was a bit interesting at times it really is one of Miley's better movies. Leaps and bounds past The Last Song which was a wonderful movie even though her acting was not.If your expecting a wonderful master minded movie then this is not for your. However if your looking for an easy watch then it's not a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the reviews for LOL and watching the movie, I absolutely loved it! I was hesitant at first before I watched LOL, but I was so glad I made the right choice to watch it. It deals with relationships, love,and problems. It's not like any other movie about love and relationships.The movie itself is awkward, but hilarious!! My friend and I could not stop laughing! I'm not the type of fourteen year old girl who is obsessed with chick flicks, but this movie is amazing! Im not a big fan of Miley Cyrus, but in LOL, she is amazing at her role. So, either buy the movie or rent it. Either hate it or love it. I LOVED IT! This movie inspired me to write in a journal. Hopefully a lot of people will keep a journal with them. This is the type of movie you can watch with your mom, your friend, or just by yourself! This movie will touch your heart and any teenager or adult will adore this movie!! I'm sure you will love it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie, I mainly saw it because I'm a fan of Miley Cyrus so I may sound biased.Cons: -A few cast members bothered me, especially a character in the movie named Chad... if you watch this you'll see why. -It can be a little slow to pick up the "plot" of the movie at times -It wasn't long enoughPros: -I think Miley &amp; Demi are great pair as mom/daughter. -This movie is REALLY relate-able to teenagers -Loved the use of technology in the movie -Loved how this movie showed the life of Miley's character, Lola and her Mom's separate life (Demi Moore).Overall, if you're sitting around contemplating to watch this movie, you won't regret it. I definitely will watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's OK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'm far away from being Miley fan, I just tolerate her, but it doesn't mean that I reject everything she's in. I rather enjoyed Last Song and it's the same case with this movie, it's just not that bad as many people say. There are much worse things around and there is plenty of them. OK, you won't find great acting, storytelling or cinematography here, but overall it's really OK. If you would watch only great movies than you would see them maybe once or twice a year, if you are lucky. I have just watched this one and although it's not great, I don't regret it, I just spent some nice time with it. There is some review that spends a lot of space comparing it with Juno. Dude, you don't compare Orwell, Sallinger, Cortazar or Marquez with Larsson, Rowling or Grisham - they are in completely different leagues, but it doesn't mean that you can't enjoy all of them, just different ways. Don't let the negative reviews put you off from it or you might loose something you would really enjoy, even more than I. I gave it 10/10 in my humble attempt to make it's rating a little better, but it really deserves 6/10 right there in the middle (no 0 on IMDb so 5 would be below), because for me, it's exactly where it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same awesome French movie, just more glamorous, less real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed original French version after viewing American version. Same awesome movie. American version is entirely the same movie, just more glamorous and more up-to-American-environment. I don't know if US teenagers are really more glamorous than European, but that makes a slight difference between movies, actually. European version seems more real, while American gives you a hatch to the glamorous life. So every version is better than the other in some way. I guess all the weed is still from European culture, they just didn't want to change the working movie. Or, maybe, I just don't have too many American weed smoking friends, so I underestimate that.So why this huge gap in rating between the two versions? American trolls of Miley Cyrus, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is probably the best teen movie ever made. I've watched French version before and I prefer this one. Demi Moore did such a great job as Anne and Miley, perfect. I couldn't get over noticing how people wrote bad reviews for it before even release date (all of them were posted on the exact same date, so probably one person with more accounts) and I find this stupid. If they'd watch the movie, they'd love it. But, back to the movie. It can relate to every teen. I only watched a few clips of the original (French) one before, but I find this one better. The movie sadly won't win any Oscar or anything, because Lionsgate screwed it. The fact that they lost faith in such a good movie makes me sick. They should definitely promote it more, release it worldwide or something and NOT releasing it after 2 years. Anyway, I'm glad I waited for the DVD. I've watched it about 6 times since yesterday, when it arrived. There's a lot of texting in the movie which is great, between Anne and Lola when they text each other " (((( HUG )))) ?" for about three or four times in the movie. You never know what's gonna happen next. 1 hour and a half of the movie went so fast! You should definitely consider watching it and giving it a chance, you won't regret it! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just because you don't like Miley...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...doesn't mean you instantly have to rate the movie bad. Some people have been giving it bad reviews just because of Miley being in the movie and they haven't even seen it yet.A lot of people have said that they enjoyed the movie, and Miley's acting. Half of these people didn't even like Miley, so she could not have been as bad as you are all making her out to be. Even from the trailer, you can see that her acting isn't bad. It's actually pretty good. And if you moved on from disliking her because of things she's done in her personal life (which doesn't affect her acting at all), you would probably enjoy the movie a lot more than you did.The movie is a coming of age film which shows the young generation and the relationship between mother and daughter. If you're lucky enough to be able to see it in one of the very few cinemas it's showing in, please do. The movie is on a VERY limited release and we want it to get expanded so that more of Miley's fans have a chance to see it. Not even just Miley's fans - there's Demi Moore, Ashley Greene, Douglas Booth and more. I'm positive that if you go and watch the movie and give it a chance (without judging Miley for "bad" things she's done in her PERSONAL life) you will actually enjoy it.</fullReview>

(Even the extra's where excellent)Excellent Story/Plot.Good Stuntwork.And it has much genres, who are handled very well in this movie: Action/Comedy/Romance/Drama/Adventure/Thriller (not really, but a kind of Thriller)/Musical/Film Noir. Each word of this movie is excellent. I think it has the greatest story ever! I was hurted when i came to know that Mrs. Lisa Azuelos is remaking this classic... Despite becoming the most successful film of its time, it failed to win any major popular or critics awards. The lone Filmfare award it got went to M.S.

I have a petition of 354 people that say LOL should be played nation wide in the USA not just in 7 theatres. It is rather dumb on Liongates part because of the HUGE budget and they aren't putting it out there to get any of the $ back. They should at least give it a try for a week or something.

Miley did a very could job, not for once did I feel like I was watching 'Hannah Montana' (I used to watch it regularly). She became Lola. And Demi was perfect. And I'm so happy they decided to make India the place for the world premiere. very few movies do that. But anyway loved it and hope you people do too, when you get to see it.
