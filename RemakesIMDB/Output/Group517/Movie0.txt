		<shortDescription>It ain't mine, and I'm pretty sure you don't want it to be yours.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'd rather be watching a funeral." That quote, stated by Stephanie after watching Dennis Quaid get hit in the head for about the 18th time, serves as a strong indictment of this most unnecessary of remakes, but sadly it's one of the nicest things one can say about the film.Easily one of the 10 worst movies of the year, Yours, Mine, and Ours should be more aptly titled Suck, Suck, and Suck. Is there still a market for movies that feature little more than a bunch of young kids eating tons of sweets, splattering a house with paint, and hating each other? I figured such uncreative antics had run their course, but perhaps I was wrong. Or perhaps the people involved with this production simply had no better ideas."Were the writers even trying?" Stephanie asked me as Dennis Quaid got splattered with paint, fell in a pool of goo, and then tripped over a flatulent pig that, of course, eats at the family dinner table. "No, they weren't," I replied as I stared dumbfounded at the screen, shaking my head over the fact that the writers expect us to laugh about kids vomiting and then falling in it.I suppose I should commend the movie for warning the audience right away just how bad a time they can expect to have if they attempt to sit through the full 90 minutes. If the "Nickelodeon Films" moniker fails to send up any red flags, then the fact that Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo (possibly the hottest 51-year-old woman on the planet) meet, rekindle their high school relationship, get engaged, get married, and buy a brand new house all within the first 10 minutes should seal the deal that it's in your best interest to sprint to the exit and ask for your money back.There are two legitimately funny scenes in the movie, one involving Dennis Quaid brushing his tongue. Everything else has been done several times with equally unfunny results. "Oh look, Dennis Quaid's son has accidentally started up a forklift at the store! Oh look, Dennis Quaid just jumped on the forklift and his head is bumping against every box in the store! Oh look, Dennis Quaid's credibility can actually be seen leaking out of the screen!" That's what's considered funny these days?And just when you think things can't get any worse, the writers decide to blindside us with an ending so ridiculously sappy that you'll be wishing you brought your trusty yellow bucket and you'll pray for an end to your dry heaving. I officially hate lighthouses now.I suppose 10-year-old girls might enjoy this, but if you value your time or money then I recommend that you stay away. Far away. This is a movie so the opposite of hilarious that I'm forced to come up with a new word for it - lolarious (pronounced "low-larious"). Feel free to use the word amongst friends. Hopefully its popularity will spread and it will one day be added to the dictionary. At least then I could say one good thing came out of the film.As it stands, Yours, Mine, and Ours ain't mine, I'm pretty sure you don't want it to be yours, and if we made it ours then we'd only end up arguing over who would be the one to get rid of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Admiral Frank Beardsley returns to his hometown after years of Coast Guard service, he meets his old flame Helen North at a high school reunion. Both recently widowed, the two find the old sparks again immediately and marry on a whim. There's one catch. Frank has eight children and Helen has ten children (many adopted).Someone should tell the writers of Yours, Mine and Ours that chaos does not equal funny. Two parents, eighteen kids, one crazy nanny and one pig all live under the same house, so hilarity is supposed to ensue right? Well, not in this film. All of the laughs are few and far in between and when the movie is over, all you're left with is one big headache. Kids will most likely eat this one up but they deserve better films than this. It's no surprise that this film is a dud since its directed by Raja Gosnell. He is your typical bland director and he doesn't have much imagination. He always puts the lamest jokes and pratfalls into his films like Dennis Quaid falling face first into a bucket of paint.Dennis Quaid plays the uptight father and he pretty much makes a fool of himself here. He seems to be trying so hard to get a laugh from the audience but he fails. I'm surprised he took this role since this is a little out of his usual element but I guess Tim Allen was busy. Rene Russo plays his wife and she was okay but a little bland. After this film and Two for the Money, she needs a new agent because she actually is talented. There were so many kids that it was hard to keep track of them. Most of them were either bland or they played annoying characters. There were a few that showed a little potential for the future but I wouldn't hold my breath. In the end, a weak story, very few laughs, weak acting and bad direction equals a poor film and this movie is better left on the shelf. Rent the original instead. Rating 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Family Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Beardsley (Quaid) is a 2-Star Admiral in the USCG and a widower with 8-kids. Helen North (Russo) is a dress designer and a widow with 10-kids. They were sweethearts in High School and meet 30-years later and get married. The kids don't like it and plan to break up this union.Let's see, we had the "Little Old Woman Who Iived in a Shoe etc; then we had Our Gang Comedies; Then the Brady Bunch; then Eight is Enough, and then My Three Sons. All had something going for them. All were good in their day and I predict that this movie will soon be a family TV show.Yes, there are silly things in here. Come on, there are 18-kids involved so you can expect some of that. Frank runs a tight ship, and Helen does not. One of Helen's kids says, "they get married and we get drafted." See where we are going with this?But, there are also enough funny things going on to keep you going to the end of the movie. Quaid and Russo play it straight and that is to their credit. Rip Torn is always good and is probably one of the most under-rated actors of our time. Jerry O'Connell did okay. I am surprised at the number of times I laughed at some goings on. This is good family fun. There was good timing by all and nothing was overdone and these are quite possibly the reasons the laughs came easily. This is a well done comedy. Yes, I can see where this will become a TV show in time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor remake of a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed with this remake. The original was funny, but this movie was in my opinion, chaotic! I think those kids really needed a trip to the woodshed! In our politically correct system we are made to think that every family is dysfunctional. Most parents would be ashamed of such rowdy children. Why do we put up with such poor family movies? Let's get back to traditional family values. I took my 7 yr old granddaughter to see it and she was appalled by the lack of discipline. Bring back It's a wonderful life and Spensers Mountain. They had real values. Why so many remakes of good films and making them trash? Let's get back to the real America!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not like the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "re-casting" of the family favorite of Yours, Mine, and Ours can't even shake a stick at the original with Fonda and Ball. Granted while the original was contemporary for the day that it was made the dialog, and the family situations dealing with a large family are either ad voided or watered down to a point of non-existence. Koodos for Quaid for his role of the bewildered father. Quaid tries to make the role work with the weak script that he got, but for what he got he did an outstanding job. The 2005 "re-casting" of the situations was nothing more than politically correct mumbo jumbo that missed the mark of the comedic timing. All of it was turned into a slapstick dribble with obvious setups from the production team. They took a great crafted movie and watered it down to a dribble that only family with young kids will like. Yes, the original is dated, but we can still connect with the themes and the characters while the 2005 VERSION OF YOURS, MINE, AND OURS WILL BE LONG Forgotten WHILE THE ORIGINAL REMAINS FRESH.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie/Suitable for kids.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was excellent, it one of very few family movies that are suitable for all ages. Many people say they didn't like it, and gave it bad ratings probably because, there's no sexual humor or sex scenes. These days, If there's sex in a movie, then that makes it interesting and good. Hardly anyone understands that family movies are for families, they're not meant to be nasty to watch, it should be enjoyable for everyone. Movies can be great without that garbage. The humor was good and you can really feel the compassion in this movie. Its great for kids. I loved the way things happened, like the physical humor and the kid actors/actresses were so adorable. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fight over a boy that the two older girls had. I think it was stupid and unnecessary. Drake Bell did a really good job on his part. He was witty and full of drama with the different situations throughout the movie. Everyone did a great job. I give it a 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not mine!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both Russo and Quaid have an energy between them, but they cannot redeem this film, with a paltry script and too many characters, so that the supporting cast remain that, and wasted! The film seems to work on the premise that bigger is always better, and the direction seems to go that way too. What could have benefited from some quieter, uncluttered subtlety, becomes an assault on one's senses, patience and believability.This film could have been better had it been downscaled a bit, and had some honest attempt been made to show plausible character development. Although just released (in SA), it has a jaded feel about it.This comedy might well be yours but it's not mine!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fair Family Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yours, Mine, and Ours and is fair, unoffensive movie that the whole family could enjoy. It's not the best family movie in the world but its passable because of the charm given off from the two lead actors.This is about two high school sweethearts who reunite thirty years later and get married on the spot. But both people have a large number of children and those children combine forces so they can break up Frank and Helen.The acting is okay. The leads are pretty much what carried this movie. Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo are great actors. I wish that the children had more screen time. I could barely tell them apart.The film should have been paced better. It seems like thirty minutes in, we are already near then end. A better screenplay would have also helped this movie.Overall, this is a fair but not great family film. Kids will certainly enjoy it but adults should stay clear from this film. I rate this film 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Yours, Mine and Ours was a terrible movie and a waste of my time to watch. The reasons are quite simple, the actors sucked and the plot was the stupidest.The children supposedly don't like each other and have nothing in common. And instead of trying to explain to their parents that they can't stand each other, have nothing in common and were unfairly forced together without their say, they make a plan to try to break up their parents. Obviosly the kids have no respect toward their parents and their feelings, even the older ones. So what ends up happening is they begin ruining their parents life.What I find the stupidest part of the movie, and what really made it a waste of my time is that these kids supposedly don't like each other. Well it takes a lot of teamwork to pull of the tricks that they were pulling on their parents. They learned to respect each other and eventually even like each other, and yet they were still trying to break their parents apart? The whole reason they wanted to part their parents is because they couldn't stand each other. So why didn't they stop their plan when they began to get along each other? Stupid plot, stupid movie.The pig was a stupid addition, these guys would not had made this movie without their stupid goals behind it. They said "hey lets remake the 1968 movie Yours, Mine and Ours so we can out-number the kids in cheaper by the dozen". And then said "hey lets add a pot-bellied pig so we can have an original family pet just like in The Pacifier". Also the fact the Quaid was married to another dress designer like in The Parent Trap. They take the wreckless slapstick style with no humor in it. This movie is a rip off of so many things and lacks the ability to make me laugh.And another stupid thing about this movie is the character Helen North. She has disciplinophobia(Not a real word as far as I know). She is scared of discipline, total hippie. There is Nothing I hate more than somebody, whether they are real or a character, who is afraid to put their foot down. After the kids trash that store I thought their would be heavy consequences. After they throw that party without their parents permission, behind their back, when their home is full of complete strangers trashing their house and when the kids are neglected, stored away and sick on junk food she tells Frank to relax?! I would expect any health parent to ship their kids off to military school after a stunt like that(only the kids that threw the party). She is in a relaxing mood at a time like this? Pathetic, and worse than that she was afraid to set any rules or boundaries. When Frank says "There is nothing wrong with having rules. Everybody lives by them, the entire universe lives by them." She says "Well then Frank that's the last thing these kids need from me. There's only one rule I know, and that's at any time all of this can be over. Taken away from you forever, then who needs more rules after that.". Sounds a lot like a divorce threat to me. Why would any parent(especially a parent of ten) want no rules or boundaries for their kids? Unrealisticly a terrible character, it pisses me off so much I want to take my fist and..........I found nothing good about this movie, except its alright for anybody 9 and under. I would have voted 0 but I can't.Also I feel sorry for all of you so naive to actually enjoy this movie. God remove the devil inside you for it.Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A family of 20, and yet not one of them is funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing against Dennis Quaid or Rene Russo, but they certainly were in way over their heads, not because they had to contend with 18 snotty brats, but rather because of this tedious and contrived script adaptation that strangles a once amusing story.First of all, the romance is implausible. A stern Coast Guard admiral who regiments his ten offspring like so many deck swabbies meets a free-spirit who lets her eight kids run wild, and these polar opposites fall instantly in love? Then, like two infatuated teenagers, they impulsively run off and elope faster than you can say, "Vegas wedding with Elvis, please." After this, the movie just disintegrates into a parade of scenes of this mob of kids yelling, crying, fighting, breaking things, or something always falling on the dad. No comedy; just tired, overused old jokes, and monotonously boring. The plot is built upon these hateful creeps plotting to destroy their parents' marriage and happiness. Funny? No, it's not. Typical of this inept movie is the routine ending which doesn't even fit the action that precedes it. For those who can't wait to see the obligatory scene of a little kid puking, don't worry; it's here too. After watching this, you may do the same.Just plain irritating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh, like we need another of these?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been done. Over and over and over and over. Parents do something (move, get married, get divorced, etc.) kids don't like, kids get mad and act like spoiled little brats to try and get parents to rethink the decision.That's about what this is. Now, there's 18 kids between the two stars. You'd think that in 18 kids, ranging from toddlers to teens, that one, at least ONE of them, would poke their heads out of their own little universe, and think "Hey, our parents seem happy. I may not like it, but I'll give it a shot." You'd think that at least one of them wouldn't be selfish, would you? But no! Every single one of the little terrors (and I'm 17, so don't think I only call them that as some sort of kid-hating adult) hates moving and hates the new family. So they put aside their differences and work together to split their parents up and get things back the way they were. And naturally, the parents don't suspect a thing when the kids start going to extremes.And of course, things work out. And kids realize they've made a mistake. They go too far and feel bad (Mom cried herself to sleep). I don't understand that part. You feel bad kids? Really? My god, who ever could have thought that acting like brats and ruining every aspect of your parents' lives would be a bad idea? Really, I figured that pushing every button you know of till they snap would be a good idea.And the ending is just so corny. My Beautiful Lighthouse Keeper? Give me a break here. Now that I've trashed the kids, let's move on to the parents. An artist/hippie/whatever, marries a super-strict naval officer. Am I the only one who thinks there may be eventual conflicts of interests here? And trying to rekindle a kigh-school romance decades later...always a bright idea!Very few genuine laughs. The pig...why does the family own a pig? The housekeeper...not needed, she's actually scary. When you get to the core bone of the movie...there isn't much there. The plot is as thin as the humor. If you must see a movie where a bunch of selfish kids try and work over their parents due to a petty thing like moving, go see Cheaper by the Dozen. Steve Martin is actually funny, unlike Dennis Quaid. Honestly, there was only one entire scene in the whole movie that got a real laugh out of me, at the party scene:Who here lives here (kids raise hands). Anyone else still here within 5 minutes will be forcably consctripted into the United States Coastguard!There. You now know the one funny thing in the whole movie. Now, save yourself 2 hours and however many dollars it would cost to rent this, and don't,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable But Predictable: A Remake And Echoes Of Cheaper By The Dozen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yours, Mine And Ours (2005) Starring Dennis Quaid, Rene Russo, Sean Faris, Katia Pevec, Dean Collins, Tyler Patrick Jones, Brecken Palmer, Haley Ramm, Ty Panitz, Danielle Panabaker, Drake Bell, Directed by Raja Gosnell.This comedy film is actually a remake the late 60's film of the same name which starred none other than Luclle Ball. Dennis Quaid is Admiral Beardsley, a divorced father with several kids and who runs his household as if it were a highly disciplined navy ship. Rene Russo is Helen North, a free spirit, Neo-Hippie purse designer with several children of her own, many of them clearly adopted. Before you can say "Brady Bunch" rip-off, this film is actually suited to present day audiences. There are a lot of hilarious moments which are sure to have kids rolling in the aisles with laughter and moments adults can appeciate as well. The children are the true stars, as there are so many of them (how much did they get paid for this ?). They each act their roles with comedic flair and it's enjoyable to watch them feud as all siblings do and eventually scheme to break up their parents. Dennis Quaid is out of his element in a comic film, and it's obvious he is trying too hard. Also, I've noted many similarities between this film and "Cheaper By The Dozen" which has basically the same "Brady Bunch" premise. Tim Allen would have been a better Admiral Beardsley but in truth, he was busy working on "The Shaggy Dog". Quaid does a fine job but it's just uncomfortable for me to see him in this film. It's evident he is trying to imitate Steve Martin's character in Cheaper By The Dozen. Rene Russo is a fine Helen North and plays her part well but she's dull and unintersting and of courses cannot live up to the actress who originated the role - Lucille Ball herself. Overall, this film is funny but it's predictable.</fullReview>

The acting was above average, the comedy was above average...and sure it was like watch another "Brady-Bunch" movie, but this one has a few of it's own twist. It was from the "Nic" studio, so right there tells you it's more targeted to kids. But as a 30-somthing, I must admit, I enjoyed it thoroughly. I would (and have) recommended it to my family and friends and will continue to do so. Give it a chance...it's a cute movie.

		<shortDescription>Cheaper by TWO DOZEN!! Predictable but no so bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yours, Mine and Ours has some fatal flaws that for most (especially critics) destroyed the film (although it's made more than it's fair share of profit.) The film is brutally predictable and not only that but is far from a new concept coming along on the heels and in front of the Cheaper By The Dozen series. The single only difference is double the children. Unfortunately as cute as that sounds there is just too many cast members. There are so many children that only a small few of them ever get to show off their characters. The film still aims for the exact same comedy as Cheaper By The Dozen did...physical comedy usually involving the fact that so many children are under the same roof. The only plot variation is that these kids are trying to break up their new found parents because they hate each other.Dennis Quaid is by the book Navy Admiral Frank Beardsley. Quaid is always a terrific leading man and he can do action, drama, and also comedy including some very funny physical comedy and pulls it off flawlessly. He is in fact one of the highlights of this film and certainly brings the most ability to the cast. Rene Russo is free spirited and less regimented new wife Helen North who brings her 10 kids (6 adopted, 4 of her own) to the chaos. Russo is a good actress with a lot of experience and she nails a lot of big roles opposite basically every leading man in Hollywood but doesn't necessarily make her great. Her acting is a bit dry and over performed in this film. She borders on annoying and if I were Quaid I would have ran for the hills...High School sweetheart or not. The kids...well the kids do well but there is so darn many of them that none of them ever get the opportunity to really stand out with perhaps the exception of Sean Faris who plays eldest son William who plays a strong character but looks too old to be doing the things he gets involved with and the young twins Brecken and Bridger Palmer who are adorable and the perfect trouble makers. Again all the kids do a fine job but there is way too many parts to make any difference.The film beginning to end is complete chaos with a hint of a decent storyline but everything moves at such break neck speed. Quaid and Russo meet and marry in about thirty seconds and how much money would these guys actually need to support a family of TWENTY?? Plus housekeeper, pig, dog, hamster etc. Russo and Quaid do have decent chemistry and Quaid's character is a good character and a good father and some of the cute moments are exactly that...cute...but not overly funny. Little kids will probably like the chaotic kids running wild fun but for most adults it'll get old quick. I will say as predictable and clearly mapped out as the film is the ending is still warm and fuzzy and will make you smile...any good feel good family flick should do that. It's not something you should avoid, it's not as bad as critics say it is but it's mostly just a cute little family flick. 7/10</fullReview>

While on a date, he runs into his childhood sweetheart artist Helen White-North (Rene Russo) who has 10 children and on a date of her own. She's also a widower and adopted 6 of her kids. They reconnect, quickly marries and move into the big lighthouse from their past. Frank brings along his housekeeper Mrs. Munion (Linda Hunt). The kids don't get along and decide to join forces to split up the couple.There are just so many kids. There are so many of them that most remain nameless unknown figures to me. The two oldest girls have a good side story but that's rare. The older kids have some more things to do but the kids become a blob mass. I like the general outline of the movie. It doesn't have much comedy that works but the story is a little heart warming. That is until the last act when I lose all interest in the movie. The whole movie is so predictable on auto pilot and I didn't care so much about the individual characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's be honest here: there are films which are pretty much an art form such as "Seven Samurai" or "The Grand Illusion" and then there are "just movies": action movies, comedies, sci-fi, recent slew of comic strip/toy movies (least favorite to me) and one badly underrepresented category, which incidentally makes the most money in Hollywood (they did not get the memo though): family movies. Notice I did not call them "films", although to be able to entertain the whole family without blood, gore, sex, violence, war, darkness and such, is quite an achievement today worthy of the name "film".Family movies are meant to entertain the whole family but in an entirely positive, relaxed and children safe way. This film achieved all of those, while many family favorites, we have to admit, do have scenes that make us cringe and are not really appropriate for children (E.g. Indiana Jones series).Within that domain of family entertainment, "Yours, Mine and Ours" is one fine movie. Making a film with 20 kids is bordering with madness - the old adage of Hollywood is "No animals, no children." Making it funny and interesting to watch without resorting to cheap thrills of fast car rides, sex scenes/nudity, guns or simply shallow behavior is commendable. They managed to pull it off with no less than 20 children and a few pets to boot. That in itself deserves praise.The film is a romantic comedy wrapped around tons of kids doing their shenanigans, a new house, pets, and so on. Again, if you are aware that this is a family film, and lower your guard, rather then expect 20 kids to earn Oscars, you will enjoy it.Both Rene Russo and Dennis Quaid were excellent, and truly funny. The kids were funny too (and older ones obviously acted better than their younger "siblings" which is to be expected given the age difference).If you have a child, and would like to have a film to watch, than this would be the one. Children laugh through the entire film, and there is still more than enough for adults to enjoy.For being a daring, well executed and thoroughly enjoyable family fun, I give it 10 stars. Let's hope we get to see more of similar movies in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming But Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dennis Quaid is a Coast Guard Commander with eight kids raised with rules and schedules. Rene Russo has four kids and six adopted kids with no rules and a freethinking lifestyle. Faster than you can say "Brady Bunch," these two former loves take a hunch and decide to merge their families. The resulting movie is pretty much as expected, a lot of fighting, arguing and expected destruction. This movie is much more than an update to the Henry Fonda/Lucille Ball; like "The Parent Trap" before it, it's both a reboot and update, something that doesn't always work, but there's also a nice love story behind the kids conspiring to break up their parents marriage and as a result, bond over their duplicitous action. It's quite predictable, but the end result is still worth a look-see. After all, even if you know where you're going, you still want to see the trip that gets there. The only drawback to the movie is that there is not a recognizable face among the kids except for Danielle Panabaker (CSI, Phil Of The Future?) and comedian David Koeschner (Hannah Montana) who appears an acquaintance of the father. It's a small nitpick, but its not enough to bar anyone from renting this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked Cheaper By the Dozen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to Roger Ebert's 2005 review, he thought a lot of the movie was contrived. I disagree. Yes, it's predictable, but that is a given in this kind of family movie. For a while, I thought this was not going to be anything special, but all the expected things that could, and do, happen, make this entertaining. Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo are no Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, but they do have chemistry, which Ebert thought they didn't have. This is basically the same movie as Cheaper by the Dozen, so what in the world was he (and most critics) expecting? If you are looking for another of that movie, you won't be disappointed. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chaotic story about bringing two large families together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie for a family nigh in, it has great actors and a funny story. Although I couldn't help thinking that everything was made out to be much more chaotic than it had to be (for instance the paint fight). Otherwise this movie was very entertaining.This movie is about a widow and a widower who have a big flock of children each. When these two meet again at a class reunion they fall in love and decide to get married and this creates a great conflict because the two large families must merge together to become one even larger family.I love Dennis Quaid and this was a great performance from his side.</fullReview>

They all of a sudden got it back out and now they watch it at least once a week. They laugh and laugh! I liked the original of course, I'm a big Lucy fan, but for the modern world...this one works for my kids, they are the toughest critics! They really liked the crazy family the North kids. We are a military family so it was humorous to see the military Beardsley kids with their dad. The best parts....the middle, with all the schemes to break up the parents. The worst part...the part where she is crying in her room at the beginning of the movie....kids didn't get that part. oh! Is there really an old lighthouse just sitting around vacant, waiting for a big family to move in? oh well....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film funny and a good time. There were a couple points that I thought weren't really suited to this leading man (Quaid), but other than that, the acting was great.I could feel chemistry between 'Mom &amp; Dad' and also the tension between them. The kids also did a great job making the tension real as well as the affection they later have for each other (which we all knew was going to happen, but I'm not bothered by this sort of predictability as most films have many predictable moments and the ones that strive too hard to avoid it usually end up unsatisfying).Although I can't imagine a situation like theirs ever being successful in real life (two large, but vastly different families coming together), this film does very well in making you forget that just for a while.It's a clean film suitable for anybody. The charm, the characters, the story, the chemistry, the hijinks; all worthwhile reasons to watch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It wasn't too bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my sis to see it last week and we didn't mind it. Though in parts pretty predictable, it was perfectly enjoyable to watch, the acting was pretty good in most parts although there seemed to be no real electricity between Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo. The performances by the four eldest (Sean Faris, Katija Pevec, Drake Bell and Danielle Panabaker.) Were very good. Though I think the best was by newcomer Nicholas Roget-King who really caught the emotion in sad scenes and the comedy in the funny scenes. Mostly the other children had to smaller parts to really comment. The only real thing I noticed was how many times I found myself looking out for the jokes which were also displayed in CBTD and there seemed to be quite a few. This movie though not one I'd really like to see again, was perfectly acceptable for children, though I'd like to see a wider range personality next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far Funnier than You May Imagine for PG rated Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Hollywood remakes an old movie, they usually have to spice up the plot to accommodate contemporary audiences. The remake of the Lucille Ball &amp; Henry Fonda family comedy "Yours, Mine, &amp; Ours" toplining Rene Russo &amp; Dennis Quaid eliminates scenes that today's audiences might find offensive. Indeed, the Motion Picture Association of America would have changed the remake's family friendly PG rating to a mature-oriented PG-13 had those scenes been duplicated. The 37 years between the original and its riotous rehash reveals much about what a G rating meant in 1968 and the PG rating that the MPAA gave the 2005 remake. For example, in the first "Yours, Mine, &amp; Ours," the widower's three teenage sons concocted an alcoholic beverage for the Lucille Ball character that consisted of equal parts of gin, scotch, and vodka, and she gets deliriously drunk at dinner. Nowadays, movies that depict this kind of aberrant behavior garner an R-rating. Today's R-rated epics generate considerably less revenue than either PG-13 or PG films. In a politically correct climate that doesn't tolerate showing teens mixing up alcoholic drinks, Hollywood toes a tightrope. Meanwhile, the two "Yours, Mine, &amp; Ours" movies differ fundamentally in other respects, too. Whereas the Ball/Fonda film rambled along at a leisurely 111 minutes, with a largely amiable but straightforward plot, the Russo/Quaid remake clocks in at 88 minutes with a far more farcical plot. Anybody who remembers the mild-mannered 1968 version should find the remake a vast improvement. Actually, the slapstick shenanigans in the remake resemble the typical tomfoolery that Lucille Ball specialized in on her landmark "I Love Lucy" (1951-1957) CBS sitcom.Far-fetched as this harmless hokum clearly is, "Yours, Mine, &amp; Ours" owes its origins to Helen Beardsley's autobiographical bestseller "Who Gets the Drumsticks" published in 1964. In real-life, the widower and widow of two families consisting of 8 and 10 children respectively tied the knot and enjoyed special privileges at the U.S. Navy's commissary. Screen writing duo Ron Burch and David Kidd, who penned the Freddie Prinze, Jr. comedy "Head over Heels," have exaggerated the comedic elements and set apart both families by creating opposing lifestyles. The families in the previous "Yours, Mine, &amp; Ours" appeared virtually identical compared with those in the remake. U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Frank Beardsley (Dennis Quaid of "The Alamo") runs a taut ship for his eight children of all ages. They've grown accustomed to the dysfunctional lifestyle of being transferred frequently from one military installation to another. When the Coast Guard relocates this middle-aged widower from San Diego to his hometown of New London, Connecticut, to serve as commandant of the Coast Guard Academy, he runs into his old flame, Helen North (Rene Russo of "Lethal Weapon 4"), a widow herself with ten offspring of all ages, at their 30th annual high school reunion aboard a cruise ship. Presto, Frank and Helen rekindle the chemistry that attracted them initially and make for the altar without inviting their kids in the wedding. The Beardsleys buy a dilapidated warehouse-sized domicile near the coast with a lighthouse and settle down to the humongous task of renovating it with every predictable but side-splitting pratfall known to slapstick comedy. Nevertheless, the love that Frank and Helen share doesn't compensate for the drastic differences in their child rearing practices. Frank's kids mind him, address him as "sir", and utter no complaints about the regimen that he has established for their daily chores and their morning bathroom logistics. However, Helen's free-spirited brood, four of whom form an adopted Rainbow Coalition of sorts in racial heritage, balk at Frank's rules and regulations. Basically, the children hate each other and fight among themselves, until they realize that the only way they can get back to normal is to break up their parents."Scooby Doo" director Raja Gosnell keeps things snappy, so that the story doesn't sink in its own sap. While the original plodded along for nearly 50 minutes before the principals exchanged vows, Quaid and Russo get married off-screen in the first 15 minutes. Gosnell never misses a chance to stage elaborate pranks with leading man Dennis Quaid. Quaid falls face down into a pool of paint during a madcap Home Depot shopping spree. The chief scene stealer is a personable pot-bellied pig that belongs to Helen's hippie-style kids. The pig takes a bath in the kitchen sink, dines at the breakfast table, and awakens the admiral with wet piggy kisses in the A.M. Sure, "Yours, Mine, &amp; Ours" stoops a lot and qualifies as more predictable than surprising, but the sympathetic performances by Quaid and Russo keep this comedy afloat rather than scuttle it. Altogether , "Yours, Mine, &amp; Ours" refuses to take itself as seriously as the original and ranks as far funnier than you may imagine for PG rated comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yours mine and ours is the best movie. It's about a man who is a coast guard and runs his family like his job where they are all organised in their home remedies. The man is a widower and he raises eight kids all by himself. A few streets away is where a woman lives.The woman has an artsy personality.The woman lives in a big pink house.The woman is a widow and she raises ten kids because she adopted six and four is her's. Her kids get her artsy personality in them and they are sort of like a hippie family. The woman goes out to dinner with her worker friend but at the same time the same man who is a widower who was her old high school sweetheart is there on a blind date so they meet at the same restaurant.The woman's family owns a pig and the pig is treated like a member of the family that's funny. The woman and man met up again at their high school Reunion on a cruise ship.Then they say how many kids they have then they joke at the amount they have.Then the same night the man asks the woman to marry him despite the kids wishes. The kids met and they hate each other and they have nothing in common.The two families team together to break up their mum and dad.It works but they hate the outcome.The dad leaves for a job on a cruise ship around the world and the mum was going to move back to her house.So the kids team together to get their mum and dad back and then they are all happy. I really loved this movie and I hope you do to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda must be turning in their graves.Dennis Quaid is a great actor who has done some great movies. This isn't one of them. It's an unnecessary remake filled with overused, humorless gags. Single parents meet, get married, their kids hate each other, they mess up the house, turn on the parents, and bond in the process. Why not just watch the original, or at least a few episodes of the Brady Bunch? Both were much better shows than this one.Why the writers bothered putting in the racially diverse foster kids angle, I don't know. It doesn't enter into any aspect of the story. Thankfully, these writers don't try to explore it; it would probably be just as superficial and contrived as the rest of the movie.This is not the worst film I've seen, but it's a dud. I gave it some minimal credit for good acting and decent camera work. My recommendation: Rent the original and have some classic laughs. Leave this one in the $1.99 bin at WalMart.</fullReview>

The movie showed me comedy, romance, but most of all, teamwork. Yes, you read that sentence correctly. Teamwork. At the beginning of the movie, your going to wonder what the heck I'm talking about. But then, throughout the last half, your going to notice how the two sides of the family put their differences together, hilariously trying to rip their parents relationship into shreds.Like I said, this movie was great, and I'm sure that if you watch it you'll agree with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Source for Background Noise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first version stayed true to Helen North Beardsely's story. As a movie, it was an endearing pairing of two Hollywood luminaries who had great material to work with. It brought into the forefront trivial issues as how groceries for such a huge household were made, and how sometimes carrying your father's last name could sometimes be viewed as unacceptable by nitpickers. Not a technical marvel, it was a cool breeze of a film.This second -- and hopefully, last -- version of YOURS, MINE, AND OURS attempts to bring a kiddie sensibility into the works, which means, the kids will now have a lot more to do, even to a point that they drive the entire, colorless plot which is but a passing shadow of the original. The director never takes time to establish anything other than a wham-bam-thank you ma'am introduction to Helen and Frank Beardsley's courtship and even adds a new one: that they were high-school but did not hook up. Does it add any new layers to the story? Well, for that matter, have any cows jumped over the Moon lately? Okay, okay. Maybe I'm being a little too cynical. But come on, even a loose remake, a re-working, re-imagining -- whatever you will -- should have something the viewer could hold onto. There is nothing here: no sense of the visual, framing, introduction, conclusion, light or shadow. Rene Russo and Dennis Quaid -- God help them -- can't bring what Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda (both about ten years older and looking it) did in the first. The roles should have been for actors who could bring the balance of zaniness and befuddled control: maybe Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin? (It's only too bad that he was already in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN.) Anyone but these two, even though they both look great, especially Quaid. I noticed.Another example of what tampering with a product that was fine as it was and updating it for today's superficial sensibilities can do. This is something for a Saturday morning with the kids while the coffee brews itself , or as background noise while you do your work and the kids are at home after school. Instant coffee, instant movie, forgettable in an instant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nevada Desert More Interesting to the Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We took a portable DVD player on a 4,000 mile trip. We limited the kids to one, maybe two movies a day. This movie was given to us by some people we made friends with in Idaho so our kids would "have something new to watch." I had never heard my kids complain about a movie before. They kept saying things like:"All the guy does is talk," "Nothing is happening, he is just talking," and so on. I thought maybe the DVD must have been stuck. They turned it off about 20 minutes into the movie. Then they argued who the one was who "picked" it because they took turns picking movies and both wanted to pick the next one. They were happy to just look out the window at the Nevada Desert for a while to unclutter their brains after watching this garbage. Not even worth $1.00 at a yard sale and certainly don't rent it. Maybe I should wonder if our new friends in Idaho are really our friends if they gave us this DVD to watch. Friends don't give friends "Yours, Mine and Ours" to watch, just as friends should not let friends drive drunk. Really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These Ratings Need Negative Numbers for Movies like This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so bad that the only recommendation they could find for the DVD cover was "The best family comedy of the year!" from the (I think nonexistent) Film Advisory Board.The original (with Lucille Ball, Henry Fonda, and Van Johnson) was on Turner Classic Movies recently. While not a classic or a work of art, it was solidly made and from what I remember told the story of this blended family in a fairly accurate manner.The remake has so little to do with the original that it could have been written with different character names and probably nobody would have remembered. At the very least, they should have had the decency to credit as "inspired by" rather than "based upon" the original screenplay. At least they had the decency not to mention Helen Beardsley's book (it's probably out of print, anyway) on the poster.The first mystery about it is how four producing entities (Paramount, Nickelodeon Films, MGM and Columbia) could blow $45 MILLION on a movie that looks so cheap. Where in the world did that money go? No flying saucers, no earthquakes, no aliens. Some $40 plus million either went into somebody's pockets or up somebody's nose. It sure didn't show on screen.And whose idea was it to get all those "politically correct" adopted and foster children in there? I guess this was a ploy to trick minority audiences out of their hard-earned money to see this. And since the Asian boy was gay I guess they got one more notch on their PC gun belt.The worst part was realizing that since Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo are both over forty this is what they have to settle for to get lead roles. Talk about a waste of talent. I'd hate to have heard the dinner table conversation when they got home at night after a day on the set. Add Linda Hunt (that Oscar can't get her decent parts?) and Rip Torn: thankfully they don't have all that much screen time.I notice that the viewer rating for the original film is twice what the rating for this one is. Obviously many other people feel the same way I do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 11-year-old daughter loved "Yours, Mine and Ours." Of course, my daughter loves all movies, including the one from earlier this year about the talking zebra. On the way out from "Yours, Mine and Ours," she commented, "That was a great movie, wasn't it, Dad?""Yeah, it was great," I lied.This is a cold, often times mean-spirited movie involving scheming children hell-bent on destroying their parents' marriage. As plans are set in motion, the once loving relationship between the unsuspecting Quaid and Russo quickly deteriorates into heated arguments, hurt feelings and tearful nights. Charming stuff.There are very few laughs in this movie. Ten minutes of 18 kids doing their best to destroy their fixer-up lighthouse home was enjoyable. But as 10 minutes turned into 60 minutes of the same ? food fights, flying paint and spewing vomit ? I couldn't wait for this mess to come to an end.No substance, no warmth, no charm. "Yours, Mine and Ours" should have been about family fun. Well, at least my daughter liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hate for it to be yours, because I didn't like it when it was mine, so lets not make it either of ours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides having two punctuations in one simple title, Yours, Mine, and Ours has to be one of the most annoying remakes I've seen in recent years. Friday the 13th was a pretty annoying one, but because of context not content. How can anyone stay sane when there are eighteen kids running around, hyper speed for ninety tedious minutes? Jo Frost would lose her mind in this ruckus.Yours, Mine, and Ours is a remake of the 1968 film of the same name. Having never seen the original, from what I understand both films have eighteen kids, and the only major differences are the actors. Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda are replaced with Rene Russo and Dennis Quaid along with the kids which I won't take time explaining. But lets just say that coming from a teenager who doesn't want kids, this film was absolutely frightening.Frank Beardsley is a US Coast Guard Admiral widower who is managing eight kids. Helen North works as a designer and she has ten kids. Frank and Helen where sweethearts in High School, and are reunited after 25 years. After learning about each others kids they come up with the brilliant idea to marry and raise a family of eighteen. My first thought would be get the f**k out! Of course when raising eighteen kids of all different age groups the first thing that should come to your mind is let the kids meet and see if they form a tight bond. If not, maybe marriage isn't going to work. Nope. Not necessary. Without even consulting the kids (if you call a five minute estimated family talk when no kids can change the folks mind a consulting then okay) they make the indulgent move of marrying anyway. What a fun house. No one but the parents have any say in something that will effect their own life.So naturally, when the kids first meet everything goes haywire and fighting, bickering, hitting, beating, and arguing come constantly. The biggest problem is that Frank is shipshape (pun intended) and Helen lets the kids have freedom. Disciplined kids, free kids. Not seeing a very good connection. Maybe they should've RECONSIDERED marriage, and production on this film as well.The plus for the film was seeing both Drake Bell and Miranda Cosgrove in it. They worked for years on Drake &amp; Josh and I've always favored both of them. I lost touch and interest with Drake Bell after he quit Drake &amp; Josh , and as far as Miranda Cosgrove goes, once the first ten or so episodes of iCarly aired...lets leave it at that.One thing that angered me more than the film itself was Cartoon Network, the network I watched the film on. Not the fact that it was loaded with commercials, but how two big "C" and "N" mascots were popping up during the commercials. We're led to believe these bulky, headless annoyances are watching the movie with us and just getting off track? Why not make it believable and have the mascots actually say something that happens in the movie rather than have them ranting about turkey leftovers and football. Also the number of commercials making the viewers aware about "exercising" and "eating a healthy meal" uncountable and an even bigger annoyance than the mascots. Has childhood obesity become that much of a big deal that commercials alerting viewers of it's occurrence need to be on every kid's network. If kids are watching a movie on Cartoon Network, do you think they'll drop everything (in the middle of the movie" and dash outside to the nearest park and play a game? Logical, like the mascot's heads, is absent Yours, Mine, and Ours is what you would expect of a remake. A loud, overly clich, annoying state of affairs that has Dennis Quaid being hit off a boat, in the head, or into a can of paint one too many times to be passable. I've been known to enjoy slapstick like the works of Carrot Top and Chris Farley, although I have standards set for where I want my slapstick. Being hit in the head five times or more in a single movie is way past my standards.Starring: Dennis Quaid, Rene Russo, Sean Faris, Jerry O'Connell, Drake Bell, Miranda Cosgrove, Lil' JJ, Danielle Panabaker.

		<shortDescription>A cinematic travesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who created this movie and why? These questions are raised by this movie. In an attempt to be funny, the creators of this movie decided to resurrect a Lucille Ball- Henry Fonda movie that in its day was funny but almost thirty years later just doesn't do it. Although ostensibly a comedy, the movie does not inspire any laughs. One winces and cringes as the parents do everything they can to make fools of themselves. The slapstick is unfunny, the children are nasty and the parents are fools, especially the father played by Dennis Quaid. Put a bunch of kids under one roof and the results can be chaotic but not necessarily funny. If this movie contains any message it is this: love without discipline is bad for children. One must wonder who would have thought this movie would sell. Everything about this movie is cheesy. Even by commercial standards this movie is an artistic travesty, an assault on the audience's intelligence and does not even deserve inclusion in DVD land, the place where all flops eventually wind up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Widow Dennis Quaid (as Frank Beardsley) meets widower Rene Russo (as Helen North) just before their high school reunion. Eighteen children and twenty-five years ago, they were sweethearts. They instantly marry, robbing this "Yours, Mine and Ours" (1968) re-make of the sweet and funny courtship scenes played by Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda.Filmmakers update it by making six of Ms. Russo's children adopted (different ethnicities). An update might be interesting if some of the Beardsley-North children hooked up. But they dislike each other, have water fights, and spill paint. They plot to break-up their happily married parents. The family's pet pig gives Mr. Quaid a wet kiss. It's that funny.*** Yours, Mine &amp; Ours (11/23/05) Raja Gosnell ~ Dennis Quaid, Rene Russo, Sean Faris, Danielle Panabaker</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not like the original --- so what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original version with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball is one of our favorites and I, for one, am glad they didn't try to remake that story with a new cast. This is really a different story built on the same premise: a widow and widower -- each with a lot of children -- fall in love, get married, and the children are suddenly part of a new and much larger family. Unlike the original, the children don't get a chance to see this coming before it happens. The animosity is instantaneous, particularly since the Beardsley children are used to structure and organization in their lives whereas the North children have been very free and loose. The bonding of familial friendships between the children comes through their common purpose -- to destroy the relationship between their parents. There is something very profound about seeing two enemy groups come together for a common goal only to discover that they don't hate each other at all. A lot of the slapstick is over the top, but it is an entertaining 90 minutes with a message that will never grow old. I am glad to have both versions in my library.</fullReview>

I wish that it had better acting, a more executed plot, and maybe a little less romance.It is not necessarily a bad movie it just isn't a good one if you are over the age of 9. The bad acting combined with the romance created the ultimate sob story.I wonder if the director was just trying to make a fool out of the actors.I liked it the first time but the second time I watched it, I couldn't even finish it.

		<fullReview>A widowed Coast Guard admiral with eight children meets a free spirited handbag designer with her own twelve. They fall in love and get married creating a difficult period of adjustment for all the children and both parents as they try to reconcile two very different lifestyles and many different personalities.While a similar premise worked very well in The Sound of Music (without the vast numbers of children), it doesn't seem to work here. I found this to be a fairly predictable movie with a lot of the standard ways to try and get an emotional response and pull the audience's heartstrings. But it doesn't feel fresh here. There are a few funny moments in the film and the acting is not atrocious. But overall this is not a good movie. I've seen a lot worse, but this is nothing special. I understand this is a remake, but not having seen the original, I can't compare the two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never great but never horrible either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of the humour in this film does not work, because it is aimed towards children, with elements thrown in just in order to gain a reaction, such as vomiting, paint fights and a really disgusting pet pig. That said, a fair amount of the humour still does work, this being due, if nothing else, to the energy put in. It certainly is an energetic film, with the adolescent actors fighting off a poor script to deliver credible performances, and in particularly, Dennis Quaid deserves some applause. He is the perfect choice for the part - having also played semi-authoritarian husband/father figures in 'Far from Heaven' and 'Frequency'. Quaid is able to show both his love of military order and his love for his kids, and he is a good enough actor that he can always realistically change his character's mood to suit the situation he is in. His adult co-star, Rene Russo, is a lot less impressive. But Quaid alone keeps the film rolling.The best line in the film is delivered by Darrell (played by David Koechner) and in fact, the funniest moments of the film involve him on screen. Darrell is a Coast Guard buddy of Dennis Quaid's character, Frank. After meeting with his old high school sweetheart more than twenty years lately, Frank searches for her in Google, and then later tells Darrell about it, to which he exclaims "you googled another man's wife?". This joke is funny on two levels: children can recognise it as a modern joke, since we live in the days of the internet. However, it also rather adult, a play on the expression of "ogling another man's wife". While infrequent, multi-level puns like these help the film to progress along.The plot of the film is rather tiresome (a sort of cross between 'Cheaper by the Dozen' and 'The Brady Bunch') and it is always easy to see where the film is heading. However, the predictably of the film is not so much of a problem, because there is little effort to create dramatic tension or any real drama. It is most light-hearted, and full of some really silly jokes, I do not think that the filmmakers intended at all to make this version much more than an entertaining film of average cinematic quality. There is little depth, there are too many main characters to give us a chance to know them all as individuals, but neither is there much reason for the film to rate as anything less than ordinary at the worst. It has its vices, but they are small enough that there are virtues to atone.Visually, the film is never boring, and I think this is an important part in why it is so easy to sit back and watch it without constantly thinking "this is dumb". There is not much vision per se to the material, but there are some beautiful bits of art direction (night scenes with the lighthouse) and camera movements are used quite well. The cinematography is merely adequate at times (high/low camera angles only used when needed to further a joke) but it is not at all poorly shot, and there is one very interesting camera movement in which the camera jerks from a bird's-eye-view to eye-level, then slides down, and sort of twists around. Not necessarily meaningful, but it is at least not filmed like a play. Likewise, this is not great film-making, but at least some effort has been put in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some are saying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have seen the "real" version of this movie than the best (and maybe ONLY) way to enjoy this movie is to accept right off that it is not REALLY "based on a true story". With the exception of the names of the two central characters, the number of children involved, and that title, it is NOT really based on the lives of Frank Beardsely and Helen North Beardsely and their combined family. With that said, if you are really interested in that story, I recommend reading Helen North Beardsely's book "Who Gets the Drumstick" If you can do this, or if you have never seen the original, it's not a bad way to spend an afternoon, esp. if you have kids, who WILL like it! It has it's funny and touching moments and Quaid and Russo are good. Most of the kids do an OK job, but with so many of them you never get a real feel for their characters. And it does manage to send a message that adults who choose to blend their families sometimes forget....that just because THEY fell in love doesn't mean their kids will accept things as easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! Frank is lonely father of 8 children. His wife has passed away. Helen is lonely mother of 10 children and she doesn't have husband. He has died. Frank and Helen used to be lovers during their hight-school years and on the edge to get married. For some reason, which is never explained in the movie, it just didn't happen. And here they are - years later they meet and after few hours together this slept love wakes up and another few hours later they are married. No ceremony, no wedding, no asking the children.On the next day they tell the news to their children, and then gather them. So, what happens in Hollywood movie when two lonely parents get married and then get their kids together? They start fighting of course, they are totally incompatible. Have you got the picture so far? Then after some time of fighting the kids decide that they can't live this way (together) and they have to do something about it cuz the elders don't care and they start and create and execute plans make the lovers fight and split up. This way everything would be back as it was. And what happens when all these fighting brothers and sisters finally unite in favour of this great mission? A bond is slowly formed between them until they actually end up loving and respecting each other - like a real family.But while this is happening all these devilish plans give result and the lovers are about to go on their separate ways once again. But wait! This is comedy and the ending must be happy. And of course the mischievous children, which are alredy strong and loving team, realize that they have to "fix" the mess. Do I have to tell more? END OF SPOILERS In general, the story is to shallow and at some points undeveloped as well as the characters. Those of the kids are too stereotipical - mindless little creatures for the younger ones and nasty evil brats for the teens. Of course the many clichs aren't something to be left unmentioned. Every scene's outcome could be easily predicted cuz it doesn't divert too much from the famous patterns.Still, there must be some good things in it. It's the actors' performances. Dennis Quaid and Renne Russo did their best but obviously couldn't have done much considering the lame plot. Some of the child actors also did good job.4/10</fullReview>

The only problem is that they have 19 children in total.The film is a family comedy, so the plot is predictable and straightforward. Though the rivalry between the two camp of children is memorable, there is little else that can be applauded with this film. The jokes are repeated over and over. Seriously, the dad falls and then gets hit by stuff is simply not funny when we have to see it for the fifth time. And a bigger problem is that, that's the only joke in the film.There are a lot better family comedies out there, avoid this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching the movie with my nine-year-old son. We both thought it was a lot of fun. It could have been longer, some of the characters needed a little more development. However, it avoided the potential quicksand of telling each individual's story. Rather, it provided a quick snapshot of life in a diverse family large enough to field two sandlot baseball teams. The focus was right on - understanding others, taking time to get to know people, and respecting differences; many other awesome messages, as well. Having been raised in a somewhat smaller blended family, and having one of my own, I could relate to the parents' and the children's situation - the ensuing chaos, rivalry, and bonding. Great for some lighthearted entertainment and escape from reality without worrying about language, nudity, and violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the most recent "Cheaper By The Dozen", down to the "Brady Bunch", and the original Henry Fonda-Lucille Ball vehicle this is based on, films have long ago depicted the dynamics of extended families.Continuing that same premise, is this hyperactive, sugar-infused comedy which stars Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo as the leads.Quaid is Frank Beardsley, a strict coast guard admiral who runs his household like a navy ship by raising his eight children under a high disciplinarian regime. Then there's Russo, who portrays Helen North, a hippie-style handbag designer whose ten kids (some of whom are adopted), don't seem to have to follow any rules.Both recently widowed, Beardsley and North were high school sweethearts who reconnect at a class reunion and soon rekindle their romance, unaware of their respective broods.It doesn't take long for them to be married, and for their offspring to get acquainted, even though the youngsters take an immediate dislike to each other, and to their parents' marriage. From there, the kids learn to get along and conspire together just long enough to cause a rift between mom and dad.What then ensues, is Beardsley and North butting heads over their child-rearing methods, uncontrollable kids, physical slapstick, and the inclusion of a menagerie of animals which includes a pet pig.Naturally, one can't expect anything less than the sappy ending which can only be found within the typical television sitcom, which is pretty much how this film can be best described.Nonetheless, while it may not offer young viewers a lesson in exemplary behavior, it's still enough to keep them entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admiral Frank Beardsley(Dennis Quaid) is a widower with 8 children and his family is 'ship shape' running like a Swiss watch. Helen North(Rene Russo)is a widowed handbag designer with 10 kids and believes in individual self expression. Frank and Helen end up going to their class reunion and discover the love they once had is still there. Thus sparked the proposal of marriage before notifying their separate broods. The thought of one big happy family is not a number one hit with the chaotic 18 'siblings'...sabatoging the union of their 'high school sweethearts' parents becomes a collective mission.This comedy is not really funny; albeit some of the sight gags are humorous. Juvienile situations and the smiling Quaid and Russo seemed wasted on me. Also in the cast are: Linda Hunt, Jerry O'Connell, David Koechner and Rip Torn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few funny parts, but mostly painful to sit through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see the first pass a this story, in 1968, with Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda. Maybe I should have instead. Apparently this story is based very loosely on real people, the Beardsley family on the west coast. I say loosely, because from the little I read, their real story was no where near what is told in the movie. There were a few funny parts, but I found it mostly painful to sit through. Free DVD rental from my public library.Dennis Quaid stars as Frank Beardsley, Admiral in the Coast Guard, so he and his 8 kids are used to moving around often. As this movie starts, they have just moved to Connecticut, where Frank finished school years earlier. And by the way, Frank and his family are very organized. You have to be in his life, and all the children accept it. Plus, Frank's wife died just a few years earlier.Rene Russo co-stars. She is Helen North, who just happens to have 10 children, 6 naturally and 4 adopted from all over the world. her husband died a few years earlier, she does not like to be very organized, and her children accept that way of life. And, by the way, Helen and Frank were high school sweethearts that went their separate ways 30 years earlier.So, the story jumps into high gear right away when Frank and Helen realize at the high school class reunion that they are both single, haven't lost their attraction for each other, and, without informing either group of kids, come home married! So the whole movie is about how they cope with the melding of both families, which include 18 children from 4 to 18, an incompetent housekeeper, and a pet pig. SPOILERS. Right away the kids don't get along, instead of cooperating to make the big new house better, they end up fighting and make a mess. But their grander plan is more sinister. They plot to break up the marriage by doing things to get Frank and Helen at odds with each other. But, while they are going about that plan, circumstances at school get the kids to actually stick up for each other and bond, until they change their minds, confess the plan to their parents, so in the end all is well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's already enough information about the plot and characters of the movie that I won't waste time on yet another movie summary. Is it a good family movie? Yes, but only if you consider that swearing is minimal, general messages about family values are positive (pull together as a family, love each other in spite of differences, that sort of thing), and the humor is mostly clean (in spite of that nasty vomit scene); however, it's not what one would call a "quality movie" - choppy sequences, thin plot, acting just OK, ridiculously over-the-top slapstick. What's frustrating is, Hollywood is delivering total and complete crap movies by comparison (Bad News Bears, anyone?) that you find yourself liking it more than you should because it *does* contain something positive about family and morals and all the "good" stuff. You're almost grateful for this substandard movie because of the overwhelming amount of garbage out there that's phenomenally worse by comparison. When your choice is between eating dog's vomit or pea soup, you'll opt for the pea soup and find yourself confused that you feel grateful for it.</fullReview>

There really was a Frank Beardsly and a Helen North with a combination of 18 children- with the birth of a 19th after the marriage.I saw the promos and at first I was excited, but then I saw the changes to the story-- and it bothered me. The original had basis in truth- real people and a real family.You can tell this is a Nickelodeon film because of the number of times Dennis quaid get "slimed"- a true trademark of Mickelodeon. I would have loved a remake that explored the real family-- go back to the book written by Helen North "Who gets the drumsticks"-- and it could have been made more current-- but to change so much and make it so much of a slapstick comedy-- it was a shame.But it was good for a few laughs but otherwise a sad remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this family comedy, single parents Frank (Quaid) and Helen (Russo) plan to tie the knot -- but with 18 children between them trying to destroy their marriage. Frank has 8 children and Helen is the one with 10. At first when the BIG family moves in, the children don't get along very well. The get this crazy idea that they should try and break their parents up s they could go back to normal. The house turns into chaos. The older teens throw a party, the younger ones throw anything thats in sight, and that is what makes this movie become good.This film may seem a lot like the 2003 hit "Cheaper By The Dozen", but it's not. Yours Mine and Ours has more a story and more of a plot than Cheaper By The Dozen, but although, Dozen is far better and more original. I actually like both films when I compare them, but I knew what was going to happen with this film. The parents would get in a fight, seem to break up and the children gt together and try to stop what they were starting. But I laughed a few times at this movie and I felt that families should see this movie. Parents with a lot of children that bicker and fight should let their children see this movie and let them know the lesson in family.I felt that this was a fairly predictable family comedy, it is, but I looked at it as funny, bright and good. So this is why I am recommending this movie. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite what you may have heard, this is NOT a bad movie. It did its job- it entertained. It was not meant to be great- no movie in its "slapstick family fun" genre is. Fact is, this was a very decent movie, and certainly not one of the bottom 100 films of all time. I have not read the other user comments, nor do I wish to; fact of the matter is, I really don't care why the majority of people who visit IMDb hated this film. I cannot fathom a 3.1 rating, or that it is 99 on the bottom list. This movie was by no means horrible- the acting was good, the kids were great, and it was overall a very feel good film. Was it the greatest movie ever made? No. Was it one of the 100 worst? Definitely not. The film's main plot is of course what we'd all expect- two parents who are no widowed that meet and fall in love. Unfortunately, they both have an inordinately large amount of kids- one ten, the other eight. They are married without their kid's consent, and the kids decide to take matters into their own hands and break their parents up. This tired plot device is done with obvious familiarity- the filmmakers never strive for brilliance or originality; they are simply trying to make a fun family film ala the Brady Bunch (in fact, the Brady Bunch is even mentioned once). Naturally, the kids change their minds once it's too late, but they manage to save their parents marriage in the end anyhow. Obviously, there is nothing new with this tired contrivance of a plot. In fact, it's the feeling that you get throughout the movie that you've seen it all before that keeps it from achieving the extraordinary; the few things that set it apart, ie Mrs. Mundy and the pig, are used either too sparingly or too much, respectively. In other words, this movie covers no new ground in terms of plot- and thus, never attains any kind of distinction. To conclude, the movie is not bad- far from it, in fact. It is a good, family movie that never tries to be great- only decent. And that, perhaps more than anything else, may be what keeps this movie from being wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YOURS, MINE AND OURS (2005) ** Listless and arbitrary remake of the 1960s farce about two large families suddenly becoming one humongous one when former high school sweethearts Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo are reunited at their 20th class reunion and find themselves instantly getting married after rekindling their spark with the usual predictable results of 'hilarity ensuing' - 18 kids and miscellaneous animals (including a pig!) causing mayhem as they team up to try to get their new parents to break up. What is truly remarkable is that none of the aforementioned brood registers as being at all memorable! Although there are some moments of smiles here and there - largely at the slapstick expense of Quaid's career Navy man and Russo's carefree 'hippie' (yeah I didn't buy that one either) and a few life lessons that do ring true (i.e. family matters!) the entire thing feels regrettable forgettable altogether.

		<fullReview>Obviously, the basic plot of this one is based on the 1968 version with Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda but that's where the similarity ends. After all, if it were made to be identical it wouldn't be worth seeing and to attract interest it needed to be brought up to date. Although a little sappy, this film is what I would call a good lighthearted, family style movie with none of the harsh language or sexual connotations that have become a Hollywood standard which is refreshing and rare. The small amount of minor slapstick style comedy helps too. And by the attendance at the theater I'd say several people agree. Living on coastal Maine I found the setting for the house to be interesting too. If you're fancy is for violence, language or sexual situations this isn't for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with my family on thanksgiving, and its heartwarming. But, I don't think anyone enjoyed it more than my 8 year old daughter. She was laughing so hard at every "joke" that it made me laugh too. There were of times Dennis Quaid found his face in paint, glue, or slimy pool water, but slapstick humor isn't for everyone, my husband and 16 year old son were constantly rolling their eyes. I would say it was a typical family movie, but if you really want every one to enjoy the story, I would suggest renting the original Yours, Mine, and Ours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame remake with one distinguished feature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At 40 years old, I'm all too familiar with the original "Yours, Mine &amp; Ours," starring Henry Fonda &amp; Lucille Ball. My only reason for having any interest in that movie in recent times, is that the late Fred Karlin(composer for the theme from "Up the Down Staircase") was responsible for the musical score. However, Lucille Ball, Henry Fonda, and Fred Karlin are all dead, so I didn't expect anything relevant to the original. Part of the reason I wanted to see this otherwise pointless remake was yet another attempt to find a role where Danielle Panabaker isn't on the verge of tears... and on that quest, I can announce I've succeeded.Otherwise, the only other distinctions between this and the original, are that the original took place on the West Coast, while the remake takes place on the East Coast. Instead of joining the military like his old man in the original, the oldest Beardsly boy runs for student body president. Oh, and unlike Lucille Ball's Helen Beardsley, Rene Russo's doesn't get pregnant.My only hope is that if(God forbid) there ever IS a sequel to "Yours, Mine and Ours," it's not a carbon copy of "Cheaper by the Dozen 2," because that would show even more of a lack of originality on the part of Hollywood than you've got now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think many parents may "miss the boat" here just as I might have.Not wanting a bad seat in a crowded movie, I always ask "how many seats are left" when purchasing my tickets. I knew that something was wrong at this Saturday afternoon matine, when the ticket agent told me "we have only sold 11 tickets".Take your kids to see it if you want (or wait for it on TV), but do your kids a favor and reserve comment. The best thing about this movie is that it creates the opportunity to show them the original version made in 1968, staring Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda.Cost of seeing this movie with your child.... about $25.00. Cost of sharing the original version with them........ Priceless!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did the Lucielle Ball original no justice. I was horribly disappointed in the lack of motivation behind this script. The acting was mundane at best and the cast couldn't have had a more difficult time mulling around with their lines and portrayals as this feature vaguely resembled the 1968 film, and actually more closely resembled a pack of meandering zombies, bumping into each other as they rambled on through this tiresome movie. I was gravely mistaken when I went to see this in thinking it would even hold a candle to the original. The plot was hurried and made the audience assume a lot of things that were in the original. Many people haven't seen the first film and wouldn't understand the new one if they hadn't. Rene Russo's career suicide with this movie will only bring her already mediocre acting down to an all-time low, as well as the aging "has-been" Dennis Quaid, whose bumbling brother Randy Quaid's character of Eddie Johnson in National Lampoon's: Christmas Vacation has more street credit as a quality actor than he ever will. And the fact that this movie's only gimmick was to cram as many mishaps and accident prone siblings into one house is not only insulting to the paying moviegoer, but also to the classy original that relied on pure comedic talent and raw slapstick material to amuse and entertain the audience. I don't recommend this to anyone with $8 to spend on a movie, and I really don't wish this insane representation of entertain to anyone looking to rent one either. In fact, it should be banned from ever airing on any screen in any theater, home, rental store, or sidewalk display for the rest of the entire human history! What a let down :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lowest rating it will let you choose is 1/10, but I would have selected 0/10 if it was an option. After the first 5 minutes I knew I was in for a real loser. The plot is so predictable, the actors are horrible, and I cringed while counting the minutes. So often they try to invoke laughter with the dumbest stuff and really overplay and act it. I especially hated all the little stereotypical kids. The black kid, the gay Asian, and the soon-to-be-fat cheerleader. Also, I just couldn't believe how long some of the scenes took to get over, especially when you knew where they were heading in like 30 seconds. I could spend all day ripping this movie, but there is one redeeming point. I'm thinking on buying copies of this DVD and giving them as gifts to people I really don't like. I want to waste 2hrs of their life like mine was. I honestly feel angry just thinking about this sweltering piece of garbage!!</fullReview>

I'm not sure exactly where and when this movie was last a good idea. Someone must have considered it a very safe movie to make with a good chance to get a return on the money invested. The plot was changed a little bit from the classic version with Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda. The slapstick comedy is not very good and the movie just does not go anywhere. Since I had seen the original I knew everything that was going to happen. I think I will skip the new King Kong movie when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can Have All 18 Kids and this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film only because my 4 year old daughter was too afraid to sit through the "Chronicles of Narnia". That's OK, I understand that. If I was her age, I'd scream too. She did love this film, along with my 7 year old son, but unfortunately, unless you are under the age of say 12, there isn't much here to like."Yours, Mine and Ours" is based on a 1968 film. It's about a military dad who has 8 kids who meets a liberal hippie mom with 10 kids of her own. The two marry and the 18 kids are forced to get along with each other. They move the entire family into a fix me up lighthouse and naturally we have plenty of pratfalls, flying paint, food fights, and people falling off ladders. There is even a giant pig walking around. This is all cute for the younger crowd, but anyone else will be looking at their watch.The movie is predictable and probably resembles Cheaper By the Dozen more than anything with a little Parent Trap thrown in. It is harmless and the two leads (Dennis Quaid &amp; Rene Russo) do what they can with flimsy material. I guess it's not horrible, but frankly, this is a family I could do without. (**)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did no one involved in this remake realize the original film was based on a true story? I find it annoying that the screenwriter thought it was necessary to throw a few ethnic types into the mix of kids to give the storyline a contemporary twist. And why switch the number of children each parent had? In real life, it was the dad who had ten, the mom who had eight, and all of them were biologically theirs. Quaid and Russo are their usual likable selves, but can't salvage this unnecessary and egregiously unfunny slapstick version of life with the Beardsleys. If they were going to play fast and loose with the facts, they should have changed the names to protect the innocent and given the movie a new title, like "His, Hers, and Theirs (But Who Cares?)."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave this Thanksgiving turkey in the oven; see the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The advent of mixed families is certainly more relevant today than it was when this film was originally made in 1968 (with Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda in the leads); but that doesn't make this newer version a better film ? not by a long shot.That movie was quaint and cute for it's time, had a great, emotional conclusion and even inspired the television series, "The Brady Bunch." This is ? by far ? one of the worst films of the Year of Bad Films. It is directed by Raja Gosnell (which is appropriate because he was responsible for both horrid Scooby-Doo movies) as if he were hit on the head with a huge circus mallet. This picture tries to combine joy, love, comedy, pathos and crude slapstick into a rollicking family good time.It doesn't work. The leads, Renee Russo ("Two for the Money") and Dennis Quaid, "Flight of the Phoenix"), have no chemistry and the children ? all amazingly attractive, but talentless ? are nothing more than annoying and idiotic. The situations they are tossed into are far-fetched, ridiculous and, worst of all, totally unfunny. Not the best thing to say about a comedy.Frank Beardsley (Quaid) is a widower with eight mostly cute blonde, blue-eyed children, and a Coast Guard Admiral, to boot. He runs the family well, like a Coast Guard Admiral, constantly blowing his hornpipe, having them fall in and organizing them into work groups. After moving to New London, Conn. in one of the great plot conveniences of all-time, he meets widow Helen North, a free-spirited handbag designer who knew Frank in high school.Within one jump cut ? and without meeting each other's offspring ? the two tie the knot. Thus, when the families finally get together, the kids ? naturally ? hate each other. Among these "actors," there is every type of clich; a Boy Scout, a military cadet, a cheer- leader, a punk rocker, a grunge singer, a couple of sets of twins, two precocious little boys, and other assorted goofballs.Also, to keep things as diverse and politically-correct as possible, Helen adopted six of hers, including some Mexicans, Indians, a jive black dude and a gay Asian. It's like the floor of a Democratic National Convention. Add to this mishmash a pot-bellied pig (why directors think a strange pet is funny is way beyond me ? remember the duck in "The Pacifier"?), who makes about 100 appearances, including at a hardware store, at the kids' school, and in Frank's bed, and you have a recipe for Holiday disaster. It's like having the whole family over and your father gets falling-down drunk and knocks over the tables with the food on it. No, wait, that would actually be humorous. This movie is a bomb like none dropped on the slums of Baghdad by Dick Cheney.If this film were any more of a dog, it would be dragging its butt across the driveway. And, after the 10th fight in which the children mess up and destroy the house, a store and everything else in sight, you start to feel a little sick to your stomach.It was also more than a little embarrassing to see Quaid doing lame slapstick (he gets splattered with paint and vomit, covered with sand, knocked to the ground and falls in a wading pool full of slime), and playing second fiddle to a bunch of little brats. Of course, he deserves it for taking on this role once played so well by Henry Fonda.Russo, who allows her evil moppets to get away with anything, doesn't fare as bad ? unless you count her involvement in this travesty. Best to leave this Thanksgiving turkey in the oven, take a few extra minutes and find the original; you'll thank me for it.</fullReview>

To bring in the ours part, look at the original movie to help you make it. I like this movie, I really do...but they changed so many things.

		<fullReview>Yours, Mine and Ours is a romantic-family comedy that brings all the already-seen jokes in movie history. Rene Russo is very badly cast, as she was already made for Jennifer Coolige's roles (like Fiona, in A Cinderella Story), and her face lacks the artsy-motherly face for Hellen White. The script was very lousy, the kids spoke our of turn, and the story was a great story, but the script ruined it all, as did Rene Russo. Sound effects snap the reality in half, not even a four-year-old can believe it. Raja Gosnell-once in for all, he proofs he could do a lot better, if he had better casting ability, and did choose amateur's to write the script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin with a movie this bad. Bad premise, bad rewrite, bad directing, bad movie. I could hardly wait for it to be over.The original 1968 version of "Yours, Mine and Ours" was bad enough. It spawned the BRADY BUNCH TV Show which ran for 5 years so the concept has been pretty well played out.YMO 2005 "Parents" Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo have zero chemistry together on screen. I kept seeing her as Natasha from the Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle movie of 1999.This remake has every stupid clich and goes overboard in trying to make the organized father look like an idiot time and time again. He gets wacked overboard on his own sailboat, gets paint spilled on him and other stupid stuff along the same lines.Meanwhile, the kumbaya wacko, talking-stick mother apparently uses no discipline in her parenting regime and that is offered as the only acceptable methodology.Throughout, the designer-mother's free-thinking, no-rules household is promoted as the ideal and the more disciplined, buttoned-down Admiral's parenting style is portrayed as deficient and flawed.The mother's family of 10 kids turns out to have 6 adopted of every race which is even less realistic than "blending" a family of 18 kids in the first place. Of course the movie ends with one enormous family that wants to be together. A better ending would have been if Russo and Quaid had come to their senses and gotten divorced. Other than some nice shots of the boats on the water and some good music, the movie has nothing to recommend it.Save your time and money.</fullReview>

Needless to see the two sets of kids don't get along when forced to live together. They plot to break their parents up but in the end decide that was a bad idea. And in between we get all the crazy things that would go on in a house of 21 people. The younger kids make messes, accidents are waiting to happen, the pig gets painted, and the nanny is watching wresting as opposed to the kids.FINAL VERDICTS: OK, if you are looking for a silly comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When bad remakes Attack!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've gotten a chance to see this movie today on cable out of curiosity (that and plus nothing else was on at the moment); when watching this movie even though I've never saw the original 1968 film starring Lucille ball I thought the premise and idea of this remake to add a new twist of putting culturally diverse characters of different races into the mix was cool but with little screen times, bad character development, and the directors idea of making the older prettier Disney stars the leaders I was left unimpressed.As I said before this is a remake off the 1968 movie staring the late great Lucille ball and Henry Fonda; the story line is like this in a nutshell, two widowed parents Admiral Frank Beardsley (Dennis Quaid) the father of 8 kids who pretty much keeps his family on a military standard of order which as a military man myself that was a bit off but we'll get to that later and the mother Helen North (Rene Russo) who has at least 6 I believe (including adopted kids) where old high school lovers that wanted to marry each other but couldn't due to life changes finally meet up again years later and rekindled there love for each other and in a whimsical array suddenly married each other hours later..LOL (wait here's the fun part...actually I'm lying!) but before you know it all the kids become one big somewhat happy family and learn the value of love, teamwork, and togetherness....I have to say if you decide to rent or watch this movie, this is NOT cheaper by the dozen at least that movie was good! I usually put good points before the bad, but in this case there are very seldom good points and a lot of bad ones first of all the director Raja Gorsnell; Honestly if I wanted a director to put whole lot of screen time on the older pretty Disney teen stars I would watch the Disney channel otherwise it was a bad move and somewhat selfish on his part; that said, there were lack of character developments all around and as much as Quaid and Russo's character worked pretty good the kids didn't. And because of the lacking of development of the characters you don't understand how some of the kids on Russo's team got adopted all you just know is that she adopt them. That's it, nothing more, end of story!The good point is that I like the diversity of characters it was very cool to see a colorful array of characters of different cultures and that's all well and good but with this comes the bad side; the only black kid stays always in the back never really have that much screen time as the others and even still he's hardly on camera cause the Director was so mesmerized by the older pretty Disney teen stars than that of the other kids at hand. And because of this, you have a convoluted brand of typical and somewhat odd stereotype if you look closely enough it's like having Mickey Mouse, Donald duck, and goofy having a party but very rarely you see Chip and dale show up just for little color and obviousness that they are there. Dennis Quaid's character as the tough as nails Admiral father was as tightly off as a abusive parent...being that I use to be in the military I've realized NOT all fathers in the military are like that...sure they put the values of order, and family they also are fun loving parents too; His character was a tightass, stick in the mud and it was way over the top.On "Cheaper by the dozen" the focus isn't just on Steve martin or bonnie hunt or the dude from smallville, EVERYONE had equal time and share and this made the move fun and great with its equal character development and very fun story to keep people interested even the sequel somehow put that first before everything else; this movie did NOT it not only showed favoritism but it didn't work with the characters its odd embrace only clashed the movie instead of binding it together like glue and that is how bad remakes attack. After watching this movie I didn't think of family togetherness my only thought was...what the hell!! All in all, if you are really bored and want to watch something then this movie is for you...I honestly found this movie campy and cheesy at the same time but if you want to watch a good example of a family film check out, "Cheaper by the dozen" cause after seeing this you might want to watch something funny to get the bad taste out your mouth cause this movie is only Disney stamped and lacking in areas that should of been worked on.4/10</fullReview>

The outline is- Two people with lots of kids who are opposites get married. The kids split the parents up but had to work together to do it and feel guilty about splitting up the parents so they get them back together. Exactly that. How predictable is THAT!?!?!

Even my fifteen year old asked me to buy it on DVD. My kids and I have also seen the original and although this script strays from the storyline of the 1960s version, it still stays true to the basic idea as much as possible. Considering the fact that times have changed since the original was made, I thought the writers did a wonderful job of making the script contemporary and believable. I recommend that all families watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Beardsley (Dennis Quaid) and Helen North (Rene Russo) are complete opposites. Frank is an admiral in the military. He runs a tight ship, his four year old son habitually calls him "admiral" instead of dad, and calls his family his "crew". Helen, however, allows free expression among all her children; her house is crawling with painters, gardeners, musicians, dogs, cats, and a pig. This movie stresses the old clich "opposites attract".The two were old high school sweethearts and meet again at their high school reunion. Then, during and romantic dance on the ballroom floor, they fall in love again, then they reveal their secret: Frank has eight kids, Helen has ten. Chaos erupts when the eighteen children move into a lighthouse together.They play hilarious, not to mention creative, pranks on each other. One such is when the North kids set of the smoke alarms while the Beardsley children are in the bathrooms. It becomes clearer to their parents that no one is happy with this except them with the situation.The eighteen soon realize that, in order to be sure they never have to see each other again, they have to break up Mom and Dad. Who better than them to know what best annoys their parents? Now their teamed up against the "greater enemy" and begin focusing their energies towards splitting their folks up and they suddenly forget to hate each other.A cute comedy with more than it's share of funny and family moments. It's great to bring the kids to, and the adults will like it too; the humor is neither childish or slapstick.</fullReview>

We enjoyed watching messes happen. That's the way that kids are. Adults don't understand the fun that's within this movie.I own and have watched the original and this newer one multiple times. I admit that their story lines are different, but that doesn't mean that the second one is horrible. They are different, but the second one doesn't take away from the original. It just tells a different story.It's not like they named it Yours, Mine, and Ours 2. It doesn't have to be the same to be "based" on the original. When they say that it was "based on the original" they are saying that it's also about the struggles that two parents go through to try and combine two totally different families. That's all that "based" means.The way I see it, is that if the parents/adults don't like it, fine, but remember that kids go on this website too and that this movie is a children's/family movie, not an adult movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading some of the comment and everybody has been comparing the new version with the old one. Heres the thing the old one was made in 68, things have changed since then. Someone like me, whose 17 enjoys the newer version a lot more. When a movie can get different emotions out of the viewers, it means it was well done. I laugh in this movie and i cried. I find the actors carried well there roles and we convincing. If the new version is not exactly like the old on it doesn't mean its not good, it simply means that it was adapted to fit in todays world. I recommend this movie to anybody that wants to watch a relaxing movie with a group of friends or with their family. You wont be disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Lowbrow awful remake of the 1968 classic brings nothing good, but the same usual shtick and the same usual idioticness, Dennis Quaid stars as a Former Navy Solider and Renee Russo plays the mother of so many children, (Don't even ask), because quaid also has big children as well, so that makes a grand total of 18 kids, there is a pet pig in the house, usual disasters, is this a stupid movie?, I Think so.The Acting is terrible, especially dennis quaid, who's been good in other things, Rene Russo is wasted, the kids are not interesting, there is zero chemistry between renee and dennis. Why would they remake garbage like this?, Look at what happen to the jackal 8 years ago with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere and that was also garbage.This is one of the year's Worst Films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute, funny, family film not deserving the Bottom 100 treatment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Yours, Mine and Ours" is a remake of the 1960s (I think) movie bearing the same name. This movie reminds me a lot of the "Cheaper by the Dozen" remakes which my family loves so much, and I think is better than this movie. So why the "10" instead of a "1" like most other people? Two words: Drake Bell. Yes, he does play music, and many people hate a movie with musicians taking the camera, but I think he best suited a spot in this film. For one, if you ever watch his show on Nick, he's a womanizer, sort of a sex machine (and a tame one at that!), almost, except this is a teen show, so it can't be that bad. "Yours, Mine and Ours" is a good film, and too bad for the other people, because they think it's a waste for the four studios that teamed up to provide us with this stroke of genius!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello. My name is Agent DX, MI-6. Let me tell you about a movie that is a god awful remake of the Lucille Ball movie. It is about a COast Guard Admiral who marries a beautician and has 18 kids, he of ten, she of eight. The mischief is bad, the jokes are bad, and Rene Russo is one bad girl. Whenever I hear Drake Bell scream "Fire!" the Dark One is summoned, and then I run. Me and my dad saw that at the Palisades Mall but-uh oh-we saw the entire movie, instead of bailing out of it, like most bombs. Dad said it was cute, but he didn't listen. I liked it, but the reviews were bad, and that was not fair. The wedding scene is the only one you should enjoy. This movie is the pits! It's not funny at all. So they sent him to a vet to cut off both his boa- boa- boa... Boy, that wasn't fun, fun, fun! He never learned you can have fun, fun, fun. But less is more! THey may ship you off to school, so rein it in a little! YOu can't spell fun without "U" in the middle! Human, this cat is currently in violation of...17 of your mother's rules. City morgue! Eighteen! Anyways, this movie is a lot-kids movie you should not see. I didn't listen, and neither should you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank (Dennis Quaid) and Helen (Rene Russo) are both single parents of large families, due to the death of their spouses. Natch, they are also long lost high school sweethearts about to meet again. And, what a meeting! It does not take long for them to express vows to one another, all without telling the children. Once the deed is done, they find a converted lighthouse big enough to accommodate all of the rugrats. However, Frank is a coast guard admiral who ran his own family like a tight ship while Helen was a free-spirited, it's all good kind of parent. Will they all get along? This nice movie is family friendly and replete with good messages. Quaid and Russo are comely performers who ace their respective roles and the delightful children warm hearts. The setting on the east coast is gorgeous, too. But the best part of the film is the small role belonging to Linda Hunt, as the live-in housekeeper/nanny. Her acid tongue and small dynamo figure elicit mirth in every screen moment she has. Do watch this film with your loved ones. It is one of those sit back and snuggle films that everyone will find worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My own review of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that Yours, Mine and Ours was a really cute movie, maybe not as good as the original with Licille Ball and Henry Fonda, but I thought this one was still good. My Dad was in the Military so I can relate to a lot of the military comments and stuff. I don't think a lot of people got the military stuff (the jokes, the moving around, going to a new school, etc.), so if you're not familiar with the military then you probably won't get a lot of the jokes. They did leave some things out from the old one, changed some details and added a few things. But in this day and age with movie making how can't change some things when remaking a movie. Plus if you're remaking a movie why keep everything the same? Then you could just go see the original.If you haven't seen the original then go rent it now, it's a great movie. If you liked this one you'll love the old one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as bad as I expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never really seen these "large family" family films, so my expectations were pretty low to begin with.It seems that there have been a lot of negative reviews of Yours, Mine, and Ours when it really wasn't that bad. It's silly. A lot of things happen without any real sense of why they're happening. But it's fun. It's even good.It hearkens back to the day of Double Dare, Doug, Rugrats, and Ren and Stimpy on Nickelodeon. A time before Pokemon and 10-year olds with camera phones. It's messy, it's funny, and one scene is a bit sexy, though it's not what the directors had in mind when they made it. (Paint fight between the two oldest girls of the opposing families! Spoiler, I suppose.) A lot of people wouldn't like it because it doesn't really have a point or a message. But there's nothing wrong with a movie that's just there for entertainment, as long as the movie accepts and realizes that that's all it's good for. Yours, Mine, and Ours knows it's just for fun, and it runs with that and the result is a pretty good movie.I've never seen Cheaper By the Dozen, but I might see 1 and then 2 since I was pleasantly surprised by this flick. (Forumla: Quality of movie = This one... Giant Family Movie + Steve Martin - Hillary Duff = Giant Family Movie) It's better than Chicken Little, the movie that Disney has somehow told everyone to see. I would recommend this for families, maybe for others. But there definitely are better non-family films.There's some talented acting, especially among the four oldest kids, and the little kids are really cute, but not vomit-inducing... cute.</fullReview>

I really liked it when the pig kissed the dad on the lips and when the little kids started falling out the window. Those parts and other parts are what really made the movie good. The downside to the movie: I'm not a romance type of person. The kissing really got to me, but not enough to affect what I thought about the movie. I also loved the music. Drake Bell is an awesome singer and he sounded even better singing with Hawk Nelson. I LOVE that song as much as I love the movie. I rate it ten stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this is based on a true story, it's still a ripoff of Cheaper By The Dozen. Yours, Mine And Our was based on a story from 1968. Cheaper By The Dozen is based on a story from 1950, 18 years before the other. Still, I'm giving it a 9. Just based on the fact that Hilary Duff is in Cheaper By The Dozen. I hate Hilary Duff with a passion. A stick figure with over-sized head and teeth that has no talent. Anything that WAS talent was sucked out by Hilary's completely worthless boyfriend, Manskank II aka. Joel What's-his-face. Back to the movie. Even having Alyson Stoner in CBTD couldn't save it. And I hate saying that, seeing as Steve Martin is one of my favourite comedians.</fullReview>

I think I'm glad my own military dad isn't as strict and orderly as the one in the movie. That's so cool that the North family has a pig in the house. It's funny that the pig eats at the table!

Most of the reviews were vicious, and for the life of me I can't figure out why. The movie is predictable, and a bit campy. However it features two functional families, who love each other, but can't accept the changes they are facing. No it's not realistic, but I can live with that. I find it a refreshing to see a film with limited potty humor, stupid parents and wise-ass kids.I enjoyed Quaid and Russo, and the younger cast members. I actually felt the kids were a little better developed than in the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although on the surface this is a pretty predictable formula flick with stereotyped characters and standard slapstick pratfalls, it deserves high marks in my opinion. From the leads to the littlest of them, the cast performs flawlessly and puts heart in their parts. The choices of set and setting are fun and intriguing, adding surprise and significant interest to the flick. And the cinematography is dramatic and crystal-clear, bringing out the best in these already-interesting elements. It is lovingly done and a credit to the genre.Anyone who has seen the trailer will walk into this movie knowing just about what to expect from the story. What they'll get is just what they expect and a lot more, not from the plot line but from the thousands of details through which the story is delivered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than the Trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the fact that Yours, Mine and Ours 2005 can't hold a candle to the original 1968 movie, this new movie is not as bad as I thought it would be. Although it wasn't nearly as good as what I wanted it to be either.First off, this movie has absolutely nothing in common with the real North-Beardsley story. The filmmakers never even bothered to contact Frank (who is now 90) or any of his 20 children to let them know this movie would be made, which shows total lack of respect, class and decency on their part.The trailers and commercials don't do this movie justice. It's not really a fair representation of the movie. I wouldn't call it a 'family' comedy. It's more a movie for young children, although I find that Frank saying the words "pissed off" in front of the children was very inappropriate! And Dylan's suggestion that the parents find Miranda and Phoebe in lesbian sex was equally inappropriate and in very bad taste! Much more so since this is a kids' movie! The story itself is not bad, almost plausible, except for the fact that Frank &amp; Helen marry impulsively. Forget the 18 kids, what responsible parent would realistically do that? The movie is very Disney-ish, which in my opinion is a good thing. The slapstick comedy may make some people laugh. I chuckled, but generally didn't find the movie funny. My wife found it cute.What I didn't like is that it's very choppy. You get the feeling that they forgot to tell us something between this scene and the next. The slapstick scenes are too long and the "story-telling" scenes are too short. The movie would be much better if they spent less time on the slapstick and took the time to develop the kids' characters. It would have been a better movie had it been longer. I came away feeling like they didn't tell me the whole story, only the point-form story.The small boys, Lao, Ely, Otter, Aldo and Ethan are extremely cute! That's the film's best asset! Of course the best line in the movie is by 4-year-old Ethan who says "I don't want to loose another mommy!" The Indian twins, Bina and Marissa were loud-mouthed pains, but I guess they did a good job, because that's what their characters are like. The middle kids, Naoko, Harry, Michael, Mick, Kelly, Jimi and Joni all were good in their rolls and had interesting characters, but they all get blurred together. Sean Faris who plays the eldest, William, was not at all believable in the role of big brother. He looked the part, but he didn't act it. The teens, Christina, Phoebe and Dylan were good and believable. It's just too bad we didn't get to know the kids better, because all of them had interesting characters.Dennis Quaid plays the father, Frank, who is 48 years old. Sorry, but Dennis looked WAY older than 48! He needed a lot more make-up to hide his real age. He actually looked older than his real age, 51. He also is not at all believable as a military man. He doesn't exude any authority what so ever. All he knows how to do is blow his whistle and yell. That's not authority. That's someone who's out of control. They should have picked another actor for the role.Rene Russo plays Helen who is also 48. She hides her age (51) well. She's also believable as a free spirited person, but she's not at all believable as the mother of 10. She looks too anorexic to have given birth to 4 kids. She also doesn't look motherly at all. The character Helen is also a big slob! "A house is for free expression, not good impression." Maybe if you're alone, but with 10 kids? Yeah, right! The multiple animals were fun and in Helen's family it's believable that they would have several animals. But who ever thought up the idea of having a pig as a pet in this film is out of his mind! Who has a pig for a pet inside city limits? Come on! Let's get real here. The pig was way over the top, very obnoxious and really made the movie look cheesy.I wondered what Linda Hunt, who plays the housekeeper, Mrs. Munion, was doing in the story. Can a family of 20 really afford a maid? Why would you even need a maid when you have many capable hands to help with the housework? I liked the character. She was funny and well played, but unfortunately she was totally useless to the story.It may not sound like it, but all in all I liked this movie. It's just sad to know that the filmmakers didn't care enough about the project to put in the effort to make it a much better film, when it would have been so easy to do so.</fullReview>

Sparks fly, both are widowed and lonely. They both decide to start where they left off in high school. But can they? She has ten kids and he has eight.This movie was cute, but that is about it. I would say it is a fun family movie, but I am afraid people would get bored. Not much happens. You have 'The Brady Bunch' from hell where his and her kids do not get along. The kids conspire to break up the parents. But in the end, learn that they all care for one another and that they are now a complete family. That is about it.If that sort of plot appeals to you, then go for it. Otherwise I would not see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the new 'Yours, Mine and Ours' last night. Having seen the original 2 or 3 years ago, I already knew the whole concept of the movie and what was going to happen. I wasn't expecting much of it seeing as how my friend had told me it got one star in a review. However, I thought the 2005 "Yours, Mine and Ours' outdid the original and had definitely deserved more than just one star. The humor in the movie was far beyond that of 'Cheaper By the Dozen''s which I also happened to enjoy. 'Yours..' is a wonderful movie for the whole family to see. Also, the cast that was chosen was perfect. Bringing in stars such as Rene Russo, and Dennis Quaid, as well as young &amp; rising celebrities such as Drake Bell, Sean Faris, Danielle Panabaker, etc., were great decisions on the casting director's part. With the cast that was chosen, especially the children, I felt I was able to enjoy the movie more than I would have if there were bad actors. I can only wait for a sequel to come. Until then, I shall see the upcoming 'Cheaper By the Dozen 2'. In conclusion, AWESOME!</fullReview>

Russo and Quaid were great playing two parents who had recently gotten married and forced their very different 18 kids together. Obviously, the kids were angry and didn't want the relationship to work out. The teenage and kid actors were hilarious and there was an excellent contrast of characters. A lot of people have scorned upon the movie, but this is because they are expecting the original. The movie was very good, in my opinion, though it had a hard sell because it's a remake. It was like 'The Parent Trap' meets 'Cheaper by the Dozen.' Check out the movie and ignore what all these people say, because they're wrong!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Enjoyable Family Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yours, Mine and Ours is a funny enjoyable family movie, that is much better than the critics' reviews. I have found that critics tend to review each movie with a negative mindset, unless it is a blockbuster, or a small artsy movie. Then they lean more to the positive mindset. There tend to be three types of movies that critics mostly always view negatively, and those are slapstick, remakes and sequels. Since Yours, Mine and Ours can be described by two of those definitions, it really hadn't a chance as far as the critics are concerned. However, the movie is not only composed of those elements.While the movie title makes it seems like a remake of the 1968 Lucille Ball/Henry Fonda movie, technically the only thing similar is the names of the parents. The movie is really about how two large, single parent families, with different parenting styles, try to coexist. Think of Oscar and Felix (of the Odd Couple) if they had 10 and 8 children, respectively.Rene Russo plays Helen, the earth mother, "Mia Farrow" prototype, with a relaxed parenting style and a cluttered house. Dennis Quaid plays Frank, the Coast Guard Admiral who is a stickler for rules and regulations, but clearly loves his children as much as Helen does.Frank and Helen were college sweethearts, and reconnect on a reunion cruise, impulsively marrying and shocking their offspring. There is the chaos that comes from the merging of two large families and slapstick is inevitable.However, to label this movie as a slapstick, Three Stooges , Soupy Sales type movie is all wrong. There are those elements in it, but the love between Frank and Helen, and the love they have for their children is definitely evident. It is not the sappy, saccharine love that was evident in 60's television shows like Family Affair, but more like Leave It To Beaver, or even 80's shows like the Wonder Years. I have had friends with big and blended families, and the portrayals in this movie are on the mark.Dennis Quaid is fabulous as Frank. He can be silly in the slapstick scenes, but tender in the love scenes, and can switch back and forth with ease. He is a natural. He and Rene Russo have great chemistry, and Rene also did the slapstick parts without missing a beat. The actors who played the children were natural without being obnoxious. Linda Hunt was marvelous as the housekeeper. Think Alice on the Brady Bunch if she was allowed to be uninhibited.Much comments have been made about Fiona the pig, but I thought it was inspired to include a pet like that in the movie. It fit in perfectly with Helen's free spirited brood.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, romance, and family films. The audience I saw the movie with was a mix of children and adults, all of whom laughed appropriately and clapped at the end. If this is your type of movie, don't allow the critics to sway you. See it for yourself, I think you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A light, funny, family film - true to its Nickelodeon roots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a light, funny family film. Rene Russo and Dennis Quaid hit their roles just about right; and the kidz are all cute and charming, even when they are being brats.This would be a better movie if it were a notch more emotionally serious at all levels in the vein of "Because of Winn-Dixie" or "Dreamer." What we have here is more of a "Slappy-and-the-Stinkers Krazy-Kidz-Kaos-Komedy" vehicle.Russo and Quaid are engaging as widowed parents very much desperately in love (and lonely, after losing their spouses); they give good performances spotlighting the stresses of parenting and dealing with (super-sized) blended family issues; but the engaging "adult" moments are quickly and inevitably subsumed by the next 5 minutes of Nick-style juvenile slapstick mess-making. My kidz will love it and yours will too(and you will laugh with them). If you're a married adult with kids, you will empathize with much and laugh quite a bit; yet at the end of the movie you might feel just a little bit cheated. Or not. Who knows, you might end up with a little bit of dust in your eyes (which is what this Dad sometimes tells his kids at the movies).PS. It's great to see the Coast Guard spotlighted in a film. Those guys rock!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is about one man, Frank Beardsly, with eight children and a woman, Helen North, with ten children who get married. The catch is they have completely different lives and rules. Frank(Dennis Quaid) is an Admiral in the Coast Guard. His lifestyle is all about being organized and respectful. Helen(Rene Russo) is a fashion designer. Her life is free living. She believes that children should be expressive the way they want to. When they get married, their children don't exactly see eye to eye. They can't agree on anything and are constantly messing up the other family's lives. They devise a plan to break their parents up so they won't have to live together. In the process, they realize that they can learn to get along. The movie is filled with laughs and touching moment. It's like a modern day Brady Bunch. It teaches you to try even the hard things in life. Who knows, maybe the hard things could be the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got to see this film yesterday in a private screening for the audience of the Dr. Phil Show. Adorable cast of children and animals. The pot belly pig was amazing. Loved the chemistry between Russo and quaid. I saw the original and this was not exactly presented the same way, but just as good. There may have been a little too many Pratt falls, but I laughed out loud, relaxed in my seat, shed a few tears and although the ending was predictable, no one cared. This is not a film with mystery and suspense., just fun and a little tenderness. I especially liked the sail boat escapade. Like Home Alone, we know the ending, but enjoy the antics. It is a delightful movie. It is definitely a family movie, but the audience should be warned to not try any of this at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drake Bell rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard about this movie, it was going to be like Cheaper By The Dozen x 1 1/2. Boy was I wrong until I learned that Drake Bell's in this movie, I had to go see it. In fact, he's the male Hilary Duff! His character (just like on Drake &amp; Josh) likes to play the electric guitar &amp; sing in a band. However, it would've been better if he had sang "Down We Fall" during the wedding reception. I consider that tune he wrote a classic ballad.I hope this will help Drake Bell's acting career out as well as his music, since he's familiar to those who have cable TV (Nickelodeon). Drake Bell rules!</fullReview>
