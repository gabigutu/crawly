		<shortDescription>Best Family Movie of the 60's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I had trouble with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in the leads largely because they both were really too old to play their respective characters (Ball was about 57 at the time and Fonda about 63). In the end the film is so well done that I forgot about that. Aside from the film "Please Don't Eat the Daisies", this is probably the best family movie of the 60's. The best thing about the film is the realistic way in which the family blends together. The usual problems are all there and the way in which Fonda and Ball deal with it is about what one would expect, a certain amount of good intentions, a bit of mistake making, sacrifice, and providing a good deal of love and support. The writing may not be politically correct in this day and age (the scene where Fonda's kids get Ball drunk, Ball spanks one of the boys, and there is also a certain amount of gender stereotyping), but it is this that gives the film its appeal and relatability. As Leonard Maltin points out, look for a some well known faces in the supporting cast. Tom Bosley as the doctor, Tim Matheson as Mike, a four or five year old Tracey Nelson, Morgan Brittany of Dallas fame, 70's TV staple Ben Murphy as the oldest daughter's boyfriend, and well known child actor Eric Shea who gives an endearing performance as young Philip, the kid that seems the most lost in the big family. All in all Dad Fonda sums the whole thing up when he describes for the oldest daughter (who's being pressured by the boyfriend to have sex) what love is really about and how this family is staying together, "It isn't going to bed with a man that proves that you love him it's getting up in the morning and facing the drab, miserable, wonderful everyday world that counts. I suppose having 19 kids is carrying it a bit too far, but if we had it to do all over again who would we skip, you?" And that is exactly what Helen and Frank are doing together, and the kids admire and respect them all the more for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Yours Mine And Ours" is one of the best "family films" of the 1960s. (Very) loosely based on the real-life story of Helen North, a Navy widow with eight children, who married Navy career man Frank Beardsley, a widower with ten children of his own. Lucille Ball bought the rights to Mrs. Beardsley's book "Who Gets The Drumstick?", co- produced it, and took the starring role of Helen North. For those who know her chiefly as a comedienne, this film will be a pleasant surprise. For not only does she have the opportunity to indulge in some of the slapstick she is famous for, she proves conclusively that she was an excellent dramatic actress as well. Moreover, she can switch abruptly (and seemingly effortlessly) from comedy to pathos, sometimes in the same scene! Henry Fonda takes the part of Frank Beardsley and gives it both dimension and strength. As his bachelor friend, Van Johnson is a welcome presence, as is Tom Bosley as a sardonic doctor. There is also a hilarious performance from Louise Troy, as Frank's date early in the story. The kids are well cast and include future notables Tim Matheson, Suzanne Cupito (who grew up to be Morgan Brittany), Mitch Vogel and Tracy Nelson. A good deal of the plot involves the mutual dislike most of the kids have for their step-siblings, but a great deal of charm is present as well. Aiding the production is a nice score by Fred Karlin, a lovely song "It's A Sometimes World", and handsome San Francisco location photography. A remake has just been completed and will be released around the holiday season, but it's not likely to top this one. Incidentally, if you read the original book by Helen Beardsley, you will most likely come away with a far different picture of the Beardsley family, one which may not have transferred as well to the screen. This may also explain why there is no mention of the book as the story source in the movie's opening credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were asked what my favorite film of all time was, I would probably say either "The Last Picture Show" or "Ordinary People," two films that I feel are legitimate masterpieces. But if I were asked what my favorite film of all time REALLY was, I'd have to say "Yours, Mine and Ours," which was one of the first movies my parents ever took me to (along with a re-release of "Swiss Family Robinson" and Steve McQueen's "Bullitt") as a five-year-old. I've loved it my entire life, and I have to admit my affection for it hasn't dimmed with age. Although I realize it's not one of the great masterpieces of all time, and I would never rate it as high as say, "Show" or "People" or "Casablanca" or "Schindler's List" for that matter, I still love this film all the same.I must admit that I am also a lifelong fan of "I Love Lucy," so the fact that "Yours, Mine and Ours" stars Lucille Ball certainly has something to do with my fondness for this film. And growing up in the '70's when co-star Henry Fonda was relegated to cameo roles in awful films like "The Swarm" and "Rollercoaster," if it hadn't have been for his charismatic and likeable performance here, I would never have known he was the great actor that he was. Add the pleasure of Lucille's longtime friend Van Johnson in the prime supporting role of Darryl, Fonda's best friend, and an extremely young Tim Matheson as Fonda's oldest son, and you have the foundation of an excellent cast in a lovely romantic comedy about the ultimate blended family (think "The Brady Bunch" with brains, and much, much larger to boot).Very loosely based on a true story, Ball is Helen North, a recent widow with eight unruly children who moves to San Francisco for a fresh start. While working at the infirmary at an (unnamed) Naval base, she meets Naval Officer Frank Beardsley (Fonda, of course), who is a recent widower himself (with 10 children !) and has brought one of his daughters (Suzanne Cupito, aka '70's starlet Morgan Brittany) in for treatment. Helen and Frank are immediately smitten with each other and go out on a date, but immediately break it off when they realize how many children their combined family would contain. Darryl realizes that eighteen children aside, these two were made for each other and proceeds to plot to get them together. They do eventually marry and this sets up many amusing scenes of this huge family trying to blend in together. The nice thing about this film is that for once Lucille Ball is allowed to play a character completely different from Lucy Ricardo or Lucy Carmichael (from "The Lucy Show"). She is intelligent, touching, funny and very, very human here. In only one scene does she do any kind of "Lucy" shtick, and that is during a wonderfully played drunk scene. Even then she doesn't resemble her daffy TV persona as much as, well a woman who's had too much to drink. And the chemistry between Ball and Fonda is so believable, as a child I found it hard to believe they were not really married in real life! Honest! Johnson gives wonderful support and Tom Bosley has a few amusing scenes as the family's exasperated doctor. I also loved the character of Madeline Love, who Darryl sets Frank up with on a disastrous date that ends with her riding home between Frank and Helen (who's been dumped by her Darryl-arranged date). Their discussion of their respective families ends with the hilarious exchange: Frank: "I'm glad I have ten children!" Helen: "I'm glad I have my eight!" Madeline: "And I'm glad I'm careful!"All in all, this is an extremely enjoyable romantic comedy that grandkids can watch with their grandparents where everyone will be entertained and nobody will be embarassed. An added treat: laughing at the '60's styles and hairdoes, which look worse and worse with each passing decade. They just don't make them like this anymore. ***1/2 (out of *****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My Favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic comedy features Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda reunited. Ball plays a widow with 8 children while Fonda plays a widower with 10 children. The two get married and try to unite the families as one. With 20 different personalities in one home, things get more than a little tough. There is one scene where one of Fonda's children spikes Lucille Ball's drink. She gets drunk and makes a fool of herself, much to the delight of the kids. I love that scene. Her runny makeup and slurring words are just hilarious! This movie has recently been the victim of a terrible remake starring Dennis Quade. If you found that entertaining in any way, you will love the original. It is a wonderful, funny movie that is safe for all ages. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love This Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always just loved this movie! I saw it as a teenager in the 60's, getting ready to go off to college and thought it was great fun at that time. Since I was a teenager, I remember really enjoying the character of Mike, played by Tim Matheson. I always thought he would go on to be a real big movie star instead of TV movies, since he had lots of charisma and maturity at that young age. However, he has done very well in the roles on television he has played and is always a real treat to watch. I don't think I thought Lucille Ball was too old the first time I saw it, because anyone over 25 seemed old to me at the time! I recently caught this movie on TV and enjoyed it again from an adult perspective. It was a little corny but still a good film. Life in the sixties even with Vietnam and all was a much more innocent time especially with what kids face today. I would give it a 100 just because it is so uplifting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's a story, of a lovely lady...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lucille Ball has always been a favorite actress/comedienne of mine, and so this vehicle, Yours, Mine and Ours, was a good showcase for her talents. One year later, Florence Henderson was to "reprise" the same role in the Brady Bunch TV series. This movie has it over the Bradys hands down. When all of the kids that belonged to Henry Fonda's character met Lucille Balls' character for the first time, they got her drunk. Would never happen on the Brady Bunch. And all those kids! I think it was either 19 or 20! Much more responsibility in this combined household. Don't forget shopping day, with the caravan of shopping carts, I'm surprised collateral didn't have to be put up for the groceries. The idea here is that the sheer enormity of this situation makes it so hilarious, along with all the petty jealousies and conflicts inherent in all families, creates a movie that viewers can relate to on several levels. You don't need to have 20 kids to appreciate the film. The Brady Bunch seemed too perfect. The Norths and the Beardsleys had to put some tough love and effort into this to make it work, and this is reflected in Yours, Mine, and Ours. See it just for the fun of it. Look for Tom Bosley (Howard Cunningham of Happy Days) as the family doctor. Great fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, uplifting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in the movies back in 1968, when it was first released (I was about 5), and I've loved it since. Helen North (Lucy) is a widow with 8 kids, and Frank Beardsley (Fonda)is a navy captain with 10. They fall in love, and of course, bedlam ensues as they try to unite two families. Oh boy!!! Battling step-siblings, arguments over who gets which bedroom, resentments toward the new step-parents, etc. It ends happily, though, with the family pulling together to welcome the new baby (#19!) and learning to love and live together as a happy family.Lucy plays her role with wonderful, motherly warmth. You can actually see the love she has for each of those children, and her deep desire to have her new step-children love her. However - she does treat us to some delightful "Lucy"-ish antics. The scene in a crowded bar involving a wandering false eyelash and an uncooperative dress are absolutely classic - exactly the kind of comedy Lucy can do like no one else. And yet, these antics DO NOT dominate her performance or the film. They are just little "treats" thrown in every so often. Watch her expression, in the next to last scene, when Fonda's children tell her that she has been "adopted-as our mother, for life". Henry Fonda brings a nice, crisp authority to his role - it would have been easy to have made this man a caricature. A scene towards the end, where Lucy's oldest daughter turns to him for comfort and advice after dumping her oily boyfriend is lovely. Van Johnson has some good lines as Fonda's best friend. The kids are all very well cast, and included some "stars to be" - Tim Matheson, Tracy Nelson (she's one of the very youngest kids), Morgan Brittany (billed as Suzanne Cupito) and Eric Shea, better known as the "Robin" in POSEIDON ADVENTURE.In all, a heartwarming film, with a strong emphasis on life, second chances, and a very positive spin on beauty and bond of family love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...And Baby Makes... 21?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>YOURS, MINE, AND OURS reunites Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda, who had worked together in the 1942 B-film THE BIG STREET, the former a heavy-handed drama making a contrast to this lightweight comedy. Reminiscent of CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN, the premise -- a man and woman, both with a huge family, meet, fall in love, and marry -- would be unbelievable if it weren't true.Based on the autobiographical novel by Helen Eileen Beardsley, YOURS, MINES, AND OURS is a blueprint of sorts of future television shows "The Brady Bunch" and "Eight is Enough" but amps it up to eleven. While on those shows we never got to see just how a real household was handled (being situation programs, their stories were resolved in minimal time), here we get glimpses of what happens at dinnertime, or how groceries get done, and it's those trivial things that keep the charming story in check instead of throwing it into la-la land. Both Fonda and Ball are well-matched and have funny scenes together despite that both actors were a little too old for their characters, but it's not even a minor contrivance. Very enjoyable, witty, sunny: just what this kind of movie should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming, funny movie that makes you long for simpler days.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only is this perhaps my favorite movie of all time, but it has proved capable of attracting viewers much younger than myself (and in truth, I was not even born yet when this movie came out). My 2 and 11 year old daughters both enjoy this movie and will sit through it with me no matter how often I suggest it. In fact, my toddler asks for it by name at least once a week! I can't think of a single complaint, except perhaps to say that I envy those characters the simplicity of their lives. If only things were so simple today! And really, who can complain when it showcases a young Tim Matheson, giving us a glimpse of things to come (remember Animal House?)as well as a glimpse of the adorable Matheson sans shirt (his scene with Tom Bosley at the draft board physical is one of the funniest in the movie). One of my favorite things is watching this movie and looking at the faces of the kids, trying to see the adults they eventually became (Tracy Nelson at about age 3, Eric Shea was about 6 or 7, Morgan Brittany, who was a young teenager, and FYI to the person who commented about her appearances in the Old Navy ads: that was Morgan FAIRCHILD, NOT Morgan Brittany). And to those who complain incessantly about the ages of Ball and Fonda at the time the film was made, PLEASE! Get over it already! Half the fun of watching movies is being able to suspend disbelief for 2 hours. I think they looked awfully good, regardless of their "real" ages. This movie, once your kids get past their astonishment that people actually lived without 8 hours of TV a day, showed respect for their elders (most of the time), and got by without PlayStation 2 (!), is the perfect family movie. But oh, I wish 4 carts full of groceries still cost $126.63!! (Did anyone else notice that??) ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Helen Beardsley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I worked with Helen Beardsley at a hospital in Fresno, CA in the early 80's. She was a nice woman with a take-charge attitude. (I think you have to have one when you are the mother of 19 children.) She used to live in an ocean-view house in the Carmel area, but then sold it to move to Fresno. We always kidded her about doing that; she said the weather was better inland. I think that she was proud of her book and movie. She sold the rights to her movie early on, before it achieved sort of cult-favorite status. She told me that she regretted doing that. I did not know that she died until I read it on this comment page. I was sorry to read that; she wasn't that old and she was a strong woman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another reason to say "I Love Lucy"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, the movie is really quite dated. Perhaps this is why the movie sells for less than $9.99 on DVD. But in spite of its being dated, the movie is still very funny. Maybe it's funny because it is outdated. The movie was made a long, long time ago, in a day when "comedy" took priority over "politically correct". With Madelyn Davis and Bob Carroll, Jr writing the script, it couldn't be anything but a sure fire winner. The two also provided their talents on I LOVE LUCY. (Madelyn Davis was known as Madelyn PUGH during the I LOVE LUCY era).Lucille Ball, in this movie, has really taken a big risk in stepping out of her domain where she truly reigned as the queen of comedy. Her brilliance as a comedian has always been in her ability to act like the perfect scatterbrain, driving a totally frustrated straight man well past his breaking point with her totally insane schemes. On TV, this straight man was played by Desi Arnaz and later, by Gale Gordon.In this movie, Lucille Ball shone brighter than ever, showing an ability to go from "scatterbrain" to "serious to the point of tears" and back, so effortlessly. And there was no "straight man" to bounce her brand of comedy off of.Tom Bosely was hilarious as the family doctor, with his deadpan approach. Seeing him later as Howard Cunningham in HAPPY DAYS, I wonder if he was really acting or was he simply being himself? He certainly has that dry wit down to an art.Oh, and then, there is that issue of age. Lucille Ball was 57 and Henry Fonda was around 61 when the movie was made. This issue is obviously irrelevant. The movie was a hit when it was released in 1968. And it obviously beats that remake in 2005, hands down, in spite of the age of leading roles in the remake.Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda rule!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Lucy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lucille Ball reined above Hollywood as Queen of Comedy and also the CEO of Desilu with not one but three studio lots in Hollywood,Desilu Gower, Desilu Cahuenga and DesiluCulver ( The old Selznick Studio where Gone With The Wind was filmed). Taking chances was Lucy's forte: starring in a TV show "I Love Lucy" and insisting on the casting of her husband Desi Arnaz and her also equally famous decisions authorize the productions of "Star Trek" and "Mission Impossible" against the recommendations of the Desilu Board of Directors. Ball's last great accomplishment as a CEO was the insistence of filming "Yours Mine and Ours" as a theatrical movie hoping to make Desilu a force in film production as well. Make no doubt about it if one re reads the story that Rex Reed wrote in the New York Times on Lucy while she was filming this movie, Ms. Ball ran the show and event titled his great article on Lucy " I Run My Studio Like I Run My Home".Lucille Ball-looking youthful and beautiful- is superb in the title role of Helen Beardsley and her nuanced performance should have garnered Lucille Ball a long sought after Oscar nomination. Ms. Ball is at times both funny and in a departure from her TV "Lucy" quite soft and underplays many scenes. Henry Fonda is a perfect "Mr. Beardsley". Van Johnson a pal from Lucy's old MGM days is cast and gets a nice role supporting both Stars. Many were surprised by the success of this film. I have no idea why. It is a fine and lasting comedy classic directed by the sure hand of the fine Melville Shavelson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a cute movie, and unlike some viewers the ages of Ball and Fonda didn't bother me. I thought they did a great job in their parts. Some of the kids kind of bothered me, but I find this in a lot of older movies--they just don't seem "natural" like many child actors today do. But it is a sweet story.In answer to some queries here, I've read that there were actually problems between the makers of "The Brady Bunch" and "Yours, Mine, and Ours" due to the fact that the latter IS based on a real family and the former is fiction.However, as cute as the movie is, if you want to know the "real" story, I recommend you read Helen Beardsley's book "Who Gets the Drumstick". As is often the case, Hollywood took what was a great story and tried to make it "better" The portrayal of the family in the movie was not entirely accurate.SPOILERS COMPARING THE BOOK AND MOVIE1) The ages of some of the children were changed. Some of the girls, especially, were made older in the movie, I guess so they could have teenage angst!2) In reality, the children were all in favor of the wedding, and anxious for it to occur..3) Helen describes the children in favor of the adoptions (although I understand five of the eight original North children did change their name back). But they were all accepting of their "new" parent.Maybe the producers felt that 18 kids who came from two different families being willing to accept each other and not hate each other wouldn't fly, so they tried to spice it up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this movie except for a few points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm big on believability, so I'd have to agree that both Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda were a bit long in the tooth to be portraying parents whose oldest children were about sixteen and about fourteen at the time of their marriage. I read the original book by Helen Beardsley, "Who Gets the Drumstick," on which this film was based, long before seeing the film, so I remember from the book that at the time she was widowed, Helen North was 32 years old. No way would Lucy in her nurse's mufti pass for 33 in that infirmary scene with Henry Fonda. I can't remember how old Frank Beardsley was -- at least 8 or 10 years older than Helen, though. Still, Henry Fonda didn't pass for fortysomething when he opened the film with "Oh-nine-hundred" and looked at his watch on the way home to his kids.Second, the situation with Louise (which was not based on anything that happened in the book -- Frank Beardsley actually met Helen North through his sister, a nun in the school where Helen's kids enrolled after their father's death and their move from Washington State to the San Francisco area) struck me as completely incredulous. She was one of ten children, including seven sisters, and she's mad about having to share her room? Surely by the time she hit fourteen, she would've tried to make the best of the situation and learned that complaining did no good.Third, in the scene where Frank is away on the shakedown cruise and Helen opens one of his letters, the first thing you notice is La Lucille's flawlessly polished long nails and beautifully manicured hands. A mother of eighteen who spends her days scrubbing, cooking, and doing laundry does not have hands like this. My own mother only had five kids, and trust me, it doesn't work that way. LOLI have no idea what the real Beardsley family thought about the movie that portrayed their story. The original story as related in the book was really heartwarming, and I think the screenwriters should've been more faithful to the book. Helen Beardsley died on April 26, 2000 of complications from Parkinson's Disease. She was 70. I understand that Frank is still living.</fullReview>

Instead of laughing every 10 minutes, you laugh every 30 seconds. It is SO funny. I would recommend this to everyone. We all loved it (Family of: 40-50 yr old and a 13 year old and we all loved it. It shows a lot more then the new movie, So that's why we enjoyed it. The way they keep there selves hiding that they have so many children that they both had the same amount it's so funny. We loved how they hated every babysitter and mother (in the movie) and hid and scared them away in a week. It is one of the funniest movies in the world. It shows the truth about children to in all ages. Then they all work along after they started fighting (the two family's) It shows how 2 family's (18 kids) get along together in a hilarious way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry Fonda's entertaining vehicle with young people and agreeable actors . A widower Navy Admiral (Henry Fonda) and a lovely widow (Lucille Ball who produced the film with his company : Desilu Productions) fall in love and marry, much to the dismay of his 10 and her 8 children . He runs a loving but tight ship , with charts and salutes . The kids long for a permanent home . The film deals about a happy family , the father is a notorious Admiral and the mother is a nurse . They are instantly attracted to each other and quickly decide to marry . There are various family crisis but it is all very heartwarming . They are quite cognizant of the fact that he already has ten children from his first marriage, and she has eight from her first marriage . Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball ought to keep the familiar order involving in their own home while at the same time occupy the works .Then the problems start as two sets of kids, the free spirits and the disciplined preppies, must live together. The warring factions agree to work together to carry out the marriage .The picture is pretty entertaining and amusing , the film contains bemusing scenes , zany shenanigans , continuous laughters and various chuckles with lots of fun . Humanity and humor are high in the priorities of the director Shavelson who shows a considerable talent recapturing funny situations . The picture belongs to numerous family sub-genre whose maxim representation is ¨Cheaper by dozen ¨ with Myrna Loy and Clifton Webb and a modern version starred by Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt ; and of course ¨Yours , mine and ours¨ , being recently remade (2005) by Raja Gosnell with Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo . Formidable main cast , very well featured by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball . Besides , there appears as sons ,some young actors who will have an acceptable career as TV stars as Morgan Brittany , Tim Matheson and Tracy Nelson .The motion picture was well directed by Melville Shavelson . His movies have a special penchant for recapturing a particular atmosphere , many of this movies are about real people but they remain muted in impact . A notorious screenwriter , Bob Hope and Danny Kaye features Shavelson's movies when he became filmmaker and his films with them are the most successful such as ¨The seven tittle Foys¨ , Beau James¨, ¨On the Double¨ and ¨Five pennies¨ . Shavelson's later pictures were made for TV and mostly biographies as ¨The great Houdini¨ , ¨Ike¨, ¨Ike : the war years¨, and ¨The legend of Valentino¨ which remains the best work on the subject to date . Two of the best films resulted to be ¨¨Cast a giant shadow¨ , an epic movie with all-star-cast dealing with the birth of Israel and this ¨Yours , mine and ours¨.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matheson, Shea and even Bosley made it for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently seen this movie again and it has aged well, maybe because I didn't recall so much of it when I was little. In my younger years, to see Lucille Ball in anything else made me expect The Lucy Show or Here's Lucy, both of which I watched sunup to sundown. Whether it was Yours, MIne &amp; Ours or Mame, I was looking for the screwy redhead.In watching it straight thru this time, I enjoyed the actual focus on life at that time and tending to so many kids, such as the grocery shopping, breakfast and laundry time. The dating seemed a bit hokey to me and HOllywooded, but believe it or not, Jane Fonda has revealed on a Barbara Walters interview that there was sparks between her father and Ms. Ball.Still it was Tim Matheson (the voice of Jonny Quest) and Eric Shea (the voice of Linus Van Pelt) who kept it moving. While Matheson resented the new family and mother, he wasn't hostile to Shea, who was indeed lost in the shuffle and going his own path. Ball might have been able to conceal her age more had her voice not have been gone as it was, which for some reason makes her seem older anyway.Still, things like the phone call with one of Fonda's daughters listening in was priceless and truly hilarious, but Ball's conversation with the nun about Shea's last name, was it North or Beardsley now, was clumsy and awkward and really could have been structured better.I did not realize this was based on a true story, which makes it all the more incredible.Actually, Sherwood Schwartz had proposed the idea for the Brady Bunch to networks several years before and they wouldn't buy the show until the success of Yours, MIne and Ours and With Six, You Get Eggroll, then the Brady Bunch got the major league green light. Also "Here's Lucy" was to be similar to Yours, MIne and Ours with her having a bunch of kids, but that was dropped in favor of her two real kids.And worth noting, ubiquitous Larry Hankin appears as the grocery clerk, Harry. Hankin appears in programs and movies over the next three decades, but may be best recognized as the television Kramer on Seinfeld, when Jerry sold the show within his show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yours, Mine and Ours (1968): Dir: Melville Shavelson / Cast: Henry Fonda, Lucille Ball, Tom Bosley, Van Johnson, Walter Brooke: Seems like a remake of Cheaper by the Dozen but director Melville Shavelson manages to heighten a theme of family and togetherness. Henry Fonda plays a Navy veteran while Lucille Ball plays a nurse and their stories come together in a detailed narrative where we learn that they're both widowed and he has ten children while she has eight. That is more sex combined than a whole slew of porn stars, and more labour pain than one human body should desire. Although insightful and clever it is also very obvious. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that they will marry and the children will struggle to adapt. What does work is the two leads. Fonda is terrific as a devoted father yet he misses he place within the Navy. Ball is hilarious particularly during a drunken dinner segment. Supporting roles are flat but then again who can keep track of these children? It is mind boggling to ponder someone having this many children. Tom Bosley is given a few witty lines as a doctor but even his appearance is pretty much standard issue. The kids are so many that one would think that popcorn had more personality. The film stresses the ordeal of raising a family and building bridges when something is missing...Such as why so many children? Score: 5 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long before the Duggar family tried breaking the world record for number of births to a single mother (which is 69), there was this film, itself based on a true story of exponential proportions.Henry Fonda stars as Frank Beardsley, a widowed Navy officer with ten children and Lucille Ball as Helen North-Beardsley with her own eight children. That was eighteen children, a lot back in the 1960s when this film was released. To add to that, they had a child together, making it nineteen.This is a good clean, family friendly film that adults and children alike will be able to enjoy. It's a shame that films like this aren't made in today's time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's Lucy with The Beardsley Bunch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Should a widow with eight children marry a widower with ten? Well, yes, if the lady is played by Lucille Ball. This movie is heavily dependent on Ms. Ball, who manages to carry the film on her comic shoulders. It's nice to see an older actress playing a beautiful, romantic leading role; and, watching Ball is the main attraction, after all these years. The situation is something different than anything she would do on television, at the time. Herein, there are subtle, snickering sex (and drug) jokes.Mostly, you get to see how Ball and Henry Fonda (as Helen and Frank Beardsley) manage merging their reluctant offspring. This situation plays better than "The Lucy Show" meets "The Brady Bunch" (that latter show must have been inspired, at least in part, by the success of this film). The earlier "courtship" scenes are sweeter, and funnier, than the remainder of the film.In a large cast of children, it's difficult to stand out - unless the script gives you something to do. Tim Matheson (as Mike) and Eric Shea (as Phillip) are the luckiest recipients. And, Jennifer Leak (as Colleen) gets to fend off Ben Murphy, her "frustrated, sex maniac" boyfriend.****** Yours, Mine and Ours (4/24/68) Melville Shavelson ~ Lucille Ball, Henry Fonda, Tim Matheson, Van Johnson</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Yours, Mine and Ours" was based on the true life story, Who Gets the Drumstick??.written by Helen Beardsley. This was a wonderful film starring two of Hollywood's greatest legends; Henry Fonda, and Lucille Ball. Both have recently lost their spouse and are trying to come grips with life as a single parent...and at the same time, provide a stable home for their children. Helen North (Lucille Ball) has 10 children while Frank Beardsley (Henry Fonda) has 8. Frank Captains an aircraft carrier while Helen is a Nurse in the Navy. They first meet after crashing into each others shopping basket at the local market. Later, they meet again after Frank takes his daughter in for a checkup. That leads to their first date. The funny thing is?neither has a clue about each others kids. As fate would have it, they fall in love. That's were things really get interesting.What makes this film great is the fact that they present real issues that most blended families face. It's not always pretty. The struggles are real. However with the use of humor, you get a good sense of what it is like on the inside.The cast was wonderful. Van Johnson played Franks Navy buddy. He was wonderful. Tom Bosley played the befuddled family doctor, while Tim Matheson (aka-The West Wing) played Franks oldest son. This was film making at it's best. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you pick it up. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

I met Lucille Ball one time on the set of that movie while they were filming the date seen at night.I was even an extra in a walking seen at age nine. I met Desi about two years later. The most alarming thing that happened is when Lucille Ball arrived at the set, she was mobbed by fans. This took on a tragic result when the fans nearly turned over her car. The police came out with clubs and hit everyone. Later that night Henry Fonda came out and started telling jokes. My mother and I met him then. The pretend wedding was filmed at the " San Fernando Mission " in Los Angeles since it was easy to secure. My parents attended the ceremony.

		<shortDescription>Nothing special...just a little snappy warmth on a cold night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, this movie isn't anything special...but I like it very much any way. Yes, as one of our reviewers points out (again, as she does over and over for movie after movie), the two principals are too old for their parts. So what? Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball were very good together in this film...good chemistry. End of story. And anyone who constantly worries about the age of the actors -- except in rare extreme cases -- ought to quite watching movies and stick to reading non-fiction.There's a lot that's predictable here, but it's still enjoyable. While very loosely based on a true story, it reminds me just a tad of "Cheaper By The Dozen" -- the real one (not the pap remake). And yes, we know the story has been fictionalized, so drop that old chestnut, too.We usually think of Henry Fonda as a dramatic actor, but I always thought he had a flair for comedy. There's something about his delivery here that just hit the spot. Other than the drunk scene, this is not the sit-com Lucy. Lucy was a fairly good movie actress, as well, and she did well here. Poor Van Johnson; not a very good role for him...almost superfluous.Of the child actors here, and they are legion, only Tim Matheson is a name most of us will recognize. I always felt he was an underrated actor, although he hadn't quite earned his water wings here, yet.This film could have been sappy, but instead it's snappy, and still sentimental. It may not be your cup of tea, but it was a winner at the box office, and it's obvious why. Well worth a watch!</fullReview>

Henry Fonda and Van Johnson give able support but it is Lucille Ball's picture and Lucy scored a great hit. Lucille Ball was robbed of an Oscar nomination for her superb performance. Some have carped re Ms. Ball being in her mid 50's playing a much younger woman but to me the film works because of Ms. Ball who looks wonderful in the film.Paramount Pictures bought adjacent Desilu after this movie was made, and when Yours Mine and Ours was such a hit, Desilu's 25% was paid from United Artists to Paramount! Lucille Ball also owned outright 25% of the movie and made millions on this film.This one of my favorite films.Bravo Lucy</fullReview>

I wish that the DVD had more information because I want to know if the actor, Eric Shea, lost his teeth during filming. Did they adapt his lines to fit his loss of teeth or did they give him false teeth for the earlier shot.I would like to see this movie with additional features.

		<fullReview>YOURS, MINE, &amp; OURS is the 1968 family classic based on a true story that, among other things, was an inspiration for the TV series THE BRADY BUNCH. This warm and entertaining comedy stars Lucille Ball as Helen North, a widowed naval nurse, who is the mother of eight children who meets and falls in love with Frank Beardsley (Henry Fonda), a widowed naval officer, who is the father of ten children and the obvious complications that ensue when Helen and Frank decide to marry and blend their families. There are no surprises here...the children obviously object to the union and still think of themselves as separate families despite Frank and Helen's efforts to bring them together, but everything does eventually iron itself out in true sitcom style. Lucille Ball has one of her best film roles here, playing it relatively straight as Helen, but the Lucy we know and love does get to shine through in a couple of comic scenes...one at a crowded bar where she does battle with a slip and a fake eyelash and during a dinner at Frank's house where Frank's sons have spiked her drink and she gets very drunk. Fonda proves to have a surprising gift for light comedy and his chemistry with Ball is unexpectedly solid. Van Johnson is very funny as the mutual friend who brings them together and Tom Bosley has some funny moments as the family doctor. There are several future stars featured in the film as the North/Beardsley children, including Tim Matheson, Gil Rogers, Morgan Brittany, Mitch Vogel, and Tracy Nelson. A true family classic that still makes me laugh out loud after almost 40 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That This Group Would Somehow Form A Family, That's The Way They Became The Beardsley-North Bunch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally when Lucille Ball wanted to film this story, she had that noted television father Fred MacMurray in mind for the role of the Navy widower with 10 kids. That would have been an interesting project had that team come about. Lucy and Fred worked, but one time on the Lucy/Desi Comedy hour, but never on the big screen. When Fred proved unavailable, Lucy went and got Henry Fonda her co-star years ago in The Big Street.I'm told that in The Films of Henry Fonda, he welcomed the idea of doing Your's, Mine and Our's. He had done a bunch of westerns around this time of varying kind and looked for a change of pace. The last family type film Fonda had done was Spencer's Mountain which got less than overwhelming reviews.But with television's number one comedy star both starring and producing there was certainly guaranteed box office. To Lucy's credit she did not hog the whole film and allowed Fonda his comedy moments.You also won't be seeing any outrageous Lucy type moments either in the film. Partially that was a bow towards her age and, but more it was a realization that such things as the chocolate factory or stomping the grapes just didn't go in this film.The film was based on a true story although it was set and written in the early Sixties of the Kennedy years. I'm sure in producer Lucille Ball's mind a few years wouldn't really make a difference. But in point of fact in America of the Sixties it was a night and day type difference. I'm sure many in the audience were asking whether this really was reflective of 1968.Van Johnson as Fonda's naval buddy and Tom Bosley as an overworked doctor contribute their bits in her. It's not a bad film over all, but isn't a great effort for either of its stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brady Bunch on steroids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This and Captains Courageous (Freddie Bartholomew's version) are easily my two favorite movies of all time. I've not even seen the 2005 remake, and given the reviews it got, I might not bother.I do have some problems, mostly with character portrayal. These problems, however, are not the fault of the acting but of the writing and directing. To wit:1.) Colleen North, aka Little Miss Histrionics. Hard for me to tell whether Jennifer Leak was overacting, or whether Colleen was supposed to be played as such a dramatic, hyper-emotional teenage girl always bordering on the hysterical.2.) Susan Beardsley, the human garbage disposal. Holly O'Brien was merely pudgy, not actually fat, but it was enough to play on the stereotype. Everyone knows that if you have extra weight, it means you have no control over yourself. Eating is all you ever do. Thus Susan takes twice as much (or more) at the table, and then finishes what everyone else leaves behind. And her eyes light up like Christmas at the mention of food. Thank you, Hollywood, for such an accurate and sensitive portrayal of weight issues.3.) Would Helen, a nurse, actually question her own judgment and ask hubby if he thinks her son has a temperature? I don't think he would have doubted himself and asked her opinion about Navy shipbuilding. That's his area of expertise. Nursing is hers. Or was she trying to score points by playing the helpless damsel in distress waiting for her knight in shining armor?4.) The fight between Helen and Sister Mary Alice over Beardsley vs. North wouldn't have happened. At the first sign of conflict, any teacher in any school would have referred the matter to the principal rather than keep arguing with the parent.These complaints are trivial, though, compared to the things I love about the film. I have listed everything I didn't like about the movie, but I cannot list everything I did like, because it would involve literally everything else. Nothing in this world is perfect, so "Yours, Mine, and Ours" probably comes as close as possible. I loved seeing Lucille Ball as a real woman, a person with some semblance of intelligence, as opposed to that incompetent mockery of a housewife that Ricky Ricardo even felt entitled to spank sometimes for misbehaving. I loved Helen's gentle but effective dig at the judge who praised her by criticizing his own wife. The children are adorable. Much positive press has been given to Eric Shea as Philip North Beardsley (and rightfully so) but it was Michelle Tobin's Veronica who really stole my heart. As for the older children, in contrast to Colleen's drama queen act, I was much more drawn to the responsible, level-headed Rosemary as played by Nancy Roth.The scenes at the bar and at the Japanese restaurant were outright hysterical, and that Chinese doll Helen and Frank were admiring in the store window...oh, the looks on their faces when the proprietor said the f-word (fertility)!9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your Mine and Ours was released on April 24, 1968 in the United States. Yours, Mine and Ours is a 1968 film, directed by Melville Shavelson and starring Lucille Ball, Henry Fonda and Van Johnson. Before its release, it had three other working titles: The Beardsley Story, Full House, and His, Hers, and Theirs. It was based loosely on the story of Frank and Helen Beardsley, although Desilu Productions bought the rights to the story long before Helen's autobiographical book Who Gets the Drumstick? was released to bookstores. Screenwriters Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll wrote several I Love Lucy-style stunts that in most cases had no basis in the actual lives of the Beardsley family, before Melville Shavelson and Mort Lachman took over primary writing duties. The film was commercially successful, and even the Beardsleys themselves appreciated it. This film was remade in 2005 with Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo as Frank and Helen Beardsley.Summary: Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball take turns providing voice-over narration throughout?and in at least one scene, Van Johnson talks directly to the camera (a technique known as breaking the fourth wall), as does Fonda. Henry Fonda's character, Frank Beardsley, is a Roman Catholic Navy warrant officer, recently detached from the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and assigned as project officer for the Fresnel lens glide-slope indicator, or "meatball," that would eventually become standard equipment on all carriers. Lucille Ball's character, Helen North, is a Roman Catholic nurse working in the dispensary at the California naval base to which Frank is assigned. Frank meets Helen, first by chance in the commissary on the Naval base (presumably Alameda Naval Air Station, though it is never identified) and then when Frank brings his distraught teen-age daughter for treatment at the dispensary, where Helen informs him that the young lady is simply growing up in a too-crowded house that lacks a mother's guidance. They immediately hit it off and go on a date, all the while shying away from admitting their respective secrets: Frank has ten children and Helen has eight, from previous marriages that ended in their spouses' deaths. When each finally learns the other's secret, they initially resist their mutual attraction. However, Chief Warrant Officer Darrell Harrison (Van Johnson) is determined to bring them together. To that end, he "fixes up" each of them with a blind date that is sure to be incompatible. Helen's date is an obstetrician (Sidney Miller) who stands a good head shorter than she does; this prompts Helen to observe in voice-over, "Darrell had a malicious sense of humor." Frank's date is a "hip" girl (Louise Troy) who is not only young enough to be one of his daughters, but also is far too forward for his taste. As the final touch, Harrison makes sure that both dates take place in the same Japanese restaurant. As Harrison fully expects, Frank and Helen end up leaving the restaurant together in his car, with Frank's date sitting uncomfortably between the two as they carry on about their children.Questions: Did Frank and Helen date after meeting at a restaurant? What do three of Franks do to Helen? What happens to Helen? Does Frank believe his children? Do the children fight the change? What does the children do after the hear the major announcement? What's going on between Philip North and his teacher? What kind of discussion does Frank and Helen have? Is it about the children? My thoughts: This movie was a waste of time and it was bad. Talent used in this movie never was there so I give this movie 1 weasel</fullReview>

My personal favorite part of the movie is when the Norths/Beardsleys move into their new home during a rainstorm and a power outage.

		<shortDescription>If you can overlook a few things...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the fact that this kind of formula comedy about a couple merging with too many children as part of their instant family, has been done so many times either in books, television or movies--and always the results are a rather mixed bag.The other hurdle to jump is the fact that neither LUCILLE BALL nor HENRY FONDA have any more chemistry together than they did when she played the sharp-tongued broad of THE BIG STREET and he was the dope who still loved her after being mistreated. Even then, there was no evident chemistry between them as romantically linked souls.Here it's the same, except that they have to contend with the usual shenanigans that happen when their unhappy brood of children form an instant dislike to their new parents and threaten to run away. There's a nice supporting role for VAN JOHNSON as a friend of the family, and it's interesting to see TIM MATHESON and MORGAN BITTANY as two of the kids in their early roles, but the picture is an uneven assortment of the kind of gags that usually perpetuate this kind of family comedy.Less importantly, they're both a little too old for these roles but that's not really the main drawback. The genuine humor inherent in such a situation as this is more contrived than natural except for a few funny moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 18 children aside, can you believe Lucille Ball in love with Henry Fonda?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Headache-inducing comedy-drama, based on a true story (!), apparently has quite a faithful following. I remember seeing it on television in the prime-time hour years ago and it was a big ratings hit. Plot has widow Lucille Ball--and her eight children--marrying officer and widower Henry Fonda--and his 10 children. Kids seemed to get a kick out of the chaos and, indeed, Lucy works hard at being flexible and warm, but Fonda is such a cold fish, such a moody old cuss and strict disciplinarian (with a one-note voice that only seems to modulate between stern-and-steely and stern-and-loud), that I found the one main ingredient in "Yours, Mine and Ours" impossible to swallow: the romance. Ball and Fonda were previously paired much earlier in "The Big Street", which wasn't very convincing in the love-department either, but finding them matched up in this busy, bustling family affair is almost depressing; there's no connection. Some funny moments, and the picture looks handsome enough, but the plot predicaments get tiresome. Worse, all the character development is given to the adults and the kids don't even get a chance to shine. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch what happens when this widow and widower get together!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lucille Ball is a widower with eight children and Henry Fonda is a widower with ten kids! Watch what happens when they get together in this funny movie. Yours, Mine and Ours is not a great film. In fact, it has some obvious flaws in the plot (Lucy having a baby at about sixty years old!) being the biggest one! The directing is not great. The same can be said for the dialogue because it is just passable. Sometimes you can even catch Lucy and Henry in a scene that they are not quite pulling off. However, the odd thing about this movie, as cornball as it is, is that it makes one laugh most of the time, and at the end, the sappy story tugs at our heartstrings. Definitely worth watching. Somehow, this movie manages to be much better than it should be. Maybe it's the the two veteran stars (Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda) who are playing misfits in the late 1960's hip culture, maybe it's the cute and mischievous kids or maybe even it's the upbeat optimistic tone of this film that makes it all work. Whatever it is, "Yours, Mine and Ours" is worth seeing. I'd give it an 89/100.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one of those movies I'd really like to like, because the actors are good in their roles and the comedy is well paced with hilarious moments, but the underlying message spoils all the good sides.As Fonda character explains to his daughter during one chaotic scene: love is not for fun but *just* for producing children (a good number of them) and then... you make them go to the war (look at the final).Still I wonder:*how the children were able to survive in such a situation: in a big family you have to fight for parents' care and attention (my granny words for that)... then you see your competitors doubled!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yours Mine and Ours is the tender, touching and tantalizing tale of a mildly retarded 70-year-old red-headed woman who accidentally gets drunk and then miraculously gets pregnant with a baby. A complex color- and number-coded system teaches the children the value of sticking to their own bedroom and bathroom, and not only is a good time had by all, but a valuable lesson is learned by all. Nancy Roth's near-award-winning role as Rosemary Beardsley is a haunting practice in joie de vivre, as is Mr. Tom Bosley in the role of the cuddly, mildly hairy gentleman known as "Family Doctor." Keep your eyes open for a young Larry Hankin as "Supermarket Clerk/Harry."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best family film I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily the best family picture I've ever seen.Lucille Ball, Henry Fonda, and Van Johnson are all perfectly cast and play their roles with skill and realism. Ball in particular is given one of her warmest, most human roles here, and this is indeed my favorite of all of Ms. Ball's films for that reason. All of the ancillary adult characters and the children as well are well cast and given some degree of depth (and let's face it, it would be quite challenging to fully flesh out the characters of 18 different children in a movie that runs under two hours). Most of the kids we deal with directly in this film do seem real enough, as opposed to the annoying child actors that usually populate family films.Based on a true story, widow Helen North relocates her brood of eight children from Seattle to San Francisco, where she runs into widower Frank Beardsley, the father of ten, while working as a nurse in the base infirmary. Although there is instant chemistry between the two, they decide against a relationship while on their first date, when they realize the size of their combined families. To the rescue comes Frank's best friend, Darrel, who manages to maneuver the two back together by setting them each up with a comically mismatched date and sending them to the same restaurant.One of the movie's strengths is that it's not all build-up, as old time romance movies tend to be. Here we actually get to see Helen and Frank married in the first half of the film and then what their family life is like afterward. While it may appear on the surface to be a series of mundane occurrences (doing laundry, tending to a sick child, grocery shopping, family dinner arguments, a young girl's first party dress, Christmas morning, even the military precision necessary to feed 18 children breakfast and get them off to school), it works on a much deeper level and shows the viewer the great selfless compassion and love the parents have for the children, and ultimately the children have for the parents. While not as hip as the same year's "With Six You Get Eggroll", this depiction of a decidedly more old-fashioned family is more endearing and really more entertaining. I feel compelled to also address some of the peculiar complaints posted here by previous reviewers, not a subject I would normally delve into in this forum. For starters, the actual ages of Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in 1968 do not bother me in the least, nor do they detract from the film in any way I can see. A good actor can easily portray a character 10-15 years younger or older than themselves, which is what is done here. I would expect the parents of near-grown teen-agers to be mature adults, and it would have been far more distracting if they hadn't. Further, it is always refreshing to see a romance between grown people instead of some 17 year old juvenile delinquents, which is the usual cast of a romance movie. And for whoever complained about Lucy's nails, c'mon!! Good Lord! Yes, it IS possible. I have cleaned, kept house, prepared meals, grocery shopped, gardened, raised children, done laundry, sewn, and even performed the occasional minor car repair with "long manicured nails" my entire adult life (which I will admit dates back to the time of this film). It can be done with little more than a competent manicurist.Having said that, one of the truest tests of an excellent film is "re-watchability", and this one gets watched in our home every single Christmas and a half dozen more times throughout the year. Highly recommended.**Note: While the DVD of this movie is unfortunately in the incorrect full-screen format, Turner Classic Movies occasionally airs this film and they show it in its proper widescreen format.</fullReview>

A splendid view of the extreme of trying to bring 2 families together, Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda are simply fantastic. It's also a great chance to see Tim Matheson before he became famous in "Animal House." It also tackles a lot of issues that people have today, divorce, remarriage, teenage love lives, and children going off to the service. Simply incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ball and Fonda Elevate a Sitcom-Level Domestic Farce Where Pro-Life Family Values Dominate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this old-fashioned family comedy came out in 1968 because I saw it from the back of my parents' Rambler station wagon at a suburban drive-in. Ironically, it was released about a month before Robert Kennedy was assassinated, a pertinent fact since he was the Kennedy brother with by far the most children - eleven. The wholesome image of Kennedy as a young family man with a large brood is what much of the country responded to at the time, and this movie echoes those sentiments on a broader, sitcom level. It helps when you have two veterans like Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda play the leading roles as the widowed parents of sizable broods that combine eighteen children. One is a screen icon, the other America's most beloved TV comedienne. In hindsight, it seems predictably cautious for a movie set around the Alameda Naval Base to ignore the Vietnam War entirely, even though Fonda plays a naval officer and his oldest son a draftee.The plot is based on a true story as recounted in a 1964 memoir by Ball's character Helen North Beardsley. She was a part-time nurse on the base and a recently widowed mother of eight. In typical meet-cute fashion at the grocery store, Helen bumps into naval officer Frank Beardsley, the recently widowed father of ten children. They meet again at the clinic when his daughter needs female attention for her budding young womanhood. Their first date leads to the mutual revelation of the size of their respective families. Frank's best friend and fellow officer Darrel Harrison also knows Helen well and is determined to get them together through a pair of mismatched blind dates. Once Frank and Helen realize they are made for each other, the couple spends the rest of the movie trying to meld their warring families together into one happy unit. It's hardly a spoiler to say that they eventually succeed but not without a lot of trial and tribulation - including another baby on the way.Truth be told, Ball and Fonda are too old by a decade or so for their roles. However, it doesn't really matter since they are immensely likable here. Even though she is given plenty of Lucy schtick to do between false eyelashes and toxic screwdrivers, Ball lends surprising dimension to Helen when it matters. Van Johnson is in typical wise-guy mode as Darrel, while Tom Bosley shows up as the befuddled family doctor. Among the children, you can recognize Tim Matheson as the eldest and most resentful of the pack and Morgan Brittany as a middle daughter, though the scene stealer is Eric Shea, who would have a memorable turn as the crafty kid in "The Poseidon Adventure" four years later. Reflecting on this film forty years later, I am struck by the pro-life message it seems to encourage, although religious themes are smartly avoided. The whole venture was directed and co-written by journeyman Melville Shavelson. The 2006 DVD only offers the original theatrical trailer as the one extra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liked the movie, want the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our whole family has always enjoyed this movie. Before coming to this site, however, I didn't know that it was based on a true story. My wife likes the movie (she likes almost anything with Lucille Ball in it) so I will probably get her a copy of the book as a gift. Even if the movie departs from the book significantly, I still believe that reading the true story would only enhance enjoyment of the movie. I would like to thank the IMDB people for creating the format that enables this type of information to be shared.In my opinion, the movie is carried by a masterful rendition by the three main stars - Lucille Ball, Henry Fonda, and Van Johnson. Each of these is a personal favorite, so I may be prejudiced, but I can't imagine anyone else in these roles. And not only did the ages of Fonda and Ball not bother me, but it never occurred to me that there might have been a problem there. (Hollywood does a good job with makeup, and I failed to pull out my almanac while watching the movie to check on the stars' ages.) I have had friends with almost pure white hair become parents. An uncle started going very gray in his early thirties. So age and the appearance of age are very relative. Just enjoy this great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect movie to advocate birth control</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Yours, Mine, and Ours" is obviously a predecessor of "The Brady Bunch", only this time Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda play a widow and widower who fall in love, get married, and try to bring all 18 (can you believe it, 18!) of their children together so they can raise their family as one. Cute idea, right? It had promise, but this movie annoyed me very much. All those bratty kids made me want to give them a good smacking. The scene where Lucy gets drunk because the kids spike her drink was meant to be funny, but instead I felt it was sad and pathetic. Definitely NOT the hilarious Lucy I know! Although, I did like the speech that Fonda gives to one of his daughters on what real love is and why she should date someone other than her current loser boyfriend who's pressuring her to go all the way.Yes, the movie has definitely aged, very much a 60s movie, despite being made in 1968 when so many of the movies in the late 60s reflected the rebelliousness and counterculture instead of family values. Not one of Fonda's or Lucy's best. The end was very predictable and *mild spoiler* I knew Lucy's character would get pregnant again. Heck, they have 18, why not add one more, I say? Ha ha. Average. Recommended only if you think the movie will be cute or if you think bratty, snotty kids are funny.</fullReview>

Any woman who willingly gives birth 10 times should have been forced to become sterilized several "pops" ago.What kind of message is this kind of "comedy" sending to the next generation of parents? We're not living in the dark ages of pre-Victorian times. This is the real world, and it's been REAL for a while now. Let's keep focused and agree that HUMUNGOUS FAMILIES are nothing to find amusing, but real cause for worry! -- The scene where Fonda dispenses the daily rations of bath towels is absolutely ridiculous. Never in a billion years! There are some good jokes here, but my laughter was always stifled by the thought of this kids-loving super-family. Don't let YOUR kids see this!</fullReview>
